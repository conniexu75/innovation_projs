https://openalex.org/W1544916933,"the oxi3 locus of yeast mitochondrial DNA has been sequenced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D273-10B. The sequence was obtained from the mitochondrial genomes of a series of cytoplasmic petite mutants selected for the retention of genetic markers in the oxi3 locus. The oxi3 locus has been ascertained to code for Subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase. The Subunit 1 gene is 9,979 nucleotides long, consisting of seven to eight exons that account for only 16% of the gene sequence. The coding sequences have been identified on the basis of protein sequence homology with Subunit 1 of human cytochrome oxidase. The yeast Subunit 1 is 510 amino acid residues long and has a molecular weight of 56,000. In addition to the exon sequences, the Subunit I gene contains six to seven introns. The first four introns have long reading frames that are continuous with the exon coding sequences. These reading frames are potentially capable of coding for basic proteins with molecular weights ranging from 30,000 to 80,000. The first two introns of the gene have a sequence homology of 50%, while the reading frame of the fourth intron is 70% homologous with an intron of the apocytochrome b gene. At least five stable transcripts have been found by Northern blot hybridizations with single-stranded DNA probes containing either exon or intron sequences. A 1.9-kolobase transcript hybridizes only with probes from the exon regions of the gene. This RNA species has been tentatively identified as the fully processed messenger of Subunit 1. Other transcripts are detected with intron probes. Three transcripts with sizes of 2.5, 2.4, and 0.85 kilobases appear to be stable excision products from the first, second, and fifth introns."
https://openalex.org/W1512693490,"Certain naturally occurring lipids (phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, arachidonic acid) and sodium dodecyl sulfate activate at least two calmodulin-dependent enzymes, bovine brain 3':5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and chicken gizzard myosin light chain kinase in the absence of Ca2+. 2-p-Toluidinyl-naphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS), which is often used as a probe for hydrophobic groups of proteins, inhibits these two calmodulin-dependent enzymes. Kinetic analysis of inhibition of chicken gizzard myosin kinase by TNS revealed a competitive fashion against calmodulin-induced activation. The interaction between TNS and purified bovine brain calmodulin as demonstrated in the appearance of TNS fluorescence in the presence of 3 microM or more of calcium ion was not observed in the presence of 2 mM EGTA. This suggests that TNS is able to bind to calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+. Moreover, a calmodulin-interacting agent N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide suppressed the TNS fluorescence induced by complex formation with calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+. These results suggest that when Ca2+ binds to the high affinity sites of calmodulin, it induces a conformational change which exposes hydrophobic groups, and the calmodulin is then capable of activating calmodulin-dependent enzymes. We propose that hydrophobic properties of Ca2+-calmodulin are important for the activation of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1566040275,"The product of the avian sarcoma virus transforming gene (src) is a phosphoprotein of 60,000 daltons (pp60src) which is responsible for the oncogenic potential of the virus. Recent findings indicate that this protein possesses an affiliated protein kinase activity. We have determined by hydrodynamic measurements and gel filtration that this kinase activity tracks with a highly asymmetric molecule of 60,000 daltons, strengthening the idea that pp60src alone (as opposed to a complex) possesses the enzymatic activity. To more fully characterize the properties of this kinase activity, we undertook its purification by two independent methods. In each case, a protein related to pp60src was extensively purified from contaminating cellular proteins. The yields from one of the procedures were sufficient to induce high titer monospecific antibodies against pp60src in mice. We have shown that purified pp60src is able to phosphorylate several protein substrates other than IgG. The conclusion that pp60src possesses the responsible enzymatic activity was strengthened by demonstrating that a temperature-sensitive conditional mutation in src affected the thermal stability of the purified protein. It has recently been shown that the protein kinase activity affiliated with pp60src phosphorylates tyrosine residues on IgG. We have examined the target specificity of the purified protein on several substrates other than IgG, and show that in every case, the phosphorylation occurs exclusively at a tyrosine residue; it therefore appears that tyrosine phosphorylatin is not an artifact of phosphorylation in th immunoprecipitate, but instead represents the general substrate specificity of pp60src."

https://openalex.org/W1534965462,"A protein (FA) has been isolated from rabbit muscle which has two functions: one is the activation of the ATP x Mg-dependent phosphatase (see previous paper) (1) and the second is the phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation of glycogen synthase, independent from cyclic AMP or Ca ions. The two activities co-purify throughout the purification scheme, and reside in the single protein band that the purified preparation shows in discontinuous acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Heat inactivation experiments with the purified protein showed a parallel decrease of both activities with time. GTP could efficiently replace the ATP in both reactions. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis also shows a single protein-stained band corresponding to a Mr = approximately 50,000 and sucrose density gradient centrifugation gave a value of 45,000. The enzyme incorporates only 1 mol of phosphate/mol of synthase monomer (85,000 daltons) and brings the activity ratio (+/- glucose-6-P) down to less than 0.05. Kinetic studies suggest that FA exerts its two activities in quite different ways: the activation of the ATP x Mg-dependent phosphatase is bought about by a protein-protein interaction (FA x FC complex formation) with ATP x Mg as a necessary cofactor, whereas for the inactivation of synthase, FA is a cyclic AMP- and Ca-independent kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1578370366,"An ATP x Mg-dependent protein phosphatase (FC) was purified to near homogeneity from rabbit muscle. The enzyme was completely devoid of any spontaneous activity but could be activated by a protein activator (FA) in the presence of ATP and Mg ions. The inactive phosphatase migrated as a single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and in discontinuous gel electrophoresis, where the potential phosphatase activity was located in the main protein band. The molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis or by sucrose density centrifugation was found to be 70,000. FC migrated on gel filtration as a 140,000 molecular weight species. The activation by FA was not paralleled by an incorporation of [32P]-phosphate into the ATP x Mg-dependent phosphatase, and from the kinetics of activation a protein-protein interaction with ATP x Mg as a necessary factor, can be inferred as the mechanism of activation. After activation by FA and ATP X Mg, the purified enzyme had a specific activity of 10,000 units/mg of protein, and a Km for rabbit muscle phosphorylase a of approximately 1.0 mg/ml. The activated enzyme did not release [32P]phosphate from 32[-labeled rabbit muscle synthase b, prepared from glucagon-treated dogs. It did, however, remove all the 32P label from phosphorylase b kinase, autophosphorylated to the level of 2.0 mol/mol of 1.3 X 10(6) molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W1591714237,"A comparison was made of the activity of the UV-specific endonucleases of bacteriophage T4 (T4 endonuclease V) and of Micrococcus luteus on ultravilet light-irradiated DNA substrates of defined sequence. The two enzymes cleave DNA at the site of pyrimidine dimers with the same frequency. The products of the cleavage reaction are the same, suggesting that the scission of DNA by T4 endonuclease V occurs via the combined actin of a pyrimidine dimer specific DNA glycosylase and an apyrimidinic-apurinic (AP) endonuclease as was recently shown for the M. luteus enzyme. The pyrimidine dimer DNA-glycosylase activity of both enzymes is more active on double-stranded DNA than it is on single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1581288183,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor has been solubilized from bovine adrenocortical membranes with octyl-beta-D-glucoside and purified 350-fold in the presence of the detergent. The activity of the solubilized receptor was assayed by precipitating the receptor with acetone in the presence of egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes. the receptor-phosphatidylcholine liposomes bound 125I-LDL with the same affinity and specificity as did the native LDL receptor of intact membranes. The complex of receptor and octylglucoside had a Stokes radius of 53.5 A as determined by agarose gel filtration. The sedimentation coefficient, s20,w, of the receptor . octylglucoside complex was 7.3 as determined by metrizamide density gradient centrifugation. An identical value for the sedimentation coefficient was obtained when deuterium oxide was substituted for water in the metrizamide gradient. These data were used to derive an estimate of 163,000 for the molecular weight of the LDL receptor . octylglucoside complex (range of molecular weight, 152,000 to 170,000). The receptor is an acidic protein as determined by its behavior on ion exchange chromatography. In the most highly purified LDL receptor preparation, which had been subjected to the sequential steps of solubilization, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, agarose gel filtration, and phosphatidylcholine/acetone precipitation, the receptor was estimated to constitute about 5% of the total protein. Thus, complete purification of the LDL receptor from bovine adrenocortical membranes will require an additional 20-fold purification, or a total purification of about 7,000-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1570767037,"Purified polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase degraded native human liver type III collagen at 27 degrees C by making a cleavage through the triple helix. The enzyme had no effect on human type I collagen. The reaction was inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PhCH2SO2F) but not by EDTA. The collagen reaction products were identical with those generated by human rheumatoid synovial collagenase when analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. NH2-trminal sequence analysis indicated that the enzyme cleaved at an isoleucyl-threonyl bond located 4 residues on the carboxyl side of the established cleavage site for animal collagenases. Therefore, it is likely that in pathologic states, type III collagen can be selectively depleted from the matrix by this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1503740541,"Two classes of high affinity, cGMP-specific binding sites have been found in association with a peripheral membrane protein in rod outer segments. [3H]cGMP and a photoaffinity label, 8-N3-[32P]cIMP, have been used to study these cGMP binding sites. The cGMP binding sites co-migrated with rod outer segment phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17) upon Bio-Gel A-0.5m column chromatography, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and isoelectric focusing (pI 5.35). Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the 8-N3-[32P]cIMP-labeled protein also migrated in a position identical with that of purified phosphodiesterase. Scatchard analysis, using purified phosphodiesterase, revealed the presence of two classes of cGMP binding sites with apparent KD values of 0.16 and 0.83 microM. A number of observations indicated that these high affinity, cGMP-specific binding sites are distinct from the phosphodiesterase catalytic site. cAMP, which is a substrate for phosphodiesterase, did not bind to the high affinity cGMP specific sites. Limited tryptic proteolysis of phosphodiesterase resulted in a striking activation of the catalytic activity and a 96% loss of cGMP binding. 1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine inhibited phosphodiesterase activity and enhanced the specific binding of cGMP. Mg2+ was necessary for phosphodiesterase activity, but not for high affinity cGMP binding. Finally, phosphodiesterase activity and the cGMP-specific high affinity sites showed different stabilities on storage in phosphate buffer. These specific high affinity cGMP binding sites may be involved in the regulation of phosphodiesterase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1489272732,"Leukotriene A, an unstable intermediate in the conversion of arachidonic acid to stable leukotrienes, was isolated from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The allylic epoxide intermediate is rapidly hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. A method was therefore developed for esterification and extraction of the intermediate as the methyl ester from an alkaline aqueous phase, into an aprotic solvent. This was achieved by addition of methanol and an excess of diazomethane in ether to the incubatio mixture, followed by addition of water, and phase separation. The identity of the isolated compound with the previously synthesized methyl ester of 5 (S)-trans-5,6-oxido-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicostatetraenoic acid (leukotriene A), was established by comparing chromatographic and chemical properties of the isolated compound and synthetic leukotriene A."
https://openalex.org/W1532109734,"A core-associated enzyme, which catalyzes a nucleotide-pyrophosphate exchange with GTP, has been purified from vaccinia virions. The enzyme requires MgCl2 for activity, has an alkaline pH optimum, and specifically utilizes GTP as the exchanging nucleotide. The enzyme does not catalyze exchange of GMP with GTP. The GTP-PPi exchange enzyme co-purifies with vaccinia capping enzyme (RNA guanylyltransferase and RNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase) through successive chromatography steps on DEAE-cellulose, DNA-cellulose, and phosphocellulose. GTP-PPi exchange and capping activities remain physically associated during sedimentation in a glycerol gradient. Under high salt conditions (1 M NaCl), GTP-PPi exchange, capping, and methylating activities co-sediment with an RNA triphosphatase activity and a nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activity as a 6.5 S multifunctional enzyme complex which contains two major polypeptides of 96,000 and 26,000 molecular weight. The characteristics of the various enzymatic reactions catalyzed by this complex are described. The GTP-PPi exchange reaction of vaccinia guanylyltransferase affords a simple, sensitive assay for capping enzyme function. The relevance of the GTP-PPi exchange reaction to the mechanism of transguanylylation is considered."
https://openalex.org/W2090900962,"We describe the isolation and characterization of clonal variants of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells which have been selected for loss of response to nerve growth factor (NGF). PC12 cells mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate were cultured in the presence of NGF, causing normal cells to cease proliferation and allowing the isolation of cell clones which do not show growth inhibition by NGF. Some but not all of these clones also failed to respond morphologically to NGF. Forty clones were isolated and characterized. Many exhibited altered morphologies of a variety of types, including clones with an NGF-independent formation of neurites and clones with various types of flattened epithelial morphology. Variant clones appeared to be mutants since their frequency of occurrence was increased by mutagen, the clones were generally phenotypically stable and no alteration in chromosomal composition was observed. Three clones lacked NGF receptor. Some clones responded morphologically to NGF (by forming neurites) without inhibition of proliferation. Several clones which did not otherwise respond to NGF nevertheless responded with transient membrane ruffling. Thus transient changes in cell surface morphology caused by NGF binding do not necessarily lead to subsequent responses. Several alternative hypotheses concerning the nature of the mutations induced are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1573741209,"Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation was studied in intact hamster insulinoma cells. Depolarizing concentrations of potassium which stimulate Ca2+ uptake and insulin release by these cells also increased phosphorylation of one peptide, Mr = 60,000 (P60). This was demonstrated by incubating 32P-labeled insulinoma cells in media containing 50 mM K+ followed by analysis of the cellular proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Potassium-induced phosphorylation of P60 was nearly half-maximal after 1 min and reached a plateau by 10 min. The enhanced 32P-labeling of P60 observed in the presence of 50 mM K+ was Ca2+-dependent since omission of extracellular Ca2+ or addition of the Ca2+ channel blocker alpha-isopropyl-alpha-[(N-methyl-N-homoveratryl)-gamma-aminopropyl]3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetonitrile hydrochloride prevented the effect. Glucagon (3 microM), which stimulates insulin release in a cAMP-dependent manner, had no effect on P60 phosphorylation. A possible involvement of calmodulin was explored in studies using trifluoperazine. The Ca2+-dependent increase in phosphorylation of P60 was prevented by trifluoperazine. Moreover, Ca2+ influx-mediated insulin release and P60 phosphorylation were inhibited at nearly identical concentrations of trifluoperazine. Half-maximal inhibition of potassium-induced insulin release and P60 phosphorylation was seen at 2.6 microM and 2.5 microM trifluoperazine, respectively. The data are consistent with a sequence of events involving Ca2+ influx, phosphorylation of P60 by a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and resultant insulin secretion."

The relative frequencies of initiations at these three origins are different from those found in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1588334665,"The proteolytic removal of about 60 amino acids from the COOH terminus of the bacteriophage T4 helix-destabilizing protein (gene 32 protein) produces 32*I, a 27,000-dalton fragment which still binds tightly and cooperatively to single-stranded DNA. The substitution of 32*I protein for intact 32 protein in the seven-protein T4 replication complex results in dramatic changes in some of the reactions catalyzed by this in vitro DNA replication system, while leaving others largely unperturbed. 1. Like intact 32 protein, the 32*I protein promotes DNA synthesis by the DNA polymerase when the T4 polymerase accessory proteins (gene 44/62 and 45 proteins) are also present. The host helix-destabilizing protein (Escherichia coli ssb protein) cannot replace the 32I protein for this synthesis. 2. Unlike intact 32 protein, 32*I protein strongly inhibits DNA synthesis catalyzed by the T4 DNA polymerase alone on a primed single-stranded DNA template. 3. Unlike intact 32 protein, the 32*I protein strongly inhibits RNA primer synthesis catalyzed by the T4 gene 41 and 61 proteins and also reduces the efficiency of RNA primer utilization. As a result, de novo DNA chain starts are blocked completely in the complete T4 replication system, and no lagging strand DNA synthesis occurs. 4. The 32*I protein does not bind to either the T4 DNA polymerase or to the T4 gene 61 protein in the absence of DNA; these associations (detected with intact 32 protein) would therefore appear to be essential for the normal control of 32 protein activity, and to account at least in part for observations 2 and 3, above. We propose that the COOH-terminal domain of intact 32 protein functions to guide its interactions with the T4 DNA polymerase and the T4 gene 61 RNA-priming protein. When this domain is removed, as in 32*I protein, the helix destabilization induced by the protein is controlled inadequately, so that polymerizing enzymes tend to be displaced from the growing 3'-OH end of a polynucleotide chain and are thereby inhibited. Eukaryotic helix-destabilizing proteins may also have similar functional domains essential for the control of their activities."
https://openalex.org/W1499803760,"It has been shown previously (Polisky, B., Green, P., Garfin, D. E., McCarthy, B. J., Goodman, H. M., and Boyer, H. W. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 72, 3310-3314; Hsu, M., and Berg, P. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 131-138) that the cleavage sequence specificity of Eco RI endonuclease can be relaxed by various means. In this paper this phenomenon is explored in detail, in order to obtain further insight into the nature and selectivity of sequence recognition patterns between proteins and double-stranded nucleic acids. Using conditions of low ionic strength and alkaline pH, we have mapped the positions of potentially cleavable sites in the (completely sequenced) replicative form of the bacteriophage phi X174 genome, and have deduced their sequence. The time course of digestion of phi X174 DNA suggests that double-stranded sequences reading GGATTT, AAATTT, GAATTT, and GAATTA (only top strands, written 5' leads to 3', are shown) are cleaved readily under these conditions, while sequences reading CAATTN (N = A, T, G) resist attack. Cleavages at (at least) the more labile sites result in cohesive ends that are religatable. End group analysis of cleaved phi X174 DNA fragments indicates the presence of a 5'-terminal adenine residue on most of the fragments; some fragments may carry a 5'-terminal guanine residue, consistent with the cleavage site sequences suggested above. Addition of Mn2+ to cleavage reactions carried out at moderate salt concentrations and near-neutral pH induces the same pattern of cleavage seen at low ionic strength and alkaline pH. These results are combined with those from other studies, and are interpreted in terms of a model for the site-specific interaction of the Eco RI endonuclease with its substrate, considering both the effects of changes in DNA sequence and of environmental alterations. The resulting model is compared with data developed on similar grounds for Eco RI methylase (see Woodbury, C. P., Downey, R. L., and von Hippel, P. H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11526-11533), and attempts are made to define both common and differing molecular facets of the DNA recognition specificity of these companion (but genetically distinct) enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1547421960,"Replicating molecules of plasmid RSF1040, a deletion mutant of R6K, were synthesized in vitro and analyzed by electron microscopy. Initiation of replication occurs at three unique sites, ori alpha, ori beta, and ori gamma, within a 3900-base pair segment of the R6K genome. These sites are indistinguishable from the origins that are active in vivo. Frequencies of initiation at these three origins, however, are different from those observed in vivo. Replication proceeds unidirectionally in either direction from ori beta and ori gamma and in one direction from ori alpha. The replication terminus of the R6K genome is inactive in the in vitro system."

https://openalex.org/W1528427127,"Abstract An immunological screening technique has been used for the detection of a specific antigen-producing clone in a bank of bacterial colonies containing hybrid plasmids. This technique involves covalent attachment of antiserum to cyanogen bromide-activated paper discs, contact of this paper with lysed colonies on agar plates, and finally detection of the bound antigen with 125I-labeled antibody. Using this method, we have identified an Escherichia coli colony, containing a yeast DNA insert in plasmid ColE1, that produces antigen which combines with antibody directed against purified yeast 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. The hybrid plasmid (pYe57E2) obtained by this procedure has been shown by both biochemical and genetic methods to contain the structural gene PGK for yeast 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. The location of the PGK structural gene on pYe56E2 was determined by immunological screening of E. coli colonies bearing plasmids containing various reconstructions of the original yeast DNA insert. Examination of the expression of the cloned yeast PGK gene in both E. coli and yeast has shown that functional enzyme is synthesized from the cloned gene in yeast, but not in E. coli."

The B cells are like the corticotrophs of the anterior lobe: they stain intensely for adrenocorticotropin and beta-lipotropin but not for alpha-melanotropin. The B cells may account for the high concentration of bioactive adrenocorticotropin measured in the canine pars intermedia, and may explain why in dogs adenomas causing Cushing's disease through hypersecretion of adrenocorticotropin can arise from the intermediate as well as the anterior pituitary lobe."
https://openalex.org/W1573750334,"A mouse helix-destabilizing protein (HD protein-1) has been purified and characterized, and controlled tryptic digestion has been used to generate two large fragments of this protein and to study structural changes accompanying DNA binding. HD protein-1, a DNA-binding protein that has higher affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-cellulose than for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-cellulose and is resistant to a dextran sulfate elution from ssDNA-cellulose, was purified from mouse myeloma by the method described by Herrick and Alberts (Herrick, G., and Alberts, B. M. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 2124-2132). HD protein-1 was heterogeneous with regard to apparent molecular weight (range of Mr = 24,000 to 33,000), but individual Mr species shared extensive primary structure homology as revealed by tryptic peptide mapping. The predominant species of this protein, Mr = 27,000, was resolved from other species and obtained in nearly homogeneous form by preparative isoelectric focusing. Mouse HD protein-1 was capable of lowering the Tm of poly[d(A-T)] by 25 degrees C, indicating that it is a helix-destabilizing protein. Sedimentation boundary analysis revealed that binding to ssDNA was noncooperative and that the binding site covered about 6 nucleotide residues. There was a 35% increase in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein in the presence of ssDNA, suggesting that structural change accompanies binding. Subcellular localization studies indicated that 75% of mouse HD protein-1 is nuclear, but not chromatin-associated, and primary structure analysis indicated that HD protein-1 is distinct from high mobility group proteins 1 and 2, histones, and P8 protein. Tryptic hydrolysis of HD protein-1 produced discrete, large fragments whose apparent molecular weights ranged from 19,000 to 24,000, and whose relative abundance was changed by the presence of ssDNA during the digestion. Thus, a Mr = 22,000 fragment (22 HDP*) predominated in the absence of ssDNA, and a Mr = 19,000, fragment (19 HDP*) predominated in the presence of ssDNA. Poly(dT) and denatured calf thymus DNA were more effective than were other polynucleotides tested in promoting accumulation of 19 HDP*; (dT)8 was as effective as were longer molecules of (dT)n, but (dT)4 and (dT)6 were much less effective, indicating that the binding site involved in 19 HDP* accumulation covered between 6 and 8 residues of (dT)n. Both 19 HDP* and 22 HDP* have the same COOH-terminal end and the same affinity for ssDNA-cellulose as does the native HD protein-1, indicating that a Mr = 8,000 sequence at the NH2-terminal end of HD protein-1 is not required for binding to ssDNA. Even though 22 HDP* retained the ability to bind to ssDNA, it could not be converted to 19 HDP* by further trypsin digestion."

Normal human fibroblasts were shown to specifically bind, internalize, and degrade 125I-labeled Man-6-P-LDL. Specificity for the mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptor was demonstrated by competitive displacement with cold Man-6-P-LDL, Man-6-P, or mannose. No displacement was seen with cold LDL. Kd is estimated to be less than or equal to 2 X 10(-9) M. Degradation of 125I-labeled Man-6-P-LDL in familial hypercholesterolemic fibroblasts showed the same time course and specificity as observed in normal fibroblasts. Man-y-P-LDL was also able to deliver cholesterol to the cytosol where down regulation of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase was observed in both normal and familial hypercholesterolemic fibroblasts.

Over 70-fold overproduction of the protein was obtained with a bacteriophage lambda lysogen carrying the dnaZ gene. The purified protein, under reducing and denaturing conditions, has a molecular weight of 52,000 and appears to be a dimer in its native form. The dnaZ protein is judged to be th 52,000-dalton gamma subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (McHenry, C., and Kornberg, A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6478-6484) for the following reasons: (i) highly purified DNA polymerase III holoenzyme contains a 52,000-dalton polypeptide and has dnaZ-complementing activity; (ii) the 52,000-dalton polypeptide is associated tightly with the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and can be separated from the DNA polymerase III core only with severe measures; (iii) no other purified replication protein, among 14 tested, contains dnaZ protein activity; and (iv) the abundance of dnaZ protein, estimated at about 10 dimer molecules per Escherichia coli cell, is similar to that of the DNA polymerase III core. Among several circular templates tested in vitro (i.e. single stranded phi X174, G4 and M13 DNAs, and duplex phi X174 DNA), all rely on dnaZ protein for elongation by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme.

https://openalex.org/W1599553662,"Low temperature (T less than or equal to 20 K) EPR measurements have revealed the presence of a heretofore undetected signal in uteroferrin, a purple protein bearing a single iron atom per molecule. All three of its principal g values (1.923, 1.738, and 1.583) lie well below the free electron value of 2.0023. Magnetic susceptibility data from 2-77 K confirm that the novel EPR spectrum arises from a paramagnetic center with a single unpaired electron spin. Quantitative correlation of the EPR, susceptibility, and optical data point to chromophoric iron as the source of the rhombic EPR spectrum. Furthermore, close agreement between the concentration of iron and the integrated intensity of the rhombic EPR signal show that the iron in the paramagnetic center is mononuclear. Reduction of the protein to its pink form leaves the rhombic signal essentially unaltered. The previously reported g' = 4.3 EPR signal accounts for only a small fraction of the total iron in the protein and undoubtedly arises from adventitious iron. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that uteroferrin represents a new class of low spin iron proteins."

The enzyme catalyzed incorporation of 1 mol of Pi/mol of light chain in a reaction that was completely dependent upon cAMP and independent of Ca2+. Two-dimensional peptide mapping of alpha-chymotryptic digests, as well as phosphoamino acid analysis of acid hydrolysates, were used to compare the site phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase to that phosphorylated by turkey gizzard myosin light chain kinase. The results indicate that both enzymes phosphorylate the same serine residue. However, the light chains were a better in vitro substrate for myosin light chain kinase than for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The amino acid sequence around the phosphorylated serine is characteristic of substrates of cAMP-dependent protein kinases."

https://openalex.org/W1542771188,"Azari and Phillips (Azari, P., and Phillips, J. L. 1970 Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 138, 32-38) reported that periodate treatment of iron-free ovotransferrin causes a rapid loss of iron-binding activity and an oxidation of 3 to 5 tyrosines and 1 tryptophan. Rapid inactivation and loss of tyrosine in ovotransferrin has been confirmed, and the work extended to human serum transferrin and effects of denaturing concentrations of urea. Extensive (> 80%) inactivations of both ovotransferrin and human serum transferrin were observed when approximately 4 tyrosines were destroyed. Amino acid analysis and 360-MHz 1H NMR spectra confirmed that tyrosines are the only residues rapidly oxidized; the correlation of tyrosine loss with the loss of iron-binding activity suggests strongly that the tyrosines involved are those that function as ligands to metal ions bound to the protein. NMR spectra also showed that periodate oxidation causes local changes of structure in ovotransferrin (presumably at the metal-binding sites) but does not grossly alter the conformation. The addition of 5 to 8 M urea greatly retarded the inactivation and losses of tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1631834785,"Prior studies showed that diphtheria toxin could be separated into ATP-binding and nonbinding fractions (Fractions II and I, respectively) by affinity chromatography on ATP-Sepharose (Lory, S., and Collier, R. J. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 267-271). Here we show that the two fractions also differ in their interactions with NAD. Fraction II bound a single molecule of NAD (Kd about 9 microM) as assayed by flow dialysis or fluorescence quenching and catalyzed both NAD-glycohydrolase and auto-ADP-ribosylation reactions. Fraction I was deficient in NAD-binding and NAD-related reactions. The ratio of the two fractions vried widely among toxin preparations and was independent of the proportion of toxin in the nicked state. Properties of th NAD site on Fraction II were similar to, but not identical with, those of the corresponding site on free Fragment A."

https://openalex.org/W1579877337,"Abstract The oxi3 locus of yeast mitochondrial DNA is currently thought to code for Subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase (Tzagoloff, A., Macino, G., and Sebald, W. (1979) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 48, 419-441). The respiratory competent strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae D273-10B/A48 was used to obtain cytoplasmic petite clones enriched for genetic markers in the oci3 locus. The most complex clone studied (DS6) was ascertained to have a mitochondrial genome with a tandemly repeated segment of mtDNA 16.5 kilobases in length. The oxi3 locus was dissected by mutagenesis of DS6 with ethidium bromide and selection of new clones having less complex genotypes. Six derivative clones with genome sizes ranging from 2.3 to 6.1 kilobases have been extensively analyzed. Most of the restriction sites present in the segments of mtDNA retained by the clones have been mapped, thereby providing a detailed restriction map of the oxi3 gene. Based on the physical locations of the most distal oxi3 mutations, the gene spans approximately 10,000 nucleotides and occupies the region of wild type mtDNA from 44 to 58 map units."

https://openalex.org/W2035209915,"Goat antibodies directed against a subset of the externally oriented plasma membrane glycoproteins of hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells were used to follow the metabolic fate of the membrane antigens and the specifically bound immunoglobulin molecules in this cell type in cultures. Analyses of the immunoprecipitates from cells labeled in situ with neuraminidase and galactose oxidase, followed by reduction with tritiated sodium borohydride, indicate that about 40% of the galactose-labeled plasma membrane glycoproteins are recognized by the antiserum. Fluorescent microscopic analyses of cells treated with fluorescein-conjugated immunoglobulins and analyses of trypsin accessibility indicate that probably all of the antibodies bound to the cell surface are patched and internalized within about 4 hr when the cells are subsequently cultured at 37 degrees C in the presence of rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulins. At the same time, the antigens are also interiorized. Analyses of the cellular localization of the interiorized antigens and antibodies by cell fractionation on Percoll gradients show that the immunoglobulins to the cell surface antigens and the antigens themselves migrate to the same region of the Percoll gradient as lysosomal hydrolases. Although the antibodies bind to the cell surface glycoproteins and bring about patching and interiorization, there is no effect on the degradation of the plasma membrane antigens labeled via the galactose oxidase/borohydride reduction method. Furthermore, the iodinated antibodies directed against these membrane glycoproteins behave in their turnover properties like membrane antigens; the cell-bound specific immunoglobulins have the same half-life as the membrane glycoproteins. When the cells that had been reacted with the goat antibodies to membrane glycoprotein were cultured in the presence of rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulins, degradation of the former antibodies was effectively decreased. Similar results were obtained with concanavalin A and antibodies directed against this plant lectin."
https://openalex.org/W1992597495,"Bursting pacemaker activity in nerve cells can be modified for long periods by synaptic input of short duration. There is evidence that cyclic nucleotides may play a role in these modifications. The predominant effect of elevated levels of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in Aplysia neurons was an increased slope conductance to hyperpolarizing pulses, evident in voltage clamp records. A similar increase in slope conductance was seen as one component of maximum strength synaptic stimulation, which is consistent with the idea that cyclic nucleotides are important in the expression of synaptic alteration of bursting pacemaker activity."
https://openalex.org/W2409354939,"Ltryptophan, to the enzyme greatly facilitated the acidalkaline transition. By titrating the spectral change as a function of pH, the pK values for the acid-alkaline transition were determined to be 8.4 and 9.7 for the rat liver and Pseudomonas enzyme, respectively, in the absence of L-tryptophan. Upon addition of L-tryptophan, however, these pK values shifted to 6.9 and 8.0 for the rat liver and Pseudomonas enzyme, respectively. Thus, the binding of substrate to the enzyme caused a shift in pK values for the acid-alkaline transition by about 1.6 pH units from an alkaline to a neutral region. These pK values as well as the shifts in pK values upon binding of L-tryptophan were confirmed further by measuring the pK from pH dependence curve of midpoint potentials of the heme-iron in the enzymes. By the aid of low temperature spectroscopic techniques, the intensities of low spin bands in the spectra of the alkaline forms were found to increase with concomitant decreases in the high spin bands when the temperature was lowered from a room to liquid nitrogen temperature. Contrariwise, elevation of the temperature increased the high spin components with parallel decreases in the low spin components. These temperature-dependent changes in the spin state were confirmed by an electron paramagnetic and a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Thus, the spin state of the alkaline form of ferric L-tryptophan 2,3dioxygenase is in a thermal spin equilibrium between high and low spin state in either enzymes. The thermodynamic parameters for the spin state change were also described."
https://openalex.org/W1533792396,"The substrate specificity of a preparation of phosphoprotein phosphatase (Mr = 32 000) from rat liver was investigated. Phosphopeptides based on the structure Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val-Ala-Glx-Leu and Ala-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-Ser-Gly-Ser(P)-Val-Tyr-Glu-Pro-Leu-Lys were used. These phosphopeptides correspond to the phosphorylation sites of rat liver pyruvate kinase (type L) and the beta subunit of rabbit muscle phosphorylase b kinase, respectively. A decrease in the apparent Km values and a concomitant increase in Vmax values was observed when the number of amino acyl residues after the phosphoseryl residue in the respective phosphopeptides were increased from 2 to 4, 5, or 6. Most of the phosphopeptides investigated generally showed apparent Km values higher than the values obtained with phosphopyruvate kinase. Ala-Ser(P)-Val-Ala and Gly-Ser(P)-Val-Tyr appeared to be the shortest phosphopeptides that could be dephosphorylated rapidly. These findings support the hypothesis that a small part of the phosphoprotein may be sufficient to fulfill the minimal requirements for its dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1518187199,"the covalent carbohydrate in the toxic lectin ricin has been modified by periodate treatment, and analysis of the products of this reaction indicates that only mannose residues are oxidized. HeLa cell toxicity, cell-surface binding, inhibition of cell-free protein synthesis, and other properties have been investigated as functions of the number of mannose residues modified. The data indicate an important role for mannose in ricin conformation and in the endocytotic process; however, mannose appears not to be essential for binding the toxin to cells."
https://openalex.org/W1599895647,"The binding of the beta nerve growth factor subunit in the 7 S nerve growth factor complex to the two nerve growth factor receptors on chick embryo dorsal root ganglion cells was investigated. Under conditions where the 7 S nerve growth factor complex is maximally stable (in the presence of excess alpha and gamma subunits and of 20 to 30 microM zinc ion), no binding to either receptor was detectable. The time course of the decrease in the binding of beta nerve growth factor to the receptors upon addition of alpha and gamma subunits and zinc ion paralleled the formation of the 7 S complex. Addition of alpha and gamma subunits and zinc ion to the bisdes-arginine118-nerve growth factor, which does not re-form the 7 S complex, failed to inhibit the binding of the derivative to either receptor. While the alpha subunit alone had no effect on beta nerve growth factor binding, the gamma subunit decreased its binding in proportion to the amount of complex formed between these two subunits, suggesting that the beta . gamma complex, like the 7 S complex, does not bind to nerve growth factor receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2045490425,"Abstract Mice of the RF and DBA/2 strains possess endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus (E-MuLV) genomes but express only low to undetectable levels of infectious virus in their lymphoid tissues. F1 mice of this cross showed high levels of infectious E-MuLV if DBA/2 was the maternal parent but very low levels if RF was the maternal parent. E-MuLV expression, if present, was always higher in the spleen than in the thymus. Studies of reciprocal backcross generations with both parental strains indicated that the presence of the virus was governed by a single dominant autosomal locus present in the RF strain, and that RF females, but neither RF males nor DBA/2 females or males, transmitted a non-Mendelian factor which powerfully suppressed virus expression in their progeny. Some but not all (DBA/2♀ × RF♂)F1 females also possessed the capacity to transmit this maternal suppression to their progeny. Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MuLV) showed a different pattern of expression in this cross. In the thymus it was detected in a minority of DBA/2 and in no RF mice; in crosses the presence of X-MuLV in this organ was independent of the presence of E-MuLV. In the spleen, X-MuLV was detected only in a percentage of E-MuLV-positive mice. The maternal factor from RF mothers which suppressed E-MuLV did not suppress thymic expression of X-MuLV. Skin painting with 3-methylcholanthrene induced a high incidence of thymic lymphoma in mice of both parental strains and in F1 hybrids, all of which normally show only low incidences of the diseases; the treatment did not induce markedly increased expression of E-MuLV or X-MuLV in mice of either parental strain, although it did abrogate the diminution of E-MuLV titers seen with age in (DBA/2♀ × RF♂)F1 mice beyond the age of three months."
https://openalex.org/W1552060863,"The role of heme in the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase has been investigated in the mold Neurospora crassa. Iron-deficient cultures of the mold have low levels of cytochrome oxidase and delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase, the latter being the rate-limiting enzyme of the heme-biosynthetic pathway in this organism. Addition of iron to the iron-deficient cultures results in an immediate increase in the levels of delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase followed by an increase in the rate of heme synthesis and cytochrome oxidase levels. The rate of precursor labeling of the mitochondrial subunits of cytochrome oxidase is decreased preferentially under conditions of iron deficiency and addition of iron corrects this picture. Exogenous hemin addition which prevents iron-mediated induction of delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase also inhibits the increase in the activity of cytochrome oxidase and the enhanced precursor labeling of the mitochondrial subunits of cytochrome oxidase. Protein synthesis on mitoribosomes measured in vivo and in vitro is decreased under conditions of heme deficiency. Hemin addition in vitro to mitochondrial lysates prepared from heme-deficient mycelia restores a near normal rate of protein synthesis. It is concluded that heme is required for the optimal rate of translation on mitoribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W277422651,"The adenylate cyclase activation by bovine synthetic parathyroid hormone (bPTH) (1-34) was studied in vitro in kidney plasma membranes from D-deficient (D-Mb) or normal (D+Mb) rats. In D-Mb, the apparent affinity of parathyroid hormone (PTH) for membranes (170 +/- 30 nM) was significantly higher than that measured in D+Mb (55 +/- 5 nM). The maximum velocity of the PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase was significantly higher in D+Mb than in D-Mb (163.0 +/- 13.7 and 93.4 +/- 6.7 pmol of cAMP/mg of protein/min, respectively). The action of vitamin D metabolites on the adenylate cyclase stimulation by PTH was then studied in vitro in D-Mb and D+Mb. In D-Mb, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 24,25-, and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 significantly inhibited cAMP production in the presence of 0.87 microM of bPTH. Vitamin D3 had no effect. Maximal inhibition (86%) was observed for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 decreased the maximum velocity of PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase but did not modify the bPTH apparent affinity for D-Mb. The vitamin D3 metabolites tested did not modify the cyclase stimulation by isoproterenol, sodium fluoride, or 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate. The presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 did not increase the (Na-K)-ATPase or the phosphodiesterase activities. In the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and bPTH, the apparent affinity of ATP for the catalytic moiety was not modified. The maximum velocity was decreased. These results suggest an in vitro interaction between hydroxylated vitamin D metabolites and kidney membranes PTH receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1497840173,"The reactions of both ferric and ferrous horse heart cytochrome c with 2,3-butanedione, pH 7.5, 0.05 M bicarbonate buffer, under a variety of solution conditions, have been examined using amino acid integrity as the primary criterion. The only observable structural alteration was the modification of both the arginyl side chains. The reaction profiles were found to be dependent upon the presence or absence of borate and ascorbate. The single-phased modification of the arginyl side chains in ferrocytochrome c in the absence of borate is rendered biphasic in the presence of borate (borate/reagent ratio of 0.04) through substantial lowering of the rate of reaction of one of the two arginyl side chains. The addition of ascorbate inhibits the reaction in a competitive manner, particularly of the arginyl side chain undergoing rapid modification in its absence. The reactivity of both arginyl side chains to reagent for the ferricytochrome was appreciably larger than for ferrocytochrome c. The addition of reagent to ferricytochrome c also reduces heme iron, which is discerned from the development of a native-like spectrum in the region 500 to 600 nm. The differences in the reactivities of the arginyl side chains to 2,3-butanedione in the two valence states of heme iron are the reflection of small, but definite, conformational differences at the two sites in the two valence states of the protein. The concurrent reduction of heme iron and the modification of the arginyl side chains localizes the reduction and the reaction site for 2,3-butanedione. The inhibition by ascorbate of the reaction of one of the two arginines also identifies the binding domain. Of the two arginines, Arg-38 is suggested to be the ascorbate-binding site."
