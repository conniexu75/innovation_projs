https://openalex.org/W3033219406,"Detection of asymptomatic or subclinical novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and infection potential of COVID-19. To estimate the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in China, we evaluated the host serologic response, measured by the levels of immunoglobulins M and G in 17,368 individuals, in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, and geographic regions in the country, during the period from 9 March 2020 to 10 April 2020. In our cohorts, the seropositivity in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different subcohorts. Seroposivity progressively decreased in other cities as the distance to the epicenter increased. Patients who visited a hospital for maintenance hemodialysis and healthcare workers also had a higher seroprevalence of 3.3% (51 of 1,542, 2.5–4.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI)) and 1.8% (81 of 4,384, 1.5–2.3%, 95% CI), respectively. More studies are needed to determine whether these results are generalizable to other populations and geographic locations, as well as to determine at what rate seroprevalence is increasing with the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Serologic surveillance has the potential to provide a more faithful cumulative viral attack rate for the first season of this novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial results of serological surveillance in China provide valuable data for estimation of the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3033924751,"The view that sleep is essential for survival is supported by the ubiquity of this behavior, the apparent existence of sleep-like states in the earliest animals, and the fact that severe sleep loss can be lethal. The cause of this lethality is unknown. Here we show, using flies and mice, that sleep deprivation leads to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequent oxidative stress, specifically in the gut. ROS are not just correlates of sleep deprivation but drivers of death: their neutralization prevents oxidative stress and allows flies to have a normal lifespan with little to no sleep. The rescue can be achieved with oral antioxidant compounds or with gut-targeted transgenic expression of antioxidant enzymes. We conclude that death upon severe sleep restriction can be caused by oxidative stress, that the gut is central in this process, and that survival without sleep is possible when ROS accumulation is prevented.

Homologous recombination (HR) is a major pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps, and stalled or collapsed replication forks (Kowalczykowski, 2015Kowalczykowski S.C.

HR also provides an alternative pathway for telomere maintenance and ensures proper chromosome segregation during meiosis (Heyer et al., 2010Heyer W.D. Ehmsen K.T. Liu J.

Aberrant HR underlies chromosomal rearrangements often associated with cancer, cancer-prone syndromes, and other genetic diseases (Heyer et al., 2010Heyer W.D. Ehmsen K.T. Liu J.

Mechanism of eukaryotic homologous recombination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). DSB repair in S. cerevisiae is an important paradigm for studying HR (Kowalczykowski, 2015Kowalczykowski S.C. An Overview of the Molecular Mechanisms of Recombinational DNA Repair.Cold Spring Harb.

Mechanisms and regulation of mitotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2014; 198: 795-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). During HR repair, the DNA ends at the break are processed by 5′→3′ strand resection, yielding 3′ ssDNA overhangs that become coated by the heterotrimeric ssDNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA) (Chen and Wold, 2014Chen R. Wold M.S.

RPA is replaced by Rad51 to form the presynaptic complex (PSC) (Heyer et al., 2010Heyer W.D. Ehmsen K.T. Liu J. Regulation of homologous recombination in eukaryotes.Annu. Rev.

Mechanisms and regulation of mitotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2014; 198: 795-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Rad51 is a member of the Rad51/RecA family of DNA recombinases, which form extended helical filaments on ssDNA (Kowalczykowski, 2015Kowalczykowski S.C. An Overview of the Molecular Mechanisms of Recombinational DNA Repair.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7 (a016410)Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These filaments catalyze strand invasion, in which presynaptic ssDNA is paired with a homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) donor template to form a D-loop intermediate that can be shunted through a number of pathways, including DSB repair (DSBR), synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), and break-induced replication (BIR) (Kowalczykowski, 2015Kowalczykowski S.C.

Mechanisms and regulation of mitotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2014; 198: 795-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A central feature of HR is that the damaged DNA must be aligned with a homologous donor dsDNA that can be used as a template to guide repair (Haber, 2018Haber J.E. DNA Repair: The Search for Homology.BioEssays. 2018; 40: e1700229Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This alignment process is referred to as the “homology search” and is conceptually similar to target searches conducted by all other site-specific DNA-binding proteins (Hager et al., 2009Hager G.L. McNally J.G. Misteli T. Transcription dynamics.Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, von Hippel and Berg, 1989von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. Facilitated target location in biological systems.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the homology search can be intuitively understood by recognizing that DNA sequence misalignment will cause loss of genetic information and can give rise to gross chromosomal rearrangements. A major challenge to establishing a comprehensive understanding of the homology search is the transient and highly dynamic nature of the relevant search intermediates (Barzel and Kupiec, 2008Barzel A. Kupiec M. Finding a match: how do homologous sequences get together for recombination?.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, Greene, 2016Greene E.C.

Mechanisms and principles of homology search during recombination.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). An emerging picture of the principles that underlie the homology search includes a combination of 3D intersegmental transfer, short-distance 1D diffusion, and length-dependent homology recognition (Adzuma, 1998Adzuma K. No sliding during homology search by RecA protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31565-31573Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Forget and Kowalczykowski, 2012Forget A.L. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Liu C. Ha T. RecA filament sliding on DNA facilitates homology search.eLife. 2012; 1: e00067Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, these mechanisms are only informative of the basal properties of Rad51/RecA recombinases and do not account for contributions of accessory factors. So, despite recent advances, we still do not have a firm grasp of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to DNA sequence alignment during HR (Barzel and Kupiec, 2008Barzel A. Kupiec M.

Rad54, a member of Swi2/Snf2 family of DNA motor proteins, is a crucial HR factor that promotes strand invasion, catalyzes nucleosome remodeling, and removes Rad51 from dsDNA (Alexeev et al., 2003Alexeev A.

Homology-driven chromatin remodeling by human RAD54.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The importance of Rad54 is underscored by the sensitivity of S. cerevisiae rad54Δ strains and mouse and chicken DT40 RAD54–/– cells to DNA damage and by the association of human RAD54 mutations with breast cancer, colon cancer, lymphoma, and other cancers (Bezzubova et al., 1997Bezzubova O.

Signal. 2013; 6: pl1Crossref PubMed Scopus (8703) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence implicate Rad54 as a participant in the homology search. First, the dsDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of Rad54 is stimulated by Rad51 ssDNA, and second, Rad54 renders dsDNA sensitive to the ssDNA-specific nuclease P1, and this activity is also stimulated by Rad51 ssDNA (Mazin et al., 2000aMazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Rad54 protein is targeted to pairing loci by the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Van Komen et al., 2000Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Superhelicity-driven homologous DNA pairing by yeast recombination factors Rad51 and Rad54.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar); both effects are independent of DNA sequence homology, implying that Rad54 acts prior to homology recognition. Third, the early stages of HR coincide with a Rad54-dependent increase in chromosome mobility, which may reflect long-range DNA movements during the homology search (Lisby and Rothstein, 2015Lisby M. Rothstein R. Cell biology of mitotic recombination.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a016535Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fourth, Rad54 promotes co-association of a heterologous template with the PSC (Tavares et al., 2019Tavares E.M. Wright W.D. Heyer W.D. Le Cam E. Dupaigne P. In vitro role of Rad54 in Rad51-ssDNA filament-dependent homology search and synaptic complexes formation.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Finally, deletion of RAD54 disrupts the homology search in vivo, as evidenced by a reduced ability of the Rad51 PSC to scan chromosomes for homology in budding yeast strains that lack a homologous donor (Renkawitz et al., 2013Renkawitz J. Lademann C.A. Kalocsay M. Jentsch S. Monitoring homology search during DNA double-strand break repair in vivo.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, there is as yet no definitive description of the potential mechanistic role(s) of Rad54 in the homology search. To address the role of Rad54 in the homology search, we developed a DNA curtain assay for visualizing search intermediates at the single-molecule level. Our results show that Rad54 reduces the dimensionality of the search by acting as a molecular motor to drive rapid ATP-dependent translocation of the PSC along the donor dsDNA. We show that the motor activity of Rad54 is coupled to transient perturbation of the donor dsDNA, consistent with formation of a bubble or underwound structure, which enables the ssDNA-binding protein RPA to track with the PSC during the homology search. Furthermore, we show that RPA dramatically affects homology recognition efficiency and enables simultaneous surveillance of both strands of the donor dsDNA. Altogether, our findings reveal that Rad54 fundamentally alters the homology search mechanism from a passive diffusion-based mechanism characteristic of the basal HR machinery to an active ATP-dependent molecular motor-based mechanism in which the PSC actively scans duplex DNA for potential sequence homology. We developed a DNA curtain assay for visualizing the homology search using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Figure 1A). We tested unlabeled S. cerevisiae Rad54 or GFP-tagged Rad54, which retains ATPase activity, binds tightly to the PSC (Crickard et al., 2018Crickard J.B. Kaniecki K. Kwon Y. Sung P. Lisby M. Greene E.C. Regulation of Hed1 and Rad54 binding during maturation of the meiosis-specific presynaptic complex.EMBO J. 2018; 37: e98728Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), is targeted to DNA repair foci in vivo, and complements a rad54Δ strain (Lisby et al., 2004Lisby M.

Choreography of the DNA damage response: spatiotemporal relationships among checkpoint and repair proteins.Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Rad54 greatly stimulates formation of D-loop products by Rad51 (Mazin et al., 2000aMazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Rad54 protein is targeted to pairing loci by the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament.Mol.

Biochemical D-loop assays using an Atto647N-labeled tailed duplex DNA fragment containing a 21-nt ssDNA 3′ overhang and 56 bp of dsDNA for assembly of the PSC (Figure 1B) showed that GFP-Rad54 strongly stimulated the D-loop reaction (Figure S1A). Biochemical assays also confirmed that the ATPase activity of GFP-Rad54 is stimulated by Rad51 ssDNA (Figures S1B–S1D). These results provide assurance that GFP-Rad54 possesses the biochemical functions of the untagged protein.Figure S1Biochemical Characteristics of GFP-Rad54, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Gel–based assay showing bulk biochemical strand invasion reactions performed with Rad54 or GFP–Rad54 in assays with the tailed duplex substrate that has a 21–nt ssDNA overhang that is fully homologous to a specific the plasmid; unless stated otherwise, this is the same substrate that is used in the single molecule assays.

To visualize the homology search, we generated a CURMID (curtains plasmid; 12,273 kb, ∼4.2 μm) substrate comprised of a pUC19 plasmid with an added 9.5-kb fragment of λ-phage DNA (Figure 1A). For DNA curtain assays, the linearized CURMID was labeled at one end with biotin and at the other end with digoxigenin (DIG). The labeled DNA was then aligned and anchored on the sample chamber surface (Greene et al., 2010Greene E.C. Wind S. Fazio T. Gorman J. Visnapuu M.L. DNA curtains for high-throughput single-molecule optical imaging.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 472: 293-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PSCs prepared with an Atto565-labeled DNA (Figure 1B) were monitored as they interacted with donor dsDNA (Figure 1C); this Atto565-labeled DNA is identical to that used in Figure S1B and is homologous to a specific site in the anchored CURMID DNA (see below). Unless stated otherwise, all subsequent assays with the 21-nt tailed duplex correspond to this substrate. These assays revealed extensive Rad51-dependent co-localization of GFP-Rad54 and the Atto565-labeled DNA on the donor dsDNA (93% co-localization, N = 196; Figure S1E). Control reactions lacking Rad51 or GFP-Rad54 exhibited little or no binding of the PSCs to the donor dsDNA (Figure S1F), consistent with the stringent requirement for Rad54 in bulk biochemical assays for D-loop formation with S. cerevisiae Rad51 (Ceballos and Heyer, 2011Ceballos S.J.

No evidence of translocation was observed for the ATP hydrolysis-deficient Rad54-K341R mutant (Figure 1D). Analysis of the translocation data yielded an average PSC velocity of 151 ± 75 bp s–1 (N = 636; Figure 1E) and an average processivity of 5.2 ± 1.9 kb (N = 483; Figure 1F); comparable results were obtained with either GFP-Rad54 or unlabeled Rad54 (Figure S2A). Translocation velocity increased to 302 ± 172 (N = 187), 477 ± 266 (N = 202), and 592 ± 421 (N = 105) for PSCs prepared with longer 90-, 150-, and 1,000-nt ssDNA substrates, respectively (Figures 1G and S2B–S2D). The increased velocity observed for substrates with longer lengths did not coincide with an increased rate of ATP hydrolysis by Rad54 in bulk biochemical assays (Figure S2E), suggesting that the longer PSCs may somehow allow Rad54 to more efficiently couple ATP hydrolysis to translocation along the donor dsDNA. Importantly, Rad51 alone does not allow 1D movement of the presynaptic ssDNA relative to the donor dsDNA (Lee et al., 2015Lee J.Y. Terakawa T. Qi Z. Steinfeld J.B. Redding S. Kwon Y. Gaines W.A.

This conclusion is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that Rad54 and its paralog Rdh54 are ATP-dependent dsDNA motor proteins (Amitani et al., 2006Amitani I. Baskin R.J.

Our findings show that Rad54 co-localizes with the PSC and promotes rapid ATP-dependent translocation of the PSC along the donor dsDNA. If the 1D movement represented behavior of bona fide search intermediates, then the PSCs should become arrested upon encountering homology in the donor dsDNA molecule. We tested this prediction using substrates that were homologous to one of two different regions on the donor dsDNA (Figure 2A). TIRF microscopy images and binding distribution histograms revealed PSC accumulation at the target sites on the donor dsDNA (Figures 2B, 2C, and S3A–S3D) whereas PSCs prepared with Rad54-K341R did not (Figure 2D). These results suggested that PSC translocation leads to homology recognition.Figure S3Target Recognition Is Dictated by Sequence Homology, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Wide–field images showing PSCs [unlabeled Rad51, GFP–Rad54 (green) and Atto565–DNA (magenta)] bound at target position 4.5.

https://openalex.org/W3034170934,"Every decision we make is accompanied by a sense of confidence about its likely outcome. This sense informs subsequent behavior, such as investing more—whether time, effort, or money—when reward is more certain. A neural representation of confidence should originate from a statistical computation and predict confidence-guided behavior. An additional requirement for confidence representations to support metacognition is abstraction: they should emerge irrespective of the source of information and inform multiple confidence-guided behaviors. It is unknown whether neural confidence signals meet these criteria. Here, we show that single orbitofrontal cortex neurons in rats encode statistical decision confidence irrespective of the sensory modality, olfactory or auditory, used to make a choice. The activity of these neurons also predicts two confidence-guided behaviors: trial-by-trial time investment and cross-trial choice strategy updating. Orbitofrontal cortex thus represents decision confidence consistent with a metacognitive process that is useful for mediating confidence-guided economic decisions."

The fusion of the maternal and paternal gametes triggers a remarkable transition from two fully differentiated cells to a totipotent zygote that gives rise to all tissues during embryogenesis. In flies, the development of the embryo during the first 13 synchronized nuclear divisions relies on maternally provided proteins and transcripts. These maternal elements are replaced by newly synthesized ones during the major wave of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) at the nuclear cycle (nc) 14 at embryonic stage (st) 5 when the zygotic genome has reformed to accommodate the transcriptional active status (Lefebvre and Lécuyer, 2018Lefebvre F.A.

Increase in nucleosome accessibility as well as gradual enrichment of RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) are observed from nc11 (Blythe and Wieschaus, 2015Blythe S.A. Wieschaus E.F.

The repressive mark H3K27me3 is inherited from the maternal germline restricting the activation of developmental genes (Zenk et al., 2017Zenk F. Loeser E. Schiavo R. Kilpert F. Bogdanović O.

The few transcripts that are activated before ZGA (during the minor zygotic wave) are under the control of the pioneer transcription factor Zelda, which mediates local chromatin accessibility (Harrison et al., 2011Harrison M.M.

However, the mechanisms that guide the reprogramming of the entire genome are not fully understood. Acetylation of histone tails is known to promote transcriptional activation (Barnes et al., 2019Barnes C.E. English D.M. Cowley S.M.

Tsai L.H. Histone acetylation: molecular mnemonics on the chromatin.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Among the histone modifications positively correlated with transcription activation, H4K16ac is unique because it prevents chromatin compaction in vitro (Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006Shogren-Knaak M. Ishii H. Sun J.-M. Pazin M.J. Davie J.R. Peterson C.L. Histone H4-K16 acetylation controls chromatin structure and protein interactions.Science. 2006; 311: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). However, the developmental dynamics and the biological significance of this modification in the embryonic genome prior to ZGA remain unclear. H4K16ac is deposited by the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) males absent on the first (MOF) (Akhtar and Becker, 2001Akhtar A. Becker P.B.

Biol. 2005; 25: 9175-9188Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The MOF-containing male-specific lethal (MSL) complex is responsible for chromosome-wide upregulation of the male X chromosome to equalize its expression to the female X as well as to autosomal genes (Gelbart et al., 2009Gelbart M.E. Larschan E. Peng S. Park P.J. Kuroda M.I. Drosophila MSL complex globally acetylates H4K16 on the male X chromosome for dosage compensation.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Genome-wide analysis reveals MOF as a key regulator of dosage compensation and gene expression in Drosophila.Cell. 2008; 133: 813-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The complex consists of five proteins (MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MOF, and MLE) together with two long non-coding RNAs, RNA on the X 1 and 2 (roX1, roX2), and is capable of specifically recognizing the single male X chromosome (Samata and Akhtar, 2018Samata M. Akhtar A. Dosage Compensation of the X Chromosome: A Complex Epigenetic Assignment Involving Chromatin Regulators and Long Noncoding RNAs.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all MSL proteins, apart from MSL2, are maternally deposited as transcripts (Lott et al., 2011Lott S.E. Villalta J.E. Schroth G.P. Luo S. Tonkin L.A. Eisen M.B. Noncanonical compensation of zygotic X transcription in early Drosophila melanogaster development revealed through single-embryo RNA-seq.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1000590Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and proteins, which remain stable through the early embryonic stages (Rastelli et al., 1995Rastelli L. Richman R. Kuroda M.I. The dosage compensation regulators MLE, MSL-1 and MSL-2 are interdependent since early embryogenesis in Drosophila.Mech. Dev. 1995; 53: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined whether they form a functional complex. Here, by analyzing precisely staged Drosophila embryos before and after ZGA and by performing genetic and genomic experiments, we show that H4K16ac is intergenerationally transmitted from the female germline and has a fundamental role in controlling chromatin accessibility in the absence of ongoing transcription during early embryogenesis. Furthermore, it poises promoters for future gene activation. We set out to investigate H4K16ac deposition during gametogenesis. Immunostaining of Drosophila ovaries revealed that H4K16ac is abundant in the nuclei of developing and mature oocytes (Figures 1A and S1D) but absent from late spermatids (Figures 1B and S1A). We verified the specificity of the H4K16ac oocyte signal by germline depletion of MOF via RNAi (Figures 1A and S1B). To address whether MOF-mediated maternal H4K16ac deposition relies on the MSL complex, we depleted MSL3 from the maternal pool (Figures S1B and S1C). Consistent with the role of MSL3 in enhancing MOF catalytic activity in somatic cells (Buscaino et al., 2003Buscaino A. Köcher T. Kind J.H. Holz H. Taipale M. Wagner K. Wilm M. Akhtar A.

Because the mature oocyte is transcriptionally inactive, observing a robust signal for H4K16ac was unexpected. It prompted us to test whether the H4K16ac signal is propagated to the progeny and to this end we performed immunostaining of fertilized eggs 0–30 min after egg laying (AEL) to capture the time of fertilization (Figure 1C). The maternal pronucleus, through which H3K27me3 is inherited to the progeny, was previously reported to be devoid of histone acetylation (Loppin et al., 2015Loppin B. Dubruille R. Horard B. The intimate genetics of Drosophila fertilization.Open Biol. 2015; 5: 150076Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Sobel et al., 1995Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D.

Germ line-inherited H3K27me3 restricts enhancer function during maternal-to-zygotic transition.Science. 2017; 357: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). H4K5ac and H4K12ac get deposited de novo on the paternal pronucleus at fertilization during the replacement of protamines with histones (Loppin et al., 2015Loppin B. Dubruille R. Horard B. The intimate genetics of Drosophila fertilization.Open Biol. 2015; 5: 150076Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Sobel et al., 1995Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Conservation of deposition-related acetylation sites in newly synthesized histones H3 and H4.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we detected H4K16ac on both maternal and paternal pronuclei during oocyte meiosis II (Figure 1C) and apposition of the parental pronuclei (Figures 1D and S1F). Given the absence of bulk H4K16ac signal in late stages of spermatogenesis, the deposition of H4K16ac on the paternal pronucleus must happen de novo upon fertilization. De novo acetylation of H4K8 was also detected on the paternal pronucleus; however, it remained absent from the maternal pronucleus (Figure 1E). Furthermore, H4K16ac was retained on all chromosomes throughout the first (Figure 1F) and subsequent zygotic divisions (Figure S2A). These data show that H4K16ac is intergenerationally maintained throughout early embryogenesis via its continuous association with both meiotic and mitotic chromosomes. We next asked whether H4K16ac presence in oocytes is evolutionarily conserved. Indeed, we observed H4K16ac enrichment in oocytes of two distant fly species, Drosophila virilis and Drosophila busckii, separated from Drosophila melanogaster by 40 million years of evolution (Figure 1G). Next, we characterized whether H4K16ac is present on the maternal germline in mammals. We analyzed different stages of mouse oogenesis (oocytes in primary, secondary, and antral follicles; Figures S1G and S1H), haploid metaphase I and II (MI and MII) oocytes (Figure 1H) as well as mouse zygotes upon fertilization and at the 2-cell stage (Figure 1I). Similar to flies, we observed that H4K16ac is enriched on chromatin during mitosis and meiosis and throughout oogenesis and early mouse development in the absence of active transcription, indicating a conserved function. H4K16ac was also abundantly detectable in early developing embryos prior to ZGA (Figures 2A–C and S2A) and its levels were sensitive to germline depletion of MOF and MSL3 (Figures 2C and S2B), whereas the bulk levels of H4K8ac or H4K12ac were unaffected (Figures 2D and S2C). Given that MOF and MSL3 functionally interact in the deposition of H4K16ac, we tested whether they reside in the same protein complex. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the presence of an MSL sub-complex consisting of MOF, MSL3, and MSL1 in female ovaries and in 0–1.5 h embryos (maternal MSL sub-complex; Figures 2E, S2D, and S2E). MSL2 is absent from ovaries and early embryos and is only expressed in males following ZGA (Figures 2F, bottom, and S2F) (Bashaw and Baker, 1995Bashaw G.J. Baker B.S.

We next performed immunostaining of MOF and MSL2 before and after ZGA to assess the chromatin association of the maternal and canonical MSL (sub)complexes. MOF was robustly detected on all chromosomes before ZGA at st4 (Figure 2F). A diffuse X chromosome territory formed by MSL2 was first detectable at st5 in male embryos. In contrast, MOF accumulation on the male X chromosome was slower, only beginning at st6 and maturing at st7 (Figure 2F). This pattern of X chromosome territory formation coincides with roX RNA expression: roX1 is expressed at st3–4, while roX2 shows slower kinetics (Lott et al., 2011Lott S.E. Villalta J.E. Schroth G.P.

These findings suggest that H4K16ac deposition by the maternal MSL sub-complex precedes the onset of major embryonic transcriptional activation and the onset of X chromosome dosage compensation. We performed a systematic evaluation of the genomic localization of H4K16ac by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis using MNase-digested chromatin derived from hand-staged embryos. Genome-wide profiles were generated from preblastoderm (st3–4, prior to ZGA), blastoderm (st5, ZGA), gastrulating (st7), and older embryos (14–16 h AEL, st15; Figures 3A and S3A). Peak-calling analysis identified approximately 7,000 H4K16ac-positive promoters (Figures 3B and 3C), the majority of which remained marked by H4K16ac throughout development (Figures 3C, right, and 3E; example snapshots can be seen in Figure 3D). We next compared the H4K16ac signal to other promoter-associated histone modifications (Figures 3E and S3B–S3D). In contrast to H3K36me3 and H3K4me3, H4K16ac was enriched on promoters before the major wave of transcription (Figure 3E). Furthermore, consistent with the localization of MOF (Figure 2F), bulk enrichment of H4K16ac on the male X chromosome was only scored from st7 onwards (Figures 3C, left, 3E, and S3C, cluster 1), hinting towards a genome-wide function that is not restricted to dosage compensation.Figure S3H4K16ac Enrichment at Promoters Regulates Nucleosome Accessibility in Preblastoderm Embryos, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Digestion pattern of sequencing libraries used for histone modifications and Pol II MNase ChIP-seq.

The presence of H4K16ac prior to ZGA prompted us to address whether it may have a chromatin architectural role rather than a role in directly modulating transcription. We used maternal depletion of MOF to mediate H4K16ac loss in early embryonic stages and analyzed local nucleosome accessibility using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq; Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D.

Remarkably, we observed that maternal depletion of MOF resulted in a global decrease of nucleosome accessibility in st3–4 embryos (Figures 3F and 3G). Furthermore, maternal msl-3 RNAi phenocopied MOF loss on global nucleosome accessibility as well as on MOF-sensitive ATAC-seq peaks during st5 (Figures 3F and 3H). The majority of MOF-sensitive ATAC-seq peaks were located within H4K16ac-positive genes (Figures 3G and S3E) and consisted primarily of DNA binding sites for several developmental regulators as well as GAGA factor (Figure S3F). Therefore, H4K16ac at promoters ensures establishment of global open nucleosome conformation in vivo preceding the onset of the major zygotic genome activation. Many of the H4K16ac-positive genes were distributed within large domains spanning 50 kb of average length (Figures 4A and S4A–S4C). Because H4K16ac loss resulted in bulk loss of chromatin accessibility, we next addressed the potential impact of the H4K16ac domains on 3D chromosome conformation. The main topological structures—namely topologically associated domains (TADs)—emerge during the preblastoderm stages, whereas the organization of the genome into active and inactive compartments (A and B respectively) begins at st5 (Hug et al., 2017Hug C.B.

Changes in the physiological characteristics, proteome, and specific metabolites investigated on molecular and cellular functions were studied in two soybean cultivars exposed to different heat and water stress conditions independently and in combination. Leaf protein composition was studied using 2-DE and complemented with MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. While the two cultivars displayed genetic variation in response to water and heat stress, thirty-nine proteins were significantly altered in their relative abundance in response to WS, HS and combined WS+HS in both cultivars. A majority of these proteins were involved in metabolism, response to heat and photosynthesis showing significant cross-tolerance mechanisms. This study revealed that MED37C, a probable mediator of RNA polymerase transcription II protein, has potential interacting partners in Arabidopsis and signified the marked impact of this on the PI-471938 cultivar. Elevated activities in antioxidant enzymes indicate that the PI-471938 cultivar can restore the oxidation levels and sustain the plant during the stress. The discovery of this plant’s development of cross-stress tolerance could be used as a guide to foster ongoing genetic modifications in stress tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3033515365,"Starting renal replacement therapy (RRT) for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at an optimal time, either with hemodialysis or kidney transplantation, is crucial for patient’s well-being and for successful management of the condition. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of creating forecasting models to predict the onset of RRT 3, 6, and 12 months from the time of the patient’s first diagnosis with CKD, using only the comorbidities data from National Health Insurance from Taiwan. The goal of this study was to see whether a limited amount of data (including comorbidities but not considering laboratory values which are expensive to obtain in low- and medium-income countries) can provide a good basis for such predictive models. On the other hand, in developed countries, such models could allow policy-makers better planning and allocation of resources for treatment. Using data from 8,492 patients, we obtained the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.773 for predicting RRT within 12 months from the time of CKD diagnosis. The results also show that there is no additional advantage in focusing only on patients with diabetes in terms of prediction performance. Although these results are not as such suitable for adoption into clinical practice, the study provides a strong basis and a variety of approaches for future studies of forecasting models in healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W3033231739,"Extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) is a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expressing neutrophils produce excessive amounts of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We reveal that eCIRP generates ICAM-1+ neutrophils through triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) and the ICAM-1+ neutrophils involve Rho GTPase to promote NETosis. Treatment of BMDN with rmCIRP increased the frequency of ICAM-1+ BMDN, while rmCIRP-treated TREM-1-/- BMDN or pretreatment of BMDN with TREM-1 inhibitor LP17 significantly decreased the frequency of ICAM-1+ neutrophils. The frequencies of ICAM-1+ neutrophils in blood and lungs were markedly decreased in rmCIRP-injected mice or septic mice treated with LP17. Coculture of ICAM-1-/- neutrophils or wild-type (WT) neutrophils with WT macrophages in the presence of a peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) inhibitor reduced TNF-α and IL-6 compared to WT neutrophils treated with rmCIRP. Treatment of ICAM-1-/- neutrophils with rmCIRP resulted in reduced quantities of NETs compared to WT rmCIRP-treated neutrophils. Treatment of BMDN with rmCIRP-induced Rho activation, while blockade of ICAM-1 significantly decreased Rho activation. Inhibition of Rho significantly decreased rmCIRP-induced NET formation in BMDN. TREM-1 plays a critical role in the eCIRP-mediated increase of ICAM-1 expression in neutrophils, leading to the increased NET formation via Rho activation to exaggerate inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3033752439,"Dairy intake, as a source of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), has been linked to a lower incidence of type-2-diabetes and increased circulating odd-chain fatty acids (OCFA). To understand this connection, we aimed to investigate differences in BCAA metabolism of leucine and valine, a possible source of OCFA, and their role in hepatic metabolism. Male mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with leucine and valine for 1 week and phenotypically characterized with a focus on lipid metabolism. Mouse primary hepatocytes were treated with the BCAA or a Pparα activator WY-14643 to systematically examine direct hepatic effects and their mechanisms. Here, we show that only valine supplementation was able to increase hepatic and circulating OCFA levels via two pathways; a PPARα-dependent induction of α-oxidation and an increased supply of propionyl-CoA for de novo lipogenesis. Meanwhile, we were able to confirm leucine-mediated effects on the inhibition of food intake and transport of fatty acids, as well as induction of S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation. Taken together, these data illustrate differential roles of the BCAA in lipid metabolism and provide preliminary evidence that exclusively valine contributes to the endogenous formation of OCFA which is important for a better understanding of these metabolites in metabolic health."
https://openalex.org/W3033865029,"Known as a degenerative and progressive dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects about 25 million elderly people around the world. This illness results in a decrease in the productivity of people and places limits on their daily lives. Electroencephalography (EEG), in which the electrical brain activity is recorded in the form of time series and analyzed using signal processing techniques, is a well-known neurophysiological AD biomarker. EEG is noninvasive, low-cost, has a high temporal resolution, and provides valuable information about brain dynamics in AD. Here, we present an original approach based on the use of quantile graphs (QGs) for classifying EEG data. QGs map frequency, amplitude, and correlation characteristics of a time series (such as the EEG data of an AD patient) into the topological features of a network. The five topological network metrics used here—clustering coefficient, mean jump length, betweenness centrality, modularity, and Laplacian Estrada index—showed that the QG model can distinguish healthy subjects from AD patients, with open or closed eyes. The QG method also indicates which channels (corresponding to 19 different locations on the patients’ scalp) provide the best discriminating power. Furthermore, the joint analysis of delta, theta, alpha, and beta wave results indicate that all AD patients under study display clear symptoms of the disease and may have it in its late stage, a diagnosis known a priori and supported by our study. Results presented here attest to the usefulness of the QG method in analyzing complex, nonlinear signals such as those generated from AD patients by EEGs."
https://openalex.org/W3033585965,"Background Behavioral intentions (motivational factors), attitudes, subjective norm (social pressures), and perceived behavioral control promote or discourage smoking behavior among adolescents. Objective To assess students’ behavioral intentions, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on smoking using the Theory of Planned Behavior. The prevalence of smoking among the adolescents is also calculated. Methods In this cross-sectional study, structured self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data from adolescents in primary and secondary schools. Data on demographics, behavioral intentions, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control towards smoking were collected. Pearson product moment correlations and logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with current smoking. Results A total sample of 2554 (mean age = 15; Range = 12–18 years) students participated in the study. Twenty-nine percent (n = 728) of the students had tried smoking at least once. Smoking was predicted by attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intention.There was a strong association between having a parent or guardian, caregiver or close friend who smoked (p < 0.001) and being a smoker. The majority of students (57%) conveyed that adults talked to them about the harmful effects of cigarette smoking and 50% had discussed smoking concerns with their friends. Students who had positive attitudes towards smoking like “smoking makes you confident” were more likely to be current smokers (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.03–2.59). The feeling or conviction that they could refuse a cigarette if offered was an impediment from smoking (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.13–0.26). Conclusions Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control contributed significantly to the students' smoking. Right attitudes must be cultivated and behavioral control must be strengthened for early effective interventions to curtail smoking among adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3033136970,"Bacterial histidine kinases (HKs) are considered attractive drug targets because of their ability to govern adaptive responses coupled with their ubiquity. There are several classes of HK inhibitors; however, they suffer from drug resistance, poor bioavailability, and a lack of selectivity. The 3D structure of Staphylococcus aureus HK was not isolated in high-resolution coordinates, precluding further disclosure of structure-dependent binding to the specific antibiotics. To elucidate structure-dependent binding, the 3D structure of the catalytic domain WalK of S. aureus HK was constructed using homology modeling to investigate the WalK–ligand binding mechanisms through molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies of the waldiomycin and its methyl ester analog were calculated using molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area scoring. The key residues for protein–ligand binding were postulated. The structural divergence responsible for the 7.4-fold higher potency of waldiomycin than that of its ester analog was clearly observed. The optimized 3D macromolecule–ligand binding modes shed light on the S. aureus HK/WalK–ligand interactions that afford a means to assess binding affinity to design new HK/WalK inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3033805136,"Although survivors of sexual violence have shared their stories with the public on social media and mass media platforms in growing numbers, less is known about how general audiences perceive such trauma stories. These perceptions can have profound consequences for survivor mental health. In the present experimental, vignette-based studies, we anticipated that cultural stigma surrounding sexual violence and cultural preference for positive (redemptive) endings to adversity in the United States (U.S.) would shape perceptions. Four samples of U.S. adults (N = 1872) rated first-person narratives of 6 more stigmatizing (i.e., sexual violence) or less stigmatizing (e.g., natural disaster) traumatic events. Confirming pre-registered hypotheses, sexual violence trauma (versus other types of trauma) stories were perceived as more difficult to tell, and their storytellers less likeable, even when they had redemptive endings. Disconfirming other pre-registered hypotheses, redemptive (versus negative) story endings did not boost the perceived likelihood or obligation to share a sexual violence trauma story. Rather, redemptive (versus negative) story endings only boosted the perceived likelihood, obligation, and ease of telling other, less stigmatizing types of trauma stories. Findings suggest that sexual violence survivors do not benefit, to the same degree as other survivors, from telling their stories with the culturally valued narrative template of redemption. Clinical and societal implications of the less receptive climate for sexual violence stories are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3033210749,"Only few data exist in Cambodia on mosquito diversity and their potential role as vectors. Many arboviruses, such as dengue and Japanese encephalitis, are endemic and mostly affect children in the country. This research sets out to evaluate vector relative abundance and diversity in primary schools in Cambodia in an attempt to explain the apparent burden of dengue fever, severe dengue (DEN), Japanese encephalitis (JE), other arboviral diseases and malaria among children, 15 years and under, attending selected primary schools through vector surveys. Entomological surveys were implemented in primary schools in two provinces of Cambodia to assess the potential risk of exposure of schoolchildren to mosquito vector species. Light traps and BG traps were used to collect adult mosquitoes in 24 schools during the rainy and dry seasons of 2017 and 2018 in Kampong Cham and Tboung Khmum provinces. A total of 61 species were described, including Aedes, Culex and Anopheles species. The relative abundance and biodiversity of mosquito species were dependent on the month and school. Of the 37,725 mosquitoes caught during the study, three species accounted for three-quarters of the relative abundance: Culex vishnui, Anopheles indefinitus and Culex quinquefasciatus. More importantly, nearly 90% of the mosquitoes caught in the schools were identified as potential vectors of pathogens including Japanese encephalitis, dengue, and malaria parasites. Our results showed that schools in Cambodia represent a risk for vector-borne disease transmission and highlight the importance of implementing vector control in schools in Cambodia to decrease the risk of transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3034156586,"The neurobiological study of reward was launched by the discovery of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). Subsequent investigation of this phenomenon provided the initial link between reward-seeking behavior and dopaminergic neurotransmission. We re-evaluated this relationship by psychophysical, pharmacological, optogenetic, and computational means. In rats working for direct, optical activation of midbrain dopamine neurons, we varied the strength and opportunity cost of the stimulation and measured time allocation, the proportion of trial time devoted to reward pursuit. We found that the dependence of time allocation on the strength and cost of stimulation was similar formally to that observed when electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle served as the reward. When the stimulation is strong and cheap, the rats devote almost all their time to reward pursuit; time allocation falls off as stimulation strength is decreased and/or its opportunity cost is increased. A 3D plot of time allocation versus stimulation strength and cost produces a surface resembling the corner of a plateau (the “reward mountain”). We show that dopamine-transporter blockade shifts the mountain along both the strength and cost axes in rats working for optical activation of midbrain dopamine neurons. In contrast, the same drug shifted the mountain uniquely along the opportunity-cost axis when rats worked for electrical MFB stimulation in a prior study. Dopamine neurons are an obligatory stage in the dominant model of ICSS, which positions them at a key nexus in the final common path for reward seeking. This model fails to provide a cogent account for the differential effect of dopamine transporter blockade on the reward mountain. Instead, we propose that midbrain dopamine neurons and neurons with non-dopaminergic, MFB axons constitute parallel limbs of brain-reward circuitry that ultimately converge on the final-common path for the evaluation and pursuit of rewards."
https://openalex.org/W3033973282,"Abstract Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are cells within tumors that maintain the ability to self-renew, drive tumor growth, and contribute to therapeutic resistance and cancer recurrence. In this study, we investigate the role of Zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 4 (ZSCAN4) in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The murine Zscan4 is involved in telomere maintenance and genomic stability of mouse embryonic stem cells. Our data indicate that the human ZSCAN4 is enriched for, marks and is co-expressed with CSC markers in HNSCC. We show that transient ZSCAN4 induction for just 2 days increases CSC frequency both in vitro and in vivo and leads to upregulation of pluripotency and CSC factors. Importantly, we define for the first time the role of ZSCAN4 in altering the epigenetic profile and regulating the chromatin state. Our data show that ZSCAN4 leads to a functional histone 3 hyperacetylation at the promoters of OCT3/4 and NANOG, leading to an upregulation of CSC factors. Consistently, ZSCAN4 depletion leads to downregulation of CSC markers, decreased ability to form tumorspheres and severely affects tumor growth. Our study suggests that ZSCAN4 plays an important role in the maintenance of the CSC phenotype, indicating it is a potential therapeutic target in HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W3032917187,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play essential roles in obesity and diabetes. Here, we report a role of Tregs in enhancing β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316243 (CL)-stimulated thermogenic program in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), but not in visceral fat. CL treatment for 7 days increased SAT adipocyte beiging and thermogenic gene expression in male or female mice. Adoptive transfer of Tregs enhanced this CL activity. Such Treg activity lost in male epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and female gonadal gWAT. Adipocyte culture yielded the same conclusion. Tregs enhanced the expression of CL-induced thermogenic genes in SAT from male and female mice. This activity of Tregs reduced or disappeared in adipocytes from eWAT or gWAT. Both CL and Tregs induced much higher UCP-1 (uncoupling protein-1) expression in SAT from females than that from males. A mechanistic study demonstrated a role of Tregs in suppressing the expression of M1 macrophage markers (Tnfa, Il6, iNos, Ip10) and promoting the expression of M2 macrophage markers (Mrc1, Arg1, Il10) in bone-marrow-derived macrophages or in SAT from male or female mice. In female mice with pre-established obesity, Treg adoptive transfer reduced the gWAT weight in 2 weeks. Together with CL treatment, Treg adoptive transfer reduced the SAT weight and further improved CL-induced glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in female obese mice, but did not affect CL-induced body weight loss in male or female obese mice. This study revealed a predominant role of Tregs in female mice in promoting adipocyte beiging and thermogenesis in SAT, in part by slanting M2 macrophage polarization."

Newly discovered oncohistone mutations include lysine-to-methionine substitutions at positions 27 and 36 of histone H3.3. In these instances, the methionine substitution localizes to the active-site pocket of the corresponding histone lysine methyltransferase, thereby inhibiting the respective transmethylation activity. SET domain–containing 3 (SETD3) is a protein (i.e. actin) histidine methyltransferase. Here, we generated an actin variant in which the histidine target of SETD3 was substituted with methionine. As for previously characterized histone SET domain proteins, the methionine substitution substantially (76-fold) increased binding affinity for SETD3 and inhibited SETD3 activity on histidine. Unexpectedly, SETD3 was active on the substituted methionine, generating S-methylmethionine in the context of actin peptide. The ternary structure of SETD3 in complex with the methionine-containing actin peptide at 1.9 Å resolution revealed that the hydrophobic thioether side chain is packed by the aromatic rings of Tyr312 and Trp273, as well as the hydrocarbon side chain of Ile310.

Although the biochemistry of methionine methylation is best characterized in the context of small molecules, the significance of protein methionine methylation is less clear.

We have noted that SETD3 shares a high degree of global similarity with two characterized protein lysine MTases (human SETD6 and plant rubisco LSMT) and detected that SETD3 has weak lysine methylation activity on an actin variant in which the target His73 is substituted by a lysine (H73K) (27Dai S.

Prompted by the inhibitory effect of oncohistone mutations of lysine-to-methionine and similar endogenous MTases inhibiting sequences, here we report that unexpectedly, SETD3 has methylation activity on an actin variant in which the target His73 is substituted by a methionine (H73M). We investigate the structural and molecular determinants of generating S-methylmethionine in the context of a protein peptide. Our previous characterizations of SETD3 indicated that SETD3 exhibited in vitro activity on full-length recombinant actin-Lys73, albeit much weaker than actin-His73 activity (27Dai S. Horton J.R. Woodcock C.B. Wilkinson A.W. Zhang X. Gozani O. Cheng X. Structural basis for the target specificity of actin histidine methyltransferase SETD3.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 (31388018): 354110.1038/s41467-019-11554-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly we observed SETD3 activity on actin-Met73, in which the target His73 was substituted by a methionine (Fig. 2A). As a negative control, no activity was observed on actin-Ala73, in which His73 was replaced by an alanine. Consistent with the full-length recombinant protein, SETD3 exhibited activities on peptide substrates bearing either histidine, lysine, or methionine at position 73 (Fig. 2B). Under the saturating conditions of overnight reactions in which SETD3 completed reactions on its native substrate His73, we observed ∼50% reduced activity on Met73 and much reduced activity on Lys73. As aforementioned, the methyl donor SAM carries a positively charged methylsulfonium group (CH3–S+), and SAM-dependent MTases require the target atom be in a deprotonated state. In agreement with this mechanism, SETD3 has varied, substrate-dependent optimum pH values: an optimum pH of 7 and above for histidine where the imidazole ring (with a typical pKa value near 6) is uncharged and a pH of ∼10.5 for lysine (mainly because of its typical pKa value of ∼10) (27Dai S. Horton J.R. Woodcock C.B. Wilkinson A.W. Zhang X. Gozani O. Cheng X. Structural basis for the target specificity of actin histidine methyltransferase SETD3.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 (31388018): 354110.1038/s41467-019-11554-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In comparison, methionine has a nonpolar S-methyl thioether side chain, and SETD3 has a relatively constant activity on Met73 over a pH range of 5–11 with a small increase of activity at pH 8.0 (Fig. 2C) at the linear time point of 1 h (Fig. 2D). Although SETD3 has a catalytic efficiency kcat/Km of 1.8 h−1 μm−1 on His73 methylation (28Dai S. Horton J.R. Wilkinson A.W. Gozani O. Zhang X. Cheng X. An engineered variant of SETD3 methyltransferase alters target specificity from histidine to lysine methylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295 (31911441): 2582-258910.1074/jbc.RA119.012319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), SETD3 is a slow enzyme on Met73 without turnover (i.e. the product over the enzyme concentration is less than 1; [SAH]/[E] < 1). Under the first-order kinetics conditions, we estimated that SETD3 showed an activity on Met73 with an apparent kcat/Km value of ∼0.12 h−1 μm−1 (Fig. 2E). Next, we measured the dissociation constant between SETD3 and Met73 peptide by isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 2F). We observed a KD value of 25 nm, an increase of binding by a factor of 76 from the SETD3 dissociation of His73 peptide, which might partially explain the low turnover rate of Met73 from SETD3. This result of enhanced binding (reduced KD value) by the methionine-substituted peptide agrees with previous studies on LSD1 (∼30-fold) (14Forneris F. Binda C. Adamo A. Battaglioli E. Mattevi A. Structural basis of LSD1-CoREST selectivity in histone H3 recognition.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 (17537733): 20070-2007410.1074/jbc.C700100200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and PRC2 (∼20-fold) (12Justin N. Zhang Y. Tarricone C. Martin S.R. Chen S. Underwood E. De Marco V. Haire L.F. Walker P.A. Reinberg D. Wilson J.R. Gamblin S.J. Structural basis of oncogenic histone H3K27M inhibition of human polycomb repressive complex 2.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27121947): 1131610.1038/ncomms11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, the 25 nm dissociation constant matches well with the KD value of 32 nm observed between G9a and H3 peptide with the Lys9 replacement with norleucine in the presence of added SAM (11Jayaram H. Hoelper D. Jain S.U. Cantone N. Lundgren S.M. Poy F. Allis C.D. Cummings R. Bellon S. Lewis P.W.

Under the conditions that activity of SETD3 on Met73 is negligible (Fig. S1A), the Met73 peptide inhibits SETD3 activity on His73 with an IC50 of 1 μm (Fig. 2G), consistent with G9a inhibition by H3 peptide K9M with IC50 of 2.3 μm (11Jayaram H. Hoelper D. Jain S.U. Cantone N. Lundgren S.M. Poy F. Allis C.D. Cummings R. Bellon S. Lewis P.W.

SETD3 was readily crystallized with the Met73 (residues 66–88) peptide in the presence of SAH, and we observed electron density for peptide residues 66–84 (Fig. 3A). The ternary structure was determined to resolution of 1.9 Å (Table S1). The SETD3-Met73 structure is virtually identical to the previously determined structures of SETD3 in complex with His73 (PDB code 6MBJ), methylated His73 (PDB code 6OX2), or Lys73 (PDB code 6OX3) with pairwise comparison of less than 0.2 Å of root-mean-square deviation across two complexes of each crystal structure in the crystallographic asymmetric unit in space group P21 (Fig. 3B). In the methionine-occupied active site (Fig. 3C), the sulfur atom (Sδ) of Met73 is 5.3 Å away from the sulfur atom of SAH, in which a transferable methyl group would be attached (Fig. 3D). The observed conformations of the Met73 side chain and the methionine moiety of SAH in the active site is nearly symmetric to each other by a rotation of 180°. The nonpolar S-methyl thioether side chain is packed in between the aromatic rings of Tyr312 (via the Cγ atom) and Trp273. The terminal Cε carbon of Met73 is in van der Waals contact with the main chain Cα atom of Asp274 (3.4 Å), the indole ring of Trp273 (3.5 Å), and the side chain of Ile310 (4.0 Å) (Fig. 3E). In addition, the main chain Cα carbon of Met73 of actin forms a C–H···O type of hydrogen bond (29Horowitz S. Trievel R.C. Carbon-oxygen hydrogen bonding in biological structure and function.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (23048026): 41576-4158210.1074/jbc.R112.418574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) with side chain of Asn255 (Fig. 3F). The dominant nonpolar interactions give rise to favorable binding of Met73 in an active site constructed mainly of aromatic and hydrophobic residues; a greasy environment helps to deprotonate (lower the pKa value) lysine, as evident by the observed pKa value of 6.5 for a lysine fully buried inside the hydrophobic core in a mutant T4 lysozyme (30Dao-Pin S. Anderson D.E. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Matthews B.W. Structural and thermodynamic consequences of burying a charged residue within the hydrophobic core of T4 lysozyme.Biochemistry. 1991; 30 (1747370): 11521-1152910.1021/bi00113a006Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, the mutations of the polar residue Asn255 required for hydrogen bonding with His73 during catalysis (27Dai S. Horton J.R. Woodcock C.B. Wilkinson A.W. Zhang X. Gozani O. Cheng X. Structural basis for the target specificity of actin histidine methyltransferase SETD3.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 (31388018): 354110.1038/s41467-019-11554-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to hydrophobic residues alanine and valine improved activity for Met73 methylation by ∼3-fold (Fig. 3, G and H). Next, we determined the structure of mutant N255V in complex with the Met73 peptide to resolution of 1.76 Å (Table S1). The mutant structure is nearly identical to that of the WT enzyme, with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.16 Å across 946 pairs of Cα atoms (Fig. 3, I–J). The increased hydrophobicity of Val255, accompanied with the loss of polar interaction associated with Asn255, allows the side chain of Met73 of actin to move slightly toward to the methyl donor (Fig. 3I). We compared the structures of the SETD3-Met73 complex with that of three histone H3 MTases (G9a, PRC2, and SETD2) in complex with peptides containing methionine mutations at lysine 9, 27, and 36, respectively (10Shan C.M.

By superimposing the respective cofactor SAM or SAH, we observed two major differences. First, the histone H3 peptides and actin peptide run in opposite directions (Fig. 4A). Second, the methionine residues in the context of histone H3 are further away from the transferrable methyl group of SAM, whereas in the actin peptide, the methyl acceptor (sulfur Sδ) is located within a shorter distance of and in line with the incoming methyl group of the methylsulfonium of SAM (Fig. 4B). Such a linear arrangement comprising the nucleophile (Met-S:), the methyl group, and the leaving thioester group of SAM in the transition state is required for the SN2 reaction mechanism used by SAM-dependent MTases (Fig. 4C). Next, we tested three additional SET domain proteins, SET7 (31Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Borchers C. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Purification and functional characterization of a histone H3-lysine 4-specific methyltransferase.Mol.

Each enzyme is active on its respective lysine-containing peptide substrate (Fig. 4D) but not the peptides with the corresponding methionine substitution. The activity observed with PRDM9 on H3M4 peptide is probably due to the automethylation of PRDM9 (Fig. 4E), because intramolecular automethylation was observed previously on lysine residues by PRDM9 (34Koh-Stenta X. Poulsen A. Li R. Wee J.L. Kwek P.Z. Chew S.Y. Peng J. Wu L. Guccione E. Joy J. Hill J. Discovery and characterisation of the automethylation properties of PRDM9.Biochem. J. 2017; 474 (28126738): 971-98210.1042/BCJ20161067Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2). The difference of activity on methionine by SETD3 as compared with other SET domain proteins on histone H3 probably reflects the difference of their natural substrates: the smaller histidine residue needs to enter deeper into the active site of SETD3 and positions the target nitrogen atom pointing toward, and within a short distance of, the incoming methyl group, whereas the terminal nitrogen atom of the larger lysine residue in an extended side chain conformation can be positioned in the same target position even with the backbone of peptide being further away (Fig. 4F). The inactivity on methionine by histone MTases presumably reflects the fact that the methionine side chain is not juxtaposed in close enough proximity to the donor methyl group of SAM for nucleophilic attack (Fig. 4B). We note that in the case of SETD3 bound with Lys73 peptide, the side chain of Lys73 is in a bent conformation (Fig. 3B) (27Dai S. Horton J.R. Woodcock C.B. Wilkinson A.W. Zhang X. Gozani O. Cheng X.

The fungal cell wall is the primary target for antifungals and is recognized by host immune cells. Environmental conditions such as carbon sources, pH, temperature, and oxygen tension can modulate the fungal cell wall architecture. Cellular signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, are responsible for sensing environmental cues and mediating cell wall alterations. Although iron has recently been shown to affect β-1,3-glucan exposure on the cell wall, we report here that iron changes the composition of all major C. albicans cell wall components. Specifically, high iron decreased the levels of mannans (including phosphomannans) and chitin; and increased β-1,3-glucan levels. These changes increased the resistance of C. albicans to cell wall-perturbing antifungals. Moreover, high iron cells exhibited adequate mitochondrial functioning; leading to a reduction in accumulation of lactate that signals through the transcription factor Crz1 to induce β-1,3-glucan masking in C. albicans. We show here that iron-induced changes in β-1,3-glucan exposure are lactate-dependent; and high iron causes β-1,3-glucan exposure by preventing lactate-induced, Crz1-mediated inhibition of activation of the fungal MAPK Cek1. Furthermore, despite exhibiting enhanced antifungal resistance, high iron C. albicans cells had reduced survival upon phagocytosis by macrophages. Our results underscore the role of iron as an environmental signal in multiple signaling pathways that alter cell wall architecture in C. albicans, thereby affecting its survival upon exposure to antifungals and host immune response.

Iron is an essential transition metal that is required for several cellular processes including synthesis of heme and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-containing proteins, amino acids, DNA, lipids, and sterols (1Schaible U.E.

In excess, however, iron can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a biproduct of metabolic processes via Haber–Weiss/Fenton reaction (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.

Therefore, despite its importance in cellular functions, iron has reduced bioavailability in the mammalian host (4Sutak R. Lesuisse E. Tachezy J. Richardson D.R.

Virulence of C. albicans can be traced to several properties. These include: adhesion to host cells, biofilm formation, and morphological transition from yeast-to-hyphae (8Fourie R. Kuloyo O.O.

C. albicans cell wall consists of an outer layer of mannans, covalently associated with N-, O-, and ether-linked glycosylated cell wall proteins (mannoproteins), comprising 35–40% of the cell wall and an inner layer of β-glucans and chitin. β-Glucans are the major components of the inner cell wall (50–60% of the cell wall) and consist of a core structure that is largely made of β-1,3-glucans, along with a minor amount of β-1,6-glucan (14Arana D.M.

Changes to C. albicans cell wall architecture have been observed in response to different environmental conditions. Acidic environments such as lower pH or lactate reduce mannan levels in the outer cell wall layer, whereas limitation of zinc, another transition metal like iron, increases mannan levels (15Sherrington S.L.

On the other hand, acidic conditions reduce the thickness of the inner cell wall (18Ene I.V. Adya A.K. Wehmeier S. Brand A.C. MacCallum D.M. Gow N.A. Brown A.J.

However, zinc limitation altered chitin exposure on the cell surface, without affecting β-1,3-glucan levels (17Malavia D. Lehtovirta-Morley L.E. Alamir O. Weiß E. Gow N.A.R. Hube B. Wilson D.

Iron was been recently shown to affect exposure of β-1,3-glucan; however, overall effects of iron on the complex C. albicans cell wall structure remain unknown.

CWP agents inhibit fungal growth by targeting cell wall components to disrupt cell wall integrity. Tunicamycin binds to an enzyme UDP-GlcNAc:dolichyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase, which catalyzes the primary step of N-linked mannan synthesis (22Yoo J. Mashalidis E.H. Kuk A.C.Y.

Cottier F. Ernst J.F. Pla J. Msb2 signaling mucin controls activation of Cek1 mitogen-activated protein kinase in Candida albicans.Eukaryot.

Microbiol. 2014; 93 (24889932): 291-30510.1111/mmi.12659Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, zymolyase, a mixture of β-1,3-glucanases and proteases, lyses fungal cell by inhibiting β-1,3-glucan synthesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the activation of Slt2p (a homolog of C. albicans cell wall integrity MAPK Mkc1) makes cells resistant to glucanase digestion (24Boorsma A. de Nobel H. ter Riet B. Bargmann B. Brul S. Hellingwerf K.J. Klis F.M.

Suneetha K.J. Kaur R. The mitogen-activated protein kinase CgHog1 is required for iron homeostasis, adherence and virulence in Candida glabrata.FEBS J. 2015; 282 (25772226): 2142-216610.1111/febs.13264Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Also, Mkc1 and Cek1 MAPK pathways play a cooperative role in regulation of cell wall architecture in C. albicans (26Monge R.A. Roman E. Nombela C. Pla J. The MAP kinase signal transduction network in Candida albicans.Microbiology. 2006; 152 (16549655): 905-91210.1099/mic.0.28616-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Changes to C. albicans cell wall in response in host iron can therefore be consequential for the outcome of antifungal therapy. In addition, cell wall components are also crucial for host-pathogen interaction. These components act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and stimulate immune signaling, when recognized by host pattern recognition receptors (14Arana D.M. Prieto D. Roman E. Nombela C. Alonso-Monge R. Pla J. The role of the cell wall in fungal pathogenesis.Microb. Biotechnol. 2009; 2 (21261926): 308-32010.1111/j.1751-7915.2008.00070.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). β-1,3-Glucan and chitin are normally shielded by the superficial mannans to limit pathogen recognition (14Arana D.M. Prieto D. Roman E. Nombela C. Alonso-Monge R. Pla J. The role of the cell wall in fungal pathogenesis.Microb. Biotechnol. 2009; 2 (21261926): 308-32010.1111/j.1751-7915.2008.00070.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, changes in cell wall mannans can contribute to exposure of underlying β-1,3-glucan and chitin. Various environmental cues including iron can induce β-1,3-glucan masking to limit recognition of fungal cells and stimulation of cytokine production by host immune cells. However, MAPK Cek1 activation by phosphorylation (Cek1-P) is crucial for β-1,3-glucan unmasking or exposure. Despite this, numerous studies focusing on the effect of environmental conditions on β-1,3-glucan masking have not examined the status of Cek1 activation under those respective conditions and how it may contribute to β-1,3-glucan exposure levels. Here we reveal for the first time that changes in environmental iron modulate the levels of all major cell wall components of C. albicans. High iron-mediated changes to the cell wall, in turn, led to an enhanced resistance to CWP agents. We further define a novel mechanism by which iron influences β-1,3-glucan exposure. We show that iron communicates with a noncanonical pathway involving lactic acid signaling through Crz1; whereby high iron limits intracellular lactate accumulation to reduce Crz1-mediated inhibition of MAPK Cek1-activation, leading to β-1,3-glucan exposure. To examine whether iron can modulate fungal cell wall components, C. albicans cells were grown in YNB-based minimal medium without added iron or with 100 μm added iron, representing comparatively limited iron medium (LIM) and higher or replete iron medium (RIM). We next compared the intracellular iron levels in C. albicans cells grown in these respective medium with intracellular iron levels of cells grown in yeast-extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium, the most commonly used medium for fungal growth. C. albicans cells grown in our LIM had iron levels similar to YPD-grown cells, whereas cells grown in RIM showed a 97.83% increase in intracellular iron content, compared with YPD-grown cells (Fig. S1A). All three growth conditions maintained similar growth rates (Fig. S1B). LIM- and RIM-grown C. albicans cells were then used to measure the levels of all key components of the cell wall. The cells were stained with concanavalin A (ConA, for mannan), aniline blue (AB, for β-1,3-glucan), or CFW (for chitin), and mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) were measured. We also determined the levels of acid-labile mannans (phosphomannans) by measuring the levels of alcian blue binding to the cell surface. In response to changes in environmental iron, major differences in the levels of all key cell wall components were observed (Fig. 1). RIM-grown cells with higher intracellular iron (Fig. S1A) showed significantly lower fluorescence levels for ConA binding, indicating the presence of a much thinner layer of mannans, when compared with LIM cells (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the incidence of phosphomannans was significantly lower in RIM cells (Fig. S2). The levels of β-1,3-glucan, the dominant structure of the inner cell wall, were significantly higher in RIM cells (Fig. 1B); however, like mannans, levels of chitin were significantly lower in RIM-grown cells, compared with LIM cells (Fig. 1C). Because β-1,3-glucan levels in the β-glucan layer that is directly above the chitin layer were increased under high iron conditions, we also examined whether this led to a masking of chitin. Using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) stain, a lectin that specifically binds to surface-exposed chitin, we determined that high iron RIM cells showed significantly lower exposure of chitin, compared with cells grown in LIM (Fig. S3). Thus, iron modulates all major components of the fungal cell wall, and increase in intracellular iron potentially induces reduction in synthesis of mannan and chitin, along with reduced chitin exposure, whereas increasing β-1,3-glucan synthesis. Finally, to corroborate iron-mediated cell wall changes at a cellular structure level, we performed transmission EM to examine the ultrastructure of the cell wall of LIM and RIM cells. Micrographs of RIM cells showed a significantly thinner outer layer of mannans with a scattered fibrillar arrangement and a thicker inner layer (Fig. 2). Thus, iron changed the levels of individual cell wall components to drastically affect the cell wall at the structural level. We hypothesized that changes in C. albicans cell wall structure may influence its susceptibility to CWP agents. We thus compared the sensitivity of RIM and LIM cells to tunicamycin (inhibitor of N-linked mannosylation), zymolyase (β-1,3-glucanase), and CFW (that interferes with cross-linking of chitin). Our spot assay results revealed that compared with LIM cells, RIM cells were more resistant to tunicamycin (Fig. 3A) and CFW (Fig. 3C), and similarly, also more resistant to zymolyase, with a significant increase (14.24 ± 2.76%) in cell growth (Fig. 3B). Taken together with the effect of iron on the C. albicans cell wall (Fig. 1), these results show that high iron-induced changes to the cell wall made these cells more resistant to CWP antifungals. The observed changes in cell wall components (Fig. 1), particularly mannans, are known to cause exposure of β-1,3-glucan on the cell surface (27Hall R.A. Gow N.A. Mannosylation in Candida albicans: role in cell wall function and immune recognition.Mol.

We next tested the effect of iron on β-1,3-glucan exposure, using a monoclonal anti-β-1,3-glucan antibody and Cy3 labeling that allows for detection of exposed β-1,3-glucan in fungal cells. RIM cells displayed significantly higher levels of exposed β-1,3-glucans (1.7-fold increase), compared with LIM cells (Fig. 4A). This suggests that high iron conditions induce exposure of the β-1,3-glucan layer, most likely due to the thinner and scattered outer layer of mannan fibrils observed under high iron (Fig. 1A and 2Misslinger M. Lechner B.E. Bacher K. Haas H. Iron-sensing is governed by mitochondrial, not by cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis in Aspergillus fumigatus.Metallomics. 2018; 10 (30395137): 1687-170010.1039/c8mt00263kCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study showed triggering of β-1,3-glucan masking (thus reducing its exposure) through a lactate-mediated signaling pathway, when C. albicans cells were grown in presence of lactate as carbon source (16Ballou E.R. Avelar G.M. Childers D.S. Mackie J. Bain J.M. Wagener J. Kastora S.L. Panea M.D. Hardison S.E. Walker L.A. Erwig L.P. Munro C.A. Gow N.A. Brown G.D.

However, cells with comparatively lower iron can exhibit a reduction in mitochondrial function (29Grahl N. Demers E.G. Lindsay A.K. Harty C.E. Willger S.D. Piispanen A.E. Hogan D.A. Mitochondrial activity and Cyr1 are key regulators of Ras1 activation of C. albicans virulence pathways.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11 (26317337): e100513310.1371/journal.ppat.1005133Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) because many of the proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation are Fe-S cluster or heme iron-containing proteins. This, in turn, can shift cellular metabolism in these cells toward a fermentation-like process leading to enhanced lactic acid accumulation (30Finch C.A. Gollnick P.D. Hlastala M.P. Miller L.R. Dillmann E. Mackler B. Lactic acidosis as a result of iron deficiency.J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 129-13710.1172/JCI109431Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); whereas RIM cells with higher iron would instead show a reduction in lactate accumulation. We thus hypothesized that our glucose-grown RIM cells might have enhanced mitochondrial functioning that can limit lactate-mediated β-1,3-glucan masking. To examine this, we first tested mitochondrial function by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels in our glucose-grown C. albicans cells. High iron cells showed a 1.34-fold increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 4B) and a 1.6-fold increase in cellular ATP levels (Fig. 4C), indicating enhanced mitochondrial activity. To confirm if this, in turn, led to reduction in l-lactate (a dominant form of lactic acid) accumulation intracellularly, we also measured the levels of intracellular l-lactate, as well as extracellular levels (to account for release from the cells, if any). l-Lactate concentration was significantly lower under high iron RIM cells, compared with LIM-grown cells. Intracellular and extracellular concentrations were 2.7-fold (82.45 versus 226.5 μg/ml) and 28.8-fold (1.64 versus 47.35 μg/ml) lower, respectively, in RIM cells, compared with LIM cells (Fig. 4D). Additionally, changes in environmental iron can also alter cellular ROS production. We examined ROS levels in low and high iron C. albicans cells. As expected, we found that ROS production was higher in high iron RIM cells, as compared LIM-grown cells (Fig. 4E). We next sought to conform if reduction in l-lactate accumulation is indeed a contributing factor in the effect of high iron on enhanced β-1,3-glucan exposure. To understand this, we tested the effect of iron on β-1,3-glucan exposure in the presence of glucose or lactate as a sole carbon source, in parallel experiments. Interestingly, levels of β-1,3-glucan exposure were similar in lactate-grown LIM and RIM cells, with a clear loss of enhanced β-1,3-glucan exposure that was observed under high iron conditions (Fig. 4F), when glucose served as the sole carbon source (Fig. 4, A and F). As expected, both LIM and RIM cells grown on lactate also showed much higher levels of intracellular l-lactate (919.7 ± 134.7 and 791.7 ± 147.4, respectively; Fig. S4). Thus, enhanced intracellular l-lactate accumulation in LIM-grown cells with glucose as the sole carbon source (Fig. 4D), as well as exogenous lactate regardless of iron levels, both led to β-1,3-glucan masking (Fig. 4, A and F, respectively). This showed that lactate dominates over the effect of high iron on β-1,3-glucan exposure, and thus high iron-induced exposure in glucose-grown cells is a result of reduction in intracellular l-lactate accumulation. A role for lactate sensor (Gpr1) and transcriptional factor Crz1 in exogenous lactate-induced β-1,3-glucan masking has been demonstrated before (16Ballou E.R. Avelar G.M. Childers D.S. Mackie J. Bain J.M. Wagener J. Kastora S.L. Panea M.D. Hardison S.E. Walker L.A. Erwig L.P. Munro C.A. Gow N.A. Brown G.D. MacCallum D.M. et al.Lactate signalling regulates fungal β-glucan masking and immune evasion.Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 2 (27941860): 1623810.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.238Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). High iron in glucose-grown RIM C. albicans cells led to a decrease in intracellular as well as extracellular lactate, whereas glucose-grown LIM cells showed comparatively higher levels of both intra- and extracellular lactate (Fig. 4D). Hence, we next tested if the released extracellular l-lactate in LIM cells signals through Gpr1 to induce the observed β-1,3-glucan masking. We first examined β-1,3-glucan exposure levels in glucose-grown C. albicans gpr1Δ/gpr1Δ LIM and RIM cells, along with their respective parental WT and re-constituted strains (strains with reintegration of a single copy of the respective gene into the genome of the corresponding null mutant). Glucose-grown C. albicans cells lacking Gpr1 retained the effect of iron, with significant β-1,3-glucan masking observed in LIM cells (Fig. 5A). This showed that the effect of iron on levels of β-1,3-glucan exposure, in glucose-grown cells, is independent of Gpr1, and therefore, solely mediated by intracellular l-lactate. Furthermore, to examine the role of Crz1 on the effect of iron on β-1,3-glucan masking, we measured β-1,3-glucan exposure levels in glucose-grown crz1Δ/crz1Δ LIM and RIM cells, along with their respective parental WT and re-constituted strains. β-1,3-Glucan masking was blocked, resulting in β-1,3-glucan exposure, in glucose-grown LIM cells lacking Crz1; whereas the iron effect was restored to WT levels in the re-constituted strain (Fig. 5B). This suggests that enhanced intracellular l-lactate accumulation in LIM cells (Fig. 4D) mediates decrease in β-1,3-glucan exposure levels (causing masking instead), through Crz1 activation, independent of the lactate sensor Gpr1. Also, in C. albicans, the calcineurin pathway activates Crz1 in response to calcium and cell wall stress (31Karababa M. Valentino E. Pardini G. Coste A.T. Bille J. Sanglard D. CRZ1, a target of the calcineurin pathway in Candida albicans.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59 (16468987): 1429-145110.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.05037.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).

Transgenic and induced animal models suggest that it protects from cancer development but the mechanisms are uncertain. We investigated the role of immunity in GDF15 induced reduction in prostate cancer (PCa) growth. The C57BL/6 transgenic TRAMP prostate cancer prone mice were bred with mice that were immunodeficient and/or systemically overexpressed GDF15. We developed a novel orthotopic TRAMP PCa model in which primary TRAMP tumor cells were implanted into prostates of mice to reduce the study time. These mice were administered recombinant mouse GDF15, antibody to CD8, PD1 or their respective controls. We found that GDF15 induced protection from tumor growth was reversed by lack of adaptive immunity. Flow cytometric evaluation of lymphocytes within these orthotopic tumors showed that GDF15 overexpression was associated with increased CD8 T cell numbers and an increased number and proportion of recently activated CD8+CD11c+ T cells and a reduced proportion of ""exhausted"" CD8+PD1+ T cells. Further, depletion of CD8 T cells in tumor bearing mice abolished the GDF15 induced protection from tumor growth. Infusion of GDF15 into mice bearing orthotopic TRAMP tumor, substantially reduced tumor growth that was further reduced by concurrent PD1 antibody administration. GDF15 overexpression or recombinant protein protects from TRAMP tumor growth by modulating CD8 T cell mediated antitumor immunity and augments the positive effects of anti-PD1 blockers."
https://openalex.org/W3033052120,"Agricultural development projects have a poor track record of success mainly due to risks and uncertainty involved in implementation. Cost-benefit analysis can help allocate resources more effectively, but scarcity of data and high uncertainty makes it difficult to use standard approaches. Bayesian Networks (BN) offer a suitable modelling technology for this domain as they can combine expert knowledge and data. This paper proposes a systematic methodology for creating a general BN model for evaluating agricultural development projects. Our approach adapts the BN model to specific projects by using systematic review of published evidence and relevant data repositories under the guidance of domain experts. We evaluate a large-scale agricultural investment in Africa to provide a proof of concept for this approach. The BN model provides decision support for project evaluation by predicting the value—measured as net present value and return on investment—of the project under different risk scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3033577414,"Humans have limited regenerative potential of musculoskeletal tissues following limb or digit loss. The murine digit has been used to study mammalian regeneration, where stem/progenitor cells (the “blastema”) completely regenerate the digit tip after distal, but not proximal, amputation. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this response remain to be determined. Here, we evaluated the spatiotemporal formation of bone and fibrous tissues after level-dependent amputation of the murine terminal phalanx and quantified the transcriptome of the repair tissue. Distal (regenerative) and proximal (non-regenerative) amputations showed significant differences in temporal gene expression and tissue regrowth over time. Genes that direct skeletal system development and limb morphogenesis are transiently upregulated during blastema formation and differentiation, including distal Hox genes. Overall, our results suggest that digit tip regeneration is controlled by a gene regulatory network that recapitulates aspects of limb development, and that failure to activate this developmental program results in fibrotic wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W3034078709,"Type 1 cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) play important roles in human cardiovascular physiology, regulating vascular tone and smooth-muscle cell phenotype. A mutation in the human PRKG1 gene encoding cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (PKG1) leads to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. The mutation causes an arginine-to-glutamine (RQ) substitution within the first cGMP-binding pocket in PKG1. This substitution disrupts cGMP binding to the pocket, but it also unexpectedly causes PKG1 to have high activity in the absence of cGMP via an unknown mechanism. Here, we identified the molecular mechanism whereby the RQ mutation increases basal kinase activity in the human PKG1α and PKG1β isoforms. Although we found that the RQ substitution (R177Q in PKG1α and R192Q in PKG1β) increases PKG1α and PKG1β autophosphorylation in vitro, we did not detect increased autophosphorylation of the PKG1α or PKG1β RQ variant isolated from transiently transfected 293T cells, indicating that increased basal activity of the RQ variants in cells was not driven by PKG1 autophosphorylation. Replacement of Arg-177 in PKG1α with alanine or methionine also increased basal activity. PKG1 exists as a parallel homodimer linked by an N-terminal leucine zipper, and we show that the WT chain in WT-RQ heterodimers partly reduces basal activity of the RQ chain. Using hydrogen/deuterium-exchange MS, we found that the RQ substitution causes PKG1β to adopt an active conformation in the absence of cGMP, similar to that of cGMP-bound WT enzyme. We conclude that the RQ substitution in PKG1 increases its basal activity by disrupting the formation of an inactive conformation."

Dietary oligosaccharides, given to the sow, proved beneficial for the offspring’s performance. However, giving oligosaccharides to the suckling piglet is poorly explored. Therefore, this field trial studied the effect of dietary short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS; 1g/day; drenched) supplementation to low (LBW, lower quartile), normal (NBW, two intermediate quartiles) and high (HBW, upper quartile) birth weight piglets from birth until 7 or 21 days of age. Performance parameters, gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acids profile of feces and digesta were assessed at birth (d 0), d 7, weaning (d 21.5) and 2 weeks post-weaning (d 36.5). Additional parameters reflecting gut health (intestinal integrity and morphology, mucosal immune system) were analysed at d 36.5. Most parameters changed with age or differed with the piglet’s birth weight. Drenching with scFOS increased body weight by 1 kg in NBW suckling piglets and reduced the post-weaning mortality rate by a 100%. No clear difference in the IgG level, the microbiota composition and fermentative activity between the treatment groups was observed. Additionnally, intestinal integrity, determined by measuring intestinal permeability and regenerative capacity, was similar between the treatment groups. Also, intestinal architecture (villus lenght, crypt depth) was not affected by scFOS supplementation. The density of intra-epithelial lymphocytes and the expression profiles (real-time qPCR) for immune system-related genes (IL-10, IL-1ß, IL-6, TNFα and IFNγ) were used to assess mucosal immunity. Only IFNγ expression, was upregulated in piglets that received scFOS for 7 days. The improved body weight and the reduced post-weaning mortality seen in piglets supplemented with scFOS support the view that scFOS positively impact piglet’s health and resilience. However, the modes of action for these effects are not yet fully elucidated and its potential to improve other performance parameters needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3032980006,"Voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) β1 subunits are multifunctional proteins that modulate the biophysical properties and cell-surface localization of VGSC α subunits and participate in cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion, all with important implications for intracellular signal transduction, cell migration, and differentiation. Human loss-of-function variants in SCN1B, the gene encoding the VGSC β1 subunits, are linked to severe diseases with high risk for sudden death, including epileptic encephalopathy and cardiac arrhythmia. We showed previously that β1 subunits are post-translationally modified by tyrosine phosphorylation. We also showed that β1 subunits undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis via the activity of β-secretase 1 and γ-secretase, resulting in the generation of a soluble intracellular domain, β1-ICD, which modulates transcription. Here, we report that β1 subunits are phosphorylated by FYN kinase. Moreover, we show that β1 subunits are S-palmitoylated. Substitution of a single residue in β1, Cys-162, to alanine prevented palmitoylation, reduced the level of β1 polypeptides at the plasma membrane, and reduced the extent of β1-regulated intramembrane proteolysis, suggesting that the plasma membrane is the site of β1 proteolytic processing. Treatment with the clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitor, Dyngo-4a, re-stored the plasma membrane association of β1-p.C162A to WT levels. Despite these observations, palmitoylation-null β1-p.C162A modulated sodium current and sorted to detergent-resistant membrane fractions normally. This is the first demonstration of S-palmitoylation of a VGSC β subunit, establishing precedence for this post-translational modification as a regulatory mechanism in this protein family."

We set out to determine whether higher levels of disease-related knowledge reduce medical acceleration. Methods We evaluated the levels of disease-related knowledge in all patients at the time of enrollment for SNUBH IBD cohort using the validated IBD-KNOW questionnaire. Clinical data were prospectively collected and the factors related to step-up therapy were analyzed. Step-up therapy was defined as the new use of corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or biologics after the enrollment. Results Between April 2017 and January 2019, 298 patients were enrolled (mean age, 39.8 years; males, 69.5%); 193 patients (64.8%) had ulcerative colitis and 105 (35.2%) had Crohn’s disease. The mean disease duration was 35.8 months. During the mean follow-up of 14.7 months, 90 patients (30.2%) underwent step-up therapy and 208 (69.8%) underwent continuous therapy. The prevalence of continuous therapy increased with increasing IBD-KNOW scores (p for trend = 0.019). Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high IBD-KNOW scores (≥ 16) (hazards ratio [HR]: 0.498, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.276–0.897, p = 0.020) was negatively associated with the step-up therapy. Conclusions Higher disease-related knowledge could reduce the requirement of step-up therapy in IBD. The IBD-KNOW score was independently predictive of step-up therapy."

Our aim was to analyse the association between socioeconomic status, family structure and children’s psychosocial problems at the age of 7, 11, 15 and 18 years in 3,261 subjects and compare our results with findings from western settings. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and its five subscales were used to assess individual problem areas (emotional symptoms, peer problems, hyperactivity, conduct problems) and prosocial behaviour. Socioeconomic status was represented by maternal education and three forms of family structure were identified: nuclear family, new partner family and single parent family. The SDQ subscale score over time was modelled as a quadratic growth curve using a linear mixed-effects model. Maternal university education was associated with a faster decline in problems over time for all five SDQ subscales. Problems in children from nuclear families were found to be significantly lower than in children from single parent families for all SDQ subscales with the exception of peer problems. Compared to nuclear families, children from new partner families scored significantly higher in hyperactivity and conduct problems subscales. The nuclear family structure and higher maternal education have been identified as protective factors for children’s psychosocial problems, in agreement with findings from western settings. Adopting a longitudinal perspective was shown as essential for providing a more complex view of children’s psychosocial problems over time."

Whether deleterious effects are direct on the offspring or secondary to alterations in uteroplacental physiology is unclear. Here, we isolated direct effects of glucocorticoids using the chicken embryo, a model system in which the effects on the developing heart and circulation of therapy can be investigated, independent of effects on the mother and/or the placenta. Fertilized chicken eggs were incubated and divided randomly into control (C) or dexamethasone (Dex) treatment at day 14 out of the 21-day incubation period. Combining functional experiments at the isolated organ, cellular and molecular levels, embryos were then studied close to term. Chicken embryos exposed to dexamethasone were growth restricted and showed systolic and diastolic dysfunction, with an increase in cardiomyocyte volume but decreased cardiomyocyte nuclear density in the left ventricle. Underlying mechanisms included a premature switch from tissue accretion to differentiation, increased oxidative stress, and activated signaling of cellular senescence. These findings, therefore, demonstrate that dexamethasone treatment can have direct detrimental off-target effects on the cardiovascular system in the developing embryo, which are independent of effects on the mother and/or placenta."

Methods We carried out a retrospective cohort study among women for whom a documented HIV-negative test result from the first pregnancy trimester could be confirmed using available records, and who were HIV-retested in the third trimester or during delivery. In total, 1610 pregnant women from three different healthcare settings took part in the study. We captured the results of repeated HIV tests and conducted semi-structured interviews to explore participants’ socio-demographic characteristics and sexual risk behavior. For HIV incidence rates, we calculated the number of seroconversions per 100 person-years. We used Fisher's exact test to test for potential associations. Penalized maximum likelihood logistic regression and Poisson regression were applied to adjust for potential confounders. Results The overall HIV incidence rate among participants was 2.9/100 women-years. Among socio-demographic characteristics, the multivariable analysis showed a significant association of marital status with HIV incidence in pregnancy (IRR 8.78, 95%CI [1.13–68.33]). Risky sexual behaviors including higher number of sexual partners in pregnancy (IRR 2.78 [1.30–5.94]), unprotected sex with unknown persons (IRR 14.25 [4.52–44.93]), alcohol abuse (IRR 12.08 [4.18–34.90]) and sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol (IRR 6.33 [1.36–29.49]) were significantly associated with seroconversion in pregnancy (similar results in logistic regression). Conclusions HIV incidence was three times higher among our pregnant study population compared to the general female population in Uganda. This underlines the importance of HIV prevention and repeat testing during pregnancy. Identified risk groups should be considered for pre-exposure prophylaxis."

As a part of the Food safety Modernization Act (FSMA), The Produce Safety rule has established several requirements for testing for the presence of generic Escherichia coli in water, but the current method available for testing (EPA M1603) demands specified multiple colony verification and highly trained personnel to perform these tests. The purpose of the study was to assess a phage induced bacterial lysis using quantitative image analysis to achieve rapid detection of E. coli at low concentrations within 8 hours. This study aimed to develop a simple yet highly sensitive and specific approach to detect target bacteria in complex matrices. In the study, E. coli cells were first enriched in tryptic soy broth (TSB), followed by T7 phage induced lysis, concentration, staining and fluorescent imaging. Image analysis was conducted including image pre-processing, image segmentation and quantitatively analysis of cellular morphological features (area, eccentricity and full width at half maximum). Challenge experiments using realistic matrices, including simulated fresh produce wash water, coconut water and spinach wash water, demonstrated the method can be applied for use in situations that occur in food processing facilities. The results indicated E. coli cells that are lysed by T7 phages demonstrated significantly (P < 0.05) higher extracellular DNA release, altered cellular shape (from rod to circular) and diffused fluorescent signal intensity. Using this biosensing strategy, a sensitivity to detect Escherichia coli at 10 CFU/ml within 8 hours was achieved, both in laboratory medium and in complex matrices. The proposed phage based biosensing strategy enables rapid detection of bacteria and is applicable to analysis of food systems. Furthermore, the steps involved in this assay can be automated to enable detection of target bacteria in food facilities without extensive resources."

Step 1, pre-processing, including imputation, normalization, and re-ordering of the samples. Step 2, training, where SI algorithms optimize hyper-parameters of back-propagation artificial neural networks (BP-ANN) with the area under curve (AUC) as the evaluation function. Step 3, test, applying the optimized model in Step 2 to predict new samples. The results show that the framework proposed in this paper searches the hyper-parameter space efficiently and finds the optimal set of hyper parameters with appropriate time complexity, which enhances the fitting and generalization ability of BP-ANN. Compared with existing credit-scoring models, the model in this paper predicts with a higher accuracy. Additionally, the model enjoys a greater robustness, for the difference of performance between training and testing phases."

Only half a century ago, EA/TEF was fatal among affected newborns suggesting that the steady birth prevalence might in parts be due to mutational de novo events in genes involved in foregut development. Methods To identify mutational de novo events in EA/TEF patients, we surveyed the exome of 30 case-parent trios. Identified and confirmed de novo variants were prioritized using in silico prediction tools. To investigate the embryonic role of genes harboring prioritized de novo variants we performed targeted analysis of mouse transcriptome data of esophageal tissue obtained at the embryonic day (E) E8.5, E12.5, and postnatal. Results In total we prioritized 14 novel de novo variants in 14 different genes (APOL2, EEF1D, CHD7, FANCB, GGT6, KIAA0556, NFX1, NPR2, PIGC, SLC5A2, TANC2, TRPS1, UBA3, and ZFHX3) and eight rare de novo variants in eight additional genes (CELSR1, CLP1, GPR133, HPS3, MTA3, PLEC, STAB1, and PPIP5K2). Through personal communication during the project, we identified an additional EA/TEF case-parent trio with a rare de novo variant in ZFHX3. In silico prediction analysis of the identified variants and comparative analysis of mouse transcriptome data of esophageal tissue obtained at E8.5, E12.5, and postnatal prioritized CHD7, TRPS1, and ZFHX3 as EA/TEF candidate genes. Re-sequencing of ZFHX3 in additional 192 EA/TEF patients did not identify further putative EA/TEF-associated variants. Conclusion Our study suggests that rare mutational de novo events in genes involved in foregut development contribute to the development of EA/TEF."

This study investigates the role of TRPV4 channels, which are transmembrane calcium channels that can regulate vascular tone, in modulating AAA formation. The elastase-treatment model of AAA in C57BL6 (WT) mice and Angiotensin II treatment model in ApoE−/− mice were used to confirm our hypotheses. The administration of a specific TRPV4 antagonist, GSK2193874, in elastase-treated WT mice and in AngII-treated ApoE−/− mice caused a significant attenuation of aortic diameter, decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-2, RANTES, and TNF-α), inflammatory cell infiltration (CD3 + T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils), elastic fiber disruption, and an increase in smooth muscle cell α-actin expression compared to untreated mice. Similarly, elastase-treated TRPV4−/− mice had a significant decrease in AAA formation, aortic inflammation, and vascular remodeling compared to elastase-treated WT mice on Day 14. In vitro studies demonstrated that the inhibition of TRPV4 channels mitigates aortic smooth muscle cell-dependent inflammatory cytokine production as well as decreases neutrophil transmigration through aortic endothelial cells. Therefore, our results suggest that TRPV4 antagonism can attenuate aortic inflammation and remodeling via decreased smooth muscle cell activation and neutrophil transendothelial migration during AAA formation."
https://openalex.org/W3033579087,"Insects have long been thought to largely not require hemoglobins, with some notable exceptions like the red hemolymph of chironomid larvae. The tubular, branching network of tracheae in hexapods is traditionally considered sufficient for their respiration. Where hemoglobins do occur sporadically in plants and animals, they are believed to be either convergent, or because they are ancient in origin and their expression is lost in many clades. Our comprehensive analysis of 845 Hexapod transcriptomes, totaling over 38 Gbases, revealed the expression of hemoglobins in all 32 orders of hexapods, including the 29 recognized orders of insects. Discovery and identification of 1333 putative hemoglobins were achieved with target-gene BLAST searches of the NCBI TSA database, verifying functional residues, secondary- and tertiary-structure predictions, and localization predictions based on machine learning. While the majority of these hemoglobins are intracellular, extracellular ones were recovered in 38 species. Gene trees were constructed via multiple-sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses. These indicate duplication events within insects and a monophyletic grouping of hemoglobins outside other globin clades, for which we propose the term insectahemoglobins. These hemoglobins are phylogenetically adjacent and appear structurally convergent with the clade of chordate myoglobins, cytoglobins, and hemoglobins. Their derivation and co-option from early neuroglobins may explain the widespread nature of hemoglobins in various kingdoms and phyla. These results will guide future work involving genome comparisons to transcriptome results, experimental investigations of gene expression, cell and tissue localization, and gas binding properties, all of which are needed to further illuminate the complex respiratory adaptations in insects."

Questions derived from a systematic review and expert opinions guided the interviews which were audio-recorded, transcribed and de-identified. Two researchers independently conducted thematic analysis and reached consensus on emerging themes.There were 16 participants. Four themes were identified: (i) there are beliefs and preferences about exercise and physical activity that can impact on engagement; (ii) difficulty coping with disease progression impacts activities; (iii) facilitators to exercise include individual preferences, access to facilities and expert advice; and (iv) perceived barriers include beliefs about limited exercise options, falls risk, cost, transport and access to credible information.People living with PSP want early guidance about the condition and the role of exercise. It is important to quickly enable people to have access to evidence and resources supporting exercise and structured physical activities.

However, surgeons require specific standards of professionalism for certain context-based situations. In addition to communication, studies require collaboration, leadership, error-/conflict-management, patient-safety and decision-making as essential competencies for surgeons. Standards for corresponding competencies are defined in special chapters of the German National Competency-based Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Education (NKLM; chapter 8, 10). The current study asks whether these chapters are adequately taught in surgical curricula. Eight German faculties contributed to analysing mapping data considering surgical courses of undergraduate programs. All faculties used the MERlin mapping platform and agreed on procedures for data collection and processing. Sub-competency and objective coverage, as well as the achievement of the competency level were mapped. Overall counts of explicit citations were used for analysis. Collaboration within the medical team is a strongly represented topic. In contrast, interprofessional cooperation, particularly in healthcare sector issues is less represented. Patient safety and dealing with errors and complications is most emphasized for the Manager/Leader, while time management, career planning and leadership are not addressed. Overall, the involvement of surgery in teaching the competencies of the Collaborator and Manager/Leader is currently low. However, there are indications of a curricular development towards explicit teaching of these roles in surgery. Moreover, implicitly taught roles are numerous, which indicates a beginning awareness of professional roles."

Data were collected during the autumn of 2015 and comprised 41 interviews and seven focus group discussions. Participants included primary care-takers who had experienced recent newborn illness or death, health care workers and community members. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Choices about whether, where and how to seek care for ill newborns were made through cooperation and negotiation among household members. Mothers were considered the ones that initially identified or recognised illness, but their actual opportunities to seek care were bounded by structural and cultural constraints. Mothers’ limited bargaining power, contained by financial resources and gendered decision making, shaped their roles in care-seeking. We identified three strategies mothers took on in decision making for newborn illness: (a) acceptance and adaptation (to the lack of options), (b) negotiation and avoidance of advice from others, and (c) active care-seeking and opposition against the husband’s or community’s advice. Conclusion While the literature on newborn health and parenting emphasizes the key role of mothers in care-seeking, their actual opportunities to seek care are shaped by factors commonly beyond their control. Efforts to promote care-seeking for ill children should recognise that mothers’ capabilities to make decisions are embedded in gendered social processes and financial power structures. Thus, policies should not only target individual mothers, but the wider decision making group, including the head of households and extended family."
https://openalex.org/W3033935672,"Vitamin B12 and other cobamides are essential cofactors required by many organisms and are synthesized by a subset of prokaryotes via distinct aerobic and anaerobic routes. The anaerobic biosynthesis of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), the lower ligand of vitamin B12, involves five reactions catalyzed by the bza operon gene products, namely the hydroxybenzimidazole synthase BzaAB/BzaF, phosphoribosyltransferase CobT, and three methyltransferases, BzaC, BzaD, and BzaE, that conduct three distinct methylation steps. Of these, the methyltransferases that contribute to benzimidazole lower ligand diversity in cobamides remain to be characterized, and the precise role of the bza operon protein CobT is unclear. In this study, we used the bza operon from the anaerobic bacterium Moorella thermoacetica (comprising bzaA-bzaB-cobT-bzaC) to examine the role of CobT and investigate the activity of the first methyltransferase, BzaC. We studied the phosphoribosylation catalyzed by MtCobT and found that it regiospecifically activates 5-hydroxybenzimidazole (5-OHBza) to form the 5-OHBza-ribotide (5-OHBza-RP) isomer as the sole product. Next, we characterized the domains of MtBzaC and reconstituted its methyltransferase activity with the predicted substrate 5-OHBza and with two alternative substrates, the MtCobT product 5-OHBza-RP and its riboside derivative 5-OHBza-R. Unexpectedly, we found that 5-OHBza-R is the most favored MtBzaC substrate. Our results collectively explain the long-standing observation that the attachment of the lower ligand in anaerobic cobamide biosynthesis is regiospecific. In conclusion, we validate MtBzaC as a SAM:hydroxybenzimidazole-riboside methyltransferase (HBIR-OMT). Finally, we propose a new pathway for the synthesis and activation of the benzimidazolyl lower ligand in anaerobic cobamide biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3033297976,"Although identified to be at a higher risk of relapse, no consensus exists on the treatment of breast cancer (BC) patients with no pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy (ADJ) in this context has scarcely been studied. We evaluated the benefit of administrating adjuvant chemotherapy in a real life cohort of BC patients with invasive residual disease after NAC. 1199 female BC patients with T1-3NxM0 invasive tumors receiving NAC at Institut Curie from 2002 to 2012 were included in the analysis. 1061 had been treated by NAC only, whereas 138 had received additional adjuvant chemotherapy after NAC (FUN protocol: 5-FU-Vinorelbine). We compared disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates between patients having received NAC only and patients having received NAC+ADJ. To ensure comparability of our populations, we used a propensity score (which defines the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline covariates) and matched each patient having received NAC+ADJ (n = 138) with a patient having received NAC only that had a similar propensity score value. Before propensity score matching, DFS and OS rates were significantly lower in the NAC+ADJ group compared to NAC only, after 3 years, 5 years and 10 years follow-up (p<0.01). After one-to-one PS matching, the two groups were comparable (n = 276 patients; 138 patients in each group). No significant difference was found regarding DFS (p = 0.87) or OS (p = 0.59) rates, neither in global population, nor by pathological subtype. Although our study did not show a benefit of administrating ADJ with FUN protocol (5-Florouracil- Vinorelbine) to BC patients with residual disease after NAC, further studies are warranted to determine the impact of other adjuvant regimens. Thereby, patients with little chance of responding to particular regimens could avoid the toxicity of futile therapy, and be study participants in evaluations of novel treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3033653866,"The presence of the chimeric EWSR1-FLI1 oncoprotein is the main and initiating event defining Ewing sarcoma (ES). The dysregulation of epigenomic and proteomic homeostasis induced by the oncoprotein contributes to a wide variety of events involved in oncogenesis and tumor progression. Attempts at studying the effects of EWSR1-FLI1 in non-tumor cells to understand the mechanisms underlying sarcomagenesis have been unsuccessful to date, as ectopic expression of EWSR1-FLI1 blocks cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis in the tested cell lines. Therefore, it is essential to find a permissive cell type for EWSR1-FLI1 expression that allows its endogenous molecular functions to be studied. Here we have demonstrated that HeLa cell lines are permissive to EWSR1-FLI1 ectopic expression, and that our model substantially recapitulates the endogenous activity of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein. This model could contribute to better understanding ES sarcomagenesis by helping to understand the molecular mechanisms induced by the EWSR1-FLI1 oncoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W3032932973,"In the problem where there is not enough data to use Deep Learning, Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) is still a good alternative for image classification. In BoVW model, many pooling methods are proposed to incorporate the spatial information of local feature into the image representation vector, but none of the methods devote to making each visual word have its own pooling regions. The practice of designing the same pooling regions for all the words restrains the discriminability of image representation, since the spatial distributions of the local features indexed by different visual words are not same. In this paper, we propose to make each visual word have its own pooling regions, and raise a simple yet effective method for learning pooling region. Concretely, a kind of small window named observation window is used to obtain its responses to each word over the whole image region. The pooling regions of each word are organized by a kind of tree structure, in which each node indicates a pooling region. For each word, its pooling regions are learned by constructing a tree with its labelled coordinate data. The labelled coordinate data consist of the coordinates of responses and image class labels. The effectiveness of our method is validated by observing if there is an obvious classification accuracy improvement after applying our method. Our experimental results on four small datasets (i.e., Scene-15, Caltech-101, Caltech-256 and Corel-10) show that, the classification accuracy is improved by about 1% to 2.5%. We experimentally demonstrate that the practice of making each word have its own pooling regions is beneficial to image classification task, which is the significance of our work."

https://openalex.org/W3033380079,"Our objective was to describe the clinical presentation of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in patients living with HIV (PLHIV) during the 2014 Martinique outbreak. During the outbreak and the 6 following months, all PLHIV coming in our unit for a medical evaluation answered questions about potential CHIKV related symptoms, and had blood tests to assess the diagnosis. For patients coming in at the acute phase of infection, we are able to provide and analyze CD4+, CD8+ T-cells and HIV viral load evolution before, during and after CHIK infection. Among the 1 003 PLHIV in care in the center at the time of the outbreak, 188 (94 men and 94 women) had confirmed (following the WHO definition) CHIKV infection. Clinical presentation was common in 63% of the cases, severe and atypical forms were scarce. During the acute phase, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (evaluated in 30 PLHIV, 15 men and 15 women) absolute numbers dropped significantly, but returned to pre-CHIKV values after the acute phase. Reassuringly, CD4 and CD8 T cells proportions did not decrease during the acute phase. CHIKV infection had no significant impact on this anti-retroviral treated population."

https://openalex.org/W3033338041,"Background Studies comparing prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) using DSM-IV and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria in college students are limited. This study examines changes in AUD prevalence estimates using DSM-IV versus DSM-5 and characterizes the profile of DSM-5 “diagnostic orphans.” Methods and findings A college student sample (n = 1,155; mean age: 21 ±1.97) selected conveniently from six large private and public universities in Greater Beirut, Lebanon completed an anonymous survey in May 2016. The study response rate was 83.1%. Data on DSM-IV and DSM-5 AUD criteria were gathered from 582 past-year drinkers, of which 377 (65%) were screened to have DSM-IV abuse/dependence, and 203 (35%) to have any DSM-5 AUD (58% mild, 21% moderate, and 21% severe). Overall percent agreement between measures was 68% (kappa = 0.41). One hundred and ninety-one students met one DSM-5 AUD criterion only (i.e. “diagnostic orphans,” herein DOs), of which the majority (82%) endorsed “hazardous use.” Compared to past-year drinkers with zero-endorsed DSM-5 criteria, DOs were more likely to be aged 21 or above [OR = 1.57(1.21–2.03)], less likely to perceive their socioeconomic status (SES) as poorer vs. same as others [OR = 0.17(0.07–0.43)], more likely to drink 1–2 times/week vs. ≤3 times per month [OR = 2.24(1.44–3.49)], and more likely to report past-year cigarette smoking [OR = 2.16(1.10–4.24)]. When compared to past-year drinkers with DSM-5 AUD, DOs were more likely to be pursuing a graduate or medical degree (vs. undergraduate degree) [2.06 (1.09–3.89)], and to be living with parents most of the time vs. not [OR = 2.68(1.14–6.31)]. DOs (versus drinkers with AUD) were less likely to drink at a high frequency (3–4 times /week or more vs.≤3 times per month) [OR = 0.15(0.05–0.48)], and to report past-year waterpipe smoking [OR = 0.54(0.34–0.85)], but more likely to report past-year marijuana use [1.89(1.10–3.23)]. The findings are subject to recall bias and under-reporting and the study could not infer causality because temporality of associations cannot be established in a cross-sectional study design. Conclusions DSM-IV abuse/dependence prevalence rate was higher than DSM-5 AUD prevalence mainly due to the high percentage of students who engaged in “hazardous use”. The DO screen might capture a young person in transition between non-drinking/occasional drinking to drinking frequently/developing an AUD. The prevention, identification, and management of DOs may be critical components of a national alcohol harm-reduction policy."
https://openalex.org/W3033352071,"In prokaryotes, repair by homologous recombination provides a major means to reinstate the genetic information lost in DNA damage. Recent research on recombination repair in mycobacteria has led to significant revision of the understanding of this system. A comparative analysis of the system, carried out in 43 mycobacterial genomes, lead to identification of novel proteins. To substantiate the predictions, biochemical and structural investigations on probable roles of two proteins, namely, SSBb and RecGwed, were carried out. The structure of M. smegmatis SSBb (MsSSBb), was determined at 2.5 □ resolution. Solution studies indicate that the canonical SSB (MsSSBa) is more stable towards thermal and chemical denaturation than MsSSBb. Also, MsSSBa has a two-fold higher DNA binding affinity than MsSSBb. A direct physical interaction between MsSSBb and MsRecA was established, suggesting a role during recombination. The expression levels of ssbB gene increased by approximately two- and sevenfold in UV and hypoxic stress, respectively, while concurrently the levels of ssbA expression declined. These results indicate a role of MsSSBb in recombination repair during stress. MsRecGwed binds a variety of branched DNA structures in vitro, while it does not bind ss- or dsDNA. The up-regulation of recGwed during UV damage, and down-regulation during H2O2/MMS stress, in M. smegmatis indicated a possible role in post-replicative recombination events that proceed though branched DNA intermediates. Taken together, this work augments the understanding of the repertoire of proteins known to be involved in DNA repair pathways in mycobacteria.

https://openalex.org/W3033916824,"Low plasma testosterone, either spontaneous or as a result of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. The underlying mechanism in humans is not understood. Experimental studies in mice have shown that castration facilitates atherogenesis and may increase signs of plaque vulnerability. Pigs used for translational atherosclerosis research have frequently been castrated for practical or commercial reasons, but the effect of castration on atherosclerosis has never been systematically evaluated in pigs.To study the effect of castration on atherosclerotic plaque burden and type in genetically modified minipigs with hypercholesterolemia.Newborn male Yucatan minipigs with transgenic overexpression of a human gain-of-function mutant of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 were randomized to undergo orchiectomy (n = 8) or serve as controls (n = 6). Minipigs were started on high-fat diet at 3 months of age and the amount and composition of atherosclerotic lesions were analyzed at 12 months of age. Plasma lipid profiles and behavioral parameters were also assessed.Plasma lipids were slightly affected to a more atherogenic profile by orchiectomy, but atherosclerotic lesion size was unaltered in the LAD, thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, and iliac arteries. The distribution of lesion types (xanthomas, pathological intimal thickening and fibroatheromas) were also not statistically different between groups in any of the examined vascular territories. The abdominal aorta developed the most advanced stages of disease with reproducible fibroatheroma formation, and here it was found that the area of necrotic core was significantly increased in orchiectomized pigs compared with controls. Orchiectomy also reduced aggressive behavior.Castration does not alter the burden of atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic Yucatan minipigs, but may increase necrotic core area in fibroatheromas."
