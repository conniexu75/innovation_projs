https://openalex.org/W2461419449,"The Paris climate agreement aims at holding global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and to “pursue efforts” to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To accomplish this, countries have submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) outlining their post-2020 climate action. Here we assess the effect of current INDCs on reducing aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, its implications for achieving the temperature objective of the Paris climate agreement, and potential options for overachievement. The INDCs collectively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to where current policies stand, but still imply a median warming of 2.6–3.1 degrees Celsius by 2100. More can be achieved, because the agreement stipulates that targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are strengthened over time, both in ambition and scope. Substantial enhancement or over-delivery on current INDCs by additional national, sub-national and non-state actions is required to maintain a reasonable chance of meeting the target of keeping warming well below 2 degrees Celsius. The objective of the Paris climate agreement is to limit global-average temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to further pursue limiting it to 1.5 degrees Celsius; here, the adequacy of the national plans submitted in preparation for this agreement is assessed, and it is concluded that substantial enhancement or over-delivery on these plans is required to have a reasonable chance of achieving the Paris climate objective. The principal climate goal of the Paris Agreement of December 2015 is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. This Perspective assesses the national plans submitted to the Paris meeting for post-2020 action to reduce global greenhouse gas emission by 2030. It also provides projections for global mean temperature increase over the twenty-first century that would be consistent with the present national plans and discusses options that may help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to levels that are more consistent with maintaining a reasonable chance of meeting the well below 2 degrees Celsius climate target."

https://openalex.org/W2468773899,"Maladaptive aggressive behaviour is associated with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and is thought to result partly from the inappropriate activation of brain reward systems in response to aggressive or violent social stimuli. Nuclei within the ventromedial hypothalamus, extended amygdala and limbic circuits are known to encode initiation of aggression; however, little is known about the neural mechanisms that directly modulate the motivational component of aggressive behaviour. Here we established a mouse model to measure the valence of aggressive inter-male social interaction with a smaller subordinate intruder as reinforcement for the development of conditioned place preference (CPP). Aggressors develop a CPP, whereas non-aggressors develop a conditioned place aversion to the intruder-paired context. Furthermore, we identify a functional GABAergic projection from the basal forebrain (BF) to the lateral habenula (lHb) that bi-directionally controls the valence of aggressive interactions. Circuit-specific silencing of GABAergic BF-lHb terminals of aggressors with halorhodopsin (NpHR3.0) increases lHb neuronal firing and abolishes CPP to the intruder-paired context. Activation of GABAergic BF-lHb terminals of non-aggressors with channelrhodopsin (ChR2) decreases lHb neuronal firing and promotes CPP to the intruder-paired context. Finally, we show that altering inhibitory transmission at BF-lHb terminals does not control the initiation of aggressive behaviour. These results demonstrate that the BF-lHb circuit has a critical role in regulating the valence of inter-male aggressive behaviour and provide novel mechanistic insight into the neural circuits modulating aggression reward processing."
https://openalex.org/W2461068151,"Background Malnutrition in children under five years remains a significant problem in Bangladesh, despite substantial socio-economic progress and a decade of interventions aimed at improving it. Although several studies have been conducted to identify the important risk factors of malnutrition, none of them assess the role of low birth weight (LBW) despite its high prevalence (36%). This study examines the association between LBW and malnutrition using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2011 and provides practical guidelines for improving nutritional status of children. Methods Malnutrition in children is measured in terms of their height-for-age, weight-for-height, and weight-for-age. Children whose Z-scores for either of these indices are below two standard deviations (–2SD) from median of WHO’s reference population are considered as stunted, wasted or underweight, respectively. The association between malnutrition and LBW was investigated by calculating adjusted risk-ratio (RR), which controls for potential confounders such as child’s age and sex, mother’s education and height, length of preceding-birth-interval, access to food, area of residence, household socio-economic status. Adjusted RR was calculated using both Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach and multivariable logistic regression models controlling for confounder. Results The prevalence of malnutrition was markedly higher in children with LBW than those with normal birth-weights (stunting: 51% vs 39%; wasting: 25% vs 14% and underweight: 52% vs 33%). While controlling for the known risk factors, children with LBW had significantly increased risk of becoming malnourished compared to their counter part with RR 1.23 (95% CI:1.16–1.30), 1.71 (95% CI:1.53–1.92) and 1.47 (95% CI: 1.38–1.56) for stunting, wasting and underweight, respectively. The observed associations were not modified by factors known to reduce the prevalence of malnutrition, such as higher education of mother, better household socio-economic conditions and longer birth-interval. Conclusions Higher education of mother, better household socio-economic conditions and prolonged birth intervals alone are not sufficient in bringing about substantial reductions in prevalence of child malnutrition in Bangladesh. Targeted interventions should be designed to reduce prevalence of LBW in addition to improving mother’s education and other socio-demographic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2469454040,"In the last few years, the study of environmental DNA (eDNA) has drawn attention for many reasons, including its advantages for monitoring and conservation purposes. So far, in aquatic environments, most of eDNA research has focused on the detection of single species using species-specific markers. Recently, species inventories based on the analysis of a single generalist marker targeting a larger taxonomic group (eDNA metabarcoding) have proven useful for bony fish and amphibian biodiversity surveys. This approach involves in situ filtering of large volumes of water followed by amplification and sequencing of a short discriminative fragment from the 12S rDNA mitochondrial gene. In this study, we went one step further by investigating the spatial representativeness (i.e. ecological reliability and signal variability in space) of eDNA metabarcoding for large-scale fish biodiversity assessment in a freshwater system including lentic and lotic environments. We tested the ability of this approach to characterize large-scale organization of fish communities along a longitudinal gradient, from a lake to the outflowing river. First, our results confirm that eDNA metabarcoding is more efficient than a single traditional sampling campaign to detect species presence, especially in rivers. Second, the species list obtained using this approach is comparable to the one obtained when cumulating all traditional sampling sessions since 1995 and 1988 for the lake and the river, respectively. In conclusion, eDNA metabarcoding gives a faithful description of local fish biodiversity in the study system, more specifically within a range of a few kilometers along the river in our study conditions, i.e. longer than a traditional fish sampling site."
https://openalex.org/W2475326716,"In modern life petroleum-based plastic has become indispensable due to its frequent use as an easily available and a low cost packaging and moulding material. However, its rapidly growing use is causing aquatic and terrestrial pollution. Under these circumstances, research and development for biodegradable plastic (bioplastics) is inevitable. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a type of microbial polyester that accumulates as a carbon/energy storage material in various microorganisms can be a good alternative. In this study, 23 cyanobacterial strains (15 heterocystous and 8 non-heterocystous) were screened for PHB production. The highest PHB (6.44% w/w of dry cells) was detected in Nostoc muscorum NCCU- 442 and the lowest in Spirulina platensis NCCU-S5 (0.51% w/w of dry cells), whereas no PHB was found in Cylindrospermum sp., Oscillatoria sp. and Plectonema sp. Presence of PHB granules in Nostoc muscorum NCCU- 442 was confirmed microscopically with Sudan black B and Nile red A staining. Pretreatment of biomass with methanol: acetone: water: dimethylformamide [40: 40: 18: 2 (MAD-I)] with 2 h magnetic bar stirring followed by 30 h continuous chloroform soxhlet extraction acted as optimal extraction conditions. Optimized physicochemical conditions viz. 7.5 pH, 30°C temperature, 10:14 h light:dark periods with 0.4% glucose (as additional carbon source), 1.0 gl-1 sodium chloride and phosphorus deficiency yielded 26.37% PHB on 7th day instead of 21st day. Using FTIR, 1H NMR and GC-MS, extracted polymer was identified as PHB. Thermal properties (melting temperature, decomposition temperatures etc.) of the extracted polymer were determined by TGA and DSC. Further, the polymer showed good tensile strength and young's modulus with a low extension to break ratio comparable to petrochemical plastic. Biodegradability potential tested as weight loss percentage showed efficient degradation (24.58%) of PHB within 60 days by mixed microbial culture in comparison to petrochemical plastic."
https://openalex.org/W2466776079,"Non-photochemical quenching of excess excitation energy is an important photoprotective mechanism in photosynthetic organisms. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a high quenching capacity is constitutively present and depends on the PsbS protein. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, non-photochemical quenching becomes activated upon high light acclimation and requires the accumulation of light harvesting complex stress-related (LHCSR) proteins. Expression of the PsbS protein in C. reinhardtii has not been reported yet. Here, we show that PsbS is a light-induced protein in C. reinhardtii, whose accumulation under high light is further controlled by CO2 availability. PsbS accumulated after several hours of high light illumination at low CO2. At high CO2, however, PsbS was only transiently expressed under high light and was degraded after 1 h of high light exposure. PsbS accumulation correlated with an enhanced non-photochemical quenching capacity in high light-acclimated cells grown at low CO2. However, PsbS could not compensate for the function of LHCSR in an LHCSR-deficient mutant. Knockdown of PsbS accumulation led to reduction of both non-photochemical quenching capacity and LHCSR3 accumulation. Our data suggest that PsbS is essential for the activation of non-photochemical quenching in C. reinhardtii, possibly by promoting conformational changes required for activation of LHCSR3-dependent quenching in the antenna of photosystem II.

https://openalex.org/W2462362682,"Background [18F]THK5351, a recently-developed positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for measuring tau neurofibrillary tangle accumulation, may help researchers examine aging, disease, and tau pathology in living human brains. We examined THK5351 tracer pharmacokinetics to define an optimal acquisition time for static late images. Methods Primary measurements were calculation of regional values of distribution volume ratios (DVR) and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) in 6 healthy older control and 10 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) participants. We examined associations between DVR and SUVR, searching for a 20 min SUVR time window that was stable and comparable to DVR. We additionally examined diagnostic group differences in this 20 min SUVR. Results In healthy controls, [18F]THK5351 uptake was low, with increased temporal relative to frontal binding. In AD, regional uptake was substantially higher than in healthy controls, with temporal exceeding frontal binding. Retention in cerebellar gray matter, which was used as the reference region, was low compared to other regions. Both DVR and SUVR values showed minimal change over time after 40 min. SUVR 20–40, 30–50, and 40–60 min were most consistently correlated with DVR; SUVR 40–60 min, the most stable time window, was used in further analyses. Significant (AD > healthy control) group differences existed in temporoparietal regions, with marginal medial temporal differences. We found high basal ganglia SUVR 40–60 min signal, with no group differences. Conclusions We examined THK5351, a new PET tracer for measuring tau accumulation, and compared multiple analysis methods for quantifying regional tracer uptake. SUVR 40–60 min performed optimally when examining 20 min SUVR windows, and appears to be a practical method for quantifying relative regional tracer retention. The results of this study offer clinical potential, given the usefulness of THK5351-PET as a biomarker of tau pathology in aging and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2469597964,"Many organs are composed of complex tissue walls that are structurally organized to optimize organ function. In particular, the ventricular myocardial wall of the heart comprises an outer compact layer that concentrically encircles the ridge-like inner trabecular layer. Although disruption in the morphogenesis of this myocardial wall can lead to various forms of congenital heart disease and non-compaction cardiomyopathies, it remains unclear how embryonic cardiomyocytes assemble to form ventricular wall layers of appropriate spatial dimensions and myocardial mass. Here we use advanced genetic and imaging tools in zebrafish to reveal an interplay between myocardial Notch and Erbb2 signalling that directs the spatial allocation of myocardial cells to their proper morphological positions in the ventricular wall. Although previous studies have shown that endocardial Notch signalling non-cell-autonomously promotes myocardial trabeculation through Erbb2 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, we discover that distinct ventricular cardiomyocyte clusters exhibit myocardial Notch activity that cell-autonomously inhibits Erbb2 signalling and prevents cardiomyocyte sprouting and trabeculation. Myocardial-specific Notch inactivation leads to ventricles of reduced size and increased wall thickness because of excessive trabeculae, whereas widespread myocardial Notch activity results in ventricles of increased size with a single-cell-thick wall but no trabeculae. Notably, this myocardial Notch signalling is activated non-cell-autonomously by neighbouring Erbb2-activated cardiomyocytes that sprout and form nascent trabeculae. Thus, these findings support an interactive cellular feedback process that guides the assembly of cardiomyocytes to morphologically create the ventricular myocardial wall and more broadly provide insight into the cellular dynamics of how diverse cell lineages organize to create form."
https://openalex.org/W2474715567,"Switching of static friction and adhesion of a liquid drop on a corrugated solid boron nitride surface is linked to the intercalation of hydrogen, which changes the electric field of in-plane dipole rings and thus reduces the adsorption energy. Stiction, or static friction, is the force required to persuade an object to start sliding across a surface. It is technologically important in devices with moving parts in contact, but is not well understood. Stijn Mertens et al. describe an inorganic model system for the study of the relationships between surface wetting, stiction, adhesion and lubrication. The system is a hexagonal boron nitride monolayer that can be electrochemically switched by intercalation of hydrogen between a corrugated and a flat morphology. The change in the surface structure of the boron nitride alters the adhesion and its balance with stiction of an aqueous drop sliding across the monolayer. The work of adhesion increases in going from the flat to the corrugated surface, whereas the stiction threshold does not change significantly. Thus the authors make a quantitative connection between the macroscopic properties of stiction and adhesion as a result of structural control at the atomic scale. When a gecko moves on a ceiling it makes use of adhesion and stiction. Stiction—static friction—is experienced on microscopic and macroscopic scales and is related to adhesion and sliding friction1. Although important for most locomotive processes, the concepts of adhesion, stiction and sliding friction are often only empirically correlated. A more detailed understanding of these concepts will, for example, help to improve the design of increasingly smaller devices such as micro- and nanoelectromechanical switches2. Here we show how stiction and adhesion are related for a liquid drop on a hexagonal boron nitride monolayer on rhodium3, by measuring dynamic contact angles in two distinct states of the solid–liquid interface: a corrugated state in the absence of hydrogen intercalation and an intercalation-induced flat state. Stiction and adhesion can be reversibly switched by applying different electrochemical potentials to the sample, causing atomic hydrogen to be intercalated or not. We ascribe the change in adhesion to a change in lateral electric field of in-plane two-nanometre dipole rings4, because it cannot be explained by the change in surface roughness known from the Wenzel model5. Although the change in adhesion can be calculated for the system we study6, it is not yet possible to determine the stiction at such a solid–liquid interface using ab initio methods. The inorganic hybrid of hexagonal boron nitride and rhodium is very stable and represents a new class of switchable surfaces with the potential for application in the study of adhesion, friction and lubrication."
https://openalex.org/W2470243530,"The objective of this study was to identify genomic regions that are associated with meat quality traits in the Nellore breed. Nellore steers were finished in feedlots and slaughtered at a commercial slaughterhouse. This analysis included 1,822 phenotypic records of tenderness and 1,873 marbling records. After quality control, 1,630 animals genotyped for tenderness, 1,633 animals genotyped for marbling, and 369,722 SNPs remained. The results are reported as the proportion of variance explained by windows of 150 adjacent SNPs. Only windows with largest effects were considered. The genomic regions were located on chromosomes 5, 15, 16 and 25 for marbling and on chromosomes 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21 for tenderness. These windows explained 3,89% and 3,80% of the additive genetic variance for marbling and tenderness, respectively. The genes associated with the traits are related to growth, muscle development and lipid metabolism. The study of these genes in Nellore cattle is the first step in the identification of causal mutations that will contribute to the genetic evaluation of the breed."
https://openalex.org/W2466770606,"Macrophage CD36 binds and internalizes oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) to facilitate foam cell formation. CD36 expression is activated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Tamoxifen, an anti-breast cancer medicine, has demonstrated pleiotropic functions including cardioprotection with unfully elucidated mechanisms. In this study, we determined that treatment of ApoE-deficient mice with tamoxifen reduced atherosclerosis, which was associated with decreased CD36 and PPARγ expression in lesion areas. At the cellular level, we observed that tamoxifen inhibited CD36 protein expression in human THP-1 monocytes, THP-1/PMA macrophages, and human blood monocyte-derived macrophages. Associated with decreased CD36 protein expression, tamoxifen reduced cellular oxLDL accumulation in a CD36-dependent manner. At the transcriptional level, tamoxifen decreased CD36 mRNA expression, promoter activity, and the binding of the PPARγ response element in CD36 promoter to PPARγ protein. Tamoxifen blocked ligand-induced PPARγ nuclear translocation and CD36 expression, but it increased PPARγ phosphorylation, which was due to that tamoxifen-activated ERK1/2. Furthermore, deficiency of PPARγ expression in macrophages abolished the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on CD36 expression or cellular oxLDL accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our study demonstrates that tamoxifen inhibits CD36 expression and cellular oxLDL accumulation by inactivating the PPARγ signaling pathway, and the inhibition of macrophage CD36 expression can be attributed to the anti-atherogenic properties of tamoxifen."
https://openalex.org/W2468572787,"Although regenerative capacity is evident throughout the animal kingdom, it is not equally distributed throughout evolution. For instance, complex limb/appendage regeneration is muted in mammals but enhanced in amphibians and teleosts. The defining characteristic of limb/appendage regenerative systems is the formation of a dedifferentiated tissue, termed blastema, which serves as the progenitor reservoir for regenerating tissues. In order to identify a genetic signature that accompanies blastema formation, we employ next-generation sequencing to identify shared, differentially regulated mRNAs and noncoding RNAs in three different, highly regenerative animal systems: zebrafish caudal fins, bichir pectoral fins and axolotl forelimbs.These studies identified a core group of 5 microRNAs (miRNAs) that were commonly upregulated and 5 miRNAs that were commonly downregulated, as well as 4 novel tRNAs fragments with sequences conserved with humans. To understand the potential function of these miRNAs, we built a network of 1,550 commonly differentially expressed mRNAs that had functional relationships to 11 orthologous blastema-associated genes. As miR-21 was the most highly upregulated and most highly expressed miRNA in all three models, we validated the expression of known target genes, including the tumor suppressor, pdcd4, and TGFβ receptor subunit, tgfbr2 and novel putative target genes such as the anti-apoptotic factor, bcl2l13, Choline kinase alpha, chka and the regulator of G-protein signaling, rgs5.Our extensive analysis of RNA-seq transcriptome profiling studies in three regenerative animal models, that diverged in evolution ~420 million years ago, reveals a common miRNA-regulated genetic network of blastema genes. These comparative studies extend our current understanding of limb/appendage regeneration by identifying previously unassociated blastema genes and the extensive regulation by miRNAs, which could serve as a foundation for future functional studies to examine the process of natural cellular reprogramming in an injury context."
https://openalex.org/W2468369126,"A small portion of cellular glycogen is transported to and degraded in lysosomes by acid α-glucosidase (GAA) in mammals, but it is unclear why and how glycogen is transported to the lysosomes. Stbd1 has recently been proposed to participate in glycogen trafficking to lysosomes. However, our previous study demonstrated that knockdown of Stbd1 in GAA knock-out mice did not alter lysosomal glycogen storage in skeletal muscles. To further determine whether Stbd1 participates in glycogen transport to lysosomes, we generated GAA/Stbd1 double knock-out mice. In fasted double knock-out mice, glycogen accumulation in skeletal and cardiac muscles was not affected, but glycogen content in liver was reduced by nearly 73% at 3 months of age and by 60% at 13 months as compared with GAA knock-out mice, indicating that the transport of glycogen to lysosomes was suppressed in liver by the loss of Stbd1. Exogenous expression of human Stbd1 in double knock-out mice restored the liver lysosomal glycogen content to the level of GAA knock-out mice, as did a mutant lacking the Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) and another mutant that contains only the N-terminal 24 hydrophobic segment and the C-terminal starch binding domain (CBM20) interlinked by an HA tag.

The observation that it binds to glycogen and interacts with the autophagy protein GABARAPL1 in cultured cells led to speculations that Stbd1 may function as a cargo-binding protein that delivers glycogen to lysosomes in a specific autophagic pathway (13.Jiang S.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 413: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Contradictorily, our previous study undermined this proposition, as significant knockdown of Stbd1 in skeletal muscle of GAA knock-out (GKO) mice did not affect lysosomal glycogen storage in the tissue (16.Yi H. Fredrickson K.B. Das S. Kishnani P.S. Sun B. et al.Stbd1 is highly elevated in skeletal muscle of Pompe disease mice but suppression of its expression does not affect lysosomal glycogen accumulation.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2013; 109: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated Stbd1/GAA double knock-out (dKO) mice to explore the role of Stbd1 in glycogen transport to lysosomes, as accumulated lysosomal glycogen is an easily measurable indicator of glycogen transport to this organelle. The lack of GAA in GKO and dKO mice enables us to monitor glycogen transport to lysosomes, because the glycogen cannot be degraded once inside lysosomes and glycogen build-up/storage can be readily observed/quantified. To assess whether the loss of Stbd1 affects glycogen transport to lysosomes, 3-month-old male GKO and dKO mice were subjected to overnight fasting and glycogen contents were measured in different tissues. Age- and gender-matched Stbd1 knock-out (SKO) mice and their littermate WT mice were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 1A, both SKO and WT mice had very low levels of glycogen in heart, skeletal, and liver tissues. The GKO mice showed high levels of lysosomal glycogen storage in these tissues as seen in the GAA knock-out (6neo/6neo) mice (17.Raben N. Nagaraju K. Lee E. Kessler P. Byrne B. Lee L. LaMarca M. King C. Ward J. Sauer B. Plotz P. et al.Targeted disruption of the acid α-glucosidase gene in mice causes an illness with critical features of both infantile and adult human glycogen storage disease type II.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19086-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). There were no significant differences in glycogen contents in cardiac and skeletal muscles between the dKO mice and GKO mice. Surprisingly, liver glycogen content in the dKO mice (11.8 ± 3.9 μmol of glucose/g) was only 27% of that in the GKO mice (43.7 ± 4.6 μmol of glucose/g). Consistent with this result, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of liver sections showed strong glycogen staining in the GKO mice and markedly weaker staining in the dKO mice. No obvious PAS-positive glycogen was observed in the livers of WT and SKO mice (Fig. 1B). Our data indicate that Stbd1 plays a significant role in glycogen transport to the lysosomes in liver, but not in skeletal muscle and heart. The fact that liver glycogen level in dKO mice was still significantly higher than in WT (Fig. 1, A and B) indicates that a small amount of glycogen was still transported to lysosomes in the absence of Stbd1. To determine the impact of the Stbd1-independent pathway(s) on lysosomal glycogen accumulation over time, we examined liver glycogen levels in old dKO mice at 13 months of age. As shown in Fig. 1C, fasting liver glycogen content in the 13-month-old dKO mice (20.0 ± 5.8 μmol of glucose/g) was significantly higher than that of the 3-month-old dKO mice (11.8 ± 3.9 μmol of glucose/g), but it was still far below the level in age-matched GKO mice (50.6 ± 8.1 μmol of glucose/g). This demonstrates that other minor routes may have limited contribution to the transport of glycogen into lysosomes, and the Stbd1-mediated pathway plays a dominant role in this process. To exclude the possibility that the reduced lysosomal glycogen accumulation in dKO mouse liver was due to suppression of glycogen synthesis in the absence of Stbd1, we compared liver glycogen contents in WT, GKO, and dKO mice at 3 months of age at fed state. No significant difference in liver glycogen contents was found among these genotypes (Fig. 1D). Glycogen level in GKO mice was seemingly higher, possibly due to an extra glycogen pool trapped in the lysosomes. We also examined the expression of the two key enzymes for glycogen synthesis, glycogen synthase 2 (GS2) and glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1). There was no difference in expression of either enzyme between GKO and dKO livers as determined by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, Stbd1 knock-out does not affect liver glycogen synthesis. Stbd1 has an N-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region, a putative leucine zipper, an identified AIM, and a CBM20 (13.Jiang S. Heller B. Tagliabracci V.S. Zhai L. Irimia J.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Wells C.D. Skurat A.V.

Cheng A. et al.The carbohydrate-binding domain of overexpressed STBD1 is important for its stability and protein-protein interactions.Biosci. Rep. 2014; 34: e00117Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To determine critical elements in Stbd1 for glycogen transport to lysosomes, we constructed a series of AAV vectors to express WT human Stbd1 and its mutants in dKO mice (Fig. 2A). AAV transduction efficiencies for all constructs are comparable as real-time PCR results revealed similar viral copy numbers in livers of AAV-injected dKO mice (supplemental Fig. S2). Western blots demonstrated that the AAV vectors expressed GFP (negative control), Stbd1, and its mutants in the liver of injected dKO mice (Fig. 2B). Protein level of the ΔN24 mutant was extremely low and only weakly detectable with longer exposure, possibly due to the instability of this mutant protein in liver cells (Fig. 2B). Exogenous expression of human Stbd1 restored glycogen transport to lysosome in liver as indicated by the rebound of liver glycogen storage in the treated dKO mice to a similar level as GKO mice (Fig. 2C). This confirms that the much lower liver lysosomal glycogen storage in dKO mice was a direct result of Stbd1 knock-out. To test whether the interaction between Stbd1 and GABARAPL1 is required for glycogen transport to lysosomes, we generated an AIM mutant, AIMm (W203A/V206A; Fig. 2A), that loses the GABARAPL1 binding ability (14.Jiang S. Wells C.D. Roach P.J. et al.Starch-binding domain-containing protein 1 (Stbd1) and glycogen metabolism: identification of the Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) in Stbd1 required for interaction with GABARAPL1.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 413: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The AIMm mutant restored lysosomal glycogen storage in liver as potently as wild-type Stbd1 (Fig. 2C). This indicates that the Stbd1-GABARAPL1 interaction is not required for glycogen transport to lysosome in liver. The ΔN24 mutant failed to restore glycogen storage in liver (Fig. 2C). However, the extremely low expression level of this mutant prevents us from drawing a conclusion on the necessity of the N terminus in glycogen transport. It seems that this N-terminal transmembrane region is important for the stability of the protein in liver, because the same construct could express the protein in amounts comparable with other constructs in 293T cells (data not shown). Lastly, we constructed a mutant (Δ26–259) that contains only the N-terminal transmembrane region and the C-terminal CBM20 domain linked by an HA tag (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, this mutant functioned as potently as the full-length Stbd1 to restore lysosomal glycogen storage in the liver of dKO mice (Fig. 2C). This demonstrated that the intervening region (amino acids 26–259) is dispensable for glycogen transport to lysosomes in liver. Autophagy has been shown to be involved in glycogen trafficking to lysosomes in fast-twitch skeletal muscle (12.Raben N. Schreiner C. Baum R. Takikita S. Xu S. Xie T. Myerowitz R. Komatsu M. Van der Meulen J.H. Nagaraju K. Ralston E. Plotz P.H. et al.Suppression of autophagy permits successful enzyme replacement therapy in a lysosomal storage disorder—murine Pompe disease.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 1078-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To check whether the loss of Stbd1 affects autophagy activation in liver, we checked the autophagy marker LC3 in dKO and GKO mice under both fed and fasted conditions. As shown in Fig. 2D, LC3-II level in fasted liver was dramatically higher than that in fed liver of both GKO and dKO mice, indicating the induction of autophagy by fasting in both genotypes. In other words, the activation of autophagy was not blocked by the Stbd1 knock-out. In addition, there was no obvious difference in expression of other autophagy-related genes such as P62, Beclin 1, and Atg8L1 in fasted livers between the dKO and GKO mice (supplemental Fig. S1). On the other hand, fasting-induced activation of autophagy in liver was not accompanied by an obvious change in the level of Stbd1 protein in GKO mice (Fig. 2D). Our results suggest that loss of Stbd1 does not affect conventional autophagy in liver. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Stbd1 plays a dominant role in transporting glycogen to lysosomes in liver, and that the N-terminal transmembrane region and the C-terminal CBM20 domain are critical in this process. Cellular glycogen is mostly degraded in the cytoplasm, but a small portion is transported into the lysosomes and hydrolyzed by GAA (1.Geddes R.

Understanding the mechanism of how glycogen is transported into lysosomes is a critical step for the exploration of new therapeutic targets for Pompe disease considering the significant limitations of enzyme replacement therapy (7.Kishnani P.S.

It has been demonstrated that autophagy plays a partial role in the transport of glycogen to lysosomes in skeletal muscle of GAA-KO mice (12.Raben N. Schreiner C. Baum R. Takikita S. Xu S. Xie T. Myerowitz R. Komatsu M. Van der Meulen J.H. Nagaraju K. Ralston E.

Recent studies led to a proposition that Stbd1 functions as a cargo receptor for delivery of glycogen to lysosomes in a specific autophagic pathway (termed “glycophagy”), and the interactions between Stbd1 and GABARAPL1 might be critical in this process (13.Jiang S. Heller B. Tagliabracci V.S. Zhai L. Irimia J.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Wells C.D. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. et al.Starch binding domain-containing protein 1/genethonin 1 is a novel participant in glycogen metabolism.J. Biol.

Roach P.J. et al.Starch-binding domain-containing protein 1 (Stbd1) and glycogen metabolism: identification of the Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) in Stbd1 required for interaction with GABARAPL1.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 413: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This provoked a great expectation that Stbd1 might be a new therapeutic target for Pompe disease. Contradictorily, our previous study demonstrated that significant knockdown of Stbd1 in skeletal muscle of GAA knock-out mice did not reduce lysosomal glycogen accumulation, suggesting that Stbd1 may not be involved in lysosomal glycogen trafficking at least in this tissue (16.Yi H. Fredrickson K.B. Das S. Kishnani P.S. Sun B. et al.Stbd1 is highly elevated in skeletal muscle of Pompe disease mice but suppression of its expression does not affect lysosomal glycogen accumulation.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2013; 109: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In an effort to clarify this controversy, we generated Stbd1/GAA double knock-out mice. These mice serve as an ideal system for investigating the role of Stbd1 in transporting glycogen into lysosomes in various tissues because glycogen accumulation due to the lack of GAA is a reliable and quantifiable indicator of glycogen transport into lysosomes. In agreement with our previous study (16.Yi H. Fredrickson K.B. Das S. Kishnani P.S. Sun B. et al.Stbd1 is highly elevated in skeletal muscle of Pompe disease mice but suppression of its expression does not affect lysosomal glycogen accumulation.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2013; 109: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we found that loss of Stbd1 in dKO mice did not affect lysosomal glycogen accumulation in cardiac and skeletal muscles (Fig. 1A), indicating that Stbd1 may not be involved in glycogen transport to lysosomes in these tissues. However, strikingly, we found that lysosomal glycogen storage in the liver of dKO mice was 73% lower than that of the GKO mice, suggesting that Stbd1 is a major but not the sole mediator for glycogen transport into lysosomes. Similar to our findings of Stbd1's function in liver, Raben et al. (12.Raben N. Schreiner C. Baum R. Takikita S. Xu S. Xie T. Myerowitz R. Komatsu M. Van der Meulen J.H. Nagaraju K. Ralston E. Plotz P.H. et al.Suppression of autophagy permits successful enzyme replacement therapy in a lysosomal storage disorder—murine Pompe disease.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 1078-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrated that autophagy plays a critical role in muscle in transporting glycogen to lysosomes. They reported that suppression of autophagy reduced lysosomal glycogen content by 50–60% in skeletal muscles of GAA-KO mice. These results demonstrate that different tissues could have distinct major pathways for glycogen transport to lysosomes, and in the same tissue multiple routes exist. Because liver and muscle are very different in terms of the regulation of glycogen metabolism and the utilization of glycogen storage (3.Adeva-Andany M.M. González-Lucán M. Donapetry-García C. Fernández-Fernández C. Ameneiros-Rodríguez E. et al.Glycogen metabolism in humans.BBA Clin. 2016; 5: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that different pathways play major roles in transporting glycogen to lysosomes in the two tissues. Although our data clearly demonstrated that Stbd1 plays a dominant role in glycogen transport to lysosomes in liver, we cannot exclude the possibility that it may play a minor role in muscle. Stbd1 knock-out did not block the activation of autophagy in liver, as a similar elevation of LC3-II abundance was observed in the GKO and dKO mice under fasting conditions (Fig. 2D), and had no effect on the expression of autophagy-related proteins P62, Beclin1, and GABARAPL1 (supplemental Fig. S1). On the other hand, fasting-induced activation of autophagy in GKO liver was not accompanied by apparent change in the level of Stbd1 protein (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the reduced lysosomal glycogen accumulation in dKO mouse liver was not due to blockage of the conventional autophagy. Whether the conventional autophagy contributed to the transport of the small amount of lysosomal glycogen in the dKO liver, in the absence of Stbd1, remained undetermined. The Stbd1-GABARAPL1 interaction is not required for Stbd1-mediated glycogen transport to lysosome because the Stbd1 mutant with the GABARAPL1 binding motif mutation (AIMm) was able to replenish the lysosomal glycogen content in the liver of dKO mice (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the mutant missing the entire intervening region (Δ26–259) also successfully restored the liver lysosomal glycogen content in dKO mice (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that only the N-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region and the C-terminal CBM20 are critical for carrying out this function. Our data support the notion that Stbd1 may function as an anchor to bring glycogen to an intracellular membrane (13.Jiang S. Heller B. Tagliabracci V.S. Zhai L. Irimia J.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Wells C.D. Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. et al.Starch binding domain-containing protein 1/genethonin 1 is a novel participant in glycogen metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34960-34971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). GABARAPL1 is implicated in several different cellular processes including autophagy and is the most highly expressed gene in the central nervous system among the GABARAP family members (19.Le Grand J.N.

This Stbd1-GABARAPL1 interaction may play important roles in other tissues, especially the central nervous system. This is the first study to demonstrate the function of Stbd1 in mice. Our results demonstrate that Stbd1 dominates glycogen transport to lysosomes in liver, but not in muscles. It would be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms by which Stbd1 participates in this process. As Stbd1 is also highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, it would be interesting to uncover the function of this protein in these tissues. Our study suggests that the mechanism of glycogen transport to lysosomes in liver is distinct from that in muscles, and thus different treatment schemes might be developed for different target tissues in Pompe disease.

https://openalex.org/W2461586026,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a serious and highly prevalent condition that remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Previous work found that skeletal muscle atrophy involves an increase in skeletal muscle Gadd45a expression, which is necessary and sufficient for skeletal muscle fiber atrophy. However, the direct mechanism by which Gadd45a promotes skeletal muscle atrophy was unknown. To address this question, we biochemically isolated skeletal muscle proteins that associate with Gadd45a as it induces atrophy in mouse skeletal muscle fibers in vivo. We found that Gadd45a interacts with multiple proteins in skeletal muscle fibers, including, most prominently, MEKK4, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that was not previously known to play a role in skeletal muscle atrophy. Furthermore, we found that, by forming a complex with MEKK4 in skeletal muscle fibers, Gadd45a increases MEKK4 protein kinase activity, which is both sufficient to induce skeletal muscle fiber atrophy and required for Gadd45a-mediated skeletal muscle fiber atrophy. Together, these results identify a direct biochemical mechanism by which Gadd45a induces skeletal muscle atrophy and provide new insight into the way that skeletal muscle atrophy occurs at the molecular level. Skeletal muscle atrophy is a serious and highly prevalent condition that remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Previous work found that skeletal muscle atrophy involves an increase in skeletal muscle Gadd45a expression, which is necessary and sufficient for skeletal muscle fiber atrophy. However, the direct mechanism by which Gadd45a promotes skeletal muscle atrophy was unknown. To address this question, we biochemically isolated skeletal muscle proteins that associate with Gadd45a as it induces atrophy in mouse skeletal muscle fibers in vivo. We found that Gadd45a interacts with multiple proteins in skeletal muscle fibers, including, most prominently, MEKK4, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that was not previously known to play a role in skeletal muscle atrophy. Furthermore, we found that, by forming a complex with MEKK4 in skeletal muscle fibers, Gadd45a increases MEKK4 protein kinase activity, which is both sufficient to induce skeletal muscle fiber atrophy and required for Gadd45a-mediated skeletal muscle fiber atrophy. Together, these results identify a direct biochemical mechanism by which Gadd45a induces skeletal muscle atrophy and provide new insight into the way that skeletal muscle atrophy occurs at the molecular level. Skeletal muscle wasting, or atrophy, occurs in many people as they become older, experience muscle disuse, and/or suffer from malnutrition, critical illness, or advanced chronic illness. At the cellular level, skeletal muscle atrophy is explained by a reduction in the size of skeletal muscle fibers. At the molecular level, skeletal muscle atrophy is highly complex, poorly understood, and still largely unexplored. Over the past several years, a few proteins have emerged as important mediators of skeletal muscle atrophy, and one of these proteins is called growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45α or Gadd45a (1Ebert S.M.

Gadd45a is a soluble, primarily nuclear 18-kDa protein with no known enzymatic activity (2Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Gadd45 modulation of intrinsic and extrinsic stress responses in myeloid cells.J.

However, a variety of stress conditions that cause skeletal muscle atrophy (i.e. aging, muscle disuse, starvation, and severe illness) activate certain transcription regulators within skeletal muscle fibers (ATF4, HDAC4, and/or FoxOs, depending on the stress) that strongly induce the Gadd45a gene (1Ebert S.M.

Importantly, the induction of skeletal muscle Gadd45a expression is required for skeletal muscle fiber atrophy during at least some stress conditions (e.g. starvation, limb immobilization, and muscle denervation (1Ebert S.M. Dyle M.C. Kunkel S.D. Bullard S.A. Bongers K.S. Fox D.K. Dierdorff J.M. Foster E.D. Adams C.M. Stress-induced skeletal muscle Gadd45a expression reprograms myonuclei and causes muscle atrophy.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 27290-27301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, forced expression of Gadd45a is sufficient to induce skeletal muscle fiber atrophy in the absence of an upstream stress (1Ebert S.M. Dyle M.C. Kunkel S.D. Bullard S.A. Bongers K.S. Fox D.K. Dierdorff J.M. Foster E.D. Adams C.M. Stress-induced skeletal muscle Gadd45a expression reprograms myonuclei and causes muscle atrophy.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 27290-27301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, previous findings demonstrated a key role for Gadd45a in skeletal muscle atrophy. However, the direct mechanism by which Gadd45a causes muscle atrophy is not known. This represents an important gap in our current understanding of skeletal muscle atrophy. In addition to its role in skeletal muscle atrophy, Gadd45a mediates stress responses in other cell types (2Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Gadd45 modulation of intrinsic and extrinsic stress responses in myeloid cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 218: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 3Salvador J.M. Brown-Clay J.D. Fornace Jr., A.J. Gadd45 in stress signaling, cell cycle control, and apoptosis.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2013; 793: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Similar to the situation in skeletal muscle, Gadd45a expression is typically very low when cells are healthy, but it rises dramatically when cells are exposed to a variety of stress conditions. In non-muscle cells, Gadd45a controls stress responses by directly interacting with other proteins to modify their function. Depending on the specific context (cell type, stress, etc.), Gadd45a may bind and regulate certain protein kinases, nucleotide excision repair proteins, base excision repair proteins, nuclear hormone receptors, and/or cell cycle regulators (2Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Gadd45 modulation of intrinsic and extrinsic stress responses in myeloid cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 218: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 3Salvador J.M.

Active DNA demethylation by Gadd45 and DNA repair.Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22: 220-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These interactions between Gadd45a and its target proteins lead to context-specific cellular responses, which may include growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, active DNA demethylation, apoptosis, or cellular senescence. Proteins that interact with Gadd45a in skeletal muscle have not been identified. However, drawing upon findings from other cell types, we hypothesized that Gadd45a might cause skeletal muscle atrophy by directly binding and regulating another protein in skeletal muscle fibers. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an unbiased search for proteins that interact with Gadd45a in mouse skeletal muscle fibers in vivo. A previously published NMR analysis of Gadd45a revealed a globular protein with a disordered flexible region at its N terminus (19Sánchez R. Pantoja-Uceda D. Prieto J. Diercks T. Marcaida M.J. Montoya G. Campos-Olivas R. Blanco F.J. Solution structure of human growth arrest and DNA damage 45α (Gadd45α) and its interactions with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Aurora A kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22196-22201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To develop a Gadd45a construct suitable for tandem affinity purification (TAP), 2The abbreviations used are:TAPtandem affinity purificationTAtibialis anterioreGFPenhanced GFPEmGFPemerald GFPBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolMAPmitogen-activated proteinFDRfalse discovery rate. we placed two affinity tags (FLAG and S-tag) at the N terminus of Gadd45a, generating a protein that we termed Gadd45a TAP (Fig. 1A). To confirm that the affinity tags in Gadd45a TAP did not interfere with Gadd45a-mediated skeletal muscle atrophy, we transfected a plasmid encoding Gadd45a TAP into the tibialis anterior (TA) skeletal muscles of living mice. In each mouse, the contralateral TA muscle was transfected with empty plasmid and served as an intrasubject control. To detect transfected muscle fibers, bilateral TA muscles were co-transfected with plasmid-encoding eGFP, a transfection marker that does not alter skeletal muscle fiber size. It is important to note that in vivo electroporation transfects differentiated muscle fibers, but not satellite cells or connective tissue cells (20Sartori R. Milan G. Patron M. Mammucari C. Blaauw B. Abraham R. Sandri M. Smad2 and 3 transcription factors control muscle mass in adulthood.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C1248-C1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Seven days after skeletal muscle fiber transfection, we euthanized the mice and harvested bilateral TA muscles for biochemical and histological analyses. As expected, transfection of the Gadd45a TAP plasmid generated an ≈30-kDa Gadd45a TAP protein in mouse skeletal muscle (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, Gadd45a TAP significantly reduced skeletal muscle fiber size (Fig. 1, C–E), indicating that Gadd45a TAP induces skeletal muscle fiber atrophy in vivo, similar to untagged Gadd45a. tandem affinity purification tibialis anterior enhanced GFP emerald GFP 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol mitogen-activated protein false discovery rate. To discover proteins that interact with Gadd45a during skeletal muscle atrophy, we performed a larger scale experiment that is illustrated in Fig. 2. We began by transfecting the TA muscle fibers of 48 mice. In each mouse, one TA was transfected with empty plasmid and the other TA was transfected with Gadd45a TAP plasmid. Ten days after transfection, we euthanized the mice and harvested bilateral TA muscles from each mouse. We then prepared and pooled protein extracts from each of the two groups of skeletal muscles (control and Gadd45a) and subjected both pooled protein extracts to sequential purification steps with anti-FLAG magnetic beads and S-protein-agarose. A small aliquot of each final pulldown sample was visualized by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, and the remaining portions of control and Gadd45a pulldown samples were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. SDS-PAGE and silver staining revealed multiple proteins that were present in the Gadd45a pulldown sample but absent in the control sample (Fig. 2). Using mass spectrometry, we identified 209 proteins in the Gadd45a pulldown sample and 29 proteins in the control sample (supplemental Table 1). To begin to differentiate bona fide Gadd45a-interacting proteins from nonspecific interactors, we estimated protein abundance via spectral counting and weighted spectral counting (weighted spectral counting normalizes mass spectrometric signal to the size of the protein). The data indicated the following: 1) the vast majority of identified proteins were exclusively found in the Gadd45a pulldown sample; 2) most of the proteins that were found in both Gadd45a and control pulldown samples possessed much higher spectral counts in the Gadd45a sample compared with the control sample; and 3) many of the proteins identified in the control sample were actually present at only very low abundance (i.e. noise) levels in that sample (supplemental Table 1). As expected, the most abundant protein in the Gadd45a pulldown sample, based on weighted spectral counting, was Gadd45a TAP itself (Fig. 3A and supplemental Tables 1–4). Gadd45a TAP was also the most abundant protein in the Gadd45a pulldown sample on the silver-stained gel (Fig. 2). To identify potential nonspecific interactors in the Gadd45a pulldown sample, we applied a series of three filters to the mass spectrometric data. First, we used weighted spectral counting to estimate differences in protein abundance between the control and Gadd45a pulldown samples. This method indicated that 20 of the proteins identified in the control sample were not significantly (30-fold) enriched in the Gadd45a sample (i.e. Gadd45a/control spectral count ratio was <30). Those 20 proteins clearly appeared to be nonspecific interactors, and thus we chose to exclude them from further consideration (Fig. 2; supplemental Table 2). Our second filter was based upon a previous study that defined some common affinity purification contaminants (21Mellacheruvu D. Wright Z. Couzens A.L. Lambert J.P. St-Denis N.A. Li T. Miteva Y.V. Hauri S. Sardiu M.E. Low T.Y. Halim V.A. Bagshaw R.D. Hubner N.C. Al-Hakim A. Bouchard A. et al.The CRAPome: a contaminant repository for affinity purification-mass spectrometry data.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). We identified 19 of those common contaminants in the Gadd45a pulldown sample, as well as 17 proteins that are closely related to the common contaminants (e.g. other heat shock proteins and proteosome subunits). We deemed these 36 proteins probable nonspecific interactors and set them aside from further consideration (Fig. 2; supplemental Table 3). Our final filter was based upon a recent deep proteomics study that estimated the relative abundance of 8309 proteins that are detectable by mass spectrometry in healthy mouse triceps skeletal muscle (22Deshmukh A.S. Murgia M. Nagaraj N. Treebak J.T. Cox J. Mann M. Deep proteomics of mouse skeletal muscle enables quantitation of protein isoforms, metabolic pathways, and transcription factors.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2015; 14: 841-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We reasoned that abundant skeletal muscle proteins were more likely to interact non-specifically with Gadd45a, and thus, we chose to exclude any proteins in the Gadd45a pulldown sample that, on an individual basis, comprised >0.01% of total skeletal muscle protein. In addition, we excluded paralogs of abundant skeletal muscle proteins found in the Gadd45a pulldown sample (e.g. other actins and tubulins). This third filter set aside an additional 78 proteins, leaving a stringently defined group of 75 proteins, composed of Gadd45a itself plus 74 low abundance skeletal muscle proteins that appear to specifically interact, directly or indirectly, with Gadd45a in vivo (Fig. 2; supplemental Table 4). Interestingly, of the 74 proteins identified through this workflow, 13 (≈18%) are protein kinases (Fig. 2; supplemental Table 4). These 13 protein kinases, in order of highest to lowest abundance in the Gadd45a pulldown sample, are MEKK4 (also known as MAP3K4 and MTK1), MKK3 (also known as MAP2K3), JAK1, Raf-1, A-Raf, ILK, RSK2, MSK2, MSK1, MKK6 (MAP2K6), RIPK3, MKK7 (MAP2K7), and RIO kinase 3. Fig. 3A summarizes the mass spectroscopic data for Gadd45a and associated protein kinases in the Gadd45a pulldown sample. Of note, for three of these kinases, only one unique peptide was identified in the Gadd45a pulldown sample; however, because those kinases are very rare in skeletal muscle (representing <0.001% of total skeletal muscle protein (22Deshmukh A.S. Murgia M. Nagaraj N. Treebak J.T. Cox J. Mann M. Deep proteomics of mouse skeletal muscle enables quantitation of protein isoforms, metabolic pathways, and transcription factors.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2015; 14: 841-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)), we suspect they may specifically interact with Gadd45a, albeit at low levels. Our overall goal in this study was to discover a direct protein target of Gadd45a that causes skeletal muscle atrophy. The data from our Gadd45a pulldown experiment suggested that Gadd45a may cause skeletal muscle atrophy via interactions with multiple skeletal muscle proteins. Because it was not feasible to investigate all potential Gadd45a targets in the current study, we focused our attention on one, MEKK4. Altogether, in the Gadd45a pulldown sample, we identified 62 unique tryptic peptides covering 41% of the 180-kDa MEKK4 amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A). To obtain a more thorough quantitative assessment, we used MS1 filtering (23Schilling B. Rardin M.J. MacLean B.X. Zawadzka A.M. Frewen B.E. Cusack M.P. Sorensen D.J. Bereman M.S. Jing E. Wu C.C.

Skyline: an open source document editor for creating and analyzing targeted proteomics experiments.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 966-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar)) to quantify differences in protein abundance between the control and Gadd45a pulldown samples (supplemental Tables 5 and 6). Fig. 3B shows raw data from one representative MEKK4 peptide that was enriched ≈31-fold in the Gadd45a pulldown sample relative to the control pulldown sample (Fig. 3B, left and middle panels), as well as three technical replicates of those data (Fig. 3B, right panel). Other than Gadd45a itself, MEKK4 was the most abundant protein in the Gadd45a pulldown sample based on weighted spectral counting, and when signals were not normalized for protein size, MEKK4 generated the highest ranking overall search score of any protein in the Gadd45a pulldown sample (Fig. 3A). MEKK4 is a relatively understudied protein in the MAP kinase kinase kinase family. Its role in skeletal muscle had not been previously investigated. However, an elegant series of studies conducted by Saito and co-workers (25Takekawa M. Saito H.

To briefly summarize those studies, Saito and co-workers (25Takekawa M. Saito H. A family of stress-inducible GADD45-like proteins mediate activation of the stress-responsive MTK1/MEKK4 MAPKKK.Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 26Mita H.

Biol. 2007; 27: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) found that the kinase domain of MEKK4 resides at the C terminus of the protein; the N-terminal portion of MEKK4 contains an autoinhibitory domain and a Gadd45a-binding site. Under basal conditions, when Gadd45a is not present, MEKK4 exists in an inactive conformation, with its autoinhibitory domain bound to its kinase domain. However, when Gadd45a is present, it directly binds MEKK4 and forces a conformational change that dissociates the autoinhibitory and kinase domains of MEKK4. As a result of this conformational change, the MEKK4 kinase domain becomes active; a specific residue in the MEKK4 kinase activation loop (threonine 1483) is autophosphorylated; and MEKK4 gains the capacity to phosphorylate/activate certain downstream protein kinases, which are currently defined as the MAP kinase kinases MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, and MKK7 (28Bettinger B.T. Amberg D.C. The MEK kinases MEKK4/Ssk2p facilitate complexity in the stress signaling responses of diverse systems.J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two pieces of mass spectrometric data from our Gadd45a pulldown sample indicated that Gadd45a not only interacted with MEKK4 but also activated it. First, several MEKK4 peptides were phosphorylated, at serine 116, serine 492, serine 1241, and most importantly, at threonine 1483, the autophosphorylation site in the MEKK4 kinase activation loop (supplemental Files 1–5). Fig. 3C shows the tandem mass spectra of a phosphopeptide containing phosphothreonine 1483 in the Gadd45a pulldown sample, and Fig. 3D illustrates the location of threonine 1483 within the activation loop of MEKK4. Second, Gadd45a, presumably via MEKK4, interacted with three established MEKK4 substrates, MKK3, MKK6, and MKK7 (Fig. 3A). These data strongly suggested that Gadd45a activated MEKK4 in skeletal muscle fibers, consistent with the findings of Saito and co-workers (25Takekawa M. Saito H. A family of stress-inducible GADD45-like proteins mediate activation of the stress-responsive MTK1/MEKK4 MAPKKK.Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 26Mita H.

Biol. 2007; 27: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) in cultured cell models. To further investigate whether Gadd45a activates MEKK4 in skeletal muscle, we performed an independent experiment in which we transfected mouse TA muscle fibers in vivo with empty plasmid (one TA) or plasmid encoding Gadd45a (contralateral TA). Seven days after transfection, we assessed phosphorylation (i.e. activation) of the MEKK4 targets MKK3, MKK6, and MKK4. Of note, the antibody used to detect phosphorylation of MKK3 and MKK6 did not distinguish between MKK3 and MKK6, and we could not assess MEKK4 or MKK7 by immunoblot analysis due to a lack of quality antibodies. Under control conditions, MKK3/6 and MKK4 were minimally phosphorylated (Fig. 4A). However, in the presence of Gadd45a, MKK3/6 and MKK4 phosphorylation was markedly increased (Fig. 4A). Moreover, Gadd45a-mediated activation of MKK3/6 and MKK4 was accompanied by increased phosphorylation (i.e. activation) of p38, a MAP kinase that lies directly downstream of MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6 (Fig. 4A). Gadd45a did not affect total levels of MKK3, MKK6, MKK4, or p38, and we did not detect any effects of Gadd45a on the phosphorylation status of JNK and ERK MAP kinases (Fig. 4A). Thus, in skeletal muscle, Gadd45a activated certain protein kinases that are known to lie downstream of the Gadd45a-MEKK4 complex, namely MKK3/6, MKK4, and p38. To determine whether MEKK4 is required for Gadd45a-mediated activation of MKK3/6, MKK4, and p38, we developed an RNA interference (RNAi) construct that specifically reduces MEKK4 protein in mouse skeletal muscle in vivo (MEKK4 RNAi; Fig. 4B). We then transfected mouse TA muscle fibers in vivo with plasmid encoding Gadd45a plus plasmids encoding either a nontargeting control RNAi construct or the MEKK4 RNAi construct. In the presence of nontargeting control RNAi, Gadd45a robustly increased the level of MKK3/6, MKK4, and p38 phosphorylation, as expected (Fig. 4C). However, MEKK4 RNAi almost completely abrogated these effects of Gadd45a, without altering the level of Gadd45a or the total amounts of MKK3, MKK6, MKK4, or p38 protein (Fig. 4C). These data indicated that MEKK4 is required for Gadd45a-mediated activation of MKK3/6, MKK4 and p38 and provided further evidence that Gadd45a directly activates MEKK4 during skeletal muscle atrophy. The finding that Gadd45a directly activates MEKK4 during skeletal muscle atrophy suggested the hypothesis that MEKK4 might be required for Gadd45a-mediated skeletal muscle atrophy. To test this hypothesis, we transfected mouse TA muscle fibers in vivo with plasmids encoding nontargeting control RNAi (one TA) or MEKK4 RNAi (contralateral TA), both in the absence and presence of Gadd45a plasmid. Seven days after transfection, we harvested bilateral TA muscles for analysis of skeletal muscle fiber size. In the absence of Gadd45a, MEKK4 RNAi did not alter muscle fiber size (Fig. 5, A–C), consistent with the notion that it is not possible to reduce MEKK4 activity under basal conditions because it is already inactive, due to the absence of Gadd45a.

The complex design features of these samples improve data collection efficiency, but also require analysts to account for these features when conducting analysis. Unfortunately, many secondary analysts from fields outside of statistics, biostatistics, and survey methodology do not have adequate training in this area, and as a result may apply incorrect statistical methods when analyzing these survey data sets. This in turn could lead to the publication of incorrect inferences based on the survey data that effectively negate the resources dedicated to these surveys. In this article, we build on the results of a preliminary meta-analysis of 100 peer-reviewed journal articles presenting analyses of data from a variety of national health surveys, which suggested that analytic errors may be extremely prevalent in these types of investigations. We first perform a meta-analysis of a stratified random sample of 145 additional research products analyzing survey data from the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), which describes features of the U.S. Science and Engineering workforce, and examine trends in the prevalence of analytic error across the decades used to stratify the sample. We once again find that analytic errors appear to be quite prevalent in these studies. Next, we present several example analyses of real SESTAT data, and demonstrate that a failure to perform these analyses correctly can result in substantially biased estimates with standard errors that do not adequately reflect complex sample design features. Collectively, the results of this investigation suggest that reviewers of this type of research need to pay much closer attention to the analytic methods employed by researchers attempting to publish or present secondary analyses of survey data."
https://openalex.org/W2460988068,"Obesity is a major public health problem. An in-depth knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of orosensory detection of dietary lipids may help fight it. Humans and rodents can detect fatty acids via lipido-receptors, such as CD36 and GPR120. We studied the implication of the MAPK pathways, in particular, ERK1/2, in the gustatory detection of fatty acids. Linoleic acid, a dietary fatty acid, induced via CD36 the phosphorylation of MEK1/2-ERK1/2ETS-like transcription factor-1 cascade, which requires Fyn-Src kinase and lipid rafts in human taste bud cells (TBCs). ERK1/2 cascade was activated by Ca2+ signaling via opening of the calcium-homeostasis modulator-1 (CALHM1) channel. Furthermore, fatty acid–evoked Ca2+ signaling and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were decreased in both human TBCs after small interfering RNA knockdown of CALHM1 channel and in TBCs from Calhm1-/- mice. Targeted knockdown of ERK1/2 by small interfering RNA or PD0325901 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) in the tongue and genetic ablation of Erk1 or Calhm1 genes impaired preference for dietary fat in mice. Lingual inhibition of ERK1/2 in healthy volunteers also decreased orogustatory sensitivity for linoleic acid. Our data demonstrate that ERK1/2-MAPK cascade is regulated by the opening of CALHM1 Ca2+ channel in TBCs to modulate orogustatory detection of dietary lipids in mice and humans.—Subramaniam, S., Ozdener, M.

The intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in differential effects of TGF-β during different stages are largely unknown. Using cell line models, we have shown that TGF-β inhibits proliferation in normal (RWPE-1) and prostate cancer (DU145) cells but does not have any effect on proliferation of prostate cancer (PC3) cells. We have investigated the role of Jun family proteins (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) in TGF-β effects on cell proliferation. Jun family members were expressed at different levels and responded differentially to TGF-β treatment. TGF-β effects on JunD protein levels, but not mRNA levels, correlated with its effects on cell proliferation. TGF-β induced significant reduction in JunD protein in RWPE-1 and DU145 cells but not in PC3 cells. Selective knockdown of JunD expression using siRNA in DU145 and PC3 cells resulted in significant reduction in cell proliferation, and forced overexpression of JunD increased the proliferation rate. On the other hand, knockdown of c-Jun or JunB had little, if any, effect on cell proliferation; overexpression of c-Jun and JunB decreased the proliferation rate in DU145 cells. Further studies showed that down-regulation of JunD in response to TGF-β treatment is mediated via the proteasomal degradation pathway. In conclusion, we show that specific Jun family members exert differential effects on proliferation in prostate cancer cells in response to TGF-β, and inhibition of cell proliferation by TGF-β requires degradation of JunD protein.

In this study, we investigated the contribution of the α-linked mannosylated O-antigen in the LPS activation of myeloid cells. We compared DC response and Dectin-2 binding to the mannosylated LPS (Man-LPS) from H. alvei PCM 1223 and E. coli O9a with the LPS from Salmonella enterica O66 or K. pneumonia O1, which has the galactosylated O-antigen (Gal-LPS) (Fig. 1A). We observed binding between Man-LPS and Dectin-2, which led to augmentation of TLR4 response in mouse DCs and human monocytes. These results demonstrate a novel role of mannosylated O-antigen in activation of TLR4 in myeloid cells. To address the contribution of O-antigen in the LPS activation of innate immune cells, we tested two structurally defined LPS. The Man-LPS from H. alvei PCM 1223 is built of [-Man-α1,3-Man-α1,2-Man-α1,2-Man-α1,2-Man-α1,3-] repeating units (28Katzenellenbogen E. Kocharova N.A. Zatonsky G.V. Kübler-Kiełb J. Gamian A.

TLR4 activation by these two types of LPS was first measured using the TLR4-MD2-expressing HEK293 reporter cells, with Man-LPS being 4-fold more potent as compared with Gal-LPS (Fig. 1B). Based on this result, we standardized TLR4 activation by using a 4-fold higher concentration of Gal-LPS compared with Man-LPS in the rest of the study. Under these conditions, Man-LPS induced 2-fold more TNFα and IL-10 from mouse BM-DCs than Gal-LPS (Fig. 1C). Man and Gal-LPS induced the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 and mouse MHC class II molecule I-Ab to a similar extent (data not shown). Because O-antigen of Man-LPS consists of α-linked mannose, a glycan ligand of Dectin-2, we tested Dectin-2 binding to the purified LPS in a cell-based reporter assay, in which the lectin-glycan interaction is monitored as β-galactosidase expression (41Ito M. Maruyama T. Saito N. Koganei S. Yamamoto K. Matsumoto N. Killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 binds three members of the classical cadherin family to inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The Dectin-2 BWZ cells were cultured in a 96-well plate coated with Man and Gal-LPS. In this assay, Dectin-2 bound to Man-LPS but not to Gal-LPS (Fig. 2A). No binding was observed between mock BWZ cells and LPS, indicating specific binding of Dectin-2 to Man-LPS (Fig. 2A). In addition, plant-derived galactan, β-linked mannan (Fig. 2B), and LPS from K. pneumoniae O1 (Fig. 2C), which has a homopolymeric Gal O-antigen (42Vinogradov E. Frirdich E. MacLean L.L. Perry M.B. Petersen B.O. Duus J.Ø. Whitfield C.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25070-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), failed to bind to Dectin-2, confirming that Dectin-2 binding to Man-LPS is sugar composition- and linkage-specific rather than nonspecific binding to homopolymeric carbohydrate polymer. Furthermore, the lipid A isolated from Man-LPS failed to bind to Dectin-2 (Fig. 2D), and treatment of Man-LPS with α-mannosidase inhibited the binding (Fig. 2E), suggesting that binding was mediated by the mannosylated O-antigen of Man-LPS. To assess whether the binding is through the carbohydrate-recognition domain of Dectin-2, we compared the binding of WT Dectin-2 and the QPD mutant that no longer recognizes mannose (17Yonekawa A. Saijo S. Hoshino Y. Miyake Y. Ishikawa E. Suzukawa M. Inoue H. Tanaka M. Yoneyama M. Oh-Hora M. Akashi K. Yamasaki S.

Engineering galactose-binding activity into a C-type mannose-binding protein.Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2F, the binding was significantly reduced by the mutations. These results demonstrate that Dectin-2 recognizes the α-linked mannosylated O-antigen of H. alvei LPS. Because mannosylated O-antigen is found in other Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli O9a (44Kubler-Kielb J. Whitfield C. Katzenellenbogen E. Vinogradov E. Identification of the methyl phosphate substituent at the non-reducing terminal mannose residue of the O-specific polysaccharides of Klebsiella pneumoniae O3, Hafnia alvei PCM 1223 and Escherichia coli O9/O9a LPS.Carbohydr. Res. 2012; 347: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we tested whether Dectin-2 recognizes mannosylated O-antigen from E. coli O9a. We found that E. coli O9a LPS bound to Dectin-2, whereas the rough mutant LPS, which lacks the O-antigen (45Dodgson C. Amor P. Whitfield C. Distribution of the rol gene encoding the regulator of lipopolysaccharide O-chain length in Escherichia coli and its influence on the expression of group I capsular K antigens.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), failed (Fig. 2G). We also tested the binding of Dectin-2 to H. alvei in the reporter assay. Dectin-2 bound to paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed H. alvei, whereas the QPD mutant did not (Fig. 2H), suggesting the role of Dectin-2 as a recognition receptor for Gram-negative bacteria with α-linked mannosylated O-antigens. To assess the involvement of Dectin-2 in Man-LPS activation of immune cells, we generated BM-DCs from Dectin-2 KO mice (Fig. 3A). In contrast to WT BM-DCs, Dectin-2 KO BM-DCs were unable to enhance TNFα and IL-10 production in response to Man-LPS (Fig. 3B), indicating that Dectin-2 augments TLR4 activation by Man-LPS. This was reproducible when we used another Gal-LPS from K. pneumoniae O1 (data not shown). Of note, in the TLR4 KO BM-DCs, neither Man nor Gal-LPS induced the cytokine production (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the mannosylated O-antigen is not sufficient to activate Dectin-2 in the absence of TLR4. Similarly, Dectin-2-dependent enhancement in TNFα production by BM-DCs was seen in response to the WT E. coli O9a LPS but not to the rough LPS (Fig. 3C). IL-10 response showed a similar tendency, but this was not statistically significant between WT and rough LPS (Fig. 3C). The TLR4 reactivity of WT and rough LPS was indistinguishable (data not shown). We also assessed the contribution of Dectin-2 to the DC response toward H. alvei. IL-10 production in response to H. alvei was Dectin-2-dependent, suggesting a regulatory role of Dectin-2 in the recognition of H. alvei (Fig. 3D). Although TNFα production in response to Man-LPS was enhanced by Dectin-2 (Fig. 3B), the TNFα response to H. alvei was similar between WT and Dectin-2 KO BM-DCs (Fig. 3D), suggesting alternative molecular mechanisms leading to TNFα production, such as TLR2 that recognizes bacterial cell wall components (46Papadopoulos G.

In the present study, increased levels of LMNA and its partner, nesprin-1 (SYNE1), in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells upon COM crystal adhesion were confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. LMNA was then knocked down by small interfering RNA. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the efficiency of small interfering RNA of LMNA (si-LMNA), which also reduced expression of its partner, SYNE1. Scratch assay and total cell count revealed defects in tissue repair and cell proliferation, respectively, whereas cell death quantitation showed no cytotoxicity in si-LMNA–transfected cells. Crystal-binding assay highlighted the role of LMNA in crystal adhesion, whereas protein network analysis revealed interactions between LMNA and potential COM crystal receptors. Their associations were confirmed by reduced levels of these proteins, including vimentin, tubulin, enolase, S100, and annexin A2, in si-LMNA–transfected cells. These data have demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that LMNA in renal tubular cells is important for tissue repair, cell proliferation, and COM crystal adhesion and is associated with potential COM crystal receptors. Therefore, LMNA may serve as a potential target for prevention of kidney stone disease and its recurrence.—Pongsakul, N., Vinaiphat, A., Chanchaem, P., Fong-ngern, K., Thongboonkerd, V.

Interestingly, these peptides did not represent purely linear IgE epitopes but were presented in a conformational manner by forming a spatially clustered surface-exposed epitope conferring optimal IgE-binding capacity to the folded allergen. Site-directed alanine substitution identified four residues of the IgE epitope that were crucial for antibody binding.

A notable exception is the ternary complex formed by proproteinase E, chymotrypsinogen C, and procarboxypeptidase A (proCPA) in cattle and other ruminants. In the human and pig pancreas binary complexes of proCPA with proelastases were found. To characterize complex formation among human pancreatic protease zymogens in a systematic manner, we performed binding experiments using recombinant proelastases CELA2A, CELA3A, and CELA3B; chymotrypsinogens CTRB1, CTRB2, CTRC, and CTRL1; and procarboxypeptidases CPA1, CPA2, and CPB1. We found that proCELA3B bound not only to proCPA1 (KD 43 nm) but even more tightly to proCPA2 (KD 18 nm), whereas proCELA2A bound weakly to proCPA1 only (KD 152 nm). Surprisingly, proCELA3A, which shares 92% identity with proCELA3B, did not form stable complexes due to the evolutionary replacement of Ala241 with Gly. The polymorphic nature of position 241 in both CELA3A (∼4% Ala241 alleles) and CELA3B (∼2% Gly241 alleles) points to individual variations in complex formation. The functional effect of complex formation was delayed procarboxypeptidase activation due to increased affinity of the inhibitory activation peptide, whereas proelastase activation was unchanged.

In addition to the ternary complex, the bovine pancreas also contains lower levels of binary complexes of proCPA with chymotrypsinogen C (29Brown J.R. Yamasaki M. Neurath H. A new form of bovine pancreatic procarboxypeptidase A.Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or proproteinase E (30Kobayashi Y. Kobayashi R. Hirs C.H.

Further studies on the human pancreatic binary complexes involving procarboxypeptidase A.FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a relatively poorly characterized complex between proCPA2 and chymotrypsinogen B (CTRB) was also described in the rat pancreas (37Oppezzo O. Ventura S. Bergman T. Vendrell J.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, proCPA of the sei whale was found in complex with an unidentified protein, possibly chymotrypsinogen C (38Yoneda T. Amino acid composition and the protein form of procarboxypeptidase A purified from the pancreas of the sei whale Balaenoptera bolealis.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Part B: Comp. Biochem. 1980; 67: 81-86Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The bovine ternary complex has been crystallized and its structure has been solved (39Gomis-Rüth F.X. Gómez M. Bode W. Huber R. Avilés F.X. The three-dimensional structure of the native ternary complex of bovine pancreatic procarboxypeptidase A with proproteinase E and chymotrypsinogen C.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 40Gomis-Rüth F.X.

Crystal structure of an oligomer of proteolytic zymogens: detailed conformational analysis of the bovine ternary complex and implications for their activation.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 861-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this complex chymotrypsinogen C and proproteinase E are bound to different surfaces of the centrally located proCPA. The activation peptide of proCPA participates in most of the binding interactions, suggesting that the rate of proCPA activation might be affected by complex formation and that the complex should dissociate upon proCPA activation (41Michon T. Granon S. Sauve P. Chapus C. The activation peptide of pancreatic procarboxypeptidase A is the keystone of the bovine procarboxypeptidase A-S6 ternary complex.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation peptides of chymotrypsinogen C and proproteinase E are not involved in binding contacts; therefore, activation of these zymogens should not be affected in the complex. Earlier functional studies using the chemically dissociated pig binary complex demonstrated small differences in the rate of trypsin-mediated proCPA activation, which was inconsistent with experimental observations using components of the bovine ternary complex (23Puigserver A. Desnuelle P. Reconstitution of bovine procarboxypeptidase A-S6 from the free subunits.Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Martínez M.C. Avilés F.X.

J. 1982; 205: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This discrepancy has not been resolved and the exact effect of complex formation on proCPA activation has remained uncertain. Even though the physiological role of ternary and binary complexes formed by pancreatic protease zymogens has remained perplexing, investigations into this problem dwindled before the advent of the genomic era. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to perform a comprehensive analysis of complex formation among human pancreatic protease zymogens using recombinant proenzymes and to characterize the binding affinities and the functional significance of the complexes. There are three human pancreatic procarboxypeptidases encoded by the CPA1, CPA2, and CPB1 genes. Four genes code for chymotrypsinogens (CTRB1, CTRB2, CTRC, and CTRL1) and five genes for chymotrypsin-like proelastases (CELA1, CELA2A, CELA2B, CELA3A, and CELA3B). The CELA1 gene, which is the ortholog of the classic pig elastase, is not expressed in the human pancreas due to evolutionary mutations in its promoter region (42Tani T. Kawashima I. Furukawa H. Ohmine T. Takiguchi Y. Characterization of a silent gene for human pancreatic elastase I: structure of the 5′-flanking region.J.

Genet. 1997; 6: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); therefore, this isoform was not studied here. As their gene symbols suggest, both CELA2A-CELA2B and CELA3A-CELA3B gene pairs represent gene duplications in humans. CELA2B was also excluded from the present study as this protein has never been demonstrated in pancreatic secretions and the recombinantly expressed enzyme is inactive due to multiple evolutionary mutations (44Szepessy E. Sahin-Tóth M. Inactivity of recombinant ELA2B provides a new example of evolutionary elastase silencing in humans.Pancreatology. 2006; 6: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, both CELA3A and CELA3B are expressed in the human pancreas and their concentrations appear comparable at the mRNA and protein levels (45Tani T. Ohsumi J. Mita K. Takiguchi Y.

Molecular cloning of complementary DNA encoding one of the human pancreatic protease E isozymes.J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Finally, the three human trypsinogens encoded by the PRSS1, PRSS2, and PRSS3 genes were not included as trypsinogens studied so far have been always found monomeric (1Rinderknecht H. Activation of pancreatic zymogens. Normal activation, premature intrapancreatic activation, protective mechanisms against inappropriate activation.Dig. Dis. Sci. 1986; 31: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Subunit III of the bovine ternary complex was originally identified as an inactive elastase cleaved at the Val30-Asn31 peptide bond (Ref. 25Pignol D. Gaboriaud C. Michon T. Kerfelec B. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Crystal structure of bovine procarboxypeptidase A-S6 subunit III, a highly structured truncated zymogen E.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1763-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and references therein). A similar defective elastase was detected in binary complexes with proCPA1 from human pancreas (34Moulard M. Kerfelec B. Mallet B. Chapus C. Identification of a procarboxypeptidase A-truncated protease E binary complex in human pancreatic juice.FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that subunit III was a purification artifact resulting from the autolytic cleavage of proproteinase E by small amounts of active proteinase E (26Avilés F.X. Pascual R. Salva M. Bonicel J. Puigserver A. Generation of a subunit III-like protein by autolysis of human and porcine proproteinase E in a binary complex with procarboxypeptidase A.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 1998; 251: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We found that despite every precaution to prevent trypsin contamination, our freshly made proCELA3B preparations were already partially autolyzed. As judged by N-terminal Edman degradation, typically about 60% of the fresh proCELA3B preparations were intact, and the rest showed cleavages at the Ser26-Ser27 (20%) and Val30-Asn31 (20%) peptide bonds (Fig. 1). In contrast, fresh proCELA3A preparations were uncleaved. Autolysis occurred during the purification procedure as proCELA3B in the conditioned medium of transfected cells was found intact. During storage at 4 °C, autolysis proceeded slowly with about 80% of proCELA3B cleaved in 6 weeks, with the predominant cleavage (55–60%) observed at the Val30-Asn31 peptide bond. In the same time period, preparations of proCELA3A also became partially cleaved at the Ser25-Ser26 (10%), Ser27-Arg28 (10%), and Val30-His31 (3%) peptide bonds. Surprisingly, when the tryptic activation site Arg28 was mutated in proCELA3B to His (R28H mutant), the fresh zymogen preparations were even more autolyzed (55% cleaved) with enhanced cleavage observed at the Ser26-Ser27 peptide bond (40%). The behavior of the R28H mutant indicated that autolytic cleavage was more likely to occur as a result of the intrinsic zymogen activity of proCELA3B rather than through inadvertent proelastase activation by trypsin contamination. As expected, mutation of the catalytic Ser in proCELA3B (S217A mutant) yielded zymogen preparations with intact N termini. Therefore, for the quantitative binding experiments discussed below we used the S217A mutant versions of proCELA3A and proCELA3B constructs. To develop a simple screening assay for binding among various pancreatic protease zymogens, we took advantage of the availability of His-tagged and non-tagged expression constructs in our laboratory. We expressed all proenzymes in HEK 293T cells via transient transfection and mixed the conditioned media in different combinations of His-tagged and non-tagged zymogens. After a brief incubation to allow for binding, the mixture was passed through a nickel column; the column was washed with 20 mm imidazole and bound proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole. Four 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2). In the absence of binding, only the His-tagged zymogen was eluted, whereas complex formation resulted in co-elution of the non-tagged binding partner as well. We tested for potential binary complexes between non-tagged procarboxypeptidases (proCPA1, proCPA2, and proCPB1) and His-tagged proelastases (proCELA2A, proCELA3A, and proCELA3B) and chymotrypsinogens (CTRB1, CTRB2, CTRC, and CTRL1). As shown in Fig. 2, binding was detected between proCELA2A and proCPA1, proCELA3B and proCPA1, and proCELA3B and proCPA2, whereas other zymogen combinations did not result in measurable complex formation (data not shown for CTRB1, CTRB2, and CTRL1). The observation that proCPA2 formed a complex with human proCELA3B was novel, whereas complexes of proCELA3B and proCELA2A with proCPA1 were previously reported (34Moulard M. Kerfelec B. Mallet B. Chapus C. Identification of a procarboxypeptidase A-truncated protease E binary complex in human pancreatic juice.FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 35Pascual R.

Further studies on the human pancreatic binary complexes involving procarboxypeptidase A.FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The inability of proCELA3A to bind to procarboxypeptidases was surprising as this isoform is 92% identical to proCELA3B at the amino acid level. We also explored whether the CTRC zymogen might participate in ternary complexes with proCELA3B and proCPA1 or proCPA2. Non-tagged CTRC proenzyme was mixed with His-tagged proCELA3B and non-tagged proCPA1 or proCPA2. Because CTRC and proCELA3B migrate similarly on SDS-PAGE, the nickel column eluate was analyzed for the presence of CTRC by Western blots. No detectable CTRC zymogen was co-eluted with the proCELA3B-proCPA1 or proCELA3B-proCPA2 complexes (not shown). To characterize binding affinity between various human procarboxypeptidases and proelastases, we developed an equilibrium binding assay in which a fixed concentration of non-tagged proCPA1 (250 nm) and proCPA2 (100 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of His-tagged proelastases (0–1500 nm) in the presence of nickel resin. After 15 min incubation, His-tagged proelastases together with bound procarboxypeptidases were removed by centrifugation. The amount of the free (unbound) proCPA1 and proCPA2 remaining in the supernatant was determined by enzyme activity measurements and free proCPA1 and proCPA2 concentrations were plotted as a function of total proelastase concentrations. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were determined by fitting the data points to the simple reversible binding equation, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3, proCELA3B bound to both proCPA1 and proCPA2 with relatively high affinity, as judged by the KD values of 43 ± 2 and 18 ± 1 nm, respectively. The slightly stronger binding observed with proCPA2 was surprising as a proCELA3B-proCPA2 complex has not been identified before in human pancreatic secretions. In contrast, only minimal binding of proCELA3A to proCPA1 and proCPA2 was detected with KD values estimated at 10.9 ± 1 and 7.1 ± 0.2 μm, respectively (Fig. 4). Thus, proCELA3A and proCELA3B exhibit at least 250- and 400-fold differences in binding affinity to proCPA1 and proCPA2, respectively. In agreement with a report of a proCELA2A-proCPA1 complex found in human pancreatic juice, we measured binding of proCELA2A to proCPA1 with a KD value of 152 ± 22 nm; which was about 4-fold w"

As such, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying Group I mGluR signaling is important for understanding physiological responses initiated by the activation of these receptors. In the current study, we identify the multifunctional scaffolding protein spinophilin as a novel Group I mGluR-interacting protein. We demonstrate that spinophilin interacts with the C-terminal tail and second intracellular loop of Group I mGluRs. Furthermore, we show that interaction of spinophilin with Group I mGluRs attenuates receptor endocytosis and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, an effect that is dependent upon the interaction of spinophilin with the C-terminal PDZ binding motif encoded by Group I mGluRs. Spinophilin knock-out results in enhanced mGluR5 endocytosis as well as increased ERK1/2, AKT, and Ca2+ signaling in primary cortical neurons. In addition, the loss of spinophilin expression results in impaired mGluR5-stimulated LTD.

Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.

In the present study, we have identified spinophilin as a protein that interacts with the C-terminal PDZ binding motifs of Group I mGluRs and functions to regulate their endocytosis and signaling and the expression of mGluR5-dependent activity. To identify novel Group I mGluR-interacting proteins, we performed a proteomic screen in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transfected with a FLAG-tagged plasmid construct encoding the mGluR1a C-terminal tail (amino acids 841–1199), which encodes both a PDZ binding motif and a PP1γ binding site. We found that a number of novel and known Group I mGluR-interacting proteins were identified (Table 1).

We found that spinophilin was co-immunoprecipitated with both FLAG-mGluR1a and FLAG-mGluR5a (Fig. 1, A and B), confirming that spinophilin was able to interact with both full-length Group I mGluRs. mGluR1a and mGluR5a both encode a functional PDZ binding motif (STL) and PP1γ binding domain (KSCSW) that could mediate either direct or indirect interactions of spinophilin with the receptors (26Mao L.

Therefore, we either deleted the mGluR1a PDZ binding motif or mutated the mGluR1a PP1γ binding motif (KSVTW) to alanine residues to assess whether this prevented spinophilin interactions with the resulting receptor mutants. When tested, we found that spinophilin could still be co-immunoprecipitated with either mutant construct (Fig. 1C). To further evaluate spinophilin interactions with Group I mGluRs, we tested whether spinophilin could be co-immunoprecipitated with mGluR1b, an alternatively spliced variant in which the extended C-terminal tail is replaced by a 20-amino acid segment (29Dhami G.K.

However, spinophilin was found to co-immunoprecipitate with FLAG-mGluR1b, indicating that spinophilin must interact with Group I mGluRs via an additional binding site that was not encoded by the C-terminal tail (Fig. 1D).

We found that co-incubation of GFP-spinophilin-expressing HEK 293 cell lysates with GST-IL2 resulted in the co-precipitation of GFP-spinophilin (Fig. 1E). To further delineate Group I mGluR motifs and residues required for spinophilin interactions, we assessed whether spinophilin could be co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-mGluR1b-K691A, FLAG-mGluR1b-K692b, or a FLAG-tagged mGluR1a construct lacking both the PDZ and PP1γ binding site (FLAG-mGluR1a-PP1-ΔPDZ). We found that GFP-spinophilin could be co-immunoprecipitated with both FLAG-mGluR1b-K692A and FLAG-mGluR1a-PP1Ala-ΔPDZ, but not FLAG-mGluR1b-K691A, which not only lacks a PDZ binding motif but was previously shown to be defective in GRK2 binding (33Dhami G.K.

Thus, spinophilin interactions with Group I mGluRs appeared to be mediated by multiple domains in a manner similar to what we previously characterized for GRK2. Spinophilin was previously shown to interact with the agonist-activated α2AR-Gβγ complex and was proposed to tether the receptor to the plasma membrane, thereby blocking receptor endocytosis (34Brady A.E. Wang Q. Allen P.B. Rizzo M. Greengard P.

Therefore, we examined whether the overexpression of spinophilin would similarly affect agonist-stimulated endocytosis of both FLAG-mGluR1a and FLAG-mGluR5a. We found that overexpression of GFP-spinophilin significantly reduced FLAG-mGluR1a internalization in response to stimulation with 30 μm quisqualate at 5 min and showed a trend to antagonize FLAG-mGluR1a endocytosis following 15 min of agonist activation (Fig. 2A). In contrast, FLAG-mGluR5a internalization was not significantly reduced following 5 min of agonist stimulation following GFP-spinophilin overexpression but was significantly attenuated following 15 min of agonist treatment (Fig. 2B). Because the overexpression of spinophilin in HEK 293 cells attenuated endocytosis of both mGluR1a and mGluR5a, we examined whether the internalization of endogenous mGluR5a was modulated by endogenous spinophilin in cortical neurons. To test this, cortical neurons derived from E18 spinophilin knock-out mice and littermate controls were cultured until 12–14 days in vitro (DIV) and assessed the intracellular redistribution of cell surface biotinylated mGluR5a in response to agonist stimulation (10 μm dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG)) for 5 and 10 min. To further assess domains that may be required for spinophilin-mediated attenuation of Group I mGluR endocytosis, we assessed the ability of spinophilin to prevent the internalization of FLAG-mGluR1b, which lacks an extended C-tail, and FLAG-mGluR1a mutants lacking either the PP1γ domain (FLAG-mGluR1a-PP1Ala) or the PDZ binding motif (FLAG-mGluR1a-ΔPDZ). When tested, spinophilin overexpression did not alter the extent of FLAG-mGluR1b internalization (Fig. 2C). In addition, the loss of the FLAG-mGluR1a PP1γ binding site did not alter the capacity of GFP-spinophilin to antagonize FLAG-mGluR1a endocytosis (Fig. 2D), but deletion of the PDZ binding motif completely abrogated the ability of GFP-spinophilin to attenuate FLAG-mGluR1a endocytosis (Fig. 2E). Thus, these data indicate that a functional association of spinophilin with the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of Group I mGluRs was essential for the regulation of their endocytosis. We found that genetic deletion of endogenous spinophilin resulted in a significantly large increase in mGluR5a internalization at both 5 and 10 min in response to DHPG treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, spinophilin expression plays a significant role in the regulation of endogenous mGluR5a. Because spinophilin interacts with and modulates internalization of Group I mGluRs, we examined whether overexpression of spinophilin would alter the extent of Group I mGluR-stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) formation. We assessed IP formation using wild-type FLAG-mGluR1a and FLAG-mGluR1b constructs as well as a mutant FLAG-mGluR5a cDNA construct that has a single amino acid mutation (A154V) in the glutamate binding region. This residue was analogous to Ala-168 in mGluR1a, which when mutated to valine causes low basal IP formation so that agonist-stimulated responses could be measured (36Esseltine J.L. Willard M.D. Wulur I.H. Lajiness M.E. Barber T.D. Ferguson S.S. Somatic mutations in GRM1 in cancer alter metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 intracellular localization and signaling.Mol. Pharmacol. 2013; 83: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation of either FLAG-mGluR1a, FLAG-mGluR1b, or FLAG-mGluR5a-A154V resulted in a dose-dependent increase in IP formation over 30 min that was not altered by the expression of GFP-spinophilin (Fig. 4, A–C). We also found that FLAG-mGluR1a-PP1Ala- and FLAG-mGluR1a-ΔPDZ-stimulated IP formation was not significantly different (123 ± 27 and 88% ± 16%, respectively) from FLAG-mGluR1-mediated IP formation. In addition, we tested whether overexpression of GFP-spinophilin affected either FLAG-mGluR1a-, FLAG-mGluR1b-, or FLAG-mGluR5a-mediated Ca2+ release. Treatment of HEK 293 cells with 30 μm quisqualate significantly increased Fura-2/AM fluorescence, but the overexpression of GFP-spinophilin did not alter either FLAG-mGluR1a-, FLAG-mGluR1b-, or FLAG-mGluR5a-mediated Ca2+ release, quantified by area under the curve (Fig. 5, A–C). However, when we measured Ca2+ release from primary cortical neurons, we found that 10 μm DHPG treatment resulted in significantly increased Ca2+ release from neurons derived from E18 spinophilin knock-out mice as compared with wild-type cortical neurons (Fig. 5D). Thus, although spinophilin overexpression in HEK 293 cells does not influence Group I mGluR-dependent Ca2+ signaling, endogenous spinophilin contributes to the regulation of Group I mGluR signaling in neurons.FIGURE 5.Effect of spinophilin on Group I mGluR-mediated Ca2+ release.

Dentin fluid flow was measured before and after treatment of dentin with patent dentinal tubules using 1 or 3 applications of the dicalcium and tetracalcium phosphate containing agent TeethmateTM (TM) and comparing the results with two sodium fluoride varnishes VellaTM (VLA) and VanishTM (VAN), after storage in artificial saliva for 24 h, 48 h and 7 days. Significant differences were observed among the 4 methods employed for reducing dentin permeability (p < 0.001) and the 3 post-treatment times (p < 0.001). VLA and VAN never achieved 50% permeability reductions consistently in any of the 3 time periods. Only the calcium phosphate-based desensitizer applied for 3 times consistently reduced dentin permeability by 50% after 24 h. When applied once, the permeability reduction of TM increased progressively over the 3 time periods. After 7 days, only one and three applications of the calcium phosphate-based desensitizer consistently reduced dentin permeability by more than 50%. Permeability reductions corresponded well with scanning electron microscopy examination of dentinal tubule orifice occlusion in dentin specimens treated with the agents. Overall, the dicalcium and tetracalcium phosphate-based desensitizer is effective in reducing dentin permeability via a tubule occlusion mechanism. The ability of the agent to reduce dentin permeability renders it to be potentially useful as a clinical dentin desensitizing agent, which has to be confirmed in future clinical studies. By contrast, the two sodium fluoride varnishes are not effective in dentin permeability reduction and should be considered as topical fluoride delivering agents rather than tubular orifice-blocking agents."
https://openalex.org/W2462070684,"The molecular mechanisms controlling the differentiation of bone marrow stromal stem cells into osteoblasts remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) influences differentiation toward the osteoblasts lineage. BST2 mRNA expression in human alveolar-derived bone marrow stromal cells (hAD-BMSCs) increased during differentiation into osteoblasts. hAD-BMSCs differentiation into osteoblasts and the mRNA expression of the bone-specific markers alkaline phosphatase, collagen type α 1, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, and osterix were reduced by BST2 knockdown using siRNA. Furthermore, BST2 knockdown in hAD-BMSCs resulted in decreased RUNX2 mRNA and protein expression. We hypothesized that BST2 is involved in differentiation of into osteoblasts via the BMP2 signaling pathway. Accordingly, we evaluated the mRNA expression levels of BMP2, BMP receptors (BMPR1 and 2), and the downstream signaling molecules SMAD1, SMAD4, and p-SMAD1/5/8 in BST2 knockdown cells. BMP2 expression following the induction of differentiation was significantly lower in BST2 knockdown cells than in cells treated with a non-targeting control siRNA. Similar results were found for the knockdown of the BMP2 receptor- BMPR1A. We also identified significantly lower expression of SMAD1, SMAD4, and p-SMAD1/5/8 in the BST2 knockdown cells than control cells. Our data provide the first evidence that BST2 is involved in the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells via the regulation of the BMP2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2470069181,"Separation of germ cells from somatic cells is a widespread feature of animal sexual reproduction, with a core set of germ cell factors conserved among diverse animals. It is not known what controls their conserved gonad-specific expression. Core components of epigenetic machinery are ancient, but its role in conserved tissue expression regulation remains unexplored. We found that promoters of the reproductive genes BOULE and DAZL exhibit differential DNA methylation, consistent with their gonad-specific expression in humans and mice. Low or little promoter methylation from the testicular tissue is attributed to spermatogenic cells of various stages in the testis. Such differential DNA methylation is present in the orthologous promoters not only of other mammalian species, but also of chickens and fish, supporting a highly conserved epigenetic mechanism. Furthermore, hypermethylation of DAZL and BOULE promoters in human sperm is associated with human infertility. Our data strongly suggest that epigenetic regulation may underlie conserved germ-cell–specific expression, and such a mechanism may play an important role in human fertility.—Zhang, C., Xue, P., Gao, L., Chen, X., Lin, K., Yang, X., Dai, Y., Xu, E.

However, despite research relating motor sequence learning to spinal cord activity and clinical observations of impeded skill-learning after SCI, implicit procedural learning following spinal cord damage has not been examined.To test the hypothesis that spinal cord injury (SCI) in the absence of concomitant brain injury is associated with a specific implicit motor sequence learning deficit that cannot be explained by depression or impairments in other cognitive measures.Ten participants with SCI in T1-T11, unharmed upper limb motor and sensory functioning, and no concomitant brain injury were compared to ten matched control participants on measures derived from the serial reaction time (SRT) task, which was used to assess implicit motor sequence learning. Explicit generation of the SRT sequence, depression, and additional measures of learning, memory, and intelligence were included to explore the source and specificity of potential learning deficits.There was no between-group difference in baseline reaction time, indicating that potential differences between the learning curves of the two groups could not be attributed to an overall reduction in response speed in the SCI group. Unlike controls, the SCI group showed no decline in reaction time over the first six blocks of the SRT task and no advantage for the initially presented sequence over the novel interference sequence. Meanwhile, no group differences were found in explicit learning, depression, or any additional cognitive measures.The dissociation between impaired implicit learning and intact declarative memory represents novel empirical evidence of a specific implicit procedural learning deficit following SCI, with broad implications for rehabilitation and adjustment."

In addition, sensory functions and sensory integration that are crucial for postural control are also compromised. This study intended to examine how patients with schizophrenia coordinate multiple sensory systems to maintain postural stability in dynamic sensory conditions. Twenty-nine patients with schizophrenia and 32 control subjects were recruited. Postural stability of the participants was examined in six sensory conditions of different level of congruency of multiple sensory information, which was based on combinations of correct, removed, or conflicting sensory inputs from visual, somatosensory, and vestibular systems. The excursion of the center of pressure was measured by posturography. Equilibrium scores were derived to indicate the range of anterior-posterior (AP) postural sway, and sensory ratios were calculated to explore ability to use sensory information to maintain balance. The overall AP postural sway was significantly larger for patients with schizophrenia compared to the controls [patients (69.62±8.99); controls (76.53±7.47); t1,59 = -3.28, p<0.001]. The results of mixed-model ANOVAs showed a significant interaction between the group and sensory conditions [F5,295 = 5.55, p<0.001]. Further analysis indicated that AP postural sway was significantly larger for patients compared to the controls in conditions containing unreliable somatosensory information either with visual deprivation or with conflicting visual information. Sensory ratios were not significantly different between groups, although small and non-significant difference in inefficiency to utilize vestibular information was also noted. No significant correlations were found between postural stability and clinical characteristics. To sum up, patients with schizophrenia showed increased postural sway and a higher rate of falls during challenging sensory conditions, which was independent of clinical characteristics. Patients further demonstrated similar pattern and level of utilizing sensory information to maintain balance compared to the controls."
https://openalex.org/W2471847463,"Heme nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX)-binding proteins act as nitric oxide (NO) sensors among various bacterial species. In several cases, they act to mediate communal behavior such as biofilm formation, quorum sensing, and motility by influencing the activity of downstream signaling proteins such as histidine kinases (HisKa) in a NO-dependent manner. An H-NOX/HisKa regulatory circuit was recently identified in Vibrio cholerae, and the H-NOX protein has been spectroscopically characterized. However, the influence of the H-NOX protein on HisKa autophosphorylation has not been evaluated. This process may be important for persistence and pathogenicity in this organism. Here, we have expressed and purified the V. cholerae HisKa (HnoK) and H-NOX in its heme-bound (holo) and heme-free (apo) forms. Autophosphorylation assays of HnoK in the presence of H-NOX show that the holoprotein in the Fe(II)-NO and Fe(III) forms is a potent inhibitor of HnoK. Activity of the Fe(III) form and aerobic instability of the Fe(II) form suggested that Vibrio cholerae H-NOX may act as a sensor of the redox state as well as NO. Remarkably, the apoprotein also showed robust HnoK inhibition that was dependent on the oxidation of cysteine residues to form disulfide bonds at a highly conserved zinc site. The importance of cysteine in this process was confirmed by mutagenesis, which also showed that holo Fe(III), but not Fe(II)-NO, H-NOX relied heavily upon cysteine for activation. These results highlight a heme-independent mechanism for activation of V. cholerae H-NOX that implicates this protein as a dual redox/NO sensor."

However, the PREX1 domains that facilitate its oncogenic activity and downstream signaling are not completely understood. We identify that ERK1/2 MAPK acts downstream of PREX1 and contributes to PREX1-mediated anchorage-independent cell growth. PREX1 overexpression increased but its shRNA knockdown decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to EGF/IGF-1 stimulation, resulting in induction of the cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and p21WAF1/CIP1. PREX1-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, anchorage-independent cell growth, and cell migration were suppressed by inhibition of MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling. PREX1 overexpression reduced staurosporine-induced apoptosis whereas its shRNA knockdown promoted apoptosis in response to staurosporine or the anti-estrogen drug tamoxifen. Expression of wild-type but not GEF-inactive PREX1 increased anchorage-independent cell growth. In addition, mouse xenograft studies revealed that expression of wild-type but not GEF-dead PREX1 resulted in the formation of larger tumors that displayed increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but not AKT. The impaired anchorage-independent cell growth, apoptosis, and ERK1/2 signaling observed in stable PREX1 knockdown cells was restored by expression of wild-type but not GEF-dead-PREX1. Therefore, PREX1-Rac-GEF activity is critical for PREX1-dependent anchorage-independent cell growth and xenograft tumor growth and may represent a possible therapeutic target for breast cancers that exhibit PREX1 overexpression.

https://openalex.org/W2468315746,"Patients with Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) can present with rapid tooth loss or fractures of enamel as well as alterations in enamel thickness, color, and shape; factors that may compromise aesthetic appearance and masticatory function. The aim was to explore the experiences and perceptions of adolescents and young adults living with AI and receiving early prosthetic therapy. Seven patients with severe AI aged 16 to 23 years who underwent porcelain crown therapy participated in one-to-one individual interviews. The interviews followed a topic guide consisting of open-ended questions related to experiences of having AI. Transcripts from the interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The analysis process identified three main themes: Disturbances in daily life, Managing disturbances, and Normalization of daily life. These themes explain the experiences of patients living with enamel disturbances caused by AI and receiving early crown therapy. Experiences include severe pain and sensitivity problems, feelings of embarrassment, and dealing with dental staff that lack knowledge and understanding of their condition. The patients described ways to manage their disturbances and to reduce pain when eating or drinking, and strategies for meeting other people. After definitive treatment with porcelain crown therapy, they described feeling like a normal patient. In conclusion the results showed that adolescents and young adults describe a profound effect of AI on several aspects of their daily life."
https://openalex.org/W2465376387,"We examined the development of racial categorizations of faces spanning the European-East Asian (""White-Asian"") categorical continuum in children between the ages of four and nine as well as adults. We employed a stimulus set that independently varied skin color and other aspects of facial physiognomy, allowing the contribution of each to be assessed independently and in interaction with each other. Results demonstrated substantial development across this age range in children's ability to draw on both sorts of cue, with over twice as much variance explained by stimulus variation in adults than children. Nonetheless, children were clearly sensitive to both skin color and other aspects of facial physiognomy, suggesting that understanding of the White-Asian category boundary develops in a somewhat different way than understanding of the White-Black category boundary, in which attention to features other than skin color appear only somewhat later. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for theories of social categorization."
https://openalex.org/W2468535796,"The vast majority of braconid wasps are parasitoids of other insects. Although a few cases of pure phytophagy (primary gall production and seed predation) are known, no previous entomophytophagous species (i.e. ones that display entomophagy and phytophagy sequentially), has been discovered among braconids. We describe the detailed biology and specialized larval morphology for the first confirmed entomophytophagous braconid species. Leaf galls on Garuga pinnata Roxb. (Burseraceae) in India, induced by the psyllid, Phacopteron lentiginosum Buckton (Hemiptera: Psylloidea, Phacopteronidae) were sampled throughout a period of several months and found to suffer a high level of attack by a new species Bracon garugaphagae Ranjith & Quicke which is here described and illustrated. The wasps oviposit singly into the galls without paralysing the psyllids. The larvae first attack psyllid nymphs which they seek out within the gall, kill them with a single bite and consume them. Unique dorsal abdominal tubercles, with eversible tips present on the abdominal segments of the larvae that are used to help maintain larval position while feeding, are illustrated. After consuming all available prey, the larvae continue feeding on gall tissue until mature enough to spin cocoons and pupate. The new species illustrates, for the first time, a possible intermediate stage in the evolution of pure phytophagy within the Braconidae. Interestingly, the two unrelated seed predator Bracon species are also associated with Burseraceae, perhaps indicating that this plant family is particularly suited as a food for braconine wasps."
https://openalex.org/W2472393405,"The cytoplasm of the eukaryotic cell is a highly compartmentalized space that contains a variety of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules in addition to its complement of membrane-bound organelles. These RNP granules contain specific sets of proteins and mRNAs and form in response to particular environmental and developmental stimuli. Two of the better-characterized of these RNP structures are the stress granule and Processing-body (P-body) that have been conserved from yeast to humans. In this report, we examined the cues regulating stress granule assembly and the relationship between stress granule and P-body foci. These two RNP structures are generally thought to be independent entities in eukaryotic cells. However, we found here that stress granule and P-body proteins were localized to a common or merged granule specifically in response to a hypoosmotic stress. Interestingly, these hybrid-bodies were found to be transient structures that were resolved with time into separate P-body and stress granule foci. In all, these data suggest that the identity of an RNP granule is not absolute and that it can vary depending upon the nature of the induction conditions. Since the activities of a granule are likely influenced by its protein constituency, these observations are consistent with the possibility of RNP granules having distinct functions in different cellular contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2464726459,"Objective Metabolic dysfunctions, such as fatty liver, obesity and insulin resistance, are among the most common contemporary diseases worldwide, and their prevalence is continuously rising. Mimp/Mtch2 is a mitochondrial carrier protein homologue, which localizes to the mitochondria and induces mitochondrial depolarization. Mimp/Mtch2 single-nucleotide polymorphism is associated with obesity in humans and its loss in mice muscle protects from obesity. Our aim was to study the effects of Mimp/Mtch2 overexpression in vivo. Methods Transgenic mice overexpressing Mimp/Mtch2-GFP were characterized and monitored for lipid accumulation, weight and blood glucose levels. Transgenic mice liver and kidneys were used for gene expression analysis. Results Mimp/Mtch2-GFP transgenic mice express high levels of fatty acid synthase and of β-oxidation genes and develop fatty livers and kidneys. Moreover, high-fat diet–fed Mimp/Mtch2 mice exhibit high blood glucose levels. Our results also show that Mimp/Mtch2 is involved in lipid accumulation and uptake in cells and perhaps in human obesity. Conclusions Mimp/Mtch2 alters lipid metabolism and may play a role in the onset of obesity and development of insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2469192517,"Epidemiological data indicate that type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, risk stratification for HCC has not been fully elucidated in diabetic population. The aim of this study was to identify potential predictors of HCC in diabetic patients without chronic viral hepatitis. A cohort of 3,544 diabetic patients without chronic viral hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis was established and subjects were randomly allocated into a derivation and a validation set. A scoring system was developed by using potential predictors of increased risk of HCC from the Cox proportional hazards model. The performance of the scoring system was tested for validation by using receiver operating characteristics analysis. During median follow-up of 55 months, 36 cases of HCC developed (190 per 100,000 person-years). The 5- and 10-year cumulative incidences of HCC were 1.0%, and 2.2%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age > 65 years, low triglyceride levels and high gamma-glutamyl transferase levels were independently associated with an increased risk of HCC. DM-HCC risk score, a weighted sum of scores from these 3 parameters, predicted 10-year development of HCC with area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.86, and discriminated different risk categories for HCC in the derivation and validation cohort. In conclusion, old age, low triglyceride level and high gamma-glutamyl transferase level may help to identify individuals at high risk of developing HCC in diabetic patients without chronic viral hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W2462669817,"While advances in high-throughput screening have resulted in increased ability to identify synergistic anti-cancer drug combinations, validation of drug synergy in the in vivo setting and prioritization of combinations for clinical development remain low-throughput and resource intensive. Furthermore, there is currently no viable method for prospectively assessing drug synergy directly in human patients in order to potentially tailor therapies. To address these issues we have employed the previously described CIVO platform and developed a quantitative approach for investigating multiple combination hypotheses simultaneously in single living tumors. This platform provides a rapid, quantitative and cost effective approach to compare and prioritize drug combinations based on evidence of synergistic tumor cell killing in the live tumor context. Using a gemcitabine resistant model of pancreatic cancer, we efficiently investigated nine rationally selected Abraxane-based combinations employing only 19 xenografted mice. Among the drugs tested, the BCL2/BCLxL inhibitor ABT-263 was identified as the one agent that synergized with Abraxane® to enhance acute induction of localized apoptosis in this model of human pancreatic cancer. Importantly, results obtained with CIVO accurately predicted the outcome of systemic dosing studies in the same model where superior tumor regression induced by the Abraxane/ABT-263 combination was observed compared to that induced by either single agent. This supports expanded use of CIVO as an in vivo platform for expedited in vivo drug combination validation and sets the stage for performing toxicity-sparing drug combination studies directly in cancer patients with solid malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2463194965,"In endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), proximal type 1A endoleaks can occur as a result of hostile neck anatomy or over- or undersizing of the endograft. As the current standard is based on the diameter or average of the short and long axes in a central lumen reconstruction image, it can falter in irregularly shaped aortic necks. An alternative method is circumference-based, therefore minimizing the measurement error. In this study we aimed to assess the degree of discrepancy between both methods and the association of this discrepancy with the occurrence of endoleak type 1A.All patients with early (<30 days post-operative) endoleak type 1A after elective EVAR at our center between 2004 and 2016 were identified for a retrospective case-control study. Control patients were matched based on hostile neck anatomy, such as calcification, thrombus, reverse taper, and β-angulation. The aortic neck diameter was measured using the traditional, diameter-based method as well as an alternative method, based on the circumference of the aortic neck.In 482 EVAR patients, 18 early endoleak type 1A cases were found (3.9%). After exclusion, 12 cases remained and 48 matching controls were found. No significant differences were found between the two measuring methods at any level below the renal arteries. The inter-observer variability was significant for the D(mean) (0.4 ± 1.69 mm, P = .02) and was larger than the D(circ) method (-0.1 ± 1.03 mm, P = .35). In only four out of 12 cases the endograft size was 10-20% larger than the D(mean) and D(circ) measurements. The differences between the diameter of the D(mean) and D(circ) and the chosen endograft were smaller for the case group (-8 ± 25.6% and -7 ± 24%) than for the control group. (-12.4 ± 12.4% and -11 ± 10.7%).The difference between the D(mean) and D(circ) methods for aortic neck measurement was not large enough to play a significant role in the incidence of endoleak type 1A. Inadequate oversizing and considerable β-angulation of the aortic neck may have been the cause of endoleak type 1A in this population. Robust and well-investigated sizing methods are paramount for accurate endograft sizing and prevention of endoleak type 1A. Therefore the lack of studies in this field and a sizeable inter-observer variability do not justify the widespread reliance on the traditional diameter-based methods for endograft sizing."
https://openalex.org/W2464666258,"Protein O-mannosylation is an essential post-translational modification. It is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by a family of protein O-mannosyltransferases that are conserved from yeast (PMTs) to human (POMTs). The degree of functional conservation between yeast and human protein O-mannosyltransferases is uncharacterized. In bakers' yeast, the main in vivo activities are due to heteromeric Pmt1-Pmt2 and homomeric Pmt4 complexes. Here we describe an enzymatic assay that allowed us to monitor Pmt4 activity in vitro We demonstrate that detergent requirements and acceptor substrates of yeast Pmt4 are different from Pmt1-Pmt2, but resemble that of human POMTs. Furthermore, we mimicked two POMT1 amino acid exchanges (G76R and V428D) that result in severe congenital muscular dystrophies in humans, in yeast Pmt4 (I112R and I435D). In vivo and in vitro analyses showed that general features such as protein stability of the Pmt4 variants were not significantly affected, however, the mutants proved largely enzymatically inactive. Our results demonstrate functional and biochemical similarities between POMT1 and its orthologue from bakers' yeast Pmt4."

https://openalex.org/W2474845096,"Calcium (Ca2+) is a universal second messenger in all higher organisms and centrally involved in the launch of responses to environmental stimuli. Ca2+ signals in the cytosol are initiated by the activation of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane and/or in endomembranes. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) contains a Ca2+-permeable channel of the TRP family, TRPY1, which is localized in the vacuolar membrane and contributes to cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) elevations, for example in response to osmotic upshock. A TRPY1 homologue in the rice blast fungus is known to be important for growth and pathogenicity. To determine the role of the TRP channel family in the maize pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola, proteins homologous to TRPY1 were searched. This identified not one, but four genes in the C. graminicola genome, which had putative orthologs in other fungi, and which we named CgTRPF1 through 4. The topology of the CgTRPF proteins resembled that of TRPY1, albeit with a variable number of transmembrane (TM) domains additional to the six-TM-domain core and a diverse arrangement of putatively Ca2+-binding acidic motifs. All CgTRPF genes were expressed in axenic culture and throughout the infection of maize. Like TRPY1, all TRPF proteins of C. graminicola were localized intracellularly, albeit three of them were found not in large vacuoles, but co-localized in vesicular structures. Deletion strains for the CgTRPF genes were not altered in processes thought to involve Ca2+ release from internal stores, i.e. spore germination, the utilization of complex carbon sources, and the generation of tip-focussed [Ca2+]cyt spikes. Heterologous expression of CgTRPF1 through 4 in a tryp1Δ yeast mutant revealed that none of the channels mediated the release of Ca2+ in response to osmotic upshock. Accordingly, aequorin-based [Ca2+]cyt measurements of C. graminicola showed that in this fungus, osmotic upshock-triggered [Ca2+]cyt elevations were generated entirely by influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space. Cgtrpf mutants did not show pathogenicity defects in leaf infection assays. In summary, our study reveals major differences between different fungi in the contribution of TRP channels to Ca2+-mediated signal transduction."

Deletion of Fstl1 leads to postnatal death in mice due to respiratory failure. To further explore the role of FSTL1 in mouse lung development, we created a transgene SFTPC-Fstl1 allele mouse displaying significant epithelial overexpression of Fstl1 in all stages of lung development. However, epithelial overexpression of Fstl1 did not alter lung morphogenesis, epithelial differentiation and lung function. Moreover, we found that FSTL1 function was blocked by the epithelial polarization, which was reflected by the remarkable apical secretion of FSTL1 and the basolateral BMP signaling. Taken together, this study demonstrates that tightly spatial interaction of FSTL1 and BMP signaling plays an essential role in lung development."
https://openalex.org/W2471625188,"Although numerical magnitude processing has been related to individual differences in arithmetic, its role in children’s multiplication performance remains largely unknown. On the other hand, studies have indicated that phonological awareness is an important correlate of individual differences in children’s multiplication performance, but the involvement of phonological memory, another important phonological processing skill, has not been studied in much detail. Furthermore, knowledge about the relative contribution of above mentioned processes to the specific arithmetic operation of multiplication in children is lacking. The present study therefore investigated for the first time the unique contributions of numerical magnitude comparison and phonological processing in explaining individual differences in 63 fourth graders’ multiplication fact ability (mean age = 9.6 years, SD = .67). The results showed that children’s multiplication fact competency correlated significantly with symbolic and nonsymbolic magnitude comparison as well as with phonological short-term memory. A hierarchical regression analysis revealed that, after controlling for intellectual ability and general reaction time, both symbolic and nonsymbolic magnitude comparison and phonological short-term memory accounted for unique variance in multiplication fact performance. The ability to compare symbolic magnitudes was found to contribute the most, indicating that the access to numerical magnitudes by means of Arabic digits is a key factor in explaining individual differences in children’s multiplication fact ability."
https://openalex.org/W2472307394,"Diseased myocardium from humans and experimental animal models shows heightened expression and activity of a specific subtype of phospholipase C (PLC), the splice variant PLCβ1b. Previous studies from our group showed that increasing PLCβ1b expression in adult mouse hearts by viral transduction was sufficient to cause sustained contractile dysfunction of rapid onset, which was maintained indefinitely in the absence of other pathological changes in the myocardium. We hypothesized that impaired contractility alone would be sufficient to induce a compensatory transcriptional response. Unbiased, comprehensive mRNA-sequencing was performed on 6 biological replicates of rAAV6-treated blank, PLCβ1b and PLCβ1a (closely related but inactive splice variant) hearts 8 weeks after injection, when reduced contractility was manifest in PLCβ1b hearts without evidence of induced hypertrophy. Expression of PLCβ1b resulted in expression changes in only 9 genes at FDR<0.1 when compared with control and these genes appeared unrelated to contractility. Importantly, PLCβ1a caused similar mild expression changes to PLCβ1b, despite a complete lack of effect of this isoform on cardiac contractility. We conclude that contractile depression caused by PLCβ1b activation is largely independent of changes in the transcriptome, and thus that lowered contractility is not sufficient in itself to provoke measurable transcriptomic alterations. In addition, our data stress the importance of a stringent control group to filter out transcriptional changes unrelated to cardiac function."

Skilled language comprehension requires listeners to flexibly shift between different dimensions. We asked whether this shifting would be difficult for 3-year-olds, who have relatively immature executive function skills and struggle to switch between dimensions in card sorting tasks. In the current experiment, children first heard a series of sentences identifying objects using a single dimension (either names or colors). In the second half of the experiment, the labeling dimension was switched. Children were significantly less accurate in fixating the correct object following the dimensional switch. This disruption, however, was temporary; recognition accuracy recovered with increased exposure to the new labeling dimension. These findings provide the first evidence that children’s difficulty in shifting between dimensions impacts their ability to comprehend speech. This limitation may affect children’s ability to form rich, multi-dimensional representations when learning new words."
