Ideally, they could also be processed in a way that is compatible with current microfabrication technologies. Huang et al. deposited a relatively thick layer of TiC on top of an oxide-coated Si film. After chlorination, most, but importantly not all, of the TiC was converted into a porous carbon film that could be turned into an electrochemical capacitor. The carbon films were highly flexible, and the residual TiC acted as a stress buffer with the underlying Si film. The films could be separated from the Si to form free-floating films, with the TiC providing a support layer. Science , this issue p. 691"

However, electrons easily lose this information by scattering into the other valley. Rivera et al. placed single layers of MoSe 2 and WSe 2 on top of each other and shone circularly polarized light on the structure. The light caused excitons—pairs of electrons and holes—to form so that the hole and electron came from the same valley but different layers. The valley-specific character of such excitons persisted far longer than would be possible in a single layer of either material. Science , this issue p. 688"

Over the past decade, the field has undergone a renaissance as compounds that absorb visible light have proven to be versatile catalysts for organic reactions. For the most part, however, these catalysts have contained rare metals such as ruthenium or iridium. Kainz et al. now report a blue light-driven C-N bond-forming reaction catalyzed by Earth-abundant copper (see the Perspective by Greaney). Through coordination to a chiral ligand, the copper center couples alkyl chlorides to indoles and carbazoles with a high degree of enantioselectivity. Science , this issue p. 681 ; see also p. 666"

Evaluating global impact is complicated because deforestation can produce different results in different climate zones, making it hard to determine large-scale trends rather than more local ones. Alkama and Cescatti conducted a global assessment of the biophysical effects of forest cover change. Forest loss amplifies diurnal temperature variations, increases mean and maximum air temperatures, and causes a significant amount of warming when compared to CO 2 emission from land-use change.

HCM can be caused by mutations in components of the sarcomere (the heart's contractile unit), most notably myosin. Hypercontractility is among the earliest heart disturbances seen in mice carrying these myosin mutations, implying that the mutations inflict their damage by increasing myosin's power production. Green et al. identified a small molecule that binds to myosin and inhibits its activity (see the Perspective by Warshaw).

They measured effects of DNA methylation and histone modifications by methylation or deacetylation in single cells using time-lapse microscopy. Silencing was an all-or-none, stochastic event, so graded adjustments to transcription occurred from changes in the proportion of cells that responded. Furthermore, the duration of recruitment of the chromatin regulators determined the fraction of cells that were silenced.

Surprisingly, however, these archaea do not necessarily need their bacterial partners to survive or grow.

Several groups of methane-oxidizing archaea could use a range of soluble electron acceptors instead of coupling to active bacterial sulfate reduction.

Naudts et al. reconstructed the history of forest management in Europe in the context of a land-atmosphere model. The release of carbon otherwise stored in litter, dead wood, and soil carbon pools in managed forests was one key factor contributing to climate warming. Second, the conversion of broadleaved forests to coniferous forests has changed the albedo and evapotranspiration of those forests, also leading to warming. Thus, climate change mitigation policies in Europe and elsewhere may need to consider changes in forest management. Science , this issue p. 597"

The small protein ubiquitin is attached, typically in many copies, to the target protein, which is then recognized and broken down by the proteasome. Shi et al. found a repeat structure in the proteasome for recognizing ubiquitin as well as ubiquitin-like (UBL) proteins. Tandem binding sites allow the proteasome to dock multiple proteins. One of the bound UBL proteins is an enzyme that cleaves ubiquitin-protein conjugates, which antagonizes degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2292849618,"Background Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages I-IIIA. However, more than 20% of these patients develop recurrence and die due to their disease. The release of tumor cells into peripheral blood (CTCs) is one of the main causes of recurrence of cancer. The objectives of this study are to identify the prognostic value of the presence and characterization of CTCs in peripheral blood in patients undergoing radical resection for NSCLC. Patients and Methods 56 patients who underwent radical surgery for previously untreated NSCLC were enrolled in this prospective study. Peripheral blood samples for CTC analysis were obtained before and one month after surgery. In addition CTCs were phenotypically characterized by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. Results 51.8% of the patients evaluated were positive with the presence of CTCs at baseline. A decrease in the detection rate of CTCs was observed in these patients one month after surgery (32.1%) (p = 0.035). The mean number of CTCs was 3.16 per 10 ml (range 0–84) preoperatively and 0.66 (range 0–3) in postoperative determination. EGFR expression was found in 89.7% of the patients at baseline and in 38.9% patients one month after surgery. The presence of CTCs after surgery was significantly associated with early recurrence (p = 0.018) and a shorter disease free survival (DFS) (p = .008). In multivariate analysis CTC presence after surgery (HR = 5.750, 95% CI: 1.50–21.946, p = 0.010) and N status (HR = 0.296, 95% CI: 0.091–0.961, p = 0.043) were independent prognostic factors for DFS. Conclusion CTCs can be detected and characterized in patients undergoing radical resection for non-small cell lung cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2274199511,"Voltage-gated CaV1.2 channels (L-type calcium channel α1C subunits) are critical mediators of transcription-dependent neural plasticity. Whether these channels signal via the influx of calcium ion (Ca(2+)), voltage-dependent conformational change (VΔC), or a combination of the two has thus far been equivocal. We fused CaV1.2 to a ligand-gated Ca(2+)-permeable channel, enabling independent control of localized Ca(2+) and VΔC signals. This revealed an unexpected dual requirement: Ca(2+) must first mobilize actin-bound Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, freeing it for subsequent VΔC-mediated accumulation. Neither signal alone sufficed to activate transcription. Signal order was crucial: Efficiency peaked when Ca(2+) preceded VΔC by 10 to 20 seconds. CaV1.2 VΔC synergistically augmented signaling by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Furthermore, VΔC mistuning correlated with autistic symptoms in Timothy syndrome. Thus, nonionic VΔC signaling is vital to the function of CaV1.2 in synaptic and neuropsychiatric processes."

https://openalex.org/W2285229643,"The readout of histone modifications plays a critical role in chromatin-regulated processes. Dimethylation at Lys-36 on histone H3 (H3K36me2) is associated with actively transcribed genes, and global up-regulation of this modification is associated with several cancers. However, the molecular mechanism by which H3K36me2 is sensed and transduced to downstream biological outcomes remains unclear. Here we identify a PWWP domain within the histone lysine methyltransferase and oncoprotein NSD2 that preferentially binds to nucleosomes containing H3K36me2. In cells, the NSD2 PWWP domain interaction with H3K36me2 plays a role in stabilizing NSD2 at chromatin. Furthermore, NSD2's ability to induce global increases in H3K36me2 via its enzymatic activity, and consequently promote cellular proliferation, is compromised by mutations within the PWWP domain that specifically abrogate H3K36me2-recognition. Together, our results identify a pivotal role for NSD2 binding to its catalytic product in regulating its cellular functions, and suggest a model for how this interaction may facilitate epigenetic spreading and propagation of H3K36me2."

MacGregor et al. conclude that more snow is accumulating and that the ice in the interior is flowing more slowly than it did thousands of years ago (see the Perspective by Hvidberg). During the last glacial period, higher rates of atmospheric dust deposition produced softer ice, which flowed more readily than cleaner ice. During most of the Holocene, though, atmospheric dust concentrations were lower, and the less-dusty ice that formed was stiffer, meaning it did not flow or thin so rapidly. Thus, the thickening seen today in the central regions of Greenland is partly a response to changes in ice rheology that occurred thousands of years ago.

https://openalex.org/W2338299098,"The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is found at the core of two evolutionarily conserved complexes known as TOR complexes 1 and 2 (TORC1 and TORC2). In fission yeast, TORC2 is dispensable for proliferation under optimal growth conditions but is required for starvation and stress responses. We have previously reported that loss of function of TORC2 renders cells highly sensitive to DNA replication stress; however, the mechanism underlying this sensitivity is unknown. TORC2 has one known direct substrate, the kinase Gad8, which is related to AKT in human cells. Here we show that both TORC2 and its substrate Gad8 are found in the nucleus and are bound to the chromatin. We also demonstrate that Gad8 physically interacts with the MluI cell cycle box-binding factor (MBF) transcription complex that regulates the G1/S progression and the response to DNA stress. In mutant cells lacking TORC2 or Gad8, the binding of the MBF complex to its cognate promoters is compromised, and the induction of MBF target genes in response to DNA replication stress is reduced. Consistently, the protein levels of Cdt2 and Cig2, two MBF target genes, are reduced in the absence of TORC2-Gad8 signaling. Taken together, our findings highlight critical functions of TORC2 in the nucleus and suggest a role in surviving DNA replication stress via transcriptional regulation of MBF target genes."

Carotid-Intima Media Thickness (c-IMT) and bone mineral density (BMD) were performed by ultrasound and DEXA, respectively. CD4+/CD8+ T-cell activation, senescence and osteoprotegerin plasma levels were measured by flow-cytometry and ELISA, respectively. Among HIV positive patients, 56.4% had osteopenia/osteoporosis and 45.7% had pathological c-IMT (>0.9 mm). Subjects with pathological c-IMT and BMD exhibited higher CD4+ and CD8+ activated, CD8+ senescent and osteoprotegerin than subjects with normal c-IMT and BMD. HIV positive subjects with osteopenia/osteoporosis had higher c-IMT than subjects with normal BMD, and linear regression analysis showed a negative correlation between BMD and c-IMT. Several factors are implicated in the pathogenesis of non-AIDS comorbidities in HIV positive patients. Osteoprotegerin together with inflammation and immunosenescence in HIV positive patients could affect bone and vascular system and could be considered as a possible common link between these two diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2281474752,"Egg-laying decisions are critical for insects, and particularly those competing for limited resources. Sensory information used by females to mediate egg-laying decisions has been reported to be primarily chemical, but the role of vibration has received little attention. We tested the hypothesis that vibrational cues produced by feeding larvae occupying a seed influences egg-laying decisions amongst female cowpea beetles. This hypothesis is supported by three lines of evidence using two strains of the cowpea beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus), an Indian strain with choosy females and aggressively competing larvae and a Brazilian strain with less choosy females and larvae exhibiting an ""accommodating"" type of competition. First, in free-choice bioassays of seed selection, choosy Indian females selected control seeds (free of eggs, larvae, or egg-laying marker) over seeds with live larvae (free of eggs and egg-laying marker), but did not discriminate between control seeds and those with dead larvae. In contrast, less choosy Brazilian females showed no preference for seeds containing live or dead larvae over controls. Second, laser-doppler vibrometer recordings confirmed that larvae feeding inside seeds generate vibrations that are available to the female during egg-laying decisions. Third, during dichotomous choice experiments where artificial vibrations approximating those produced by feeding larvae were played back during seed selection, Indian females preferred immobile control seeds over vibrating seeds, but Brazilian females showed no preference. These results support the hypothesis that females use larval vibrations in their egg-laying decisions; whether these vibrations are passive cues exploited by the female, or active signals that 'steer' the behaviour of the female is unknown. We propose that vibration cues and signals could be important for host selection in insects, particularly those laying on substrates where visual or chemical cues may be unreliable. This seems to be the case with females of the cowpea beetle since visual cues are not important and chemical egg-marking does not last more than two weeks, allowing vibration cues to improve discrimination of egg-laying substrate particularly by choosy females."
https://openalex.org/W2280492606,"The Rho family small GTPase Cdc42 has been implicated in a wide range of cellular functions including the establishment of cell polarity and the remodeling of the actin cytoskeletal architecture, resulting in the tight regulation of cell growth and survival during developmental processes. The complete knock-out of Cdc42 in the mouse is embryonic-lethal, and its targeted deletion in various tissues has been shown to disrupt tissue homeostasis. Thus far, in most studies, the targeted deletion of Cdc42 occurred during embryogenesis. Here, we have used a conditional gene deletion strategy in mice to probe the specific role of Cdc42 during adult mammary gland function. Cdc42 conditional-knock-out females were unable to adequately nourish their pups, due to a disorganized epithelial compartment within their mammary glands. A closer examination showed that their mammary epithelial cells were not able to maintain functional alveolar lumens, due to an inability to establish normal apical/basal epithelial polarity, as well as proper cell-cell contacts. Loss of these essential epithelial characteristics led to a premature sloughing off of the Cdc42-null epithelial cells. Overall our findings demonstrate that Cdc42 plays essential roles in mammary gland function post pregnancy, where it helps to establish proper epithelial cell polarity and tissue homeostasis during lactation."
https://openalex.org/W2284398211,"AMPA receptors are glutamate-gated cation channels assembled from GluA1–4 subunits and have properties that are strongly dependent on the subunit composition. The subunits have different propensities to form homomeric or various heteromeric receptors expressed on cell surface, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we examined the biochemical basis for the poor ability of GluA3 subunits to form homomeric receptors, linked previously to two amino acid residues, Tyr-454 and Arg-461, in its ligand binding domain (LBD). Surface expression of GluA3 was improved by co-assembly with GluA2 but not with stargazin, a trafficking chaperone and modulator of AMPA receptors. The secretion efficiency of GluA2 and GluA3 LBDs paralleled the transport difference between the respective full-length receptors and was similarly dependent on Tyr-454/Arg-461 but not on LBD stability. In comparison to GluA2, GluA3 homomeric receptors showed a strong and Tyr-454/Arg-461-dependent tendency to aggregate both in the macroscopic scale measured as lower solubility in nonionic detergent and in the microscopic scale evident as the preponderance of hydrodynamically large structures in density gradient centrifugation and native gel electrophoresis. We conclude that the impaired surface expression of homomeric GluA3 receptors is caused by nonproductive assembly and aggregation to which LBD residues Tyr-454 and Arg-461 strongly contribute. This aggregation inhibits the entry of newly synthesized GluA3 receptors to the secretory pathway.

The functional properties of AMPA receptors, including channel kinetics, ion permeability, ligand pharmacology, and regulation, are determined by the subunit composition. AMPA receptors are built from four subunit types (GluA1–4), each expressed as multiple alternatively spliced and/or RNA-edited variants. Studies with native and recombinant receptors indicate that receptor assembly is not random but strongly favors certain subunit combinations (3.Mansour M. Nagarajan N. Nehring R.B. Clements J.D.

Recently, we demonstrated that two LBD residues, Tyr-454 and Arg-461, are responsible for the poor delivery of homomeric GluA3 receptors to cell surface both in the presence and absence of NTD (12.Coleman S.K.

These residues are not directly engaged in glutamate binding nor in subunit interactions, and the reason why they inhibit the formation or transport of homomeric GluA3 to the cell surface is unclear. Here, we performed a comparative biochemical analysis of wild-type and mutated GluA2 and GluA3 receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. We found that GluA3 receptors exhibit aberrant, Tyr-454/Arg-461-dependent tendency to disturbed oligomerization and aggregation. Our findings suggest that subunit-dependent balance between transport-competent oligomers and higher-order abnormal assemblies contributes to the preferences of AMPA receptor subunits for homomeric or heteromeric expression.

For immunoblotting, the following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M1 (1 μg/ml; Sigma F-3040), anti-GAPDH (0.03 μg/ml; Sigma G-8795), anti-GFP (1:1000; Sigma G6539), rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc (0.2 μg/ml; AbCam ab9106), anti-GluA2/3 IgG (1 μg/ml; Millipore #07-598), anti-GluN1 (0.2 μg/ml; Chemicon AB1516), anti-GRP78 (Sigma G-8918; 1:2000), and anti-stargazin serum (1:2000; Ref. 13.Coleman S.K.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (1:3000; NA931V) or anti-rabbit (1:3000; NA934V) IgGs, both from GE Healthcare, were used as secondary antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (2 μg/ml; Sigma F-3165) or anti-Myc (5 μg/ml; 9E10) was used. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin and transfected with appropriate plasmids by using calcium phosphate coprecipitation as previously described (21.Coleman S.K.

For some experiments cells were incubated with tunicamycin (2 μg/ml; Sigma T-7765) for 24 h before harvesting. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings and analysis of glutamate-triggered currents in transfected cells were carried out as previously described (22.Möykkynen T. Coleman S.K. Semenov A. Keinänen K.

In brief, recordings from AMPA receptors expressing HEK293 cells were done at a holding potential of −60 mV. l-Glutamate was diluted in external recording solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4; 320 mosm) and applied to cells using a piezo-driven applicator (Siskiyou Piezo Switcher; Siskiyou Corp.). Electrodes had a resistance of 2–4 megaohms when filled with internal solution containing 140 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2, 315 mosm). Cells were lifted from the bottom of the culture dish by the patch clamp pipette to facilitate the solution exchange. Each drug application was done twice, and traces were averaged for analysis. Representative micrographs of GluA3-GFP-expressing HEK293 cells were acquired via an EVOS FL digital inverted microscope (AMG, Life Technologies) with a GFP LED light cube (570-nm excitation, 525-nm emission) and 20× objective. Transfected cells were extracted in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Detergent-soluble and non-soluble receptor fractions were determined from the immunoreactivity present in the supernatant and in the pellet, respectively. They were quantitated as described below. Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchonic acid assay (Uptima, Interchim, France) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Immunoprecipitation, cell surface biotinylation, and analysis of the secretion of ligand binding domain were performed as described previously (13.Coleman S.K. Möykkynen T. Cai C. von Ossowski L.

Briefly, transfected HEK293 cells were rinsed with PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and incubated with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) at 0.5 mg/ml in the above buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Non-reacted reagent was removed by washing cells with the above buffer. Triton X-100 extracts were made as described above and subject to streptavidin-Sepharose precipitation (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation was done as described (21.Coleman S.K. Cai C. Mottershead D.G. Haapalahti J.P. Keinänen K. Surface expression of GluR-D AMPA receptor is dependent on an interaction between its C-terminal domain and a 4.1 protein.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 798-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Triton X-100 extracts of transfected cells were incubated with pre-washed Gamma-bind Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and appropriate antibody (at concentration detailed above) and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C. Secretion of GluA2 and GluA3 LBD constructs was analyzed as described (23.Coleman S.K. Möykkynen T. Jouppila A. Koskelainen S. Rivera C. Korpi E.R. Keinänen K.

Briefly, growth medium was collected from transfected HEK293 cells 40 h after transfection, and 1 mm PMSF was added. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (1500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The total cell extracts were prepared as above. Gradients were prepared by layering 10% (w/v) sucrose in TNE buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 with >40% (w/v) sucrose solution (1:1 ratio) and incubating horizontally for 75 min at room temperature. Thus prepared gradients were stored vertically at 4 °C until use. Transfected HEK293 cell extracts (300 μl) were layered on top of the gradients that were run in pairs in an ultracentifuge with a Sw-55Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter) at 175,000 × g for 16 h at +4 °C. Fractions (200 μl) were collected from the bottom of centrifuge tube by using a peristaltic pump (GE Healthcare P-1). Samples were run on either Lonza 4–12% or Bio-Rad 4–15% TGX Criterion gradient gels for both denaturing (SDS) or blue native (BN)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For SDS-PAGE samples were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer (with final concentration of 60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 12.5 mm EDTA 0.01% bromphenol blue). BN-PAGE was run according to the protocol of Gill et al. (24.Gill M.B. Vivithanaporn P. Swanson G.T. Glutamate binding and conformational flexibility of ligand-binding domains are critical early determinants of efficient kainate receptor biogenesis.J. Biol.

After gel separation, proteins were transferred onto Hybond membrane (GE Healthcare) and immunoblotted. The samples used for BN-PAGE were obtained from the sucrose density gradients with the exception of the analysis of crude cell extracts. In the latter case Triton X-100 extracts prepared from transfected cells were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, mixed with native loading buffer, and used for electrophoresis. For immunoblotting, ClarityTM Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad, 170-5061) was used. ECL signal was detected and measured either by the ChemiDoc XRS system and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) or by BioSpectrum 810 and VisionWorksLS software (Ultra-Violet Products Ltd). The pixel density of the immunoreactive bands was obtained from the longest possible exposure before saturation of signal. If required the relative expression levels were normalized to a control, as defined in the respective figure legend. For determination of the percentage of oligomeric state after BN-PAGE, the signal was summed from boxes corresponding to aggregate, tetramer, dimer, and monomer for all fractions run (see Fig. 7A, middle panel). An equivalent box for background only was also measured; if this corresponded to 5% or more of the total signal the experiment was discarded. His6-tagged proteins were expressed and purified according to standard procedures as described previously (25.Cai C. Coleman S.K. Niemi K. Keinänen K.

The first round of purification from E. coli lysates was made via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) against the His6 tag. The proteins eluted from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer and then loaded on to a DEAE column (DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, GE Healthcare). After washing, proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl. All purified proteins were concentrated by centrifugal devices (microsep 30K, Pall Corp.) to ∼2 mg/ml and stored in elution buffer solution at 4 °C. Aliquots of bacterially expressed and purified GluA2 or GluA3 LBD proteins were incubated with increasing concentrations of urea (0–8 m) in the presence or absence of 10 mm l-glutamate. Intrinsic fluorescence at the 300–450-nm region produced by excitation at 295 ± 5 nm was measured in quartz cuvettes (Hellma) using a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Scientific) and analyzed by Origin 7.5 software. For calculation of the urea denaturation curves, peak emission intensities at 325 nm and 327 nm were used for GluA2 and GluA3 LBDs, respectively. Fluorescence intensity was plotted against urea concentration and individually best-fit with the sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope and no constraints) model in GraphPad Prism v4 (GraphPad Software Ltd.). For CD spectroscopy protein samples were dialyzed overnight against sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) followed by centrifugation (5 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C). Thermal stability of the GluA2i, GluA3i, and GluA3i (Y454A/R461G) LBDs was monitored by CD spectroscopy using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Thermal denaturation scans were recorded using a 0.1-cm cuvette, wavelength 195 nm, a temperature range from 20 °C to 70 °C with temperature steps of 0.1 °C. The protein concentration was 0.2 mg/ml. CD spectra were measured in the presence and absence of l-glutamate at 1 mm for GluA3i and GluA3i (Y454A/R461G) and 0.5 mm for GluA2i. Data were compiled in Excel (Microsoft Office 2007). The spectra were plotted, and Tm was calculated with GraphPad Prism v4 (GraphPad Software Ltd). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. unless otherwise stated and described, where n is the number of independent experiments. Analysis was by Student's t test or by one or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test or by Dunnett's multiple comparison test to control. Statistical significance of p values was indicated by asterisks as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. All statistical analyses were done by using GraphPad Prism. Analysis of desensitization kinetics of patch clamp recordings was done by Clampfit 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using single exponential fit paradigm. Previously, we showed that co-expression with GluA2-flip (GluA2i) promotes the surface expression of the otherwise mostly intracellularly retained GluA3i in transfected HEK293 cells (12.Coleman S.K. Möykkynen T. Hinkkuri S. Vaahtera L. Korpi E.R. Pentikäinen O.T. Keinänen K. Ligand-binding domain determines endoplasmic reticulum exit of AMPA receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36032-36039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We now analyzed the ability of GluA2 isoforms flip and flop (GluA2o) and of the GluA2i point mutant GluA2i A451Y/G458R (GluA2i AG/YR) to promote GluA3i surface expression as determined by biotinylation assay. Biotinylation with the cell-impermeant biotin derivative interferes with immunoreactivity of extracellular epitopes, so a GFP tag was introduced to the C terminus of the receptor polypeptide. This C-terminal fusion did not alter the basic trafficking of GluA2 and GluA3, as GluA2i-GFP showed significant surface expression, whereas only a minor fraction of Glu3i-GFP was present on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). Thus, GluA3i-GFP was expressed in HEK293 cells together with the FLAG-tagged test constructs GluA3i (control), GluA2i, GluA2o, or GluA2i (AG/YR). After surface biotinylation and streptavidin pulldown, GluA3i-GFP was visualized by immunoblotting (Fig. 1, B and C). Consistent with earlier findings, heteromeric assembly improved the surface expression of the GluA3i; in the presence of GluA2i, plasma membrane levels of GluA3i-GFP increased 6-fold. Co-expression with the flop isoform of GluA2 and with the AG/YR double mutants that carry the two residues responsible for the intracellular retention of GluA3 did not the increase surface expression of GluA3i-GFP in a statistically significant manner (Fig. 1C). To determine whether GluA3 displays a significant preference for heteromeric over homomeric assembly, N-terminally tagged GluA2i and GluA3i were expressed with a differently tagged version of the same or the other subunit and subjected to immunoprecipitation. FLAG-tagged GluA3i was co-immunoprecipitated with myc-tagged GluA3i or GluA2i and vice versa to a similar extent. Thus, suggesting that under the experimental conditions of transient expression in HEK293 cells GluA3 had no significant preference for heteromeric assembly (Fig. 1D). In addition to co-assembly, association with auxiliary proteins is known to promote surface expression of AMPA receptors. Therefore, we studied whether co-expression with stargazin (a prototype member of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins) would promote the trafficking of GluA3 to the plasma membrane. Previously, we have shown that stargazin rescues the otherwise poor surface expression of the flop variants of GluA1 and GluA4 homomers (13.Coleman S.K. Möykkynen T. Cai C. von Ossowski L. Kuismanen E. Korpi E.R. Keinänen K. Isoform-specific early trafficking of AMPA receptor flip and flop variants.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11220-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, despite strong expression and surface location of stargazin, no significant improvement was seen for GluA3 (Fig. 2, A and B). Due to this unexpected result, it was important to verify the association of stargazin with GluA3. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments did not show statistically a significant difference in stargazin association between GluA3 and GluA2 (Fig. 2C). Whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology on transfected HEK293 cells did not show a statistically significant increase in the maximal whole-cell currents in the presence of stargazin (Fig. 2D). However, when stargazin was co-expressed, the desensitization of glutamate responses was significantly slower; time constants (τdes values) for the onset of desensitization were 10.48 ms ± 1.11 for GluA3+Stg (Stg, stargazin) and 4.50 ms ± 0.38 GluA3 for GluA3 alone, indicating functional association of stargazin with GluA3 (Fig. 2E). Ligand binding domains of GluA2 and GluA3, expressed as soluble secretable fusion proteins, reproduce the trafficking difference between the subunits (12.Coleman S.K. Möykkynen T. Hinkkuri S. Vaahtera L. Korpi E.R. Pentikäinen O.T. Keinänen K. Ligand-binding domain determine"

I write letters to help them win awards, internships, and placements in study abroad programs. I write letters for graduate students trying to win fellowships, find postdoc appointments, and secure tenure-track positions. I write letters for faculty members submitting applications for prizes, as well as for those coming up for tenure and promotion appraisals. Suffice it to say, I spend a lot of time writing letters.

> “We need to write fewer letters.” 

Maybe I should feel good about this—after all, I am helping a lot of people achieve their dreams—but I don't. It isn't that I don't wish the people I am writing for well—I do. They often succeed in their applications, and I like to think that my letters play an important part in this. However, I am beginning to question the value of all this letter writing. I certainly don't mean to sound ungracious. Yes, many people have written letters on my behalf. Yes, without these letters I wouldn't be where I am today. But I became an academic to be a scholar and a teacher. I didn't sign up to be a letter writer.

Even as I am sometimes exasperated with my own letter-writing load, I was surprised to learn that, compared with other colleagues I have talked to, the 50 or so letters I am now writing each year is probably average. One colleague told me that he knows someone who routinely writes several hundred letters each year. Others probably write more. This is work we in the academy all feel obliged to do—but lately, as I serve on more of the hiring and award committees that request all these letters, I find myself wondering whether they are losing value.

In the past, there were fewer universities than today, and networks were smaller. A letter of reference mattered because it was written by someone the letter reader knew. Now, we are reading hundreds of letters of reference, most by people we don't know. Maybe we have heard of the letter writer's research and have met once or twice at a conference, but still, we often have no sense of what a letter from that individual means. Is “good” high or faint praise? When is “brilliant” honest and when is it hyperbole? Is this a form letter? Does the fact that a letter was written by a big-name scholar employed at a big-name school indicate that the subject of the letter is doing quality work or merely that they are well connected? And should we discount a letter if there are typos or grammatical mistakes? In the end, a strong letter can simply mean a strong letter writer.

Indeed, now that I have served on committees faced with hundreds of letters, each describing said candidate as “outstanding” or some other superlative, I find myself paying less and less attention to them. Although we used to look to letters to get a sense of someone's scholarly promise, in today's competitive academic arena, promise is no longer enough. Instead, we end up relying on markers of achievement—CV, transcript, proposal, scholarly output—as do the writers of all those letters.

Last month, Roger Day wrote on this page that some academics need to stop using others to ghostwrite their letters. (You can read that story at .) But we don't just need more diligent letter writers or more honesty about who is doing the letter writing. We need to write fewer letters. I think it's time we consider retiring the letter of reference. Professors' labor isn't free; our time must be allocated and paid for, to say nothing of the time spent by contingent faculty members who are asked to write letters on their own dime. Although the price of a single letter may seem low, the cost of the time faculty members are spending reading and writing all these letters probably amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

Yes, it would be nice to have highly insightful letters that provide valuable information about a candidate beyond what comes through from a CV or written work. But if you are on a committee that does admissions or any other form of adjudication and you request letters, ask yourself this: Will the decision you make be that much better?

https://openalex.org/W2274358056,"This retrospective study aimed to identify if the existence of the accessory parotid gland correlated with the etiology of parotitis. This may aid the development of better treatment strategies in the future. Sialographic features of cases with parotitis and healthy subjects were reviewed. The chi-square test was used to compare the incidence of accessory parotid gland between the groups. The Student’s t test was used to compare the length of Stensen’s duct, the length from the orifice to the confluence of the accessory duct, and the angle between the accessory duct and Stensen’s duct between the groups. The incidence of accessory parotid gland in patients with parotitis was 71.8% (28/39), which was significantly higher than that in healthy subjects (P = 0.005). Patients with parotitis had a longer Stensen’s duct than healthy subjects (P = 0.003). There was no significant difference in the length from the orifice to the confluence of the accessory duct or the angle between the accessory duct and Stensen’s duct (P = 0.136 and 0.511, respectively) between the groups. The accessory parotid gland might play a role in the pathogenesis of parotitis. The existence of an accessory parotid gland is likely to interfere with salivary flow. Computational fluid dynamics analysis of salivary flow in the ductal system would be useful in future etiologic studies on parotitis."
https://openalex.org/W2277741056,"For months, the four scientific instruments at the heart of the James Webb Space Telescope have been sealed in what looks like a huge cooker. It's a test chamber that simulates the grueling operating conditions they will face after Webb is launched into orbit in 2018. But in fact, pressure cooker is an apt metaphor for the whole project. The infrared Webb observatory is the biggest, most complex, and most expensive science mission that NASA has ever attempted. Like that of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, Webb's construction has been plagued by redesigns, schedule slips, and cost overruns that have strained relationships with contractors, international partners, and supporters in the U.S. Congress. Lately the project has largely stuck to its schedule and its $8 billion budget. But plenty could still go wrong, and the stakes are high: Both the future of space-based astronomy and NASA's ability to build complex science missions depend on its success."
https://openalex.org/W2269430635,"One morning in 1979, while cycling toward the University of Cambridge laboratory where I was in the second year of my chemistry Ph.D. program, I noticed the vendors setting up their stalls in the market square. “Every damn day,” I thought as I rolled quietly past. “They do the same thing every damn day.” A wave of gloom swept through me. How could anyone get up each morning to do the same thing every day? Science was one of my passions, but the setbacks of research were beginning to grind me down, and I was realizing that actually doing science was not for me. By the time I reached the lab that day, I knew that I needed to do something different with my life than chase the “regular” job in academia or industry that I was being encouraged to prepare for.

> “The way forward seemed clear: I should become a science writer.” 

My other passion was writing, so the way forward seemed clear: I should become a science writer. As I continued my Ph.D. studies, I began to pitch short articles to a popular science magazine. The rejections I initially received stung as much as the frustrations and failures of scientific research, but I persisted. I pondered some tough advice from a couple of helpful editors, and eventually I began to regularly see my words in print. When I graduated, I decided I wanted to become a writer. I was on my way to a career that brought me little more glory than research would have—but far more satisfaction.

Few fledgling freelance science writers can survive by writing alone. I certainly couldn't. Teaching seemed an obvious source of additional income, and I was soon explaining basic science to youngsters at a small local college. Although the resources at my disposal were a far cry from what I had been used to in my research training, I came to enjoy the interaction with the students, and I soon became a regular member of the part-time teaching team. Teaching for part of the week and writing the rest of the time kept me intellectually stimulated, and I enjoyed the variety. I also found that teaching kept me aware of the difficulties many encounter in understanding science, which helped me when writing for a general audience. But while most of my former university colleagues seemed to be prospering financially, I was just scraping by.

I had the naive impression that if I could write a book, I would make some money, so I was overjoyed when an editor who had read a magazine article I had written about viruses invited me to expand it into a book for the general public. After a year of effort, my book was published and received excellent reviews, which supported my belief that I was on my way to riches. This prospect was further reinforced when I wandered into a large London bookshop and was astonished to discover more than 20 copies of my book. I was told that it was a recommended text at the University of London.

Despite the excitement I felt, reality kicked in when I realized that—even with great reviews, academic recommendations, and eventual translations into many languages—I was never going to earn enough from writing as a freelancer to live by that alone. I have now published nine science books, including two textbooks for major academic publishers in the United States, but I remain a hybrid writer-lecturer. I have not achieved the level of sales success that I had hoped for, but I have found a way to remain involved in science. I also hugely enjoy self-publishing my fiction, even though the readers of this work are relatively few.

It now occurs to me that in some ways, my life in science writing has been very similar to the lives of many science graduates who stay in research. Our driving force is a passion for what we do, but in the same way that my books are falling out of date and out of print, most research papers soon sink into the swamps of the rarely cited and the never applied. Most of us, whatever path we choose through science, must be ready to be content with a life in the shadows rather than in the limelight. But such a life, I have found, can still be fun and fulfilling.
