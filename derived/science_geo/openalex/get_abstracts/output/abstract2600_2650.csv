https://openalex.org/W1530473730,"The proteolytic degradation of 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein by monolayers of cultured human fibroblasts was prevented by exposure of the cells to chloroquine, an agent that has been reported previously to inhibit lysosomal degradative processes. Chloroquine did not inhibit the binding of low density lipoprotein to its cell surface receptor. However, the two regulatory actions that normally follow low density lipoprotein binding to its receptor, namely suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and stimulation of cholesteryl ester formation, were both prevented when degradation of the lipoprotein was inhibited by chloroquine. Two other agents affecting lysosomal function, Triton WR 1339 and concanavalin A, also inhibited the proteolytic degradation of low density lipoprotein in intact fibroblasts and simultaneously prevented low density lipoprotein-mediated suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and stimulation of cholesteryl ester formation. Unlike chloroquine, however, these two agents also affect the binding of low density lipoprotein to the cells. The inhibitory action of chloropuine, concanavalin A, and Triton WR 1339 could each be reversed by removal of the agent from the culture medium. These in vivo culture data, together with the observation that cell-free extracts of fibroblasts maximally degrade 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein at pH 4 and do not form acid-soluble material above pH 6, are consistent with the hypothesis that the proteolytic degradation of low density lipoprotein by monolayers of fibroblasts occurs within lysosomes. The data also suggest that normal lysosomal function is required in order for low density lipoprotein to regulate cholesterol synthesis and cholesteryl ester formation in the fibroblast system."
https://openalex.org/W1573042704,"Mutants of Saccharomyces cereviaiae showing defects in cytochrome oxidase, coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase, and rutamycin-sensitive ATPase are described. The mutations have been established to be nuclear, based on complementation with a cytoplasmic petite tester strain and 2:2 segregation of tetrads. Genetic analysis indicate the coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome oxidase mutants fall into 9 and 10 different complementation groups, respectively. The mutants also form distinct classes based on absorption spectra of the mitochondrial cytochromes. Two of the ATPase mutants lack detectable F1 ATPase, while the third synthesizes F1 but does not integrate it into a membrane complex. The latter mutant is missing one of the mitochondrially synthesized subunits of the rutamycin-sensitive ATPase complex."

https://openalex.org/W2125032912,"As it was shown previoulsy by others, the membrane-bound phosphodiesterase (cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase) of rat epididymal fat cells was stimulated when intact cells were exposed to insulin. The levels of stimulation observed in the present study in the homogenate and microsomal fraction were approximately 2.0- to 2.5-fold and 2.5- to 3.0-fold, respectively, when the initial substrate level was 100 nM and insulin concentration was 1 to 3 nM. When the microsomal fraction was subjected to a sucrose density gradient centrifugation, most of the insulin-sensitive phosphodiesterase activity was fractionated into the light microsomal fraction which was rich in NADH2:potassium ferricyanide:oxidoreductase) and low in 5'-AMPase, adenylate cyclase, and insulin-binding activities. The latter three activities were mostly fractionated into the microsomal fraction. Both basal and insulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase activities were low when cells were homogenized in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide or p-chloromercuribenzoate. The insulin-stimulated enzyme activity was also low when cells were homogenized in the presence of --SH compounds (e.g. dithiothreitol) or certain metal-chelating agents (e.g. ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ehter)-N,N'-tetraacetate (EGTA)), or in a nitrogen atmosphere. The effect of EGTA was prevented by the addition of certain heavy metal ions but not by the addition of Ca2+ or Ca2+ plus Mg2+ ions. When cells were homogenized in the presence of certain oxidants (e.g. diamide, sodium tetrathionate, or air), a high plus-insulin activity was observed; this activity was not lowered by subsequent treatment of the enzyme with N-ethylmaleimede, EGTA, or fresh homogenate that was prepared in the presence of EGTA. However, the activity of an apparently oxidized enzyme could still be lowered by treatment woth dithiothreitol. A partially purified enzyme in the enzyme in the microsomal fraction was fairly stable both in basal and insulin-stimulated states (fully active after 35 days when kept at -20degrees). EGTA added to the homogenization buffer lowered the basal phosphodiesterase activity, but this effect was reversed by the addition of Ca2+ ions. EGTA also decreased the enzyme activity that was stimulated by norepinephrine. However, neither EGTA nor dithiothreitol had any effect on the activities of 5'-AMPase, NADH-dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase of fat cells. The above data indicate that most of the insulin-sensitive phosphodiesterase and the so-called cell membrane markers are associated with different subcellular particles in the homogenate. In addition, the data seem to indicate that the insulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase has certain --SH groups and that the activity of the enzyme is stabilized when the --SH groups are oxidized by certain oxidants including molecular oxygen. It is suggested that the air oxidation of the enzyme is catalyzed by a trace of certain heavy metal ions and, therefore, can be blocked by a metal-chelating agent."

https://openalex.org/W1523371050,"A new adenosine analogue has been synthesized, 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine, which reacts covalently with bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase with the incorporation of approximately 1 mol of 5'-sulfonylbenzoyl adenosine per peptide chain. Native glutamate dehydrogenase is known to be inhibited by relatively high concentrations of DPNH by binding to a second noncatalytic site; the major change in the kinetic characteristics of the modified enzyme is a total loss of this inhibition by DPNH. The modified enzyme retains full catalytic activity as measured in the absence of allosteric ligands, is still inhibited more than 90% by GTP, and is activated normally by ADP. These results demonstrate that the catalytic as well as the GTP and ADP regulatory sites are distinct from the inhibitory DPNH site. The rate constant for reaction of 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine is decreased by high concentrations of DPNH alone or by DPNH plus GTP, but not by the substrate alpha-ketoglutarate, the coenzymes DPN or TPNH, or the regulators ADP or GTP alone. These observations are consistent with the postulate that the 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine attacks exclusively the second inhibitory DPNH site. The DPNH inhibition is abolished when an average of only 0.5 mol of 5'-sulfonylbenzoyl adenosine per peptide chain has been incorporated. The structure of 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine is critical in determining the course of the modification reaction. The smaller compound p-fluorosulfonylbenzoic acid does not affect the kinetic characteristics of the enzyme, and the isomeric compound 3'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine produces a different pattern of changes in the regulatory properties (Pal. P. K., Wechter, W. J., and Colman, R. F. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 707-715). Indeed, enzyme which has combined stoichiometrically with 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine is still able to react with 3'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine; thus, the two adenosine analogues appear to react at distinct sites on glutamate dehydrogenase. It is proposed that 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine will be complementary to 3'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine as a general affinity label for dehydrogenases as well as other classes of enzymes which use adenine nucleotides as substrates or regulators."

https://openalex.org/W1499962811,"Four alternative structures occur at the 5' ends of vesicular stomatitis virus mRNAs synthesized in infected cells and are separated conveniently by a technique described here. Sixty-five to seventy per cent of the mRNA molecules have the 5' end structure m7G5'ppp5'(m)AmpAp and about 20% have a more highly modified structure m7G5'ppp5'(m)AmpmAmpCp. The base of the first adenosine in each sequence is methylated in about one-half of the ends of each type and kinetic experiments suggest that the latter sequence is derived from the former by further methylations. The remaining 10 to 15% of the 5' ends are pppAp and pppGp in approximately equimolar yields. This heterogeneity with respect to 5' end structure is found within each of the vesicular stomatitis virus mRNA species examined. The mRNA molecules with 5'-triphosphate ends accumulate throughout the infection but are not found on ribosomes, suggesting that they lack a structure(s) required for ribosome recognition. In contrast to mRNA, virion RNA has a single 5' end structure, pppAp."
https://openalex.org/W1516286467,"Cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate added to the starvation media of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae induces both intracellular and extracellular phosphodiesterase activities of these cells. The induced enzyme activity appears several hours earlier than that in starved cells which have not been induced with cyclic nucleotide. In both cases, the appearance of enzyme is inhibited by cycloheximide, and actinomycin D, and daunomycin. The KmS for the extracellular enzyme(s) of nucleotide-induced and uninduced control cells are identical. The induction of enzyme activity seems specific for cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate since cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate, as well as other nucleotides, have no effect. No differences in the activity or excretion of either N-acetylglucosaminidase or the inhibitory of the extracellular phosphodiesterase are observed between cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-induced and control cells. A direct activation of phosphodiesterase by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate can be excluded, since the addition of this nucleotide to cell lysates has no effect on the enzyme activity."

https://openalex.org/W1545769010,"Azotobacter vinelandii (4Fe-4S)2 ferredoxin I (Fd I) is an electron transfer protein with Mr equals 14,500 and Eo equals -420 mv. It exhibits and EPR signal of g equals 2.01 in its isolated form. This resonance is almost identical with the signal that originates from a super-oxidized state of the 4Fe-4S cluster of potassium ferricyanide-treated Clostridium ferredoxin. A cluster that exhibits this EPR signal at g equals 2.01 is in the same formal oxidation state as the cluster in oxidized Chromatium High-Potential-Iron-Protein (HiPIP). On photoreduction of Fd I with spinach chloroplast fragments, the resonance at g equals 2.01 vanishes and no EPR signal is observed. This EPR behavior is analogous to that of reduced HiPIP, which also fails to exhibit an EPR spectrum. These characteristics suggest that a cluster in A. vinelandii Fd I functions between the same pair of states on reduction as does the cluster in HiPIP, but with a midpoint reduction potential of -420 mv in contrast to the value of +350 mv characteristic of HiPIP. Quantitative EPR and stoichoimetry studies showed that only one 4Fe-4S cluster in this (4Fe-4S)2 ferredoxin is reduced. Oxidation of Fd I with potassium ferricyanide results in the uptake of 1 electron/mol as determined by quantitative EPR spectroscopy. This indicates that a cluster in Fd I shows no electron paramagnetic resonance in the isolated form of the protein accepts an electron on oxidation, as indicated by the EPR spectrum, and becomes paramagnetic. The EPR behavior of this oxidizable cluster indicates that it also functions between the same pair of oxidation states as does the Fe-S cluster in HiPIP. The midpoint reduction potential of this cluster is approximately +340 mv. A. vinelandii Fd I is the first example of an iron-sulfur protein which contains both a high potential cluster (approximately +340 mv) and a low potential cluster (-420 mv). Both Fe-S clusters appear to function between the same pair of oxidation states as the single Fe-S cluster in Chromatium HiPIP, although the midpoint reduction potentials of the two clusters are approximately 760 mv different."
https://openalex.org/W1579417853,"Human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase has been found to be capable of hydrolyzing p-nitrophenyl esters. Esterase and dehydrogenase activities exhibited identical ion exchange and affinity properties, indicating that the same protein catalyzes both reactions. Competitive inhibition of esterase activity by glyceraldehyde and chloral hydrate furnished evidence that p-nitrophenyl acetate was hydrolyzed at the aldehyde binding site for dehydrogenase activity. Pyridine nucleotides modified esterase activity; NAD+ accelerated the rate of p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis more that 5-fold, whereas NADH increased activity by a factor of 2. Activation constants of 117 muM for NAD+ and 3.5 muM for NADH were obtained from double reciprocal plots of initial rates as a function of modifier concentration at pH 7. The kinetics of activation of ester hydrolysis were consistent with random addition of pyridine nucleotide modifier and ester substrate to this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1954441207,"Sugars and other energy sources were found to lower intracellular concentrations of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium which were deficient for cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. This effect required the presence of the specific transport system responsible for entry of that sugar into the cell and depended on the intracellular catabolic enzymes. Metabolizable sugars were more effective than nonmetabolizable sugars in reducing cellular cyclic AMP levels, and this reduction was blocked partially by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. Electron donors such as lactate and ascorbate plus phenazine methosulfate reduced internal cyclic AMP levels in bacterial membrane vesicles which had been preloaded with the cyclic nucleotide. Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, but not arsenate, blocked the energy-stimulated loss of intravesicular cyclic AMP. Employing intact cells, sugars were shown to have two primary effects on cyclic AMP metabolism: (a) they inhibited net synthesis of the cyclic nucleotide while promoting its degradation, and (b) they stimulated efflux of cyclic AMP into the extracellular fluid. While the former effect was elicited by metabolizable and nonmetabolizable sugars alike, stimulation of cyclic nucleotide excretion was only observed with metabolizable sugars. The results suggest that the extrusion of cyclic AMP from the bacterial cell is energy-dependent and is driven by an energized membrane state."

https://openalex.org/W1963551393,"C3H/He mice chronically infected with murine cytomegalovirus were given skin allografts from histoincompatible BALB/c donors. A significant increase in cytomegalovirus titers occurred within 3 days after placement of the graft in the spleens and kidneys of the allograft recipients as compared with control animals. No significant changes in virus titers were detected in the salivary gland, lung, liver, or blood of allograft recipients. These results indicate that the host-versus-graft reaction alone can enhance murine cytomegalovirus in a chronically infected host and may help explain the high incidence of cytomegalovirus infection seen after renal and other allograft transplantation in man."
https://openalex.org/W1495756500,"Detailed studies of the mechanism of action of the novel oligoribonuclease of Escherichia coli described in the previous paper (1) led to the following conclusions. 1. The enzyme prefers a free 3'-hydroxyl group for its action. 2. The enzyme attacks the oligoribonucleotide substrate in a sequential manner from the 3' end producing 5'-ribonucleotides. 3. The mode of attack appears to be processive; the enzyme acts by degrading one oligoribonucleotide chain to completion before proceeding to the hydrolysis of another chain. 4. The reaction rate is inversely proportional to the chain length of the substrate; however, the enzyme has a higher affinity for longer chains. 5. The enzyme activity is markedly inhibited by secondary structure; oligoribonucleotides combined with complementary polyribonucleotides are attacked poorly below the melting temperature of the complex and efficiently above the melting temperature. 6. The enzyme is inhibited by 5'-nucleotides of adenine and guanine; those of cytosine and uracil have a much smaller effect. The enzyme is not inhibited by 3'-nucleotides. 7. Studies with dinucleoside monophosphate show highest reaction rates with pyrimidine sequences in the order: CpCgreater than UpUgreater than CpUgreater than UpC. The presence of guanine at the 3' end is strongly inhibitory, and reaction rates are CpGgreater than UpG=ApGgreater than GpG."

The apparent Ka values for guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate and adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate were determined to be about 17 and 360 nM, respectively. Mg2+ was essential for the activity exhibiting biphasic stimulation behavior and neither Mn2+ nor Ca2+ could substitute for Mg2+.

An acid-labile phosphorylated decapeptide has been purified from a tryptic digest of the phosphoenzyme. The amino acid sequence of the peptide has been determined to be: Aal-Gly-Gln-Leu-Asp-Glu-Ser-His-Arg.

https://openalex.org/W2005693214,"TYPE C viruses of the RD-114 (ref. 1) group have been isolated, either spontaneously or after chemical induction, from cell cultures of the domestic cat (Felis catus)2–4. Nucleic acid sequences related to the RD-114 genome are in the DNA of all domestic cats5–8. Thus these viral genomes are transmitted vertically from parent to offspring as integral components of cat cellular DNA. Although the family Felidae consists of closely related animals, only four Felis species have been found to contain RD-114-related sequences. These include the domestic cat, the European wildcat (F. sylvestris), the sand cat (F. margarita), and the jungle cat (F. chaus); other members of the Felidae lack nucleic acid sequences related to RD-114 (ref. 9). The observation that RD-114 is partially related to the endogenous baboon type C viruses10–12 and that sequences related to RD-114 are found in the cellular DNA of all Old World monkeys led to the postulate that this group of viruses originated from an endogenous primate type C virus13 transmitted horizontally to the germ line of ancestors of certain Felis species during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene somewhere in the region of the Mediterranean basin9."
https://openalex.org/W1510421996,"Treatment of hamster BHK cells with N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (Bt2cAMP), aminophylline, theophylline, or papaverine increased the level of aryl hydrocarbon (benzo(a)pyrene) hydrolxylase activity. The highese increase, 100-fold, was obtained with Bt2cAMP plus aminophylline or theophylline. N2,O2-Dibutyryl guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate gave a lower induction than Bt2cAMP. The level of hydroxylase activity started to decrease 6 hours after treatment with the inducer and was reduced to almost the uninduced level after 24 hours. Repeated addition of Bt2cAMP and aminophylline did not prevent this decrease. The hydroxylase can also be induced by treating cells with benz(a)anthracene, and the level of this induced activity was maintained for 24 hours. Aminophylline gave a 2- to 8-fold stimulation of the induction by benz(a)anthracene. The enzyme activity induced by Bt2cAMP, aminophylline, and benz(a)anthracene converted benzo(a)pyrene to similar alkali-extractable metabolities with a fluorescence spectra similar to that of 3-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene. These induced enzyme activities also showed a similar heat stability. Induction by Bt2cAMP and aminophylline, like induction by benz(a)anthracene, required continued protein synthesis and only an initial period of RNA synthesis. Compared to the benz(a)anthracene-induced hydroxylase with a Km of 4.3 muM, the hydroxylase induced by Bt2cAMP and aminophylline showed a Km of 0.14 muM, and was 100-fold more sensitive to inhibition by 7,8-benzoflavone. Increasing the serum concentration in the culture medium stimulated the induction by aminophylline but did not stimulate induction by benz(a)anthracene. The results indicate that aryl hydrocaarbon (benzo(a)pyrene) hydroxylase can be induced by compounds that increase the level of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and that this induction and induced enzyme activity differs from that caused by benz(a)anthracene."
https://openalex.org/W1547308737,"Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase (EC 2.7.6.1) was purified to virtual homogeneity from Salmonella typhimurium cells by a modification of previously published procedures. The molecular weight of the subunit was determined to be 31,000 +/- 3,000 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the enzyme dissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The amino acid composition of the enzyme was determined. Proline was identified as the only NH2-terminal residue. PRPP synthetase is apparently composed of identical or nearly identical subunits. NATIVE PRPP synthetase exists in multiple states of aggregation under all conditions. However, two predominant states were demonstrated under certain conditions. A form with molecular weight of 320,000 +/- 20,000 was found at pH 7.5 in the presence of MgATP. At pH 8.2 to 8.6, with or without MgATP, the predominant form corresponded to a molecular weight of 150,000 to 200,000; sedimentation equilibrium and velocity analysis indicated 160,000 +/- 15,000 as the most reliable molecular weight. More highly aggregated forms were observed at 4 degrees and higher protein concentrations. Removal of inorganic phosphate from PRPP synthetase by dilution or dialysis resulted in disaggregation. The fundamental unit of PRPP synthetase appears to consist of five (or possibly six) subunits, which can associate to form a dimer (10 or 12 subunits) and more highly aggregated forms. A pentameric subunit structure is consistent with the multiple species resolved by electrophoresis of the native enzyme in discontinuous polyacrylamide gel systems. Visualization of PRPP synthetase by negative staining with uranyl acetate and electron microscopy revealed fields of very asymmetric molecules, the dimensions of which corresponded to the M = 160,000 form. Dimers and higher aggregates of this unit were also seen. An unusual model, in which the five subunits are asymmetrically arranged, accounts very well for the electron microscopic appearance of the enzyme. The tendency of the enzyme to aggregate is viewed as a consequence of the unsatisfied bonding regions of the fundamental asymmetric unit."

https://openalex.org/W1596671720,"Adenylate cyclase and the [8-lysine]vasopressin receptor were solubilized from pig kidney medulla membranes using the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. Optimal conditions for solubilization were under continuous stirring in a medium containing 0.5% (/v) Triton X-100, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 10 mM MgCl2. Both adenylate cyclase activity and [3H][8-lysine]vasopressin binding activity were recovered in a -26,000 X g supernatant of detergent-treated membranes. The yield of solubilized adenylate cyclase was nearly 100%. The soluble enzyme was no longer sensitive to antidiuretic hormone but was slightly activated by sodium fluoride. The affinity of the soluble receptor for [8-lysine]vasopresin was les than that of the membrane-bound receptor (mean apparent Km values, respectively 10(-7) M and 2 X 10(-8) M), however binding cooperativity was preserved. Hill coefficients were 1.42 for the soluble receptor and 1.50 for the membrane receptor. The soluble receptor discriminated as efficiently as did the membrane receptor between [8-lysine-a1vasopressin and oxytocin. The yield of spolubilized receptor was only 30% despite the fact that all binding activity had disappeared from the residual pellet of detergent-treated membranes. When the membranous receptors were occupied before solubilization and the latter was performed under conditions in which dissociation of the hormone-receptor comples is slow, i.e. at low temperature, 65% to 100% of the hormone-receptor complex was recovered in the soluble fraction. The soluble hormone-receptor complex partially dissociated on rewarming whereas the free hormone concentration was kept unchanged in the medium. The residual binding capacity, which was 30% of the initial value, was identical with that determined when the receptor was solubilized in free form before incubation with labeled hormone. It was concluded that (a) solubilization of the receptor molecules was complete, (b) during solubilization two forms of the receptor appear, of which only one is accessible to the hormone, (c) occupancy of the receptor by the hormone prevented the formation of the nonaccessible form, and (d) some component or components of the soluble fraction might be responsible for the loss in apparent affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1563176594,"Steady state initial velocity studies were carried out to determine the kinetic mechanism of human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase. Intersecting double reciprocal plots obtained in the absence of inhibitors demonstrated that the dehydrogenase reaction proceeded by sequential addition of both substrates prior to release of products. Dead end inhibition patterns obtained with coenzyme and substrate analogues (e.g. thionicotinamide-AD+ and chloral hydrate) indicated that NAD+ and aldehyde can bind in random fashion. The patterns of inhibition by the product NADH and of substrate inhibition by glyceraldehyde were also consistent with this mechanism. However, comparisons between kinetic constants associated with the dehydrogenase and esterase activities of this enzyme suggested that most of the dehydrogenase reaction flux proceeds via formation of an initial binary NAD+-enzyme complex over a wide range of substrate and coenzyme concentrations."

Macrophages1, B lymphocytes2, activated T lymphocytes3 and certain tumour cells4 express such receptors which interact with the Fc portion of IgG (Fc receptors). I have shown that guinea pig macrophages are heterogeneous in their capacity to bind antibody, that the expression of Fc receptors is greatly increased during cell activation in vivo and in vitro and that this activation of receptor expression is inhibited by a factor(s) present in fresh autologous serum5. Here I show that changes in macrophage Fc receptor expression in vitro are modulated by insulin and by cyclic nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W2049459769,"A Mendelian mutation, r-1, in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been isolated which elevates protoporphyrin accumulation of the Mendelian protoporphyrin mutants brS-1 and brC-1 more than 20 fold. This increased protoporphyrin accumulation is shown to result from increased delta-aminolevulinic acid synthesis in the double mutants brS-1 r-1 and brC-1 r-1 over that of brS-1 and brC-1 alone. By itself, the r-1 mutation has no detectable protoporphyrin accumulation and has reduced levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthesizing activity, chlorophyll, protoheme, and cytochrome oxidase activity. The low levels of chlorophyll and protoheme in r-1 can be increased by feeding delta-aminolevulinic acid. We hypothesize that r-1 may be a mutation of the gene coding for the delta-aminolevulinic acid synthesizing enzyme which reduces the sensitivity of this enzyme to feedback inhibition by protoporphyrin or heme as well as reducing the overall activity of the enzyme. Evidence is also presented for a single delta-aminolevulinic acid synthesizing enzyme serving both chlorophyll and heme biosynthesis."

The existence of two active sites binding the aminoacyl adenylate intermediate was demonstrated by gel filtration and retention on DEAE-cellulose filters. Burst experiments indicated that two sites were involved in a rapid ATP consumption at conditions of catalytic amino acid activation. Furthermore, it was observed that the activated amino acid could be transferred from both sites to cognate tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1529320311,"Purification of pork renal cortex membranes yielded a particulate adenylate cyclase retaining good sensitivity to stimulation by parathyroid hormone and glucagon and a modest but significant response to porcine calcitonin. Treatment of this partially purified membrane fraction with 0.5% Lubrol PX and 5 mM NaF released adenylate cyclase activity into a fraction which was not sedimented by centrifugation for 20 min at 37,000 X g or for 2 hours at 100,000 X g and passed through a Millipore filter (0.22 mum pore). This solubilized adenylate cyclase was stimulated by porcine calcitonin and NaF but not by parathyroid hormone or glucagon. On gel filtration (Sephadex G-200) in the presence of 1mM dithiothreitol and 5mM NaF, the major portion of the adenylate cyclase activity eluted with the void volume of the column and showed 2.0-fold stimulation with 10 muM calcitonin. Binding of 125I-labeled porcine calcitonin was demonstrated in the 37,000 X g and the 100,000 X g supernatants. From 74 to 86% of the observed binding could be blocked by the addition of unlabeled porcine calcitonin to the reaction mixture. Addition of salmon calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, or glucagon blocked only 12 to 18% of the binding. The dose-response curves for inhibition of binding of iodinated calcitonin by unlabeled calcitonin and the activation of adenylate cyclase by the hormone each showed 50% maximal effect at a concentration between 4.5 and 8 muM porcine calcitonin and maximal effect at a concentration between 33 and 66 muM porcine calcitonin."
https://openalex.org/W1502119192,"We have studied the effect of Mg2+ on the formation of transcription preinitiation complexes (open complexes) at two adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP)-dependent promoters (lac and gal) and two phage lambda promoters, PL and PR. Mg2+ strongly interferes with open complex formation at the lac and gal promoters, partially inhibits the lambda PR promoter, and is without effect on the lambda PL promoter. Mutations in the lac and gal promoters can affect the response of the promoter to Mg2+. Cyclic AMP and CRP specifically reduce the inhibition of the lac and gal promoters by Mg2+. These factors also affect open complexes at lac and gal by (a) increasing the rate at which they are formed and (b) lowering the midpoint of the temperature transition curve for their formation by about 10 degrees. Open complexes at the lac promoter are more unstable to cooling, even in the presence of CRP and cyclic AMP, than open complexes at lambda promoters. Our studies suggest that the DNA of the lac and gal promoter regions is more resistant to denaturation than the DNA of phage promoter regions. Cyclic AMP and CRP act to decrease this stability, stimulating open complex formation under conditions unfavorable for DNA melting, e.g. low temperature and high Mg2+ concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2023339516,"THE coronavirus genome has been shown to comprise single-stranded RNA1,2. Examination of the viral nucleic acid synthesised by pig kidney cells infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) suggested that several molecular species, ranging in size between 18 and 28S, were involved in the viral replicative cycle3; similarly Tannock found a wide variation in the size of RNA molecules extracted from avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) by a phenol–sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) method2. Extraction of IBV RNA by 1% SDS at 60 °C has, however, revealed a single component of molecular weight 9×106 corresponding to 60S by electrophoresis through 2.2% polyacrylamide gels4."
https://openalex.org/W34717048,"Immunologic approaches to studying lipoprotein structure have been limited because the methods have not been quantitative enough. Recently we reported (Schonfeld, G., and Pfleger, B. (1974) J. Clin. Invest. 54, 236-246) a radioimmunoassay for human apoprotein A-1 (ApoA-I). Only 8% of the ApoA-I of high density lipoprotein (HDL) reacted in the radioimmunoassay system consisting of rabbit anti-human ApoA-I, 125I-ApoA-I, and unlabeled ApoA-I. We suggested that the ApoA-I in HDL were poorly reactive in the radioimmunoassay because they were masked by lipid- or protein-protein interactions. To test this, were reconstituted from lipids and apoproteins and assayed for their reactivity in the radioimmunoassay. Apo-HDL, ApoA-I alone, or ApoA-I + ApoA-II were sonified with lecithin or with lipids extracted from HDL. Sonicates were fractionated by ultracentrifugation or by Sepharose 4B chromatography. HDLs were also made by incubating dispersed lecithin or lecithin + cholesterol with Apo-HDL, ApoA-I, or ApoA-II. The lipoproteins were analyzed for lipids and protein chemically. Apoprotein compositions were determined by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. ApoA-I content by radioimmunoassay then was compared with the ApoA-I content obtained by disc gel electrophoresis. Most reconstituted had less than the expected ApoA-I contents. Discrepancies between ApoA-I contents were greatest for lipoproteins prepared from Apo-HDL and HDL-lipids (20 to 30% of expected contents). Discrepancies were smaller for particles prepared with lecithin, with ApoA-I alone or with ApoA-I + ApoA-II (40 to 85% of expected). HDLs made by incubation were less reactive than those prepared by sonication. Thus, the reactivity of ApoA-I in the radioimmunoassay could be diminished by causing it to interact with lipids or their apoproteins, or both, suggesting that antigenic sites became masked. From this one can extrapolate that the poor reactivity of the ApoA-I in HDL isolated from plasma also may have been due to the masking of some of its antigenic determinants. The identification of the determinants involved awaits the development of radioimmunoassays for specific regions of ApoA-I."
https://openalex.org/W1480056934,"In Bacillus subtilis shikimate kinase enzyme activity can be demonstrated when a small polypeptide forms a trifunctional complex with the bifunctional enzyme 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthetase-chorismate mutase. The shikimate kinase polypeptide whoch carries the catalytic site has been purified to homogeneity by a five-step procedure. The skikimate kinase was determined to have a molecular weight of 10,000 by superfine Sephadex G-75 thin layer chromatography and by calculation of the minimum chemical molecular weight from its amino acid composition. This number corresponds closely to the molecular weight determined by the mobility of the protein following electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The enzyme aggregates with itself forming larger molecular weight proteins. Thes aggregational pattersn depend on protein concentration and sulfhydryl bridges. The enzyme activity is completely inhibited by EDTA and the requirement for Mg2+ can be partially replaced by Mn2+, Ca2+, and Co2+. The inhibition of shikimate kinase activity by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate is reversed completely when the enzyme complex is treated with dithiothreitol, suggesting the sulfhydryl groups may be involved with the active site. The trifunctional complex is relatively unstable, and the nonidentical subunits dissociate readily. This dissociation results in a 99% loss in shikimate kinase activity and a 30% decrease in the chorismate mutase-DAHP synthetase activities. Shikimate kinase activity is subject to a variety of controls. It is inhibited by the allosteric effectors chorismate and prephenate, the products of the reaction, ADP, and shikimate 5-phosphate. The activity responds to changes in the energy charge of the cell. Because of the variety of controls exerted on this enzyme, this member of the regulatory complex may represent the key enzyme in the allosteric control of the synthesis of the common precursors of aromatic acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1498231624,"Abstract The dicarboxylate radical -OOC--CH--CH(OH)COO- was generated in an N2O-saturated fumarate solution by high energy ionizing radiation. When NADH was present in the solution, product analysis indicated a stoichiometry of 2 molecules of the radical reacted with 1 NADH molecule to form 2 malate and 1 enzymatically active NAD+ molecules. In a similar experiment using tritium label on position A of NADH, due to an isotope effect, only 10% of the label was transferred to malate; most of the remaining tritium was found in the NAD+ formed. When lactate dehydrogenase was added, however, no la bel was detectable in NAD+, and over 80% of the tritium lost from NADH was found in malate. The stereospecific transfer of the hydrogen atom from lactate dehydrogenase-bound NADH to the dicarboxylate radical suggested that the free radical reaction must have taken place at the active site. The hydrogen atom transfer was inhibited by oxamate. Results from flow experiments in which an irradiated fumarate solution was mixed with a solutionof lactate dehydrogenase and NADH are in support of a mechanism in which the hydrogen atom transfer occurs in the first oxidation step."
https://openalex.org/W2128876647,"Multipotential mouse teratocarcinoma cells in embryoid bodies were explanted on plastic or collagen substrates. Various modes of cell determination, including myogenesis, occurred. The predominant avenue of differentiation soon became myogenesis: many multinucleated myotubes formed and yielded an extensive network of skeletal muscle fibers. The process does not proceed to normal completion, as the fibers have a paucity of striations and are not contractile. Activities of several enzymes ordinarily associated with muscle differentiation were examined. Acetylcholinesterase activity increases, especially during myotube formation, as in normal myogenesis. However, creatine kinase activity rises during myotube formation and then drops abnormally, and myokinase activity fails to increase appreciably. The fetal isozymic form of creatine kinase is expressed in the cultures, although well differentiated solid tumors taken from mice show attainment of the adult muscle isozyme type if skeletal muscle is demonstrably present. The results are consistent with the interpretation that coordinately regulated changes in gene expressions controlling these functions may be required for later stages of myogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1561966086,"(21R)-[21-3H]cortisol and (21S)-[21-3H]cortisol were synthesized by reduction of 21-dehydrocortisol by NADH in the presence of 21-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The stereochemistry at carbon 21 was established after cleaving the side chain and oxidizing the resulting two epimers of tritiated glycolate with glycolate oxidase of known (2-pro-S) stereospecificity. From the distribution of radioactivity in the water and glyoxylate produced in this reaction, it was concluded that the reaction of 21-dehydrocortisol with (4S)-[4-3H]NADH catalyzed by 21-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase results in a transfer of tritium from the 4S position of the nucleotide to form (21S)-[21-3H]cortisol, and that (21R)-[21-3H]cortisol resulted from the enzyme-catalyzed reduction of 21-dehydro[21-3H]cortisol with NADH. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies on both epimers at position 21 of [21-2H]cortisol and of [21-2H]cortisone prepared enzymically identify the transferring 21-pro-S hydrogen as the relatively downfield of the two 21-hydrogen atoms."
https://openalex.org/W1550644873,"Acute intermittent porphyria is a gentic disease associated with changes in the activity of some of the hepatic enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway and in the activity of delta4-5alpha-steroid reductase, an enzyme involved in steroid metabolism. Embryonic chick liver has been used as a model system to study the effects of several naturally occurring 5beta steroid metabolites on delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme pathway (Granick, S., and Kappas, A. (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 4587-4593). In this study we have identified in vitro a hepatic cytoplasmic receptor which binds [3H]-etiocholanolone (a 5beta-H androgen metabolite). The steroid-receptor complex has an apparent Kd value of 3.5 times 10(-6) M at 0-4degrees; the number of binding sites per cell is 23,000. The macromolecular complex sediments at approximately 4 S in a 5 to 20% sucrose gradient and is unaffected by KCl concentrations up to 0.4 M. The steroid-receptor complex can be destroyed by heat (60degrees) or proteolytic digestion and is inhibited by sulfhydryl-blocking agents. Competition studies revealed that among the nonradioactive steroids tested, all of the primary androgens and the progestins as well as their 5alpha and 5beta metabolites block the binding of [3H]etiochalanolone. Only the glucuronide derivative of etiocholanolone, glucocorticoids and their metabolites, 17beta-estradiol, and cyproterone compete poorly for the receptor. The steroid receptor described here appears to be different from the androgen receptor isolated from rat liver and prostate."
https://openalex.org/W1556934470,"The effects of lysolecithin and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide on the structure and stability of apoA-II from human high density lipoprotein have been evalued by circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements. There is a profound enhancement in the stability of apoA-II to guanidinium hydrochloride denaturation when it forms a phospholipid complex with lysolecithin micelles. This complex is not only resistant to guanidinium hydrochloride denaturation, but it can be formed in a 6 M solution of this denaturant. The behavior of apoA-II in the native human high density protein is much closer to that of the lysolecithin apoA-II complex than to that of the free apoA-II."
