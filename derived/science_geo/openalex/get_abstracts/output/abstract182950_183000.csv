However, many biologically relevant processes occur at micromolar ligand concentrations, necessitating a reduction in the conventional observation volume by three orders of magnitude. We show that arrays of zero-mode waveguides consisting of subwavelength holes in a metal film provide a simple and highly parallel means for studying single-molecule dynamics at micromolar concentrations with microsecond temporal resolution. We present observations of DNA polymerase activity as an example of the effectiveness of zero-mode waveguides for performing single-molecule experiments at high concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W2135414906,"The structure of Escherichia coli succinate dehydrogenase (SQR), analogous to the mitochondrial respiratory complex II, has been determined, revealing the electron transport pathway from the electron donor, succinate, to the terminal electron acceptor, ubiquinone. It was found that the SQR redox centers are arranged in a manner that aids the prevention of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation at the flavin adenine dinucleotide. This is likely to be the main reason SQR is expressed during aerobic respiration rather than the related enzyme fumarate reductase, which produces high levels of ROS. Furthermore, symptoms of genetic disorders associated with mitochondrial SQR mutations may be a result of ROS formation resulting from impaired electron transport in the enzyme."

Cold sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the eastern tropical Pacific and warm SSTs in the western tropical Pacific and Indian oceans were remarkably persistent during this period. Climate models show that the climate signals forced separately by these regions acted synergistically, each contributing to widespread mid-latitude drying: an ideal scenario for spatially expansive, synchronized drought. The warmth of the Indian and west Pacific oceans was unprecedented and consistent with greenhouse gas forcing. Some implications are drawn for future drought."
https://openalex.org/W2080999576,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of several pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in insulin resistance during infection, cachexia, and obesity. We recently demonstrated that IL-6 inhibits insulin signaling in hepatocytes (Senn, J. J., Klover, P. J., Nowak, I. A., and Mooney, R. A. (2002) Diabetes51, 3391–3399). Members of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family associate with the insulin receptor (IR), and their ectopic expression inhibits IR signaling. Since several SOCS proteins are induced by IL-6, a working hypothesis is that IL-6-dependent insulin resistance is mediated, at least in part, by induction of SOCS protein(s) in insulin target cells. To examine the involvement of SOCS protein(s) in IL-6-dependent inhibition of insulin receptor signaling, HepG2 cells were treated with IL-6 (20 ng/ml) for periods from 1 min to 8 h. IL-6 induced SOCS-3 transcript at 30 min with a maximum effect at 1 h. SOCS-3 protein levels were also markedly elevated at 1 h. Transcript and protein levels returned to near basal levels by 2 h. SOCS-3 induction by IL-6 paralleled IL-6-dependent inhibition of IR signal transduction. Ectopically expressed SOCS-3 associated with the IR and suppressed insulin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation, association of IRS-1 with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and activation of Akt. SOCS-3 was also a direct inhibitor of insulin receptor autophosphorylation in vitro. In mice exposed to IL-6 for 60–90 min, hepatic SOCS-3 expression was increased. This was associated with inhibition of hepatic insulin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. These data suggest that induction of SOCS-3 in liver may be an important mechanism of IL-6-mediated insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance is a critical component in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Several cellular lesions have been associated with insulin resistance, including decreased insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity and decreased phosphorylation of target proteins such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) 1The abbreviations used are: IRS-1insulin receptor substrate-1IRinsulin receptorILinterleukinTNFtumor necrosis factorSOCSsuppressor of cytokine signaling-3STATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionJAKJanus kinase (1Virkamaki A.

Elevated levels of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1, and TNFα and hormones such as growth hormone and insulin have been linked to insulin resistance (3Kern P.A. Ranganathan S. Li C. Wood L.

The mechanisms for these effects, however, have not been clearly defined. One proposed mechanism, which is currently being actively investigated, is the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its subsequent direct inhibitory effect on insulin receptor kinase activity (7Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. van Obberghen E. Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F.

An alternate hypothesis is that cytokines and hormones induce the expression of cellular proteins that inhibit IR signal transduction. Our laboratory and others have proposed that the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of regulatory proteins may indeed fulfill this role (10Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C.

Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J.

There are currently eight members of this family (CIS and SOCS1-7) that share a similar three domain structure. These proteins are defined by an N-terminal variable length region followed by a central Src homology domain 2 (SH2) and a highly conserved C-terminal domain of 40–50 amino acids termed the SOCS box (16Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J. Cell Science. 2000; 113: 2813-2819PubMed Google Scholar). Because SOCS proteins inhibit cytokine-induced signaling pathways and because the expression of some SOCS genes is induced by the corresponding cytokines, SOCS proteins are believed to play a role in the negative feedback control of cytokine signaling. SOCS proteins appear to employ several mechanisms to inhibit cytokine signaling (17Yasukawa H. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). SOCS-1 inhibits several cytokine receptor signaling pathways by binding directly to and inhibiting the associated Janus kinases (JAKs) (14Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H.

Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In contrast, SOCS-3 binds more weakly to JAK kinases and inhibits several cytokine receptor signaling pathways by binding to phosphotyrosine residues on these receptors. This association allows it to interact with and inhibit the receptor-bound JAKs (21Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35553-35561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 22Nicholson S.E. De Souza D. Fabri L.J. Corbin J. Willson T.A. Zhang J.G. Silva A. Asimakis M.

The JAK inhibitory activity of SOCS-1 has been mapped to a motif it shares with SOCS-3 in the N-terminal regions of these proteins, which is distinct from the phosphotyrosine binding determinants (18Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 19Narazaki M.

Additionally, it has been shown that the SOCS proteins can inhibit signaling by targeting their binding partners for proteosomal degradation (24Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Recent reports describe the interaction of several of the SOCS family members with both the IR and the insulin-like growth factor receptorsin vivo, in vitro, and in the yeast two-hybrid system (10Emanuelli B.

Commun. 2000; 278: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Since SOCS proteins are induced by cytokines and hormones associated with insulin resistance, the SOCS proteins are excellent candidates for mediating cytokine-induced insulin resistance. Our laboratory has reported that SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 can associate with the insulin receptor in HepG2 cells and inhibit insulin receptor signal transduction (11Mooney R.A. Senn J. Cameron S. Inamdar N.

These SOCS proteins can also inhibit in vitro receptor kinase activity (11Mooney R.A. Senn J. Cameron S. Inamdar N. Boivin L.M. Shang Y. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol.

They propose that an association of SOCS-3 with Tyr-960 of the insulin receptor antagonizes STAT5 activation based on yeast two-hybrid studies. While this group could not demonstrate association between SOCS-3 and the insulin receptor in vivo, they report an inhibition of insulin-mediated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and p85 association by SOCS-3 in COS cells overexpressing IRS-1 and SOCS-3 (30Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Chavey C. Freidinger K. Hilton D.J. Hotamisligil G.S. van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47944-47949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar).

These results suggest that SOCS proteins may play a negative regulatory role in insulin signal transduction in response to obesity and other conditions promoting insulin resistance. IL-6 is the primary pro-inflammatory cytokine affecting the liver. This cytokine has also been shown to be elevated in the circulation of type 2 diabetics and to correlate most closely with insulin resistance (3Kern P.A. Ranganathan S. Li C. Wood L. Ranganathan G.

IL-6 has recently been shown by our laboratory to inhibit insulin signal transduction in hepatocytes and HepG2 cells (35Senn J.J. Klover P.J. Nowak I.A. Mooney R.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3391-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The IL-6-induced inhibition is apparent after 1 h of exposure to the cytokine. The current investigation posed the question of whether SOCS-3 could play a role in mediating the observed IL-6-dependent insulin resistance. The results indicate that IL-6 induces SOCS-3 in a temporal pattern that is consistent with its role in inhibiting insulin receptor signaling. Additional data demonstrate that SOCS-3 is a potent in vivo and in vitro inhibitor of insulin receptor signaling. Together these results provide evidence that SOCS-3 can be an important mediator of IL-6-dependent insulin resistance in hepatocytes. The isolation of the cDNA for human SOCS-3 has been described previously (29Dey B.R. Furlanetto R.W. Nissley P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The pBIG-2i expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. Craig Strathdee (The John P.

Jacobs (Wellcome Research Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, NC). The antibodies to phospho-Akt (Ser-473) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The anti-FLAG antibodies M2 and M5 were from Sigma. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), recombinant rat IRS-1, anti-IRS-1 antibody, and anti-p85 antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Anti-SOCS-3 antibody (M20) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The transfection reagent FuGENE 6 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Other reagents were obtained from commercial sources as indicated in the text and figure legends. HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells were grown to 75% confluence in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with the pBIG-2i-FLAG-SOCS-3 constructs or pBIG-2i-FLAG-null vector using FuGENE-6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. FLAG-tagged SOCS-3 was also transiently expressed in COS cells using the same expression plasmids and protocols. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the SOCS-3 construct as described above. After 6 h, the cells were placed in serum-free medium for 18 h. Cells were then treated with insulin at 10−7m for 1 min. After two washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer A containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4,140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm benzamidine, protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), 2.5 mm pervanadate, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Lysates were passed 10 times through an 18-gauge needle, centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, and then adjusted to contain equal amounts of protein as determined by the Bradford method (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Insulin receptors were immunoprecipitated using an anti-human insulin receptor antibody (α-IR-1) bound to protein G-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed four times with wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) and separated by SDS-PAGE, and associated FLAG-tagged SOCS-3 was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. HepG2 cells transiently expressing SOCS-3 were harvested after treatment with insulin for 5 min as described above. To analyze the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with α-IR-1, and autophosphorylation was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. To examine the effects of SOCS proteins on the insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and p85 association, cell lysates obtained from insulin-treated (5 min) HepG2 cells transiently expressing SOCS-3 were immunoprecipitated using anti-IRS-1 (α-IRS-1) antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 or anti-p85 antibody. Lysates from the same HepG2 cells were also examined by Western blot analysis for the presence of activated Akt kinase using anti-phosphoserine 473 Akt antibody. FLAG-tagged SOCS-3 was harvested from transiently transfected COS cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. COS cells were used for the isolation rather than HepG2 cells because the former express few insulin receptors, thus avoiding the possiblein vivo complexing of SOCS proteins with endogenous insulin receptors. Insulin receptors were isolated from HepG2 cells using wheat germ agglutinin-agarose affinity chromatography. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml bacitracin, 25 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a column containing 1 ml of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated agarose beads. After 30 min at 4 °C, the column was drained dry and washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and the IR was eluted with buffer containing 300 mmN-acetylglucosamine, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Insulin (10−7m) and ATP (10 μm) were added to aliquots of the wheat germ agglutinin-purified receptors and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The receptor preparations were then added to the SOCS protein immunoprecipitates and incubated for an additional 30 min. Finally, 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP was added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped with Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) sample buffer, and the constituents were separated by SDS-PAGE. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel was treated with 1n NaOH for 60 min at 55 °C, fixed, and dried. Analysis was by autoradiography. Male C57BL/6 mice (6–8-month-old) were injected with 1 μg/kg IL-6 or vehicle by subcutaneous administration. After 30, 60, and 90 min, livers were rapidly harvested. To examine the hepatic response to insulin, additional mice were anesthetized in a halothane chamber 90 min after IL-6 injections. The portal vein was exposed, 30 ng of insulin or vehicle were injected, and after 60 s the livers were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue extracts were prepared in ice-cold 2× homogenization buffer containing no detergent. Three 10-s cycles of a Polytron homogenizer were used, chilling homogenates between each cycle. The final 1× homogenization buffer contained 100 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem). Extracts were kept on ice for 30 min prior to a 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was then collected, protein content determined by the Bradford method (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar), and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. All procedures involving laboratory animals were approved by the University of Rochester Committee on Animal Resources. Total RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells and mouse livers described above using the guanidium thiocyanate phenol/chloroform method. mRNA was purified from the total RNA preparation using poly(A) Quik mRNA isolation kit (Stratagene). RNA electrophoresis was then performed using 10 μg of RNA or 1 μg of mRNA per lane on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde and then transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT membrane (Bio-Rad). RNA integrity was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining of the gel. An [α-P32]dCTP-labeled probe was created with the Random Primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen) using the 650-bp human SOCS-3 cDNA as a template. The probe was then purified by ethanol precipitation. Hybridization was performed using the Express-Hyb solution (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The relative intensity of SOCS-3 message was determined using a PhosphorImager (Storm 840, Molecular Dynamics) and autoradiography. Densitometry of autorads determined by using the ChemImager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test in the Stataquest statistical software package. The ability of IL-6 to induce expression of SOCS mRNA in HepG2 cells was examined at several time points during an 8-h incubation with the cytokine. Total cellular RNA was isolated, and the presence of SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and SOCS-6 mRNA were examined by Northern blot analysis. Only SOCS-3 expression was elevated in response to IL-6. SOCS-3 mRNA levels increased after 15 min of IL-6 treatment and were maximal by 1 h followed by a nadir at 2 h and then a small 2–3-fold increase at 4 h (Fig.1A). Following an identical time course of IL-6 treatment, SOCS-3 protein expression was detectable following 1 h of IL-6 treatment and then declined rapidly. No induction of SOCS-1, SOCS-2, or SOCS-6 was observed under these conditions (data not shown). These results indicate that IL-6 is capable of specifically inducing SOCS-3 mRNA and protein in HepG2 cells. Importantly, this induction closely correlates with our observations that IL-6 can inhibit insulin receptor signal transduction in hepatocytes and HepG2 cells after 1 h of pretreatment (35Senn J.J. Klover P.J. Nowak I.A. Mooney R.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3391-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that SOCS-1 and 6 can be co-immunoprecipitated with the insulin receptor, and this association is markedly enhanced by insulin (11Mooney R.A. Senn J. Cameron S. Inamdar N. Boivin L.M. Shang Y. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25889-25893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It has been suggested by yeast two-hybrid and co-localization experiments that SOCS-3 may also interact with the insulin receptor (10Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 29Dey B.R. Furlanetto R.W. Nissley P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine if SOCS-3 was capable of directly interacting with the insulin receptor, a FLAG epitope-tagged SOCS-3 was transiently expressed in HepG2 cells. Insulin receptor immunoprecipitates were examined by Western blot analysis for the presence of FLAG-tagged SOCS-3. As indicated in Fig.2, SOCS-3 associated with the insulin receptor in the presence or absence of insulin. This differs from experimental results with SOCS-1 and SOCS-6, which required insulin for maximum association. Additionally, this association was weak when compared with total SOCS-3 expression (Fig. 2, lower panel) and when compared with identical experiments performed with SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 (data not shown). While SOCS-3 can directly associate with the insulin receptor, suggesting that it may be involved in insulin signal transduction, the mechanism of interaction appears to differ from that of SOCS-1 and SOCS-6. Since SOCS-3 can directly interact with the IR when ectopically expressed, the following experiments examined whether SOCS-3 was capable of altering insulin signal transduction. We have recently shown that ectopic expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 proteins can inhibit insulin signal transduction without effecting IR autophosphorylation (11Mooney R.A. Senn J. Cameron S. Inamdar N. Boivin L.M. Shang Y. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25889-25893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ectopic expression of SOCS-3 was found to inhibit insulin receptor autophosphorylation in response to 100 nm insulin by ∼40–50% (Fig.3). Ectopic expression of SOCS-3 appeared to elevate basal autophosphorylation; however, this increase was not statistically significant. SOCS-3 expression did not affect the total cellular mass of the insulin receptors in HepG2 cells. These data provide further evidence that the interaction of SOCS-3 with the insulin receptor differs from that of SOCS-1 and SOCS-6. SOCS-3 expression also inhibited insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by a similar 40–50% (Fig.4A). This SOCS-dependent inhibition was produced without affecting IRS-1 protein levels. As expected, insulin-induced p85 association"

The subsequent nitriding kinetics of the treated iron with the nanostructured surface layer were greatly enhanced, so that the nitriding temperature could be as low as 300 degrees C, which is much lower than conventional nitriding temperatures (above 500 degrees C). This enhanced processing method demonstrates the technological significance of nanomaterials in improving traditional processing techniques and provides a new approach for selective surface reactions in solids."

However, teleportation of quantum states (the ultimate structure of objects) is possible1: only the structure is teleported—the matter stays at the source side and must be already present at the final location. Several table-top experiments have used qubits2,3,4,5,6,7 (two-dimensional quantum systems) or continuous variables8,9,10 to demonstrate the principle over short distances. Here we report a long-distance experimental demonstration of probabilistic quantum teleportation. Qubits carried by photons of 1.3 µm wavelength are teleported onto photons of 1.55 µm wavelength from one laboratory to another, separated by 55 m but connected by 2 km of standard telecommunications fibre.

To investigate the mechanism of spontaneous cell polarization, we used an assay in yeast where expression of an activated form of Cdc42, a Rho-type guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) required for cell polarization, could generate cell polarity without any recourse to a preestablished physical cue. The polar distribution of Cdc42 in this assay required targeted secretion directed by the actin cytoskeleton. A mathematical simulation showed that a stable polarity axis could be generated through a positive feedback loop in which a stochastic increase in the local concentration of activated Cdc42 on the plasma membrane enhanced the probability of actin polymerization and increased the probability of further Cdc42 accumulation to that site."

Here, we investigate the mechanism of angiotensin II-induced endothelial NADPH oxidase activation. Angiotensin II (100 nmol/liter)-induced reactive oxygen species production (as measured by dichlorohydrofluorescein fluorescence or lucigenin chemiluminescence) was completely absent in coronary microvascular endothelial cells isolated from p47phoxknockout mice. Transfection of p47phoxcDNA into p47phox−/− cells restored the angiotensin II response, whereas transfection of antisense p47phox cDNA into wild-type cells depleted p47phox and inhibited the angiotensin II response. In unstimulated human microvascular endothelial cells, there was significant p47phox-p22phox complex formation but minimal detectable p47phoxphosphorylation. Angiotensin II induced rapid serine phosphorylation of p47phox (within 1 min, peaking at ∼15 min), a 1.9 ± 0.1-fold increase in p47phox-p22phox complex formation and a 1.6 ± 0.2-fold increase in NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production (p< 0.05). p47phox was redistributed to 舠nuclear舡 and membrane-enriched cell fractions.

A significant body of evidence supports a role for the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the signal transduction of AngII-dependent cellular responses via activation of redox-sensitive signaling cascades (2Ushio-Fukai M.

AngII activates NADPH oxidases in vascular smooth muscle (5Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Google Scholar, 6Schieffer B. Luchtefeld M. Braun S. Hilfiker A.

Furthermore, NADPH oxidase activation and increased ROS production are implicated in AngII-stimulated vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy (3Ushio-Fukai M. Griendling K.K. Becker P.L. Hilenski L.

Cifuentes M.E. Kiarash A. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 408-414Google Scholar). The mechanisms through which AngII activates NADPH oxidase are therefore of interest. To date, NADPH oxidase has been best characterized in neutrophils where it is integral to nonspecific host defense. The neutrophil oxidase comprises a membrane-bound cytochrome b558composed of a p22phox-gp91phoxheterodimer and several cytosolic subunits (p47phox, p40phox, p67phox, and Rac) (14Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Google Scholar). The enzyme is normally dormant but upon neutrophil stimulation, the cytosolic subunits translocate to the membrane and associate with cytochromeb558, resulting in rapid activation of the oxidase. Phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit p47phox plays a key role in this process. The kinetics of NADPH oxidase activation parallel the kinetics of p47phox phosphorylation (15Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19910-19915Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p47phox is thought to induce conformational changes that allow subsequent binding of phospho-p47phox to cytochromeb558 and the other cytosolic subunits (14Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Google Scholar, 15Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19910-19915Google Scholar, 16Huang J. Kleinberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19731-19737Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase in non-phagocytic cells such as EC and vascular smooth muscle exhibits significant differences from the neutrophil enzyme. In particular, in contrast to the neutrophil enzyme, the oxidase in non-phagocytic cells is constitutively active at a low level even in unstimulated cells, yet it can be further stimulated acutely by agonists such as AngII and cytokines (5Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Google Scholar). Recent studies (17Suh Y.-A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 40: 79-82Google Scholar, 18Lassegue B. Sorescu D. Szocs K. Yin Q. Akers M. Zhang Y. Grant S.L. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 888-894Google Scholar) have indicated the presence of a number of isoforms of gp91phox, termed Noxs (for NADPH oxidase), and it has been suggested that the substitution of gp91phox (also known as Nox2) by Nox1 or Nox4 may account for the different behavior of non-phagocytic enzymes. For example, it has been shown in rat aortic smooth muscle cells that the predominant Nox isoforms are Nox4 and Nox1 with very low to undetectable levels of gp91phox expressed (18Lassegue B. Sorescu D. Szocs K. Yin Q. Akers M. Zhang Y. Grant S.L. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 888-894Google Scholar). In EC, however, all the classic NADPH oxidase subunits, including gp91phox, are expressed (19Li J.-M. Shah A.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 52: 477-486Google Scholar, 20Li J.-M. Shah A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19952-19960Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that, in contrast to neutrophils, in unstimulated quiescent cultured EC a substantial proportion of the NADPH oxidase is present as already fully preassembled complexes in a predominantly perinuclear location associated with the intracellular cytoskeleton (20Li J.-M. Shah A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19952-19960Google Scholar). Thus, the 舠cytosolic舡 subunits p47phox, p40phox, p67phox, and Rac1 could be co-immunoprecipitated down with p22phox and gp91phox in unstimulated EC. The presence of these preassembled complexes is likely to account for the constitutive NADPH oxidase activity of unstimulated EC. However, if the oxidase is already preassembled in unstimulated EC, what is the precise nature of the mechanism(s) underlying the increase in oxidase activity following addition of agonists such as AngII? Recently, we reported that the stimulation of EC NADPH oxidase activity by TNFα or phorbol ester (PMA) required the presence of p47phox, although the mechanisms involved were not defined in that study (21Li J.-M. Mullen A.M. Yun S. Wientjes F. Brouns G.Y. Thrasher A.J. Shah A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 143-150Google Scholar). Likewise, in vascular smooth muscle cells, the p47phoxsubunit has been shown to be essential for ROS production in response to PMA, AngII, thrombin, and platelet-derived growth factor (22Lavigne M.C. Malech H.L. Holland S.M. Leto T.L. Circulation. 2001; 104: 79-84Google Scholar, 23Barry-Lane P.A. Patterson C. van der Merwe M. Hu Z. Holland S.M. Yeh E.T.H. Runge M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1513-1522Google Scholar), and compelling evidence has been provided for its involvement in atherosclerosis (23Barry-Lane P.A. Patterson C. van der Merwe M. Hu Z. Holland S.M. Yeh E.T.H. Runge M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1513-1522Google Scholar). Potential mechanisms that could underlie the increase in NADPH oxidase activity induced by AngII may include (a) an increase in the number of fully assembled oxidase complexes, (b) the translocation of p47phox to partially assembled complexes, and/or (c) the phosphorylation of p47phox(or other subunits) that are already part of the assembled oxidase complex in EC. In the present study, we have therefore investigated the mechanisms of AngII-induced EC NADPH oxidase activation, focusing on the role of p47phox, its phosphorylation, and its possible translocation and association with cytochromeb558. Our results provide an insight into the fundamental mechanisms of AngII-induced EC NADPH oxidase activation and ROS production. 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Goat polyclonal antibodies to p22phox and p47phox and the corresponding blocking peptides were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p47phox and p22phox were a kind gift from Dr. F. Wientjes (University College London, UK). The anti-phosphoserine-specific monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. All other reagents were from Sigma except where specified. p47phox null mice (p47phox−/−) on a 129 sv background were generated as described (24Tkalcevic J. Novelli M. Phylactides M. Iredale J.P.

All studies conformed with the Guidance on the Operation of Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, UK). Coronary microvascular EC (CMEC) were isolated from the hearts of 8–10-week-old p47phox−/− and matched wild-type mice exactly as described previously (25Li J.-M. Mullen A.M. Shah A.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1119-1131Google Scholar). Cultured CMEC were used at passage 2. Human microvascular EC (HMEC-1) (26Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Google Scholar) were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA). HL-60 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. They were differentiated to neutrophils by incubation with 1.37 Me2SO for seven days and stimulated with PMA (100 ng/ml) for 30 min to activate NADPH oxidase (21Li J.-M. Mullen A.M. Yun S. Wientjes F. Brouns G.Y. Thrasher A.J. Shah A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 143-150Google Scholar). A number of complementary methods and assays were used for the detection of ROS (either O2⨪ or H2O2). For visualization of ROS production, EC were cultured onto chamber slides, washed in Hanks' buffer, and then exposed to AngII (100 nmol/liter) or buffer alone for 10 min. Cells were incubated with 10 ॖmol/liter DCF in Hanks' buffer for 30 min at room temperature, and DCF fluorescence (which detects mainly H2O2) was then acquired as described (21Li J.-M. Mullen A.M. Yun S. Wientjes F. Brouns G.Y. Thrasher A.J. Shah A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 143-150Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity was quantified microscopically from at least three random fields (1024 × 1022 pixels; 269.7 × 269.2 ॖm) per slide (50 cells assessed per slide), three slides per experimental condition. In some experiments, ROS generation in DCF-loaded cells was also measured by flow cytometry on a FACScalibur instrument (BD PharMingen). For these studies, EC just reaching confluence were detached by trypsin and stimulated with AngII (100 nm). Cellular fluorescence was quantitated by the geometric means of data distributions (GMean). Specific NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production was assessed by lucigenin (5 ॖmol/liter) chemiluminescence as described previously (19Li J.-M. Shah A.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 52: 477-486Google Scholar, 21Li J.-M. Mullen A.M. Yun S. Wientjes F. Brouns G.Y. Thrasher A.J. Shah A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 143-150Google Scholar). We measured this both in living cells and in total EC homogenate. For the latter, cells stimulated with AngII (100 nmol/liter) or buffer in serum-free medium were scraped into ice-cold Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with MgCl2 0.8 mmol/liter and CaCl2 1.8 mmol/liter. Cells were disrupted by rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by sonication. O2⨪ production was measured in the presence of NADPH (100 ॖmol/liter) for 20 min and was expressed as mean arbitrary light units per min (19Li J.-M. Shah A.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 52: 477-486Google Scholar, 21Li J.-M. Mullen A.M. Yun S. Wientjes F. Brouns G.Y. Thrasher A.J. Shah A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 143-150Google Scholar). In experiments with an AT1 or AT2 receptor antagonist (losartan and PD123319, respectively), these were added 30 min prior to AngII. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously using protein samples (250 ॖg) diluted in Tris-HCl 0.05 mol/liter buffer (pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors (20Li J.-M. Shah A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19952-19960Google Scholar). p22phox or p47phox was immunoprecipitated down with affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibodies coupled to protein G-agarose beads. Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates was undertaken with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p47phox and p22phox or an anti-phosphoserine-specific monoclonal antibody. Protein isolated from differentiated, PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells was used as a positive control. Differential centrifugation was undertaken exactly as described previously (20Li J.-M. Shah A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19952-19960Google Scholar). The following fractions were separated: (a) nuclei-enriched (N fraction) pelleted at 1,475 × g; (b) primary mitochondria and other large organelles (C fraction) pelleted at 10,800 × g; (c) submitochrondrial particles, smaller organelles, and some microsomes (D fraction) pelleted at 29,000 × g; (d) microsomes, microperoxisomes, and membrane fractions (E fraction) pelleted at 100,000 × g; and (e) soluble cytoplasmic protein (S fraction). The 舠purity舡 of fractions was confirmed by marker enzyme activities as described previously (20Li J.-M. Shah A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19952-19960Google Scholar). Full-length neutrophil sense and antisense p47phox cDNAs were generated and CMEC were transfected as described previously (21Li J.-M. Mullen A.M. Yun S. Wientjes F. Brouns G.Y. Thrasher A.J. Shah A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 143-150Google Scholar). After 72 h of transfection, cells were examined by confocal microscopy for the expression of p47phox protein using a BioRad 1024 microscope. Optical sections were taken at 0.5-ॖm intervals, and images were captured and stored digitally for analysis. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of at least three different experiments for each condition. Six mice per group were used for each CMEC isolation, and at least three independent isolates were studied. Comparisons were made by one-way analysis of variance or unpaired Student's t test as appropriate.p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To investigate whether p47phox is necessary for AngII-stimulated increases in NADPH oxidase activity, wild-type and p47phox−/− CMEC were studied in parallel (Fig.1A). Using flow cytometry in DCF-loaded cell suspensions, basal ROS production was detected in unstimulated EC of both types. Unstimulated p47phox−/− CMEC had significantly higher DCF fluorescence than wild-type cells (GMean 207.6 ± 11.26versus 162.9 ± 13.44; p < 0.01). Wild-type EC incubated with AngII for 30 min showed a significant increase in fluorescence signal (GMean 241.1 ± 12.40versus 162.9 ± 13.44; p < 0.01). In marked contrast, AngII treatment induced no increase in fluorescence in p47phox−/− cells; on the contrary, DCF fluorescence was reduced after AngII treatment (GMean 168.8 ± 13.45 versus 207.6 ± 11.26; p < 0.01). Similar results were obtained in experiments on adherent CMEC cultured onto chamber slides and examined by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1,B and C). A small amount of DCF fluorescence was detected in a mainly perinuclear distribution in unstimulated EC from both groups, with a higher level in p47phox−/−cells. AngII significantly increased fluorescence (by ∼507) in wild-type EC. However, no increase was observed after AngII in p47phox−/− cells. The addition of the cell-permeable O2⨪ scavenger, Tiron, abolished DCF fluorescence in both groups, indicating that the primary source of H2O2 detected by DCF was likely to be O2⨪ . As an alternative approach, NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production with and without AngII was examined by lucigenin chemiluminescence both in living cells and cell homogenates (Fig.2). Unstimulated p47phox−/− cells had slightly but significantly higher NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production than wild-type cells. AngII significantly increased NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production in intact wild-type cells (by 38.5 ± 9.87), whereas this response was completely blocked in p47phox−/− cells. NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production was fully inhibited by DPI (50 ॖmol/liter) in both groups (Fig. 2) but was unaltered by rotenone, oxypurinol, or L-NAME (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with cell homogenate (Fig. 2,middle panel). Again basal O2⨪ production was higher in p47phox−/− cells compared with wild-type. AngII caused an ∼2-fold increase in basal O2⨪ production in wild-type cells, whereas no increase was observed in p47phox−/− cells. AngII-induced NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production by wild-type cell homogenate was inhibited by DPI, superoxide dismutase, or Tiron, but was unaffected by rotenone, oxypurinol, or L-NAME (Fig. 2,middle and lower panels), consistent with NADPH oxidase as the source. Collectively, these results suggest that the p47phox subunit is essential for the AngII-induced increase in NADPH oxidase activity in EC. To confirm that the loss of ROS response to AngII stimulation was directly attributable to the absence of p47phox, we undertook experiments to acutely deplete or restore p47phox levels in EC by transfection of antisense or sense p47phox cDNA, respectively. Fig. 3A shows a representative example of the effect of antisense p47phox cDNA transfection on p47phox expression in wild-type CMEC, assessed by confocal microscopy. There was an ∼60.4 ± 7.37 reduction in p47phox fluorescence (mean data from 300 cells from three independent transfections). In wild-type EC transfected with vector control, AngII significantly increased NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production; this effect was totally lost in antisense cDNA transfected cells (Fig.3B, top panel). On the other hand, transfection of p47phox−/−cells with sense p47phox cDNA resulted in significant expression of p47phox (Fig.3A, lower panel). In parallel experiments, NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production in response to AngII was restored after sense p47phox cDNA transfection (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). These experiments clearly indicate an essential role of p47phox in AngII-induced EC NADPH oxidase activation and ROS production. To examine the mechanism through which p47phox is involved in AngII-induced NADPH oxidase activation, we studied p47phox phosphorylation and the binding of p47phox to p22phox. These studies were undertaken in HMEC-1, which were available in greater numbers than the primary murine EC isolates. Adherent cells were stimulated with AngII for 1–60 min, p47phox was immunoprecipitated from cell homogenate, and serine phosphorylation of p47phox was detected with a phosphoserine-specific antibody. In unstimulated cells, no significant serine phosphorylation of p47phox was detected (Fig. 4A, upper panel). AngII induced rapid p47phoxphosphorylation within 1 min, peaking at ∼15 min and thereafter declining gradually. The same membrane was reprobed with an anti-p22phox polyclonal antibody to assess the relationship between p47phox phosphorylation and p47phox-p22phox complex formation (Fig. 4A, lower panel). p22phox protein was readily detectable even in the p47phox immunoprecipitate of unstimulated EC, indicating complex formation in these cells in the absence of significant p47phox phosphorylation. However, the amount of p22phox co-immunoprecipitated with p47phox rapidly increased in AngII-stimulated EC, peaking at ∼15 min. Fig. 4B shows the mean data from three different experiments and also shows data for NADPH oxidase activity measured in parallel in EC homogenates. It is evident that AngII-induced increases in p47phox phosphorylation and p22phox-p47phox complex formation were paralleled by significant increases in oxidase activity. Because both AT1 and AT2 receptors are expressed on EC and could mediate different biological actions (8Lang D. Mosfer S.I. Shakesby A. Donaldson F. Lewis M.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 463-469Google Scholar, 9Zhang H. Schmeisser A. Garlichs C.D. Plotze K. Damme U. Mugge A. Daniel W.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 44: 215-222Google Scholar, 27Matsubara H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1182-1191Google Scholar), we examined their role in AngII-induced p47phox phosphorylation. HMEC-1 were preincubated for 30 min with either the AT1 antagonist losartan (1 ॖmol/liter) or the AT2 antagonist PD123319 (0.1 ॖmol/liter) before treatment with AngII. p47phox was immunoprecipitated and examined for serine phosphorylation (Fig.5A, upper panel). Both losartan or PD123319 inhibited AngII-induced p47phox phosphorylation, although the AT1 antagonist was more effective (Fig. 5B, upper panel). To examine complex formation, we immunoprecipitated p22phox and then probed for the co-existence of p47phox (Fig. 5A, lower panel). After 30 min of AngII treatment, the amount of p47phox co-immunoprecipitated with p22phox had increased significantly (p < 0.05; Fig. 5B, top panel). Interestingly, p47phox was detected as a doublet (Fig. 5A, lower panel); the additional band may represent phospho-p47phox because it was not detected in unstimulated EC and was decreased in cells preincubated with losartan or PD123319. Both losartan and PD123319 significantly inhibited AngII-induced p47phox-p22phox complex formation, with losartan again being more effective (Fig.5B, middle panel). This was accompanied by inhibition of AngII-induced NADPH oxidase activity, which occurred to a greater extent with losartan than with PD123319 (Fig. 5B,lower panel). Finally, we examined the effect of AngII treatment on the subcellular distribution of p47phox in HMEC-1. In unstimulated cells, after fractionation by differential centrifugation, the majority of p47phox (44 ± 37) was detected in the 100,000 × g (microsomal and membrane) E fraction with a significant proportion (30 ± 47) also found in the 1457 × g (nuclei-enriched) N fraction (Fig. 6A, upper panel). After AngII stimulation, 59 ± 47 of p47phox was detected in the N fraction and was clearly detected as a doublet band (Fig. 6A, lower panel). In line with these results, NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production was significantly increased in the N fraction in AngII-stimulated EC. A significant increase was also found in the E fraction (Fig. 6B). To assess whether a change in p47phoxsubcellular distribution could also be detected by a complementary method, we undertook immunocytochemical staining and confocal microscopy in HMEC-1 with and without AngII stimulation (Fig.7). In unstimulated cells, p47phox had a mainly perinuclear and rather punctate distribution. After AngII stimulation, the perinuclear p47phox labeling appeared more organized in a reticular pattern, and there was also clear labeling of the cell surface membranes (Fig. 7, lower panels, white arrows), consistent with a redistribution of p47phox. AngII is well known to increase EC ROS production, and recent studies have implicated the stimulation of NADPH oxidase as an important component of this response (4Pueyo M.E. Gonzalez W. Nicoletti A. Savoie F. Arnal J.-F. Michel J.-B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 645-651Google Scholar, 5Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Google Scholar, 8Lang D.

Res. 1999; 44: 215-222Google Scholar). In neutrophils, the activation of NADPH oxidase involves the translocation and binding of cytosolic subunits (p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and rac) to cytochrome b558; the phosphorylation of p47phox is considered to be a key step in this process (14Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Google Scholar). In EC, however, we have recently shown that a significant proportion of the oxidase is present as fully preassembled intracellular complexes, even in unstimulated (舠resting舡) cells (20Li J.-M. Shah A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19952-19960Google Scholar). The main new findings of the present study are that (a) AngII-stimulated increases in EC NADPH oxidase activity and ROS production are absolutely dependent on the p47phox subunit; (b) the phosphorylation of p47phox and its binding to the cytochrome b558 to form new complexes is required for the AngII response; and (c) in unstimulated cells, the p47phox that is bound to cytochromeb558 appears to be in an unphosphorylated or minimally phosphorylated state. The requirement for p47phox in the AngII response was clearly demonstrated in experiments on EC isolated from p47phox−/− and wild-type mice. Furthermore,in vitro transfection of p47phoxcDNA into p47phox−/− EC successfully restored the ROS response to AngII, whereas in vitrodepletion of p47phox from wild-type EC by antisense cDNA transfection resulted in loss of the ROS response. In the present study, we used lucigenin chemiluminescence or DCF fluorescence for ROS detection either in adherent cells, cell suspensions, and/or cell homogenates. Lucigenin chemiluminescence detects both intracellular and extracellular O2⨪ production, whereas DCF fluorescence detects mainly intracellular H2O2 (28Munzel T. Afanas'ev I.B. Kleschyov A.L. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1761-1768Google Scholar). Evidence that the primary species leading to the H2O2 detected by DCF fluorescence in this study was O2⨪ was provided by the finding that the cell-permeable O2⨪ scavenger Tiron substantially inhibited the DCF signal (Fig. 1C). The data from these different assays (i.e. Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) were broadly comparable in indicating a requirement for p47phox in the AngII response; the small quantitative differences between assays are likely to reflect the differing experimental conditions (i.e. adherent versus trypsinized cells and intact cells versus cell homogenate). The oxidase subunit p47phox contains several serine residues clustered within the carboxyl terminus that form potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (29Volpp B.D. Nauseef W.M. Donelson J.E. Moser D.R. Clark R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7195-7199Google Scholar). Native p47phox is a highly basic protein that undergoes stepwise charge shifts with successive phosphorylation events (29Volpp B.D. Nauseef W.M. Donelson J.E. Moser D.R. Clark R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7195-7199Google Scholar, 30Morozov I. Lotan O. Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 15435-15444Google Scholar). In neutrophils, p47phox phosphorylation is thought to be a prerequisite for its interaction with p22phox and the formation of a functional oxidase complex (15Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19910-19915Google Scholar, 16Huang J. Kleinberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19731-19737Google Scholar). In EC, however, a significant proportion of the NADPH oxidase is present as fully preassembled intracellular complexes even in unstimulated (舠resting舡) cells (20Li J.-M. Shah A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19952-19960Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the oxidase can be further stimulated by agonists such as AngII. In the present study, we confirmed that p47phox could be co-immunoprecipitated with p22phox in the absence of AngII stimulation. An interesting and new finding was that the p47phoxassociated with p22phox in unstimulated EC appeared to be largely unphosphorylated (or minimally phosphorylated). Although it is unclear how unphosphorylated p47phox may bind to p22phox in EC, it has previously been reported that unphosphorylated p47phox can bind to p22phox in in vitro assays in the presence of arachidonic acid but that this binding only supports low O2⨪ production (31Shiose A. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13793-13801Google Scholar). The binding of unphosphorylated rather than phosphorylated p47phox to cytochromeb558 may therefore account for the fact that oxidase activity in unstimulated EC is relatively low despite the presence of fully assembled complexes. The mechanism of further increases in oxidase activity in a setting where there are already existing preassembled complexes could either involve the phosphorylation of already bound p47phox or the formation of additional (new) complexes through the association of p47phoxwith other oxidase components. In neutrophils, initial p47phox phosphorylation is thought to occur in the cytosol; additional p47phox phosphorylation occurs upon interaction with membrane components, which then leads to immediate and irreversible binding of p47phox to cytochrome b558 (15Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19910-19915Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that AngII very rapidly induced p47phoxphosphorylation (<1 min), which was accompanied by an increase in p47phox-p22phox complex formation and O2⨪ production. These data are consistent with a mechanism where p47phox phosphorylation promotes stable binding of p47phox to p22phox (and thus oxidase activation), perhaps by inducing appropriate conformational changes in p47phox (16Huang J. Kleinberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19731-19737Google Scholar, 31Shiose A. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13793-13801Google Scholar), i.e. that p47phox phosphorylation promotes the formation of new oxidase complexes. Consistent with this, we found that AngII stimulation was associated with an ∼207 translocation of p47phox from other fractions to the N (nuclei-enriched) fraction, where we have previously shown that the majority of oxidase components are found in EC (20Li J.-M. Shah A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19952-19960Google Scholar). Interestingly, AngII also induced a small but significant translocation of p47phox to the membrane-enriched E fraction, consistent with some of the oxidase being present also on the plasma membrane. Indeed, immunocytochemical staining and confocal microscopy demonstrated p47phox labeling of the plasma membrane in AngII-treated cells as well as a suggestion of a more organized reticular labeling in the perinuclear region. The temporal relationship between p47phox phosphorylation, binding of phospho-p47phox to p22phox, and the increase in NADPH oxidase activity suggests that, as in neutrophils (14Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Google Scholar, 15Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19910-19915Google Scholar, 16Huang J. Kleinberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19731-19737Google Scholar), the serine phosphorylation of p47phox is the key step for oxidase activation by AngII. AngII exerts its biological effects through the activation of two distinct classes of receptors, AT1 and AT2. Both AT1 and AT2 receptors are known to be expressed in endothelial cells (9Zhang H. Schmeisser A. Garlichs C.D. Plotze K. Damme U. Mugge A. Daniel W.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 44: 215-222Google Scholar, 27Matsubara H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1182-1191Google Scholar, 32Pueyo M.E. Michel J.-B. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 29: 691-696Google Scholar). Most of the stimulatory effects of AngII on cardiovascular cells are mediated by AT1 receptors, whereas there is less data on the AT2 receptor subtype, which in some settings can be antagonistic. The results of the present study suggested that both AT1 and AT2 receptors were involved in AngII-induced p47phox phosphorylation and NADPH oxidase activation because the latter could be inhibited either by losartan or PD123319, which are known to be specific inhibitors of the AT1 and AT2 receptor, respectively. However, the effects of losartan appeared to be more potent than those of PD123319, in accordance with a previous study in EC (9Zhang H. Schmeisser A. Garlichs C.D. Plotze K. Damme U. Mugge A. Daniel W.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 44: 215-222Google Scholar). An interesting finding in the present study was that unstimulated p47phox−/− cells maintained a significant level of NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production and, in fact, had slightly but significantly higher ROS production than wild-type cells, as we have reported previously (21Li J.-M. Mullen A.M. Yun S. Wientjes F. Brouns G.Y. Thrasher A.J. Shah A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 143-150Google Scholar). The underlying basis for this 舠background舡 ROS production remains to be established. One interpretation of these results would be that the p47phox subunit is not essential for 舠basal舡 NADPH oxidase activity in EC. Consistent with this possibility, it has been reported that in cell-free systems NADPH oxidase can be activated in the absence of p47phox if high concentrations of p67phox and Rac1 are present (33Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Google Scholar, 34Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30326-30329Google Scholar). However, an alternative interpretation would be that the background ROS production emanates from a completely different source. The findings of the present and previous (21Li J.-M. Mullen A.M. Yun S. Wientjes F. Brouns G.Y. Thrasher A.J. Shah A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 143-150Google Scholar) studies that the background NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production is abolished by DPI but is unaffected by rotenone, oxypurinol, or L-NAME indicates that any such source would have to be an NADPH-dependent flavoprotein enzyme. Because DPI is not a specific inhibitor just of NADPH oxidase, definitive analysis of the underlying source of this background ROS production in EC may require studies in which multiple NADPH oxidase subunits are knocked out. In summary, this study demonstrates that AngII-induced ROS production by EC is critically dependent on the NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox. Serine phosphorylation of p47phox, followed by p47phox translocation and the stable binding of phospho-p47phox to p22phox are the key steps that initiate AngII-induced NADPH oxidase activation. This process appears to involve the formation of new oxidase complexes. ROS generated intracellularly in the perinuclear region may serve as signaling molecules for the activation of redox-sensitive enzymes and transcription factors (1Kim S. Iwao H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 11-34Google Scholar, 5Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Google Scholar), whereas extracellular ROS may contribute to endothelial dysfunction (11Rajagopalan S. Kurz S. Munzel T. Tarpey M. Freeman B.A. Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. J.

Aggeler R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 154-160Google Scholar, 2Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Google Scholar, 3Pedersen P.L. Ko Y.H. Hong S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 423-432Google Scholar). This remarkably complex process requires that four major events take place: electron transport, generation of a proton gradient, transport of Piand ADP, and finally coupling the proton gradient to ATP synthesis, a process catalyzed by the ATP synthase complex (F0F1).1The latter two events are closely synchronized as each ATP molecule that is made on the F1 unit of the ATP synthase inside the mitochondria exits this organelle as new Pi, and ADP molecules enter simultaneously on separate transporters, referred to here as PIC and ANC, respectively. As the ATP synthase has long been known to be associated with inner membrane regions or extensions called 舠cristae舡 (4Palade G. Anat. Rec. 1952; 114: 427-451Google Scholar, 5Kagawa Y. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2475-2482Google Scholar), it is here that PIC and ANC are also most likely localized.A major impediment to fully understanding the terminal events of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is the absence of atomic resolution structures for the complete ATP synthase, PIC, and ANC. In this regard, it seems likely that within the mitochondria, as for other complicated biological systems, supercomplexes exist. One or more may involve the electron transport chain complexes and another an ATP synthase-PIC-ANC complex. Significantly, biochemical evidence for respiratory chain supercomplexes in both mitochondria and bacteria has been obtained recently (6Schagger H. Biochim. Biophys.

Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Google Scholar, 11Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Google Scholar), it is not unrealistic to assume that similar achievements are likely to be forthcoming for other 舠supercomplexes舡 including those located in the mitochondrial inner membrane (6Schagger H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 154-159Google Scholar, 7Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Google Scholar). Here, however, the problem is compounded as the first barrier that must be overcome is not that of obtaining two- or three-dimensional crystals. Rather it is to identify an appropriate detergent that will maintain the complex or supercomplex of interest intact, active, and in soluble dispersed form (12Ostermeier C. Michel H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 697-701Google Scholar). This difficulty likely contributes substantially to the fact that of the 19,551 structures currently reported in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Biology data base, less than 30 are membrane proteins. Also, in examining several reports where remarkable success has been achieved (13Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Google Scholar, 14Xia D. Yu C.-A. Kim H.

Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Google Scholar), it is clear that no single detergent is appropriate for all membrane proteins. Rather, an exhaustive search must be conducted to identify the appropriate detergent(s) for each (12Ostermeier C. Michel H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 697-701Google Scholar).With the above thoughts in mind, the objectives of the work reported here were to obtain a highly enriched cristae-like vesicular fraction containing the ATP synthase in association with PIC and ANC and to identify detergents most appropriate for solubilizing this membrane associated supercomplex in an active dispersed form so that future structural studies could be conducted.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRats (Harlan Sprague-DawleyCD, white males) were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, reagents for electron microscopy from Pella, digitonin from Calbiochem, and Lubrol WX from Grand Island Biologicals. Other detergents were from Anatrace. Linbro 96-well microtiter plates for detergent screening were from ICN, and the multiwell plate reader was from Labsystems and Flow Laboratories. Oligomycin was from Sigma, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes from Millipore, Western blot reagents fromAmersham Biosciences, and Coomassie dye from Pierce. An antibody to ANC was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, whereas antibodies to the rat ATP synthase ॆ-subunit (Walker A region), δ-subunit, and PIC (residues 302–312) were from our own stocks.

The hyperChem version 7 program was obtained from Hypercube, Inc.MethodsATPase and Respiration AssaysATPase activity (±0.6 ॖg of oligomycin/mg of protein) and respiration (oxygen consumption) were monitored as described previously (17Catterall W.A.

Hullihen J. Hong S. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32931-32939Google Scholar).Cristae-like Inner Membrane VesiclesEach preparation commenced by preparing from four rats an inner mitochondrial membrane fraction (IMF) (18Chan T.L. Greenawalt J.W. Pedersen P.L. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 45: 291-305Google Scholar), after which a previously described procedure (21Soper J.W. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2682-2690Google Scholar) was modified to prepare the cristae-like membranes. Specifically, the IMF was suspended first in 16 ml of Buffer A (300 mmpotassium Pi, 4 mm ATP, 107 ethylene glycol, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9), frozen in dry ice and acetone, and stored overnight at −20 °C. The IMF was then slowly thawed, made up to 65 ml with Buffer B (300 mm potassium Pi, 50 mm EDTA, pH 7.9), and washed for 15 min by stirring in an ice-cold 100-ml beaker. Centrifugation was then carried out for 30 min in a Ti 70.1 rotor at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman LE 80K ultracentrifuge. The combined pellets in the multiple tubes were suspended in 65 ml of Buffer C (300 mm potassium Pi, 50 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.9) for 15 min and centrifuged again for 1 h at 50,000 rpm. The combined pellets were now suspended in 32 ml of Buffer C and centrifuged for 10 min at 6,000 rpm in a SS-24 rotor in a Sorvall RC-2B centrifuge. After saving the supernatants, the combined pellets were suspended in 16 ml of the same buffer and centrifuged as before in the Sorvall SS-24 rotor. The supernatants were saved again, and once more the pellets were suspended in 16 ml of the same buffer and centrifuged. Then pellets from the two previous steps were discarded, while the supernatants were combined and, after 15 min, subjected to centrifugation for 30 min at 50,000 rpm in the Beckman ultracentrifuge as described above. The pellets were suspended in 32 ml of Buffer C and centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 rpm in the SS-24 rotor in a Sorvall RC-2B centrifuge. After saving the supernatants, the tubes were tapped gently to dislodge the membrane pellets from underlying glycogen pellets. Then the membrane pellets were rinsed out of the tubes, suspended in 16 ml of Buffer C, and centrifuged in the SS-24 rotor as before. The supernatants were saved, suspended in 16 ml of Buffer C, and centrifuged as before at 10,000 rpm. The pellets were discarded, while the saved supernatants were pooled. Ethylene glycol was then added to the pooled supernatants to give a final concentration of 107, and after 30 min this fraction was diluted to 65 ml with Buffer A and centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 rpm in the Beckman ultracentrifuge. The supernatants were saved and the pellets discarded. The combined supernatants were then subjected to centrifugation for 45 min at 50,000 rpm in the same centrifuge. Now, the supernatants were discarded and the pellets suspended in 16 ml of Buffer A and centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 rpm. The resultant supernatants were centrifuged then for 1 h at 50,000 rpm. Finally, the supernatants were discarded and the pellets suspended in 32 ml of Buffer A and centrifuged again for 1 h at 50,000 rpm. The final pellets comprising the cristae-like inner membrane vesicles were suspended to 10 mg/ml in Buffer A, frozen in dry ice and acetone, and stored at −80 °C until use.Electron Microscopy, Transmission (TEM), and Scanning (SEM)For TEM the cristae-like membranes (20 ॖg/ml) were adsorbed onto glow-discharged, carbon-coated parlodion grids, rinsed in distilled water, negatively stained with 17 uranyl acetate + 0.047 tylose, dried, and then viewed and photographed using a Phillips CM 120 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. After scanning the negatives, tif images were created with a Zeiss Scanner (SCAI) utilizing Phodis software version 2.1 and then processed with Adobe Photoshop version 7.0. For SEM the same samples were adsorbed onto glow discharged silica chips (Pella 16008), fixed for 5 min at 25 °C in 17 glutaraldehyde + PBS, pH 7.4, rinsed twice with PBS and 0.1m sodium cacodylate, postfixed for 5 min in 27 osmium tetraoxide + 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, and after washing twice with distilled water, stained enbloc in 27 uranyl acetate. After complete dehydration using 1007 ethanol and a critical point dryer (Baltec CPD 30), samples were sputter-coated with 2-nm particles of chromium (Denton, DV 502A) under high vacuum and viewed with a LEO 1530 FIE scanning electron microscope operating at 1 kV. Tif images were stored and processed with Adobe Photoshop version 6.0.Multiwell Detergent Screening AssayThe screen was conducted using 96-well microtiter plates equipped with a multiwell plate reader. In each plate four different detergents at 12 different concentrations ranging from 0 to 2× CMC (in mm) were tested at 4 °C. For example, detergent 舠X舡 and ∼1 mg of cristae-like membranes in a total volume of 100 ॖl were placed in wells in row A at increasing concentrations of detergent. Row B was the same as row A except the cristae-like membranes were not included. After 12 h the absorbance in all wells was measured at 405 nm within 5 s in a multiwell plate reader. Absorbance readings in row A minus those in row B were used to determine the degree of solubility of the cristae-like membranes. Finally, a 1-ॖl aliquot was removed from each well in row A to assay for ATPase activity ± oligomycin.Sedimentation Analysis in SucroseThe membrane solution to be sedimented contained the following ingredients in a final volume of 5 ml: 10 mg cristae-like membranes, 0.57 detergent as indicated, 1 mm ATP, 25 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 57 ethylene glycol, and 50 mm Tricine, pH 7.9. This solution was layered onto a bed of 25 ml 257 sucrose containing the same components except the detergent concentration was 0.257. This solution was then subjected to centrifugation for 10 h at 25,000 rpm in a SW 28 rotor at 4 °C in the Beckman LE 80K ultracentrifuge. Aliquots were then removed from the top and subjected to ATPase assays, SDS-PAGE, and, where indicated, to Western blot analysis for PIC and ANC.Protein DeterminationsFor determining membrane protein the biuret procedure (22Jacobs E.E. Jacob M. Sanadi D.R. Bradley L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 147-156Google Scholar) was used. Other protein determinations were made using either the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) or the Coomassie dye binding procedure (Pierce). In all cases the standard was bovine albumin.DISCUSSIONOne of the greatest challenges in mitochondrial research remains that of obtaining detailed structural information about the terminal steps of oxidative phosphorylation, a complex process involving an ATP synthase to make ATP from Pi and ADP, and two transporters, PIC and ANC, to respectively allow the entrance of these two substrates and the exit of ATP. Studies reported here provide evidence that both the ATP synthase and its required transporters are localized in a cristae-like subfraction of the mitochondrial inner membrane where they form an ATP synthase-PIC-ANC complex. Other work involving an exhaustive screen of 80 different detergents has identified four that solubilize this complex intact and in dispersed form. Thus, these studies have satisfied several important requirements essential for future work that will focus on obtaining detailed structural information about this 舠supercomplex舡 or 舠ATP synthasome.舡As the complex that we have isolated in this study contains in addition to the ATP synthase, also PIC and ANC, the basepiece (membrane sector) is expected to be significantly larger than that characteristic of the ATP synthase alone. This appears to be the case as the basepiece of the bovine ATP synthase in a recent image reconstruction (26Karrasch S. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 379-384Google Scholar) has a width of only 84 Å, whereas single ATP synthasomes reported here have basepieces of greater than 100 Å. However, further analysis will be necessary taking into consideration detergent and lipid content. As yet, we do not know how 舠tight舡 the ATP synthase-PIC-ANC complex is and cannot exclude the possible presence of one or more other essential polypeptides.Finally, the importance of the work described here deserves comment. First, as it concerns the mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, these studies indicate that the substrates (Pi and ADP) for ATP synthesis are delivered directly to the ATP synthase and, following ATP synthesis, the product (ATP) is delivered directly to ANC for export to the cytoplasm. Second, as it concerns mitochondrial structure this work provides direct support for the emerging view (27Frey T.G. Mannella C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 319-324Google Scholar, 28Frey T.G. Renhen C.W. Perkins G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 196-203Google Scholar) that the cristae represent a distinct subcompartment of the inner membrane that harbors the terminal proteins of oxidative phosphorylation. Third, these studies provide a method for identifying an appropriate detergent to solubilize any membrane protein and in the case of the ATP synthase-PIC-ANC complex set the stage for structural studies of the complete terminal complex of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. As mitochondria comprise the site of most ATP production in animal cells by a process known as oxidative phosphorylation, there has been intense interest in understanding its mechanism (1Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 154-160Google Scholar, 2Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Google Scholar, 3Pedersen P.L. Ko Y.H. Hong S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 423-432Google Scholar). This remarkably complex process requires that four major events take place: electron transport, generation of a proton gradient, transport of Piand ADP, and finally coupling the proton gradient to ATP synthesis, a process catalyzed by the ATP synthase complex (F0F1).1The latter two events are closely synchronized as each ATP molecule that is made on the F1 unit of the ATP synthase inside the mitochondria exits this organelle as new Pi, and ADP molecules enter simultaneously on separate transporters, referred to here as PIC and ANC, respectively. As the ATP synthase has long been known to be associated with inner membrane regions or extensions called 舠cristae舡 (4Palade G. Anat. Rec. 1952; 114: 427-451Google Scholar, 5Kagawa Y. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2475-2482Google Scholar), it is here that PIC and ANC are also most likely localized. A major impediment to fully understanding the terminal events of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is the absence of atomic resolution structures for the complete ATP synthase, PIC, and ANC. In this regard, it seems likely that within the mitochondria, as for other complicated biological systems, supercomplexes exist. One or more may involve the electron transport chain complexes and another an ATP synthase-PIC-ANC complex. Significantly, biochemical evidence for respiratory chain supercomplexes in both mitochondria and bacteria has been obtained recently (6Schagger H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 154-159Google Scholar, 7Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Google Scholar), as has highly suggestive evidence for an association of the ATP synthase, PIC, and ANC (8Ziegler M. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25320-25328Google Scholar, 9Aggeler R. Coons J. Taylor S.W. Ghosh S.S. Garcia J.J. Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33906-33912Google Scholar).

Thus, defining the mechanisms of adenosine generation is critical for elucidating the role of this nucleoside in airway homeostasis. In this study, we identified the source of adenosine on the mucosal surface of human airway epithelia. Polarized primary cultures of human nasal or bronchial epithelial cells were assayed for transepithelial transport, cytosolic and cell surface adenosine production. Ussing chamber experiments indicated that serosal 1 μm [3H]adenosine was not transported to the mucosal compartment. Messenger RNA for the cytosolic AMP-specific 5′-nucleotidase (CN-I) was not detected in human bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting that mucosal adenosine did not originate from intracellular pools. In contrast, extracellular 0.1 mmATP was rapidly dephosphorylated into adenosine on the mucosal epithelial surface. We identified two ectonucleotidases that mediated the conversion of AMP to adenosine: ecto 5′-nucleotidase (ecto 5′-NT, CD73) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). Both mucosal and serosal epithelial surfaces displayed ecto 5′-NT activity (Km = 14 μm,Vmax = 0.5 nmol·min−1·cm−2), whereas AP activity was restricted to the mucosal surface (Km,high = 36 μm,Vmax = 1.2 nmol·min−1·cm−2;Km,low = 717 μm,Vmax = 2.8 nmol· min−1·cm−2). In bronchial cultures and tissues, ecto 5′-NT accounted for >80% of total activity toward 0.01 mm AMP, compared with <15% for 5 mm AMP. The proximal airway AP isoform was identified as nonspecific AP (NS AP) by levamisole sensitivity and mRNA expression. The two ectoenzymes presented opposite airway distributions, ecto 5′-NT and NS AP mRNA dominating in higher and lower airways, respectively. Collectively, these experiments support a major role for extracellular nucleotide catalysis and for ecto 5′-NT and NS AP in the regulation of adenosine concentrations on airway surfaces.

Collectively, these experiments support a major role for extracellular nucleotide catalysis and for ecto 5′-NT and NS AP in the regulation of adenosine concentrations on airway surfaces. mucociliary clearance β-met-ADP, α,β-methylene adenosine diphosphate alkaline phosphatase catalytic efficiency ecto 5′-nucleotidase (CD73) germ-cell alkaline phosphatase high-pressure liquid chromatography intestinal alkaline phosphatase Krebs buffer nonspecific alkaline phosphatase placental alkaline phosphatase RNase protection assay reverse transcriptase tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate cilia beating frequency interleukin N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid Mucociliary clearance (MCC)1 constitutes an essential component of airway defense against the development of infectious lung diseases (1Knowles M.R.

Two members of the P2X receptor subfamily were recently identified in human airway epithelial cultures: P2X4 and P2X5 (8Taylor A.L. Schwiebert L.M. Smith L.M. King C. Jones J.R. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These ATP-gated cationic channels increased Ca2+-dependent Cl− secretion (8Taylor A.L. Schwiebert L.M.

Interestingly, extracellular adenosine was found to be responsible for regulating the post-peak sustained phase of increased CBF induced by ATP on human nasal explants (4Morse D.M. Smullen J.L. Davis C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1485-C1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a human bronchial cell line lacking P2Y2 receptors (Calu-3; Ref. 10Communi D. Paindavoine P. Place G.

Adenosine could originate from the interstitial compartment and penetrate airway epithelial tight junctions to reach the lumen. The nucleoside could also be generated intracellularly by the cytosolic AMP-specific 5′-nucleotidase (CN-I) (16Hunsucker S.A. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol.

Alternatively, ATP release and cell surface conversion into adenosine has been reported in numerous mammalian cells (19Zimmermann H. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch.

All adenine nucleotides and nucleosides have been detected in the airway surface liquid under basal conditions (29Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Pediatr. Pulmonol. Suppl. 2001; 22: 239Google Scholar).

Boucher R.C. Drug Dev. Res. 2001; 23: 255-261Google Scholar). Two ectoenzymes have been reported to dephosphorylate AMP into adenosine on mammalian cells: ecto 5′-nucleotidase (ecto 5′-NT, CD73, eN; EC 3.1.3.5; Ref. 32Le Hir M. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F377-F387PubMed Google Scholar) and alkaline phosphatases (APs, EC 3.1.3.1; Ref. 33Fortuna R. Anderson H.C. Carty R.P. Sajdera W. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1980; 30: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Whereas ecto 5′-NT specifically dephosphorylates nucleoside monophosphates (AMP → adenosine (32Le Hir M. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F377-F387PubMed Google Scholar)), APs will metabolize a spectrum of substrates, including 5′-nucleotides (ATP → ADP → AMP → adenosine), pyrophosphate, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (33Fortuna R. Anderson H.C. Carty R.P. Sajdera W. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1980; 30: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The AP family contains four ectoenzymes: intestinal AP (I AP), tissue nonspecific AP detected in several organs including liver, bone, and kidney (NS AP), placental AP (PLA AP), and germ-cell AP (G AP) reported in testis and malignant tumors (34Goldstein D.J. Rogers C. Harris H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1982; 125: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Van Hoof V.O. De Broe M.E. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1994; 31: 197-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Two AP isoforms have been localized in human airways: NS AP and PLA AP. NS AP activity was detected by histochemistry on the epithelial surface lining the entire respiratory system, except for Type I pneumocytes (36Nouwen E.J. Pollet D.E. Eerdekens M.W. Hendrix P.G. Briers T.W. De Broe M.E. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 866-876PubMed Google Scholar), which express PLA AP (37Nouwen E.J. Buyssens N. De Broe M.E. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 260: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Bronchoalveolar fluid AP activity has been used for decades to diagnose acute lung injury and chronic disorders like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (38Henderson R.F. Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 56: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Capelli A. Lusuardi M. Cerutti C.G. Donner C.F. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 155: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because bronchoalveolar fluid and lung tissue AP activities are classically assayed withp-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (38Henderson R.F. Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 56: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Capelli A. Lusuardi M. Cerutti C.G. Donner C.F. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Acta. 1994; 1224: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the possible role of human airway AP in the production of extracellular adenosine has not been investigated. Furthermore, ecto 5′-NT activity has not been investigated in human airways. Thus, the pharmacological manipulation of endogenous adenosine levels by targeting these ectoenzymes remains an unexplored area.The purpose of this study was to identify the source(s) of extracellular adenosine on the mucosal surface of human airway epithelia, distinguishing between permeation from the interstitium, synthesis and secretion from the epithelial cells, and/or cell surface metabolism of released nucleotides. All experiments were performed on primary epithelial cultures, freshly excised airway epithelia or bronchial sections. Serosal to mucosal permeability was measured by Ussing chamber experiments with [3H]adenosine, and the transported species were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The expression of cytosolic CN-I was investigated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Based on our data suggesting that adenosine resulted from cell surface conversion of ATP → ADP → AMP → adenosine (31Picher M. Boucher R.C. Drug Dev. Res. 2001; 23: 255-261Google Scholar), we investigated in detail the biochemical properties and relative contribution of ecto 5′-NT and APs. Enzyme expression and tissue distribution were determined by RNase protection assays (RPA). Because of the potential importance of adenosine in diseases associated with airway inflammation (41Polosa R. Rorke S. Holgate S.T. Thorax. 2002; 57: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we investigated the impact of a prototypic inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), on ecto 5′-NT and APs expression.DISCUSSIONThe current understanding of airway defense mechanisms against bacterial infection acknowledges a complex interplay between ATP and adenosine receptor-mediated epithelial functions (2–15). However, despite numerous studies demonstrating that ATP is released from the mucosal surface of human airway epithelia (20Taylor A.L. Kudlow B.A. Marrs K.L. Gruenert D.C. Guggino W.B.

Chem. 2001; 279: 6621-6630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the origin of extracellular adenosine has not been established. In the present work, we considered three possible sources of adenosine for the mucosal surface: 1) paracellular or transepithelial transport from the interstitium; 2) cytosolic formation and release from epithelial cells facing the lumen; and 3) cell surface metabolism of locally released ATP. First, Ussing chamber experiments demonstrated that serosal [3H]adenosine did not permeate into the mucosal compartment, but was locally converted into [3H]inosine and [3H]hypoxanthine (Fig. 1, A and B). This observation was confirmed by applying ATP to the serosal compartment and searching by HPLC for the appearance of purine nucleotides/nucleosides on the mucosal surface (Fig. 1D). Second, we provided evidence that adenosine was not generated intracellularly for transport to the mucosal surface. Specifically, we sought evidence for the mRNA encoding the cytosolic enzyme for adenosine production, CN-I (16Hunsucker S.A. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10498-10504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17789-17793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and no evidence for expression of this transcript was found by RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). Moreover, we recently reported that extracellular adenosine was actively removed from the mucosal surface of human nasal epithelial cultures by a concentrative Na+-dependent nucleoside transporter (58Hirsh A.J. Picher M. Boucher R.C. Pediatr. Pulmonol. Suppl. 2001; 22: 241Google Scholar). These properties are consistent with the vectorial transport system described for adenosine across intestinal epithelia (59Chandrasena G. Giltay R. Patil S.D. Bakken A. Unadkat J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1909-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 60Patil S.D. Unadkat J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1314-G1320PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that interstitial and cytosolic pools of nucleosides do not contribute to the endogenous adenosine concentrations detected on the mucosal surface of human airway epithelia (29Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Pediatr. Pulmonol. Suppl. 2001; 22: 239Google Scholar).The abundant literature describing basal and stimulated ATP release from the mucosal surface of airway epithelia (20Taylor A.L.

Chem. 2001; 279: 6621-6630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (165) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that released ATP could represent the major source of adenosine through cell surface metabolism. Indeed, cell surface conversion of extracellular ATP into adenosine has been reported in most mammalian tissues (19Zimmermann H. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that ATP is sequentially dephosphorylated into ADP, AMP, and adenosine on airway epithelial surfaces. The physiological importance of constitutive ATP release and conversion to adenosine was emphasized by the substantial inhibitory effect (>70%) of 0.3 mmα,β-met-ADP on the basal cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator activity of Calu-3 cells (11Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This compound has been described as a competitive inhibitor of ecto 5′-NT and AP, preventing cell surface conversion of AMP to adenosine (32Le Hir M. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F377-F387PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine were confined to the epithelial surface on which ATP was administered suggested that mucosal and serosal surfaces represent distinct compartments with respect to nucleotide pools and purine-mediated signaling pathways. Patch clamp studies on Calu-3 cells demonstrated the close proximity between the site of ATP release, the enzymes responsible for adenosine production, A2Breceptors, G proteins, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (11Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings support local ATP release and metabolism as the major source of adenosine for P1 receptor activation on the mucosal surface of human airway epithelia.The present work identifies the ectoenzymes directly responsible for the production of adenosine from AMP on the mucosal surface of human airway epithelia. The conversion of extracellular AMP into adenosine was detected on nasal and bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting widespread expression throughout human airways. Several ectoenzymes have been reported to dephosphorylate AMP in the ectodomain: ecto 5′-NT and APs. The biochemical properties of AMP hydrolysis on primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells supported the functional expression of more than one ectoenzyme. Mucosal surfaces hydrolyzed nucleoside monophosphates with a substrate specificity (AMP ≥ UMP = CMP > GMP ≥ IMP) intermediate between that of purified ecto 5′-NT (AMP = UMP > CMP > GMP > IMP (48Sunderman F.W. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1990; 20: 123-139PubMed Google Scholar)) and purified AP (AMP = UMP = CMP = GMP = IMP (33Fortuna R. Anderson H.C. Carty R.P. Sajdera W. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1980; 30: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). Mammalian ecto 5′-NT and AP have been reported to display different cation and pH sensitivities. Purified ecto 5′-NT from rat glioblastoma was insensitive to Ca2+ and Mg2+(47Turnay J. Olmo N. Navarro J.M. Gavilanes J.G. Lizarbe M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 117: 23-33Google Scholar). In contrast, human liver AP (61Sugiura M. Hirano K. Iino S. Suzuki H. Oda T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1975; 23: 2369-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and kidney AP (62Sugiura M. Hirano K. Iino S. Suzuki H. Oda T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1976; 24: 1698-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) activities were enhanced 2–3-fold by Mg2+, suggesting that an AP could be responsible for the Mg2+-sensitive AMPase activity we detected on the mucosal surface of human bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 3B). In the presence of Mg2+, the optimum pH of purified ecto 5′-NT and AP were reported in the range 7.5–8.0 (47Turnay J. Olmo N. Navarro J.M. Gavilanes J.G. Lizarbe M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 117: 23-33Google Scholar, 63Le Hir M. Gandhi R. Dubach U.C. Enzyme. 1989; 41: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and 9–10 (33Fortuna R. Anderson H.C. Carty R.P. Sajdera W.

Bull. 1976; 24: 1698-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), respectively. We showed that assays conducted in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+generated two peaks of activity (pH 7.5 and 9.0) on the mucosal surface and a single peak (pH 7.5) on the serosal surface (Fig. 3C). Bimodal pH dependence profiles (pH 8.0 and 10.0) were also reported for AMPase activities measured on intact cells or plasma membrane preparations, the alkaline peak of activity exhibiting an absolute requirement for Mg2+ (64Evans W.H. Gurd J.W. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 65Song C.S. Bodansky O. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 694-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that ecto 5′-NT was responsible for the activity peak detected on both surfaces around pH 7.5, whereas the alkaline activity restricted to the mucosal surface corresponded to APs.The identity of the AMP-hydrolyzing enzymes expressed on human bronchial epithelial cells at pH 7.4 was further investigated with specific inhibitors. The activity of ecto 5′-NT was revealed with concanavalin A, a lectin reported to have no effect on APs (48Sunderman F.W. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1990; 20: 123-139PubMed Google Scholar). When reactions were initiated with 0.1 mm AMP, this compound inhibited 80 and 100% of total activity measured on mucosal and serosal surfaces, respectively. The remaining mucosal AMPase activity was completely inhibited by β-glycerophosphate and levamisole, non-competitive (49Belfield A. Golberg D.M. Nature. 1968; 219: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and competitive (50Van Belle H. Clin. Chem. 1976; 22: 972-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) inhibitors of APs, respectively. Conversely, serosal AMP hydrolysis was insensitive to levamisole. These results were in agreement with the polarity of ecto 5′-NT and AP activities suggested by the pH and cation sensitivity experiments.Levamisole has been used to discriminate between NS AP (IC50 = 30 μm), PLA AP (IC50 = 1.7 mm), and I AP (IC50 = 6.8 mm) (50Van Belle H. Clin. Chem. 1976; 22: 972-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The high sensitivity of the mucosal AMPase activity to levamisole (IC50 = 17 μm; Fig. 4B) suggests that NS AP would be the major AP isoform expressed on human airway epithelial cells. In addition, the reaction was resistant to 10 mml-phenylalanine (PLA and I AP inhibitor) and 10 mml-leucine (G AP inhibitor) (34Goldstein D.J. Rogers C. Harris H. Clin. Chim.

This identification of NS AP as the dominant AP isoform expressed in proximal airways was consistent with mRNA expression studies. Two AP isoforms were detected by RT-PCR in total RNA extracted from cultured or freshly excised human nasal, bronchial, and bronchiolar epithelial cells: NS AP and PLA AP (Fig. 7A). Whereas strong signals were obtained for NS AP in all RNA fractions, PLA AP mRNA was limited to bronchiolar epithelial cells. The localization of NS AP and PLA AP in human lungs has been investigated by histochemical and immunocytochemical procedures (36Nouwen E.J. Pollet D.E. Eerdekens M.W. Hendrix P.G. Briers T.W.

Although the trigger(s) and mechanism for tubular cell loss remain undefined, the hyperactive transforming growth factor (TGF)-ॆ1 signaling has long been suspected to play an active role. Here we demonstrate that although TGF-ॆ1 did not induce cell death per se, it dramatically potentiated renal tubular cell apoptosis initiated by other death cues in vitro. Pre-incubation of human kidney epithelial cells (HKC) with TGF-ॆ1 markedly promoted staurosporine-induced cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TGF-ॆ1 dramatically accelerated the cleavage and activation of pro-caspase-9, but not pro-caspase-8, in HKC cells. This event was followed by an accelerated activation of pro-caspase-3. To elucidate the mechanism underlying TGF-ॆ1 promotion of tubular cell death, we investigated the signaling pathways activated by TGF-ॆ1. Both Smad-2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase were rapidly activated by TGF-ॆ1, as demonstrated by the early induction of phosphorylated Smad-2 and p38 MAP kinase, respectively. We found that overexpression of inhibitory Smad-7 completely abolished Smad-2 phosphorylation and activation induced by TGF-ॆ1 but did not inhibit TGF-ॆ1-induced apoptosis. However, suppression of p38 MAP kinase with chemical inhibitor SC68376 not only abolished p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation but also obliterated apoptosis induced by TGF-ॆ1.

Nephrol. 1999; 13: 612-619Google Scholar). This pathologic process not only directly contributes to the progressive loss of renal function but also exacerbates the accumulation and deposition of extracellular matrix components leading to tissue fibrosis, probably because of the collapse and concentration of extracellular matrix surrounding the lost cells. In this regard, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis are often inter-dependent, mutually stimulating events that ultimately lead to end stage renal failure (4Eddy A.A. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2000; 15: 290-301Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of epithelial cell loss remains uncertain, it is conceivable to assume that tubular atrophy primarily results from apoptotic cell death under pathologic conditions (5Chevalier R.L.

However, the trigger(s) and underlying mechanism responsible for tubular cell apoptosis in vivo are largely unknown. Transforming growth factor-ॆ1 (TGF-ॆ1)1 is a pleiotropic protein that plays a central role in tissue fibrogenesis after injury (8Border W.A. Noble N.A.

Many lines of evidence implicate hyperactive TGF-ॆ1 as a major pathologic factor in the initiation and progression of chronic renal interstitial fibrosis. Overexpression of TGF-ॆ1 axis is found in virtually every type of chronic renal diseases in experimental animal models and in patients (12Sutaria P.M. Ohebshalom M. McCaffrey T.A. Vaughan Jr., E.D.

However, despite a causal relationship between hyperactive TGF-ॆ1 signaling and chronic renal fibrosis in which tubular atrophy is a characteristic feature, there is little direct, convincing evidence demonstrating that TGF-ॆ1 per se induces tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. Numerous studies indicate that TGF-ॆ1 is an important regulator of cell survival and apoptosis under diverse circumstances (21Patel P. Varghese E. Ding G. Fan S. Kapasi A. Reddy K. Franki N. Nahar N. Singhal P. J. Investig. Med. 2000; 48: 403-410Google Scholar, 22Herrera B. Fernandez M. Alvarez A.M. Roncero C. Benito M. Gil J. Fabregat I. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 548-556Google Scholar, 23Schiffer M. Bitzer M. Roberts I.S. Kopp J.B. ten Dijke P. Mundel P. Bottinger E.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 807-816Google Scholar). However, the fate of the cells after TGF-ॆ1 treatment is often determined by cellular context and experimental conditions. For instance, TGF-ॆ1 acts as death stimulus inducing apoptotic death in fetal hepatocytes, podocytes, and certain neuronal cells (22Herrera B. Fernandez M. Alvarez A.M. Roncero C. Benito M. Gil J. Fabregat I. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 548-556Google Scholar, 23Schiffer M. Bitzer M. Roberts I.S. Kopp J.B. ten Dijke P. Mundel P. Bottinger E.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 807-816Google Scholar), whereas it also elicits pro-survival activity to protect macrophages against apoptosis (24Chin B.Y. Petrache I. Choi A.M. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11362-11368Google Scholar, 25Schlapbach R. Spanaus K.S. Malipiero U. Lens S. Tasinato A. Tschopp J. Fontana A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3680-3688Google Scholar). As to renal tubular epithelial cells, preliminary studies in our laboratory failed to demonstrate that TGF-ॆ1 by itself significantly affects their survival in cultured conditions (data not shown). Such disparity between TGF-ॆ1 signaling and cell apoptosis implies that hyperactive TGF-ॆ1 signaling alone may not be sufficient for causing tubular epithelial cells to die. This observation led us to propose a 舠two-hit model舡 in which both TGF-ॆ1 signaling and a second death cue work in concert to lead to tubular epithelial cells undergoing apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrate that although TGF-ॆ1 by itself did not induce tubular epithelial cells to die, it markedly potentiated cell apoptosis initiated by other death cues by accelerating the activation of pro-caspase-9 and -3. This action of TGF-ॆ1 is likely mediated by a mechanism independent of Smad signaling. Our results suggest that TGF-ॆ1 promotes tubular epithelial cell death by increasing their susceptibility to secondary death stimuli. The antibodies for cleaved caspase-9, full-length and cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, phospho-specific p38 MAP kinase, phospho-specific ERK1/2, phospho-specific JNK, and total JNK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The antibody against phospho-specific Smad-2 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-Smad-7 (sc-7004), anti-Smad-2/3 (sc-6032), anti-full-length caspase-3 (sc-7148), total p38 MAP kinase (sc-535), and anti-actin (sc-1616) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody against total ERK1/2 was obtained from Sigma. Affinity-purified secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Recombinant human TGF-ॆ1 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). SC68376 (p38 MAP kinase inhibitor) and fluorescent dye H-33258 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cell culture medium, fetal bovine serum, and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen. The apoptosis detection system was purchased fromPromega (Madison, WI). Staurosporine and all other chemicals were of analytic grade and were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HKC) were kindly provided by Dr. L. Racusen of The Johns Hopkins University (26Racusen L.C. Monteil C. Sgrignoli A. Lucskay M. Marouillat S. Rhim J.G. Morin J.P. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1997; 129: 318-329Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F-12 medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum (27Liu Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F624-F633Google Scholar). HKC cells were seeded at ∼ 707 confluence in complete medium containing 107 fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four h later, the cells were changed to serum-free medium and incubated for 16 h. Cells were then treated with recombinant TGF-ॆ1 for various periods of time as indicated. Staurosporine was added to the cultures at the final concentration of 1 ॖm, followed by incubating for additional periods of time ranging from 1 to 24 h. The cells were then collected at different time points for apoptosis detection and caspases activation analysis. Nuclear chromatin morphology was examined by staining with the fluorescent dye H-33258 (5 ॖg/ml) as described previously (28Liu Y. Sun A.M. Dworkin L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 821-826Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent and detached cells were pooled, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 37 paraformaldehyde, and followed by staining with H-33258 for 10 min at 37 °C. Cell smears were prepared on glass slides, observed, and photographed on a Nikon Eclipse E600 Epi-fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera (Melville, NY). Apoptotic cells with characteristic nuclear condensation and fragmentation were counted in at least ten random fields and expressed as a percentage of the total cell number (apoptotic index). In situ detection of DNA fragmentation was performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. A fluorescein-based TUNEL staining protocol was employed by using an apoptosis detection system (29Dai C. Yang J. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 411-422Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 37 paraformaldehyde, and then treated with 0.27 Triton X-100 for 10 min. After pre-equilibration in 100 ॖl of buffer containing 200 mm potassium cacodylate, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 mm cobalt chloride, strands of DNA were end-labeled by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h in 50 ॖm fluorescein-12-dUTP, 100 ॖm dATP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× sodium chloride/sodium citrate hybridization buffer for 15 min. After washing, the slides were mounted and observed on a Nikon Eclipse E600 Epi-fluorescence microscope. DNA laddering was assessed essentially according to the procedure described previously (28Liu Y. Sun A.M. Dworkin L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 821-826Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent and detached cells were combined and lysed in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.27 Triton X-100 on ice for 20 min. After a spin at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatant (rich in low molecular weight DNA) was incubated with protease K (200 ॖg/ml) at 55 °C for 16 h and 20 ॖg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h and extracted with phenol-chloroform. The DNA was precipitated by ethanol and separated by electrophoresis on a 1.07 agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Detection of pro- and cleaved caspases was performed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. HKC cells following different treatments were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Chaps cell extract buffer containing 50 mmpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid), pH 6.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.17 Chaps, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 20 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 10 ॖg/ml pepstatin, 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After freezing and thawing three times, cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min; the supernatants were added with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 27 SDS, 107 glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.17 bromphenol blue). Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 ∼10 min before loading and separated on pre-casted 10 or 157 SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in transfer buffer containing 48 mmTris-HCl, 39 mm glycine, 0.0377 SDS, and 207 methanol at 4 °C for 1 h. Nonspecific binding to the membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 57 nonfat milk in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.17 Tween 20). The membranes were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with various primary antibodies in TBS buffer containing 57 milk at the dilutions specified by the manufacturers. The binding of primary antibodies was followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG in 17 nonfat milk. The signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL;Amersham Biosciences). HKC cells were transfected with the pSmad-7 expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. P. ten Dijke of Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) (30Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Google Scholar) using the LipofectAMINETM 2000 according to the instructions specified by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Twenty-four h after transfection and every 3–4 days thereafter, the cells were re-fed with fresh selective medium containing G418 (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 800 ॖg/ml. Neomycin-resistant clones were first visible after 7 days and continuously cultured in selective medium for about 14 days. The clones were then individually transferred into 6-well plates for expansion using a cloning cylinder (Sigma). After two further passages in selective medium, expanded independent clones were cultured in standard medium. As a mock-transfection control, the pcDNA3 empty vector was used to transfect HKC cells in a manner identical to the pSmad-7 plasmid. Overexpression of Smad-7 was confirmed in the stable cell line by Western blot analysis and by immunofluorescence staining. Immunostaining was performed according to the protocol described previously (31Yang J. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 96-107Google Scholar). All data examined were expressed as mean ± S.E. For Western blot analysis, quantitation was carried out by scanning and analyzing the intensity of the hybridization signals using the NIH Imagine program. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Comparison between groups was made using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student's-Newman-Kuels test. A pvalue of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Incubation of human kidney proximal tubular epithelial HKC cells with various concentrations of TGF-ॆ1 for 2 days did not significantly affect cell viability and apoptosis as evidenced by nuclear condensation and fragmentation, as well as caspases activation (data not shown), suggesting that exogenous TGF-ॆ1 per sedoes not induce tubular epithelial cells undergoing apoptotic cell death. However, pre-incubation of HKC cells with TGF-ॆ1 dramatically potentiated tubular epithelial cell apoptosis induced by a well known death stimulus, staurosporine. As shown in Fig.1, staurosporine induced tubular epithelial cell apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After treatment with 1 ॖm staurosporine for 24 h, about 207 of HKC cells underwent nuclear condensation and fragmentation as visualized by H-33258 staining (Fig. 1E). Pretreatment of HKC cells with 2 ng/ml of TGF-ॆ1 for 16 h drastically increased the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis to ∼407, as assessed by H-33258 staining (Fig. 1, D andF). TGF-ॆ1 potentiation of HKC cell apoptosis induced by staurosporine was apparently dependent on the duration of pre-incubation; simultaneous incubation of HKC cells with TGF-ॆ1 and staurosporine did not significantly increase cell death compared with staurosporine treatment alone (Fig. 1G). The ability of TGF-ॆ1 to enhance staurosporine-induced cell death was also dose-dependent and was effective at a concentration as low as 0.5 ng/ml (Fig. 1H). To further confirm TGF-ॆ1 potentiation of tubular epithelial cell death, we employed two additional approaches to detect cell apoptosis after various treatments of HKC cells, namely TUNEL staining and DNA laddering analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, TGF-ॆ1 pre-incubation for 16 h markedly enhanced HKC cell apoptosis induced by staurosporine. TUNEL staining revealed a more than 2-fold induction of apoptosis in the TGF-ॆ1-pretreated group as compared with that with staurosporine treatment alone (Fig. 2,A–D). Similarly, DNA laddering analysis also exhibited a greater DNA fragmentation observed in TGF-ॆ1-pretreated cells as compared with that in the cells treated with staurosporine alone (Fig. 2E, lanes 3 and 4). To elucidate how TGF-ॆ1 potentiates tubular epithelial cell death, we examined the activation of pro-caspases in HKC cells after incubation with staurosporine alone or following pretreatment with TGF-ॆ1. Fig. 3 shows the kinetics of pro-caspase-9 activation in HKC cells upon treatment with death stimulus. Staurosporine induced rapid, marked pro-caspase-9 cleavage to produce an active form in tubular epithelial cells in a time-dependent fashion. Of interest, pre-incubation with TGF-ॆ1 dramatically accelerated this activation process in HKC cells. At 1 h after staurosporine treatment, whereas pro-caspase-9 activation was barely detectable in HKC cells, the level of active caspase-9 in TGF-ॆ1-pretreated cells was markedly increased and reached about 20-fold of that in control HKC cells (Fig. 3,A and B). The active caspase-9 peaked at 3 h (about 60-fold) following addition of death stimulus in TGF-ॆ1-preteated cells, whereas it reached the highest level at 6 h in non-pretreated HKC cells. These results suggest that TGF-ॆ1 potentiates tubular epithelial cell apoptosis by accelerating pro-caspase-9 activation after death challenge. Staurosporine also induced pro-caspase-8 activation in tubular epithelial cells in a time-dependent manner. However, pre-incubation with TGF-ॆ1 did not change the kinetics of pro-caspase-8 cleavage and its subsequent activation. The pattern of pro-caspase-8 activation after treatment with death stimulus was essentially identical in the tubular epithelial cells pretreated with or without TGF-ॆ1 (Fig. 3, C and D). We further investigated the effect of TGF-ॆ1 on the activation of downstream effector pro-caspase in tubular epithelial cells after death challenge. As shown in Fig.4, pro-caspase-3 activation following staurosporine treatment in HKC cells was also significantly accelerated by TGF-ॆ1 pretreatment. At 3 h after addition of death stimulus, active caspase-3 level in TGF-ॆ1-pretreated HKC cells was more than 11-fold of that in untreated cells (Fig. 4, A andB). Significant acceleration on pro-caspase-3 activation by TGF-ॆ1 pretreatment was also found at other time points in HKC cells (Fig. 4). Dose dependence studies revealed that TGF-ॆ1, at a concentration of 0.5 ng/ml, was sufficient for enhancing pro-caspase-3 activation (Fig. 4, C and D). A higher dose of TGF-ॆ1 did not result in a further significant increase in the levels of active caspase-3 in HKC cells (Fig. 4). To decipher the signal pathway(s) responsible for TGF-ॆ1 potentiation of renal tubular cell apoptosis, we first investigated the potential signaling events initiated by TGF-ॆ1 in HKC cells. As shown in Fig. 5, incubation of HKC cells with TGF-ॆ1 induced rapid activation of Smad signaling. The phosphorylated state of Smad-2 increased as early as 10 min, peaked at 30 min, and gradually returned toward basal level at 3 h after TGF-ॆ1 stimulation (Fig. 5, A and C). As Smad-2 is an effector intermediate signaling molecule for TGF-ॆ1, its phosphorylation and activation manifest that the Smad signaling is probably one of the major signal transduction pathways that is readily activated and potentially mediates the cellular actions of TGF-ॆ1 in renal tubular epithelial cells. Besides Smad signaling, we also examined the effect of TGF-ॆ1 on other signal pathways in renal tubular epithelial cells. Fig.5B shows the activation of p38 MAP kinase upon TGF-ॆ1 stimulation in HKC cells. Treatment of HKC cells with TGF-ॆ1 induced p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation at 1 h, and this induction was largely sustained throughout the entire experimental scheme of 48 h (Fig. 5, B and C). Under the same conditions, TGF-ॆ1 did not significantly activate the ERK1/2 and JNK, the other two subfamilies of the MAP kinases (see Fig. 8). These results suggest that both Smad signaling and p38 MAP kinase are activated in renal tubular epithelial cells upon stimulation by TGF-ॆ1. To investigate the potential role of Smad signaling in mediating TGF-ॆ1 potentiation of renal tubular cell death, we studied the effects of blocking Smad signaling on cell apoptosis by overexpressing inhibitory Smad-7. To this end, stable cell lines were established after transfecting with either pSmad-7 expression plasmid or pcDNA3 empty vector. As shown in Fig. 6, HK-pSmad-7 cell line robustly expressed Smad-7, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A) and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, overexpression of Smad-7 completely abolished Smad-2 activation following TGF-ॆ1 incubation in the HK-pSmad-7 cells (Fig. 6C). There was no significant increase in the levels of phosphorylated Smad-2 in the HK-pSmad-7 cells after TGF-ॆ1 treatment, in contrast to the HK-pcDNA3 cells (Fig.6C), suggesting that inhibitory Smad-7 can effectively blunt TGF-ॆ1-initiated Smad signaling. Of note, overexpression of Smad-7 did not affect p38 MAP kinase activation induced by TGF-ॆ1 in renal epithelial cells (Fig. 6D). We examined and compared the effects of TGF-ॆ1 on staurosporine-induced apoptosis in HK-pSmad-7 and control HK-pcDNA3 cell lines. As shown in Fig. 7, no significant difference in apoptotic index was found between HK-pcDNA3 and HK-pSmad-7 cells. Likewise, it was virtually identical in the abundance of the cleaved, active caspase-3 in the HK-pcDNA3 and HK-pSmad-7 cells after incubation with staurosporine for various periods of time (Fig. 6, Cand D). Thus, overexpression of inhibitory Smad-7 in renal tubular cells abrogates Smad-2 activation but does not abolish TGF-ॆ1 potentiation of cell death, indicating that TGF-ॆ1 promotes cell apoptosis by a mechanism independent of Smad signaling. We also investigated the possible role of p38 MAP kinase in renal tubular cell apoptosis. Treatment of HKC cells with SC68376, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, abolished TGF-ॆ1-induced p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.8A). SC68376 at a concentration of 20 ॖm completely abrogated p38 MAP kinase activation but did not influence Smad-2 phosphorylation induced by TGF-ॆ1. Of note, both TGF-ॆ1 and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SC68376 failed to significantly affect the phosphorylation status of the ERK1/2 and JNK in renal epithelial HKC cells (Fig. 8, Cand D). We next examined the effects of blockade of p38 MAP kinase activation on cell death and caspase-3 activation. As shown in Fig.9, A and B, SC68376 markedly abolished TGF-ॆ1-induced caspase-3 activation in renal tubular epithelial cells but did not affect basal caspase-3 activation induced by staurosporine alone. Consistently, inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activation by SC68376 also obliterated TGF-ॆ1 potentiation of cell apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent fashion (Fig.9, C and D). These results indicate that TGF-ॆ1 promotes renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis by a p38 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Although TGF-ॆ1 has long been alleged to play a critical role in the tubular atrophy characterized by epithelial cell loss (3Chevalier R.L. Pediatr. Nephrol. 1999; 13: 612-619Google Scholar, 9Klahr S. Morrissey J.J. Kidney Int. 2000; 57 Suppl. 75: 7-14Google Scholar), there is little direct evidence demonstrating that TGF-ॆ1 actually causes tubular epithelial cells to die in vitro. Incubation of cultured tubular epithelial cells with TGF-ॆ1 at the concentration comparable with physiologic or pathophysiologic circumstances resulted in little or no appreciable cell death (see Figs. 1 and 2). This observation suggests that TGF-ॆ1 signaling is certainly not sufficient to trigger tubular epithelial cells to commit suicide. In this study, we have demonstrated that TGF-ॆ1 plays an imperative role in promoting tubular epithelial cell death, not by directly inducing cell apoptosis but rather by sensitizing these cells to a hit from secondary death cues. These findings are consistent with a two-hit model of tubular epithelial cell death, in which the primary role of hyperactive TGF-ॆ1 signaling perhaps is to render tubular cells readily susceptible to a second hit from other death stimuli. The necessity for two hits to induce tubular epithelial cell death may potentially have its biologic advantages, which could provide an effective means for preventing renal tubules from unwanted, accidental cell loss under normal physiologic conditions. It is reasonable to speculate that such two-hit scenario will retain double checkpoints to ensure the death/survival of tubular cells under tight control in vivo. Transient TGF-ॆ1 up-regulation without secondary hit may eventually leave tubular epithelial cells to survive. However, sustained activation of TGF-ॆ1 signaling followed by secondary death challenges, a situation that presumably occurs under chronically injured conditions (32Yang J. Liu Y. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1465-1475Google Scholar), could have lethal consequence to the tubular cells. Our two-hit working model is supported by the in vivoobservation that the expression of both TGF-ॆ1 and its type I receptor is specifically up-regulated in renal tubules of the obstructed kidneys (12Sutaria P.M. Ohebshalom M. McCaffrey T.A. Vaughan Jr., E.D. Felsen D. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1965-1972Google Scholar, 32Yang J. Liu Y. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1465-1475Google Scholar). Furthermore, this tubule-specific induction of TGF-ॆ1 axis is an early event that takes place at 1 day after ureteral obstruction (32Yang J. Liu Y. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1465-1475Google Scholar), a timing that precedes significant cell apoptosis in the kidneys. These spatial and temporal correlations between the activation of TGF-ॆ1 signaling and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis imply that hyperactive TGF-ॆ1 may play a critical role in promoting tubular cell death in the diseased kidneys, probably by priming these cells to commit suicide upon secondary death challenges. Although the exact death cues responsible for tubular epithelial cell apoptosis in the obstructed kidneys in vivo remain to be identified, there are a plenty of candidates that could serve as the 舠second hit舡 to trigger apoptotic program in the tubular cells that once were primed by hyperactive TGF-ॆ1 signaling. For example, in kidneys with persistent and complete ureteral obstruction, chronic hypoxia induced by a compromised interstitial blood flow could result in cellular ATP deprivation that might serve as an apoptosis trigger (33Lieberthal W. Menza S.A. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F315-F327Google Scholar, 34Lieberthal W. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F477-F488Google Scholar). Likewise, infiltration of inflammatory cells as seen in the obstructed kidneys may contribute to cell death by producing pro-death ligand or cytokines (35Ortiz A. Lorz C. Egido J. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1999; 14: 1831-1834Google Scholar, 36Lorz C. Ortiz A. Justo P. Gonzalez-Cuadrado S. Duque N. Gomez-Guerrero C. Egido J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1266-1277Google Scholar, 37Jones E.A. Shahed A. Shoskes D.A. Urology. 2000; 56: 346-351Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of normal cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions in the diseased kidneys provides a hostile environment for tubular cell survival that ultimately leads cells to die. In this context, the suppression of E-cadherin expression in the obstructed kidneys, as reported previously (31Yang J. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 96-107Google Scholar), may act as a secondary hit that results in tubular cell death. E-cadherin is an epithelial cell adhesion receptor found within adherens-type junctions. Although it is widely recognized that E-cadherin plays an essential role in the maintenance of structural integrity of renal tubular epithelia (38Horster M.F. Braun G.S. Huber S.M. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1157-1191Google Scholar), recent studies also implicate it as a major survival factor for tubular epithelial cells (39Bergin E. Levine J.S. Koh J.S. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: F758-F768Google Scholar). In addition, the progressive deposition of extracellular matrix as seen in the chronically diseased kidneys will eventually disrupt normal cell-matrix interactions of renal tubules (40Yang J. Dai C. Liu Y. Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 1470-1479Google Scholar, 41Eddy A.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 2495-2508Google Scholar, 42Yang J. Shultz R.W. Mars W.M. Wegner R.E. Li Y. Dai C. Nejak K. Liu Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1525-1538Google Scholar). Such disturbance of the microenvironment that surrounds the tubular cells could potentially function as a second hit for renal epithelial cell apoptosis. Collectively, there are a wide variety of factors present in the diseased kidneys that could conceivably work in concert with TGF-ॆ1 to lead tubular epithelial cells to commit to die in vivo. The finding that TGF-ॆ1 only accelerates the activation of pro-caspase-9, but not pro-caspase-8, suggests that its action is probably mediated via a pathway involving mitochondria (43Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Google Scholar, 44Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Google Scholar). Both caspase-9 and caspase-8 are recognized as initial caspases whose activation triggers a cascade of activation process of downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3 (45Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Google Scholar, 46Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Google Scholar). However, the upstream pathways leading to activation of caspase-9 and caspase-8 are believed to be different. Although caspase-8 activation is involved in death receptor pathway such as FasL and Fas, pro-caspase-9 cleavage and subsequent activation is coupled with the events associated with the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria and activation of Apaf-1 (47Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Google Scholar, 48Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Google Scholar, 49Barinaga M. Science. 1998; 280: 32-34Google Scholar). The specific acceleration of caspase-9 activation by TGF-ॆ1 suggests that its pro-apoptotic signaling is implicated in a pathway involved in mitochondria, although the details remain to be unraveled. Of note, TGF-ॆ1 apparently only accelerates pro-caspase-9 activation but not increases the magnitude of active caspase-9 peak level (Fig.3). For instance, TGF-ॆ1 pre-incubation followed by treatment with death stimulus produced the peak of active caspase-9 3 h earlier over the control cultures. This phenomenon could be attributable to the assumption that endogenous pro-caspase-9 may be fully activated upon stimulation with death challenges in tubular epithelial cells. The present study attempted to dissect the signaling pathways that lead to TGF-ॆ1 potentiation of renal tubular cell apoptosis. It has been well documented that TGF-ॆ1, through binding to its type II and type I receptors, elicits a wide range of cellular responses that modulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (10Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Google Scholar, 25Schlapbach R. Spanaus K.S. Malipiero U. Lens S. Tasinato A. Tschopp J. Fontana A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3680-3688Google Scholar, 50Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Google Scholar). Many of the signaling responses initiated by TGF-ॆ1 are primarily mediated by intermediate signaling molecules Smad proteins (51Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Google Scholar, 52Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Google Scholar, 53Bottinger E.P. Bitzer M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2600-2610Google Scholar). It appears clear that TGF-ॆ1 activates at least two separate intracellular signal transduction pathways that result in both Smad and p38 MAP kinase activation in renal tubular cells (Fig. 5). Of interest, despite early and marked activation of Smad-2, Smad signaling appears not to mediate TGF-ॆ1 promotion of cell death (see Figs. 5 and 7). This is in contrast to the TGF-ॆ1-induced apoptosis in podocytes, in which Smad-7 is demonstrated to play a critical role (23Schiffer M. Bitzer M. Roberts I.S. Kopp J.B. ten Dijke P. Mundel P. Bottinger E.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 807-816Google Scholar). Of note, Smad-7 is an inhibitory Smad that can functionally antagonize receptor-regulated-Smad (such as Smad-2 and -3) signaling by competitively binding to TGF-ॆ receptors (10Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Google Scholar). Although not determined yet, it is reasonable to speculate that overexpression of inhibitory Smad-7 may also block Smad-3 activation in renal epithelial cells, in view of the fact that Smad-2 and Smad-3 are highly homologous and often activated simultaneously by TGF-ॆ1 (51Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Google Scholar). Of interest, neither endogenous Smad-7 in renal tubular epithelial cells is induced by TGF-ॆ1 (data not shown), nor does overexpression of exogenous Smad-7 affect cell death/survival under basal conditions. Furthermore, although overexpression of Smad-7 abolished Smad-2 phosphorylation and activation in response to TGF-ॆ1 stimulation (Fig. 6), it failed to obliterate renal tubular cell apoptosis (Fig. 7). Therefore, unlike in podocytes, it appears obvious that TGF-ॆ1 promotes renal tubular cell apoptosis via a mechanism independent of Smad signaling. Our results provide a mechanistic link between TGF-ॆ1 promotion of cell apoptosis and p38 MAP kinase activation (see Figs. 8 and 9). The p38 MAP kinase belongs to a subfamily of the MAP kinases and is activated primarily in response to stress, as well as cytokine stimulation (54Schramek H. News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17: 62-67Google Scholar, 55Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Google Scholar). Earlier studies suggest that different subfamilies of MAP kinases play a distinct role in regulating cell apoptosis, with ERK-MAP kinase as pro-survival and p38 MAP kinase and JNK as pro-death signals (56Park H.J. Kim B.C. Kim S.J. Choi K.S. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1360-1371Google Scholar, 57di Mari J.F. Davis R. Safirstein R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F195-F203Google Scholar, 58Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Google Scholar). Thus, the ratio among different MAP kinases may dictate cell fate in certain conditions. In this regard, we found no significant alterations in ERK-MAP kinase and JNK, suggesting that the p38 MAP kinase activation likely plays a predominant role in mediating TGF-ॆ1-induced cell death. The requirement of p38 MAP kinase activation for mediating TGF-ॆ1-induced apoptosis is illustrated by abrogating cell death after blockade of its activation (Fig. 9). Of note, a sustained, but not transient, p38 MAP kinase activation may also be of importance in inducing cell apoptosis, because a long period of pre-incubation with TGF-ॆ1, which induces sustained p38 MAK kinase activation (Fig. 5B), is required for optimal potentiation of staurosporine-induced cell death (Fig.1G). Thus it is concluded that a p38 MAP kinase-dependent, Smad-independent signaling mediates TGF-ॆ1-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis. In summary, we have shown in this report that TGF-ॆ1 dramatically potentiates cell apoptosis triggered by other death cues by accelerating the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in tubular epithelial cells. Thus, hyperactive TGF-ॆ1 signaling promotes renal interstitial fibrogenesis not only by its well documented profibrotic actions but also by its potentiation of tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, our results unravel a novel mode of TGF-ॆ1 action in the regulation of cell death/survival, in which it primarily renders the tubular epithelial cells readily susceptible to secondary death cues rather than directly inducing them to die. This action of TGF-ॆ1 in promoting cell death appears to be mediated by a mechanism dependent of p38 MAP kinase but independent of Smad signaling. We thank Dr. P. ten Dijke for generously providing Smad-7 expression vector."

The spin filter consists of an open quantum dot in an in-plane magnetic field; the in-plane field gives the two spin directions different Fermi wavelengths resulting in spin-dependent quantum interference of transport through the device. The gate voltage is used to select the preferentially transmitted spin, thus setting the polarity of the filter. This provides a fully electrical method for the creation and detection of spin-polarized currents.

Although the simulated (virtual) times of the PEs progress at a nonzero rate, their standard deviation (spread) diverges with the number of PEs, hindering efficient data collection. We show that weak random interactions among the PEs can make this spread nondivergent. The PEs then progress at a nonzero, near-uniform rate without requiring global synchronizations."

This translocation results in the <i>EWS-Fli1</i> fusion gene, which has been shown to be a potent, single-step transforming gene. We reported previously that suppression of the EWS-Fli1 fusion protein altered the expression of G<sub>1</sub> regulatory cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors both at mRNA and protein levels, resulting in G<sub>1</sub> growth arrest in Ewing's family tumor cell lines. These data suggest that the G<sub>1</sub>regulatory molecules may be targets of the EWS-Fli1 fusion protein, which functions as an aberrant transcription factor. By using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we show here the direct association of EWS-Fli1 fusion protein with ETS consensus sequences, which are in the promoter of the p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> gene. Reporter gene assays revealed that the activity of the p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> promoter is negatively regulated by EWS-Fli1 fusion protein through at least two ETS-binding sites in the promoter. EWS-Fli1 interacted with p300 cotransactivator and suppressed its histone acetyltransferase activity, which may explain the down-regulation of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> by EWS-Fli1. In the presence of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, the histone acetyltransferase activity of the Ewing's family tumor cell was recovered resulting in the induction of p21, and the cell growth was dramatically inhibited.

The anaphase-promoting complex (APC)1 functions as a major ubiquitin ligase in the cell, and it governs anaphase onset, mitotic exit, and G1 events (1Page A.M. Hieter P. Annu. Rev.

It catalyzes the formation of polyubiquitin chains on cyclins and other cell cycle regulators and thereby targets them for degradation by proteosome. The components of APC are highly conserved in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. The rise and fall of APC activity is stringently regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. It plateaus at the transition from metaphase to anaphase, remains high throughout G1, and drops in S/G2until early mitosis (5Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Google Scholar). One important mechanism for the regulation of APC is through phosphorylation of its subunits (6Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9303-9307Google Scholar, 7Kotani S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Todokoro K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 791-800Google Scholar, 8Kramer E.R. Scheuringer N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Peters J.-M.

In addition, CDC20 and CDH1 can act as activators and specificity factors of APC (10Matsumoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 742-750Google Scholar, 11Schwab M. Lutum A.S. Seufert W.

Many substrate proteins targeted by the CDC20- and CDH1-activated APC share a sequence motif known as destruction box (5Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol.

Another motif termed the KEN box is recognized by CDH1-activated APC and has been found in substrates including CDC20, NEK2, HSL1, mitotic cyclins, and securin (17Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2274-2285Google Scholar). Exactly how CDC20 and CDH1 activate APC remains to be fully understood. Existing evidence suggests that they mediate the temporal and spatial activation of APC through direct interaction with different sets of substrate proteins (19Burton J.L. Solomon M.J.

The steady-state amounts of CDC20 and CDH1 transcripts peak in G2-M and fall dramatically at the entry into G1(5Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Google Scholar, 8Kramer E.R.

However, experiments conducted with a highly specific antibody against CDH1 have demonstrated the oscillation of CDH1 protein as cells enter and exit mitosis (8Kramer E.R. Scheuringer N.

Interestingly, a recent genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans has revealed a role for CDH1 in controlling cell proliferation (28Fay D.S. Keenan S. Han M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 503-517Google Scholar). In line with this, a significant reduction of CDH1 has been documented during the malignant progression of a B-lymphoma cell line (29Wang C.-X. Fisk B.C. Wadehra M. Su H. Braun J. Blood. 2000; 96: 259-263Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of CDC20 and CDH1 has been well documented (22Hilioti Z. Chung Y.-S. Mochizuki Y. Hardy C.F.J. Cohen-Fix O. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1347-1352Google Scholar,30Ohtoshi A. Maeda T. Higashi H. Ashizawa S. Hatakeyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 530-534Google Scholar), but it remains unclear as to whether and how phosphorylation of CDC20 may influence the APC activity (7Kotani S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Todokoro K. J.

In contrast, the phosphorylation of CDH1 is known to abolish its ability to activate APC (7Kotani S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Todokoro K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 791-800Google Scholar, 31Zachariae W.

CDH1 is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and dephosphorylated by CDC14 phosphatase (32Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 227-236Google Scholar, 33Lukas C.

In particular, mitotic checkpoint proteins MAD2 and BUBR1 interact with CDC20 and inhibit its APC-activating activity, thereby inducing a mitotic arrest (38Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W.

In addition, a separate arm of the mitotic checkpoint is defined by BUB2, which targets CDH1 to inhibit cytokinesis and DNA replication (45Alexandru G. Zachariae W. Schleiffer A. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2707-2721Google Scholar, 46Fesquet D. Fitzpatrick P.J. Johnson A.L. Kramer K.M. Toyn J.H. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2424-2434Google Scholar, 47Fraschini R. Formenti E.

Interestingly, an MAD2 isoform termed MAD2B or MAD2L2, which is paralogous to MAD2 but does not bind to MAD1, also associates with and inhibits CDH1 (49Chen J. Fang G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1765-1770Google Scholar, 50Pfleger C.M. Salic A. Lee E. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1759-1764Google Scholar). We have previously identified and characterized human mitotic checkpoint proteins MAD1 and MAD2 (51Jin D.-Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.-T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Google Scholar, 52Jin D.-Y. Kozak C.A. Pangilinan F. Spencer F. Jeang K.-T. Genomics. 1999; 55: 363-364Google Scholar, 53Krishnan R. Goodman B. Jin D.-Y. Jeang K.-T. Collins C. Stetten G. Spencer F. Genomics. 1998; 49: 475-478Google Scholar). Given that CDH1 is a downstream effector of the mitotic checkpoint, we set out to characterize human CDH1 in cultured cells. In this study, we demonstrate that human CDH1 localizes to the centrosome and the nucleus. Moreover, the nuclear import of CDH1 is regulated by phosphorylation in the vicinity of the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Our findings implicate a complex cell cycle-dependent regulation of human CDH1 activity in temporal and spatial dimensions. Polyclonal anti-CDH1 antibody α-CDH1N was raised in rabbits against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide, which corresponds to the amino-terminal 20 residues (amino acids 2–21) of human CDH1. Polyclonal anti-CDH1 antibody α-CDH1C was raised in rabbits against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 472–493 of human CDH1. α-CDH1N and α-CDH1C antibodies were purified through HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with the immunizing peptides. Mouse monoclonal anti-NuMA (NA08) was purchased from Oncogene Research Products. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (B-5-1-2) was from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA (F-7), rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (Y-11), rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin A (H-432), and rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin E (C-19) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human CDH1 cDNA with a complete coding region (GenBankTMAF083810) was assembled from expressed sequence tags obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Expression vector for human CDH1 (pHACDH1) was derived from a previously described plasmid pHA containing SV40 promoters and enhancers (54Jin D.-Y. Giordano V. Kibler K.V. Nakano H. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17402-17405Google Scholar). pHA was also used to express the three CDH1 mutants CDH1-4A, CDH-4D, and CDH1-AAA. In CDH1-4A and CDH1-4D, serines 40, 151, 163, and threonine 121 were substituted with alanines and aspartates, respectively through PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. CDH1-AAA was constructed by replacing the Arg-Val-Leu triplet (amino acids 445–447) with three alanines. Sequences of all cDNAs coding for CDH1 mutants were determined to verify that they have the desired substitutions and not any undesired changes. To express a chimeric green fluorescent protein (GFP) with the CDH1 nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the carboxyl terminus (GFPNLS), we PCR-amplified a 104-bp DNA fragment coding for amino acids 151–178 of human CDH1 and subcloned this fragment into plasmid pEGFP-C1 via restriction sites XhoI and BamHI (Clontech). The pEGFP-C1 vector was also used to express GFP fusion proteins GFPCDH1, GFPNLS-2A, and GFPNLS-2D. In GFPNLS-2A and GFPNLS-2D, serines 151 and 163 near the NLS of CDH1 had been replaced by alanines or aspartates, respectively. Details for PCR primers and for plasmid construction are available upon request. Extracts of HeLa cells were solubilized directly in SDS gel loading buffer (60 mm Tris base, 27 SDS, 107 glycerol, 57 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.17 bromphenol blue). Proteins were separated on 127 SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) using a semidry blotter (Hoefer). Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL,Amersham Biosciences). Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope as detailed elsewhere (51Jin D.-Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.-T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Google Scholar,55Jin D.-Y. Wang H.-L. Zhou Y. Chun A.C.S. Kibler K.V. Hou Y.-D. Kung H.-f. Jeang K.-T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 729-740Google Scholar). Dual immunofluorescent detection was achieved with primary antibodies from different species and pre-adsorbed species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to different fluorochromes: Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Zymax) and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Zymax). GFP experiments were carried out as previously described (56Ching Y.-P. Zhou H.-J. Yuan J.-G. Qiang B.-Q. Kung H.-F. Jin D.-Y. Genomics. 2002; 79: 2-6Google Scholar). The spatial regulation of APC activity is an integral part of cell cycle control. The APC components and substrates, including cyclins and CDKs, perform their specific functions at restricted subcellular locales (57Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E73-E79Google Scholar,58Huang J.-y. Raff J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2847-2856Google Scholar). To shed light on the spatial control of CDH1 activity, we investigated the subcellular localization of endogenous CDH1 protein. We raised two specific antisera against CDH1 (α-CDH1N and α-CDH1C) in rabbits and stained HeLa cells for CDH1 using affinity-purified antibodies. As a first step, we verified the specificity of the anti-CDH1 antibodies by immunoblotting. An example of this experiment is shown in Fig. 1A, in which HeLa cell extracts were immunoblotted with either α-CDH1N or α-CDH1N preincubated with excessive amount of immunizing peptide. A discrete protein band of 55 kDa reactive to α-CDH1N was observed (Fig. 1A, lane 1), and this band disappeared if the antibodies were pre-absorbed with the peptide (lane 2). Next HeLa cells were stained with either α-CDH1N or pre-absorbed α-CDH1N (Fig. 1B). The endogenous CDH1 in HeLa cells was predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 1B, panel 1), and the peptide blocking experiment corroborated the specificity of this staining pattern (panel 2). To assess the dynamics of CDH1 localization during the cell cycle, we co-stained CDH1 and the cell cycle marker α-tubulin (Fig.1C). During the interphase, the endogenous CDH1 in HeLa cells localized to the nucleus in a nucleoli-excluded pattern. During this time CDH1 and α-tubulin resided in distinct subcellular compartments with minimal co-localization (Fig. 1C,panels 1–3). Notably, as the cell entered metaphase, CDH1 concentrated into the centrosomes (Fig. 1C, panels 4–6). Thus a significant co-localization of CDH1 and α-tubulin was noted. CDH1 remained in the centrosomes as the cell committed into anaphase (Fig. 1C, panels 7–9). The subcellular localizations of human CDH1 are highly reproducible and are based on two different anti-CDH1 antibodies α-CDH1N and α-CDH1C (data not shown). The dynamic changes in the localization of CDH1 provide opportunities for a precise temporal and spatial regulation of APC activity during the cell cycle. To further investigate the localization of CDH1 and the functional consequence of CDH1 overexpression in cultured cells, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with pHACDH1, an expression plasmid for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CDH1. The transfected cells were stained with α-CDH1C (Fig. 2A,panel 1) or anti-HA (α-HA, panel 2) antibodies. α-CDH1C reacted with both native (Fig. 2A, panel 1, cells without arrow) and exogenously introduced (cell with an arrow) CDH1 protein, while α-HA recognized the introduced CDH1 only (Fig. 2A, panel 2, cell with an arrow). In addition, we also examined the localization of CDH1 protein fused to GFP (GFPCDH1) in transiently transfected cells (Fig. 2A, panel 3). Notably, a nuclear localization pattern of CDH1 was consistently seen with α-CDH1C, α-HA, or GFPCDH1. This lends further support to the notion that human CDH1 is a nuclear protein. The nuclear localization of CDH1 predicts that it might mediate the APC-dependent proteolysis of nuclear regulators of the cell cycle. Based on this reasoning, we asked how CDH1 might influence APC activity in the nucleus. We overexpressed HA-CDH1 in HeLa cells and co-stained for CDH1 and two nuclear cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin E (Fig. 2B). In this regard, cyclin A is a known substrate of the CDH1-activated APC (59Sørensen C.S. Lukas C. Kramer E.R. Peters J.-M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7613-7623Google Scholar, 60Sørensen C.S. Lukas C. Kramer E.R. Peters J.-M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3692-3703Google Scholar, 61Geley S. Kramer E. Gieffers C. Gannon J. Peters J.-M. Hunt T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 137-147Google Scholar), whereas cyclin E is degraded primarily through the SCF complex (62Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Google Scholar, 63Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.-A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Google Scholar), but not through APC. Consistent with previous studies (57Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E73-E79Google Scholar, 64Jackman M. Kubota Y. den Elzen N. Hagting A. Pines J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1030-1045Google Scholar), ambient cyclin A and cyclin E are predominantly nuclear (Fig. 2B, panels 2and 5). As expected, CDH1 co-localized with cyclin A and cyclin E to the nucleus (Fig. 2B, panels 3 and6). If nuclear CDH1 is functional, it should induce APC-mediated destruction of cyclin A. In contrast, nuclear CDH1 might not affect the steady-state level of cyclin E, which is normally degraded by SCF and not by APC (62Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Google Scholar, 63Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.-A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Google Scholar). Indeed, the forced overexpression of CDH1 correlated with the diminution of nuclear cyclin A (Fig. 2B, panel 2, compare cell with anarrow with cells without arrows), but not cyclin E (panel 5). Thus, human CDH1 functions as an APC activator in the nucleus. In the process of identifying the NLS in CDH1, we noted that a CDH1 protein lacking the amino acid sequences encoded by exons 6 and 7 of human CDH1 gene localized predominantly to the cytoplasm. 2Y. Zhou, Y.-P. Ching, R. W. M. Ng, and D.-Y. Jin, manuscript in preparation. This raises the possibility that exons 6 and 7 of the CDH1 gene could encode an NLS. Indeed, a closer examination of the amino acid sequences encoded by exons 6 and 7 identified a 28-residue stretch (amino acids 151–178) rich in arginines and lysines (Fig.3A, 9 out of 28 residues are positively charged as highlighted by asterisks). This putative NLS is highly conserved from yeast to human and it also contains two conserved CDK phosphorylation sites (serines 151 and 163; Fig. 3A, highlighted by #). To determine whether this is a functional NLS, we expressed in HeLa cells a GFPNLS fusion protein with the putative NLS from CDH1 at the carboxyl terminus. As a control, the GFP protein overexpressed in HeLa cells was diffusely found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig.3B, panel 1 and Fig. 3C, panels 1–3; compare transfected cells with an arrow to untransfected cells without arrows). In contrast, the GFPNLS protein concentrated into the nucleus (Fig. 3, B(panel 2) and C (panels 4–6); co-localization of GFPNLS and the nuclear marker NuMA are inyellow), suggesting that the NLS from CDH1 sufficiently drove the heterologous GFP protein into the nuclear compartment. Thus, amino acids 151–178 of CDH1 harbor a functional NLS. The phosphorylation of CDH1 by CDKs leads to inhibition of its APC-activating activity in cells (7Kotani S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Todokoro K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 791-800Google Scholar, 31Zachariae W. Schwab M. Nasmyth K. Seufert W. Science. 1998; 282: 1721-1724Google Scholar, 32Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 227-236Google Scholar, 33Lukas C. Sørensen C.S. Kramer E. Santoni-Rugiu E. Lindeneg C. Peters J.-M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 1999; 401: 815-818Google Scholar, 34Shirayama M. Toth A. Galova M. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 402: 203-207Google Scholar). In this regard, CDH1 mutants CDH1-4A and CDH-4D with the serine or threonine residues at the four CDK phosphorylation sites replaced by alanines and aspartates, respectively, are very useful for the study of CDH1 because they mimic the constitutive hypo- and hyperphosphorylation states (33Lukas C. Sørensen C.S. Kramer E. Santoni-Rugiu E. Lindeneg C. Peters J.-M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 1999; 401: 815-818Google Scholar, 60Sørensen C.S. Lukas C. Kramer E.R. Peters J.-M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3692-3703Google Scholar). Considered together with the fact that CDH1 and its substrates such as cyclin A and cyclin B1 are all in the nucleus, it would be of interest to see whether phosphorylation of CDH1 might influence its subcellular localization. Importantly, a more recent study in budding yeast has suggested that phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export of CDH1 contributes to efficient inactivation of APC (65Jaquenoud M. van Drogen F. Peter M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6515-6526Google Scholar). In light of this new finding, we asked whether phosphorylation of CDH1 might also regulate its nuclear import or export in cultured human cells. We expressed HA-tagged CDH1-4A and CDH1-4D proteins in HeLa cells and assessed their localization by immunofluorescence microscopy with an α-HA antibody. Notably, CDH1-4A mimicking the hypophosphorylated form was almost constitutively nuclear as shown in its precise co-localization with the nuclear marker NuMA (see Fig.4A, panels 1–3 for an example representative of 797 of the transfected cells). In sharp contrast, the majority of CDH1-4D protein, which mimics the hyperphosphorylated form, was found primarily in the cytoplasm, and its staining pattern overlaps minimally with that of NuMA (see Fig.4A, panels 4–6 for an example representative of 747 of the transfected cells). Thus, phosphorylation of CDH1 correlates with cytoplasmic retention of the protein. Plausibly cytoplasmic sequestration of CDH1 could be a net result caused by enhancement of nuclear export and/or blockade of nuclear import. Consistent with the previous finding that the expression of CDH1-4A but not of CDH1-4D in U2-OS cells resulted in the persistent degradation of cyclin B1 (33Lukas C. Sørensen C.S. Kramer E. Santoni-Rugiu E. Lindeneg C. Peters J.-M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 1999; 401: 815-818Google Scholar), we observed that the accumulation of CDH1-4A correlated with reduction of cyclin A level in the nucleus (Fig. 4B,panels 1–3; steady-state amounts of cyclin A declined in 937 of the transfected cells). This effect is more drastic than that induced by CDH1 wild-type (Fig. 2B, panels 1–3; 687 of the transfected cells had the phenotype). On the contrary, the increase of CDH1-4D in the cytoplasm did not lead to destruction of nuclear cyclin A (Fig. 4B, panels 4–6). Our interpretation to these data is that the cytoplasmic retention of CDH1-4D is causally linked to the loss of its APC-stimulatory activity. This is generally in line with the notion that the constitutively nuclear CDH1-4A is dominantly active whereas constitutively cytoplasmic CDH1-4D is a dominant negative form. We noted that two of four conserved CDK phosphorylation sites targeted in the CDH1-4A and CDH1-4D mutants are located in the vicinity of the NLS of CDH1 (Fig. 3A). Thus, one likely mechanism for the regulation of CDH1 localization is through phosphorylation on serines 151 and 163 near the positively charged residues in NLS. To test this hypothesis, we replaced both serines in the GFPNLS with either alanines or aspartates. Then we separately expressed GFP, GFPNLS as well as the two GFPNLS-2A and GFPNLS-2D mutants in HeLa cells. The GFP-expressing cells gave a bright and homogenous fluorescent signal throughout the cells, suggesting that GFP is evenly distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (see Fig. 5A,panel 1 for one example). Thus the ratio of GFP fluorescence in the nuclear versus in the cytoplasm was close to 1 (Fig.5B). Consistent with data shown in Fig. 3B, the ratio of GFPNLS-specific fluorescent signals in the nuclearversus in the cytoplasm was greater than 4 (Fig.5B), suggesting that GFPNLS targeted the GFP, which was otherwise found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, into the nucleus. Notably, CDH1-4D is constitutively cytoplasmic (Fig. 4,panels 4–6). As such, GFPNLS-2D should also localize to the cytoplasm if phosphorylation near the positively charged residues in the NLS would affect the nuclear localization of CDH1. Indeed, GFPNLS-2D was sufficiently retained in the nucleus-excluded region of the cells (see Fig. 5A, panels 3 and 4for examples). The ratio of GFPNLS-2D-specific fluorescent signals in the nuclear versus in the cytoplasm is therefore lower than 0.5 (Fig. 5B). In line of this, the nuclear accumulation of GFPNLS-2A was even more dramatic than the wild-type GFPNLS (Fig. 5,A, panel 2 and B). These results consistently support the notion that phosphorylation on serines 151 and 163 adjacent to the positively charged residues in NLS sufficiently impedes the nuclear import of CDH1. The phosphorylation of CDH1 by cyclin A/CDK2 has an important regulatory role in orchestrating S-phase progression with mitosis driven by stabilization"

The activation of the enzyme by both substances is dependent on the presence of a prosthetic heme group. It has been unclear whether this prosthetic heme group is sandwiched between the α<sub>1</sub> and ॆ<sub>1</sub> subunits or whether it exclusively binds to the ॆ<sub>1</sub> subunit. Here we analyze progressive amino-terminal deletion mutants of the human α<sub>1</sub> subunit after co-expression with the human ॆ<sub>1</sub> subunit in the baculovirus/Sf9 system. Spectral, biochemical, and pharmacological analysis shows that the first 259 amino acids of the α<sub>1</sub> subunit can be deleted without loss of sensitivity to nitric oxide (NO) or YC-1 or loss of heme binding of the respective enzyme complex with the ॆ<sub>1</sub>subunit. This is in contrast to previous data indicating that NO sensitivity and a functional heme binding site requires full-length amino termini of bovine α<sub>1</sub> and ॆ<sub>1</sub> subunits. Further deletion of the first 364 amino acids of the α<sub>1</sub>subunit leads to an enzyme complex with preserved heme binding but loss of sensitivity to NO or YC-1 despite induction of the typical spectral shift by NO binding to the prosthetic heme group. We conclude that 1) the amino-terminal part of the α<sub>1</sub> subunit is not involved in heme binding and 2) amino acids 259–364 of the α<sub>1</sub> subunit represent an important functional domain for the transduction of the NO activation signal and likely represent the target for NO-sensitizing substances like YC-1."
https://openalex.org/W2092604263,"Neuroactive steroids modulate the function of γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptors in the central nervous system by an unknown mechanism. In this study we have used a novel neuroactive steroid analogue, 3α,5β-6-azi-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (6-AziP), as a photoaffinity labeling reagent to identify neuroactive steroid binding sites in rat brain. 6-AziP is an effective modulator of GABAA receptors as evidenced by its ability to inhibit binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate to rat brain membranes and to potentiate GABA-elicited currents inXenopus oocytes and human endothelial kidney 293 cells expressing GABAA receptor subunits (α1β2γ2). [3H]6-AziP produced time- and concentration-dependent photolabeling of protein bands of ∼35 and 60 kDa in rat brain membranes. The 35-kDa band was half-maximally labeled at a [3H]6-AziP concentration of 1.9 μm, whereas the 60-kDa band was labeled at higher concentrations. The photolabeled 35-kDa protein was isolated from rat brain by two-dimensional PAGE and identified as voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC-1) by both matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight and ESI-tandem mass spectrometry. Monoclonal antibody directed against the N terminus of VDAC-1 immunoprecipitated labeled 35-kDa protein from a lysate of rat brain membranes, confirming that VDAC-1 is the species labeled by [3H]6-AziP. The β2and β3 subunits of the GABAA receptor were co-immunoprecipitated by the VDAC-1 antibody suggesting a physical association between VDAC-1 and GABAA receptors in rat brain membranes. These data suggest that neuroactive steroid effects on the GABAA receptor may be mediated by binding to an accessory protein, VDAC-1. Neuroactive steroids modulate the function of γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptors in the central nervous system by an unknown mechanism. In this study we have used a novel neuroactive steroid analogue, 3α,5β-6-azi-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (6-AziP), as a photoaffinity labeling reagent to identify neuroactive steroid binding sites in rat brain. 6-AziP is an effective modulator of GABAA receptors as evidenced by its ability to inhibit binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate to rat brain membranes and to potentiate GABA-elicited currents inXenopus oocytes and human endothelial kidney 293 cells expressing GABAA receptor subunits (α1β2γ2). [3H]6-AziP produced time- and concentration-dependent photolabeling of protein bands of ∼35 and 60 kDa in rat brain membranes. The 35-kDa band was half-maximally labeled at a [3H]6-AziP concentration of 1.9 μm, whereas the 60-kDa band was labeled at higher concentrations. The photolabeled 35-kDa protein was isolated from rat brain by two-dimensional PAGE and identified as voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC-1) by both matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight and ESI-tandem mass spectrometry. Monoclonal antibody directed against the N terminus of VDAC-1 immunoprecipitated labeled 35-kDa protein from a lysate of rat brain membranes, confirming that VDAC-1 is the species labeled by [3H]6-AziP. The β2and β3 subunits of the GABAA receptor were co-immunoprecipitated by the VDAC-1 antibody suggesting a physical association between VDAC-1 and GABAA receptors in rat brain membranes. These data suggest that neuroactive steroid effects on the GABAA receptor may be mediated by binding to an accessory protein, VDAC-1. γ-aminobutyric acid GABA, type A 3α,5β-6-azi-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid human endothelial kidney matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate voltage-dependent anion channel tetrahydrofuran electrospray ionization Certain endogenous pregnane steroids and their structural analogues are potent anesthetics in vertebrates (1Selye H.

Chem. 1965; 8: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These neuroactive steroids produce a rapid and reversible depression of the central nervous system indicating that their actions, unlike those of other steroid hormones, are not mediated by transcriptional regulation. In the 1980s it was demonstrated that neuroactive steroids could modulate the function of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA),1 type A (GABAA) receptors in the central nervous system (3Majewska M.D. Harrison N.L. Schwartz R.D. Barker J.L. Paul S.M. Science. 1986; 232: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar, 4Harrison N.L. Simmonds M.A. Brain Res. 1984; 323: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 5Harrison N.L. Vicini S. Barker J.L. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 604-609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low concentrations of the steroids potentiate the actions of GABA whereas higher concentrations directly open the GABAA receptor ion channel (6Cottrell G.A. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 90: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 7Barker J.L. Harrison N.L. Lange G.D. Owen D.G. J. Physiol. 1987; 386: 485-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that neuroactive steroids produce anesthesia by activating GABAAreceptors and thus enhancing inhibitory synaptic transmission. The strong correlation between the ability of various neuroactive steroid analogues to modulate GABAA receptors and their ability to produce anesthesia strongly supports this hypothesis (8Harrison N.L. Majewska M.D. Harrington J.W. Barker J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 241: 346-353PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which neuroactive steroids modulate GABAAreceptor function remains unclear. In previous work we have tested the enantiomers of allopregnanolone (9Wittmer L.L. Hu Y. Kalkbrenner M. Evers A.S. Zorumski C. Covey D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1581-1586PubMed Google Scholar) and pregnanolone (10Covey D.F. Nathan D. Kalkbrenner M. Nilsson K.R. Hu Y. Zorumski C.F. Evers A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 1009-1116PubMed Google Scholar) for their abilities to produce anesthesia and to modulate GABAAreceptor function. These studies showed that both steroid anesthesia and steroid modulation of GABAA receptor function are highly enantioselective, particularly in the case of allopregnanolone. This indicates that neuroactive steroids most likely act via binding to specific recognition sites on the GABAA receptor protein complex, because the enantiomeric pairs have identical physical properties but mirror image shapes. Potentiation of GABA action by neuroactive steroids does not require any specific GABAAsubunit (11Sanna E. Murgia A. Casula A. Biggio G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 484-490PubMed Google Scholar) although the absence of the δ subunit does decrease the sensitivity of the receptor to neuroactive steroids (12Mihalek R.M. Banerjee P.K. Korpi E.R. Quinlan J.J. Firestone L.L. Mi Z.P. Lagenaur C. Tretter V. Sieghart W. Anagnostaras S.G. Sage J.R. Fanselow M.S. Guidotti A. Spigelman I. Li Z. DeLorey T.M. Olsen R.W. Homanics G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12905-12910Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Radioligand binding studies and electrophysiological studies indicate that the putative neuroactive steroid binding sites are not identical to or overlapping with the identified binding sites for benzodiazepines (13Turner D.M. Ransom R.W. Yang J.S. Olsen R.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 248: 960-966PubMed Google Scholar), GABA (13Turner D.M. Ransom R.W. Yang J.S. Olsen R.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 248: 960-966PubMed Google Scholar) or picrotoxin (3Majewska M.D. Harrison N.L. Schwartz R.D. Barker J.L. Paul S.M. Science. 1986; 232: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) or to the putative binding site for barbiturates (13Turner D.M. Ransom R.W. Yang J.S. Olsen R.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 248: 960-966PubMed Google Scholar, 14Callachan H. Cottrell G.A. Hather N.Y. Lambert J.J. Nooney J.M. Peters J.A. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1987; 231: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A variety of anesthetic agents, including propofol, etomidate, benzodiazepines, and the halogenated alkanes and ethers, have also been shown to modulate GABAA receptor function (15Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Specific binding sites for some of these agents have been identified using two approaches (16Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar): (i) direct or analogue photolabeling and (ii) generating chimeric subunits between anesthetic-sensitive and insensitive subunits to identify regions of the GABAAreceptor involved in binding and then using site-directed mutagenesis to identify specific amino acids required for anesthetic effect. For example photoaffinity labeling has been successfully used in locating the benzodiazepine (17Mohler H. Battersby M.K. Richards J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1666-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 18Duncalfe L.L. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L.B. Martin I.L. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) binding sites on the GABAA receptor. Generation of chimeric subunits followed by site-directed mutagenesis has led to the identification of specific amino acids that are critical for the actions of fluorinated ether (20Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.D. Valenzueala C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.D. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) and alkane anesthetics (21Greenblatt E.P. Meng X. Anesthesiology. 2001; 94: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), etomidate (22Hill-Venning C. Belelli D. Paters J.A. Lambert J.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 23Belleli D. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Wafford K. Whiting P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 92: 11031-11036Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and propofol (24Krasowski M.D. Koltchine V.V. Rick C.E. Ye Q. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although there remains controversy as to whether these critical amino acids (located at the extracellular end of M2 and M3) are part of a binding site, evidence is accumulating that there is an anesthetic binding pocket formed by residues from M1, M2, M3, and M4 (25Yamakura T. Bertaccini E. Trudell J.R. Harris R.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 26Jenkins A. Greenblatt E.P. Faulkner J.H. Bertaccini E. Light A. Lin A. Andreasen A. Viner A. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations do not affect the actions of neuroactive steroids (20Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.D. Valenzueala C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.D. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). There has been one report that a large region (between the N terminus and the M2 segment) in a β subunit can affect neuroactive steroid action (27Rick C.E. Ye Q. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but no further studies have substantiated or refined this observation. Thus molecular biological studies have, to date, failed to identify candidate regions or sites on the GABAAreceptor that may contribute to a neuroactive steroid binding site. To identify binding sites for the neuroactive steroids, we have developed a steroid anesthetic analogue, 6-AziP, that functions as a photolabeling reagent. Here we describe the synthesis and the characterization of this photolabeling reagent and identification of the major photolabeled protein in rat brain membranes. Rat brains were purchased from Pel-freez (Rogers, AK) and stored until use at −20 °C. Cerebella and brain stem were trimmed from the frozen brains, and the cerebral hemispheres were used to prepare membranes with minor modification of previously described methods (28Hawkinson J. Drewe J.A. Kimbrough C.L. Chen J. Hogenkamp D.J. Lan N.J. Gee K.W. Shen K. Whittemore E.R. Woodward R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 897-906PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were immersed in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose (10 ml/g) and homogenized using a Teflon pestle in a motor-driven homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 × g, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g to obtain the P2 pellet, which was washed three times with 50 mm potassium phosphate/200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate/200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and recollected by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 ×g. The final pellet was resuspended using a Teflon homogenizer and stored at −80 °C. QT-6 and HEK 293 cells were maintained in culture using standard methods (29Paradiso K. Sabey K. Evers A.S. Zorumski C.F. Covey D.F. Steinbach J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cells were passaged at subconfluent densities and were not passaged more than 15 times. Stably transfected cells were produced by standard methods (30Sabey K. Paradiso K. Zhang J. Steinbach J.H. Mol. Pharmcol. 1999; 55: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, rat α1 subunit cDNA (provided by Dr. A. Tobin) was transferred to pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and epitope-tagged with the Myc epitope between amino acids 4 and 5 of the predicted mature peptide. Human β1 cDNA (provided by Dr. P. Whiting) was epitope-tagged with the FLAG epitope and transferred to pcDNA3. Quail QT-6 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (31Ueno S. Zorumski C. Bracamontes J. Steinbach J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 931-938PubMed Google Scholar), and cells resistant to G418 were selected. A population of cells expressing high levels of surface FLAG and Myc epitopes were selected by sequential rounds of immunoselection using anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) and anti-Myc antibody (9E10; Invitrogen) (30Sabey K. Paradiso K. Zhang J. Steinbach J.H. Mol. Pharmcol. 1999; 55: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The enriched population of cells was not cloned. To maximize receptor expression, 2 mm sodium butyrate and 5 mm aminopurine were added to the transfected cells 48 h prior to harvest. Membranes were generated from harvested cells (cells were harvested, and membranes were made in the presence of 0.01 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.01 mg/ml ova trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mmEDTA) by homogenization in a Tekmar tissue homogenizer followed by centrifugation at 22,000 × g. Membranes were stored at −80 °C for subsequent use. [3H]6-Azi-pregnanolone ([3H]6-AziP) was prepared by multi-step synthesis from commercially available progesterone as outlined in Fig.1. Progesterone was first converted into its 3,20-diketal. The double bond of the 3,20-diketal was then subjected to a hydroboration reaction to introduce a 6-hydroxyl group into the steroid. The 6-hydroxyl group was then oxidized to a 6-keto group. The 6-keto group was then converted into the 6-diaziryl group, and the diketal protecting groups were then removed. Selective reduction of the 3-keto group in the 6-azi-3,20-diketone precursor yields 6-AziP. Selective reduction of the 3-keto group in the same precursor with sodium borotritiide yields [3-3H]6-AziP. Details of the synthetic chemistry are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Melting points were determined on a micro hot stage and are uncorrected. NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature at 300 MHz (1H) or 75 MHz (13C). For 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra, the internal references were tetramethylsilane (δ = 0.00 ppm) and CDCl3 (δ = 77.00 ppm). Elemental analyses were carried out by M-H-W Laboratories, Phoenix, AZ. Solvents were either used as purchased or dried and purified by standard methodology. Extraction solvents were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and removed on a rotary evaporator under water aspirator vacuum. Column chromatography was performed using flash column grade silica gel (32–63 μm) purchased from Scientific Adsorbents, Atlanta, GA. A solution of borane-tetrahydrofuran complex (1.7 ml, 1 m borane in tetrahydrofuran) was added dropwise at room temperature to a stirred solution of 3,20-diketal1 (234.4 mg, 0.58 mmol; prepared from progesterone in the usual manner (32Antonucci R. Bernstein S. Lenhard R. Sax K.J. Williams J.H. J. Org. Chem. 1952; 17: 1369-1374Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar)) in tetrahydrofuran (THF; 30 ml). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 h. After cooling to 0 °C in an ice-water bath, 3 n aqueous sodium hydroxide (1.7 ml) and 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (1.7 ml) were added. Immediately following the addition of the hydrogen peroxide, the cooling bath was removed, and the mixture was stirred overnight. After removal of the THF on a rotary evaporator, the residue was mixed with diethyl ether (Et2O; 200 ml), and the Et2O was washed with water and brine and then dried and removed. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel e1uted with 5–20% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to give products 2 (131.1 mg),3 (47.3 mg), and 4 (41.6 mg) in a ratio of 3.2:1.1:1 in a total yield of 90%. (5β,6β)-6-Hydroxypregnane-3,20-dione, cyclic bis(1,2-ethanediyl acetal) (2) was obtained as a white solid, and properties were as follows: m.p. 201–203 °C; IR (KBr) 3529, 2942, 2874, 1052, 1018 cm−1; 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 3.77–3.94 (8H, m), 3.64 (1H, bs), 1.23 (3H, s), 1.07 (3H, s), 0.71 (3H, s); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 111.89, 109.34, 72.52, 65.04, 64.12, 64.01, 63.07, 58.20, 56.13, 47.50, 42.00, 40.00, 39.55, 35.62, 34.48, 34.19, 34.02, 29.94, 29.50, 25.13, 24.36, 23.55, 22.81, 20.44, 12.88.

Elemental analysis results for C25H40O5 were as follows. Predicted: C, 71.39%; H, 9.59%; found: C, 71.24%; H, 9.68%. (5α)-5-Hydroxypregnane-3,20-dione, cyclic bis(1,2-ethanediyl acetal) (4) was obtained as a white solid that was only partially characterized. The stereochemistry assigned to the hydroxyl group in the structure should be considered as tentative. 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 3.78–3.95 (8H, m), 2.25 (1H, d,J = 14.1 Hz), 1.22 (3H, s), 0.87 (3H, s), 0.68 (3H, s);13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 111.91, 110.13, 74.71, 65.10, 64.31, 63.93, 63.11, 58.14, 56.42, 43.16, 41.82, 40.20, 39.50, 34.42, 34.05, 29.88, 28.83, 28.15, 24.37, 23.58, 22.81, 21.20, 16.39, 12.81. Pyridinium dichromate (5.63 g, 14.97 mmol) was added to a solution of steroid 2 (1.68 g, 4.00 mmol) in dichloromethane (30 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 h and diluted with Et2O. The Et2O solution was washed with water and then brine and dried. Solvent removal gave a residue that was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (10% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to give steroid 5(1.64 g, 98.3%) as a white solid. Properties were as follows: m.p. 133–135 °C; IR (KBr) 2949, 2867, 1708, 1089 cm−1;1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 3.85–4.02 (8H, m), 2.36 (1H, dd, J = 13.5 Hz, 5.2 Hz), 1.30 (3H, s), 0.87 (3H, s), 0.75 (3H, s); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 213.78, 111.75, 108.02, 65.13, 64.33, 64.30, 63.16, 58.36, 58.08, 56.71, 42.61, 42.43, 39.32, 39.24, 37.82, 36.33, 34.31, 33.25, 30.09, 24.43, 23.41, 22.88, 22.78, 20.82, 12.82. Elemental analysis results for C25H38O5 were as follows. Predicted: C, 71.74%; H, 9.15%; found: C, 71.67%; H, 9.29%. Anhydrous ammonia gas was bubbled into a stirred solution of steroid 5 (304.1 mg, 0.73 mmol) in absolute MeOH (25 ml) at 0 °C until the MeOH was saturated. The solution was further stirred at 0 °C for 2 h. Then, a solution of hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid (391.4 mg, 3.46 mmol) in MeOH (6 ml) was added at 0 °C, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. After filtration to remove precipitated ammonium sulfate the filtrate was mixed with MeOH (30 ml), ethyl acetate (5 ml), and triethylamine (1 ml). Iodine dissolved in MeOH was then added dropwise while stirring until a yellow color persisted. The mixture was diluted with Et2O (300 ml), and the Et2O was washed successively with 10% aqueous sodium thiosulfate, water, and brine and dried. The residue obtained after solvent removal was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (5% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to give a mixture of diazirines (56.3 mg, 51.1% yield), recovered starting material, and the 5α-epimer of the starting material (196.9 mg total for the combined 5β- and 5α-epimers). Treatment of the mixture of diazirines (56.3 mg) withp-toluenesulfonic acid (35.7 mg) in acetone (10 ml) gave, after column chromatography on silica gel (10% ethyl acetate in hexanes), the purified products 6 (16.1 mg) and 7(20.9 mg). Product 6 (16.1 mg) was a solid, and properties were as follows: m.p. 136–138 °C; IR (KBr) 2942, 2908, 1718, 1708, 1351, 1150 cm−1; 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 2.70 (1H, dd, J = 15.3 Hz, 13.2 Hz), 2.56 (1H, t,J = 9.3 Hz), 2.14 (3H, s), 1.29 (3H, s), 0.69 (3H, s), 0.62 (1H, dd, J = 13.2 Hz, 4.8 Hz), 0.38 (1H, dd,J = 13.5 Hz, 3.6 Hz); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 210.09, 209.20, 63.42, 56.19, 50.29, 44.11, 40.41, 38.68, 37.16, 36.66, 36.36, 35.77, 33.78, 32.40, 31.38, 28.29, 23.98, 22.78, 22.23, 20.88, 13.28. Elemental analysis results for C21H30N2O2 were as follows. Predicted: C, 73.65%; H, 8.83%; N, 8.18%; found: C, 73.76%; H, 8.73%; N, 8.16%. Product 7 (20.9 mg) was a solid, and properties were as follows: decomposed on heating above 152 °C; IR (KBr) 2949, 2867, 1704, 1354, 1235 cm−1; 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 2.53 (1H, t, J = 9.0 Hz), 2.13 (3H, s), 1.35 (3H, s), 0.68 (3H, s), 0.48 (1H, dd, J = 13.8 Hz, 4.2 Hz); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 209.87, 209.29, 63.39, 55.86, 53.02, 46.54, 43.99, 39.47, 38.51, 37.74, 37.66, 37.30, 36.95, 33.61, 31.35, 28.74, 23.98, 22.66, 21.21, 13.28, 12.20. Lithium tri-t-butoxyaluminium hydride (37.3 mg, 0.15 mmol) in THF (0.3 ml) was added to a stirred solution of steroid 6 (49.3 mg, 0.14 mmol) in THF (10 ml) at 0 °C. The reaction was stirred at 0 °C until monitoring by silica gel thin layer chromatography (30% ethyl acetate in hexanes) showed that the starting material had reacted completely. The reaction was quenched by adding acetone (0.5 ml). Water (5 ml) was then added, and the product was extracted into Et2O. Solvent removal gave a residue that was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (15% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to give azisteroid 8 (40.4 mg, 81.5%) as a white solid. Properties were as follows: m.p. 95–97 °C; IR (KBr) 3392, 2935, 2867, 1701, 1354, 1059 cm−1;1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 3.51 (1H, m), 2.54 (1H, t,J = 9.3 Hz), 2.13 (3H, s), 1.18 (3H, s), 0.64 (3H, s), 0.28 (1H, dd, J = 14.4 Hz, 4.2 Hz), 0.20 (1H, dd,J = 12.9 Hz, 4.2 Hz); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 209.50, 70.31, 63.51, 56.29, 48.52, 44.17, 39.64, 38.77, 36.28, 34.42, 33.86, 32.90, 31.38, 31.20, 29.61, 28.97, 24.01, 22.93, 22.72, 20.44, 13.23. Elemental analysis results for C21H32N2O2 were as follows. Predicted: C, 73.22%; H, 9.63%; N, 8.13%; found: C, 73.16%; H, 9.30%; N, 8.38%. [3H]NaBH4 in 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH (Amersham Biosciences, 25 mCi, specific activity 23 Ci mmol−1) was added to a stirred solution of azisteroid 6 (2.046 mg, 5.98 μmol) in ethanol (2 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. A drop of acetic acid and then water (1 ml) were added. The mixture was extracted with Et2O (4 × 1.5 ml). The combined organic phases were evaporated under a stream of air, and the residue was dissolved in chloroform (300 μl) and subjected to preparative TLC (hexane:ethyl acetate, 1:1). Radioactive bands on the dried plate were visualized by photoimaging. The only detectable products were [3H]azisteroid 9 and a band of slightly higher mobility, presumably the epimeric 3α-hydroxysteroid, [3-3H](3α,5β)-6-Azi-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (10), in a ratio of 2.4:1. The radioactive bands were scraped from the plate, and the silica gel was packed in a small pipette and washed with ethyl acetate (4 ml). [3H]Azisteroid 9 (8.2 mCi) and presumed [3H]azisteroid 10 (3.5 mCi) were obtained after solvent removal. The purified radiolabeled products were stored in ethanol at −20 °C. To assure the purity of 6-AziP and [3H]6-AziP, each of the steroids was analyzed by thin layer chromatography before and after ultraviolet irradiation. Ethanolic solutions of the steroids were irradiated for 5 min using a 450-watt Hanovia medium pressure mercury lamp. The steroid samples were applied to reverse-phase silica chromatography plates (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and developed with a mobile phase of 95% acetonitrile/5% H2O. Detection was facilitated by charring the plates following an aerosol application of 5% sulfuric acid/95% ethanol. The Rf values for non-irradiated 6-AziP was 0.53, whereas the Rfvalue for irradiated 6-AziP was 0.42. Using a charred TLC plate as a guide, TLC plates containing [3H]6-AziP were scored into 5-mm bands and scraped. Radiolabeled steroid was extracted from silica into chloroform:methanol (2:1) and analyzed by scintillation spectrometry using Scintilene scintillation mixture (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). TLC was also conducted using straight phase HP-K high performance silica gel TLC plates (Whatman catalog number 4807-700) and a 1:1 hexane:ethyl acetate solvent system. [35S]TBPS binding assays were performed using previously described methods (10Covey D.F. Nathan D. Kalkbrenner M. Nilsson K.R. Hu Y. Zorumski C.F. Evers A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Briefly, aliquots of membrane suspension (0.5 mg/ml final protein concentration in assay) were incubated with 5 μm GABA (Sigma), 2–4 nm[35S]TBPS (60–100 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 5-μl aliquots of steroid in Me2SO solution (final steroid concentrations ranged from 1 nm to 10 μm), in a total volume of 1 ml of 200 mmNaCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Control binding was defined as binding observed in the presence of 0.5% Me2SO and the absence of steroid; all assays contained 0.5% Me2SO. Nonspecific binding was defined as binding observed in the presence of 200 μm picrotoxin and ranged from 6.1 to 14.3% of total binding. Assay tubes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. A Brandel (Gaithersburg, MD) cell harvester was used for filtration of the assay tubes through Whatman/GF/C filter paper. Filter paper was rinsed with 4 ml of ice-cold buffer three times and dissolved in 4 ml of ScintiVerse II (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Radioactivity bound to the filters (B) was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry, and data were fit using Sigma Plot to the Hill equation, B= Bmax/{1 + ([C]/IC50)n}, whereBmax is control binding, [C] is steroid concentration, IC50 is the half-maximal inhibitor concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient. Each data point was determined in triplicate. [3H]muscimol binding assays were performed using a previously described method with minor modification (4Harrison N.L. Simmonds M.A. Brain Res. 1984; 323: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 34Lopez-Colome A.M. McCarthy M. Beyer C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 176: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were thawed and washed four times in 20 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, to remove endogenous GABA. Binding incubations contained aliquots of membrane suspension (0.5 mg/ml final protein concentration in assay), 5 nm[3H]muscimol (28 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10 μm steroid, and 20 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Assay tubes were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark. Control binding was defined as binding observed in the presence of 0.5% Me2SO and the absence of steroid; all assays contained 0.5% Me2SO. Nonspecific binding was defined as binding observed in the presence of 100 μmGABA. Assays were conducted in the presence or the absence of 10 μm 6-AziP or pregnanolone. Membranes were collected on Whatman/GF/C glass filter paper using a Brandel cell harvester (Gaithersburg, MD). Radioactivity bound to the filters was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry using ScintiVerse II (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Each data point was determined in triplicate. Stage V-VI oocytes were harvested from sexually mature female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus One, Northland, MI) anesthetized with 0.1% tricaine (3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester), according to institutionally approved protocols. Oocytes were defolliculated by shaking for 20 min at 37 °C in collagenase (2 mg/ml) dissolved in calcium-free solution containing the following (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES at pH 7.4.

Much, but not all, of this complex is tethered to disk membranes by the transmembrane protein R9AP. To determine the effect of the R9AP membrane complex on GAP activity, we purified recombinant R9AP and reconstituted it into lipid vesicles along with the photon receptor rhodopsin. Full-length RGS9-1·Gβ5 bound to R9AP-containing vesicles with high affinity (Kd < 10 nm), but constructs lacking the DEP (dishevelled/EGL-10/pleckstrin) domain bound with much lower affinity, and binding of those lacking the entire N-terminal domain (i.e. the dishevelled/EGL-10/pleckstrin domain plus intervening domain) was not detectable. Formation of the membrane-bound complex with R9AP increased RGS9-1 GAP activity by a factor of 4. Vesicle titrations revealed that on the time scale of phototransduction, the entire reaction sequence from GTP uptake to GAP-catalyzed hydrolysis is a membrane-delimited process, and exchange of Gαt between membrane surfaces is much slower than hydrolysis. Because in rod cells different pools exist of RGS9-1·Gβ5 that are either associated with R9AP or not, regulation of the association between R9AP and RGS9-1·Gβ5 represents a potential mechanism for the regulation of recovery kinetics.

We compared the uptake of HPV16 virus-like particles (VLPs) either with or without the minor capsid protein L2. Whereas VLPs containing only the major capsid protein L1 were diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm even 6 h post-infection, VLPs comprising both L1 and L2 exhibited a radial distribution in the cytoplasm and accumulated in the perinuclear region of BPHE-1 cells within 2 h. L2 of HPV16 or bovine papillomavirus was shown to bind to a 43-kDa cellular protein that was subsequently identified as ॆ-actin by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis. A conserved domain comprising residues 25–45 of HPV16 L2 was sufficient for interaction with ॆ-actin. HPV16 L2 residues 25–45 fused to green fluorescent protein, but not green fluorescent protein alone, colocalized with actin and caused cell retraction and disruption of the microfilament network. Finally, wild-type L2, but not L2 with residues 25–45 deleted, facilitated HPV16 pseudovirion infection. Thus, binding of ॆ-actin by L2 residues 25–45 facilitates transport of HPV16 across the cytoplasm during infection, and blockade of this novel interaction may be useful for prophylaxis.

Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 192: 189-221Google Scholar). Thus, many intracellular pathogens subvert existing transport mechanisms and cytoskeletal components, both to efficiently reach their site of replication and also for the exit of their progeny (2Sodeik B. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 465-472Google Scholar). The cytoskeleton is highly dynamic, and its role in locomotion is regulated by a plethora of actin- and tubulin-binding proteins, kinases, and phosphatases of multiple signaling cascades. Changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of actin regulatory proteins induce the condensation of actin 舠comet舡 tails behind endosomes (3Taunton J. Rowning B.A. Coughlin M.L. Wu M. Moon R.T. Mitchison T.J. Larabell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 519-530Google Scholar), as well as the bacteria Listeria, Shigella, andRickettsia (4Dramsi S. Cossart P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 137-166Google Scholar) and viruses including vaccinia, baculovirus, and SV40, for propulsion through the cytoplasm (5Cudmore S. Reckmann I. Way M. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 142-148Google Scholar, 6Pelkmans L. Puntener D. Helenius A. Science. 2002; 296: 535-539Google Scholar). Other viruses employ cellular motors such as dyneins and kinesins for transport along microtubules. A single virus type can employ several intracellular transport mechanisms. Indeed, vaccinia particles are driven along microtubules by kinesin, whereupon actin tails take over propulsion (7Rietdorf J. Ploubidou A. Reckmann I. Holmstrom A. Frischknecht F. Zettl M. Zimmermann T. Way M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 992-1000Google Scholar,8Moss B. Ward B.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E245-E246Google Scholar). Compelling epidemiologic and molecular virologic studies demonstrate that infection with an oncogenic type human papillomavirus (HPV),1 typified by HPV16, is a necessary cause of cervical cancer (9Walboomers J.M. Jacobs M.V. Manos M.M. Bosch F.X. Kummer J.A. Shah K.V. Snijders P.J. Peto J. Meijer C.J. Muñoz N. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 12-19Google Scholar). In the absence of effective screening programs, cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women (10Pisani P. Parkin D.M. Bray F. Ferlay J. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 18-29Google Scholar). Furthermore, oncogenic HPV infection is also strongly associated with vulval, anal, and penile cancers, some non-melanoma skin cancers, and esophageal and salivary cancers (11zur Hausen H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 342-350Google Scholar). An understanding of the infectious process is critical to rational development of approaches for prevention of HPV-related cancers. Although several cellular molecules, including heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (12Joyce J.G. Tung J.S. Przysiecki C.T. Cook J.C. Lehman E.D. Sands J.A. Jansen K.U. Keller P.M. J. Biol.

Velders M.P. Nieland J.D. Schiller J.T. Nickoloff B.J. Kast W.M. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 633-641Google Scholar), have been implicated as cell-surface receptors for papillomavirus, little else is known about cellular proteins that mediate cytoplasmic transport of papillomavirus and delivery of the viral genome to the nucleus. The papillomavirus capsid comprises the major capsid protein L1 arranged as 72 pentamers, or capsomers, in a T=7d icosahedral surface lattice (15Baker T.S. Newcomb W.W. Olson N.H. Cowsert L.M. Olson C. Brown J.C. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 1445-1456Google Scholar, 16Hagensee M.E. Olson N.H. Baker T.S. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4503-4505Google Scholar) and a minor capsid protein, L2 (17Doorbar J. Gallimore P.H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2793-2799Google Scholar), one molecule of which may be located at each vertex (18Trus B.L. Roden R.B. Greenstone H.L. Vrhel M. Schiller J.T. Booy F.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 413-420Google Scholar). Overexpression of L1 alone is sufficient to form empty capsids, termed virus-like particles (VLPs) (19Kirnbauer R. Booy F. Cheng N. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12180-12184Google Scholar). L1 VLPs bind to cell surfaces and compete with bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1) infection in vitro (20Roden R.B. Kirnbauer R. Jenson A.B. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7260-7266Google Scholar). However, both L1 and L2 are necessary for efficient production of papillomavirus and infection (21Zhou J. Stenzel D.J. Sun X.Y. Frazer I.H. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 763-768Google Scholar, 22Roden R.B. Greenstone H.L. Kirnbauer R. Booy F.P. Jessie J. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J.

Recent studies by Kawanaet al. (24Kawana Y. Kawana K. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Yoshiike K. Kanda T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2331-2336Google Scholar, 25Kawana K. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Yoshiike K. Kanda T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6188-6190Google Scholar) suggest that residues 108–120 of L2 are displayed upon the virion exterior and bind to the cell surface, resulting in internalization. Furthermore, anti-L2 antiserum neutralizes papillomavirus without preventing virion binding to the cell surface (26Roden R.B. Weissinger E.M. Henderson D.W. Booy F. Kirnbauer R. Mushinski J.F. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7570-7574Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that L2 plays a critical role in infection, but is not required for interaction of papillomavirus particles with the cell surface (23Roden R.B. Day P.M. Bronzo B.K. Yutzy IV, W.H. Yang Y. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 2001; 75 (W. H.): 10493-10497Google Scholar). Taken together, the data suggest that L1 mediates the initial binding of virions to the cell surface, whereas L2 provides later functions critical for infection. VLPs containing L1 and L2, only L1, or L1 and L2 lacking residues 25–45 were generated by infection of Sf9 with recombinant baculoviruses and purified as previously reported (27Kirnbauer R. Taub J. Greenstone H. Roden R. Durst M. Gissmann L. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6929-6936Google Scholar). The HPV16 L2Δ25–45 deletion mutant was prepared by two rounds of PCR using oligonucleotides CGCGGATCCATGCGACACAAACGTTCTGC and CCCATACTTCCATATTGTAACTGTTTGCATGTTTTATAAAG or TCCCCCCGGGCTAGGCAGCCAAAGAGAC and CTTTATAAAAACATGCAAACAGTTACAATATGGAAGTATGGG, followed by just the outside primers. The quantity and quality of VLP preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electron microscopy, respectively. His6-tagged BPV1 L2 fusion proteins were prepared as previously described (26Roden R.B. Weissinger E.M. Henderson D.W. Booy F. Kirnbauer R. Mushinski J.F. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7570-7574Google Scholar). For generation of glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-tagged L2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins, L2 oligonucleotides with EcoRI andSalI overhangs were directly synthesized (HPV16 L2-(13–31), AATTCGCATCGGCTACCCAACTTTATAAAACATGCAAACAGGCAGGTACATGTCCACCTGACGG and TCGACCGTCAGGTGGACATGTACCTGCCTGTTTGCATGTTTTATAAAGTTGGGTAGCCGATGCG; HPV16 L2-(25–45), AATTCGCAGGTACATGTCCACCTGACATTATACCTAAGGTTGAAGGCAAAACTATTGCTGAT CAAATAGG and TCGACCTATTTGATCAGCAATAGTTTTGCCTTCAACCTTAGGTATAATGTCAGGTGGACATGTACCTGCG; HPV16 L2-(61–81), AATTCGGAACAGGGTCGGGTACAGGCGGACGCACTGGGTATATTCCATTGGGAACAAGGCCTCCCACAGG and TCGACCTGTGGGAGGCCTTGTTCCCAATGGAATATACCCAGTGCGTCCGCCTGTACCCGACCCTGTTCCG; and HPV16 L2-(108–126), AATTCTTAGTGGAAGAAACTAGTTTTATTGATGCTGGTGCACCAACATCTGTACCTTCCATCGG and TCGACCGATGGAAGGTACAGATGTTGGTGCACCAGCATCAATAAAACTAGTTTCTTCCACTAAG) or amplified by PCR using HPV16 L2-(1–128) (primers GCAGAATTCATGCGACACAAACGTTCTGCA and GCAGGTCGACTGGGGGAATGGAAGGTAC) and HPV16 L2-(299–333) (primers GCAGAATTCACTGGCATTAGGTACAGT and GCAGGTCGACTTCTTCTGCAGGATCAATAGT). Expression of the recombinant GST-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 and their purification on a GSTrapTM FF column (Amersham Biosciences) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 107 fetal calf serum containing 35S-radiolabeled methionine and cysteine (0.2 mCi/ml) and harvested in ice-cold buffer A (10 mmHEPES (pH 7), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mmn-octyl ॆ-d-glucopyranoside with Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the lysate was precleared with 100 ॖl of protein G-Sepharose and 20 ॖg/ml isotypic control antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. After addition of His6- or GFP-tagged fusion protein, immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-His5 or anti-GFP monoclonal antibody, respectively, and protein G-Sepharose for 16 h at 4 °C with slow agitation. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times with ice-cold lysis buffer and resolved by 107 SDS-PAGE. After treating with 507 (v/v) methanol and 107 (v/v) acetic acid and then AmplifyTM (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, the gel was dried under vacuum at 60–80 °C, and the incorporated35S was visualized by autoradiography. GST-HPV16 L2-(1–128)-GFP was bound to a GSTrap FF column, and detergent extracts of 109 SiHa cells in buffer A were passed over the column. After extensive washing, the column was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm reduced glutathione at pH 8.0. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The 43-kDa protein band was excised and digested with TPCK-treated sequencing grade trypsin (Worthington) as previously described (28Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar). The masses of the resulting peptides were measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis on a Voyager DE STR apparatus (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Positive ion mass spectra were analyzed using Data Explorer (Version 3.5). Mass accuracy was better than 100 ppm. ॆ-Actin was identified by using the monoisotopic masses acquired from the 43-kDa protein to search the NCBI Non-redundant Database using the MS-Fit search engine on the Protein Prospector Web site. 2Available at prospector.ucsf.edu. After fixation for 5 min in 3.77 paraformaldehyde and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were permeabilized with 17 (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min. The cells were incubated with the L2-GFP fusion protein for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and then analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences). The HPV16 L2-(25–45) fragment was subcloned between the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). The constructs were then transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the recommended protocol. Three days after transfection, the cells were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy (UltraView confocal imaging system, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). BPHE-1 cells were incubated with VLPs for 1 h at 4 °C in Dulbecco's PBS and then washed with medium at 37 °C. At the time points indicated, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.77 formaldehyde solution for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.17 (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and blocked with PBS containing 17 bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Monoclonal antibody H16.V5 was used at 1:100 dilution for detection of HPV16 L1, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was added at 5 ॖg/ml for 20 min at 4 °C. Actin was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin. Samples were examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse TE 200 inverted microscope equipped with a ×40 plan fluor or ×60 or ×100 plan apochromatic objective lens with a corresponding 1-, 0.8-, or 0.45-ॖm optical z-slice. Twelve bit images were merged and analyzed with the UltraView acquisition software, RGB mode. HPV16 VLPs were bound to BPHE-1 cells for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed; shifted to 37 °C for 15 min; and then fixed in 27 glutaraldehyde, 0.05 m sodium cacodylate, and 3 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. After fixation in 0.57 OsO4 and 0.87 potassium ferrocyanide in buffer for 15 min on ice, the cells were dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Eponate 12 (Ted Pella, Inc.) overnight. Samples were treated with 0.157 tannic acid for 1 min, rinsed, and then stained en bloc in uranyl acetate for 2 h in the dark. The sections were cut and examined with a Phillips CM120 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. HPV16 pseudovirions were generated, and their infectivity was assayed as described previously (22Roden R.B. Greenstone H.L. Kirnbauer R. Booy F.P. Jessie J. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5875-5883Google Scholar). The HPV16 L2Δ25–45 deletion mutant was prepared as described for the generation of HPV16 particles. The resulting DNA was inserted into the BamHI andXmaI restriction sites of pSFV4.2. To further define the role of L2 in the infectious process, we compared the binding, uptake, and intracellular transport of HPV16 VLPs containing both L1 and L2 (L1/L2 VLPs) with VLPs comprising only L1 (L1 VLPs) (27Kirnbauer R. Taub J. Greenstone H. Roden R. Durst M. Gissmann L. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6929-6936Google Scholar) in the permissive cell line BPHE-1 (29Zhang Y.L. Lewis Jr., A. Wade-Glass M. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2924-2928Google Scholar). HPV16 VLPs were incubated with BPHE-1 cells for 1 h at 4 °C and visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. As we previously demonstrated (20Roden R.B. Kirnbauer R. Jenson A.B. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7260-7266Google Scholar), VLPs comprising L1 and L2 or only L1 bound to cell surfaces with a similar pattern and degree (data not shown). Upon shifting to 37 °C for 15 min to initiate synchronized uptake, the cells were fixed, sectioned, and examined by transmission electron microscopy. No differences were noted in the cellular ultrastructure of plasma membrane-associated L1 VLPs (Fig. 1, A1 and A2) or L1/L2 VLPs (B1 and B2) or their engulfment by invagination of the plasma membrane (A2 and B2). At 30 min and 1, 2, and 6 h after shifting the BPHE-1 cells to 37 °C, the VLPs were localized (Fig.2) by indirect immunofluorescence using the HPV16 L1-specific, conformationally dependent, neutralizing monoclonal antibody H16.V5 (30Christensen N.D. Dillner J. Eklund C. Carter J.J. Wipf G.C. Reed C.A. Cladel N.M. Galloway D.A. Virology. 1996; 223: 174-184Google Scholar, 31Roden R.B. Armstrong A. Haderer P. Christensen N.D. Hubbert N.L. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. Kirnbauer R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6247-6252Google Scholar). Interestingly, L1/L2 VLPs aligned along distinct radial tracks across the cytoplasm and within ∼2 h at 37 °C arrived in the perinuclear region (Fig. 2, A1–A3). However, L1 VLPs were not aligned along such radial tracks. Rather, L1 VLPs remained widely distributed throughout the whole cell and showed a less clear-cut tropism toward the nucleus during this 6-h time course (Fig. 2, B1–B3). These differences in the uptake of L1/L2 and L1 VLPs suggest that L2 contributes to the transport of virions across the cytoplasm.Figure 2L2 promotes rapid transport across the cytoplasm and radial distribution of VLPs.Subconfluent BPHE-1 cells were incubated with 10 ॖg of HPV16 VLPs comprising L1/L2 (A panels), L1 alone (B panels), or L1 and L2 lacking residues 25–45 (C panels) for 1 h at 4 °C and then shifted to 37 °C for various times. The cells were fixed at 30 min (A1–C1), 1 h (A2–C2), and 2 h (A3–C3), respectively, with 3.77 formaldehyde solution for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.17 (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and blocked with PBS containing 17 bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Murine monoclonal antibody H16.V5 was used at 1:100 dilution for detection of HPV16 L1, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (green) was added at 5 ॖg/ml for 20 min at 4 °C. Actin was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (red). Samples were examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy (UltraView confocal imaging system). D, cytochalasin B at 10 ॖmdepolymerizes actin and prevents the uptake of L1/L2 VLPs into cells; E, actins in a normal BPHE-1 cell; F, localization of ॆ-tubulin (red) and L1 VLPs (green) at 2 h after shifting to physiologic temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the cytoskeleton provides a framework for intracellular transport and L1/L2 VLPs exhibited a radial distribution (Fig. 2,A1 and A2) during transit to the perinuclear region, we determined the subcellular localization of cytoskeletal components during VLP uptake. Furthermore, Liu et al. (32Liu W.J. Qi Y.M. Zhao K.N. Liu Y.H. Liu X.S. Frazer I.H. Virology. 2001; 282: 237-244Google Scholar) observed an interaction between L1 and tubulin, as well as blockade of particle uptake by the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole. Thus, we examined the relative localization of HPV16 L1 VLPs and tubulin by immunofluorescent staining. However, limited overlap of L1 VLP and tubulin signals was noted 2 h after uptake (Fig.2F). Cytochalasin B both disrupted the microfilament network by depolymerizing actin (Fig. 2, compare D and E) and inhibited uptake of HPV16 L1 (data not shown) and L1/L2 (Fig.2D) VLPs, consistent with previous studies (33Zhou J. Gissmann L. Zentgraf H. Muller H. Picken M. Muller M. Virology. 1995; 214: 167-176Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the localization of actin (using rhodamine-phalloidin) and VLPs during their uptake. Upon their initial uptake, the VLPs colocalized with cortical actin at the periphery of the cell. At later time points, the radially distributed L1/L2 VLPs colocalized with actin filaments (Fig. 2A2), whereas little overlap was observed for L1 VLPs and actin (compare A and B panels). Thus, actin polymerization is critical early in VLP uptake, and the particles colocalize with actin microfilaments while traversing the cytoplasm. Although other viruses, including the structurally related SV40, induce the formation of actin comet tails (34Frischknecht F. Way M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 30-38Google Scholar), this phenomenon was not observed during HPV16 VLP uptake, suggesting a different mode of transport. BPV1 is frequently exploited in virologic studies because, unlike HPVs (35Meyers C. Frattini M.G. Hudson J.B. Laimins L.A. Science. 1992; 257: 971-973Google Scholar), BPV can be readily prepared in milligram quantities, and its infectivity can be readily assayed in vitro (36Dvoretzky I. Shober R. Chattopadhyay S.K. Lowy D.R. Virology. 1980; 103: 369-375Google Scholar). To identify cellular 舠targeting molecule(s)舡 recognized by L2, we generated in E. coli six His6-tagged polypeptides spanning residues 1–88, 45–173, 130–257, 216–340, 300–425, and 384–469 that together encompass the entire open reading frame of BPV1 L2 (26Roden R.B. Weissinger E.M. Henderson D.W. Booy F. Kirnbauer R. Mushinski J.F. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7570-7574Google Scholar). These polypeptides were each incubated with [35S]methionine/cysteine-radiolabeled SiHa cell lysates (data not shown) or HeLa cell lysates and immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody specific for their tag. BPV1 L2 residues 1–88 co-immunoprecipitated with a cellular protein of ∼43 kDa, whereas the other fragments, including the overlapping BPV1 L2 peptide comprising amino acids 45–173, did not (Fig.3A). This implies that residues 1–45 of L2 mediate binding to a 43-kDa cellular protein. Unlike the C-terminal sequence, the first ∼120 amino acids of L2 are well conserved among the >70 known papillomavirus genotypes. To examine whether the N-terminal domain of L2 derived from other papillomavirus genotypes is also able bind to this 43-kDa cellular protein, we next generated in E. coli a chimera comprising GST fused in-frame to amino acids 1–128 of HPV16 L2 and GFP to form GST-HPV16 L2-(1–128)-GFP. The purified fusion protein was incubated with [35S]methionine/cysteine-radiolabeled SiHa cell lysates and immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody to GFP. The GST-HPV16 L2-(1–128)-GFP (but not GST-GFP) fusion protein also bound to the 43-kDa cellular protein (Fig. 3B), showing that this interaction is conserved in two evolutionarily distant papillomavirus types, BPV1 and HPV16. When testing smaller N-terminal subfragments of HPV16 L2, only residues 25–45 co-immunoprecipitated with the 43-kDa cellular protein from detergent lysates of radiolabeled SiHa cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that this motif is sufficient for interaction. To determine the distribution of the cellular protein that interacts with the HPV16 L2-GFP fusion protein, we examined, by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4,A1.1–A1.4) and flow cytometry (A2.1–A2.4), the binding to detergent-permeabilized human cervical carcinoma-derived cell lines of GST-GFP chimeric proteins either with or without HPV16 L2 residues 1–128. Whereas the GST-GFP fusion protein failed to bind to SiHa cells, GFP fusion proteins containing either residues 1–128 or 25–45 of HPV16 L2 bound to a similar extent within the cytoplasm of the detergent-permeabilized SiHa cells (Fig. 4). To eliminate the possible effects of GST in the binding of the fusion protein to cells, the GST-HPV16 L2-GFP fusion proteins were digested with PreScission protease (Fig. 4B1, PreS.P) to release the GST tag (37Cordingley M.G.

Thus, the binding to SiHa cells of PreScission protease-digested (Fig. 4B3.2) and undigested (Fig. 4B3.4) GST-HPV16 L2-(25–45)-GFP fusion protein was compared. L2-GFP (but not GFP alone) bound to SiHa cells to a similar extent either with or without GST, indicating that neither GST nor GFP mediates binding. Flow cytometric analysis showed that HPV16 L2 residues 1–128 bound to both HPV-positive cervical carcinoma-derived cell lines HeLa (data not shown) and SiHa (Fig. 4A2.2) to a similar extent as the HPV-negative human cervical carcinoma-derived cell line C33A (Fig. 4A2.4), indicating that HPV16 L2 binds to a cytoplasmic component that is not derived from papillomavirus. To identity the 43-kDa cellular protein, a detergent lysate of SiHa cells was passed over a GST-HPV16 L2-(1–128)-GFP-coated column. After extensive washing, the proteins bound were eluted and visualized by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (data not shown). The 43-kDa protein band recovered was excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF analysis. This analysis resulted in the identification of 13 peptides whose protein sequences were all consistent with ॆ-actin (Fig. 5, A andB). Because peptides of L2 were used for the actin binding experiments, it is possible that the truncations resulted in exposure on a nonphysiologic cryptic epitope. To demonstrate interaction between full-length L2 and actin, a detergent lysate of HeLa cells was passed over glutathione-Sepharose beads precoated with GST fused to full-length HPV16 L2. The bound proteins were separated by electrophoresis and subjected to Western blot analysis using a mouse monoclonal antibody to ॆ-actin (Fig. 3D). Full-length HPV16 L2 and its fragments 1–128 and 25–45 bound to actin, whereas fragment 299–333 and the GFP control did not (Fig.3D). Thus, binding to actin is a property of full-length L2. It is unclear whether L2 binds directly to actin. Therefore, to address this question, purified GST-GFP fusion proteins containing HPV16 L2 residues 25–45 or, as a negative control, residues 299–333 were incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature with actin purified from rabbit muscle (A-2522, Sigma). Upon pull-down with glutathione-Sepharose, actin copurified with the GST-GFP fusion protein containing residues 25–45 (but not residues 299–333) of HPV16 L2 (Fig. 3E). This observation strongly supports the existence of a direct interaction between HPV16 L2 residues 25–45 and actin. Studies in other viral systems suggest that interaction with actin can facilitate the intracellular transport of viral particles and infection. Therefore, to address the biologic significance of the putative actin-binding domain in HPV16 L2, we compared the uptake of HPV16 VLPs comprising wild-type L1 alone, L1 and L2, and L1 and L2 with residues 25–45 deleted (L1/L2Δ25–45). Whereas wild-type HPV16 L1/L2 VLPs were rapidly transported to the perinuclear region along radial tracts (Fig.2A1), L1/L2 VLPs lacking residues 25–45 failed to align along radial tracts in the cytoplasm and did not reach the perinuclear region during a 6-h time course (Fig. 2, C1–C3). Rather, L1/L2Δ25–45 VLPs remained widely distributed throughout the cell as described for L1 VLPs (Fig. 2, B1–B3). Because papillomavirus exhibits a high particle to infectivity ratioin vitro (22Roden R.B. Greenstone H.L. Kirnbauer R. Booy F.P. Jessie J. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5875-5883Google Scholar), it is possible that the uptake of HPV16 VLPs shown in Fig. 1 does not represent the true infectious pathway. Therefore, to examine the significance of this interaction between L2 and ॆ-actin to the infectious process, we generated HPV16 pseudovirions lacking the conserved ॆ-actin-binding domain,viz. residues 25–45 (Fig.6A), and tested their infectivity using a previously described system. Briefly, the hamster fibroblast cell line BPHE-1 harbors 50–200 episomal copies of the bovine papillomavirus genome/cell (29Zhang Y.L. Lewis Jr., A. Wade-Glass M. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2924-2928Google Scholar), but it produces no virus because the L1 and L2 genes are not expressed. However, ectopic expression of HPV16 L1 and L2 in BPHE-1 cells via infection with recombinant defective Semliki Forest viruses results in the generation of infectious HPV16 pseudovirions containing the BPV genome within capsids formed of HPV16 L1 and L2 (22Roden R.B. Greenstone H.L. Kirnbauer R. Booy F.P. Jessie J. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5875-5883Google Scholar). Like native BPV1 virions, the infectivity of HPV16 {BPV1} pseudovirions can readily be quantified using the in vitro focal transformation of mouse C127 cells (36Dvoretzky I. Shober R. Chattopadhyay S.K. Lowy D.R. Virology. 1980; 103: 369-375Google Scholar). HPV16 pseudovirions lacking residues 25–45 of L2 showed dramatically reduced infectivity (Fig. 6), suggesting that interaction between L2 and ॆ-actin indeed plays a critical role in the infectious process of papillomavirus. Actin is one of most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells, and its role as a primary determinant of cell shape, cytoplasmic structure,"

We analyzed the rate of superoxide production of human breast carcinoma cells expressing a cytochromec-green fluorescent protein (cyt-c-GFP) fusion protein at the single-cell level during apoptosis. In cells treated with the proapoptotic agents staurosporine (3 μm) or tumor necrosis factor-α (100 ng/ml), the release of cyt-c-GFP was individually set for each cell, and the majority of the fusion protein was released in less than 10 min. Prior to the release of the fusion protein, cells demonstrated a constant rate of superoxide production determined with the probe hydroethidine. After the release was completed, the superoxide concentration increased rapidly to a level more than 3-fold above baseline. Treatment with the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk; 200 μm) did not alter the kinetics of the cyt-c-GFP release but significantly reduced superoxide concentration after the release of cyt-c-GFP. Interestingly, treatment with z-VAD-fmk also reduced the increase in superoxide concentration in response to menadione in the absence of mitochondrial cyt-c-GFP release. Mitochondrial depolarization with the protonophore carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone per se did not trigger cyt-c-GFP release or an increase in superoxide production.

Activation of executioner caspases 3, 6, and 7 is responsible for the majority of the biochemical and morphological changes during apoptosis.

Despite the importance of mitochondrial superoxide production for cell death execution during apoptosis, the relationship between mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and superoxide production have not yet been determined at the single-cell level. In the present study, we investigated superoxide production during apoptosis by confocal time-lapse imaging of human breast carcinoma cells expressing a cyt-c-green-fluorescent-protein (GFP) fusion protein (11Heiskanen K.M.

Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cycloheximide (CHX), carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), menadione, and embryo-tested paraffin oil were purchased from Sigma. Staurosporine (STS) and manganese tetrakis (4-benzoyl acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) were from Alexis (Grünberg, Germany). The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk) was purchased from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). Hydroethidine (HEt) and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Generation and characterization of human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells stably expressing a cytochrome c-green fluorescent protein (cyt-c-GFP) fusion protein have been described (18Luetjens C.M.

We have previously shown that cyt-c-GFP is imported into mitochondria and co-released with endogenous cyt-c after selective outer membrane permeabilization with digitonin. Subcellular fractionation experiments confirmed the concomitant release of endogenous cyt-c and cyt-c-GFP from mitochondria during apoptosis (18Luetjens C.M. Kogel D. Reimertz C. Dussmann H. Renz A.

Cyt-c-GFP and ethidium fluorescence were monitored using an inverted Olympus IX70 confocal microscope equipped with a 488-nm argon laser (Fluoview; Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). HEt is a nonfluorescent compound that is oxidized by superoxide to its fluorescent product Et (19Rothe G. Valet G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1990; 47: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), allowing a semiquantitative determination of superoxide production (12Luetjens C.M. Bui N.T. Sengpiel B. Munstermann G. Poppe M.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEt was used at an extracellular concentration of 1 μm. Measurement of ΔΨmwas performed after equilibration of MCF-7/cyt-c-GFP cells with 30 nm of the cationic, voltage-sensitive dye TMRM (21Ehrenberg B. Montana V. Wei M. Wuskell J. Loew L. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Fluorescence transmitted the first dichroic mirror above 505 nm, was divided with a second dichroic mirror at 550 nm, and detected after transmission of a 510–540-nm bandpass filter (GFP) or a 590-nm high pass emission filter (Et and TMRM). There was no Et or TMRM fluorescence detectable in the GFP channel. The cross-talk between the average pixel intensity of GFP in the Et or TMRM channel was also negligible. Fluorescence was detected from a 0.7-μm-thick confocal section (full width half-maximum). Horizontal resolution was 0.2 μm per pixel. Image data were obtained using Fluoview 2.0 software (Olympus) and Kalman-filtered from two scans (2.2 s/512 × 512 pixel) for each image. For time-lapse imaging, culture dishes were mounted onto the microscope stage that was equipped with a temperature-controlled inlay (HT200, Minitüb, Tiefenbach, Germany). In control experiments constant fluorescence values were monitored for 24 h in case of cyt-c-GFP. Et fluorescence increase with constant slope was detected for 4 h under control conditions. For induction of apoptosis, cells were incubated with 3 μm STS or 100 ng/ml TNF-α plus 1 μg/ml CHX (TNF-α/CHX). The medium was enriched with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and thoroughly mixed to ensure a proper distribution of the drugs. To prevent evaporation the media was covered with embryo-tested paraffin oil. The quantitative analysis of the fluorescence images was performed using UTHSCSA ImageToolprogram (University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, TX). After background subtraction the average fluorescence intensity per pixel was calculated. The release kinetics of cyt-c-GFP of individual cells are shown as S.D. of the average pixel intensities (22Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). A compartmentalized cyt-c-GFP fluorescence contributes to a high S.D. of the pixel intensities, and a homogenous distribution after release of cyt-c-GFP is represented by a drop in S.D. Et fluorescence kinetics of individual cells were fitted with linear regression, and the ratios of the slopes after and before the release of cyt-c-GFP or after and before addition of menadione were calculated. Control ratios were calculated from Et fluorescence slopes during incubation with 1 μm HEt from 120 to 180 min divided by slopes from 60 to 120 min in cells treated with vehicle. Under conditions of mitochondrial depolarization, mitochondrially generated Et may be released into the cytoplasm, resulting in an artificial fluorescence enhancement (23Budd S. Castilho R. Nicholls D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We therefore additionally quantified Et production of whole cell cultures using a previously described cell lysate assay (12Luetjens C.M. Bui N.T. Sengpiel B. Munstermann G. Poppe M. Krohn A.J. Bauerbach E. Krieglstein J. Prehn J.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5715-5723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data are given as means ± S.E. For statistical comparison, analysis of variance and subsequent Tukey test were employed (SPSS 10.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). p values smaller than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. MCF-7 cells stably expressing a cyt-c-GFP fusion protein were exposed to the protein kinase inhibitor STS (activation of the mitochondrial pathway) or to TNF-α/CHX (activation of death receptors). After 120 min, the culture medium was supplemented with 1 μm HEt. The kinetics of cyt-c-GFP release and HEt oxidation were monitored by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Control cells treated with vehicle demonstrated a constant rate of HEt oxidation in the absence of cyt-c-GFP release (Figs.1A and 2B). In cultures exposed to STS, individual cells released the cyt-c-GFP fusion protein at different time points after onset of the treatment (Fig. 1, B and C). The release was characterized by a sudden redistribution from a punctate, filamentous to a diffuse, homogeneously distributed GFP signal (Fig.1B) (18Luetjens C.M. Kogel D. Reimertz C. Dussmann H.

Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The cyt-c-GFP redistribution was indicated by a rapid (<10 min) decrease in the S.D. of the average GFP pixel intensity (Fig. 1C). Confocal imaging of the kinetics of cyt-c-GFP release and the rate of superoxide production demonstrated that the rate of HEt oxidation increased significantly after the release of the cyt-c-GFP fusion protein. Similar results were obtained in cells exposed to TNF-α/CHX (Fig.1D).Figure 2Depolarization of ΔΨm does not increase Etfluorescence.

Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), a process that has also been observed during the release of cyt-c-GFP (11Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.W. Ma J. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). ΔΨmdepolarization can lead to an artificial Et fluorescence enhancement when large amounts of mitochondrially generated Et are released into the cytosol (“unquenching” effect) (23Budd S. Castilho R. Nicholls D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To avoid this artifact, our study was performed using a low HEt concentration (1 μm). Under these conditions, rapid and complete mitochondrial depolarization with the protonophore FCCP (10 μm) did not result in an increased Et fluorescence signal, even after prolonged pre-exposure to HEt (Fig.2, A and B). Parallel measurements of TMRM uptake demonstrated that FCCP depolarized ΔΨm within minutes, but it did not lead to the release of cyt-c-GFP (Fig. 2, C and D). The above experiments also suggested that mitochondrial depolarizationper se was not sufficient to acutely trigger an increase in superoxide production. Indeed, even prolonged treatment with FCCP (10 μm) neither induced cyt-c-GFP release from mitochondria nor triggered the generation of superoxide (Fig. 2,E and F). A treatment with the SOD mimetic MnTBAP (100 μm) potently blocked the increase in superoxide production after STS-induced cyt-c-GFP release (Fig.3A). Interestingly, treatment with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not inhibit cyt-c-GFP release or alter its kinetics (18Luetjens C.M. Kogel D. Reimertz C. Dussmann H. Renz A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nieminen A.L. Poppe M. Prehn J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but also potently inhibited the increase in superoxide production after the cyt-c-GFP release (Fig. 3B). Quantification of the Et fluorescence slopes before and after the STS-induced cyt-c-GFP release demonstrated a significant, more than 3-fold slope increase. This increase was significantly reduced in STS- plus z-VAD-fmk-treated cells (Fig. 3C). Quantification of Et production of whole cell cultures treated for 6 h with 3 μm STS also showed a 21.5 ± 1.9% increase in Et fluorescence per μg of protein compared with vehicle-treated controls (p < 0.05; n = 12 and 10 cultures, respectively). Et fluorescence in whole cell lysates was significantly reduced in 3 μm STS- plus 200 μmz-VAD-fmk-treated cells to a level of 12.6 ± 1.5% above control (p < 0.05 compared with the STS treatment;n = 12 cultures). The level of Et production in these bulk analyses was significantly smaller than expected from the single-cell measurements, suggesting that not all cells had released cytochrome c or that superoxide production had ceased in severely damaged cells. Treatment with 100 μm menadione acutely increased the superoxide production of MCF-7/cyt-c-GFP cells in the absence of any detectable cyt-c-GFP release (Fig.4A). Surprisingly, cells pretreated with 200 μm z-VAD-fmk and then treated with menadione did not show such increase (Fig. 4B), again in the absence of any detectable changes in cyt-c-GFP redistribution. Quantification of the Et fluorescence slopes in individual cells before and after the addition of menadione confirmed the inhibitory effect of z-VAD-fmk quantitatively (Fig.4C). Activation of death receptors or activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is known to increase the production of reactive oxygen species, and this has been demonstrated both during TNF-α- and STS-induced apoptosis (8Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 9Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T.

Our data now demonstrate at the single-cell level that superoxide production during STS- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis starts directly after the mitochondrial release of soluble intermembrane proteins. We did not detect a significant increase in superoxide production prior to the cyt-c-GFP release, and the SOD mimetic MnTBAP did not alter the kinetics of STS-induced cyt-c-GFP release. These results suggest that superoxide anions do not significantly modulate the process of outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization during STS-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. However, the increase in superoxide production may well play an important role in mitochondrial transition pore opening (24Bernardi P. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Forte M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 112-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk inhibited the increase in superoxide production after STS-induced cyt-c-GFP release, suggesting that this was a caspase-dependent process. Since the increased superoxide during apoptosis is generated by the mitochondrial respiratory chain (10Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 12Luetjens C.M. Bui N.T. Sengpiel B. Munstermann G. Poppe M. Krohn A.J. Bauerbach E. Krieglstein J. Prehn J.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5715-5723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that caspases directly target mitochondrial proteins. However, mitochondrial inner membrane or matrix proteins have not yet been identified among the more than 250 caspase substrates known to date. Interestingly, z-VAD-fmk also inhibited superoxide production triggered by an acute administration of menadione. Menadione is a prototype of a redox cycling compound that is reduced by complex I of the respiratory chain and subsequently generates superoxide (25Cadenas E. Sies H. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1985; 23: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, release of cyt-c-GFP could not be detected in response to menadione, even in cells monitored up to 120 min after the addition of menadione. Cells also exhibited normal morphology, 2H. Düssmann, D. Kögel, M. Rehm, and J. H. M. Prehn, unpublished data. suggesting that apoptotic pathways were not activated. These results suggest that the widely used broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk also exerts direct or indirect antioxidative effects and that inhibition of caspase activation is not solely responsible for the effects of z-VAD-fmk on superoxide production during apoptosis. At least two separate processes may account for potential caspase-independent superoxide production after mitochondrial membrane permeabilization: (i) increased superoxide production due to reverse electron flow after the loss of cyt-c and (ii) decreased antioxidant defense capacity in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Cyt-c may function as a direct antioxidant in living cells (26Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). It is known that a large fraction of cyt-c does not participate in electron transport (27Cortese J.D. Voglino A.L. Hackenbrock C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and hence that cyt-cis present in excess in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Electron microscopy studies have indicated that the release of cyt-cduring apoptosis is a complete process, leading to a total depletion of cyt-c in affected mitochondria (28D'Herde K. De Prest B. Mussche S. Schotte P. Beyaert R. Coster R.V. Roels F. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that cyt-c is released specifically out of apoptotic cells prior to a loss of plasma membrane integrity (18Luetjens C.M. Kogel D. Reimertz C. Dussmann H. Renz A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nieminen A.L. Poppe M. Prehn J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Renz A. Berdel W. Kreuter M. Belka C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Blood. 2001; 98: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the loss of cyt-c out of apoptotic mitochondria or cells increases their oxidative stress burden. However, this view is challenged by a recent study performed in isolated mitochondria that suggests that increased superoxide production during apoptosis may be related to the cyt-c-linked electron transport activity rather than the direct radical scavenging activity of cyt-c (14Kushnareva Y.E. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A.Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Mitochondria that are energized with malate and glutamate have been shown to generate superoxide via the flavin mononucleotide group of complex I in response to inhibition of mitochondrial electron flow (14Kushnareva Y.E. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A.Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar,30Votyakova T. Reynolds I. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 31Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Superoxide generation due to reversed electron transport to complex I has been shown to be dependent on ΔΨm (30Votyakova T. Reynolds I. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Indeed, the qualitatively similar increase in superoxide generation of isolated mitochondria depleted of cyt-c compared with mitochondria treated with the complex I inhibitor rotenone, as well as its dependence on the NADH/NAD+ ratio, suggests that complex I is a primary site of superoxide production during apoptosis (14Kushnareva Y.E. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A.Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). However, in depolarized mitochondria superoxide is primarily generated via the ubiquinone in the inner mitochondrial membrane (30Votyakova T. Reynolds I. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar,32Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). ΔΨm depolarizes after the release of cyt-c or cyt-c-GFP (11Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.W. Ma J. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 13Mootha V.K. Wei M.C. Buttle K.F. Scorrano L. Panoutsakopoulou V. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J.

It is therefore possible that ubiquinone is also a major source of superoxide after mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Indeed, an electron paramagnetic resonance study performed in digitonin-permeabilized mitochondria has demonstrated that ubiquinone autoxidation at the outer site of the complex III ubiquinone pool increases superoxide formation toward the intermembrane space (34Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that increased superoxide production and hence the activation of additional cell death pathways starts immediately after mitochondrial membrane permeabilization during STS- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis. The increase in superoxide production was sensitive to the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. However our data also indicate that this commonly used inhibitor may exert antioxidant activities unrelated to caspase inhibition.

Pharm. News. 2001; 8: 12-17Google Scholar). Although there are several families of voltage-gated potassium channels, they share a common structure comprising four α-subunits, each of which contains six transmembrane-spanning segments, S1–S6, with intracellular N and C termini (2Packer J. Conley E. Castle N. Wray D. January C. Patmore L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21 (poster insert): 327-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The activation of these channels in response to depolarization occurs via movement of the S4 region together with secondary movements of the S2 and S3 regions (e.g. Refs. 3Bezanilla F. J. Gen.

In the N-terminal intracellular region, the Kv channels also have a “tetramerization” T1 domain, the three-dimensional structure of which has been determined (7Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Stevens C.F.

The Kv2.1 potassium channel is a member of the Shab subfamily of voltage-operated channels and displays outward rectification together with little inactivation, at least on a millisecond time scale. The human and rat forms of the Kv2.1 channel have identical amino acids over the core membrane-spanning regions but differ only in the N- and C-terminal intracellular regions (20Albrecht B. Lorra C. Stocker M. Pongs O. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 99-110PubMed Google Scholar, 21Frech G.C. VanDongen A.M. Schuster G. Brown A.M. Joho R.H. Nature. 1989; 340: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, these two channels show markedly different activation kinetics; human Kv2.1 is much more slowly activating than rat Kv2.1. This implies a role of the N- and C-terminal regions in the activation process, and, indeed, large deletions of these terminal regions in rat Kv2.1 can affect activation kinetics (22VanDongen A.M. Frech G.C. Drewe J.A. Joho R.H. Brown A.M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 433-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Pascual J.M. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1849-C1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have located the molecular domains that underlie the differences in activation kinetics between the rat and human channels. For this, we have made mutations of the two amino acids that are different at the N-terminal region and we have also made chimeras between the two channels at the C-terminal region where there are 49 amino acids that differ between the two channels. Mutants were expressed in oocytes, and electrophysiological measurements were made by voltage clamping. Together with binding studies using glutathione S-transferase (GST)1 fusion proteins, we show that specific interactions between N and C termini affect the gating process. The human Kv2.1 clone in pGEMHE was provided by O. Pongs, Hamburg, Germany, and the rat Kv2.1 clone in pBluescript SK− was provided by A. M. Brown, Cleveland, OH. The mutants Q67E,E75D in rKv2.1 and E67Q,D75E in hKv2.1 were generated by a PCR method (QuikChange, Stratagene) using PfuTurbopolymerase enzyme (Stratagene) together with appropriate primers. 18 cycles were carried out, each cycle consisting of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min/kb at 68 °C. Products were digested with DpnI (Sigma). The hKv2.1 sequence has an ATG 12 bases before the assumed start methionine in rat and human Kv2.1. This ATG was mutated to ATA, again by the QuikChange method. Chimeric channels between rat Kv2.1 and human Kv2.1 were produced using either appropriate restriction enzyme digestion and subsequent ligation or the PCR overlap extension method. For restriction digestion and ligation, joins were made at the sites cut by the enzymesBssHII (Promega), Bsp1407I,Bsu36I, BsmI, and NotI (Fermentas) with ligation using T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas). Silent mutations were made (QuikChange) to introduce a Bsu36I site into rKv2.1 and a BsmI site into hKv2.1 at corresponding positions to the sites in hKv2.1 and rKv2.1, respectively. For the overlap extension method, first round PCR fragments were generated using appropriate primers and PfuTurbo polymerase (25 cycles, 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min/kb at 72 °C, plus 1 cycle, 10 min at 72 °C). Second round PCR was carried out using these fragments together with appropriate primers and the same PCR protocol. The PCR products were then digested with Bsp1407I and NotI and ligated into the similarly restricted wild type rKv2.1 in pBluescript, using T4 ligase. All mutants and chimeras were confirmed by automatic dideoxy sequencing. After linearization withNotI, capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro using the T7 promoter (Ambion MEGASCRIPT). For GST fusion protein studies, an N-terminal construct of the rat Kv2.1 channel (from the second amino acid to residue 181, just before S1) was subcloned in-frame into the pGex-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). For this, a corresponding N-terminal PCR product was obtained using sense and antisense primers with EcoRI and XhoI (plus stop codon) overhangs respectively and subcloned into the vector using these enzymes. For in vitrotranscription-translation under the T7 promoter, a C-terminal construct of the rat Kv2.1 channel (from just after S6 at residue 413 to the end) was obtained by deleting amino acids 1–412 from the rat Kv2.1 channel in pBluescript SK−. For this, a corresponding PCR product was obtained using a sense primer with an EcoRI overhang and a downstream primer without overhang. The PCR product was digested withEcoRI and Bsp1407I (the latter restriction site is native to the sequence), ligated back into rKv2.1 in pBluescript, and digested with the same enzymes. The N-terminal GST fusion construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). Large scale cultures were grown for 5 h, induced with 0.25 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and grown for a further 90 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by freeze/thaw, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The35S-labeled, C-terminal protein was synthesized using the reticulocyte lysate TnT T7 coupled transcription translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol.In vitro binding assays were carried out by adding 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) (50% slurry) to 1 ml of N-terminal GST fusion lysate. Tubes were incubated at room temperature for 45 min and washed three times with 100 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline. 20 μl of the C-terminal35S-labeled protein product was then added, and the samples were incubated for a further 45 min at room temperature. The samples were again washed three times, the GST fusion protein was eluted from the beads using 10 μl of elution buffer per sample (Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Xenopus oocytes were prepared and injected with 50 nl of wild type, mutant, or chimera RNA (5 ng for constructs in pBluescript, 0.5 ng for those in pGEMHE), and two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were made at room temperature (22 °C) as described previously (6Milligan C.J. Wray D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1852-1861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Oocytes were held in a 50-μl chamber and continually perfused (2 ml/min) with Ringer's solution (115 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). To obtain current-voltage (IV) curves, the membrane potential was held at −80 mV, and 500-ms duration test depolarizations at 0.1 Hz were applied in 10 mV increments from −70 mV to +70 mV. All currents were leak-subtracted by using twenty 10 mV hyperpolarizing steps (500 ms, 0.1 Hz). Activation times were taken as the time for currents to rise from 10–90% of maximum. Where possible, data were obtained for mutants/chimeras together with both wild types in the same batch to control for variations between batches of oocytes. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E., and Student's t test was used to test statistical significance. We first compared the properties of wild type rat and human Kv2.1 channels expressed in oocytes using two-electrode voltage-clamping. As found previously (20Albrecht B. Lorra C. Stocker M. Pongs O. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 99-110PubMed Google Scholar, 21Frech G.C. VanDongen A.M. Schuster G. Brown A.M. Joho R.H. Nature. 1989; 340: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), currents were outwardly rectifying, with little inactivation during 500-ms pulses (Fig. 1, A and B). For the IV curves, there were no significant differences between currents for the rat and human wild type channels at all test potentials studied (Fig. 1D). The activation times were significantly faster for the rat channel than for the human channel at all test potentials studied (Fig. 1, C and E), which was in agreement with earlier comparisons (20Albrecht B. Lorra C. Stocker M. Pongs O. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 99-110PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence differences between rat and human Kv2.1 channels are shown schematically in Fig. 1F, and the aim of this paper is to investigate the role of these amino acid differences in determining activation times. The human Kv2.1 sequence (but not the rat Kv2.1 sequence) has an ATG located 12 bases before the assumed start methionine. In principle, a start of translation at this ATG could also underlie the slower activation of hKv2.1. However, mutation of this ATG to ATA did not affect the activation kinetics (data not shown), suggesting that this preceding ATG has no functional role, and, indeed, it was not preceded by a Kozac sequence in the vector. To investigate the roles of the two N-terminal amino acids that differ between rat and human channels (Fig. 1F), these two residues were mutated in the rat channel to those in the human. These mutations in rat Kv2.1 (i.e. Q67E, E75D, and Q67E/E75D) were expressed in oocytes, and currents were recorded under voltage clamp. The IV curves for the mutants were not significantly different from those for rat wild type (data not shown), as would indeed have been expected, because the wild type IV curves themselves did not differ between rat and human (see above). Mutation Q67E in the rat channel caused a slowing of activation at all test potentials as compared with rat wild type (Fig. 2A), and, in fact, the activation times were not significantly different from those for the human wild type channel. On the other hand, mutation E75D in the rat channel did not affect activation times, which remained fast (Fig.2B). The double mutant rKv2.1 Q67E/E75D showed slow activation as in the human channel. These results suggest that, for the rat channel (i.e. in the context of the rat C terminus), residue 75 did not affect activation, whereas residue 67 of the N terminus must be Gln (rather than Glu) for activation kinetics to be fast. Experiments were also carried out on the human Kv2.1 channel, this time mutating the two residues at 67 and 75 to the corresponding rat residues (i.e. E67Q, D75E, and E67Q/D75E). Again, IV curves were not affected by these mutations (data not shown). Mutation E67Q in the human channel did not affect activation times as compared with human wild type (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, mutation D75E in the human channel was characterized by faster activation than in the wild type human channel and, in fact, was not significantly different from that for the rat channel (Fig.3B). The double mutant E67Q/D75E showed similar slow activation times as for human wild type (Fig. 3C). These results imply that, for the human channel (i.e. in the context of the human C terminus), residues 67 and 75 must both be Glu for the activation to be fast. At first glance, these results appear surprising and contradictory to those reported above with the rat channel (i.e. rat C terminus); indeed, only the combinations Gln67-Glu75-rC, Gln67-Asp75-rC, and Glu67-Glu75-hC (with rC and hC denoting the rat and human C-terminal regions, respectively) lead to channels with fast activation times. The most obvious explanation is that the C terminus is also involved in determining activation times and interacts with these N-terminal residues, albeit in a complex way. Thus the nature of the C terminus also determines the functional effects of mutations in the N terminus. To explore further the possible roles in activation kinetics of the 49 amino acids that differ in the C terminus between rat and human Kv2.1 (Fig. 1F), chimeras were made between the two channels and expressed in oocytes. Again, consistent with the lack of difference between IV curves for rat and human wild types, the IV curves for all the chimeras described in this section were not significantly different (data not shown) from wild type IV curves (except for one chimera wherein only very small differences were seen). Experiments were first carried out in the context of the rat channel N terminus. Replacing C-terminal amino acids 108 to 528 of the rat channel with corresponding human sequence (chimera I) did not change the activation time as compared with rat wild type (Fig.4A). Because of the near identity of the two channels, this in fact corresponds to swapping only the four amino acids that are different between the two channels at the C terminus (see Fig. 4D for diagrammatic representation). The data indicate that these residues are not involved in determining differences in activation time between the two channels. Replacing residues 529 to 740 in the rat channel with the human sequence (chimera II) also did not change the activation time (Fig. 4B). In this region, 30 amino acids are different between the two channels (again shown schematically in Fig. 4D), so the data suggest that these residues are also not involved in determining differences in activation times between the two channels. To confirm this, the entire region from residue 108 to 740 was swapped from human into rat channel (chimera III) and, as expected, the activation time was not significantly different from rat wild type. Therefore, none of the residues in the region 108–740 contribute to differences in activation time between the two channels (at least in the context of the rat N terminus). To investigate whether residues from 741 to 853 at the C terminus are involved, we constructed chimera IV with these residues in the rat replaced by their corresponding residues in human. This stretch comprises 15 amino acids that are different between the two channels (Fig. 5D). For this chimera, the activation time was slower than for rat and, in fact, not significantly different from that for human (Fig. 5A). This indicates that amino acids in this region determine differences in activation kinetics between the two channels. In confirmation of this, chimeras V and VI, which also include this region, likewise showed slow activation times similar to human wild type (Fig. 5, B and C). Therefore, taken together, the data show that up to 15 residues that are different in the domain 741–853 determine differences in activation times between the two channels (again in the context of the rat N terminus). We refer to this region as the C-terminal activation or CTA domain. In an attempt to further narrow down this domain, we made chimeras VII and VIII, which subdivide the swapped CTA domain into two subdomains (741–795 and 796–853, Fig.6C). However, activation times for both these chimeras remained fast, like rat wild type (Fig. 6,A and B). In combination with the previous results for chimeras IV to VI, the data therefore suggest that there are residues in both subdomains (i.e. 741–795 and 796–853) that are involved in determining differences in activation times between the two channels. More precisely (also taking into account the numbers of residues that are different in each domain), the data show that from 1 to 5 residues are involved in 741–795, and from 1 to 10 residues are involved in 796–853. Further experiments were also carried out in the context of the human N terminus while making chimeras in the C-terminal regions with the rat channel. In chimera IX, we replaced residues 529–853 of the human channel with the corresponding rat residues. For this chimera, the activation times were slow, as in the human wild type channel (Fig.6D). This is consistent with our previous results for the rat N-terminal double mutant (Q67E/E75D), because the C-terminal CTA domain of chimera IX is rat type, whereas the N-terminal residues are Glu67 and Asp75, just as in the rat double mutant Q67E/E75D (Fig. 2C), which is also slowly activating. Finally, we constructed chimera X with residues 108–740 of the human sequence replaced by rat channel residues. This was also slowly activating, as for the human wild type (Fig. 6E). This again can be understood in terms of our earlier results, because chimera X contains the human C-terminal CTA domain together with N-terminal residues Glu67 and Asp75, as for the human wild type itself, which was also slow. It is noteworthy that none of the mutations and chimeras (whether at the N or C terminus) affected the voltage dependence of the activation times (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) in the sense that the voltage dependence was either the same as that for human or rat wild type channels. In summary, the data, taken together, indicate that residues 67 and 75 at the N terminus and some residues within 741–853 at the C terminus are involved in determining activation kinetics. The data furthermore suggest an interaction between the N and C termini in determining activation kinetics. The most likely model for interaction between the N and C termini is by a direct binding between these two regions in the channel. To investigate this further, we carried out binding studies between these regions of the channel. For this, we examined binding of the C terminus (from S6 to the end) to a GST-N terminus fusion protein (from the second residue to S1). We first expressed the C-terminal protein as a 35S-labeled protein using an in vitro reticulocyte lysate system. This radiolabeled product was readily detected by autoradiography on SDS-PAGE gels (left lane in Fig.7A,Kv2.1-C), and the 35S-labeled C terminus product was indeed expressed at approximately the expected size. Next, the GST-N-terminal fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified with glutathione. This GST fusion protein was then exposed to the above 35S-labeled C-terminal protein, and any unbound protein was washed off while retaining the GST fusion protein (as well as any protein that had bound to it). This GST-N-terminal protein, together with any bound protein, was also run on SDS-PAGE gels and examined by autoradiography for any35S-labeled product (which must have come from bound labeled C terminus). This is shown in the middle lane in Fig. 7A (Kv2.1-N), and it can be seen that a 35S-labeled band was indeed detected in this lane (albeit weakly) at the same size as the C terminus product, indicating binding of the C terminus with the GST-N terminus fusion protein. The right lane in Fig. 7A(GST) was obtained like the middle lane, except that GST was used instead of the GST-N-terminal fusion protein. No band was seen in this control lane, indicating that the C terminus protein did not bind to GST itself. Taken together, the data therefore confirm that the N and C termini can indeed bind to each other. In this study, we have investigated the underlying molecular regions in the N- and C-terminal regions of the Kv2.1 potassium channel that are responsible for the marked differences in activation time between rat and human channels. At the N terminus, residues 67 and 75 were important in determining activation rate, whereas at the C terminus some residues within 741–853 (CTA domain) also determined activation rate. The data suggested interaction between N and C termini, because effects on either terminus depended on the nature of the (mutated) residues in the other terminal region. Furthermore, direct evidence for an interaction between the N and C termini was obtained using binding studies with GST fusion proteins. Although effects on the activation rate at the N terminus were localized to just two amino acids, at the C terminus two or more amino acids were involved. For the latter region (741–853) there are 15 amino acids, spanning residues 749–838, that are different between the two channels. Attempts to further narrow down this region indicated that 1–5 residues are involved in the subdomain 749–795, as well as 1–10 residues in the subdomain 796–838. The N-terminal residues 67 and 75 are located in the T1 domain of Kv2.1. Although the three-dimensional structure for the Kv2.1 T1 domain is not available, three-dimensional structures are available for the closely related channels Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv3.1 (7Kreusch A.

Miller C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1122-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Kobertz W.R. Williams C. Miller C.

Structure. 2001; 9: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To pursue this further, we have used computer-based homology modeling for the Kv2.1 T1 domain (Fig.7B). Residues 67 and 75 are apparently located at exposed positions on the outside of the T1 tetramer, with residue 67 at the lower part of the exposed side and residue 75 underneath in the “stirrup.” Using the same homology-based model, which includes energy minimization, it can be seen that a marked local change is produced by mutation between Gln and Glu at position 67; the region moves outward, probably repelled by neighboring negative charges. Although there is no such alteration for Asp and Glu mutations at residue 75, there is obviously a change in bulk for this residue. Of course, this is only a computer model, but it does illustrate the kind of changes that might occur. Mutation of these residues cannot change activation rate by interacting directly with the S4 region or its nearby intracellular loops, because neither residue faces the membrane. On the contrary, our data suggest instead that residues 67 and 75 may interact with the CTA domain that we have identified in the C-terminal region. The conclusion from our data of interactions between N and C termini is supported by earlier reports. For instance, deletions of the N terminus (139 residues) caused slowing of activation time in rKv2.1, but the activation times were speeded up (almost back to normal) by the further deletion of 318 residues from the C terminus (22VanDongen A.M. Frech G.C. Drewe J.A. Joho R.H. Brown A.M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 433-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). On the other hand, deleting these C-terminal residues in channels with an intact N terminus did not affect activation kinetics. Thus, the activation kinetics depend on interactions between N and C termini. Also, in our earlier work (24Wilson G.G. O'Neill C.A. Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Wray D. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 428: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) we have shown that phosphorylation of the rKv2.1 channel by protein kinase A takes place at the C terminus, but the extent of phosphorylation is influenced by the presence or absence of the N terminus, even though phosphorylation does not occur on the N terminus. Furthermore, under oxidizing conditions, a disulphide bond can form between an N-terminal cysteine (located just below the T1 tetrameric structure) and a C-terminal cysteine (26 residues from S6) in Kv1.1, indicating that these residues are, or can be, in the vicinity of each other (25Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that, on leaving S6, the polypeptide chain leads directly to the underside of T1. Further support for an interaction between N and C termini comes from the electron microscope structure (19Sokolova O. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Grigorieff N. Structure. 2001; 9: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) of the Kv1.1 channel, where it seems that the hanging gondola structure occupies a greater volume than T1 alone and, presumably, the remaining space is taken up by the C terminus, which seems to envelop it. Contact between the T1 region and the C terminus has also been hypothesized on the basis of the hydrophobicity of the outer surface of the T1 tetramer (11Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region in Kv2 channels can be divided into three separate domains, i.e. an S6 linker region (∼50 amino acids), a “Kv2” domain (Pfam 3521, ∼250 amino acids), and the CTA domain (∼110 amino acids) (Fig. 1F). The S6-Kv2 linker region shows considerable homology between Kv2 channels and has a computer-predicted helix-strand-helix structure. This linker may, together with the T1-S1 linkers, form the “ropes” that suspend the gondola and, by analogy with Kv1 (see above), may reach the underside of the gondola (Fig. 7C). The Kv2 domain is characteristic of the Kv2 channels and also shows some predicted secondary structure as well as some hydrophobic regions and may also contact the T1 region. The CTA domain that we have identified shows partial homology across the Kv2 family (Fig. 7D) and is predicted to possess several β-strands as well as some hydrophobic parts, and it may form a structure that interacts with T1 around residues 67 and 75, as has already been suggested in the present paper (Fig. 7C). Although the role of the Kv2.1 C terminus has not previously been systematically studied (except for deletion studies), the role of the N-terminal T1 domain has been well characterized. Besides the T1 deletions that cause slowing of activation (22VanDongen A.M. Frech G.C. Drewe J.A. Joho R.H. Brown A.M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 433-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Pascual J.M. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1849-C1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), various mutations within the T1 domain have also been shown to cause changes in activation kinetics as well as shifting IV curves (10Cushman S.J.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Some of these mutations have been located at the interface regions within the T1 tetramer, apparently without disrupting its structure, and the conclusion has been made that the conformational change of gating involves movement of both the membrane-gating machinery and the T1 region as a whole. Our data suggest the C terminus might also be involved in this conformational change within the model of a hanging gondola composed of a T1 core and an interacting C terminus (Fig.7C). Deletion of the core T1 region might leave the C terminus waggling in the wind, which may affect gating via its direct connection to S6 and the pore that it lines. Indeed, alterations of the T1 region may in fact mainly affect gating via its interaction with C-terminal protein, particularly for Kv2 channels with their very large C-terminal region. Obviously these possibilities remain the subject for further experimental testing. It had previously been thought that the voltage dependence of activation was different between rat and human Kv2.1 channels based on studies in different laboratories under different experimental conditions (20Albrecht B. Lorra C. Stocker M. Pongs O. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 99-110PubMed Google Scholar, 21Frech G.C. VanDongen A.M. Schuster G. Brown A.M. Joho R.H. Nature. 1989; 340: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, our results showing identical IV curves for the two channels under the same experimental conditions have shown that, in fact, the voltage dependence of steady-state activation is identical between the two channels. Thus, one might suggest that the extent of S4 movement and the stability of the open and closed states are probably not altered between these channels. However, the kinetics of S4 movement and/or the kinetics of intervening steps that lead to opening may be different between rat and human channels, leading to differing activation kinetics. Our experiments suggested a voltage-independent mechanism. Comparison with N-terminal deletion and cysteine binding experiments suggests that the slowing of activation that we have observed might be due to delayed first latency of opening by interfering with transitions in the activation pathway before first opening of single channels (23Pascual J.M. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1849-C1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is worth mentioning that interactions between the N and C termini are not confined to Kv channels like Kv2.1. Thus, for instance, interactions between these intracellular regions have been implicated for ether-a-go-go channels, plant KAT channels, and inward rectifier Kir channels (27Aydar E. Palmer C. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Marten I. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3448-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Jones P.A. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It may well be that such interactions generally form an intimate part of channel-gating machinery. Regarding physiological relevance of our results, Kv2.1 channels are widely expressed in a range of tissues, including brain (cell bodies and dendrites), heart, skeletal muscle, retina, cochlea, eye, germ cells, lung, pulmonary arteries, and pancreatic β cells (30Catterall W.A. Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. IUPHAR Compendium of Voltage-gated Ion Channels. IUPHAR Media, Leeds, UK2002: 86-87Google Scholar). The physiological function of the channel appears to be concerned with maintaining membrane potential and in modulating electrical excitability in neurones and muscle. In particular, in the brain where expression of the Kv2.1 channel is marked, the channel may play an important role in the control of synchrony, burst firing, and oscillations. Indeed the time scale of activation of these channels (tens of milliseconds) is appropriate to influence such dynamically occurring processes. It is tempting to speculate that the marked difference in activation time for Kv2.1 between rat and human (60 and 120 ms, respectively, at 0mV) might contribute physiologically to differences in dynamic firing patterns between rat and human. In conclusion, our results for Kv2.1 show that residues 67 and 75 in the T1 domain, as well as some residues within the CTA domain (741–853) at the C terminus, affect activation kinetics and that these regions interact. The T1 domain might affect channel activation kinetics via its connection with the C-terminal region and, hence, from there to S6 and its associated pore."

Virol. 1999; 73: 4485-4488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is evidence suggesting that the zinc fingers are needed to help form a functional initiation complex that promotes efficient (−) SSDNA synthesis (38Rong L. Liang C. Hsu M. Guo X.

The importance of cis-acting elements in viral RNA for efficient (−) SSDNA synthesis was first demonstrated in studies with Rous sarcoma virus indicating that extended interactions between the U5-IR stem upstream of the PBS and the TΨC loop of tRNATrp enhance initiation of reverse transcription (40Aiyar A.

In the case of HIV-1, chemical and enzymatic probing revealed complex interactions between U5 sequences upstream of the PBS and the anticodon loop, the 3′ portion of the anticodon stem, and part of the variable loop of tRNA3Lys (9Isel C.

The extended interactions between the primer tRNA and template have been reported to be stabilized by post-transcriptional modification of tRNA3Lys (9Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25269-25272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to contribute to efficient initiation of (−) SSDNA synthesis and transition from the initiation to elongation mode (1Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that an interaction between the 5′ portion of the TΨC loop of tRNA3Lys and a conserved 8-nt sequence in U5, referred to as a primer activation signal, may facilitate initiation of (−) SSDNA synthesis (53Beerens N. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 54Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31247-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As yet, a possible role in initiation for cis-acting template sequences downstream of the PBS has not been completely clarified. Deletion of a 54-nt sequence immediately downstream of the PBS led to a loss in infectivity and a dramatic reduction in viral DNA synthesis (55Li X. Liang C. Quan Y. Chandok R. Laughrea M. Parniak M.A. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6003-6010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis of smaller deletions within the 54-nt region showed that certain mutations have a greater effect on infectivity (55Li X. Liang C. Quan Y. Chandok R. Laughrea M. Parniak M.A. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6003-6010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Liang C. Rong L. Russell R.S. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6251-6261Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and synthesis of (−) SSDNA in vivo(55Li X. Liang C. Quan Y. Chandok R. Laughrea M. Parniak M.A. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6003-6010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) than others. In vitro, however, the mutant RNA templates have similar activities but are less efficient than wild-type RNA in directing tRNA primer extension (4Liang C. Rong L. Götte M. Li X. Quan Y. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21309-21315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 56Liang C. Rong L. Russell R.S. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6251-6261Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In other in vitro work, it was reported that templates with mutations in downstream sequences that disrupt base pairing with the proposed primer activation signal, direct increased levels of (−) SSDNA synthesis, compared with a wild-type RNA template (53Beerens N. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 54Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31247-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the primer and template requirements for efficient synthesis of (−) SSDNA in vitro. We report that in the absence of NC, at least 24 bases immediately downstream of the PBS are required for efficient (−) SSDNA synthesis when RNA primers (native tRNA3Lys or an 18-nt RNA complementary to the PBS (R18)), but not an all DNA (D18) primer, are used. These findings, as well as results of assays with chimeric DNA-RNA primers, are correlated with CD spectra and melting studies of 18-nt primer:PBS duplexes, underscoring the important role of helical conformation and thermal stability for priming activity. The results also suggest that the presence of the 24 additional downstream bases in viral RNA may allow the template to assume a more favorable conformation for annealing to the RNA primers. Interestingly, HIV-1 NC abrogates the requirement for these additional bases if (−) SSDNA synthesis is primed by tRNA3Lys but not by R18. Mutational analysis supports the hypothesis that the nucleic acid chaperone activity of NC facilitates stable formation of extended interactions between the 3′ anticodon stem and variable loop of tRNA3Lys and bases upstream of the A-rich loop in the RNA template and that these interactions modulate initiation of reverse transcription. Ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides are indicated by upper and lowercase letters, respectively. D18 and R18 oligonucleotides (5′-gtccctgttcgggcgcca and 5′-GUCCCUGUUCGGGCGCCA, respectively) that are complementary to the HIV-1 PBS were purchased from Oligos Etc., Inc. (Wilsonville, OR). Three DNA-RNA chimeric oligonucleotide primers, R9D9, D9R9, and R17D1, were prepared by solid-phase synthesis on an Expedite 8909 RNA/DNA synthesizer using phosphoramidite monomers, and other chemicals purchased from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). The sequences were as follows: 5′-GUCCCUGUUcgggcgcca (R9D9); 5′-gtccctgttCGGGCGCCA (D9R9); and 5′-GUCCCUGUUCGGGCGCCa (R17D1). Purified tRNA3Lysfrom human placenta was obtained from Bio S&T (Lachine, Quebec, Canada). PCR primers and an 18-nt oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′ end of tRNA3Lys (5′-tggcgcccgaacagggac) were purchased from Lofstrand (Gaithersburg, MD). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. HIV-1 RT was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Lakewood, NJ). Calf intestinal phosphatase and Vent DNA polymerase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Recombinant wild-type HIV-1 NC (55-amino acid form) was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Gorelick and was prepared as described previously (57Wu W. Henderson L.E. Copeland T.D. Gorelick R.J. Bosche W.J. Rein A. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7132-7142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmid sequences were derived from the HIV-1 pNL4-3 clone (58Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pRUG, which was designed to provide the DNA templates for in vitro synthesis of viral RNA templates, was constructed from the previously described pJD plasmid (59Guo J. Henderson L.E. Bess J. Kane B. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pNL4-3 fragment from the SacI site (nt 491) in the repeat (R) region of the 5′ long terminal repeat to thePstI site (nt 1419) in the capsid coding region was inserted into the SacI and PstI sites of the pJD plasmid. Three mutations were made in pRUG, which result in modification of U5 sequences in the RNA transcribed from the mutant templates: pRUG mut (143–149), which changes nt 143–149 to their complementary bases; pRUG AloopU, which substitutes four U residues for the four A residues (nt 169–172) in the A-rich loop; and pRUG AloopU mut (143–149), containing the double mutation. For PCR amplification of fragments from plasmid pRUG, the forward primer (5′-ccaatgcttaatcagtgaggc), located at the start of the amp gene, 1459 nt upstream of the T7 promoter, was used. The reverse primers were as follows: pRUG mut (143–149), 5′-gtccctgttcgggcgccactgctagagattttccacactgactaaaagggtgact cccatctctagttacc; pRUG AloopU, 5′-gtccctgttcgggcgccactgctagagaaaaaccacactgactaaaagggtctgagggatctctagttacc; pRUG AloopU mut (143–149), 5′-gtccctgttcgggcgccactgctagagaaaaaccacactgactaaaagggtgactcccatctctagttacc. Each reverse primer has a NarI site starting 11 nt from the 5′ end (corresponding to nt 184–190 in the PBS region of the RNA); the vector also has a NarI site. The fragments were cut withNarI and inserted into NarI-digested pRUG. In all cases, the sequences of both the insert and the boundary regions were verified by DNA sequencing. To make the DNA templates forin vitro RNA transcription, the fragments containing both the T7 promoter and the desired length of viral RNA were amplified by PCR from plasmid pRUG or the three pRUG mutants, using Vent DNA polymerase. The forward primer (5′-ccaatgcttaatcagtgaggc) is located at the start of the amp gene. The reverse primers were as follows: RNA 200, 5′-gtccctgttcgggcgccact; RNA 210, 5′-tcgctttcaagtccctgttc; RNA 220, 5′-ggctttactttcgctttcaa; RNA 221, 5′-tggctttactttcgctttca; RNA 222, 5′-ctggctttactttcgctttc; RNA 223, 5′-tctggctttactttcgcttt; RNA 224, 5′-ctctggctttactttcgctt; RNA 226, 5′-tcctctggctttactttcgc; RNA 228, 5′-tctcctctggctttactttc; RNA 230, 5′-gatctcctctggctttactt; RNA 240, 5′-tgcgtcgagagatctcctct; RNA 244, 5′-gtcctgcgtcgagagatc; RNA 732, 5′-gtaattttggctgacctggc. The reverse primers for RNA 200 and RNA 244 could also be used to generate the corresponding mutant RNA templates. After PCR amplification, the DNA fragments were separated on 1.5% agarose gels and were extracted with a QIAEX II kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). To prepare the DNA template for synthesis of RNA 509, pRUG was linearized withAccI. RNA templates were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase, using an Ambion MEGAscript kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and were then purified by electrophoresis on a 2 or 3% agarose gel. RNA fragments of the appropriate size were extracted from the gel with an RNaid kit (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified RNA was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Note that the RNA templates are defined by the number of bases downstream of nt +1 in the viral RNA genome (see Fig.1B). The secondary structure of a portion of the 5′ leader region of HIV-1 NL4-3 RNA (see Fig. 1A) was predicted frommfold (60Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 11-43Crossref Google Scholar, 61Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The R18, R9D9, D9R9, and R17D1 primers were purified on denaturing 20% polyacrylamide-Tris-borate/EDTA (TBE) gels and were then eluted with an RNaid kit. All of the 18-nt primers were labeled at their 5′ ends with [γ-32P]ATP, as described previously (62Guo J. Wu W. Yuan Z.Y. Post K. Crouch R.J. Levin J.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5018-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To prepare 5′ 32P-labeled tRNA3Lys, the acceptor stem was first disrupted by annealing the 3′ end of the tRNA to an 18-nt DNA complementary oligonucleotide (see above); this increases the efficiency of labeling at the 5′ end of the tRNA. The tRNA was then dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase (1 unit/μg of tRNA3Lys) at 50 °C for 2 h prior to labeling. Following incubation with 0.2 units/μl of RNase-free DNase I (Ambion Inc.) for 30 min at 37 °C, the 76-nt tRNA was separated from other products by electrophoresis on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide-TBE gel and was then eluted and quantified, as described above under “Preparation of RNA Templates.” Unless specified otherwise, the template and primer were annealed with heat, and NC was not present in the reaction mixture. In these experiments, 0.2 pmol of the indicated RNA template was annealed to 0.1 pmol of the indicated32P-labeled primer (3–5 × 105 cpm) in 2 μl of buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 75 mm KCl at 65 °C for 5 min followed by gradual cooling to 37 °C. Where annealing was performed in the presence of HIV-1 NC, 0.2 pmol of the RNA template was annealed to 0.1 pmol of the 5′ labeled R18 primer (3–5 × 105 cpm) or to unlabeled tRNA3Lys in 7 μl of solution, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH"

Prohormone convertases belonging to the subtilisin family of serine proteases are primarily responsible for processing at these “classical sites.” In addition to the classical cleavages, a subset of bioactive peptides is generated by processing at “nonclassical” sites. The proteases responsible for these cleavages have not been well explored. Members of several metalloprotease families have been proposed to be involved in nonclassical processing. Among them, endothelin-converting enzyme-2 (ECE-2) is a good candidate because it exhibits a neuroendocrine distribution and an acidic pH optimum. To examine the involvement of this protease in neuropeptide processing, we purified the recombinant enzyme and characterized its catalytic activity. Purified ECE-2 efficiently processes big endothelin-1 to endothelin-1 by cleavage between Trp21 and Val22 at acidic pH. To characterize the substrate specificity of ECE-2, we used mass spectrometry with a panel of 42 peptides as substrates to identify the products. Only 10 of these 42 peptides were processed by ECE-2. A comparison of residues around the cleavage site revealed that ECE-2 exhibits a unique cleavage site selectivity that is related to but distinct from that of ECE-1. ECE-2 tolerates a wide range of amino acids in the P1-position and prefers aliphatic/aromatic residues in the P1′-position. However, only a small fraction of the aliphatic/aromatic amino acid-containing sites were cleaved, indicating that there are additional constraints beyond the P1- and P1′-positions. The enzyme is able to generate a number of biologically active peptides from peptide intermediates, suggesting an important role for this enzyme in the biosynthesis of regulatory peptides. Also, ECE-2 processes proenkephalin-derived bovine adrenal medulla peptides, and this processing leads to peptide products known to have differential receptor selectivity. Finally, ECE-2 processes PEN-LEN, an endogenous inhibitor of prohormone convertase 1, into products that do not inhibit the enzyme. Taken together, these results are consistent with an important role for ECE-2 in the processing of regulatory peptides at nonclassical sites.

Many of these proteins and peptides are intercellular messengers. Most neuroendocrine peptides are synthesized from precursor proteins. Post-translational processing of these precursors is a key step in the production of biologically active peptides. In the majority of cases, this occurs by proteolysis of the precursors at classical cleavage sites. These sites are usually multiple basic amino acids (1Docherty K. Steiner D.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1982; 44: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Several neuropeptide-processing enzymes have been identified in mammalian cells (2Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol.

Initially the precursor is cleaved by endoproteases of the subtilisin family of serine proteases, such as prohormone convertases (PCs)1 (for review, see Refs.2Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J.

Following endopeptidase activity, carboxypeptidases such as carboxypeptidase E (CPE, also called CPH) remove the basic amino acids from the C termini of peptides (6Fricker L.D. Fricker L.D. Peptide Biosynthesis and Processing. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 199-230Google Scholar). The peptides with C-terminal extended Gly residues are processed into C-terminal amidated peptides by peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (7Eipper B.A. Perkins S.N. Husten E.J. Johnson R.C.

All of these enzymes involved in the generation of regulatory peptides exhibit a restricted neuroendocrine distribution as well as subcellular localization to peptides containing secretory vesicles; furthermore, they are optimally active at pH 5–6 (2Zhou A.

These have been identified primarily by bulk purification from neuroendocrine tissues (10Sigafoos J. Chestnut W.G. Merrill B.M. Taylor L.C. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Viveros O.H. J.

Additionally, an examination of cleavage sites within the precursors for endogenous peptides showed that nonclassical processing is required to release the peptide from its precursor (13Perry S.J.

Finally, mass spectrometric techniques to identify neuropeptides in the brains of mice lacking specific processing enzymes such as CPE have led to the identification of products of nonclassical cleavages (16Che F.-Y.

Members of the metalloprotease family have been largely implicated in the processing of bioactive peptides at nonclassical sites (17Molineaux C. Wilk S. Fricker L.D. Peptide Biosynthesis and Processing. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 251-282Google Scholar). The majority of these proteases exhibit near neutral pH optima and a cellular and subcellular localization that is not consistent with a role for these enzymes in neuroendocrine peptide processing within the intracellular milieu (18Turner A.J. Isaac R.E. Coates D. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Among them ECE-1 exhibits a neutral pH optimum, a broad tissue distribution, and predominant cell surface expression (19Turner A.J. Murphy L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 20Ahn K. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 1085-1091Google Scholar). ECE-1 converts big endothelin (ET) to endothelin through cleavage at a Trp-Val (endothelin-1 and -2) or a Trp-Ile (endothelin-3) site (19Turner A.J. Murphy L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). ECE-2 was discovered in 1995 (21Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) as a novel member of the ECE-1 gene family; the two gene products share 59% amino acid identity (18Turner A.J. Isaac R.E. Coates D. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In contrast to ECE-1, ECE-2 is optimally active at pH 5.5 and localized to an intracellular compartment (21Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 22Yanagisawa H. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Emoto N. Williams S.C. Takeda S. Clouthier D.E.

A recent study examining the isoforms of ECE-2 has found that the ECE-2b isoform is highly expressed in neuroendocrine tissues (brain, pituitary, and adrenal medulla) and poorly expressed in other tissues (25Ikeda S. Emoto N. Alimsardjono H. Yokoyama M. Matsuo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These properties make ECE-2b an ideal candidate for intracellular processing of neuroendocrine precursors. Despite this, relatively little has been reported about the enzymatic properties of ECE-2b. Here we describe studies characterizing the biochemical and kinetic properties of ECE-2. Because this enzyme is a transmembrane protein, purification of this protein in sufficient quantities to allow comprehensive studies could be labor intensive and time consuming. This problem has been overcome in the case of many Zn2+metalloproteases, including ECE-1, through the expression of soluble secreted enzymes (26Fahnoe D.C. Johnson G.D. Herman S.B. Ahn K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Vickers C. Hales P. Kaushik V. Dick L. Gavin J. Tang J. Godbout K. Parsons T. Baronas E. Hsieh F. Acton S. Patane M.

This has enabled abundant expression and rapid purification of these enzymes (26Fahnoe D.C. Johnson G.D. Herman S.B. Ahn K. Arch. Biochem.

The resulting enzyme has been found to exhibit virtually identical biochemical properties as that of the endogenous enzyme (26Fahnoe D.C. Johnson G.D. Herman S.B. Ahn K. Arch. Biochem.

We used a similar strategy to produce and purify the soluble catalytic portion of ECE-2 that is common to all isoforms (ECE-2a1, -2a2, -2b1, and -2b2). In this study, we show that purified ECE-2 exhibits an acidic pH optimum and a unique cleavage site selectivity. Furthermore, we show that ECE-2 is able to generate biologically active peptides from known precursors. These results support a role for ECE-2 in the nonclassical processing of regulatory peptides. Big endothelin-1 (human, 1–38), substance P, neurotensin, [Arg8]vasopressin, joining peptide (bovine), β-endorphin (rat), dynorphin B (Dyn B), Dyn A, Dyn A-8, bovine adrenal medulla (BAM) peptide E, BAM 22, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (San Carlos, CA). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, rat), bradykinin, and BAM 18 were obtained from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Belmont, CA), and angiotensin I, II, and III were acquired from Sigma. Little PEN-LEN was synthesized by Invitrogen, internally quenched fluorescent substrate McaBk2 ((7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Ala-Phe-Lys-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)) was custom synthesized by Sigma-Genosys, and all other peptides were synthesized at the peptide synthesis facility at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. DEAE-Sepharose fast flow was obtained fromAmersham Biosciences AB (Uppsala, Sweden), TalonTMmetal affinity resin was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), and the C18 column reverse-phase column was acquired from Vydac (Hesperia, CA). To generate a secreted soluble form of ECE-2, the N-terminal transmembrane domain was removed and replaced with the signal peptide from rat CPE corresponding to amino acids 1–42. Following the CPE cDNA, we inserted an oligonucleotide encoding six His residues followed by human ECE-2 cDNA (corresponding to amino acids 81–766). The DNA fragment was cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392, and recombinant virus expression was carried out as described previously (28Mzhavia N. Berman Y. Qian Y. Yan L. Devi L.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells growing in Sf900-II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) were co-transfected with recombinant ECE-2 cDNA in pVL1392 and BaculoGold viral DNA (Pharmingen) using the calcium phosphate procedure. After culturing for 5 days, 100 μl of medium were used to infect 106 Sf9 cells in a 25-cm2 flask. Then 1 ml of the medium from this second infection was used to infect 108 Sf9 cells in 50 ml of medium growing in a shaker flask. After 3 days of infection, the medium was analyzed for the expression of enzyme activity. The medium was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 60 min, and the resulting supernatant was frozen at −80 °C until use. Approximately 300 ml of medium from 6 × 108Sf9 cells infected with ECE-2-expressing baculovirus was thawed and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. All subsequent operations were at 0–4 °C unless otherwise noted. The enzyme was concentrated by passing the medium through Amicon ultrafiltration membrane YM100 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). For purification, the concentrated material was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow anion exchange column in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.1 (Buffer A). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in Buffer A. The fractions were assayed for ECE-2 activity as described below and for protein levels using BCA reagent (Pierce). The peak of ECE-2 activity eluted around 0.25 m NaCl. Fractions containing the highest activity were pooled and loaded onto a TalonTM-Sepharose Co2+ affinity resin column equilibrated with Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.1, containing 300 mm NaCl. Previously we have found the Ni2+ affinity resin to be unsuitable for purification of ECE-2. The enzyme bound to Co2+ resin was washed with the sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and was eluted with the same buffer adjusted to pH 5.0. Fractions containing ECE-2 activity were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. McaBk2 was dissolved in 100% Me2SO, and the concentration of the peptide was determined spectrophotometrically with an extinction coefficient of 14,000m−1 cm−1. ECE-2 activity routinely was assayed with 10 μm McaBk2 in 0.2m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.01% detergent C12E8 (octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether, Calbiochem) unless indicated otherwise. For pH dependence studies, sodium citrate, Tris acetate, or sodium acetate buffers were used. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored on a Fluoromax plate reader with excitation at 320 nm and emission at 405 nm, and initial velocity was determined. Polyclonal antisera were custom generated against the C-terminal 16 amino acids of ECE-2; this sequence differs from the sequence of the C terminus of ECE-1. The fractions containing ECE-2 activity were analyzed by Western blotting as described (29Qian Y. Devi L.A. Mzhavia N. Munzer S. Seidah N.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23596-23601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using a 1:1000 dilution of antiserum. This antiserum is able to recognize the ∼100-kDa truncated ECE-2 secreted from baculovirus cells (Fig. 1B) as well as the 120-kDa form of endogenous ECE-2 (data not shown). The signal was blocked completely by the immunogenic peptide, suggesting that the antiserum is specific to ECE-2. Approximately 1 nmol of each peptide listed in TableII was incubated with purified ECE-2 in 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, at 37 °C. The reaction was carried out for various time periods and terminated by quick freezing. Peptides from samples were isolated using Zip-Tip hydrophobic chromatography columns and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry on a Perceptive Biosystems Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer as described (16Che F.-Y. Yan L. Li H. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Fricker L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9971-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Mzhavia N. Qian Y. Feng Y. Che F.-Y. Devi L.A. Fricker L.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 67-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 100 laser shots were summed per spectrum. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated in 30% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water was used as a matrix. External calibration was performed with [des-Arg1]bradykinin ((M + H)+ = 904.4681) and neurotensin ((M + H)+ = 1672.9170).Table IIHydrolysis of bioactive peptides by ECE-2: determination of cleavage sites by MALDI-TOF mass spectometryThe arrows represent primary cleavages and arrowheads represent secondary cleavages. Open table in a new tab The arrows represent primary cleavages and arrowheads represent secondary cleavages. Approximately 0.2–100 μmpeptides were incubated with 0.5–3 nm purified ECE-2 in 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.01% C12E8 (v/v) at 37 °C. Reactions were carried out for various times and quenched by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid of 0.1%. Prior to injection, the trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile concentrations of the sample were adjusted to 0.05 and 15%, respectively. The samples were loaded onto a C18column (0.46 × 15 cm) and eluted using a linear gradient of 15–65% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were detected by measuring absorbance at 215 nm. The initial rate of substrate hydrolysis (V0) was determined by measuring the appearance of product under initial rate conditions (less then 10% substrate hydrolysis). V0 values were plotted as a function of substrate concentration ([S]) and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism (version 2.0) software.kcat values were calculated using the equationkcat =Vmax/[E] with a subunit molar mass of 100 kDa. Identity of peptide peaks was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described (16Che F.-Y. Yan L. Li H. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Fricker L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9971-9976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Mzhavia N. Qian Y. Feng Y. Che F.-Y. Devi L.A. Fricker L.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 67-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate the biochemical characterization, we expressed ECE-2 as a soluble secreted protein in a eukaryotic expression system. For this, the transmembrane domain (including the N-terminal region) was removed from ECE-2b to enable expression as a soluble enzyme and replaced with the signal sequence and proregion of a secretory vesicle protein, CPE, to enable targeting of the recombinant enzyme to the secretory pathway. Thus the cDNA fragment encoding the entire luminal domain (that contains the catalytic region) of ECE-2b was fused in frame with the cDNA encoding the signal sequence and proregion of CPE; the resulting sequence consisted of residues 1–42 of CPE, six His residues, and residues 81–766 of ECE-2b. The secreted medium from cells infected with recombinant virus was subjected to purification using anion exchange and metal ion affinity chromatography. For the determination of ECE-2 activity, the intramolecularly quenched fluorescent peptide substrate McaBk2 was used (31Johnson G.D. Ahn K. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This reagent originally was developed as a substrate for ECE-1 and has 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl and dinitrophenyl as the donor and acceptor at the N and C termini, respectively. The substrate is readily hydrolyzable by ECE-2; this simple and fast assay proved to be ideal for the rapid purification and characterization of ECE-2. ECE-2 was purified ∼100-fold from the secreted medium (TableI). The level of purification was judged by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Fig.1A). Western blotting analysis with a polyclonal antiserum generated to the C-terminal 16-residue peptide shows enrichment of the ∼100-kDa band representing soluble recombinant ECE-2 (Fig. 1B). The purified ECE-2 exhibits an apparent Km of about 9 μm for the McaBk2 substrate.Table IPurification of ECE-2 activityPurification stepsTotal proteinTotal activityYieldSpecific activityPurificationmgμmol/min%μmol/min/mgFoldMedium43.802.191000.051.0Amicon YM1007.700.54250.071.4DEAE-Sepharose1.250.28130.224.4Talon affinity resin0.050.24114.7995.9 Open table in a new tab We characterized the purified ECE-2 activity by examining its pH optimum and sensitivity to divalent cations. Previous studies with crude ECE-2 (membranes from cells expressing recombinant ECE-2) showed that the enzyme was optimally active at pH 5.5 (21Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Our results with purified ECE-2 agree with this earlier observation in that the purified enzyme exhibits a sharp pH dependence (Fig.2A). The pH optimum is 5.0–5.5, and the enzyme has <20% of the maximal activity at pH 4.5 or 6.0 and is inactive at pH 6.5 (Fig.2A). This acidic pH optimum of ECE-2 contrasts with the near neutral pH optimum of ECE-1 (19Turner A.J. Murphy L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 20Ahn K. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.

These results are consistent with a role in peptide processing for ECE-1 in the extracellular milieu and for ECE-2 in the intracellular milieu. The sensitivity of ECE-2 to divalent ions was tested using ZnCl2, CoCl2, NiSO4, CuSO4, MnCl2, MgCl2, and CaCl2. ECE-2 is activated to a small but significant extent by Co2+ ions at all concentrations examined (Fig.2B). In response to Zn2+ and Cu2+, the enzyme exhibits a biphasic response in that low concentrations (up to 10 μm) activate and higher concentrations inhibit ECE-2 activity. Ni2+ ions inhibit the activity at all concentrations tested. Mn2+, Mg2+, or Ca2+ ions had no significant effect on ECE-2 activity. Taken together, these results support the involvement of metal ions at the active site. Next we examined 30 distinct peptides and a pool of 12 peptides that differ only in the penultimate position for their ability to serve as substrates of ECE-2 (Table II), and we identified the products by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig.3). Among the biologically active peptides that were previously found to be cleaved by other related metalloproteases, big ET-1 and bradykinin are cleaved, respectively, at sites Trp21-Val22 and Pro7-Phe8, which also are used by ECE-1 (31Johnson G.D. Ahn K. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,32Johnson G.D. Stvenson T. Ahn K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4053-4058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Interestingly, [des-Arg1]bradykinin is not cleaved even though the Pro7-Phe8 site is present in this peptide. This suggests that there is a minimum length requirement for cleavage by ECE-2 (discussed further below). Neurotensin, angiotensin I, and substance P are cleaved at sites (Pro10-Tyr11, Pro7-Phe8, and Gly9-Leu10, respectively) that also are cleaved by neprilysin. ECE-2 does not cleave luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, which has been shown to be cleaved by neprilysin and ECE-1, albeit less efficiently (32Johnson G.D. Stvenson T. Ahn K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4053-4058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of peptides, such as angiotensin II and III, [Arg]vasopressin, ACTH, and β-neoendorphin, that are hydrolyzed by other metalloproteases are not cleaved by ECE-2 (Table II), suggesting that this enzyme exhibits unique substrate specificity. Among the peptides derived from opioid peptide precursors, proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides (β-endorphin, ACTH, and J-peptide) are not cleaved by ECE-2 (Table II). In contrast, proenkephalin-derived peptides, namely peptide E, BAM 22, and BAM 18, were found to be good substrates for ECE-2 (Fig. 3 and Table II). The primary site of cleavage of peptide E is between Gly23 and Phe24 leading to the generation of BAM 23 (Fig. 3). Peptide E also is cleaved between Asp16 and Tyr17, albeit less efficiently, to generate BAM 16. Another proenkephalin A-derived peptide, BAM 22, also is cleaved by ECE-2 at a single site leading to the generation of BAM 12 (Table II). Finally, BAM 18 is cleaved by ECE-2 at Asp16-Tyr17"

Glucocorticoids exert their effects via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR),1 predominantly by modulating gene transcription (3Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. Poellinger L. Okret S. Wikstrom A.C.

Metab. 2000; 11: 6-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). An attractive mode of regulation, especially in light of the coordinated effects of glucocorticoids in maintaining homeostasis, is the opposing control of the samegene in different tissues by GR. PEPCK-C gene provides an optimal model for studying this mode of regulation. The transcription of this gene is stimulated by glucocorticoids in the liver and kidney (6Meisner H. Loose D.S. Hanson R.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Sasaki K. Crip T.P. Koch S.R. Andreone T.L. Petersen D.D. Beale E.G. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6405-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PEPCK-C catalyzes a key reaction that determines the rates of gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney and glyceroneogenesis in the adipose tissue and liver (9Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Glyceroneogenesis, the de novosynthesis of 3-glycerophosphate from pyruvate and amino acids (via an abbreviated version of gluconeogenesis), provides this precursor for the synthesis of triglycerides (10Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Leveille G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2746-2750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Reshef L. Niv J. Shapiro B. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 688-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have performed a targeted mutation in the adipose tissue-specific enhancer of the PEPCK-C gene in embryonic stem cells. The mutation ablated PEPCK-C gene expression in white adipose tissue of mice homozygous for this mutation and caused a decrease in the storage of triglycerides, which in some mice developed into lipodystrophy (12Olswang Y. Cohen H. Papo O. Cassuto H. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This mutation therefore established the importance of PEPCK-C and glyceroneogenesis in the homeostasis of triglycerides in the adipose tissue. Because PEPCK-C is encoded by a unique copy gene, and is transcribed from a single promoter, it is likely that tissue-specific factors are involved in the reciprocal regulation that leads to stimulation (liver and kidney) or repression (adipose tissue) of the gene transcription in the presence of glucocorticoids. Yamamoto and colleagues (13Diamond M.L. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) proposed the term composite GRE to describe a nonconsensus sequence that binds the GR with low affinity and, in turn, is capable of mediating either repression or activation of genes. The GRE identified in the PEPCK-C gene (14Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) is a nonconsensus sequence that binds GR at a very low affinity and is not able by itself to transmit a transcriptional response to glucocorticoids. In fact, PEPCK-C gene promoter harbors a GR unit (GRU) containing two low affinity, nonconsensus GR-binding sites and two accessory elements, AF1 and AF2. These elements do not bind steroid receptors, but their occupancy is required for the response of the PEPCK-C gene to glucocorticoids (see scheme in Fig. 2). The factors binding to the AF1 element are all nonsteroid nuclear receptors; these include hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4, chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor (COUPTF), retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor (RXR), and members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family. The AF2 site (15Faber S. O'Brien R.M. Imai E. Granner D.K. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) binds HNF3β (16Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E.

Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To identify tissue-specific factors that are involved in the glucocorticoid-mediated repression of PEPCK-C gene transcription in adipocytes, we have employed a systematic DNase I footprinting analysis of the PEPCK-C gene promoter, using adipocyte nuclear proteins. Their functional participation in the repression has been assessed using transient transfection experiments in PEPCK-nonexpressing NIH3T3 cells. The results from these two independent experimental systems consistently identified the involvement of members of the C/EBP family, but not those of PPAR, in the GR repression of the PEPCK-C gene promoter activity. Furthermore, experiments in NIH3T3 cells revealed a hierarchical constraint of PEPCK-C gene promoter trans-activation by the separate GRU elements. Both wild type and mutant GR (incapable of binding the DNA) repress the C/EBP-mediated trans-activation by 50–60%, regardless of whether the trans-activation is low or high. However, the repression by mutant GR critically requires an intact AF1 site in the PEPCK-C gene. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), F-12, and fetal and newborn calf serum were purchased from Biological Industries, Kibutz Beit Haemek, Israel. Biosynthetic human insulin was obtained from Novo Nordisk (Denmark). Dexamethasone, the synthetic glucocorticoid hormone, was purchased from Teva, Israel Pharmaceutical Industry. Ultraspec, the commercial reagent for the preparation of tissue RNA, was purchased from Biotecx Laboratories, Inc. (Austin, TX). Radioactive signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Fujix BAS 1000, Fuji, Japan). Reverse transcriptase was obtained from Invitrogen. Random hexanucleotide pd(N)6 was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and the ribonuclease inhibitor, RNasin, was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for the determination of human somatotropin was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 3T3-F442A cells, obtained from Dr. Howard Green (19Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), were grown to confluence in DMEM and supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. For differentiation of the cells to adipocytes, newborn calf serum was replaced by 10% fetal calf serum; isobutylmethylxanthine was added at a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the cells were incubated for 3 days. The cells were further incubated for at least 8 days in a medium containing 4 milliunits/ml insulin, until ∼80–90% of cells contained fat droplets. Dexamethasone (10−7m) was added to NIH3T3 cells no later than 20 h after transfection, when expression of the reporter gene was barely detected. Cells were harvested no later than 24 h after addition of dexamethasone to prevent cell lysis. 3T3-F442A adipocytes were similarly treated with 10−7m dexamethasone for 16–18 h. Total RNA was isolated from a single 100-mm cultured plate of 3T3-F442A adipocytes or from 30 mg of mouse liver using the commercial reagent Ultraspec according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed according to manufacturer's instructions, using the Invitrogen reverse transcriptase kit in the presence of 7.5 units/ml random hexanucleotide pd(N)6 as primer and 1 unit/μl RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, except that the incubation was for 30 min at 42 °C. PCR was performed using the PEPCK-C primers 5′-CTTGTCTACGAAGCTCTCAG from exon 9 and 3′-CGTCCGAACATCCACTC from exon 10. Primers for theaP2 gene were 5′-CCTGGAAGCTTGTCTCCAG from exon 1 and 3′-CTCTTGTGGAAGTCACGCC from exon 4. Primers for β-actin were the same as published previously (20Eden S. Hashimshony T. Keshet I. Cedar H. Thorne A.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 842Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). PCR was performed in the presence of a trace of [32P]dCTP (0.5 × 106 dpm) to allow semi-quantification (20Eden S. Hashimshony T. Keshet I. Cedar H. Thorne A.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 842Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The PCR program included denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min, 20 cycles each consisting of denaturation for 30 s, annealing for 1 min, and elongation for 1 min. The PCR product was separated by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gel and quantified using a PhosphorImager apparatus and visualized by its exposure to autoradiographic film. Nuclear proteins were extracted from rat liver according to Gorski et al. (21Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) as modified (22Trus M. Benvenisty N. Cohen H. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts from adipocytes were prepared essentially as described previously (22Trus M. Benvenisty N. Cohen H. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), except that the sucrose gradient step to further purify the nuclei was omitted. DNase I footprinting assays were performed as described previously (22Trus M. Benvenisty N. Cohen H. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The autoradiographic density signals of specific bands in the exposed film (see Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) were quantified using Fluor-STMMultiImager with Multianalyst version 1.1 (Bio-Rad). 5 μg of nuclear proteins from adipocytes treated or untreated with dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Protran BA 85, Schleicher & Schuell). C/EBPα was probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-C/EBPα antibody c100 diluted 1:1000 (a gift from Dr. Steven McKnight) and was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:4000. Nuclear Y12 protein was probed with mouse anti-sm monoclonal antibody Y12 (23Raitskin O. Cho D.S. Sperling J. Nishikura K. Sperling R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6571-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Ruth Sperling), diluted 1:10, and detected using horseradish peroxidase conjugated to affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab)′ fragment diluted 1:3000 (23Raitskin O. Cho D.S. Sperling J. Nishikura K. Sperling R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6571-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). NIH3T3 cells were grown on 100-mm plates in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, cells were transferred to DMEM containing 10% newborn calf serum. Transfection was performed essentially according to Chen and Okayama (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar), as described previously (25Yanuka-Kashles O. Cohen H. Trus M. Aran A. Benvenisty N. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7124-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), 1 or 2 days after the cells reached confluency. Supercoiled PEPCK-CAT plasmid (2 μg) and additional carrier pBlueScript DNA (Stratagene), to make a total of 12 μg, were used, and the transfection efficiency was monitored as described previously (25Yanuka-Kashles O. Cohen H. Trus M. Aran A. Benvenisty N. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7124-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Where indicated, 1 μg each of the expression vectors for C/EBPα and PPARγ2 together with RXRα or GR was used. The optimal quantity of C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ expression vectors added to the transfection mixture was 0.5 μg each. In all cases, titration test of various concentrations of the expression vectors allowed us to choose the amounts that yielded optimal effects. Assays for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity were determined 44 h after transfection, as described (25Yanuka-Kashles O. Cohen H. Trus M. Aran A. Benvenisty N. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7124-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and quantified using a PhosphorImager apparatus. The S.E. was calculated as the S.D. divided by the square root of the number of experiments. The previously described plasmid 597-pck-CAT (PCK (600)-CAT) contains 597 bp of the rat PEPCK-C gene promoter region fused to the CAT reporter gene (26Benvenisty N. Nechushtan H. Cohen H. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The derived 2000-pck-CAT plasmid (PCK(2000)-CAT) contains 2000 bp of the PEPCK-C gene promoter (27Cassuto H. Aran A. Cohen H. Eisenberger C.L. Reshef L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mutated AF1 (AF1-mut), the combined mutation of GRE1 and GRE2 (mGRE1–2) (28Liu J. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 738-741PubMed Google Scholar), and the mutated AF2 (AF2-mut) (29Lechner P.S. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Millward C. Fekter C. Yun J.S. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22675-22679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) plasmids contain 2000 bp of the rat PEPCK-C gene promoter mutated at these sites. The mouse promoters PCK(840)-CAT and PCK(1500)-CAT contain 840 or 1500 bp upstream from the transcription start site of PEPCK-C gene promoter, derived from a mouse genomic clone, and fused to the CAT reporter gene as described previously (26Benvenisty N. Nechushtan H. Cohen H. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The PCK(1500-mut)-CAT plasmid contains a site-specific mutation of the PPARE sequence. The mutation was generated by inserting the restriction sites XhoI and SmaI 3′ and 5′, respectively, to the PPARE site. This enabled us to replace the PPARE site with 47 bp of the pBlueScript polylinker residing between XhoI and SmaI, except that the EcoRI site of the polylinker insert was deleted. The DNA concentration of the constructs containing the longer PEPCK-C gene promoters was corrected to achieve the same number of molecules as that of the shorter PEPCK-C gene promoters. Expression vectors encoding adipocyte-enriched transcription factors used in this work included the following: C/EBPα (30Friedman A.D. Landschultz W.H. McKnight S.L.

Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The addition of glucocorticoids to fully differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes for 16–18 h caused a strong repression of PEPCK-C gene expression as shown by the absence of its RT-PCR product (Fig.1). This repression was distinct because glucocorticoids failed to inhibit the expression of the adipocyte-specific aP2 gene (Fig. 1). In order to assess whether GR affects the binding of nuclear proteins to specific sites in the PEPCK-C gene promoter, we systematically footprinted the gene promoter, using nuclear proteins extracted from 3T3-F442A adipocyte cells that had been incubated without or with glucocorticoids. A scheme of PEPCK-C gene promoter depicting the binding sites of transcription factors is shown (Fig. 2a). The figure also includes the binding sites for nuclear proteins present in the liver, fetal liver (where the gene for PEPCK-C is not actively transcribed (22Trus M. Benvenisty N. Cohen H. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Benvenisty N. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)), kidney, and adipocytes (Fig. 2b). Note that nuclear proteins from the liver and adipocytes bind to most sites included within positions −70 to −1200 of the transcription start site of the PEPCK-C gene promoter. Adipocyte nuclear proteins do not bind to the P2 site (HNF-1 recognition motif) in the PEPCK-C gene promoter (37Cassuto H. Olswang Y. Livoff A.F. Nechushtan H. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas nuclear proteins from the liver bind poorly to PPARE (the PPAR recognition site (see Fig.3b)). Unlike the kidney and fetal liver, nuclear proteins from adipocytes and liver bind all C/EBP recognition sites. These include the CRE-1 (cAMP-response element), P3I, P4, and CRE-2 sites (CRE-2 is a CRE-like sequence). Of these, P3I binds exclusively isoforms of the C/EBP family (38Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Nizielski S.E. Hakimi P. Cao Z. Moorman A. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 613-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CRE-1 and P4 sites bind AP1 as well, and CRE-1 also binds cAMP-response element-binding protein, ATF-2 (39Feife L.E. Obexer P. Andratsch M. Euler S. Taylor L. Tang A. Wei Y. Schramek H. Curthoys N.P. Gstraunthaler G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F678-F688Google Scholar), and ATF-3 (40Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20020-20025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CRE-2 binds C/EBPα with very low affinity but binds a nonidentified temperature-labile protein in the liver nuclear proteins (22Trus M. Benvenisty N. Cohen H. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our footprinting analysis revealed that nuclear proteins extracted from glucocorticoid-treated adipocytes failed to bind to all C/EBP recognition sites in the PEPCK-C gene promoter: CRE-1 (Fig.2c), P3 and P4 (Fig. 2d), and the single C/EBP-like CRE-2 site (Fig. 2c). The prominent inhibition of binding to all these sites occurred despite the wide spectrum of affinities of the C/EBP recognition sites to C/EBPα, which gradually decreases from the highest affinity (CRE-1 site) to the lowest (CRE-2 site) (22Trus M. Benvenisty N. Cohen H. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 41Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D. Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, binding to the P1 site (nuclear factor 1 recognition site) in the PEPCK-C gene promoter was also inhibited (Fig.2c), although this is not a C/EBP recognition site. In previous studies (38Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Nizielski S.E. Hakimi P. Cao Z. Moorman A. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 613-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the binding of C/EBPβ to CRE-1 has been shown to cooperate with the binding to the P1 site. Therefore, a reduced binding to CRE-1 site might have led to a secondary effect on the binding to the P1 site. The binding of adipocyte nuclear proteins to the recognition sites of nuclear receptors in the PEPCK-C gene promoter has not been affected by the glucocorticoid treatment. Thus, binding to AF1 site (also termed P6) remained similar whether using nuclear proteins from adipocytes not treated or treated with glucocorticoids (Fig. 3a). AF1 site is a nuclear receptor recognition site that interacts with a variety of nonsteroid nuclear receptors including HNF4, COUPTF, retinoic acid receptor, RXR, and members of the PPAR family. Similar to adipocytes, hepatic nuclear proteins also interact well with the AF1 site (Fig.3a). Another non-C/EBP-binding site, which likewise has not been affected by the glucocorticoid treatment, is PPARE (the recognition site of the heterodimer nuclear receptors PPARγ2/RXR) (Fig. 3b). In contrast to the adipocyte nuclear proteins, binding of hepatic nuclear proteins to the PPARE site could barely be detected (Fig.3b), unlike their efficient binding to the AF1 site (Fig.3a). Furthermore, the hypersensitive site (position −985) at the 3′ end of the protected region appeared only in the presence of adipocyte nuclear proteins. It was undetectable both in the absence of nuclear proteins and in the presence of liver nuclear proteins (Fig.3b). Therefore, PPAR isoforms seem less enriched in the liver (from nonfasted rat) than they are in adipocyte nuclear proteins. To gain quantitative estimation of the glucocorticoid effect, we measured the density signals of specific bands inside and outside the protected regions of the CRE-1 (Fig. 2a) and AF1 (Fig.3a) sites. The footprinting intensity of the CRE-1 site was quantified from the autoradiographic films by measuring the density signal of a band within the CRE-1 site (position −88 from the transcription start site of the PEPCK-C gene) and a band outside, at position −160 (both marked by arrows). Likewise, the footprinting intensity of the AF1 site was quantified by measuring the density signals of two bands inside (positions −445 and −446) and a band outside (position −457) the AF1 site. The ratios between the density signals inside and outside the protected region were computed. The ratios obtained from the footprinting done without nuclear proteins were arbitrarily set at 10 and used to normalize other ratios of the footprinting done in the presence of nuclear proteins. These measurements have clearly assessed that dexamethasone treatment interfered with the adipocyte nuclear protein footprinting of the CRE-1 site (Fig. 3c) but not with the footprinting of the AF1 site (Fig. 3d). Transcription of the gene for C/EBPα is also repressed by glucocorticoids but only for a few hours (32MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Lin F.-T. Chen S.S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet this repression might lead to a longer lasting reduction of C/EBPα protein concentration in adipocyte nuclei (32MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Lin F.-T. Chen S.S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in an apparent, rather than real, interference of binding to its recognition sites. Therefore, we determined whether the concentration of C/EBPα in nuclei corresponded to the observed diminished footprinting of the PEPCK-C gene promoter. The concentration of C/EBPα in the adipocyte extracts of nuclear proteins used for footprinting was determined by Western blot assay. The hormonal treatment diminished the nuclear concentration of C/EBPα by 30% when normalized to the level of the Y12 nuclear protein (Fig. 4a). Whether this reduced concentration of C/EBPα accounted for the inhibited footprinting of nuclear proteins from glucocorticoid-treated adipocytes was assessed. Thus, we used lower amounts of nuclear proteins extracted from untreated adipocytes (10 (2/3) and 7.5 μg (1/2)), compared with the whole amount (15 μg), to footprint the gene promoter region containing the CRE-1, P1, and CRE-2 sites. This region enabled us to assay the site with the highest affinity for C/EBP binding (CRE-1) and the site with the lowest affinity for C/EBP binding (CRE-2). The analysis showed that 10 μg of nuclear proteins footprinted all three sites (Fig. 4b). Footprinting of the CRE-1 site was quantified as detailed above for Fig. 2c. Thus, the ratio in the absence of proteins was set at 10, relative to a ratio of 2.5 obtained with 10 μg of protein and a ratio of 8.5 obtained with 7.5 μg of protein (Fig. 4c). The dexamethasone effect on CRE-1 footprinting (Fig. 2c) that was likewise quantified yielded a ratio of 1.7 in the presence of 15 μg of nuclear proteins from untreated adipocytes, and 15.8 in the presence of 15 μg of nuc"

Within the group I PAK family, γ-PAK has distinct properties compared with other PAK isoforms. γ-PAK appears to be ubiquitous, whereas α- and β-PAK have greater tissue specificity. γ-PAK is primarily inactive in dividing cells and is transiently activated when cells are subjected to moderate stress conditions such as hyperosmolarity, ionizing radiation, and DNA-damaging drugs (1Roig J.

A function for γ-PAK was suggested initially by microinjection of active γ-PAK into early frog embryos; active γ-PAK inhibited cell cleavage, whereas inactive γ-PAK had no inhibitory effect (8Rooney R.D.

In addition to transient activation by Cdc42 in response to moderate stress, γ-PAK is degraded through the proteosome pathway after ubiquitination (12Roig J. Tuazon P.T. Zipfel P.A. Pendergast A.M.

All members of the group I PAKs contain two functional domains, an N-terminal regulatory domain (residues 1–246 in γ-PAK) and a C-terminal catalytic domain (residues 247–524). The G protein binding site, which is also conserved in the Ste20 PAK isoform inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (21Peter M. Neiman A.M. Park H.O. Van Lohuizen M. Herskowitz I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7046-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), is located at residues 73–108 in γ-PAK (1Roig J. Traugh J.A. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 62: 167-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In γ-PAK, Lys-278 coordinates ATP in the active site, and the mutant K278R is kinase inactive (9Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

Upon binding of Cdc42(GTP) or cleavage by caspase 3, an additional three sites are autophosphorylated, resulting in activation of the protein kinase. A site shown to be involved in activation of γ-PAK is Thr-402, the conserved threonine in the activation loop; the mutant T402A (mimicking nonphosphorylated threonine) has little protein kinase activity (9Walter B.N.

Ser-490 in the sequence KRGS is a potential autophosphorylation site for γ-PAK and for phosphorylation by protein kinase C. Ser-490 is located adjacent to a region involved in binding to the β-subunit of the trimeric G protein (26Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This region is removed in the truncated mutant Δ488 that lacks the C-terminal 36 amino acid residues. Conditions of hyperosmolarity and the addition of sphingosine to cultured cells result in translocation of γ-PAK to the particulate fraction and subsequent activation of the enzyme (6Roig J. Huang Z.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It was thus of interest to examine whether intracellular localization had an effect on the cytostatic activity of γ-PAK. In this study, we examined the subcellular localization and cytostatic activity of γ-PAK in mammalian cells as shown by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and immunocytochemistry. Recombinant WT γ-PAK and S490A are associated primarily with the particulate fraction and are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In contrast, the kinase-inactive γ-PAK mutants K278R and T402A and the C-terminal mutants S490D and Δ488 are present only as soluble enzymes and are present in the nucleus and the cytosol. WT γ-PAK and S490A inhibit cell growth, whereas the other mutants have no inhibitory effect. Taken together, the data show that subcellular localization of active γ-PAK is essential for the induction of cytostasis. GTPγS was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

To make the C-terminal deletion mutant Δ488, a 1.2-kb DNA fragment encoding residues 1–487 was generated by PCR with primers GATCCATATGTCTGATAACGGAGAAC and TCTAGAGGATCCTTATTTTTCCACATCCAT. The PCR product was cleaved withNdeI and XbaI and ligated into the pBlue-NK plasmid. To prepare the double mutants K278R/S490A and K278R/S490D, a 1.2-kb DNA fragment encoding residues 1–402 was cleaved from the pBlue-NK γ-PAK K278R plasmid with NdeI and NcoI and inserted into pBlue-NK γ-PAK S490A or S490D precleaved withNdeI and NcoI. The resulting double mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Kozak consensus sequence ACCATG followed by the DNA sequence encoding a HA tag, YPYDVPDYA, was inserted immediately before the start site of γ-PAK using PCR and was verified by DNA sequencing. HA-tagged rabbit γ-PAK was cloned into the pcDNA3.1+ expression plasmid at the KpnI and XbaI sites. The monkey kidney cell line COS-7 and the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T were maintained by serial passage in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator. Transient transfection of 293T and COS-7 cells was carried out with Superfect transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were plated in 75-cm2 flasks; the following day, the cells were transfected for 3 h with 10 μg of pcDNA3.1+ HA-tagged WT or mutant γ-PAK. Two μg of pcDNA3.1+ LacZ was cotransfected as a control of transfection efficiency. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 100 μl of COWIE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and frozen at −70 °C. The cells were thawed and vortexed, and the lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C; the resulting supernatant and particulate fractions were used for further analysis. To detect HA-tagged γ-PAK, the supernatant and particulate fractions from ∼5 × 105 293T cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and the protein transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The samples were probed with mouse anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (1:1,000) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) and detected by chemiluminescence. To assay for protein kinase activity, γ-PAK was immunoprecipitated from the Nonidet P-40-solubilized lysate by incubation with 2 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 for 2 h at 4 °C. After the addition of 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose, incubation was continued for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and three times with PBS. To activate γ-PAK by cleavage with caspase 3, the immunoprecipitates were suspended in 30 μl of caspase cleavage buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% CHAPS) and incubated in the presence or absence of caspase 3 for 30 min at 37 °C. For activation of γ-PAK by Cdc42(GTPγS), the immunoprecipitates were incubated in 30 μl of PBS with 1 μg of Cdc42 preloaded with 0.18 mm GTPγS for 5 min at 30 °C. Protein kinase activity was assayed in a volume of 70 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 30 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 μg of histone 4, and [γ-32P]ATP (2,000 dpm/pmol) for 30 min at 30 °C; these were kinetically valid conditions. Phosphorylation of histone 4 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. To analyze protein kinase with similar amounts of recombinant WT and mutant γ-PAK protein, the number of cells was adjusted, and the level of protein was determined by Western blotting. Lysates were prepared from 2.4 × 107 cells for WT γ-PAK and S490A, from 9 × 106 cells for Δ488, and from 3 × 106 cells for K278R, S490D, and T402A and assayed as described above. Radiolabeled histone 4 was excised and counted in a scintillation counter. Aliquots (10 μl) of the same immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody to ensure that identical amounts of proteins were used. To assay for protein kinase activity with the synthetic heptapeptide S3 (AKRESAA), 1 mm S3 was added to the assay described above in place of histone 4. Phosphorylated S3 was analyzed on P81 phosphocellulose paper, as described previously (25Tuazon P.T. Spanos W.C. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Traugh J.A.

Approximately 1 × 105 COS-7 cells were plated onto glass coverslips and transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1+ HA-tagged γ-PAK plasmid. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and washed three times with PBS. After blocking with 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h, the cells were probed for γ-PAK with mouse anti-HA antibody (1:200) and for the ER marker calreticulin with rabbit polyclonal antibody PA3-900 (1:200). The cells were washed three times with PBS, then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with rhodamine (1:200) to identify the HA tag, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescin (1:200) to identify calreticulin. After washing twice with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides and analyzed using a confocal laser scanning imaging system. The images were analyzed with Bio-Rad Confocal Assistant™ image analysis program. The transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfection of γ-PAK with the pcDNA3.1+ LacZ plasmid, and LacZ was assayed 2 days post-transfection. The transfection efficiency was ∼7% for COS-7 cells. To examine the effects of expression of WT and mutant γ-PAK on cell proliferation, COS-7 cells were transfected on coverslips, probed with anti-HA antibody, and stained as described above. The cells were monitored every 24 h for 4 days using a fluorescent microscope. About 100–600 cells were counted at each time point from 10 images for each sample; the 5 images nearest the average were used for quantitative measurements. 293T cells were grown on collagen-coated six-well plates and transfected with HA-tagged WT γ-PAK and the mutants K278R, T402A, S490A, S490D, and Δ488 in the pTracer vector (Invitrogen) using Superfect reagent. The pTracer vector also contained the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene under a different promoter, which allowed coexpression of γ-PAK and green fluorescent protein in the same cell. One and 2 days post-transfection, living cells were examined for the green fluorescent protein positive signal under an inverted microscope (Eclipse TE300, Nikon). The same sample was fixed with 4% formaldehyde for in situ immunofluorescence staining of γ-PAK with anti-HA antibody as described. The coexpression of γ-PAK and green fluorescent protein was evaluated using a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse E800, Nikon). Total cells (1,000–2,000) and fluorescent cells were counted from multiple images. To correlate the subcellular localization with γ-PAK activity, sucrose density gradient fractionation of the postnuclear supernatant from 293T cells was carried out as described (28Rexach M.F. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 29Sfeir C. Veis A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with some modifications. At 48 h post-transfection, ∼3 × 106 cells were harvested and washed with PBS and with buffer A as described by Sfeir and Veis (29Sfeir C. Veis A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was resuspended and kept on ice for 5 min in 250 μl of buffer A and then homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (pestle B). The homogenization was monitored under a light microscope and generally resulted in >98% cell lysis. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was discarded, and the postnuclear supernatant was fractionated as described below. Preparation of sucrose density gradients followed the procedure described by Rexach and Schekman (28Rexach M.F. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The postnuclear supernatant (250 μl) was loaded onto the top of a 2.5-ml gradient and centrifuged for 2 h at 30,000 rpm in a Beckman rotor (SW 60Ti) at 4 °C. Eleven fractions of 250 μl each were collected from the bottom of the tube. The protein in each fraction was precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 50% acetone at −20 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the pellet was washed twice with cold acetone, air-dried, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with antibody to the HA tag. Endogenous γ-PAK was detected with goat anti-γ-PAK polyclonal antibody N19 followed by horseradish peroxidase-mouse anti-goat IgG. Calreticulin was detected with rabbit antibody PA3-900 followed by horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Ionizing radiation of 293T cells was performed as described previously (6Roig J. Huang Z. Lytle C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16933-16940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated for 2 h before analysis of localization of γ-PAK. To examine γ-PAK activity, Nonidet P-40 was added at a final concentration of 1% to a 30-μl sample from each fraction from the sucrose density gradient. The samples were incubated in the presence and absence of caspase 3 for 30 min at 37 °C and assayed with histone 4 as described above. Phosphorylation of H4 was quantified using a Bio-Rad phosphorimaging IMAGEQuant program. Specific activity was determined by assaying for protein kinase activity under kinetically valid conditions (see above), and γ-PAK protein was quantified by immunoblotting. The cleavage of γ-PAK by caspase 3 was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody after SDS-PAGE, as described above, to detect HA-tagged γ-PAK p58 (full-length) and p27 (caspase-cleaved N terminus) in the fractions. To examine the effects of γ-PAK expression on cell proliferation, recombinant WT γ-PAK and three mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed over a 4-day period. Expression of γ-PAK was detected by immunofluorescence using anti-HA tag antibody, and antibody to calreticulin was used to determine the total number of cells. Approximately 7% of the cells were transfected, and the number of cells increased ∼6-fold over the 4-day period, with a doubling time of 24 h (Fig. 1A). The number of cells expressing WT γ-PAK remained constant over time, whereas the nontransfected cells continued dividing. The approximate number of cells expressing K278R on day 1 was comparable with the WT γ-PAK; however, the cells with K278R continued dividing over the first 3 days and remained at that level on day 4, the time limit for protein expression through transient transfection. S490A had an expression pattern similar to that of WT γ-PAK, whereas expression of S490D was comparable with that of K278R. The results indicate that expression of WT γ-PAK and S490A resulted in induction of cytostasis, whereas K278R and S490D had no effect on cell division. Experiments with 293T cells showed that the number of cells expressing the WT γ-PAK and S490A remained constant over a 2-day incubation period, whereas the nontransfected cells continued dividing. Thus, the percentage of cells expressing these two forms of γ-PAK was reduced from 21–24% on day 1 to 10–11% on day 2 (Fig. 1B). Cells expressing the kinase-inactive mutants K278R and T402A and the C-terminal mutants S490D and Δ488 were expressed at around 30% on days 1 and 2, indicating that 293T cells tranfected with these mutants continued dividing. Thus, the data supported the conclusions reached with COS-7 cells, that WT γ-PAK and S490A induced a cytostatic response. The WT and mutant forms of HA-tagged γ-PAK were analyzed after expression in 293T cells. γ-PAK in the supernatant and particulate fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibody to the HA tag. As shown in Fig. 2A, WT γ-PAK was present in both the supernatant and the particulate fractions. The amount of recombinant WT γ-PAK in the particulate fraction was 80% of that in the supernatant. Recombinant γ-PAK comigrated on SDS-PAGE with the major band of endogenous γ-PAK (58 kDa) present in the soluble and particulate fractions (as detected with N19 antibody). The kinase-inactive mutant K278R was expressed at a level 8.8-fold higher than the recombinant WT enzyme but was present only in the supernatant (Fig. 2A). A similar expression pattern was observed with T402A, which contained a mutated autophosphorylation site in the activation loop. When two mutants of the potential autophosphorylation site Ser-490 were examined, S490A (mimicking nonphosphorylated serine) was expressed at a level slightly less than WT γ-PAK and was present in both fractions. The level of S490D (mimicking phosphoserine) was 8.1-fold higher than the WT γ-PAK, a level similar to that of the kinase-inactive mutants, and was present only in the supernatant. The kinase-active mutant Δ488, which lacked the C-terminal 36 amino acid residues including Ser-490, was expressed at a 3.3-fold higher level than the WT and was present only in the supernatant. With the double mutants K278R/S490A and K278R/S490D, the amount of expressed protein and the pattern of expression were similar to those of K278R. Wild type γ-PAK and S490A migrated as a 58-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE, whereas K278R, T402A, S490D, and the double mutants migrated at 60 kDa. In contrast, the catalytic domain of γ-PAK was expressed at levels 20–50-fold lower than those of the full-length wild-type protein and was highly unstable in 293T cells as well as in insect cells (data not shown). The level of expression of WT γ-PAK was ∼40% of the endogenous γ-PAK protein in 293T cells. The relative levels of expression and mobility on SDS-PAGE of WT γ-PAK and the mutants are the same in COS-7 and 293T cells. To measure the protein kinase activity of γ-PAK expressed in 293T cells, ∼5 × 106 cells were collected at 48 h post-transfection. γ-PAK was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with anti-HA antibody and a"

This 5-fold increase in apparent affinity was not species-specific since bovine DEGR-APC also showed a similar GlcCer-dependent enhancement of binding of APC to PC/PS vesicles. From the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, distances of closest approach of ∼63 and ∼64 Å were estimated between the dansyl on DEGR-APC and rhodamine in PC/PS/GlcCer(OR) and PC/PS(OR), respectively, assuming κ2 = 2/3.

These data suggest that APC binds to GlcCer, that PC/PS/GlcCer vesicles like PC/PS vesicles bind to the N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain of APC, and that one mechanism by which GlcCer enhances the activity of APC is by increasing its affinity for membrane surfaces containing negatively charged phospholipids.

Both procoagulant and anticoagulant reactions occur at a physiologically significant rate only when the respective enzymes form multicomponent complexes on lipid membrane surfaces (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Thus, membranes play a pivotal role in regulating blood coagulation reactions. The molecular details of mechanism(s) by which various lipids affect coagulation are not fully understood. Many groups have observed that lipid vesicles containing negatively charged phospholipids, especially phosphatidylserine (PS),1bind and markedly enhance the rate of activation of procoagulant enzymes (2Lundbland R.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3226-3233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the high rate of activation of procoagulant enzymes in the presence of vesicles containing PS is due in large part to enhancement of substrate binding to the negatively charged surface of the phospholipid bilayer. The resulting high local concentration of substrate on the membrane surface can enhance diffusion of substrate to the activation complex in two dimensions rather than in three dimensions (10Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the significance of this proposed mechanism has been controversial and alternative models have been proposed to explain many kinetic data (11Lu Y. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8201-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Lu Y. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8193-8200Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), current paradigms most often assume that membranes only provide a surface template for the assembly and function of the various procoagulant enzyme-containing multicomponent complexes and that the procoagulant phospholipids do not play a more active role in the blood coagulation reaction. However, it has been recently reported that submicellar concentrations of a short chain variant of phosphatidylserine, namely dicaproyl phosphatidylserine, enhances the rate of activation of both prothrombin by the prothrombinase complex and factor X by the Xase complex (13Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Gilbert G.E. Arena A.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10768-10776Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These data suggest the existence of a functionally significant binding site(s) for C6PS on one or more procoagulant plasma proteins and that the occupancy of these sites by the phospholipid molecules activates the clotting factors. If there are functionally important PS-binding sites on some procoagulant proteins, do such functionally important lipid-binding sites also exist in anticoagulant proteins? Although both procoagulant and anticoagulant reactions are markedly enhanced by the presence of negatively charged surfaces in vitro, certain lipids and lipoproteins selectively enhance anticoagulant reactions in plasma (15Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fernández J.A. Kojima K. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Blood Cells Mol.

Invest. 1999; 103: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Recently, Deguchi and co-workers reported that plasma glucosylceramide (GlcCer) deficiency is a potential risk factor for venous thrombosis and that depletion or augmentation of GlcCer in normal plasma either reduces or enhances, respectively, the anticoagulant response to activated protein C (APC) (18Deguchi H. Fernández J.A. Pabinger I. Heit J.A. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Subsequently, they reported that certain glycolipids such as GlcCer, lactosylceramide, and globotriaosylceramide, enhance the anticoagulant response of APC (19Deguchi H. Fernández J.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8861-8865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the mechanism by which such glycolipids may enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC. To test the hypothesis that GlcCer increases the anticoagulant activity of APC by increasing its affinity for lipid surfaces where anticoagulant reactions can occur, the binding of APC to GlcCer-containing phospholipid vesicles was examined using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Additionally, we have also examined whether there is a unique GlcCer binding site(s) on APC, the occupancy of which augments APC activity. 5-Dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-glutamylglycyl arginyl chloromethylketone (DEGR-CK) was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).

Human APC was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Bovine APC was obtained as a gift from Dr. Mary J. Heeb, The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA). Factor Va (fVa) and factor Xa (fXa) were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Bovine and human APCs were active site-specific-labeled with either fluorescein (20Yegneswaran S. Fernández J.A. Griffin J.H. Dawson P.E. Chem.

Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the fluorescein and coumarin labeling, Nα-fluorescein-p benzoyl phenylalanyl-lysyl (Nε bromoacetyl) amide and 7-diethylamino-3-((4′-(iodoacetyl)amino)phenyl)-4-methylcoumarin were used, respectively, instead of the 5-iodoacetamido fluorescein. Multicomponent vesicles of PC/PS (9:1 w/w ratio), PC/PS/GlcCer (8:1:1), PC/GlcCer (9:1), PC/PS/galactosylceramide (GalCer) (8:1:1), PC/PS/globotetraosylceramide (PC/PS/Gb4Cer; 8:1:1), and 100% PC were prepared according to procedures described earlier (18Deguchi H. Fernández J.A. Pabinger I. Heit J.A. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, pure lipids in chloroform were mixed in the appropriate ratios, and then the chloroform was evaporated under nitrogen gas to give 1 mg of solid lipid mixture in a vial. This lipid mixture was then resuspended in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl. The suspension was quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed immediately in a 37 °C water bath. This freeze-thaw cycle was repeated 10 times. Finally, the suspension was transferred to an extrusion chamber (Osmonics, Livermore, CA), and vesicles were prepared by extruding the solution through a 0.22-μm filter (15 passes through the filter). A [14C]PC tracer was added to each preparation at the beginning of the procedure to facilitate determination of postextrusion phospholipid recovery. The concentration of glycolipids recovered was determined by measuring sugar head groups of the glycolipids using an orcinol-based colorimetric assay (18Deguchi H. Fernández J.A. Pabinger I. Heit J.A. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the plane-to-plane FRET experiments, vesicles containing the acceptor dye octadecylrhodamine OR were also prepared as above except that the desired volume from a solution of OR in ethyl acetate was added to the lipid mixture prior to drying with nitrogen. The concentration of OR was determined as before as was ς, the OR acceptor density at the vesicle surface (23Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The procoagulant and anticoagulant properties of vesicles containing GlcCer were determined using fXa-initiated clotting assays with exogenously added human or bovine APC. For these assays, GlcCer-containing vesicles at varying doses (50 μl) were mixed with normal plasma (25 μl), human or bovine APC (34.5 nm final), or buffer (TBS containing 0.1% BSA, 30 μl) and incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. Then, fXa (50 μl, 0.3 nm final) in buffer containing 30 mmCaCl2 was added to initiate clotting, and clotting times were recorded using an Amelung KC4 microcoagulometer (Sigma). The response to APC was expressed as a ratio of clotting times that was calculated by dividing the clotting time in the presence of APC by the baseline clotting time in the absence of APC. Modified dilute prothrombin time-based assays were also performed as previously described (17Griffin J.H. Kojima K. Banka C.L. Curtis L.K. Fernández J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 18Deguchi H. Fernández J.A. Pabinger I. Heit J.A. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, 7.5 μl of plasma was mixed with varying concentrations of C8-GlcCer or C8-Cer and incubated for 3 min at 37 °C with fibrinogen (0.6 mg/ml final) and APC (8.7 nm final) plus protein S (28 nm final) or buffer (100 μl total). Clotting times were measured after addition of 50 μl of recombinant tissue factor (Innovin® from DADE, Miami, FL) diluted 1:64 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA and 30 mm CaCl2. To study the effect of GlcCer on APC-dependent inactivation of factor Va, APC (0.94 nm) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with factor Va (1 nm) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of PC/PS, PC/PS/GlcCer, PC/GlcCer, or PC vesicles, respectively. Then the reaction was quenched by the addition of a 2-fold molar excess of EDTA over CaCl2, an aliquot of the reaction mix was withdrawn, and the residual factor Va activity was determined using a prothrombin time-clotting assay using a fVa-deficient plasma. All spectral measurements were made using a SLM AB2 or a SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco, Rochester, NY) as described earlier (22Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol.

Fluorescein, dansyl, and coumarin dye emissions were detected at excitation and emission maxima of 490, 340, and 390 nm and 525, 540, and 462 nm, respectively. All experiments were performed using 5 × 5-mm quartz cuvettes. Sample were mixed, and adsorption of proteins to cuvette walls was minimized as described (24Dell V.A. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E.

The interaction of APC with various preparations of multicomponent lipid vesicles was monitored using plane-to-plane FRET between donor dyes in the active site of APC and acceptors on the membrane surface. Either fluorescein-labeled APC (Fl-APC), or dansyl-labeled APC (DEGR-APC) served as donors and rhodamine imbedded on the membrane surface served as acceptors. FRET experiments were performed as before (26Hackeng T.M. Yegneswaran S. Johnson A.E. Griffin J.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) except that the D (donor-containing)- and DA (donor and acceptor)-containing cuvettes initially received 100 nm of the donor DEGR-APC (or Fl-APC), whereas cuvettes A (containing acceptor) and B (blank) received 100 nm unlabeled EGR-APC (or FPR-APC) (22Yegneswaran S.

Spectral parameters including quantum yields (Φ), spectral overlap integrals (JDA), and distance of 50% energy transfer (Ro) for these experiments are described as before (23Husten E.J. Esmon C.T.

The distance of closest approach (R) was calculated using the relation Equation 1QD/QDA=1+(πσRo2/2)(Ro/R)4Eq. 1 where QD/QDA is the ratio of donor quantum yields in the presence and absence of acceptor and ς is the density of acceptor chromophores (OR) at the membrane surface. Four samples were prepared in parallel for each energy transfer experiment: cuvette D (containing donor) and cuvette DA (containing donor and acceptor) each received 100 nm of coumarin-labeled APC (donor), whereas cuvettes A (containing acceptor) and B received 100 nm unlabeled FPR-APC. The net initial emission intensity (Fo) was obtained by the subtraction of the signal of B from D, DA, and A. Samples D and B were titrated with short chain lipids lacking the acceptor dye NBD, whereas samples DA and A were titrated with short chain lipids conjugated to the NBD acceptor. The net intensity of D, DA, or A (FD, FDA, andFA, respectively) was obtained by subtracting the signal from the B cuvette and correcting for dilution. To correct for any signal in DA sample due to direct excitation of the acceptor, the net dilution-corrected emission intensity from A was subtracted from the DA sample signal. Making the reasonable assumption that the absorption of coumarin in the active site is unaffected by the presence of NBD-labeled lipids, the ratio of donor quantum yields in D and DA samples is given by Equation 2, QD/QDA=[FD/FD]/[(FDA−FA)/(FDA−FA)o]Eq. 2 where F is the net dilution-corrected emission intensity of a sample at some point in the titration and the subscript “o” is used to donate the initial intensity of the sample. For titrations in the presence of C8-GlcCer, 100 nmcoumarin-APC was first incubated with 15 μm C8-GlcCer before point-to-point FRET experiments were performed with NBD-labeled phospholipids as described above. The distance R between coumarin donor in the active site groove of APC and NBD acceptor conjugated to the phospholipid was determined using the relation in Equation 3,E=Ro6/(Ro6+R6)Eq. 3 where Ro is the distance at which FRET is 50% efficient and E is the efficiency of FRET given by Equation 4.E=1−(QDA/QD)Eq. 4 The critical micellar concentration (CMC) of C8-GlcCer in 50 mmHepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mmCaCl2 was determined using diphenyl hexatriene (DPH) fluorescence and 90 ° light scattering. DPH is an aggregation-sensitive dye and has been used to determine the CMC of lipids (13Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Two samples were prepared in parallel for each experiment. The first sample (S) contained DPH (15 μm final) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2, whereas the second sample contained a dye-free B. DPH fluorescence was monitored at 365 nm excitation and 460 nm emission, respectively. The net initial emission intensity termedFo was obtained by subtracting the initial intensity of B from the initial intensity S. The samples S and B were then titrated with increasing concentrations of lipids. Relative fluorescence intensity (F/Fo), calculated using Equation 5, was plotted against lipid concentration. F/Fo=(FS−FB)/(FS−FB)oEq. 5 F is the net dilution-corrected emission intensity of a sample at some point in the titration and the subscripto is used to denote the initial intensity of the sample. A plot of F/Foversus lipid concentration gave two linear slopes, and the intercept of the two linear slopes was taken as the CMC of C8-GlcCer. The CMC of C8-GlcCer in the presence of 100 nm FPR-APC was similarly determined. The CMC of C8-GlcCer was also determined by 90 ° light scattering using a SLM AB2 spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco, Rochester, NY) with emission and excitation wavelengths of 320 nm. Experiments were performed with a band pass of 2 nm on both excitation and emission light paths. All buffers for light scattering were prepared dust-free by filtration using a 0.22-μm Acrodisc syringe filter units (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI) and by centrifuging dust particles using a Microfuge before light-scattering experiments. The scatter intensity (I) of monomeric C8-GlcCer is much lower than multimeric aggregates or micelles of C8-GlcCer, and the concentration at which the scatter intensity increased sharply was taken as the CMC of GlcCer. The CMC of C16,6-NBD phosphatidylserine and C16,6-NBD phosphatidylcholine were determined by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of the NBD reporter for increasing concentrations of lipid. NBD anisotropy decreases sharply upon lipid aggregation due to homo-FRET (27Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: A663Google Scholar). NBD anisotropy was measured using Glan-Thompson prism polarizers placed on both the excitation and emission beam paths at 466 and 536 nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The emission intensity measured when the sample was excited by vertically plane-polarized light and the emission detected through a horizontal polarized light was termedIVH. IVV,IHH, and IHV were defined analogously. Anisotropy (r) was determined using the relation in Equation 6,r=(IVV−GIVH)/(IVV+2GIVH)Eq. 6 where the grating factor G equalsIHV/IVH. The effect of GlcCer on the anticoagulant response of plasma to human and bovine APC was tested using fXa-induced clotting assays (Fig.1). Both PC/PS and PC/PS/GlcCer vesicles enhanced the anticoagulant response of both species of APC. The steeper slope for the GlcCer-containing vesicles compared with the vesicles lacking GlcCer (Fig. 1) indicates that incorporation of GlcCer into PC/PS increased the anticoagulant response of both species of APC. A GlcCer-dependent enhancement of APC activity was also observed in a tissue factor-induced dilute prothrombin-clotting assays (data not shown) showing that GlcCer serves as a lipid cofactor for both human and bovine APC. The anticoagulant activity of APC observed in a fXa-induced clotting assay, which is due to the inactivation of fVa by APC, was studied using four different vesicle surfaces, 100% PC, PC/PS (9:1 w/w), PC/GlcCer (9:1), and PC/PS/GlcCer (8:1:1) (Fig.2). Under the experimental conditions used, APC inactivated very little fVa on 100% PC vesicles and PC/GlcCer vesicles, whereas PC/PS and PC/PS/GlcCer vesicles supported APC-dependent inactivation of fVa. The APC-dependent inactivation of fVa was most efficient using 400 μg/ml of PC/PS/GlcCer vesicles where ∼70% of fVa activity was lost in 5 min (Fig. 2). For PC/PS vesicles, 40% of fVa activity was lost under similar experimental conditions. Therefore, these data show that GlcCer enhanced APC-dependent inactivation of fVa in the presence of 10% PS. To test the hypothesis that GlcCer alters interaction of human APC with membranes, the binding of human APC to lipid vesicles containing GlcCer was compared with binding to vesicles lacking GlcCer. For these experiments, FRET was used to monitor APC binding to lipid vesicles (22Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). APC labeled in the active site with either a fluorescein (Fl-APC) or a dansyl (DEGR-APC) reporter served as a donor, whereas rhodamine dyes in OR at the aqueous-lipid interface served as the acceptor. When human Fl-APC was titrated with PC/PS vesicles, only a very small (3%) decrease in fluorescein emission was observed (data not shown). Likewise, a very small change in fluorescein emission was also detected when Fl-APC was titrated with PC/PS/GlcCer, PC, or PC/GlcCer vesicles (data not shown). However, when Fl-APC was titrated with PC/PS (or PC/PS/GlcCer, PC, or PC/GlcCer) vesicles containing OR acceptor, the fluorescein intensity decreased until sufficient phospholipids were added to bind all of the Fl-APC (22Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This OR-dependent decrease in fluorescein intensity results largely from FRET from the fluorescein dye in the active site of APC to the OR at the membrane surface (22Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To facilitate data analysis, the data were normalized and expressed as a ratio of donor quantum yields in the presence (QDA) or absence (QD) of the acceptor using Equation 1. When no acceptor-containing vesicles were present, the ratio ofQDA/QD was 1, whereas in the presence of these lipids, the value ofQDA/QD was less than 1 due to FRET. Fig. 3A presents data for titrations of human Fl-APC using four different vesicles containing similar OR acceptor density. The ratio ofQDA/QD showed a similar dependence on lipid concentration for the PC/PS, PC, and PC/GlcCer vesicles titrations, decreasing and reaching a plateau at ∼30 μg/ml vesicle concentration. However, the same plateau value was reached at a much lower lipid concentration in the PC/PS/GlcCer titration. These data suggest that PC/PS, PC, and PC/GlcCer vesicles have approximately the same affinity for human APC, whereas PC/PS/GlcCer vesicles have a greater affinity for Fl-APC. Apparent dissociation constant (Kd app) calculations based on curve fitting showed that the affinity for Fl-APC was 5-fold greater for the PC/PS/GlcCer vesicles (3 μg/ml) compared with PC/PS vesicles (16 μg/ml). Thus, the incorporation of GlcCer into PC/PS vesicles significantly increased the affinity of vesicles for APC. Although vesicles composed of only PC are inactive in our functional assays (see Fig. 2), these vesicles bound to Fl-APC with almost the same affinity as the functionally active PC/PS vesicles as reported in an earlier study (27Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: A663Google Scholar). This discrepancy between the functional and the binding data is presumably due to the poor binding affinity of fVa, the substrate of APC, for PC vesicles leading to the functional inactivity of PC vesicles (28Isaacs B.S.

Inhibition of the UPR pathway induces autodiploidization, and constitutive activation of UPR target genes suppresses this response. endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response unfolded protein response element wild-type fluorescence-activated cell sorting tunicamycin The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 is a membranous network structure where secretory and trans-membrane proteins are processed by disulfide (S-S) bond formation, glycosylation, folding, and oligomerization. Perturbation of ER function results in the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, because only properly folded proteins transit the secretory pathway. The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER induces a stress pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) that functions to reduce the ER stress situation (1Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1123-1211Google Scholar). The activated UPR results in an increased protein-folding capacity of the ER by up-regulating the transcription of genes encoding ER-resident molecular chaperones, enzymes that facilitate folding and assembly of proteins, and components of the protein degradative machinery (2Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-23Google Scholar, 3Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Google Scholar, 4Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, induction of UPR also reduces protein synthesis by down-regulating translation to reduce folding load for newly synthesized proteins. Growth arrest and/or the apoptotic cascade is also induced in response to the ER stress (5Larsson O. Carlberg M. Zetterberg A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 299-307Google Scholar, 6Perez-Sala D. Mollinedo F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 523-531Google Scholar, 7Dricu A. Carlberg M. Wang M. Larsson O. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 543-548Google Scholar). Experimentally, the UPR can be induced by inhibiting protein glycosylation with tunicamycin (TM) treatment or by preventing disulfide bond formation with the addition of reducing agents, such as ॆ-mercaptoethanol, to the growth medium. Glycosylation is the covalent addition of an oligosaccharide core structure to side-chain NH2 groups of selective asparagine residues in the protein. Many conditions, including overexpression of ER membrane proteins or mutant proteins, also induce the UPR (1Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1123-1211Google Scholar, 8Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Google Scholar). In yeast, the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates Ire1p, an ER-transmembrane serine/threonine kinase similar in structure to mammalian growth factor receptor kinases. The amino terminus of Ire1p, located in the ER lumen, serves as a sensor to detect the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. The carboxyl-terminal kinase and endoribonuclease domains function in the cytoplasm and/or nucleoplasm to activate downstream signaling events in the pathway (4Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Google Scholar,9Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Google Scholar). When activated, Ire1p oligomerizes and becomes trans-autophosphorylated by neighboring Ire1p molecules (10Shamu C.E. Walter P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3028-3039Google Scholar). Activated Ire1p triggers synthesis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor Hac1p (homology toATF/CREB) by cleaving a 252-nucleotide intron from unspliced HAC1u mRNA (u =uninduced) (11Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Google Scholar, 12Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Google Scholar). This intron attenuatesHAC1u mRNA translation by base-pairing interaction between the intron and the 5′-untranslated region (13Chapman R.E. Walter P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 850-859Google Scholar, 14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Google Scholar, 15Ruegsegger U. Leber J.H. Walter P. Cell. 2001; 107: 103-114Google Scholar). Although HAC1u mRNA is recruited into functional polyribosomes in the cytosol, the ribosomes stall during elongation and do not produce Hac1pu (13Chapman R.E. Walter P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 850-859Google Scholar, 14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Google Scholar). Upon ER stress, the RNase activity of Ire1p initiates the spliceosome-independent HAC1u mRNA splicing event (16Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Google Scholar, 17Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1802-1807Google Scholar). This reaction is similar to tRNA splicing, where the ends of the tRNA intron are cleaved independently (18Phizicky E.M. Greer C.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 31-34Google Scholar). Indeed, tRNA ligase, RLG1, involved in pre-tRNA splicing catalyzes ligation ofHAC1 mRNA resulting in the production ofHAC1i mRNA (i = UPR-induced), which is translatable. The unsplicedHAC1u mRNA is predicted to encode a protein of 230 amino acids (Hac1pu), with the 10 COOH-terminal amino acids encoded by the first part of the intron. Splicing of the intron replaces this 10-amino acid tail with a novel 18-amino acid tail encoded by the second exon, generating the 238-amino acid protein, Hac1pu. This change increases the transcriptional activation potential of Hac1pi (19Mori K. Ogawa N. Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4660-4665Google Scholar). Both Hac1pu and Hac1pi proteins have short half-lives of approximately 2 min (13Chapman R.E. Walter P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 850-859Google Scholar, 14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity of the UPR is not controlled by the difference in the stability of Hac1pu and Hac1pi (13Chapman R.E. Walter P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 850-859Google Scholar) but by regulated splicing of HAC1i mRNA. Constitutive expression of HAC1i mRNA results in unregulated expression of Hac1pi and the constitutive transcriptional induction of all known target genes. The majority of the UPR-induced genes share a common upstream cis-acting element in their promoters, the unfolded protein response element (UPRE), that is required to stimulate their transcription upon induction of the UPR (20Mori K. Sant A. Kohno K. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2583-2593Google Scholar, 21Mori K. Ogawa N. Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5450-5454Google Scholar). Hac1p is the transcription factor that binds to the UPRE to activate transcription of UPR target genes. Although the UPRE is necessary and sufficient for increased gene expression in response to the UPR, it is not required for basal level expression. All of the functional UPRE sequences identified contain a palindromic sequence that has, in most cases, a spacer of one C nucleotide. For example, the KAR2 UPRE contains the palindromic sequence, CAGCGTG. In addition to its role in the UPR, the Hac1p transcription factor also regulates cell differentiation in response to nutrient availability and functions as a positive regulator of the inositol biosynthetic pathway (24Schroder M. Chang J.S. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2962-2975Google Scholar, 25Cox J.S. Chapman R.E. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1805-1814Google Scholar). Free inositol is a precursor in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol, one of the major glycerophospholipids of the ER membrane in yeast. It has been proposed that Hac1p activates transcription of genes that are required for de novophospholipid synthesis including INO1 (encoding inositol-1-phosphate synthase), CHO1 (encoding phosphatidylserine synthase), and OPI3 (encoding phospholipid methyltransferase required for de novophosphatidylcholine synthesis) by antagonizing Opi1p repressor activity (25Cox J.S. Chapman R.E. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1805-1814Google Scholar). Indeed, hac1Δ cells are inositol auxotrophs, as a result of inability to induce transcription of the INO1 gene upon inositol starvation. The Kar2p/BiP protein is located in the lumen of the ER, where one of its functions is to facilitate the translocation of secretory precursors of a number of proteins (invertase, carboxypeptidase Y, and α-factor) into the lumen of the ER (26Vogel J.P. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1885-1895Google Scholar). Kar2p is also required for nuclear fusion during mating (27Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how this function relates to its translocation role. The failure in karyogamy results in division of the unfused nuclei mitotically in the zygote, which buds off mostly mononucleated haploid cells called cytoductants (28Conde J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3651-3655Google Scholar). Some of the cytoductants recovered from kar2 crosses, although displaying the phenotype of one of the parental haploid strains, become diploids by self-diploidization (29Polaina J. Adam A.C. del Castillo L. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 369-372Google Scholar). In addition, Kar2p inhibits UPR activation by binding to Ire1p and preventing its dimerization/oligomerization (30Okamura K. Kimata Y. Higashio H. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 445-450Google Scholar). Although the role for HAC1 in the UPR pathway has been extensively characterized, no defects relating to ploidy control have been associated with hac1 deficiency. In wild-type cells, an increase in ploidy occurs only as the inevitable conclusion to the mating process and results in the formation of alloploid (increase in ploidy arising from the combination of genetically distinct chromosome sets) a/α diploids. Mitotically growing cells maintain the same ploidy by precise regulation of chromosome duplication and separation. The fidelity of these processes is dependent on precise chromosome duplication and segregation (once-per-cell cycle replication), spindle pole body duplication and separation, nucleus migration, cytokinesis, etc. (31Weinreich M. Liang C. Chen H.H. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11211-11217Google Scholar, 32Stearns T. Cell. 2001; 105: 417-420Google Scholar, 33Bloom K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R326-R329Google Scholar). However, mutations conferring defects in these processes results in autopolyploidy (increase in ploidy that originates by the multiplication of one basic set of chromosomes) (34Chan C.S. Botstein D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 677-691Google Scholar, 35Heichman K.A. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 39-48Google Scholar). In this paper, we characterized the behavior ofhac1 mutants in the sporulation-proficient SK1 genetic background. Hac1p is required for the maintenance of ploidy. Inhibition of the UPR pathway results in autodiploidization and overexpression of Kar2p/BiP suppresses this phenotype, suggesting that functional UPR is required for ploidy maintenance. The genotypes and strain backgrounds of yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Liquid and solid media (36Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; : 194Google Scholar). For induction of the UPR pathway, tunicamycin (purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to liquid medium or solid medium (1 ॖg/ml). When necessary, early log phase cell cultures (A600 ≅ 0.1–0.2) were treated with TM for 4 h to induce the UPR. Standard genetic methods were used for mating, diploid selection, and tetrad analysis, unless otherwise indicated (36Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B.

Clones containing the genomicHAC1 locus were derived from YEp24-HAC1, which contains an 11.5-kb genomic Sau3AI fragment spanning theHAC1 locus and its flanking regions. pRS414-HAC1and pRS424-HAC1 were created by subcloning a HAC1containing a 2.46-kb StuI-NaeI fragment of YEp24-HAC1 into the SmaI site of theTRP1-based plasmids pRS414 and pRS424, respectively (39Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar,43Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Google Scholar). The integrity of the HAC1 gene was confirmed by sequencing, and functionality was verified by complementation of thehac1 phenotype. pRS416-hac1Δ1 was created by cloning the 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment of YEp24-HAC1into the EcoRI site of pRS416; the COOH-terminal 34 bp ofHAC1 including the stop codon derived from the second exon is not included on this plasmid. pRS416-hac1Δ2 was created by deleting the 0.45-kb SalI fragment from pRS416-hac1Δ1, which removes most of the HAC1coding region. pRS425-KAR2 was created by subcloning the 3.1-kb PvuII-NotIKAR2-containing fragment of pMR109 (a gift from Dr. Mark Rose, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ) into theSmaI-NotI sites of pRS425. Function on the gene was verified by its ability to complement the growth defect of akar2− ts allele (MS192) at 37 °C (data not shown). To create thehac1Δ100::URA3 null alleles, a 1.4-kbSpeI-NheI fragment containing the URA3gene (from YEp24) was subcloned into the SpeI site of pRS416-hac1Δ2 to create pRS416-hac1Δ100::URA3. Only the first 8 NH2-terminal amino acids of HAC1 can be expressed from this allele. To create thehac1Δ200::LEU2 mutant allele, a DNA fragment containing the LEU2 gene (a 2.2-kb genomic fragment of XhoI-SalI digest) was subcloned into theXhoI-SalI sites of the hac1 allele harbored on pRS416-hac1Δ2 to create pRS416-hac1Δ200::LEU2. Both the transcription and translation start sites as well as 787 of the coding region of HAC1 gene are absent from this allele. Two wild-type a/α diploid strains from different genetic backgrounds (LNY3, derived from the SK1 genetic background; LNY435, derived from the W303 genetic background) were transformed with linear DNA fragments containing eitherhac1Δ100::URA3 (2.6-kbKpnI-XbaI fragment of pRS416-hac1Δ100::URA3) orhac1Δ200::LEU2 (3.2-kbApaI-XbaI fragment of pRS416-hac1Δ200::LEU2), and gene replacement was selected for uracil or leucine prototrophy, respectively. Six independent transformants (three from each strain), in which one copy of HAC1 was replaced with eitherhac1Δ100::URA3 orhac1Δ200::LEU2, were sporulated and subjected to tetrad analysis. To create the ire1Δ100::TRP1 null allele, a 5-kb linear DNA fragment (EcoRI digest of pCS160, a gift from Dr. Peter Walter, University of California, San Francisco, CA), which contains 0.35 and 0.25 kb, respectively, of 5′- and 3′-IRE1 genomic sequences flanking both ends and the yeastTRP1-selectable marker, was used to perform a one-step gene replacement by transforming the diploid strain LNY3 (wild-type, SK1) to tryptophan prototrophy. The integrity of the gene replacement was confirmed by genomic PCR (data not shown). Theire1Δ100::TRP1 heterozygotes were sporulated and subjected to tetrad analysis on medium containing 30 ॖg/ml inositol, because ire1 mutants are inositol auxotrophs (40Nikawa J. Yamashita S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1441-1446Google Scholar). Quantitative ॆ-galactosidase assays were carried out by harvesting cultures grown to mid-log phase as described (41Stern M. Jensen R. Herskowitz I. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 853-868Google Scholar). Strains were grown overnight on YPD plates and then replica-plated to sporulation plates and incubated at 30 °C. To test sporulation ability of hac1 autodiploid cells,hac1 cells were transformed with plasmids that carrying the opposite MAT allele. LNY686 and LNY688 were transformed with pAV123 (carrying MATa) and pAV115 (carryingMATα), respectively. Transformants were selected on SC−Leu medium, sporulated, and dissected on YPD plate. The following 32P-labeled probes were made using the Random Prime labeling system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals): a 0.79-kbSpeI- HindIII fragment of HAC1, a 1.6-kb PCR fragment of KAR2 corresponding to bases 9–1645 of the coding region, an 1.1-kb PCR fragment of INO1corresponding to bases 265–1336 of the coding region, and a 0.46-kb PCR fragment of ACT1 corresponding to bases 974–1434 of the coding region. Autoradiographs were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Standard PCR methods were used. Primers used for PCR are: INO502 (5′-GGAATTATGCTCATTGGGTTAGGTG-3′) and INO302 (5′-ACATCAACTCACTGTAATACTCGTC-3′) for INO1 fragment amplification, KAR501 (5′-CAACAGACTAAGCG-3′) and KAR301 (5′-CGTTAGTGATGGTG-3′) for KAR2 fragment amplification, ACT974 (5′-CTTCGAACAAGAAATGC-3′) and ACT1924 (5′-AGAAACACTTGTGGTG-3′) for ACT1 fragment amplification, and HAC5′IN (5′-CAACTCGAGAAATGAATAC-3′) and HAC3′IN (5′-GTGTTCTTGTTCACTGTAG-3′) for HAC1 fragment amplification. All inserts were sequenced by the dideoxy method using the reagents and methods suggested by the Sequenase kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were fixed in 707 ethanol for 6 h at room temperature with rotation. Fixed cells were sequentially treated with 0.25 mg/ml RNase (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, for 12 h at 37 °C and 1.9 mg/ml pepsin (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C and then stained with 50 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in 180 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 190 mm NaCl, 70 mm MgCl2 for 30 min. Just before FACS analysis, cell suspensions were diluted 1:25 with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and sonicated for 1 min to break up clumps. Total fluorescence intensities were measured by quantitative flow cytometry using an Epics Profile II Cytometer (Coulter Electronics). 20,000 counts were read per sample, and the resulting DNA content was determined and plotted on log scale. To generate a hac1 null allele, one of the copies of HAC1 in the wild-type SK1 diploid LNY3 (Table I) was replaced with a hac1Δ100::URA3 allele (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡) (42Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Google Scholar). Sporulation and subsequent tetrad analysis produced four viable spores, with thehac1Δ100::URA3 disruption allele segregating 2:2. However, spores carrying thehac1Δ100::URA3 mutation cosegregated with slow growth, thus forming only small colonies on YPD medium after 4 days at 30 °C (Fig. 1A). Microscopic examination revealed that thehac1Δ100::URA3 mutant yeast were larger, were somewhat elongated, and contained large vacuoles compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1B). To verify that slow colony growth and increased cell size were a direct result of thehac1 deficiency, a wild-type HAC1 gene on a centromere-based plasmid pRS414-HAC1 was introduced into LNY542 (a/αhac1Δ100::URA3/+) (40Nikawa J. Yamashita S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1441-1446Google Scholar). After sporulation and tetrad analysis, we found that the growth rate and cell size of both wild-type and hac1 spore clones harboring pRS414-HAC1 were comparable, indicating that these phenotypes were a consequence of hac1 deficiency. Several lines of evidence indicate that this deletion was not a neomorphic allele. First, thehac1Δ100::URA3 allele removed most of the coding region including the entire DNA binding domain and leucine zipper, rendering it unlikely that any residual activity remained. Second, a second hac1Δ allele,hac1Δ200::LEU2 (LNY545, Table I), which extended the deleted region to remove both the initiator codon and the promoter, produced phenotypes identical to those conferred byhac1Δ100::URA3 (data not shown). Furthermore, both alleles were fully recessive to wild type, which is inconsistent with expression of a neomorphic mutation. Finally, we created hac1Δ100::URA3 strains in the W303 genetic background and found that these strains did not exhibit the SK-specific phenotypes, but were defective for the UPR (see below). To confirm that Hac1p activity was eliminated, we analyzed the SK1 and W303 hac1Δ100::URA3 stains for phenotypes known to be conferred by hac1 null mutations.hac1 mutants are inositol auxotrophs and are defective in the UPR. To monitor the UPR, we assayed for growth in the presence of tunicamycin (44Elbein A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1981; 6: 219-221Google Scholar). Whereas wild-type strains from both genetic backgrounds were able to form colonies on medium containing 1 ॖg/ml tunicamycin, hac1Δ100::URA3 mutants in either background did not grow (Fig.2A). Furthermore, tunicamycin-stimulated induction of a UPRE-dependent ॆ-galactosidase reporter gene was defective inhac1Δ100::URA3 mutants derived from both SK1 and W303 genetic backgrounds (data not shown). Wild-type W303 strains were inositol prototrophs; however, isogenichac1Δ100::URA3 mutants grew very poorly in the absence of inositol, as previously described (Fig.2B) (25Cox J.S. Chapman R.E. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1805-1814Google Scholar, 45Sugiyama M. Nikawa J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4985-4993Google Scholar). Surprisingly, wild-type SK1 strains were significantly compromised for growth in the absence of inositol. However, this limited growth capacity was completely abolished in the presence of hac1Δ100::URA3 (Fig.2B, top right). Thus, both W303 and SK1 hac1Δ100::URA3 strains are inositol auxotrophs. Northern blot analysis was used to directly monitor the UPR (Fig.2C). Under normal growth conditions, the unspliced form ofHAC1 mRNA was detectable in wild-type strains and the spliced form accumulated after UPR induction by tunicamycin treatment (11Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Google Scholar, 14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Google Scholar). As expected, HAC1-derived message was not detectable under any conditions in thehac1Δ100::URA3 mutants. Tunicamycin-induced expression of KAR2, a UPR target gene, was abolished in the hac1Δ100::URA3mutants compared with wild-type strains. Similarly, induction ofINO1 was defective in hac1 strains. The phenotypes and expression patterns observed in our hac1Δmutants demonstrate that these were indeed null alleles. In fact, this study also revealed that INO1 induction in wild-type SK1 strains is very weak compared with that in W303 strains, and may explain the poor growth of the SK1 strains in the absence of inositol. It is possible that the inositol auxotrophy inherent in SK1 strains may contribute to the slow colony growth and increased cell size associated with SK1 hac1Δ mutants. However, this is not likely because supplementing the medium with excess inositol did not suppress the phenotype in the SK1 background (data not shown). In addition, because both wild-type and hac1 mutant SK1 cells grow well in the medium containing inositol (Fig. 2B), inositol metabolism is likely not defective under these conditions. In addition, overexpression of Kar2p did not rescue the poor growth of wild-type SK1 strains in the absence of inositol (Fig. 2B,bottom). Therefore, it is unlikely that the phenotype we report here is synthetic phenotype of the UPR and inositol biosynthetic pathways. To further characterize the SK1 hac1Δ100::URA3mutants, we backcrossed the spore clones derived from tetrad analysis of LNY3 (+/+) and LNY542 (hac1Δ100::URA3/+). Tetrads derived from SK1 strains characteristically displayed high viability (997) and 2:2 segregation of all markers, as was the case for LNY3 (Table II, line 1). Likewise, diploid strains heterozygous forhac1Δ100::URA3 (LNY542) that were generated by one-step gene replacement also produced tetrads with four viable spores (Fig. 1A). A total of 55 tetrads were analyzed; 215 of the 220 spores were viable, and the heterozygous markers (hac1Δ100::URA3 andMAT) segregated 2:2, as expected (Table II, line 2). Unusual genetic behavior was observed, however, upon tetrad analysis on strains generated by cross of SK1hac1Δ100::URA3 spore clones to wild-type SK1 haploids (Table II, line 3). First, spore viability was poor; only 146 of the expected 460 spores dissected formed colonies (327), and viability was found to be independent of theHAC1 or MAT genotype. Furthermore, marker frequency within the viable spores was not random. We obtained an excess of prototrophs when scoring traits in which thehac1Δ1"
