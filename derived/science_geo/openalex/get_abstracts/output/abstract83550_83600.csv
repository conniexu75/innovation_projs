Three transformed lines (COS-1, -3, -7) were established and found to contain T antigen; retain complete permissiveness for lytic growth of SV40; support the replication of tsA209 virus at 40°C; and support the replication of pure populations of SV40 mutants with deletions in the early region. One of the lines (COS-1) contains a single integrated copy of the complete early region of SV40 DNA. These cells are possible hosts for the propagation of pure populations of recombinant SV40 viruses."

https://openalex.org/W1998162290,"Thirty minutes after inoculation of reovirus type 1 into the intestinal lumen of the mouse, viruses were found adhering to the surface of intestinal M cells but not other epithelial cells. Within 1 hour, viruses were seen in the M cell cytoplasm and were associated with mononuclear cells in the intercellular space adjacent to the M cell. These findings suggest that M cells are the site where reovirus penetrates the intestinal epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2095390159,"When the cytoskeletal framework is prepared from suspension-grown HeLa by extraction with nonionic detergent, all the polyribosomes are associated with the framework while 80% of tRNA and the major portion of monoribosomes as well as 75% of the cell proteins are found in the soluble fraction. The mRNA of polyribosomes is bound to the cytoskeleton and these molecules remain attached even after polyribosomes are disassembled in vivo prior to extraction. Although all actively translating message molecules are attached to the framework, about one quarter of the poly(A)+ mRNA is free of the framework. The binding of message to the skeleton may be obligatory for translation. Upon infection with VSV, all the viral polyribosomes but not all the viral messages of the infected cell are associated with the cytoskeletal framework. Pulse-chase labeling shows that VSV messages initially associate with the framework and then later detach and cease translation. The mRNA for the viral glycoprotein (G), known to translate only on ribosomes bound to endoplasmic reticulum, is also retained by the detergent-extracted structure. It appears that the protein substructure of the endoplasmic reticulum which binds polyribosomes is a component of the cytoskeletal framework."
https://openalex.org/W1991706339,"The distribution of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in fields of aggregating amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum was examined by a novel isotope dilution-fluorographic technique. Cellular cyclic AMP was visualized by its competition with exogenous 3H-labeled cyclic AMP for high-affinity binding sites on protein kinase immobilized on a Millipore filter used to blot the monolayer. The cyclic AMP was distributed in spiral or concentric circular wave patterns which centered on the foci of the aggregations. These patterns were correlated with those of cell shape change that propagate through the monolayers: cells in regions of high concentrations of cyclic AMP were elongated (presumably moving up a cyclic AMP gradient), whereas those in regions of low cyclic AMP concentrations were randomly directed. The highest cyclic AMP concentrations were about 10-6M. The widths of the regions of elevated cyclic AMP were about 0.3 to 1 millimeter which, assuming a wave velocity of 300 micrometers per minute, suggests that a cell signals for about 1 to 3 minutes. These observations support the hypothesis that the aggregation process in Dictyostelium is mediated by the periodic relay of cyclic AMP signals and suggest a simple scheme for the dynamics of the aggregation process."
https://openalex.org/W2135662596,"The synthetic peptide NH2-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-CONH2 (morphiceptin), which is the amide of a fragment of the milk protein beta-casein, has morphinelike activities and is highly specific for morphine (mu) receptors but not for enkephalin (delta) receptors. It is as active as morphine in the guinea pig ileum but much less active in the mouse and rat vas deferens. The discovery of this specific morphine receptor ligand substantiates the hypothesis of multiple opiate receptors. The ligand, which may be of physiological significance since a very similar, or identical, activity can be detected in enzymatic digests of beta-casein, may prove useful for further investigation of the functions of opiate receptor subtypes."

The inhibition was competitive in nature and the Ki was estimated to be 0.5 microM. The Hill coefficient for the reaction was 1.0 in the presence and absence of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate also enhanced inhibition of the enzyme by the allosteric inhibitor AMP.

https://openalex.org/W1999581164,"Polypeptide receptors on mammalian plasma membranes can be categorized on the basis of function. The binding of ligand by class I receptors results in changes in cell metabolism or behavior. Hormone-receptor interactions typify this group. The binding of ligand by class II receptors in ligand internalization. Although changes in cellular activity may result from metabolism of the internalized ligand, the interaction between ligand and class II receptor does not itself lead to alterations in cell behavior. Class II receptors include those for low-density lipoproteins and for alpha-macroglobulin-protease complexes. Although receptors within each category are chemically disparate, they show striking similarities in behavior. Analysis of the behavioral patterns of receptors in each category reveals insights into receptor physiology and allows for a prospective analysis of receptor characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1975928954,"Transposon Tn10 is 9300 bp in length, with 1400 bp inverted repeats at its ends. The inverted repeats are structurally intact IS-like sequences (Ross et al., 1979). Analysis of deletion mutants and structural variants of Tn10, reported below, shows that the two IS10 segments contain all of the Tn10-encoded genetic determinants, both sites and functions, that are required for transposition. Furthermore, the two repeats (IS10-Right and IS10-Left) are not functionally equivalent: IS10-Right is fully functional and is capable by itself of promoting normal levels of Tn10 transposition; IS10-Left functions only poorly by itself, promoting transposition at a very low level when IS10-Right is inactivated. Complementation analysis shows that IS10-Right encodes at least one function, required for Tn10 transposition, which can act in trans and which works at the ends of the element. Also, all of the sites specifically required for normal Tn10 transposition have been localized to the outermost 70 bp at each end of the element; there is no evidence that specific sites internal to the element play an essential role. Finally, Tn10 modulates its own transposition in such a way that transposition-defective point mutants, unlike deletion mutants, are not complemented by functions provided in trans; and wild-type Tn10, unlike deletion mutants, is not affected by functions provided in trans from a ""high hopper"" Tn10 element."
https://openalex.org/W1978526316,"We describe three related DNA alterations associated with transposon Tn10: precise excision of Tn10, nearly precise excision of Tn10 and precise excision of the nearly precise excision remnant. DNA sequence analysis shows that each of these alterations results in excision of all or part of the Tn10 element, and each involves specific repeat sequences at or near the ends of the element. Furthermore, all three events are structurally analogous: in each case, excision occurs between two short direct-repeat sequences, with resulting deletion of all intervening material plus one copy of the direct repeat; and in all three cases, the direct repeats involved occur at either end of an inverted repeat. Analysis of mutant Tn10 elements and characterization of bacterial host mutations suggest that all three types of excision events occur by pathways that are fundamentally distinct from the pathway(s) for Tn10-promoted transposition and other DNA rearrangements (deletions and inversions) actively promoted by the element. In addition, precise excision and nearly precise excision appear to occur by very closely related or identical pathways; and several lines of evidence suggest that the 1400 bp inverted repeats at the ends of Tn10 may play a structural role in both of these events. The third excision event appears to occur by yet another pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1600024407,"The F protein of paramyxoviruses is actively involved in the induction of membrane fusion. This fusion may be between viral and cellular membranes, as in the initiation of infection or in virus-induced lysis of erythrocytes, or between the plasma membranes of different cells. The F protein is activated by proteolytic cleavage to yield two disulfide-linked polypeptides (F1 and F2); however, its mechanism of action is not clear. In the present study, the conformations of the inactive, uncleaved precursor of glycoprotein (F0), and the active, cleaved form (F1,2) have been compared. The UV circular dichroism spectra of the two forms of the F protein indicate that cleavage results in a conformational change. Detergent-binding studies by velocity sedimentation analysis of Triton X-100-protein complexes revealed an increase in exposed hydrophobic surface of the protein on cleavage. The inactive F0 bound an estimated 27 molecules of Triton X-100/F polypeptide; these molecules are presumably bound to the hydrophobic region of the glycoprotein that anchors the spike-like protein in the virus membrane and that is common to both forms of F. The active form, F1,2, bound 67 molecules of Triton X-100. This increase in the number of detergent binding sites upon F protein activation indicates the presence of a hydrophobic region that is peculiar to the active form, and that may be of functional significance in the membrane fusion reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2040068413,"The inverted repeats of Tn5 are functionally different. One repeat codes for larger polypeptides, which are required for transposition. The other repeat has a better promoter for the neomycin resistance gene in the region of the repeat near the unique sequences. These dissimilarities are now shown to be caused by a single base pair difference. This change both creates a better promoter sequence and codes for part of a new UAA nonsense codon. Mutants in which the DNA sequence of a repeat is altered only at this base pair are shown to function like the opposite repeat. Furthermore, it is possible to suppress the UAA nonsense codon with an ochre suppressor, making the previously abbreviated polypeptides functional in transposition."
https://openalex.org/W1968805559,"The nucleotide sequences at the junctions between host cellular and integrated proviral DNA at the chicken endogenous retrovirus locus ev1 have been determined. These sequences have been compared with that of a DNA fragment presumed to contain the acceptor site for integration of the provirus at this locus. The results show that the integrated ev1 provirus contains a long terminal repeat (LTR) of 273 base pairs (bp). The left and right LTR are identical and contain sequences similar to proposed transcription control signals. In addition, there is a direct repeat of 6 bp of host DNA immediately flanking each provirus terminus. The nucleotide sequence of the fragment that contains the unoccupied acceptor site is identical to that which flanks the ev1 provirus, except that the 6 bp sequence occurs only once. We propose that the repeat was produced during integration by a mechanism similar to that of procaryotic and eucaryotic transposable genetic elements. This and other similarities in structure suggest a common evolution and mode of function for these movable genetic elements."
https://openalex.org/W2085129302,"The intermediate filament proteins, desmin and vimentin, are phosphorylated in skeletal muscle cells in vivo. Desmin kinase activities have been purified from mature chicken skeletal muscle and identified as the cAMP-dependent kinases. Chicken skeletal muscle contains two cAMP-dependent protein kinases which are similar to those of other tissues in their subunit composition and chromatographic behavior. The catalytic subunits purified from the two chicken cAMP-dependent kinases phosphorylate both desmin and vimentin in vitro, using cytoskeletal residues prepared from cultured myogenic cells as a substrate. Likewise, the purified catalytic subunits of the rabbit skeletal muscle and bovine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinases phosphorylate desmin and vimentin in vitro. Desmin and vimentin phosphorylation by the rabbit skeletal muscle catalytic subunit is inhibited by the addition of its regulatory subunit. This inhibition is reversed by the presence of cAMP in the reaction mixture. A small fraction of the vimentin phosphorylation is cAmP-independent. Tryptic peptide analysis of desmin phosphorylated in vivo shows two major phosphopeptides. Serine is the phosphorylated amino acid in both peptides. The same two peptides are phosphorylated in vitro by the bovine heart catalytic subunit, but additional peptides are also phosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W2088150538,"In the SV40-transformed mouse embryo fibroblast cell line SVT2/S, genomic rearrangements involving the SV40 DNA and flanking host sequences were identified by Southern blot hybridization using viral DNA as probe. No rearrangements of SV40 DNA integrated into nonpermissive mouse cells have been previously described. The standard arrangement found in the majority of subclones was mapped with 20 restriction enzymes, 10 of which cleave sites within the SV40 DNA. A single copy of a defective integrated viral genome is present, in which the late region is missing from about nucleotide 200 clockwise to about nucleotide 1750. The rest of the viral genome including the origin of replication and T antigen binding region is present and colinear with SV40 DNA, except for an internal repeat of about 1750 bp located between nucleotides 2750 and 4500. Rearrangements were found in 4 out of 20 random subclones of the parental SVT2/S cell line and 3 of the 4 continued to rearrange. The thioguanine-resistant cell line 281-1-4, derived from SVT2/S, remained stable on subculture but a chloramphenicol-resistant mutant, 107-6-4, derived from 281-1-4, was highly unstable. In 107-6-4, unique rearrangements were found in 6 of 31 subclones of a population that had undergone abut 25 doublings from a single-cell isolate. The high rate of rearrangement and the sporadic expression of rearrangement potential are characteristic of the transposable controlling elements discovered by McClintock."
https://openalex.org/W1969425389,"The mammary tumor induction genes Mtv-1 in mouse strain DBAf and Mtv-2 in strain GR control the complete expression of the endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). We have used a combination of genetic, biochemical and molecular biological methods to identify and correlate specific copies of the endogenous MMTV proviral genes with the biological properties of the tumor induction genes Mtv-1 and Mtv-2. These Mtv induction genes contain specific MMTV proviral information, as was concluded from restriction enzyme analysis and molecular hybridization of DNAs of congenic mouse strains and of progenitors of backcross populations. The congenic strains differed from the parental strains GR and 020 only in the Mtv-2 gene, one lacking the Mtv-2 gene (GR/Mtv-2-) and one having obtained this gene (020/Mtv-2+). The gain or loss coincided with two Eco RI cellular DNA fragments containing MMTV DNA information. Since Eco RI cuts the exogenous proviral variant of MMTV DNA once, we assume that these two cellular DNA fragments contain one MMTV provirus. The same cellular DNA fragments containing MMTV DNA information segregated together with MMTV expression in the offspring population of the backcross. In a similar backcross analysis of the induction gene Mtv-1 it was also demonstrated that the Mtv-1 gene comprises one MMTV provirus. These data indicate that Mtv induction genes contain specific but different MMTV proviral genes and that nly a limited number of the MMTV proviruses present in the cellular DNA is associated with the control of proviral expression."

The protein, termed G-substrate, is a monomer of 23,000 daltons. It is heterogeneous on isoelectric focusing, exhibiting three isoelectric forms over the pH range of 5.2-5.6 cGMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzes the incorporation of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of G-substrate, both into threonine residues. The protein has a high content of aspartate, glutamate, and proline.

Site-1 appears to be located 17 residues from the COOH terminus of the protein. Site 1 and site 2 are phosphorylated at similar rates by cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase. In contrast, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates site 1 4-fold more rapidly than site 2. A decapeptide sequence surrounding the phosphothreonine residues in G-substrate shows 5 identities with that surrounding the phosphothreonine residue in protein phosphatase inhibitor 1. Inhibitor 1, a specific substrate for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, also resembles G-substrate in its physical properties.

These genes are clustered within an 11 kb segment and are separated by spacers of 1.0-4.7 kb. Three of the genes were found to exhibit alternating polarities.

https://openalex.org/W2009379563,"Avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) is an acute leukemia virus which causes a myeloblastic leukemia in birds and transforms myeloid hematopoietic cells in vitro. We have analyzed RNA from AMV virions and from AMV-transformed producer and nonproducer cells by gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to chemically activated paper and hybridization to several complementary DNA (cDNA) probes. Using a cDNA probe specific for AMV, we identified two RNA species of 7.2 and 2.3 kb, which were present in all AMV-transformed cells and in all AMV virion preparations examined. The 7.2 kb species, which is presumably the genome of AMV, appears to contain the entire retroviral gag gene and at least part of the pol gene, but lacks much (or all) of the env gene. Thus AMV differs from other acute leukemia viruses described to date, since the latter have genomes of 5.5 to 5.6 kb, have only part of the gag gene and lack pol sequences. The smaller RNA does not contain gag-, pol- or env-specific nucleotide sequences but does carry nucleotide sequences from both the 5' and 3' termini of the genome, suggesting that it may be a subgenomic mRNA. Both the 7.2 and 2.3 kb species were associated with the 70S RNA complex in virions. These results suggest that AMV, unlike other acute leukemia viruses, does not express its transforming gene via a gag-related ""fusion"" protein but rather as a (so far unidentified) protein translated from a subgenomic mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2129127655,"Abstract The avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) and the avian myelocytomatosis virus 29 (MCV) induce the rapid appearance of tumors in birds. Although basically similar in nucleotide sequence, the genomes of MCV and AEV each contain a unique putative oncogene ( onc MCV and onc AEV ); each virus transforms at least two cell types in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that multiple functional domains may exist within onc AEV and onc MCV . Virus-coded polyproteins were previously detected in cells infected by MCV and AEV by the use of antibodies directed against virion proteins of the closely related avian sarcoma virus. However, AEV and MCV may encode as yet undetected proteins that do not react with antibodies directed against avian sarcoma virus proteins. mRNA was examined from MCV- and AEV-infected cells as a means of determining whether such additional proteins might exist. Our results indicate that MCV-infected cells contain only one RNA with sequences corresponding to onc MCV ; this 5.4 kb RNA corresponds in size to the MCV genome and probably encodes P110, the previously identified MCV polyprotein. The absence of any other MCV-specific mRNAs suggests that P110 (or presently unidentified derivatives) may be solely responsible for transformation by MCV. In contrast to our results with MCV, we found that AEV-infected fibroblasts and erythroblasts contain two species of RNA that anneal with cDNA corresponding to the majority of onc AEV . For several strains of AEV, the two intracellular viral RNAs have sizes of 5.3 and 3.5 kb, but in one instance have sizes 6.1 and 4.3 kb. We analyzed the distribution of onc AEV -specific sequences within the two AEV RNAs by hybridization with cDNAs corresponding to different sections of onc AEV . As expected, cDNAs from all regions of onc AEV anneal with the larger AEV RNA; this RNA probably encodes the AEV polyprotein. By contrast, hybridization results for the subgenomic RNA indicate that it contains the 3′ half of onc AEV and a leader sequence splied from the 5′ end of the viral genome. Our analyses of mRNA expression for two multipotential oncogenic retroviruses thus yield contrasting results. The existence of two intracellular AEV RNAs suggests that onc AEV may encode two distinct proteins. MCV, however, apparently encodes only a single viral protein. A third defective leukemia virus, the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV), generates a subgenomic 2.3 kb mRNA. We conclude that each of these three defective avian retroviruses employs a distint scheme for expression of its oncogenicity."

Each enzyme catalyzed the phosphorylation of 2.0-2.1 mol of 32P/mol of G-substrate, with phosphorylation occurring primarily at threonine residues. When phosphorylation was carried out in the simultaneous presence of the two enzymes, the stoichiometry increased only slightly, to a value of 2.4, suggesting that both enzymes phosphorylated the same two sites. Initial rate studies on the phosphorylation of G-substrate by cGMP-dependent protein kinase yielded a Km of 0.21 microM and a Vmax of 2.2 mumol/min/mg. Similar studies with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase yielded a Km of 5.8 microM and a Vmax of 2.3 mumol/min/mg. cGMP-dependent protein kinase thus exhibited a high degree of specificity towards this substrate which was apparently based on selective substrate binding rather than catalytic efficacy. The activity of cGMP-dependent protein kinase towards G-substrate was maximal at pH 7.5-8.0 and a Mg2+ concentration of 1-3 mM.

After heat shock, starved or growing cells reach the same maximum level of H1 phosphorylation, although the increase is more easily detected in starved cells because of their relatively low initial level of phosphorylation. In starved cells, stress-induced phosphorylation is rapid, involves a large percentage of the H1, occurs at multiple sites on the H1 molecule and is inhibited by cycloheximide.

Polyadenosine-diphosphoribose glycohydrolase activity was about 30% higher in cardiocyte nuclei of neonates than in adults, but the activity represents only 10% of the rate of the synthetase. Results demonstrate that polyadenosine-diphosphoribose metabolism in differentiated tissues is not directly related to the molecular size of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1547417076,"The restriction endonuclease from Escherichia coli K is a multifunctional protein which efficiently methylates heteroduplex DNA (one strand modified and one strand unmodified) in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), ATP, and Mg2+. The methylase activity is catalytic, and seems to modify different heteroduplex host specificity sites for E. coli K with equal efficiency. In the methylase reaction, both AdoMet and ATP (or its imido analog) act as allosteric effectors, but AdoMet also serves as a methyl donor. Preincubation of the enzyme with AdoMet eliminates the lag period observed in DNA methylation. The rate of enzyme activation was determined using the AdoMet analog Sinefungin. The result are consistent with the hypothesis that the early steps of AdoMet binding and enzyme activation are common to both restriction and modification reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1544191244,"The (Na+ and K+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K+)-ATPase) from canine kidney reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles showed an ATP-dependent, ouabain-inhibited uptake of 22Na+ in the absence of added K+. This transport occurred against a Na+ concentration gradient, was not affected by increasing the K+ concentration to 10 microM (four times the endogenous level), and could not be explained in terms of Na+in in equilibrium Na+out exchange. K+-independent transport occurred with a stoichiometry of 0.5 mol of Na+ per mol of ATP hydrolyzed as compared with 2.9 mol of Na+ per mol of ATP for K+-dependent transport."
https://openalex.org/W1495684632,"A topoisomerase activity was purified from mature ovaries and from nuclei of stage 6 oocytes of Xenopus laevis. From both preparations we obtained a single polypeptide chain having an estimated molecular weight of 67,000. The enzyme purified from ovaries is active in the presence of 150 mM monovalent cation, but its activity is more than 1 order of magnitude higher in the presence of 6 mM Mg2+; the enzyme purified from nuclei requires Mg2+ through all the steps of purification. Enucleated oocytes are devoid of topoisomerase activity but are able to convert the nuclear enzyme to a species active also in the presence of monovalent cations. The difference in ionic requirement between the nuclear topoisomerase and the enzyme purified from ovaries as well as the topoisomerases from other eukaryotic sources, which are most active in the presence of monovalent cations, may depend on the source of the enzyme and/or on the extraction procedure. Ovarian and nuclear topoisomerases catalyze relaxation of both negatively and positively superhelical DNA; the relaxed isomers produced in the presence of Mg2+ have a few positive superhelical turns."
https://openalex.org/W1594045527,"Abstract Four different repeated sequence elements have been found in cloned silk moth DNA, extending from 5700 base pairs upstream from the silk fibroin gene to 600 base pairs within its intervening sequence. Only 2 of the 12 overlapping restriction fragments examined, ranging from 164 to 1800 base pairs in length, do not contain a repeated sequence. The 830 base pairs adjoining the 5'-end of the fibroin gene hybridize with only one sequence in the Bombyx mori genome. Fibroin gene transcription initiates within this single-copy DNA at least 500 base pairs downstream from any repeated DNA sequence. The data show that repeated sequences comprise a major portion of the DNA flanking this developmentally regulated gene but not the DNA immediately 5' to it; that an intervening sequence can contain a repeated element; and that repeated sequences can be interspersed with one another as well as with single-copy DNA in a typical animal genome. In addition, filter transfer hybridization can be used to quantitate repetition frequency and sequence divergence and to distinguish patterns of repeated sequence organization."
https://openalex.org/W1672894336,"Abstract Two new purification procedures for human brain (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, EC 3.1.4.12), one without any detergent and the other with Triton X-100, are described. These procedures were more readily reproducible than the earlier one from this laboratory (Yamaguchi, S., and Suzuki, K. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 3805-3813) and yield preparations of higher purity with the final specific activity in the range of 50 to 100 mumol/h/mg of protein. Although activities of most lysosomal hydrolases tested were effectively eliminated, substantial activities of galactosylceramidase and alpha-mannosidase remained in the purified preparation. They could be separated on the analytical scale from the activity by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Sphingomyelinase A as we reported earlier appears to be aggregates of the (earlier designated as sphingomyelinase B). In Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, the enzyme showed an apparent molecular weight of 17 to 21 X 10(4). However, in the sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the presence of Triton X-100, it co-sedimented with bovine serum albumin (Mr = 67,000). Contrary to the earlier procedure, the new procedures eliminated the magnesium-dependent neutral activity from the acid preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1610968670,"In seeking a useful model to simulate some aspects of cytochrome P-450 reduction, acetylated cytochrome c was used as an electron acceptor for the NADPH-dependent adrenodoxin reductase plus adrenodoxin system. The modified cytochrome accepts electrons both directly from adrenodoxin and indirectly via superoxide anion. The rate of reduction of native cytochrome c increases linearly as the ratio of adrenodoxin to adrenodoxin reductase is increased, up to a maximal ratio of 1:1, above which the activity does not change. In contrast, little activity in acetylated cytochrome c reduction is seen at a 1:1 ratio of adrenodoxin to reductase, and activity is seen only as this ratio is exceeded, thus creating a lag in the adrenodoxin activity titration. Reduction of native cytochrome c is inhibited only at the high salt concentrations which lead to dissociation of the 1:1 adrenodoxin reductase-adrenodoxin complex. Similarly, reduction of acetylated cytochrome c is inhibited by high salt, but activity is also inhibited at low salt concentration. Acetylated cytochrome c thus provides an excellent model electron acceptor for steroidogenic electron transport, and studies support the role of adrenodoxin as a mobile electron shuttle between adrenodoxin reductase and a hemoprotein electron acceptor (either acetylated cytochrome c or cytochrome(s) P-450)."
https://openalex.org/W1498548231,"In the presence of optimal concentrations of Mg2+, rates of activated (gapped) DNA-directed DNA synthesis by purified mammalian type C retroviral DNA polymerases are stimulated greater than 10-fold by the polyamines spermine and spermidine. Such stimulation was not observed using either similar concentrations of the polyamines cadaverine or putrescine or exogenously provided salt or ammonium ions. Avian type C as well as mammalian type B and type D retroviral DNA polymerases, in contrast to the mammalian type C enzyme, were found to be relatively insensitive to spermine and spermidine stimulation. Kinetic analysis of the polyamine stimulation of activated DNA-directed DNA synthesis carried out using spermine and purified Rauscher leukemia virus DNA polymerase revealed at least two distinct mechanisms of activation of DNA synthesis. 1) At DNA concentrations below 2.5 micrograms/ml, spermine appears to interact with the enzyme-DNA complex in order to stimulate synthesis. 2) At DNA concentrations above 2.5 micrograms/ml, increased spermine stimulation is observed which appears to be due to its direct interaction with the activated DNA template resulting in either selective limitation of the formation of dead-end enzyme-DNA complexes or its ability to convert such nonproductive enzyme binding sites into productive sites for the initiation of synthetic activity. The addition of spermine to reaction mixtures was found to increase both the apparent Km and Vmax of the activated (gapped) DNA-directed reaction with regard to template concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2095061756,"We have investigated the organization and integration sites of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) DNA in NIH 3T3 mouse cells transformed by transfection with unintegrated and integrated donor RSV DNAs. RSV DNAs of different cell lines transformed by unintegrated donor DNA were flanked by different cellular DNA sequences, indicating that RSV DNA integrates at multiple sites during transfection. The RSV genomes of cells transformed by transfection were colinear with unintegrated RSV DNA, except that deletions within the terminal repeat units of RSV DNA were detected in some cell lines. These results suggested that the terminal repeat sequences of RSV DNA did not necessarily provide a specific integration site for viral DNA during transfection. In addition, cell lines transformed by integrated RSV DNAs contained both the RSV genomes and flanking cellular sequences of the parental cell lines, indicating that integration of integrated viral DNA during transfection occurred by recombinational events within flanking cellular DNA sequences rather than at the terminal of viral DNA. Integration of RSV DNA during transfection thus appears to differ from integration of RSV DNA in virus-infected cells, where the terminal repeat units of viral DNA provide a highly specific integration site. Integration of donor DNA during transfection of NIH 3T3 cells instead appears to proceed by a pathway which is nonspecific for both donor and recipient DNA sequences."
