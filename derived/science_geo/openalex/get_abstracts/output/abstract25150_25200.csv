https://openalex.org/W1597210981,"Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were chronically exposed to 5 nM tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). This resulted in the development of an insulin resistance based on the inability of insulin to stimulate hexose uptake. Western blot analysis for glucose transporter protein in isolated membrane fractions indicated a total depletion of GLUT4 protein (insulin-responsive glucose transporter) in cells chronically treated with TNF. Plasma membrane content of GLUT1 protein (growth-related glucose transporter) was similar in both control and TNF-treated cells; however, the GLUT1 content of the intracellular membrane compartment had decreased markedly after TNF treatment. Continuous exposure to TNF resulted in an 85-90% decrease in the mRNA content for both GLUT4 and 422 (aP2, a lipid binding protein) genes relative to age matched controls, whereas insulin receptor mRNA levels declined by at least 50%. This was preceded by a marked decrease in mRNA accumulation for C/EBP, a transcription factor proposed to control expression of both GLUT4 and 422. The specificity of these observations was demonstrated by the lack of an effect of the chronic TNF treatment on either beta-actin or lipoprotein lipase mRNA content. The decreased content of GLUT4 and C/EBP mRNA was judged to be regulated at least in part at the level of transcription, based on the results of transcription run-on assays. Thus, the lack of response to insulin appeared due to a suppression of GLUT4 expression as well as a decreased intracellular content of GLUT1."
https://openalex.org/W1586011497,"Recombinant calreticulin and discrete domains of calreticulin were expressed in Escherichia coli, using the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein system, and their Ca2+ binding properties were determined. Native calreticulin bound 1 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein with high affinity, and also bound approximately 20 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein with low affinity. Both Ca2+ binding sites were present in the recombinant calreticulin indicating that proper folding of the protein was achieved using this system. Calreticulin is structurally divided into three distinct domains: the N-domain encompassing the first 200 residues; the P-domain which is enriched in proline residues (residue 187-317); and the C-domain which covers the carboxyl-terminal quarter of the protein (residues 310-401), and contains a high concentration of acidic residues. These domains were expressed in E. coli, isolated, and purified, and their Ca2+ binding properties were analyzed. The C-domain bound approximately 18 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein with a dissociation constant of approximately 2 mM. The P-domain bound approximately 0.6-1 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein with a dissociation constant of approximately 10 microM. The P-domain and the C-domain, when expressed together as the P+C-domain, bound Ca2+ with both high affinity and low affinity, reminiscent of both full length recombinant calreticulin and native calreticulin. In contrast the N-domain, did not bind any detectable amount of 45Ca2+. We conclude that calreticulin has two quite distinct types of Ca2+ binding sites, and that these sites are in different structural regions of the molecule. The P-domain binds Ca2+ with high affinity and low capacity, whereas the C-domain binds Ca2+ with low affinity and high capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1570269678,"von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein that promotes platelet aggregation and stabilizes coagulation factor VIII in the plasma. vWF is also required for the stable accumulation of recombinant factor VIII secreted from cells in a heterologous expression system. In this report, we show that vWF can promote the in vitro reconstitution of factor VIII activity from dissociated heavy and light chains of factor VIII, suggesting that vWF may act to promote stable assembly of factor VIII subunits at the site of secretion. The structural requirements for vWF propeptide cleavage and for vWF multimerization in its binding and stabilization of factor VIII was examined using specifically altered recombinant vWF. The mutant vWF molecules were also assayed for their function in ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination mediated through the platelet receptor GPIb. Deletion of the vWF propeptide produced a dimeric vWF molecule that failed to mediate platelet agglutination, suggesting that multimerization is required for vWF to attain functional GPIb binding. This mature dimeric form of vWF, however, was fully capable of binding to and supporting stable secretion of factor VIII. A vWF mutant with an altered propeptide cleavage site formed large multimers of uncleaved pro-vWF that functioned in platelet agglutination. However, this noncleavage mutant neither bound to or supported stable accumulation of factor VIII. Analysis of the vWF propeptide, expressed independently, demonstrated that it could not bind factor VIII or stabilize its secretion. These results show that the dimeric mature vWF subunit is sufficient to bind and stabilize factor VIII and that the presence of uncleaved vWF propeptide inhibits both factor VIII binding and stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W1580740260,"We sought the mammalian neurofilament tail domain-specific kinase. Several well known kinases including cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, casein kinase I, and casein kinase II phosphorylated the high (NF-H) and middle molecular mass subunit (NF-M) of bovine neurofilaments, but they did not reduced the electrophoretic mobility of the dephosphorylated form of NF-M and NF-H by phosphorylation nor was the amount of phosphorylation increased by dephosphorylation of NF proteins, indicating that the phosphorylation sites by these kinases are not major in vivo phosphorylation sites at the tail domain. In contrast, cdc2 kinase phosphorylated specifically the dephosphorylated form of NF-H. 4 mol of phosphates were incorporated per mol of NF-H and this phosphorylation returned the electrophoretic mobility of the dephosphorylated form of NF-H to the position of the isolated, fully phosphorylated form of NF-H. Furthermore, the phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase dissociated the binding of dephosphorylated NF-H to microtubules. Phosphorylation sites were located at the carboxyl-terminal tail domain. The KSPXK motif, but not KSPXX, in the repetitive sequence was suggested to be the phosphorylation site by using synthetic peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1511138521,"In chicken immature erythrocytes, approximately 4% of the modifiable histone lysine sites participate in active acetylation. There are two categories of actively acetylated histone H4. Although both are acetylated at the same rate (t1/2 = 12 min), one is acetylated to the tetraacetylated form and is rapidly deacetylated (class 1), and the other is acetylated to mono- and diacetylated forms and is slowly deacetylated (class 2). We show that the chromatin distribution of the class 1 labeled tetraacetylated H4 species paralleled that of the transcriptionally active DNA sequences. For example, the chromatin fragments of the insoluble nuclear material contained 76% of the active DNA and 74% of the labeled tetraacetylated H4. Class 2 labeled acetylated H4 species were found in repressed chromatin and were enriched in active/competent gene-enriched chromatin fragments. The majority of the histone deacetylase activity (75-80%) was located with the insoluble residual nuclear material. Further, approximately 40-50% of the enzyme activity was associated with nuclear matrices prepared by two methods using high salt and intermediate/high salt extraction. Histone deacetylase was solubilized by extracting the nuclear matrices with high salt and 2-mercaptoethanol, a procedure that generates nuclear pore-lamina complexes. These results demonstrate that histone deacetylase is a component of the internal nuclear matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1546683674,"The 64-kDa pancreatic beta-cell autoantigen, which is a target of autoantibodies associated with early as well as progressive stages of beta-cell destruction, resulting in insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) in humans, has been identified as the gamma-aminobutyric acid-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. We have identified two autoantigenic forms of this protein in rat pancreatic beta-cells, a Mr 65,000 (GAD65) hydrophilic and soluble form of pI 6.9-7.1 and a Mr 64,000 (GAD64) component of pI 6.7. GAD64 is more abundant than GAD65 and has three distinct forms with regard to cellular compartment and hydrophobicity. A major portion of GAD64 is hydrophobic and firmly membrane-anchored and can only be released from membrane fractions by detergent. A second portion is hydrophobic but soluble or of a low membrane avidity, and a third minor portion is soluble and hydrophilic. All the GAD64 forms have identical pI and mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results of pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine are consistent with GAD64 being synthesized as a soluble protein that is processed into a firmly membrane-anchored form in a process which involves increases in hydrophobicity but no detectable changes in size or charge. All the GAD64 forms can be resolved into two isoforms, alpha and beta, which differ by approximately 1 kDa in mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but are identical with regard to all other parameters analyzed in this study. GAD65 has a shorter half-life than the GAD64 forms, remains hydrophilic and soluble, and does not resolve into isomers. Comparative analysis of the brain and beta-cell forms of GAD show that GAD65 and GAD64 in pancreatic beta-cells correspond to the larger and smaller forms of GAD in brain, respectively. The expression of different forms and the flexibility in subcellular localization of the GAD autoantigen in beta-cells may have implications for both its function and autoantigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1518778093,"The presence of glycolytic enzymes and a GLUT-1-type glucose transporter in rod and cone outer segments was determined by enzyme activity assays, glucose uptake measurements, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Enzyme activities of six glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, were found to be present in purified rod outer segment (ROS) preparations. Immunofluorescence microscopy of bovine and chicken retina sections labeled with monoclonal antibodies against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase have confirmed that these enzymes are present in rod and cone outer segments and not simply contaminants from the inner segments or other cells. Rod outer segments were also found to contain glucose transport activity as detected by 3-O-[14C]methylglucose uptake and exchange. The glucose transporter had a Km of 6.3 mM and a Vmax of 0.15 nmol of 3-O-methylglucose/s/mg of ROS membrane protein for net uptake and a Km of 29 mM and a Vmax of 1.06 nmol of 3-O-methylglucose/s/mg of ROS membrane protein for equilibrium exchange. These Km values for net uptake and equilibrium exchange are similar to values obtained for human red blood cells and are characteristic of GLUT-1-type glucose transporter. The transport was inhibited by both cytochalasin B and phloretin. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy using type-specific glucose transporter antibodies indicated that both rod and cone outer segment plasma membranes have a GLUT-1 glucose transporter of Mr 45K as found in red blood cells and brain microsomal membranes. Solid-phase radioimmune competitive inhibition studies indicated that rod outer segment plasma membranes contained 15% the number of glucose transporters found in human red blood cell membranes and had an estimated density of 400 glucose transporter per micron2 of plasma membrane. These studies support the view that outer segments can generate energy in the form of ATP and GTP by anaerobic glycolysis to supply at least some of the energy requirements for phototransduction and other metabolic processes."
https://openalex.org/W1670133851,"The precursor of the cysteine protease papain has been expressed and secreted as propapain from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus expressing a synthetic gene coding for prepropapain. This 39-kDa secreted propapain zymogen molecule is glycosylated and can be processed in vitro into an enzymatically active authentic papain molecule of 24.5 kDa (Vernet, T., Tessier, D.C., Richardson, C., Laliberte, F., Khouri, H. E., Bell, A. W., Storer, A. C., and Thomas, D. Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16661-16666). Recombinant propapain was stabilized with Hg2+ and purified to homogeneity using affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and ion-exchange chromatographic procedures. The maximum rate of processing in vitro was achieved at approximately pH 4.0, at a temperature of 65 degrees C and under reducing conditions. Precursor processing is inhibited by a variety of reversible and irreversible cysteine protease inhibitors but not by specific inhibitors of serine, metallo or acid proteases. Replacement by site-directed mutagenesis of the active site cysteine with a serine at position 25 also prevents processing. The inhibitor 125I-N-(2S,3S)-3-trans-hydroxycarbonyloxiran-2-carbonyl-L-tyrosine benzyl ester covalently labeled the wild type papain precursor, but not the C25S mutant, indicating that the active site is accessible to the inhibitor and is in a native conformation within the precursor. Based on biochemical and kinetic analyses of the activation and processing of propapain we have shown that the papain precursor is capable of autoproteolytic cleavage (intramolecular). Once free papain is released processing can then occur in trans (intermolecular)."
https://openalex.org/W1605481054,"Ribavirin enhances the anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity of 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddIno) in MT-4, CEM and peripheral blood lymphocyte cells. Ribavirin causes an increase in the levels of IMP, the presumed phosphate donor for the conversion of ddIno to ddIMP by 5'-nucleotidase. Consequently, ribavirin stimulates the conversion of ddIno to its antivirally active metabolite ddATP. Ribavirin also causes a marked depletion of the guanine nucleotide pools. The increase in IMP pool levels may result from (i) a direct inhibitory effect of ribavirin 5'-monophosphate on IMP dehydrogenase (which converts IMP to XMP) and (ii) an indirect inhibition of adenylosuccinate synthetase by the decreased GTP and dGTP pools (since GTP is an obligatory cofactor in the conversion of IMP to succinyl AMP). GTP depletion plays a key role in the accumulation of IMP and the resultant higher rate of ddIno phosphorylation to ddIMP and eventually ddATP. Our findings are in agreement with the observations that guanosine and 2'-deoxyguanosine, but not 2'-deoxyadenosine, reverse (i) the stimulatory effect of ribavirin on the anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity of ddIno and (ii) the accumulation of endogenous IMP pools as well as accumulation of [3H]IMP from exogenous [3H]hypoxanthine in ribavirin-treated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1493638,"Almost all modifications of the steroid binding domain of glucocorticoid receptors are known to cause a reduction or loss of steroid binding activity. Nonetheless, we now report that mutations of cysteine 656 of the rat receptor, which was previously suspected to be a crucial amino acid for the binding process, have produced receptors. These receptors displayed an increased affinity for glucocorticoid steroids and a decreased relative affinity for cross-reacting steroids such as progesterone and aldosterone. The increased in vitro affinity of the super receptors was maintained in a whole cell bioassay. These results indicate that additional modifications of the glucocorticoid receptor, and probably the other steroid receptors, may further increase the binding affinity and/or specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1544541054,"Human placenta glutathione transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) pi undergoes an oxidative inactivation which leads to the formation of an inactive enzymatic form which is homogeneous in several chromatographic and electrophoretic conditions. This process is pH dependent, and it occurs at appreciable rate in alkaline conditions and in the presence of metal ions. Dithiothreitol treatment completely restores the active form. -SH titration data and electrophoretic studies performed both on the oxidized and reduced forms indicate that one intrachain disulfide is formed, probably between the two faster reacting cysteinyl groups of each subunit. By the use of a specific fluorescent thiol reagent the disulfide forming cysteines have been identified as the 47th and 101th residues. The disulfide formation causes changes in the tertiary structure of this transferase as appears by CD, UV, and fluorometric analyses; evidences are provided that one or both tryptophanyl residues of each subunit together with a number of tyrosyl residues are exposed to a more hydrophilic environment in the oxidized form. Moreover, electrophoretic data indicate that the subunit of the oxidized enzyme has an apparent molecular mass lower than that of the reduced transferase, thereby confirming structural differences between these forms."
https://openalex.org/W1491140651,"We have demonstrated previously that the G protein alpha subunit Gz alpha (or Gx alpha) in human platelets is subject to phosphorylation by agents that activate protein kinase C, including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, thrombin, and the thromboxane A2 analog U46619. We examine here the site and selectivity of phosphorylation both in vitro using recombinant G protein alpha subunits and in situ using permeabilized and intact platelets. Protein kinase C catalyzes the rapid and nearly stoichiometric phosphorylation of recombinant Gz alpha, with the modification occurring preferentially for the GDP-bound form of the subunit. Under the same conditions, phosphorylation of recombinant Gi alpha 1, Gi alpha 2, Gi alpha 3, Gs alpha-S, Gs alpha-L, and Go alpha 1 was minimal. Phosphorylation of both rGz alpha and platelet Gz alpha occurs at a serine residue near the amino terminus. This conclusion is supported by phosphoamino acid analysis and the incorporation of radiolabel from [gamma-32P]ATP into the amino-terminal CNBr peptide (residues 2-53 of the encoded protein). One of the antisera used in this study (6354, directed toward residues 24-33) recognizes only the nonphosphorylated form of Gz alpha, providing strong evidence that Ser25 or Ser27 is the site of phosphorylation. Results obtained with 6354 also suggest that phorbol ester-promoted phosphorylation of Gz alpha approaches 1 mol of phosphate per mol of subunit in permeabilized platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1504779723,"GDP-L-fucose-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide alpha 1----6fucosyltransferase which catalyzes the transfer of fucose from GDP-L-fucose to the asparagine-linked N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine of N-linked glycoproteins has been purified 37,000-fold from cultured human skin fibroblasts. The Km values for the substrate asialoagalactotransferrin glycopeptide, and GDP-L-fucose were 66 and 4.2 microM, respectively. The Vmax was 1.4 mumols/mg/min. The key step in enzyme purification was affinity chromatography using the immobilized substrate asialoagalactotransferrin glycopeptide-CH-Sepharose. The affinity-purified enzyme had a minimum substrate requirement for a biantennary oligosaccharide with GlcNAc in terminal position, having a Km value of 55 microM. It was heretofore unexpected that the oligosaccharide would serve as substrate, since the site of enzyme activity is GlcNAc-1-linked to Asn. Although the presence of amino acids on this oligosaccharide enhanced the activity 3-fold, it is proposed that this may be the result of an alpha/beta anomeric mixture (2:1) of oligosaccharide used in these studies with only the beta anomer active as substrate. The implication is that the amino acid is required only to retain the beta anomeric position of the substrate. Removal of GlcNAc or addition of Gal to either the oligosaccharide or glycopeptide destroyed the ability to serve as substrates. In addition, di-N-acetylchitobiose, tri-N-acetylchitotriose and GlcNAc beta 1----Asn were nonpermissible substrates. This rigid substrate requirement is unique among fucosyltransferases thus far reported, since the natural substrates for the other enzymes may be substituted by one of several disaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1596712038,"Several toxins abolish cellular protein synthesis by attacking specific sites in 28 S RNA. One of these toxins, alpha-sarcin, is an RNase that also cleaves nonspecifically on the 3' side of purines in deproteinized RNA. Several other RNases were injected into Xenopus oocytes, examined for their ability to abolish protein synthesis, and compared with alpha-sarcin and ricin. Surprisingly, pancreatic RNase A or B abolished oocyte protein synthesis at concentrations (approximately 0.03 nM) comparable to, or lower than, the amount of alpha-sarcin (approximately 2 nM) or ricin (approximately 0.07 nM) required to abolish protein synthesis. RNases S and T1 only inhibited oocyte protein synthesis when used at concentrations approximately 10 x higher than RNase A whereas RNases C, T2, U2, and nuclease P1 required concentrations approximately 100 times higher than RNase A to abolish protein synthesis. There was a direct correlation between the degradation of oocyte RNA and the inhibition of protein synthesis. The RNase inhibitors RNasin and Inhibit-Ace injected into the oocyte both prevented RNase A from hydrolyzing oocyte rRNA and abolishing protein synthesis. Enzymatically inactive oxidized RNase A did not inhibit protein synthesis when injected into the oocyte. None of the RNases or alpha-sarcin abolished protein synthesis when added to oocyte extracellular medium. Angiogenin is a human plasma protein that induces blood vessel formation in chick embryos, has 35% amino acid identity with RNase A, and cleaves 18 S and 28 S RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (St. Clair, D. K., Rybak, S. M., Riordan, J. F. & Vallee, B. L. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 7263-7268, and references therein). Recombinant angiogenin injected into oocytes abolished protein synthesis, and this toxic effect was inhibited by RNasin but was not inhibited by Inhibit-Ace. Unlike RNase A and the other nucleases that hydrolyzed cellular rRNA, no cleavage of 18 or 28 S RNA by recombinant angiogenin was seen at concentrations 100 x greater than necessary to abolish protein synthesis. Recombinant angiogenin must selectively attack specific RNA(s) or another target in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1577532151,"Macrophages actively internalize macromolecules into endosomal vesicles containing proteases. The plant toxin, ricin A chain delivered into this pathway by receptor-mediated endocytosis, was found to be exquisitely sensitive to cleavage by these proteases. Proteolytic fragments of ricin A chain were generated within cells as early as 2-3 min after internalization. Toxin proteolysis was initiated in early endosomal vesicles, and transport to lysosomes was not required. As endosomes transit the cell, their lumenal pH drops from neutral to acidic. Previous studies in macrophages had suggested that endosomal proteolysis is dependent on vesicle acidification. Isolated endosomal vesicles containing ricin A chain catalyzed the cleavage of this protein in vitro; however, proteolysis was observed at both neutral and acidic pH. Experiments using isolated endosomes demonstrated that both cysteine and aspartyl proteases were responsible for the cleavage of ricin A chain. The cysteine protease, cathepsin B, catalyzed toxin proteolysis in endosomes between pH 4.5 and 7.0 while aspartyl protease activity was maximal below pH 5.5. Radiolabeling the lumenal contents of macrophage endosomes confirmed that both the cysteine protease, cathepsin B, and the aspartyl protease, cathepsin D, were present in these vesicles. These proteases were not present on the plasma membrane but were found in early endosomes indicating they are derived from an intracellular source. The presence of proteases with different pH optima in early endosomes suggests that processing in these vesicles may be regulated by changes in endosomal pH. This result represents an important difference in protein processing in endosomes versus lysosomes and provides new insights into the function of endosomal proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1523074507,"Where examined, cholesterol is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum; however, its precursor, zymosterol, is found mostly in the plasma membrane. The novel implication of these disparate findings is that zymosterol circulates within the cell. In tracing its movements, we have now established the following: (a) in human fibroblasts, zymosterol is converted to cholesterol solely in the rough ER. (b) Little or no zymosterol or cholesterol accumulates in the rough ER in vivo. (c) Newly synthesized zymosterol moves to the plasma membrane without a detectable lag and with a half-time of 9 min, about twice as fast as cholesterol. (d) The pool of radiolabeled zymosterol in the plasma membrane turns over rapidly, faster than does intracellular cholesterol. Thus, plasma membrane zymosterol is not stagnant. (e) [3H]Zymosterol pulsed into intact cells is initially found in the plasma membrane. It is rapidly internalized and is then converted to [3H] cholesterol. Half of the [3H]cholesterol produced returns to the plasma membrane within 30 min of the initial [3H]zymosterol pulse. (f) Nascent zymosterol accumulates in a buoyant sterol-rich intracellular membrane before it reaches the plasma membrane. This membrane also acquires nascent cholesterol, exogenous [3H]zymosterol pulsed into intact cells, and [3H]cholesterol synthesized from the exogenous [3H] zymosterol. These results suggest that at least one sterol moves rapidly and in both directions among the rough endoplasmic reticulum, a sterol-rich intracellular membrane bearing nascent cholesterol, and the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1492420382,"Active single-chain Fv molecules encoded by synthetic genes have been expressed and secreted to the periplasm of Escherichia coli using the ompA secretory signal. Four different constructs were developed to investigate the effects of peptide linker design and VL-VH orientation on expression, secretion, and binding to a Salmonella O-polysaccharide antigen. Peptide linker sequences derived from the elbow regions of the Fab molecule were used alone or in combination with the flexible (GGGGS)2 sequence. VL and VH domain order in the single chain molecules had a profound effect on the level of secretion but hardly influenced total expression levels, which were approximately 50 mg/liter, chiefly in the form of inclusion bodies. With VL in the NH2-terminal position, the amount of secreted product obtained was 2.4 mg/liter, but when VH occupied this position the yield was less than 5% of this value. Enzyme immunoassays of the four products showed domain order and linker sequence affected antigen binding by less than an order of magnitude. Attempts to express active Fv from dicistronic DNA were unsuccessful, but active Fv was obtained from single-chain Fv by enzymic cleavage at a site in the elbow linker peptide. The thermodynamic binding parameters of intact and cleaved single-chain Fvs determined by titration microcalorimetry were similar to those of bacterially produced Fab and mouse IgG."
https://openalex.org/W1665939804,"The zinc-binding subunits of yeast RNA polymerase A(I) and B(II) have been identified by a zinc-blotting technique. The two largest subunits of each enzyme (A190, A135, B220, and B150), as well as A12.2, A10, B44.5, B12.6, and B10, bind 65Zn(II). Predicted zinc-binding motifs have been noted in the NH2-terminal part of B220 and the COOH-terminal region of B150 subunits. Subdomains encompassing these motifs have been overproduced as MalE-fusion proteins and shown to retain zinc binding activity. Site-directed mutagenesis in the predicted metal-binding domain of B150 demonstrated its role in zinc binding. Mutations of cysteine residues C1163, C1166, C1182, and C1185 affected 65Zn2+ binding in vitro and caused a lethal or thermosensitive phenotype for growth. The ability to bind zinc is not sufficient for function since mutations in vicinal residues not affecting zinc binding were either lethal or thermosensitive. The role of zinc in RNA polymerase structure and function is discussed in the light of the present results."
https://openalex.org/W1590866948,"Photoinactivation of photosystem II (PSII) and light-dependent degradation of the reaction center II (RCII) protein D1 have been investigated in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants D6, AC208, and B4 deficient in cytochrome b6/f, plastocyanin, and photosystem I (PSI) activity, respectively. These mutants possess active PSII and reduce plastoquinone (PQ) but cannot oxidize plastoquinol (PQH2) via light-dependent reduction of NADP. In light-exposed cells a high ratio PQH2/PQ and a low turnover of PQ/PQH2 at the RCII-QB site are maintained. In all mutants photoinactivation of RCII was slower as compared to the wild-type (wt) cells, and D1 degradation was drastically decreased. The degradation of D1 was also lower in the wt cells under anaerobic conditions and presence of ascorbate, while raising the concentration of dissolved oxygen increased the degradation of the D1 protein in the AC208 mutant. Photoinactivation and light-dependent degradation of the D1 protein were drastically increased in the Scenedesmus obliquus LF-1 mutant cells altered in its PSII manganese binding and thus unable to reduce PQ using water as an electron donor. Diuron inhibited the light-dependent degradation of D1 protein in both the LF-1 mutant and wt cells. Based on these results we propose that availability of PQ at the QB site is required for (i) the photoinactivation process of the RCII acceptor side followed by inactivation of the donor side leading to the generation of harmful cation radicals (Z+, P680+, chlz+) which damage the D1 protein, and (ii) the accessibility of the cleavage site of the damaged D1 protein to proteolytic degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1656686735,"Caldesmon is a major actin-binding protein identified in smooth muscle and many non-muscle cells. It also interacts with calmodulin and a number of other acidic proteins. We have shown previously that the polypeptide stretch from Val629 to Ser666 near the C terminus contains a calmodulin binding site (Wang, C.-L. A., Wang, L.-W. C., Xu, S., Lu, R. C., Saavedra-Alanis, V., and Bryan, J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9166-9172). On the other hand, Bartegi et al. (Bartegi, A., Fattoum, A., Derancourt, J., and Kassab, R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15231-15238) reported a cyanogen bromide fragment beginning at Trp659 which is also capable of binding both calmodulin and actin. A comparison of the overlapping sequence between these two peptides suggests that this calmodulin binding site is localized in a 7-residue segment, 659Trp-Glu-Lys-Gly-Asn-Val-Phe665. We have chemically synthesized an 18-residue peptide (GS17C, from Gly651 to Ser667 with an added cysteine at the C terminus) that contains this segment. This peptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography and labeled with fluorescent probes at the terminal cysteine residue. We found that GS17C indeed binds calmodulin in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner (Kd = 8 x 10(-7) M) and appears to compete with caldesmon. Interestingly, this synthetic peptide also co-sediments with F-actin, binding to actin being displaceable by calmodulin, as in the case of the native caldesmon. But GS17C does not have any effect on the actomyosin ATPase activity, indicating that this peptide segment does not contain the inhibitory region."
https://openalex.org/W1508996756,"Meizothrombin and thrombin formation were quantitated during factor Xa-catalyzed activation of human prothrombin in reaction systems containing purified proteins and in plasma. In the purified system considerable amounts of meizothrombin accumulated when prothrombin was activated by factor Xa (with or without accessory components) under initial steady state conditions. The ratio of the rates of meizothrombin and thrombin formation was not influenced by variation of the pH, temperature, or ionic strength of the reaction medium. When 2 microM prothrombin was activated by the complete prothrombinase complex (factor Xa, factor Va, Ca2+, and phospholipid) 80-90% of the initially formed reaction product was meizothrombin. Lowering the prothrombin concentration from 2 to 0.03 microM caused a gradual decrease in the ratio of meizothrombin/thrombin formation from 5 to 0.6. When the phosphatidylserine content of the phospholipid vesicles was varied between 20 and 1 mol % and prothrombin activation was analyzed at 2 microM prothrombin the relative amount of meizothrombin formed decreased from 85 to 55%. With platelets, cephalin, or thromboplastin as procoagulant lipid, thrombin was the major reaction product and only 30-40% of the activation product was meizothrombin. We also analyzed complete time courses of prothrombin activation both with purified proteins and in plasma. In reaction systems with purified proteins substantial amounts of meizothrombin accumulated under a wide variety of experimental conditions. However, little or no meizothrombin was detected in plasma in which coagulation was initiated via the extrinsic pathway with thromboplastin or via the intrinsic pathway with kaolin plus phospholipid (cephalin, platelets, or phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles). Thus, thrombin was the only active prothrombin activation product that accumulated during ex vivo coagulation experiments in plasma."

Control and 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate-treated myocytes demonstrated a slow rate of growth as measured by the protein/DNA ratio and cell area. In contrast, treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated protein accumulation by 34%, while cell area was increased by 68% over control myocytes after 72 h. RNA content in PMA-treated myocytes was 33% higher than in control cells and 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate-treated cells after 72 h. Membrane-associated protein kinase C activity was transiently increased after PMA treatment but returned to normal by 48 h. Cytosolic protein kinase C activity was not significantly altered by PMA. Membrane-associated and cytosolic protein kinase C activities were not altered by 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate. Protein kinase C activity, RNA polymerase I activity, and the transcriptional rate of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were increased in nuclei isolated from PMA-treated cells. However, consistent with a high rate of processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA), the pool size of pre-rRNA relative to the 28 S rRNA was unaltered by PMA treatment. These data demonstrated that PMA-induced hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes was due to an increase in the capacity for protein synthesis (rRNA), and suggest that this results from protein kinase C mediated increase in the rate of transcription of rDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1559216026,"Two previously described sponge cDNAs, EmC4 and C23, respectively encoding a short chain collagen and a fibrillar collagen, were used to characterize collagen gene families in a freshwater sponge. EmC4 detected several clones when used to screen a cDNA library. Two overlapping clones, EmC13 1 and 2, were sequenced and appeared highly homologous to EmC4. Contrarily to C23, EmC4 hybridized with 10-12 fragments of genomic DNA digested with restriction endonucleases and detected 10 times more positive clones than C23 when used to screen a genomic library. The genomic clone G41 contained two closely related genes, COLNF13, corresponding to EmC13 and COLNF6. Partial characterization of COLNF13 revealed two partial exons and four complete exons of 153, 219, 207, and 144 base pairs, with split glycine codons at their boundaries. The deduced encoded protein is a short chain collagen containing two uninterrupted collagenous domains of 66 and 171 amino acids and non-collagenous domains. A characterized 207-base pair exon of COLNF6 is 77% identical with the comparable COLNF13 exon. In situ hybridization using EmC4 cDNA and electron microscopy suggested that the cells expressing these genes were secreting spongin, a non-fibrillar, surface collagen of these sponges."
https://openalex.org/W1490884960,"Abstract Rainbow trout sperm contained almost exclusively monoanionic ganglioside fraction as a major acidic glycosphingolipid. Two monoacidic gangliosides were isolated and purified in this study and designated as sperm ganglioside 1 and 2 (sg-1 and sg-2). The two gangliosides, sg-1 and sg-2, contained the same neutral sugars, galactose and glucose in molar ratio of 1:1 and no GalNAc except for the presence of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (NeuAc) in sg-1 and deaminated neuraminic acid (KDN; 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid) in sg-2. The complete structures of these gangliosides were determined by a combination of methylation analysis, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, 400-MHz one- and two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fatty acid analysis, and endoglycoceramidase digestion NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----Cer sg-1 [(NeuAc)GM3] KDN alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----Cer sg-2 [(KDN)GM3] where, for both sg-1 and sg-2, the ceramide moieties (Cer) were found to be made up of 4-sphingenine and mainly C16:0 fatty acid (palmitate; 95%) with a minor amount of C24:1 fatty acyl chain (nervonate, 5%). The structure of sg-2 is novel and represents the first example of a new class of gangliosides, i.e. KDN-gangliosides."
https://openalex.org/W1543169898,"All-trans-retinoic acid, an endogenous morphogen, induced neuronal differentiation of P19 murine embryonal carcinoma cells. Peak differentiation, as judged by the elaboration of neuronal processes, occurred 8 days after exposure of the cells to 0.5 mM retinoic acid, a concentration known to induce neuronal differentiation. An examination of the expression of the extracellular matrix receptors, integrins, during this retinoic acid-induced differentiation period, demonstrated a specific and strong induction of expression of two polypeptides (130 and 115 kDa) immunoprecipitated with an anti-human vitronectin receptor antiserum. The expression of a 90-kDa polypeptide, also immunoprecipitating with this antiserum was induced as well, but to a much smaller extent. The expression of a 96-kDa polypeptide immunoprecipitated by this antiserum and present in the untreated cells was not induced by retinoic acid. The increase in the expression of these polypeptides paralleled the neuronal differentiation of the P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. The expression of these integrins was not induced in a variant of the P19 cells, P19RAC65, which are resistant to differentiation induction by retinoic acid. Utilizing integrin subunit-specific anti-cytoplasmic peptide antibodies together with immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, the 130- and 115-kDa polypeptides were identified as the integrin alpha v and beta 1 subunits, respectively. The 90-kDa polypeptide, also induced by retinoic acid, was identified as beta 3, whereas the identity of the uninduced 96-kDa polypeptide remains unclear as yet. Peptide map analysis of deglycosylated polypeptides demonstrated that the 90- and 96-kDa polypeptides are distinct proteins and that the 115-kDa polypeptides immunoprecipitated with either anti-alpha v or anti-beta 1 antibodies are identical, further establishing that the 115-kDa polypeptide associating with alpha v is beta 1. The retinoic acid-induced expression of beta 1 occurred at the level of mRNA expression which also paralleled neuronal differentiation, but peaked slightly ahead of the cell surface expression of beta 1. The expression of other beta 1-associated alpha subunits was not induced by retinoic acid in these cells. These data demonstrate that retinoic acid strongly induces the expression of the integrin heterodimer alpha v beta 1 and also, to a smaller extent, the expression of alpha v beta 3. The retinoic acid-induced, high level surface expression of the alpha v beta 1 heterodimer is tightly correlated with the induction of neuronal differentiation by retinoic acid. This finding suggests an important role for the alpha v beta 1 heterodimer in the neuronal differentiation process."
https://openalex.org/W1482407471,"The human beta-amyloid protein is deposited in senile plaques and in the cerebro-vasculature of people with Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome. The precise role of beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease pathology is presently unknown. To study the properties of beta-amyloid in vivo, we generated transgenic mice that harbor the gene for the carboxyl-terminal 100 amino acids of the human amyloid precursor protein, beginning with the beta-amyloid region, under control of the JC viral early region promoter. The mRNA is expressed exclusively in brain tissue. Further, we demonstrate increased levels of beta-amyloid immunoreactivity on fixed brain tissue. These animals will be useful as a model to study beta-amyloid deposition and its consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1665596665,"We have shown previously that the lipophilic photoreagent 3-(trifluoromethyl)3-m-([125I]iodophenyl)-diazirine ([125I]TID) photolabels all four subunits of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and that greater than 70% of this photoincorporation is inhibited by cholinergic agonists and some noncompetitive antagonists, including histrionicotoxin (HTX), but not phencyclidine (PCP; White, B.H., and Cohen, J.B. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 8741-8751). We have now examined the effects of nonradioactive TID on (a) AChR photoincorporation of [125I]TID, (b) AChR-mediated ion transport, and (c) AChR binding of several cholinergic ligands. We find that TID inhibits [125I]TID photoincorporation into the AChR to the same extent as carbamylcholine. The saturable component of [125I]TID photolabeling is half-maximal at 4 microM [125I]TID with 0.5 mol specifically incorporated per mol of AChR after 30 min photolysis with 60 microM [125I]TID. Repeated labeling of membranes at a fixed [125I]TID concentration gave results consistent with a maximal incorporation of one [125I]TID molecule per AChR. Nonradioactive TID also noncompetitively inhibits agonist-stimulated 22Na+ efflux from Torpedo vesicles with an IC50 of 1 microM. Furthermore, TID inhibits allosterically the binding of [3H]HTX, decreasing its affinity for the AChR 5-fold both in the presence and absence of agonist. In contrast, TID has little effect on [3H]PCP binding in the absence of agonist but completely inhibits it in the presence of agonist. TID enhances the cooperativity of [3H]nicotine binding. [125I]TID is thus a photoaffinity label for a novel noncompetitive antagonist binding site on the AChR that is linked allosterically to the binding sites of both agonists and other noncompetitive antagonists. The [125I]TID site is presumably located within the central pore of the AChR."
https://openalex.org/W1566419949,We have identified and characterized a pair of negative regulatory elements far upstream of the transcription start site of the human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) gene. Transfection of various types of cultured cells with a fusion plasmid containing 4.7 kilobase pairs of the 5'-flanking portion of the hPTH gene linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-coding sequence generated only 10% of the CAT activity of a plasmid containing 684 base pairs of the 5'-flanking region of the hPTH gene. Deletion analyses reveal that there are at least two separate upstream DNA elements in the hPTH gene responsible for the negative regulation. We find that these cultured cells possess nuclear factors which specifically bind to several short DNA sequences within these elements and that these sequences can suppress transcription of the hPTH gene.
https://openalex.org/W1602279263,"The origin of reaction and substrate specificity and the control of activity by protein-protein interaction are investigated using the tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex from Salmonella typhimurium. We have compared some spectroscopic and kinetic properties of the wild type beta subunit and five mutant forms of the beta subunit that have altered catalytic properties. These mutant enzymes, which were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis, have single amino acid replacements in either the active site or in the wall of a tunnel that extends from the active site of the alpha subunit to the active site of the beta subunit in the alpha 2 beta 2 complex. We find that the mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complexes have altered reaction and substrate specificity in beta-elimination and beta-replacement reactions with L-serine and with beta-chloro-L-alanine. Moreover, the mutant enzymes, unlike the wild type alpha 2 beta 2 complex, undergo irreversible substrate-induced inactivation. The mechanism of inactivation appears to be analogous to that first demonstrated by Metzler's group for inhibition of two other pyridoxal phosphate enzymes. Alkaline treatment of the inactivated enzyme yields apoenzyme and a previously described pyridoxal phosphate derivative. We demonstrate for the first time that enzymatic activity can be recovered by addition of pyridoxal phosphate following alkaline treatment. We conclude that the wild type and mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complexes differ in the way they process the amino acrylate intermediate. We suggest that the wild type beta subunit undergoes a conformational change upon association with the alpha subunit that alters the reaction specificity and that the mutant beta subunits do not undergo the same conformational change upon subunit association."

(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 3361-3364). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that HBV surface antigen was expressed by the hepatocytes in vivo. On successive injections of the HBsAg genes, the antibody to HBV surface polypeptides was produced in the rats, and characteristic pathological changes of lymphocytic focal necrosis and denaturation of hepatic cells were observed in the liver of all the rats. We conclude that hepatitis is caused by the direct injection of HBsAg genes."
https://openalex.org/W1586167221,"Tissue factor, a 45-kilodalton membrane glycoprotein, is an essential cofactor for the plasma serine protease factor VII which activates factor X in the first step of the extrinsic coagulation cascade. Two adjacent lysine residues (numbers 165 and 166) were identified in the extracytoplasmic domain of tissue factor that are crucial for function. Site-directed mutagenesis of both lysines to alanines results in complete loss of activity. Mutation of either lysine alone results in a molecule which is much more sensitive to the phospholipid composition of the activating surface than the wild-type molecule. It is postulated that interactions between the extracytoplasmic domain of tissue factor and the membrane surface are necessary for bound factor VII or VIIa to assume a conformation capable of efficient catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1554380657,"Abstract The crystal structure of calmodulin (Mr 16,700, 148 residues) from Drosophila melanogaster as expressed in a bacterial system has been determined and refined at 2.2-A resolution. Starting with the structure of mammalian calmodulin, we produced an extensively refitted and refined model with a conventional crystallographic R value of 0.197 for the 5,239 reflections (F greater than or equal to 2 sigma (F)) within the 10.0-2.2-A resolution range. The model includes 1,164 protein atoms, 4 calcium ions, and 78 water molecules and has root mean square deviations from standard values of 0.018 A for bond lengths and 0.043 A for angle distances. The overall structure is similar to mammalian calmodulin, with a seven-turn central helix connecting the two calcium-binding domains. The dumb-bell shaped molecule contains seven alpha-helices and four EF hand calcium-binding sites. Although the amino acid sequences of mammalian and Drosophila calmodulins differ by only three conservative amino acid changes, the refined model reveals a number of significant differences between the two structures. Superimposition of the structures yields a root mean square deviation of 1.22 A for the 1,120 equivalent atoms. The calcium-binding domains have a root mean square deviation of 0.85 A for the 353 equivalent atoms. There are also differences in the amino terminus, the bend of the central alpha-helix, and the orientations of some of the side chains."
https://openalex.org/W1606940724,"Whether the Na(2+)-independent Ca2+ efflux mechanism of liver mitochondria is a Ca2+/2H+ exchanger and whether this exchanger is a passive mechanism have been controversial since shortly after the discovery of this mechanism. Here, a new approach to determining if the mechanism is passive is developed based on the energy available to a passive Ca2+/2H+ exchanger. Conditions are identified in which the Na(+)-independent Ca2+ efflux mechanism transports Ca2+ out of mitochondria against a Ca2+ gradient many times greater than that possible for a passive Ca2+/2H+ exchanger, thus ruling this out as a possible mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1573606648,"Abnormal tau proteins (PHF-tau) were isolated from Alzheimer's disease brains by treatment of paired helical filament enriched-fractions with perchloric acid and boiling of the acid precipitable fraction with beta-mercaptoethanol. These proteins were purified further by a second perchloric acid treatment. The purified PHF-tau proteins were soluble in buffers devoid of sodium dodecyl sulfate. However, they were similar to the abnormal tau extracted from paired helical filaments with sodium dodecyl sulfate, also named A68, in molecular mass (68, 64, and 60 kDa), isoelectric point (pI 5.5-6.5), reactivity with anti-tau antibodies, and in requirement for alkaline phosphatase treatment to bind the Tau-1 antibody. Compared to normal tau, the soluble PHF-tau contained 100% more glycine and 35% less lysine residue. The results suggest that besides phosphorylation other types of modification may be involved in differentiating PHF-tau from normal tau."
https://openalex.org/W2100869031,"Arginase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has long been known to be a metal ion-requiring enzyme as it requires heating at 45 degrees C in the presence of 10 mM Mn2+ for catalytic activation. Metals are also thought to play a structural role in the enzyme, but the identity of the structural metal and its precise structural role have not been defined. Analysis of the metal ions that bind to yeast arginase by atomic absorption spectroscopy reveals that there is a weakly associated Mn2+ that binds to the trimeric enzyme with a stoichiometry of 1.04 +/- 0.05 mol of Mn2+ bound per subunit and an apparent K'D value of 26 microM at pH 7.0 and 4 degrees C. A more tightly associated Zn2+ ion can only be removed by dialysis against chelating agents. In occasional preparations, this site contained some Mn2+; however, Zn2+ and Mn2+ together bind to high affinity sites with a stoichiometry of 1.14 +/- 0.25/mol of subunit. Both the loosely associated catalytic Mn2+ ion and the more tightly associated structural Zn2+ ion confer stability to the enzyme. Removal of the weakly bound Mn2+ ion results in a 3 degree C decrease in the midpoint of the thermal transition (T 1/2) (from 57 by 54 degrees C) as monitored by UV difference absorption spectroscopy. Removal of the tightly bound Zn2+ ion produces a 19 degrees C decrease in T 1/2 (to 38 degrees C). Similar results are obtained by circular dichroism measurements. When the Zn2+ ion is removed, the steady-state fluorescence intensity increases 100% as compared to the holoenzyme, with a shift in the emission maximum from 337 to 352 nm. This suggests that in the folded trimeric metalloenzyme, the tryptophan fluorescence is quenched and that upon removal of the structural metal, the quenching is relieved as tryptophan residues become exposed to more polar environments. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments performed after dialysis of the enzyme against EDTA demonstrate that arginase exists in a reversible monomer-trimer equilibrium, in the absence of metal ions, with a KD value of 5.05 x 10(-11) M2. In contrast, the native enzyme exists as a trimer with no evidence of dissociation when Mn2+ and Zn2+ are present (Eisenstein, E., Duong, L.T., Ornberg, R. L., Osborne, J.C., Jr., and Hensley, P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12814-12819). In summary, the study presented here demonstrates that binding of a weakly bound Mn2+ ion confers catalytic activity. In contrast, binding of a more tightly associated Zn2+ ion confers substantial stability to the tertiary and quaternary structure of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2170676588,"Heme formation in the erythron is subject to end product regulation by negative feedback, but the exact point of metabolic control in human erythroid cells is unknown. To investigate the mode of action of heme on its own formation, the effects of micromolar concentrations of hemin on de novo synthesis of protoporphyrin IX and delta-aminolevulinate (delta-ALA) by intact human reticulocytes were examined in the presence of 1 mM alpha,alpha'-bipyridyl and 200 microM 4,6-dioxoheptanoate to block their further conversion by ferrochelatase or delta-ALA dehydrase, respectively. At final concentrations (25-40 microM), hemin, which is known to reduce incorporation of [2-14C]glycine into cellular heme, significantly inhibited formation of protoporphyrin IX and total delta-aminolevulinate in situ by these cells. Since synthesis of the first committed precursor, delta-aminolevulinate, as well as protoporphyrin (which is derived from it) were diminished, the effects of hemin on delta-aminolevulinate synthase (EC 2.3.1.37) were studied. Hemin, at concentrations up to 40 microM, had no direct effect on enzymatic activity, as measured with [5-14C] alpha-ketoglutarate (in hypotonically lysed cells) or [1,4-14C]succinyl coenzyme A (in deoxycholate lysates), even after preincubation. However, when intact human reticulocytes were incubated with hemin before assay for delta-ALA synthase, there was a rapid, concentration-dependent reduction in enzymatic activity (mean 42 and 23% inhibition after 60 min for these two substrates, respectively). Hemin had no effect on steady-state levels of delta-ALA synthase mRNA, as determined by Northern blot hybridization using an erythroid-specific human cDNA probe. Thus, a mechanism for inducing feedback inhibition of the tetrapyrrole pathway exists in human erythroid cells. It controls formation of the first committed precursor of protoporphyrin IX, delta-aminolevulinate, and hence regulates heme biosynthesis by limiting the availability of the porphyrin, rather than the metal substrate for the ferrochelatase reaction. Hemin interacts with constituents of the intact reticulocyte significantly to reduce delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase activity by an indirect cellular process that does not influence the abundance of erythroid-specific synthase mRNA but may either inhibit its ribosomal translation in an unknown manner or promote degradation of the enzyme itself by specific proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1594882227,The dependence of the flux in the alcohol-degrading pathway on the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase was investigated in Drosophila larvae. Third-instar larvae were supplied with [2-13C]ethanol as a dietary carbon source. Specific carbon enrichments in de novo synthesized fatty acids were determined in vitro by means of 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Carbon fluxes deduced from these enrichment patterns were correlated with the in vitro alcohol dehydrogenase activities in three different Adh genotypes in seven different strains. The flux control coefficient for alcohol dehydrogenase was shown to be approximately 1.0. This indicates that the alcohol dehydrogenase gene-enzyme system in Drosophila larvae can be a major target of natural selection.
https://openalex.org/W1588301398,We have explored the template and factor requirements for in vitro transcription of the GC-rich promoter of the murine adenosine deaminase gene. The core promoter consists of an A-rich sequence (TAAAAAA) 27 base pairs upstream of the initiation site which binds transcription factor IID (TFIID) and a high affinity Sp1 binding site located 27 base pairs further upstream. Multiple upstream elements increased core promoter activity 20-fold and correspond to protected regions in DNase I footprinting assays with purified Sp1 protein. Internal deletion of the TA6 element alone eliminated transcription in spite of the presence of all other promoter elements including four Sp1 binding sites. Recombinant human TFIID supported weak basal transcription in heat-treated nuclear extracts whereas a partially purified TFIID fraction from HeLa cells reconstituted a maximal level of transcription. Inclusion of 12 base pairs immediately adjacent to the proximal Sp1 site resulted in a 5-fold boost in transcriptional activity and corresponds to a second Sp1 binding site. These results serve as a basis for further exploration of the factors involved in the developmental and selective high level tissue expression of the murine adenosine deaminase gene.
https://openalex.org/W1516191286,"Retinoic acid (RA), the natural acid derivative of vitamin A, can induce the differentiation of some cell lines, such as the murine P19 teratocarcinoma cell line. RA can alter the expression of specific genes and the level of the corresponding protein. This report describes the effect of RA on the level of the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) mRNA and protein in P19 teratocarcinoma cells. RA caused a rapid, dose-dependent, and protein synthesis-dependent induction of ALP activity. The increased enzyme activity was detected 4 h after initiation of treatment and maximum induction of ALP activity required 48 h of RA exposure. Increased enzymatic activity was coincidental with increased levels of both a 67-kDa ALP protein and ALP mRNA. By Northern (RNA) blot analysis the increase of a 2.7-kilobase ALP mRNA was observed within 3 h of RA treatment. The RA-induced enhanced ALP mRNA level did not appear to be mainly due to the stabilization of preexisting mRNA, but rather to an increase in transcription of the ALP gene."
https://openalex.org/W1925991305,"Insulin promotes insulin receptor beta-subunit phosphorylation on tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues in a variety of cells, including simian COS cells which transiently express human insulin receptors following transfection with a cDNA encoding the wild-type receptor protein. To examine the potential roles of serines 1305 and 1306 and threonine 1348 as sites of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation in these cells, these residues (i.e. either serines 1305 and 1306, or threonine 1348) were replaced with neutral (alanine) or negatively charged (aspartate) amino acids. Following transient expression of each of these mutant receptors in COS cells, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping reveals that threonine 1348 is the major, if not the only, insulin-stimulated threonine phosphorylation site. In contrast, while serines 1305 and/or 1306 are phosphorylated in an insulin-dependent manner, these sites comprise only a minor proportion of insulin receptor serine phosphorylation in these cells. Substitution of either serines 1305 and 1306 or threonine 1348 with neutral or negatively charged amino acids has no effect on insulin-stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation of these mutant receptors in intact cells. Furthermore, insulin-stimulated exogenous protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the mutant receptors is unaffected, as assessed following either phosphorylation of receptors in intact cells or following immunopurification of receptors and their autophosphorylation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1901505529,"The crystal structure of the long alpha-neurotoxin alpha-cobratoxin was refined to an R-factor of 19.5% using 3271 x-ray data to 2.4-A resolution. The polypeptide chain forms three loops, I, II, III, knotted together by four disulfide bridges, with the most prominent, loop II, containing another disulfide close to its lower tip. Loop I is stabilized by one beta-turn and two beta-sheet hydrogen bonds; loop II by eight beta-sheet hydrogen bonds, with the tip folded into two distorted right-handed helical turns stabilized by two alpha-helical and two beta-turn hydrogen bonds; and loop III by hydrophobic interactions and one beta-turn. Loop II and one strand of loop III form an antiparallel triple-pleated beta-sheet, and tight anchoring of the Asn63 side chain fixes the tail segment. In the crystal lattice, the alpha-cobratoxin molecules dimerize by beta-sheet formation between strands 53 and 57 of symmetry-related molecules. Because such interactions are found also in a cardiotoxin and alpha-bungarotoxin, this could be of importance for interaction with acetylcholine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1605633986,"Intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured in fura-2-loaded single rat mesangial cells by dual wavelength spectrofluorometry. Stimulation with arginine vasopressin (AVP) caused an initial sharp rise of [Ca2+]i followed by repetitive spikes. The frequency of the oscillations was dependent on the concentration of AVP. At 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, and 100.0 nM AVP, the frequencies of oscillations were 0.17 +/- 0.05 (n = 6), 0.32 +/- 0.05 (n = 6), 0.49 +/- 0.05 (n = 6), and 0.48 +/- 0.05 min-1 (n = 5), respectively. Reduction in extracellular [Ca2+] reduced the frequency of AVP-induced oscillations but did not abolish the oscillations. The frequency of calcium oscillations, upon stimulation with 1.0 nM AVP, was directly correlated with the basal [Ca2+]i prior to stimulation. Oscillation frequency increased with increasing temperature. An Arrhenius plot between 24 and 37 degrees C indicated a strong temperature dependency of the oscillations with a Q10 of 3.0. Protein kinase C stimulation by active phorbol esters inhibited AVP-induced calcium oscillations but not the initial [Ca2+] response to AVP. These observations are consistent with a model incorporating a feedback loop linking [Ca2+]i to the mechanism of [Ca2+]i increase. Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release may be involved, whereby inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (inositol 1,4,5-P3) formation releases Ca2+ from an inositol 1,4,5-P3-sensitive pool, with subsequent Ca2+ uptake and release from an inositol 1,4,5-P3-insensitive pool."
https://openalex.org/W1584176700,"The influence of terminal differentiation on UV-induced DNA damage and its repair in transcriptionally active and inactive genomic sequences was investigated using the murine 3T3-T proadipocyte cell culture system. Actively cycling 3T3-T cells terminally differentiate into adipocytes after exposure to media containing platelet-depleted human plasma. Suitable DNA fragments were analyzed from four genes: beta-actin, adenosine deaminase, dihydrofolate reductase, and lipoprotein lipase. As a result of 3T3-T cell differentiation, lipoprotein lipase and beta-actin expression was modified, whereas adenosine deaminase and dihydrofolate reductase expression was not affected. A DNA fragment representing the transcriptionally inactive locus 70-38 was also evaluated. UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, detected as UV-specific endonuclease-sensitive sites, in each fragment increased linearly as a function of UV dose (0-20 J/m2) independently of gene expression or differentiation. Sequence-specific repair of dimers was measured in stem and terminally differentiated 3T3-T cells after UV irradiation (10 J/m2). For undifferentiated stem cells, the rate and extent of dimer repair was higher in the actively transcribed adenosine deaminase and dihydrofolate reductase genes than in the inactive lipoprotein lipase or 70-38 fragments, the greater difference being observed in the first 8 h post-UV irradiation. In contrast, similar dimer repair rates were found for each DNA fragment in terminally differentiated 3T3-T cells. These data suggest that cellular differentiation is accompanied by a loss of heterogeneity in intragenomic DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1552676816,"The crystal structure of the C24A mutant of Azotobacter vinelandii 7Fe ferredoxin (FdI) has been solved and refined at 2.0-A resolution. The structure is isomorphous to native FdI except at the site of mutation where A24 moves toward the [4Fe-4S] cluster. In spite of this inefficient packing results: three of five van der Waals contacts from the S gamma of C24 in native FdI are lost and the remaining two become longer. Consequently, the [4Fe-4S] cluster is either disordered or has a higher temperature factor (B factor) compared to the rest of the C24A FdI molecule. In addition, the entire C24A FdI structure has a higher overall B factor than native FdI. Therefore, in comparison to native FdI, the C24A mutant is isomorphous but exhibits large differences in B factor, especially at the [4Fe-4S] cluster. In contrast, the C20A FdI structure (Martin, A. G., Burgess, B. K., Stout, C. D., Cash, V. L., Dean, D. R., Jensen, G. M., and Stephens, P. J. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 598-602), which contains large structural rearrangements in the vicinity of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, exhibits essentially no change in B factor. The conformational change observed at residue 24 is similar in both C24A and C20A FdI structures. The solvent accessibility of the Fe atoms in the [3Fe-4S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters is similar in C24A, C20A, and native FdI."
https://openalex.org/W1559952068,"A yellow-colored protein (YCP) was isolated from the hemolymph (i.e. blood) of fifth instar wandering stage larvae of Manduca sexta. The molecular mass of YCP was 31 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel filtration chromatography suggested that native YCP was a monomer. The absorbance spectrum of YCP revealed maxima at 278 and 405 nm. Chromophore was released from YCP through denaturation of the protein with methanol and chloroform. In neutral solution and in acid, the released chromophore showed the absorbance characteristics of an ommochrome: ommatin D. In addition, the chromophore was sensitive to treatment with arylsulfatase as would be expected for ommatin D. The amino acid composition and the N-terminal sequence of YCP were determined. The YCP polypeptide chain was found to be glycosylated. Carbohydrate analysis suggested that Man and GlcNAc were present in a 3:1 ratio. Circular dichroism indicated that YCP consisted of 68% beta-pleated sheet with no alpha-helices being detected. An in vitro incubation of larval fat body in the presence of [35S]methionine indicated that this organ was the site of synthesis. Ommochromes arise in insects as end products of the metabolism of tryptophan. It is well-documented that ommochromes occur in both the tissues and the excreta of insects. We propose that in M. sexta, one such tryptophan metabolite is found in the hemolymph associated with a specific protein."
https://openalex.org/W1585201466,"The function of the tandem rrnD promoters (P1, P2) of Escherichia coli, which are highly efficient in directing rRNA synthesis, was studied in vitro using the strong hybrid promoter PtacI as a reference. One of the characteristics of the rrnD promoters is a pronounced instability of binary and initiating complexes formed with RNA polymerase. The rate of productive complex formation and of chain initiation at these promoters was found to be limited by a step in binary complex transitions with an apparent first-order rate constant equal to 3.9 x 10(-2) s-1. A comparison of this rate with that determined previously by filter binding assays (Gourse, R. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16, 9789-9809) suggests that the rate-limiting step is a conversion of an species of open complex to one that is efficient in productive initiation. The slow rate of this reaction and the instability of open complexes account for the relatively low competitive strengths of the rrnD promoters. However, this limitation of rrn promoter function changes with promoter occupancy because the rate of chain initiation increased after completion of the first round of initiation. Despite their poor competitive strength, the rrnD promoters are more productive than PtacI at nonlimiting RNA polymerase concentrations. This can be ascribed to the different rates with which RNA polymerases leave PtacI and the rrnD promoters. These functional differences of the promoters are consistent with a stressed intermediate model of chain initiation (Straney, D.C., and Crothers, D.M. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 193, 267-278) which predicts that rapid clearance of the rrn promoters is mechanistically related to the instability of the binary complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1564371032,"The kinetic mechanism of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase was investigated by stopped-flow spectrofluorometry at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C. Pre-steady-state kinetic steps were identified with chemical steps proposed for the mechanism of this enzyme (Palmer, J.L., and Abeles, R.H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1217-1226). The steady-state kinetic constants for the hydrolysis or synthesis of S-adenosylhomocysteine were in good agreement with those values calculated from the pre-steady-state rate constants. The equilibrium constant for dehydration of 3'-ketoadenosine to 3'-keto-4',5'-dehydroadenosine on the enzyme was 3. The analogous equilibrium constant for addition of L-homocysteine to S-3'-keto-4',5'-dehydroadenosylhomocysteine on the enzyme was 0.3. The elimination of H2O from adenosine in solution had an equilibrium constant of 1.4 (aH2O = 1). Thus, the equilibrium constants for these elimination reactions on the enzyme were probably not perturbed significantly from those in solution. The equilibrium constant for the reduction of enzyme-bound NAD+ by adenosine was 8, and the analogous constant for the reduction of the enzyme by S-adenosylhomocysteine was 4. The equilibrium constant for the reduction of NAD+ by a secondary alcohol in solution was 5 x 10(-5) at pH 7.0. Consequently, the reduction of enzyme-bound NAD+ by adenosine was 10(5)-fold more favorable than the reduction of free NAD+. The magnitude of the first-order rate constants for the interconversion of enzyme-bound intermediates varied over a relatively small range (3-80 s-1). Similarly, the magnitude of the equilibrium constants among enzyme-bound intermediates varied over a narrow range (0.3-10). These results were consistent with the overall reversibility of the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1503396283,"Sucrase-isomaltase (SI) expression along the longitudinal and vertical axis of the small intestine was studied by sequentially isolating enterocytes from villus to crypt of rat proximal jejunum and distal ileum. Gradients of sucrase activity were observed with greatest activity occurring in jejunal and villus regions. Along the villus-to-crypt axis, gradients of SI mRNA abundance corresponded with activity. However, along the longitudinal axis no differences in SI mRNA levels were observed, thus not accounting for the observed 3-5-fold difference in SI activities between jejunum and ileum. Comparison of SI immunoprecipitates from jejunal and ileal mucosal scrapings showed significant differences in gel mobilities of the more mature forms, which did not appear to affect SI functional activities. When relative rates of de novo SI protein synthesis were compared, [35S]methionine incorporation into all SI forms was observed to be 3-5-fold greater in jejunum than in ileum at all time points. Because these results suggested differences in regional translational regulation, subcellular distribution of SI mRNA in jejunal and ileal epithelial cells was compared. A greater proportion of jejunal SI mRNA was found to be associated with membrane-bound polyribosomes. We conclude 1) sucrase expression along the villus-to-crypt axis correlates with SI mRNA abundance, 2) post-translational processing of SI differ in ileum and jejunum, but appear not to determine SI expression, and 3) differences in translational processing in distal ileum and proximal jejunum may determine sucrase activity along the longitudinal axis of rat small intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1489121595,"Cytosolic malic enzyme catalyzes the NADP(+)-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate and CO2. Additionally, this enzyme produces large amounts of reducing equivalents (NADPH) required for de novo fatty acid synthesis and provides a precursor for oxaloacetate replacement in the mitochondria. Malic enzyme is considered a key lipogenic enzyme and changes in enzyme activity parallel changes in the lipogenic rate. As would be expected, the activity of malic enzyme responds to a variety of dietary and hormonal factors acting mainly on the rate of enzyme synthesis. In the mouse, the structural locus for malic enzyme (Mod-1) is located on chromosome 9. Two alleles reflecting differences in electrophoretic mobility have been identified. This report demonstrates that the amount of hepatic malic enzyme activity is strain-dependent and is regulated by a malic enzyme regulator locus (Mod1r) located on the proximal end of chromosome 12. Two alleles have been identified: Mod1ra, conferring high enzyme activity (C57BL/6J), and Mod1rb, conferring low enzyme activity (C57BL/KsJ). Biochemical studies have demonstrated differences in the apparent Km and Vmax and in specific activity on purification and immunoprecipitation, features that suggest changes in enzyme structure even though no differences were observed by electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. These combined data suggest that differences in both enzyme quantity and structure may be involved in the genetic regulation of malic enzyme activity in mice."
