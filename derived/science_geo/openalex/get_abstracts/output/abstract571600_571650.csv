https://openalex.org/W2533012945,"Identifying the spatial organization of tissues at cellular resolution from single-cell gene expression profiles is essential to understanding biological systems. Using an in situ 3D multiplexed imaging method, seqFISH, we identify unique transcriptional states by quantifying and clustering up to 249 genes in 16,958 cells to examine whether the hippocampus is organized into transcriptionally distinct subregions. We identified distinct layers in the dentate gyrus corresponding to the granule cell layer and the subgranular zone and, contrary to previous reports, discovered that distinct subregions within the CA1 and CA3 are composed of unique combinations of cells in different transcriptional states. In addition, we found that the dorsal CA1 is relatively homogeneous at the single cell level, while ventral CA1 is highly heterogeneous. These structures and patterns are observed using different mice and different sets of genes. Together, these results demonstrate the power of seqFISH in transcriptional profiling of complex tissues."

Current theories of cortical computation fail to account for these data; they either ignore variability altogether or only model its unstructured Poisson-like aspects. We develop a theory in which the cortex performs probabilistic inference such that population activity patterns represent statistical samples from the inferred probability distribution. Our main prediction is that perceptual uncertainty is directly encoded by the variability, rather than the average, of cortical responses. Through direct comparisons to previously published data as well as original data analyses, we show that a sampling-based probabilistic representation accounts for the structure of noise, signal, and spontaneous response variability and correlations in the primary visual cortex.

These results suggest a novel role for neural variability in cortical dynamics and computations. Neural responses in sensory cortices are notoriously variable: the same stimulus can evoke a different response on each presentation (Henry et al., 1973Henry G.H. Bishop P.O. Tupper R.M. Dreher B.

Beck J.M. Latham P.E. Pouget A. Bayesian inference with probabilistic population codes.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Here, we argue that the rich structure of neural variability in sensory cortices reveals a key aspect of cortical computations: the representation of perceptual uncertainty. The need to represent uncertainty is the logical consequence of formalizing perception as unconscious inference (Helmholtz, 1962Helmholtz H.L.F. Treatise on Physiological Optics. Dovwe, 1962Google Scholar). For example, our retinal activations can have several different interpretations in terms of the composition and arrangement of objects in the environment, each being valid with a different probability. Thus, the uncertainty inherent in perceptual inference can be formalized as a probability distribution over possible perceptual interpretations of our input (Knill and Richards, 1996Knill D.C. Richards W. Perception as Bayesian Inference. Cambridge University Press, 1996Crossref Google Scholar). The question is, then, how do neural activities represent probability distributions (Fiser et al., 2010Fiser J. Berkes P. Orbán G. Lengyel M. Statistically optimal perception and learning: from behavior to neural representations.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2010; 14: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar)? We propose that probability distributions are directly represented by the variability of cortical responses. To study the implications of representing uncertainty through neural variability, we developed a model of population responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) with three main assumptions. First, we posit that neural activity patterns represent statistical samples from a probability distribution over visual features of a scene (Fiser et al., 2010Fiser J. Berkes P. Orbán G. Lengyel M. Statistically optimal perception and learning: from behavior to neural representations.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2010; 14: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, Hoyer and Hyvarinen, 2003Hoyer P. Hyvarinen A. Interpreting neural response variability as Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior.in: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. Volume 16. MIT Press, 2003: 293-300Google Scholar, Lee and Mumford, 2003Lee T.S. Mumford D. Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex.J. Opt. Soc. Am. A Opt. Image Sci. Vis. 2003; 20: 1434-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Second, we specifically propose that individual samples in the model are represented by the membrane potentials (or, equivalently, the instantaneous firing rates) of neurons. Third, as the autocorrelations of membrane potentials for any static stimulus typically decay on a relatively short (∼20 ms) timescale (Azouz and Gray, 1999Azouz R. Gray C.M. Cellular mechanisms contributing to response variability of cortical neurons in vivo.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2209-2223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), membrane-potential values (and consequently firing rates) separated on this timescale are considered statistically independent and therefore are modeled as independent stochastic samples from the underlying probability distribution. This naturally gives rise to within- as well as across-trial variability in the model. This proposed representational scheme has two main implications. First, the set of responses (i.e., membrane-potential values) at any time in a population of neurons in V1 represents a combination of visual features as a possible interpretation of the input. Second, the within-trial variability of responses is such that the relative frequency with which any population pattern is visited is equal to the probability that the corresponding combination of features is a valid interpretation of the visual scene. Thus, neural response variability is directly linked to uncertainty about the stimulus: the wider the inferred range of possible feature combinations is, the wider the distribution of responses will become. In contrast to earlier proposals for how uncertainty may be represented in cortical activities (Deneve, 2008Deneve S. Bayesian spiking neurons I: inference.Neural Comput. 2008; 20: 91-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, Ma et al., 2006Ma W.J. Beck J.M. Latham P.E. Pouget A. Bayesian inference with probabilistic population codes.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, Rao, 2004Rao R.P.N. Bayesian computation in recurrent neural circuits.Neural Comput. 2004; 16: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, Zemel et al., 1998Zemel R.S.S. Dayan P. Pouget A. Probabilistic interpretation of population codes.Neural Comput. 1998; 10: 403-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), this establishes the mean and variability of responses as independent information channels, respectively encoding the mean and the associated uncertainty of the probability distribution over visual features. Importantly, these predictions about within-trial variability can also be tested in variability measured across trials that use the same stimulus and thus elicit the same probability distribution from which responses are sampled. To test our model, we systematically compared the neural variability that our model predicted in response to various visual stimuli with the across-trial variability recorded in V1 in response to the same set of stimuli. As the parameters of our model were fundamentally determined by the statistical properties of visual scenes, rather than the properties of V1 circuits, this approach allowed a strong test of the model. Specifically, we show that the sampling-based representation of our model accounts for several key properties of response variability in V1. First, response variability not directly related to the stimulus can be so high that it dominates evoked responses (Arieli et al., 1996Arieli A. Sterkin A. Grinvald A. Aertsen A. Dynamics of ongoing activity: explanation of the large variability in evoked cortical responses.Science. 1996; 273: 1868-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar, Fiser et al., 2004Fiser J.

Orban G.A. The response variability of striate cortical neurons in the behaving monkey.Exp. Brain Res. 1989; 77: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Second, just as mean responses show systematic changes with particular attributes of the stimulus (as characterized by tuning curves), so does the variability of responses. In particular, experimental manipulations of image contrast or aperture (known to control perceptual uncertainty; Weiss et al., 2002Weiss Y. Simoncelli E.P. Adelson E.H. Motion illusions as optimal percepts.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 598-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) modulate the magnitude of variability largely independently from changes in mean responses (Churchland et al., 2010Churchland M.M. Yu B.M. Cunningham J.P. Sugrue L.P. Cohen M.R. Corrado G.S. Newsome W.T. Clark A.M. Hosseini P. Scott B.B. et al.Stimulus onset quenches neural variability: a widespread cortical phenomenon.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar); conversely, changes in the orientation of the stimulus (which do not influence uncertainty) mainly affect the trial average of responses, and affect their relative variability much less. Third, response variability exhibits systematic patterns not only in its overall magnitude but also in its fine structure: signal correlations bear a specific relationship to noise (Ecker et al., 2010Ecker A.S. Berens P. Keliris G.A. Bethge M. Logothetis N.K. Tolias A.S. Decorrelated neuronal firing in cortical microcircuits.Science. 2010; 327: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and spontaneous correlations. Fourth, more generally, the structure of response variability during evoked activity closely resembles variability during spontaneous activity (Arieli et al., 1996Arieli A. Sterkin A. Grinvald A. Aertsen A. Dynamics of ongoing activity: explanation of the large variability in evoked cortical responses.Science. 1996; 273: 1868-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar, Berkes et al., 2011aBerkes P.

Small modulation of ongoing cortical dynamics by sensory input during natural vision.Nature. 2004; 431: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In order to test and evaluate these implications of the model quantitatively, we compared model results directly to previously published experimental results whenever possible. To confirm the specific new predictions of the model about the structure and stimulus-dependent modulation of spike-count variability, we further performed novel analyses of a published dataset of V1 recordings from awake macaques (Ecker et al., 2010Ecker A.S. Berens P. Keliris G.A. Bethge M. Logothetis N.K. Tolias A.S. Decorrelated neuronal firing in cortical microcircuits.Science. 2010; 327: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These results suggest a new perspective on the functional role of variability in cortical dynamics and distinguish between previous conflicting proposals about how uncertainty is represented in the cortex. We extended a well-known family of representational models of V1, in which the visual cortex maintains an internal model of how images are generated by underlying visual features (Figure 1A; see also Figure S1, Experimental Procedures, and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). According to this internal model, an image patch is generated by a multiplicative interaction between two terms (plus noise):image=z×(∑iactivationi×basisi)+noise.(Equation 1) The first term, z, which we assumed for simplicity to be a single scalar, determines the global contrast level of the image patch. The second term is a linear combination of basis functions, and simple cell activations represent the coefficients with which each of these basis functions contribute to the image (Olshausen and Field, 1996Olshausen B.A. Field D.J. Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code for natural images.Nature. 1996; 381: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (4025) Google Scholar, Schwartz and Simoncelli, 2001Schwartz O. Simoncelli E.P. Natural signal statistics and sensory gain control.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In addition, the internal model also defines the prior probability distribution of basis function activations, P(activations), which expresses the frequency with which any combination of activations is expected to occur across different images. The role of V1 is then to invert this generative process and infer the level of activation for each feature in an image (Karklin and Lewicki, 2009Karklin Y. Lewicki M.S. Emergence of complex cell properties by learning to generalize in natural scenes.Nature. 2009; 457: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, Olshausen and Field, 1996Olshausen B.A. Field D.J.

Neurosci. 2001; 4: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar; Figure 1B, bottom; Experimental Procedures). The result of inference is a posterior distribution, P(activations|image), expressing the probability that any particular combination of features may underlie the current input. Despite behavioral evidence for the representation of uncertainty (Ernst and Banks, 2002Ernst M.O. Banks M.S. Humans integrate visual and haptic information in a statistically optimal fashion.Nature. 2002; 415: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar, Weiss et al., 2002Weiss Y. Simoncelli E.P. Adelson E.H. Motion illusions as optimal percepts.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 598-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), most previous representational models assumed that neural activities represent a single combination of features for each input (Karklin and Lewicki, 2009Karklin Y. Lewicki M.S. Emergence of complex cell properties by learning to generalize in natural scenes.Nature. 2009; 457: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, Olshausen and Field, 1996Olshausen B.A. Field D.J.

Neurosci. 2001; 4: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), such as the one with the maximum posterior probability. These models were thus unable to capture the uncertainty expressed by the extent of the posterior. In contrast, our model maintained a representation of uncertainty by neural activities encoding randomly sampled feature combinations under the posterior. That is, the relative occurrence frequency of any neural activity pattern was equal to the inferred probability that the feature combination represented by it may have generated the input image. More specifically, we assumed that samples from the posterior were represented by the fluctuating membrane potentials of V1 cells through a weak compressing non-linearity, and we derived the instantaneous firing rate of a cell as a rectified-nonlinear function of its membrane potential (Carandini, 2004Carandini M. Amplification of trial-to-trial response variability by neurons in visual cortex.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E264Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar; Figure 1B, top; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Thus, we took the membrane-potential values in a population of cells at any moment in time to represent a single sample from the multidimensional posterior, so that subsequent membrane potential values represented a sequence of samples (Figure 1C). This allowed us to make predictions about the form of the resulting distribution of neural activities in V1 without assuming a specific form for the underlying neural circuit dynamics. Interpreting neural population activity patterns as samples from the posterior distribution of the internal model determined by Equation 1 establishes a direct link between the parameters of the posterior and the statistics of population responses. For example, the mean and the covariance of the posterior given a particular input image respectively correspond to the average and covariance of the neural responses evoked by that image. Thus, understanding the basic properties of the posterior distribution, and their dependence on the stimulus, provides key insights about the stimulus-dependent changes of cortical variability predicted by our model, which can be most directly demonstrated in the membrane-potential responses of a pair of model neurons (Figure 2). The variability of the average response of each cell across different stimuli is predicted by the dependence of the posterior mean on the image. As the basis functions in our model are oriented Gabor filters that are assumed to combine linearly in the image (Equation 1), the posterior mean of the activation of each basis function is largely determined by its linear overlap with the stimulus (Experimental Procedures; Equation 5). Thus, as in earlier models (Olshausen and Field, 1996Olshausen B.A. Field D.J. Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code for natural images.Nature. 1996; 381: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (4025) Google Scholar), the trial-average response for simple oriented stimuli (such as commonly used full-field gratings) depends monotonically on the similarity of the “preferred orientation” of a cell (the orientation of its basis function) and the orientation of the stimulus, resulting in orientation-dependent tuning curves (Figure S2). Changes in image contrast lead to corresponding changes in the inferred level of contrast, z (Figure 2A). A low-contrast image provides less evidence about the exact content of the image, so inferences rely predominantly on prior expectations, P(activations). In the extreme case of a blank stimulus, z approaches zero (Figure 2A, light gray), so inferences about the basis function activations that neurons represent are unconstrained by the image (Equation 1 is constant with respect to the activations), and thus the posterior becomes entirely determined by the prior (Berkes et al., 2011aBerkes P. Orbán G. Lengyel M. Fiser J. Spontaneous cortical activity reveals hallmarks of an optimal internal model of the environment.Science. 2011; 331: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, Fiser et al., 2010Fiser J. Berkes P. Orbán G. Lengyel M. Statistically optimal perception and learning: from behavior to neural representations.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2010; 14: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In other words, spontaneous activity, as a special case of evoked activity recorded in response to a blank stimulus, represents samples from the prior (Figure 2B). For higher contrast levels, the inferred level of z also grows (Figure 2A, dark gray and black), so that the input image increasingly constrains the posterior of basis-function activations, which thus increasingly deviates from the prior (Figures 2C and 2D). This deviation has two major aspects. First, the mean of the posterior becomes different from the prior mean, and will be specific to the particular image that gave rise to it. This implies that signal variability, the variability of the mean response across different stimuli, grows with contrast (Figures 2B–2D, insets on top). Second, the observation of a high-contrast image reduces uncertainty (on average) about basis function activations relative to the prior. Thus, the (co)variance of individual posteriors will be smaller than that of the prior, implying that noise (co)variances, the across-trial variability of neural responses to the same stimulus, must decrease with increasing contrast (e.g., red covariance ellipses across Figures 2B–2D; see also Figures 3, 4A , 4B, and 5C). As opposed to the mean of the posterior (cf. Figure S2), its covariance does not show a strong dependence on the detailed content of the stimulus beyond its overall contrast (red versus green versus blue covariance ellipses within Figures 2B–2D; see also Figures 4C–4E). This is intuitive; for example, changing the orientation of a grating, as opposed to its contrast, does not influence our uncertainty about it.Figure 4Stimulus Dependence of Neural Response VariabilityShow full caption(A) Across-trial SD of peak response amplitudes of a population of cells (circles) for low-contrast gratings plotted against the SD for high-contrast gratings at the preferred (blue) and non-preferred (red) stimulus orientation.(B) Spike-count Fano factors (mean matched) for low- and high-contrast stimuli.(C) Dependence of membrane potential SD on grating orientation at high (solid black line) and low (solid gray line) contrast.

https://openalex.org/W2536391716,"Long-term changes of neurotransmitter release are critical for proper brain function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood. While protein synthesis is crucial for the consolidation of postsynaptic plasticity, whether and how protein synthesis regulates presynaptic plasticity in the mature mammalian brain remain unclear. Here, using paired whole-cell recordings in rodent hippocampal slices, we report that presynaptic protein synthesis is required for long-term, but not short-term, plasticity of GABA release from type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1)-expressing axons. This long-term depression of inhibitory transmission (iLTD) involves cap-dependent protein synthesis in presynaptic interneuron axons, but not somata. Translation is required during the induction, but not maintenance, of iLTD. Mechanistically, CB1 activation enhances protein synthesis via the mTOR pathway. Furthermore, using super-resolution STORM microscopy, we revealed eukaryotic ribosomes in CB1-expressing axon terminals. These findings suggest that presynaptic local protein synthesis controls neurotransmitter release during long-term plasticity in the mature mammalian brain."

To identify the landscape of proteomic changes that contribute to opposing forms of homeostatic plasticity, we examined the plasticity-induced changes in the newly synthesized proteome. Cultured rat hippocampal neurons underwent homeostatic up-scaling or down-scaling. We used BONCAT (bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging) to metabolically label, capture, and identify newly synthesized proteins, detecting and analyzing 5,940 newly synthesized proteins using mass spectrometry and label-free quantitation. Neither up- nor down-scaling produced changes in the number of different proteins translated. Rather, up- and down-scaling elicited opposing translational regulation of several molecular pathways, producing targeted adjustments in the proteome. We discovered ∼300 differentially regulated proteins involved in neurite outgrowth, axon guidance, filopodia assembly, excitatory synapses, and glutamate receptor complexes. We also identified differentially regulated proteins that are associated with multiple diseases, including schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease.

Neuronal networks are subject to fluctuations in both the magnitude and frequency of inputs, requiring plasticity mechanisms to stabilize network activity. Homeostatic synaptic scaling adjusts the strength of neuronal connections up or down in response to changes in input (Davis, 2013Davis G.W.

At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, genetic manipulations that alter postsynaptic receptor function result in compensatory changes in presynaptic neurotransmitter release (see Davis, 2013Davis G.W.

At mammalian synapses, blocking action potential-mediated activity either pharmacologically (O’Brien et al., 1998O’Brien R.J. Kamboj S. Ehlers M.D. Rosen K.R. Fischbach G.D. Huganir R.L.

Multiple forms of synaptic plasticity triggered by selective suppression of activity in individual neurons.Nature. 2002; 420: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) can lead to a global up-scaling of synaptic responses. Conversely, a global stimulation of activity, effected by blocking GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition, leads to a significant down-scaling of synaptic responses (O’Brien et al., 1998O’Brien R.J. Kamboj S. Ehlers M.D. Rosen K.R. Fischbach G.D. Huganir R.L.

What is the nature of the molecular changes that bring about the synaptic scaling at mammalian synapses? Several groups have postulated that fluctuations in intracellular Ca2+ levels initially “sense” changes in activity (Ibata et al., 2008Ibata K. Sun Q. Turrigiano G.G.

Sun Q. Turrigiano G.G. Rapid synaptic scaling induced by changes in postsynaptic firing.Neuron. 2008; 57: 819-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of scaling up is mediated by the accumulation of GluR2-containing receptors (Gainey et al., 2009Gainey M.A. Hurvitz-Wolff J.R. Lambo M.E. Turrigiano G.G.

Other molecules implicated in various aspects of synaptic scaling include the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Rutherford et al., 1998Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Turrigiano G.G.

All of the above molecules were discovered using a candidate-based approach, making good “guesses” about the players that might be important, leaving open the possibility that many important molecules have not yet been discovered. The long time course (∼24 hr) required for most forms of synaptic homeostasis to be established (O’Brien et al., 1998O’Brien R.J. Kamboj S. Ehlers M.D. Rosen K.R. Fischbach G.D. Huganir R.L.

Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar) suggests a requirement for changes in gene expression, either by regulated transcription or translation, or both. Indeed, upscaling elicited by a 24 hr TTX treatment is blocked by a transcription inhibitor (Ibata et al., 2008Ibata K. Sun Q. Turrigiano G.G. Rapid synaptic scaling induced by changes in postsynaptic firing.Neuron. 2008; 57: 819-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In a form of homeostatic depression elicited by ChR2-stimulation of individual neurons, a requirement for both transcription and translation has been reported (Goold and Nicoll, 2010Goold C.P. Nicoll R.A. Single-cell optogenetic excitation drives homeostatic synaptic depression.Neuron. 2010; 68: 512-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Whether the classic homeostatic plasticity, elicited pharmacologically, requires changes in new protein translation has, surprisingly, not been addressed. What is known about the transcriptomic and proteomic alterations that underlie homeostatic plasticity? A recent study studied a few selected transcripts with qPCR and showed that homeostatic upscaling resulted in a significant increase in the Gria1, Tet1, and Gadd 45b transcripts (Meadows et al., 2015Meadows J.P. Guzman-Karlsson M.C. Phillips S. Holleman C. Posey J.L. Day J.J. Hablitz J.J. Sweatt J.D. DNA methylation regulates neuronal glutamatergic synaptic scaling.Sci. Signal. 2015; 8: ra61Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). While alterations in transcripts can lead to changes in protein abundance, several studies have shown that in complex systems the correlation between the transcriptome and the proteome can be low (Gygi et al., 1999Gygi S.P. Rochon Y. Franza B.R. Aebersold R. Correlation between protein and mRNA abundance in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1720-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3185) Google Scholar, Komatsu and Hossain, 2013Komatsu S. Hossain Z.

Dynamic profiling of the protein life cycle in response to pathogens.Science. 2015; 347: 1259038Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). As proteins are the primary and most common effectors in all cellular processes, it is important to determine the proteome directly to understand how plasticity fundamentally alters the neuronal and synaptic landscape. Recent advances in proteomic technology have led to unprecedented coverage and depth in the identification of proteins in cells and tissues. A recent study, for example, identified over 8,000 proteins in each of several different brain areas, including the hippocampus (Sharma et al., 2015Sharma K. Schmitt S. Bergner C.G. Tyanova S. Kannaiyan N. Manrique-Hoyos N. Kongi K. Cantuti L. Hanisch U.K. Philips M.A. et al.Cell type- and brain region-resolved mouse brain proteome.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In addition, over 2,000 proteins reliably associated with the postsynaptic density have also been identified (Distler et al., 2014Distler U. Schmeisser M.J. Pelosi A. Reim D. Kuharev J. Weiczner R. Baumgart J. Boeckers T.M. Nitsch R. Vogt J. Tenzer S.

The local transcriptome in the synaptic neuropil revealed by deep sequencing and high-resolution imaging.Neuron. 2012; 74: 453-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Quantitative proteomic analyses that focus on the entire (unlabeled) proteome, however, do not allow one to identify proteins synthesized in response to plasticity. For example, if one observes an increase in protein levels, it is impossible to determine whether the increase is due to enhanced protein synthesis or decreased protein degradation. In order to isolate the analysis of the newly synthesized proteome associated with plasticity, metabolic labeling is required. Bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) enables pulsed metabolic labeling of newly synthesized proteins using non-canonical amino acids like azidohomoalanine (AHA) together with click-chemistry followed by mass spectrometry (Dieterich et al., 2006Dieterich D.C. Link A.J. Graumann J. Tirrell D.A. Schuman E.M. Selective identification of newly synthesized proteins in mammalian cells using bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT).Proc. Natl.

Labeling, detection and identification of newly synthesized proteomes with bioorthogonal non-canonical amino-acid tagging.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Using this method, alterations in newly synthesized proteins can be directly determined. This approach has been applied to identify newly synthesized proteins in many systems (Landgraf et al., 2015Landgraf P. Antileo E.R. Schuman E.M. Dieterich D.C. BONCAT: metabolic labeling, click chemistry, and affinity purification of newly synthesized proteomes.Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1266: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), including in the hippocampus following treatment with dopamine (Hodas et al., 2012Hodas J.J. Nehring A. Höche N. Sweredoski M.J. Pielot R. Hess S. Tirrell D.A. Dieterich D.C. Schuman E.M. Dopaminergic modulation of the hippocampal neuropil proteome identified by bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT).Proteomics. 2012; 12: 2464-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or BDNF (Bowling et al., 2016Bowling H. Bhattacharya A. Zhang G. Lebowitz J.Z. Alam D. Smith P.T. Kirshenbaum K. Neubert T.A. Vogel C. Chao M.V. Klann E. BONLAC: A combinatorial proteomic technique to measure stimulus-induced translational profiles in brain slices.Neuropharmacology. 2016; 100: 76-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The opposite phenotypes elicited during synaptic up-scaling and down-scaling represent a unique opportunity to examine the underlying proteomic plasticity and identify pathways that are bi-directionally or coordinately regulated. Here we detect an unprecedented number of newly synthesized proteins and provide a comprehensive map of the newly synthesized proteome following both up- and down-scaling. To ascertain, first, whether pharmacologically elicited synaptic scaling requires protein synthesis, we conducted experiments in which protein synthesis was inhibited during the scaling manipulation (Figure S1). In order to elicit up-scaling, cultured hippocampal neurons were treated with the Na+ channel antagonist tetrodotoxin (1 μM) for 24 hr to elicit an increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude (Figure S1A). The co-application of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (40 μM) prevented the mEPSC amplitude increase (Figure S1B). In order to elicit down-scaling, cultured hippocampal neurons (DIV 21) were treated with the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (40 μM) for 24 hr to elicit a decrease in mEPSC amplitude (Figure S1A). The co-application of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (40 μM) prevented the mEPSC amplitude decrease, indicating a requirement for new protein synthesis (Figure S1C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that protein synthesis is required for both up- and down-scaling elicited pharmacologically in cultured neurons. In order to identify the specific proteins synthesized following global manipulations of neuronal activity, we used BONCAT (Figures 1 and 2; Dieterich et al., 2006Dieterich D.C. Link A.J. Graumann J. Tirrell D.A. Schuman E.M. Selective identification of newly synthesized proteins in mammalian cells using bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 9482-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) together with the paradigm of homeostatic scaling. For the duration of the scaling induction (24 hr of either bicuculline or TTX, as above) cultured hippocampal neurons (DIV 21) were treated with the non-canonical amino acid azidohomoalanine (AHA; 4 mM) to label the newly synthesized proteins associated with homeostatic scaling. A control group was exposed to AHA for 24 hr in the absence of either bicuculline or TTX. An additional negative control group was treated with methionine, the amino acid from which AHA is derived (Met; 4 mM) (Figure 2A). Following scaling induction, neuronal lysates were prepared and BONCAT (see Experimental Procedures) was performed to capture, purify, and identify the newly synthesized proteins (Figure 2A). For each set of experiments, we conducted five independent biological replicates that were each injected in four technical replicate LC-MS/MS runs (see Experimental Procedures; Figure 1 and S2). To identify proteins, we required a minimum of one tryptic peptide per protein (see Experimental Procedures; Table S9). With a few exceptions (see Experimental Procedures), any protein detected in a methionine control experiment was subtracted from our experimental dataset, and only proteins present in more than two biological replicates were retained for subsequent analysis. In the above experiments, we obtained an unprecedented coverage and depth of the newly synthesized proteome. Our master dataset, comprising the union of the untreated, scaled-up, and scaled-down groups, includes 5,940 unique protein groups representing all key cellular processes, including metabolic enzymes, cell signaling, and structural proteins (Figures 1 and 2B; Table S1). We were able to detect most of the important neuronal membrane proteins including ion channels and a majority of the subunits of the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, including AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits as well as GABAA and GABAB receptors (Figures 5 and S5; Tables S1 and S3). In addition, we identified many membrane proteins associated with presynaptic membranes and vesicles, including both vesicular and plasma membrane transporters (Figure 6; Tables S1 and S3). These data are described in much greater detail below. In order to assess the depth and breadth of our newly synthesized proteome, we compared the newly synthesized proteome of control (not subjected to scaling) AHA-treated neurons to a global hippocampal proteome dataset (Sharma et al., 2015Sharma K. Schmitt S. Bergner C.G. Tyanova S. Kannaiyan N. Manrique-Hoyos N. Kongi K. Cantuti L. Hanisch U.K. Philips M.A. et al.Cell type- and brain region-resolved mouse brain proteome.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures; Figure 1). We found that there was substantial overlap between the pulse (24 hr)-labeled nascent hippocampal proteome and the global hippocampal proteome (Figure 2C). The AHA-labeled proteome also captured many proteins not identified in the global proteome, likely owing to the specific enrichment and reduced sample complexity of the AHA-proteome and the resulting expanded dynamic range. We considered the possibility that some of the AHA-exclusive proteins represent short-lived proteins that are less likely to be detected in the large global proteome sample. To examine this possibility, we compared the reported protein half-lives for the AHA-exclusive proteins to a comparable number of proteins from the global hippocampal proteome. Using data from Cohen et al., 2013Cohen L.D. Zuchman R. Sorokina O. Müller A. Dieterich D.C. Armstrong J.D. Ziv T. Ziv N.E. Metabolic turnover of synaptic proteins: kinetics, interdependencies and implications for synaptic maintenance.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e63191Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, we extracted all of the half-life data for AHA-exclusive proteins analyzed in their dataset (n = 60) and compared the distribution of half-lives to the same number of proteins sub-sampled from the global hippocampal proteome. We observed a shift toward a shorter half-life in the distribution for AHA-labeled proteins (Figure 2D), suggesting that one feature of the AHA-exclusive proteins may be a faster turnover, making the proteins more difficult to capture and detect in global proteomic studies. We next analyzed the newly synthesized proteome in control (untreated), scaled-up, and scaled-down samples. First we examined the total nascent proteome size and discovered that homeostatic scaling does not significantly alter the number of unique newly synthesized proteins in the total proteome. The total nascent proteome size in each group (control, scaled-up, and scaled-down) was between 5,100 and 5,200 proteins (Figures 1 and 2E; Table S1). In the negative control methionine-treated samples, there were ∼594 proteins detected. Notably, in each AHA-treated group, over ∼80% of the proteins were identified in 3/5 biological replicates and over ∼90% of the proteins were identified in 2/5 biological replicates (Figure 2F). As there was no significant difference in the newly synthesized proteome size between groups, these data indicate that homeostatic scaling is associated with a balanced stimulation and inhibition of synthesis of protein groups. We hypothesized that the dominant class of proteomic change during scaling would comprise changes in the abundance of proteins that perform essential cellular and synaptic functions. To analyze this, we compared protein abundances in the up-scaled or down-scaled nascent proteomes to control nascent proteomes using a label-free quantitation (LFQ)-based analysis (see Experimental Procedures; Figure 1). Altogether, we discovered over 300 proteins with significantly regulated expression levels following homeostatic plasticity (Figures 3A and S4; Table S2). This group comprises proteins that are co-regulated or singly regulated by either up- or down-scaling. Figure 3A depicts all proteins analyzed, and the four quadrants in the graph highlight four basic categories of significantly regulated newly synthesized proteins. Two quadrants depict proteins that exhibit coordinate regulation: both up- and down-scaling result in either an enhancement (upper right quadrant) or a reduction (lower left quadrant) in the synthesis of particular proteins. When compared to control samples, there were 70 proteins that exhibited enhanced protein synthesis associated with both up-scaling and down-scaling (Figure 3A, upper right quadrant). Some of the protein families that were overrepresented include the following: transcriptional activation, mRNA transport and splicing, and tyrosine phosphatases and kinases (Table S3). On the other hand, when compared to control samples, there were 97 proteins that exhibited reduced protein synthesis during both up-scaling and down-scaling (Figure 3A, lower left quadrant). Functional annotation analysis reveals a significant enrichment of protein families mediating inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive calcium release, sphingomyelin degradation, and cell-cell adhesion essential for dendritic spine morphogenesis as well as other cellular functions (Table S3). Taken together, these two groups of proteins exhibit consistent enhanced or reduced synthesis, regardless of the sign of the plasticity, and thus might be considered as “general” scaling proteins that respond to global changes in neuronal activity. The remaining categories are represented by proteins significantly altered in a bi-directional manner: for these proteins, enhanced synthesis is associated with one form of plasticity (either up- or down-scaling) while reduced synthesis is associated with the other form (Figures 3A and 4; Table S2). When compared to control samples, there were 105 proteins that exhibited enhanced protein synthesis associated with up-scaling and reduced protein synthesis during down-scaling (Figure 3A, lower right quadrant). GO analysis of this group indicates a significant enrichment for proteins largely involved in synaptic function, including, for example, the family of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CamK) and proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport and exocytosis (Figure 4; Table S3). Indeed, the most differentially regulated group was the ionotropic glutamate receptor complex, the target of many mechanistic studies of homeostasis (Table S5) (Turrigiano, 2012Turrigiano G. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity: local and global mechanisms for stabilizing neuronal function.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a005736Crossref Scopus (643) Google Scholar). When compared to control samples, there were 35 proteins that exhibited enhanced protein synthesis during down-scaling and reduced protein synthesis during up-scaling (Figure 3A, upper left quadrant; Figure 4). Functional annotation analysis of this group indicates a significant enrichment of calcium-dependent protein serine/threonine phosphatases, splicing factors, transcription factors, calcineurin regulators, and synaptotagmins. Additional enriched proteins in this group are implicated in mRNA deadenylation, ubiquitin activation, cell growth, and other categories (Table S3). The above proteins should thus be considered as “specific” scaling proteins that respond with a specific signature to either homeostatic up- or down-scaling. We also considered the entire population (∼307) of regulated nascent proteins as a single group and examined, using a String analysis, the networks of regulated proteins and the interactions between them (Figure S3). We identified one large network of regulated proteins containing 95 network members with the number of interaction partners ranging from 1 to greater than 7. Protein hubs in this network were represented by several protein kinases including the Fyn kinase, Lyn kinase, Map kinase 3, and Protein kinase C beta. In addition, other proteins such as the FGF receptor were linked to several other significantly regulated proteins. The remaining networks comprising significantly regulated proteins were small, ranging from 2 to 6 proteins, and the remaining regulated proteins were not linked to networks. Finally, we considered the possibility that elements of the homeostatic proteomic response could be newly synthesized proteins that were uniquely and exclusively associated with either the control or scaled groups. We found no highly abundant (> 10 peptides) proteins exclusively in scaled-up or scaled-down neurons. As regulatory proteins may be low abu"
https://openalex.org/W2539080302,"Axonal microtubule (MT) arrays are the major cytoskeleton substrate for cargo transport. How MT organization, i.e., polymer length, number, and minus-end spacing, is regulated and how it impinges on axonal transport are unclear. We describe a method for analyzing neuronal MT organization using light microscopy. This method circumvents the need for electron microscopy reconstructions and is compatible with live imaging of cargo transport and MT dynamics. Examination of a C. elegans motor neuron revealed how age, MT-associated proteins, and signaling pathways control MT length, minus-end spacing, and coverage. In turn, MT organization determines axonal transport progression: cargoes pause at polymer termini, suggesting that switching MT tracks is rate limiting for efficient transport. Cargo run length is set by MT length, and higher MT coverage correlates with shorter pauses. These results uncover the principles and mechanisms of neuronal MT organization and its regulation of axonal cargo transport."

https://openalex.org/W2531956768,"An association mapping panel, named as CIMMYT Asia association mapping (CAAM) panel, involving 396 diverse tropical maize lines were phenotyped for various structural and functional traits of roots under drought and well-watered conditions. The experiment was conducted during Kharif (summer-rainy) season of 2012 and 2013 in root phenotyping facility at CIMMYT-Hyderabad, India. The CAAM panel was genotyped to generate 955, 690 SNPs through GBS v2.7 using Illumina Hi-seq 2000/2500 at Institute for Genomic Diversity, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. GWAS analysis was carried out using 331,390 SNPs filtered from the entire set of SNPs revealed a total of 50 and 67 SNPs significantly associated for root functional (transpiration efficiency, flowering period water use) and structural traits (rooting depth, root dry weight, root length, root volume, root surface area and root length density), respectively. In addition to this, 37 SNPs were identified for grain yield and shoot biomass under well-watered and drought stress. Though many SNPs were found to have significant association with the traits under study, SNPs that were common for more than one trait were discussed in detail. A total 18 SNPs were found to have common association with more than one trait, out of which 12 SNPs were found within or near the various gene functional regions. In this study we attempted to identify the trait specific maize lines based on the presence of favorable alleles for the SNPs associated with multiple traits. Two SNPs S3_128533512 and S7_151238865 were associated with transpiration efficiency, shoot biomass and grain yield under well-watered condition. Based on favorable allele for these SNPs seven inbred lines were identified. Similarly, four lines were identified for transpiration efficiency and shoot biomass under drought stress based on the presence of favorable allele for the common SNPs S1_211520521, S2_20017716, S3_57210184 and S7_130878458 and three lines were identified for flowering period water-use, transpiration efficiency, root dry weight and root volume based on the presence of favorable allele for the common SNPs S3_162065732 and S3_225760139."

Subjects and Methods A written informed consent approved by the Weill Cornell institutional review board was signed and obtained from the study participants. Thirty-seven consecutive patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis who were treated with venous sinus stenting between Jan.2012-Jan.2016 were prospectively evaluated. Patients without pulsatile tinnitus were excluded. Tinnitus severity was categorized based on “Tinnitus Handicap Inventory” (THI) at pre-stent, day-0, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, 18-month and 2-year follow-up. Demographics, body-mass index (BMI), pre and post VSS trans-stenotic pressure gradient were documented. Statistical analysis performed using Pearson’s correlation, Chi-square analysis and Fischer’s exact test. Results 29 patients with a mean age of 29.5±8.5 years M:F = 1:28. Median (mean) THI pre and post stenting were: 4 (3.7) and 1 (1) respectively. Median time of tinnitus resolution post VSS was 0-days. There was significant improvement of THI (Δ Mean: 2.7 THI [95% CI: 2.3–3.1 THI], p<0.001) and transverse-distal sigmoid sinus gradient (Δ Mean: -15.3 mm Hg [95% CI: 12.7–18 mm Hg], p<0.001) post-stenting. Mean follow-up duration of 26.4±9.8 months (3–44 months). VSS was feasible in 100% patients with no procedural complications. Three-patients (10%) had recurrent sinus stenosis and tinnitus at mean follow-up of 12 months (6–30 months). Conclusion Venous sinus stenting is an effective treatment for pulsatile tinnitus in patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis."
https://openalex.org/W2345425201,"In January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto gave rise to the “Bitcoin Blockchain”, creating the first block of the chain hashing on his computer’s central processing unit (CPU). Since then, the hash calculations to mine Bitcoin have been getting more and more complex, and consequently the mining hardware evolved to adapt to this increasing difficulty. Three generations of mining hardware have followed the CPU’s generation. They are GPU’s, FPGA’s and ASIC’s generations. This work presents an agent-based artificial market model of the Bitcoin mining process and of the Bitcoin transactions. The goal of this work is to model the economy of the mining process, starting from GPU’s generation, the first with economic significance. The model reproduces some “stylized facts” found in real-time price series and some core aspects of the mining business. In particular, the computational experiments performed can reproduce the unit root property, the fat tail phenomenon and the volatility clustering of Bitcoin price series. In addition, under proper assumptions, they can reproduce the generation of Bitcoins, the hashing capability, the power consumption, and the mining hardware and electrical energy expenditures of the Bitcoin network."
https://openalex.org/W2535045459,"Worldwide, Salmonella spp. is a significant cause of disease for both humans and wildlife, with wild birds adapted to urban environments having different opportunities for pathogen exposure, infection, and transmission compared to their natural conspecifics. Food provisioning by people may influence these factors, especially when high-density mixed species flocks aggregate. White Ibises (Eudocimus albus), an iconic Everglades species in decline in Florida, are becoming increasingly common in urbanized areas of south Florida where most are hand-fed. We examined the prevalence of Salmonella shedding by ibises to determine the role of landscape characteristics where ibis forage and their behavior, on shedding rates. We also compared Salmonella isolated from ibises to human isolates to better understand non-foodborne human salmonellosis. From 2010–2013, 13% (n = 261) adult/subadult ibises and 35% (n = 72) nestlings sampled were shedding Salmonella. The prevalence of Salmonella shedding by ibises significantly decreased as the percent of Palustrine emergent wetlands and herbaceous grasslands increased, and increased as the proportion of open-developed land types (e.g. parks, lawns, golf courses) increased, suggesting that natural ecosystem land cover types supported birds with a lower prevalence of infection. A high diversity of Salmonella serotypes (n = 24) and strain types (43 PFGE types) were shed by ibises, of which 33% of the serotypes ranked in the top 20 of high significance for people in the years of the study. Importantly, 44% of the Salmonella Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis patterns for ibis isolates (n = 43) matched profiles in the CDC PulseNet USA database. Of these, 20% came from Florida in the same three years we sampled ibis. Importantly, there was a negative relationship between the amount of Palustrine emergent wetland and the number of Salmonella isolates from ibises that matched human cases in the PulseNet database (p = 0.056). Together, our results indicate that ibises are good indicators of salmonellae strains circulating in their environment and they have both the potential and opportunity to transmit salmonellae to people. Finally, they may act as salmonellae carriers to natural environments where other more highly-susceptible groups (nestlings) may be detrimentally affected."
https://openalex.org/W2545421535,"Concerns about the high cost of orphan drugs has led to questions being asked about the generosity of the incentives for development, and associated company profits.We conducted a retrospective, propensity score matched study of publicly-listed orphan companies. Cases were defined as holders of orphan drug market authorisation in Europe or the USA between 2000-12. Control companies were selected based on their propensity for being orphan drug market authorisation holders. We applied system General Method of Moments to test whether companies with orphan drug market authorization are valued higher, as measured by the Tobin's Q and market to book value ratios, and are more profitable based on return on assets, than non-orphan drug companies.86 companies with orphan drug approvals in European (4), USA (61) or both (21) markets were matched with 258 controls. Following adjustment, orphan drug market authorization holders have a 9.6% (95% confidence interval, 0.6% to 18.7%) higher return on assets than non-orphan drug companies; Tobin's Q was higher by 9.9% (1.0% to 19.7%); market to book value by 15.7% (3.1% to 30.0%) and operating profit by 516% (CI 19.8% to 1011%). For each additional orphan drug sold, return on assets increased by 11.1% (0.6% to 21.3%), Tobin's Q by 2.7% (0.2% to 5.2%), and market to book value ratio by 5.8% (0.7% to 10.9%).Publicly listed pharmaceutical companies that are orphan drug market authorization holders are associated with higher market value and greater profits than companies not producing treatments for rare diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2536020486,"Cutaneous leishmaniasis affects nearly 0.7 to 1.3 million people annually. Treatment of this disease is difficult due to lack of appropriate medication and the growing problem of drug resistance. Natural compounds such as coumarins serve as complementary therapeutic agents in addition to the current treatment modalities. In this study, we have performed an in-silico screening of the coumarin derivatives and their anti-leishmanial properties has been explored both in-vitro and in-vivo. One of the compounds (compound 2) exhibited leishmanicidal activity and to further study its properties, nanoliposomal formulation of the compound was developed. Treatment of cutaneous lesions in BALB/c mice with compound 2 showed significantly reduced lesion size as compared to the untreated mice (p<0.05) suggesting that compound 2 may possess anti-leishmanial properties."
https://openalex.org/W2532396777,"This study examined whether instrumental and normative learning contexts differentially influence 4- to 7-year-old children’s social learning strategies; specifically, their dispositions to copy an expert versus a majority consensus. Experiment 1 (N = 44) established that children copied a relatively competent “expert” individual over an incompetent individual in both kinds of learning context. In experiment 2 (N = 80) we then tested whether children would copy a competent individual versus a majority, in each of the two different learning contexts. Results showed that individual children differed in strategy, preferring with significant consistency across two different test trials to copy either the competent individual or the majority. This study is the first to show that children prefer to copy more competent individuals when shown competing methods of achieving an instrumental goal (Experiment 1) and provides new evidence that children, at least in our “individualist” culture, may consistently express either a competency or majority bias in learning both instrumental and normative information (Experiment 2). This effect was similar in the instrumental and normative learning contexts we applied."
https://openalex.org/W2535007273,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) degrades soluble proteins and small aggregates, whereas macroautophagy (autophagy herein) eliminates larger protein aggregates, tangles and even whole organelles in a lysosome-dependent manner. VCP/p97 was implicated in both pathways. VCP/p97 mutations cause a rare multisystem disease called IBMPFD (Inclusion Body Myopathy with Paget’s Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia). Here, we studied the role IBMPFD-related mutants of VCP/p97 in autophagy. In contrast with the wild-type VCP/p97 protein or R155C or R191Q mutants, the P137L mutant was aggregate-prone. We showed that, unlike commonly studied R155C or R191Q mutants, the P137L mutant protein stimulated both autophagosome and autolysosome formation. Moreover, P137L mutant protein itself was a substrate of autophagy. Starvation- and mTOR inhibition-induced autophagy led to the degradation of the P137L mutant protein, while preserving the wild-type and functional VCP/p97. Strikingly, similar to the P137L mutant, other IBMPFD-related VCP/p97 mutants, namely R93C and G157R mutants induced autophagosome and autolysosome formation; and G157R mutant formed aggregates that could be cleared by autophagy. Therefore, cellular phenotypes caused by P137L mutant expression were not isolated observations, and some other IBMPFD disease-related VCP/p97 mutations could lead to similar outcomes. Our results indicate that cellular mechanisms leading to IBMPFD disease may be various, and underline the importance of studying different disease-associated mutations in order to better understand human pathologies and tailor mutation-specific treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2537445610,"The influence of geographic range on species persistence has long been of interest and there is a need for a better understanding of the genetic consequences for species with restricted distributions, particularly with the increasing rate of global species extinctions. However, the genetic effects of restricted range are often confounded by the impacts of population distribution. We compared chloroplast and nuclear genetic diversity and differentiation in two acacias, the restricted, patchily distributed Acacia atkinsiana and the widespread, semi-continuously distributed A. ancistrocarpa. Lower intra-population diversity and higher differentiation between populations were seen in A. atkinsiana compared to its widespread congener, A. ancistrocarpa. There was little evidence of geographical influences on population genetic structure in A. ancistrocarpa whereas A. atkinsiana exhibited nuclear genetic structure with isolation by distance, differentiation of near-coastal populations from those in the ranges, and differentiation of peripheral populations from those in the centre of the distribution. These results are consistent with expectations of the effect of geographic range and population distribution on genetic diversity, but indicate that distribution of populations rather than geographic range has influenced the observed genetic structure. The contrasting patterns observed here demonstrate that conservation approaches for species management and ecological restoration need to consider the distribution of populations in geographically restricted species."
https://openalex.org/W2534430635,"Peritonitis and ultrafiltration failure remain serious complications of chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD). Dysfunctional cellular stress responses aggravate peritoneal injury associated with PD fluid exposure, potentially due to peritoneal glutamine depletion. In this randomized cross-over phase I/II trial we investigated cytoprotective effects of alanyl-glutamine (AlaGln) addition to glucose-based PDF.In a prospective randomized cross-over design, 20 stable PD outpatients underwent paired peritoneal equilibration tests 4 weeks apart, using conventional acidic, single chamber 3.86% glucose PD fluid, with and without 8 mM supplemental AlaGln. Heat-shock protein 72 expression was assessed in peritoneal effluent cells as surrogate parameter of cellular stress responses, complemented by metabolomics and functional immunocompetence assays.AlaGln restored peritoneal glutamine levels and increased the primary outcome heat-shock protein expression (effect 1.51-fold, CI 1.07-2.14; p = 0.022), without changes in peritoneal ultrafiltration, small solute transport, or biomarkers reflecting cell mass and inflammation. Further effects were glutamine-like metabolomic changes and increased ex-vivo LPS-stimulated cytokine release from healthy donor peripheral blood monocytes. In patients with a history of peritonitis (5 of 20), AlaGln supplementation decreased dialysate interleukin-8 levels. Supplemented PD fluid also attenuated inflammation and enhanced stimulated cytokine release in a mouse model of PD-associated peritonitis.We conclude that AlaGln-supplemented, glucose-based PD fluid can restore peritoneal cellular stress responses with attenuation of sterile inflammation, and may improve peritoneal host-defense in the setting of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2535590849,"The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is currently one of the most popular methods for rigid registration so that it has become the standard in the Robotics and Computer Vision communities. Many applications take advantage of it to align 2D/3D surfaces due to its popularity and simplicity. Nevertheless, some of its phases present a high computational cost thus rendering impossible some of its applications. In this work, it is proposed an efficient approach for the matching phase of the Iterative Closest Point algorithm. This stage is the main bottleneck of that method so that any efficiency improvement has a great positive impact on the performance of the algorithm. The proposal consists in using low computational cost point-to-point distance metrics instead of classic Euclidean one. The candidates analysed are the Chebyshev and Manhattan distance metrics due to their simpler formulation. The experiments carried out have validated the performance, robustness and quality of the proposal. Different experimental cases and configurations have been set up including a heterogeneous set of 3D figures, several scenarios with partial data and random noise. The results prove that an average speed up of 14% can be obtained while preserving the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality of the final results."

These samples showed high contamination with Aspergillus section Nigri species and absence of aflatoxins. To investigate the diversity of secondary metabolites, including mycotoxins, the species of A. section Nigri may produce and thus threaten to contaminate the raw cashew kernels, 150 strains were isolated from cashew samples and assayed for their production of secondary metabolites using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Seven species of black Aspergilli were isolated based on morphological and chemical identification: A. tubingensis (44%), A. niger (32%), A. brasiliensis (10%), A. carbonarius (8.7%), A. luchuensis (2.7%), A. aculeatus (2%) and A. aculeatinus (0.7%). From these, 45 metabolites and their isomers were identified. Aurasperone and pyranonigrin A, produced by all species excluding A. aculeatus and A. aculeatinus, were most prevalent and were encountered in 146 (97.3%) and 145 (95.7%) isolates, respectively. Three mycotoxins groups were detected: fumonisins (B2 and B4) (2.7%) ochratoxin A (13.3%), and secalonic acids (2%), indicating that these mycotoxins could occur in raw cashew nuts. Thirty strains of black Aspergilli were randomly sampled for verification of species identity based on sequences of β-tubulin and calmodulin genes. Among them, 27 isolates were positive to the primers used and 11 were identified as A. niger, 7 as A. tubingensis, 6 as A. carbonarius, 2 as A. luchuensis and 1 as A. welwitschiae confirming the species names as based on morphology and chemical features. These strains clustered in 5 clades in A. section Nigri. Chemical profile clustering also showed also 5 groups confirming the species specific metabolites production."
https://openalex.org/W2536434479,"A variety of commercial analogs and a newer series of Sulindac derivatives were screened for inhibition of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) in vitro and specifically as inhibitors of the essential mycobacterial tubulin homolog, FtsZ. Due to the ease of preparing diverse analogs and a favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of a representative analog, the Sulindac scaffold may be useful for further development against Mtb with respect to in vitro bacterial growth inhibition and selective activity for Mtb FtsZ versus mammalian tubulin. Further discovery efforts will require separating reported mammalian cell activity from both antibacterial activity and inhibition of Mtb FtsZ. Modeling studies suggest that these analogs bind in a specific region of the Mtb FtsZ polymer that differs from human tubulin and, in combination with a pharmacophore model presented herein, future hybrid analogs of the reported active molecules that more efficiently bind in this pocket may improve antibacterial activity while improving other drug characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2536712395,"Globally, road traffic injuries accounted for about 1.36 million deaths in 2015 and are projected to become the fourth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost by 2030. One-fifth of these deaths occurred in South Asia where road traffic injuries are projected to increase by 144% by 2020. Despite this rapidly increasing disease burden there is limited evidence on the economic burden of road traffic injuries on households in South Asia. We applied a novel coarsened exact matching method to assess the household economic burden of road traffic injuries using nationally representative World Health Survey data from five South Asian countries- Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka collected during 2002–2003. We examined the impact of road traffic injuries on household out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending, household non-medical consumption expenditure and the employment status of the traffic injury-affected respondent. We exactly matched a household (after ‘coarsening’) where a respondent reported being involved in a road traffic injury to households where the respondent did not report a road traffic injury on each of multiple observed household characteristics. Our analysis found that road traffic injury-affected households had significantly higher levels of OOP health spending per member (I$0.75, p<0.01), higher OOP spending on drugs per member (I$0.30, p = 0.03), and higher OOP hospital spending per member (I$0.29, p<0.01) in the four weeks preceding the survey. Indicators of “catastrophic spending” were also significantly higher in road traffic injury-affected households: 6.45% (p<0.01) for a threshold of OOP health spending to total household spending ratio of 20%, and 7.40% (p<0.01) for a threshold of OOP health spending to household ‘capacity to pay’ ratio of 40%. However, no statistically significant effects were observed for household non-medical consumption expenditure, and employment status of the road traffic injury-affected individual. Our analysis points to the need for financial risk protection against the road traffic injury-related OOP health expenditure and a focus on prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2535103739,"It has recently been reported that an NR1H3 missense variant, R415Q, causes a novel familial form of multiple sclerosis (Wang et al., 2016a). This claim is at odds with publicly available data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC; http://exac.broadinstitute.org). The allele frequency of R415Q is not significantly higher in cases (0.024%-0.049%) than in ExAC population controls (0.031%), whereas if R415Q conferred even 50% lifetime risk of developing MS, it would be hundreds of times more common in cases than in controls. The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of penetrance for R415Q can be estimated at 2.2% for women and 1.2% for men, indicating that even if this variant is disease associated, individuals harboring the variant would have a lifetime risk of developing MS no higher than a few percent. ExAC data should be considered when evaluating claims of variant pathogenicity. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Wang et al. (2016a), published in Neuron.

https://openalex.org/W2535437562,"Pressure overload is a frequent cause of heart failure. Heart failure affects millions of patients worldwide and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Cell surface proteoglycans are emerging as molecular players in cardiac remodeling, and increased knowledge about their regulation and function is needed for improved understanding of cardiac pathogenesis. Here we investigated glypicans (GPC1-6), a family of evolutionary conserved heparan sulfate proteoglycans anchored to the extracellular leaflet of the cell membrane, in experimental and clinical heart failure, and explored the function of glypican-6 in cardiac cells in vitro. In mice subjected to pressure overload by aortic banding (AB), we observed elevated glypican-6 levels during hypertrophic remodeling and dilated, end-stage heart failure. Consistently, glypican-6 mRNA was elevated in left ventricular myocardium from explanted hearts of patients with end-stage, dilated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Glypican-6 levels correlated negatively with left ventricular ejection fraction in patients, and positively with lung weight after AB in mice. Glypican-6 mRNA was expressed in both cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, and the corresponding protein displayed different sizes in the two cell types due to tissue-specific glycanation. Importantly, adenoviral overexpression of glypican-6 in cultured cardiomyocytes increased protein synthesis and induced mRNA levels of the pro-hypertrophic signature gene ACTA1 and the hypertrophy and heart failure signature genes encoding natriuretic peptides, NPPA and NPPB. Overexpression of GPC6 induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and co-treatment with the ERK inhibitor U0126 attenuated the GPC6-induced increase in NPPA, NPPB and protein synthesis. In conclusion, our data suggests that glypican-6 plays a role in clinical and experimental heart failure progression by regulating cardiomyocyte growth through ERK signaling."

The OAG with normal baseline IOP (IOP ≤ 21 mmHg) subjects were stratified into low-teen OAG (baseline IOP ≤ 15 mmHg) and high-teen OAG (15 mmHg < baseline IOP ≤ 21 mmHg), and the association between blood lead, mercury, and cadmium levels and glaucoma prevalence was assessed for low- and high-teen OAG.The adjusted geometric mean of blood cadmium levels was significantly higher in subjects with low-teen OAG than that of the non-glaucomatous group (P = 0.028), whereas there were no significant differences in blood lead and mercury levels. After adjusting for potential confounders, the low-teen OAG was positively associated with log-transformed blood cadmium levels (OR, 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.93; P = 0.026). For high-teen OAG, log-transformed blood levels of the three heavy metals were not associated with disease prevalence. The association between log-transformed blood cadmium levels and low-teen OAG was significant only in men (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.10-2.48; P = 0.016), and not in women (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.66-1.85; P = 0.709).The results of this study suggest that cadmium toxicity could play a role in glaucoma pathogenesis, particularly in men and in OAG with low-teen baseline IOP."
https://openalex.org/W2538638017,"Background Numerous factor analytic studies consistently support a distinction between two symptom domains of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Both dimensions show high internal consistency and moderate to strong correlations with each other. However, it is not clear what drives this strong correlation. The aim of this paper is to address this issue. Method We applied a sophisticated approach for causal discovery on three independent data sets of scores of the two ADHD dimensions in NeuroIMAGE (total N = 675), ADHD-200 (N = 245), and IMpACT (N = 164), assessed by different raters and instruments, and further used information on gender or a genetic risk haplotype. Results In all data sets we found strong statistical evidence for the same pattern: the clear dependence between hyperactivity/impulsivity symptom level and an established genetic factor (either gender or risk haplotype) vanishes when one conditions upon inattention symptom level. Under reasonable assumptions, e.g., that phenotypes do not cause genotypes, a causal model that is consistent with this pattern contains a causal path from inattention to hyperactivity/impulsivity. Conclusions The robust dependency cancellation observed in three different data sets suggests that inattention is a driving factor for hyperactivity/impulsivity. This causal hypothesis can be further validated in intervention studies. Our model suggests that interventions that affect inattention will also have an effect on the level of hyperactivity/impulsivity. On the other hand, interventions that affect hyperactivity/impulsivity would not change the level of inattention. This causal model may explain earlier findings on heritable factors causing ADHD reported in the study of twins with learning difficulties."
https://openalex.org/W2534514251,"One of the biggest challenges in large-scale conservation is quantifying connectivity at broad geographic scales and for a large set of species. Because connectivity analyses can be computationally intensive, and the planning process quite complex when multiple taxa are involved, assessing connectivity at large spatial extents for many species turns to be often intractable. Such limitation results in that conducted assessments are often partial by focusing on a few key species only, or are generic by considering a range of dispersal distances and a fixed set of areas to connect that are not directly linked to the actual spatial distribution or mobility of particular species. By using a graph theory framework, here we propose an approach to reduce computational effort and effectively consider large assemblages of species in obtaining multi-species connectivity priorities. We demonstrate the potential of the approach by identifying defragmentation priorities in the Italian road network focusing on medium and large terrestrial mammals. We show that by combining probabilistic species graphs prior to conducting the network analysis (i) it is possible to analyse connectivity once for all species simultaneously, obtaining conservation or restoration priorities that apply for the entire species assemblage; and that (ii) those priorities are well aligned with the ones that would be obtained by aggregating the results of separate connectivity analysis for each of the individual species. This approach offers great opportunities to extend connectivity assessments to large assemblages of species and broad geographic scales."
https://openalex.org/W2525950197,"The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of prolonged, intermittent flexion on trunk neuromuscular control. Furthermore, the potential beneficial effects of passive upper body support during flexion were investigated. Twenty one healthy young volunteers participated during two separate visits in which they performed 1 hour of intermittent 60 seconds flexion and 30 seconds rest cycles. Flexion was set at 80% lumbar flexion and was performed with or without upper body support. Before and after intermittent flexion exposure, lumbar range of motion was measured using inertial measurement units and trunk stability was assessed during perturbations applied in the forward direction with a force controlled actuator. Closed-loop system identification was used to determine the trunk translational admittance and reflexes as frequency response functions. The admittance describes the actuator displacement as a function of contact force and to assess reflexes muscle activation was related to actuator displacement. Trunk admittance gain decreased after unsupported flexion, while reflex gain and lumbar range of motion increased after both conditions. Significant interaction effects confirmed a larger increase in lumbar range of motion and reflex gains at most frequencies analysed following unsupported flexion in comparison to supported flexion, probably compensating for decreased passive tissue stiffness. In contrast with some previous studies we found that prolonged intermittent flexion decreased trunk admittance, which implies an increase of the lumped intrinsic and reflexive stiffness. This would compensate for decreased stiffness at the cost of an increase in cumulative low back load. Taking into account the differences between conditions it would be preferable to offer upper body support during activities that require prolonged trunk flexion."
https://openalex.org/W2534963300,"Consumption of foods and beverages with high purine content increases the risk of hyperuricemia, which causes gout and can lead to cardiovascular, renal, and other metabolic disorders. As patients often find dietary restrictions challenging, enzymatically lowering purine content in popular foods and beverages offers a safe and attractive strategy to control hyperuricemia. Here, we report structurally and functionally characterized purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) from Kluyveromyces lactis (KlacPNP), a key enzyme involved in the purine degradation pathway. We report a 1.97 Å resolution crystal structure of homotrimeric KlacPNP with an intrinsically bound hypoxanthine in the active site. KlacPNP belongs to the nucleoside phosphorylase-I (NP-I) family, and it specifically utilizes 6-oxopurine substrates in the following order: inosine > guanosine > xanthosine, but is inactive towards adenosine. To engineer enzymes with broad substrate specificity, we created two point variants, KlacPNPN256D and KlacPNPN256E, by replacing the catalytically active Asn256 with Asp and Glu, respectively, based on structural and comparative sequence analysis. KlacPNPN256D not only displayed broad substrate specificity by utilizing both 6-oxopurines and 6-aminopurines in the order adenosine > inosine > xanthosine > guanosine, but also displayed reversal of substrate specificity. In contrast, KlacPNPN256E was highly specific to inosine and could not utilize other tested substrates. Beer consumption is associated with increased risk of developing gout, owing to its high purine content. Here, we demonstrate that KlacPNP and KlacPNPN256D could be used to catalyze a key reaction involved in lowering beer purine content. Biochemical properties of these enzymes such as activity across a wide pH range, optimum activity at about 25°C, and stability for months at about 8°C, make them suitable candidates for food and beverage industries. Since KlacPNPN256D has broad substrate specificity, a combination of engineered KlacPNP and other enzymes involved in purine degradation could effectively lower the purine content in foods and beverages."

Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with this disease, there remains a need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its etiology and to develop new treatments. Because peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) modulates ethanol-induced hepatic effects, the present study examined alterations in gene expression that may contribute to this disease. Chronic ethanol treatment causes increased hepatic CYP2B10 expression inPparβ/δ+/+ mice but not in Pparβ/δ−/− mice. Nuclear and cytosolic localization of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a transcription factor known to regulate Cyp2b10 expression, was not different between genotypes. PPARγ co-activator 1α, a co-activator of both CAR and PPARβ/δ, was up-regulated in Pparβ/δ+/+ liver following ethanol exposure, but not in Pparβ/δ−/− liver. Functional mapping of the Cyp2b10 promoter and ChIP assays revealed that PPARβ/δ-dependent modulation of SP1 promoter occupancy up-regulated Cyp2b10 expression in response to ethanol. These results suggest that PPARβ/δ regulates Cyp2b10 expression indirectly by modulating SP1 and PPARγ co-activator 1α expression and/or activity independent of CAR activity. Ligand activation of PPARβ/δ attenuates ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 expression in Pparβ/δ+/+ liver but not in Pparβ/δ−/− liver. Strikingly, Cyp2b10 suppression by ligand activation of PPARβ/δ following ethanol treatment occurred in hepatocytes and was mediated by paracrine signaling from Kupffer cells. Combined, results from the present study demonstrate a novel regulatory role of PPARβ/δ in modulating CYP2B10 that may contribute to the etiology of alcoholic liver disease.

Chronic consumption of ethanol causes steatosis, hepatomegaly, hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis collectively referred to as alcoholic liver disease and has become a major health issue because of high morbidity and mortality (1.Dunn W. Shah V.H. Pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.Clin. Liver Dis. 2016; 20: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2.Chacko K.R. Reinus J. Spectrum of alcoholic liver disease.Clin. Liver Dis. 2016; 20: 419-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nutrient deficiencies, impaired fatty acid metabolism, induction of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, and increased oxidative stress are all associated with liver toxicity induced by ethanol (3.Lieber C.S. Relationships between nutrition, alcohol use, and liver disease.Alcohol. Res. Health. 2003; 27: 220-231PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the cause of alcoholic liver disease are not well understood. Nuclear receptors have key roles in regulating lipid homeostasis and inflammation during the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (4.Gyamfi M.A. Wan Y.J.

Health. 2009; 51: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For example, activation of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) 3The abbreviations used are: CAR, constitutive androstane receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PGCα, PPARγ co-activator α; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; qPCR, quantitative real time PCR; ANOVA, analysis of variance. facilitates ethanol metabolism, resulting in enhanced liver damage by increasing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes (6.Chen X. Meng Z. Wang X. Zeng S. Huang W. The nuclear receptor CAR modulates alcohol-induced liver injury.Lab. Invest. 2011; 91: 1136-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By contrast, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) shows a protective role in alcoholic liver disease because ethanol-treated Pparα−/− mice exhibit marked liver damage including hepatomegaly, hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis as compared with ethanol-treated Pparα+/+ mice (7.Nakajima T. Kamijo Y. Tanaka N. Sugiyama E. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Fukushima Y. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Aoyama T. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α protects against alcohol-induced liver damage.Hepatology. 2004; 40: 972-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that PPARβ/δ, another PPAR subtype, prevents ethanol-induced hepatic effects by suppressing lipogenesis, modulating amino acid metabolism, and altering pyridoxal kinase activity (8.Goudarzi M. Koga T. Khozoie C. Mak T.D. Kang B.H. Fornace Jr., A.J. Peters J.M. PPARβ/δ modulates ethanol-induced hepatic effects by decreasing pyridoxal kinase activity.Toxicology. 2013; 311: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous studies showing that PPARβ/δ protects against liver damage induced by various hepatotoxicants (9.Nagasawa T. Inada Y. Nakano S. Tamura T. Takahashi T. Maruyama K.

Sci. 2008; 105: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although the protective role of PPARβ/δ in chemically induced liver toxicity was demonstrated in several models, the detailed molecular mechanism(s) that mediate protection against alcoholic liver disease are not well understood. Thus, the present study focused on identifying and characterizing genes regulated by PPARβ/δ and their roles in alcoholic liver disease. Microarray analysis was performed using liver RNA from Pparβ/δ+/+ and Pparβ/δ−/− mice to identify genes that were differentially regulated by ethanol (see NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database accession number GSE86002). The gene expression profile was markedly different between genotype with distinct changes in gene expression noted in both Pparβ/δ+/+ and Pparβ/δ−/− mice (Fig. 1A). Of particular note was the PPARβ/δ-dependent increase in hepatic Cyp2b10 expression in Pparβ/δ+/+ but not Pparβ/δ−/− mice (Fig. 1A). This was of interest because previous studies demonstrated a similar PPARβ/δ-dependent effect on the hepatic expression of CYP2B10 in mice exposed to carbon tetrachloride (10.Shan W. Nicol C.J. Ito S. Bility M.T. Kennett M.J. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ protects against chemically induced liver toxicity in mice.Hepatology. 2008; 47: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Overall, ethanol exposure significantly altered expression of 358 genes or 146 genes, in livers of Pparβ/δ+/+ or Pparβ/δ−/− mice, respectively (Fig. 1B), with very little overlap between genotypes (76 gene products). Previous work revealed that ligand activation of CAR caused up-regulation of CYP2B10 in both Pparβ/δ+/+ and Pparβ/δ−/− mice (10.Shan W. Nicol C.J. Ito S. Bility M.T. Kennett M.J. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ protects against chemically induced liver toxicity in mice.Hepatology. 2008; 47: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This suggested that CAR activity was not influenced by PPARβ/δ. However, whether PPARβ/δ modulated the ability of CAR to translocate and activate transcription of Cyp2b10 was not examined in the former study. Although expression of Cyp3a11 mRNA in the liver of Pparβ/δ+/+ and Pparβ/δ−/− mice fed ethanol was increased compared with controls, the expression of Cyp2b10 mRNA was increased in the liver of Pparβ/δ+/+ mice but not in Pparβ/δ−/− mice fed ethanol compared with controls (Fig. 2A). Because Cyp2b10 and Cyp3a11 are known target genes of CAR (12.Qatanani M. Moore D.D. CAR, the continuously advancing receptor, in drug metabolism and disease.Curr. Drug Metab. 2005; 6: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), but activating CAR with a ligand is not influenced by PPARβ/δ (10.Shan W. Nicol C.J. Ito S. Bility M.T. Kennett M.J. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ protects against chemically induced liver toxicity in mice.Hepatology. 2008; 47: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the translocation of CAR was determined by quantitative Western blotting analysis. Interestingly, ethanol treatment did not influence the relative nuclear to cytosolic ratio of CAR expression compared with controls in either genotype (Fig. 2B). LAMIN and LDH were used as positive controls for nuclear and cytosolic enrichment. Ethanol treatment caused increased nuclear PGC1α expression in Pparβ/δ+/+ mouse liver but not in Pparβ/δ−/− mouse liver compared with controls (Fig. 3A). Regression analysis revealed that ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 mRNA was positively correlated with higher nuclear PGC1α expression in Pparβ/δ+/+ mouse liver following ethanol treatment (Fig. 3B). However, this correlation was not found in Pparβ/δ−/− mouse liver compared with controls (Fig. 3B). To determine whether PPARβ/δ-dependent PGC1α expression is required for ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 expression, PGC1α was knocked down in primary hepatocytes from Pparβ/δ+/+ and Pparβ/δ−/− mice using siRNA. Quantitative Western blotting analysis confirmed the knockdown of PGC1α expression in hepatocytes from both genotypes and that ethanol increased nuclear PGC1α in Pparβ/δ+/+ mouse hepatocytes but not in Pparβ/δ−/− mouse hepatocytes compared with controls (Fig. 3C). Further, Cyp2b10 mRNA expression was increased in primary Pparβ/δ+/+ mouse hepatocytes by ethanol, but this effect was mitigated when PGC1α expression was knocked down (Fig. 3D). By contrast, ethanol had no effect on Cyp2b10 expression in Pparβ/δ−/− mouse hepatocytes compared with controls, and Cyp2b10 expression was also not influenced by knockdown of PGC1α; with or without ethanol (Fig. 3D). Because nuclear translocation of CAR is not influenced by PPARβ/δ expression, and previous studies demonstrated that ligand activation of CAR in mouse liver is unaffected by PPARβ/δ expression (10.Shan W. Nicol C.J. Ito S. Bility M.T. Kennett M.J. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ protects against chemically induced liver toxicity in mice.Hepatology. 2008; 47: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the ethanol-induced expression of Cyp2b10 is dependent in part on PGC1α and PPARβ/δ. Because the previous results indicate that ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 expression was not mediated by CAR activation, functional mapping of the 5′ upstream region of the Cyp2b10 gene was performed to identify important regulators that may influence ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 expression. Reporter gene assays revealed that the −1 to −500 region of the Cyp2b10 promoter contained critical cis-regulatory elements that were responsive to ethanol exposure (Fig. 4A). The putative trans-acting factors in this region included the octamer-binding transcription factor 1 (OCT1), the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ), and specificity protein 1 (SP1) (Fig. 4B). Mutation of the SP1-binding site in the Cyp2b10 promoter caused decreased luciferase activity following ethanol exposure compared with controls (Fig. 4C). However, this effect was not observed using either mutant OCT1 or mutant C/EBPβ constructs, indicating that these transcription factors are not required for ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 expression (Fig. 4C). A ChIP assay further confirmed that SP1 occupancy on the Cyp2b10 promoter was higher in ethanol-treated Pparβ/δ+/+ mouse hepatocytes compared with control (Fig. 4D). By contrast, SP1 occupancy of the Cyp2b10 promoter was not significantly different in Pparβ/δ−/− mouse hepatocytes treated with or without ethanol (Fig. 4D). To further address the critical role of PPARβ/δ in modulating alcohol-induced liver injury, Pparβ/δ+/+ and Pparβ/δ−/− mice were treated with the PPARβ/δ ligand GW0742 with or without ethanol exposure. Ligand activation of PPARβ/δ, with or without ethanol exposure increased expression of Angptl4 mRNA, a well known PPARβ/δ target gene in Pparβ/δ+/+ mouse liver but not in Pparβ/δ−/− mouse liver (Fig. 5A). Hepatic Cyp2b10 mRNA expression in Pparβ/δ+/+ mice fed the ethanol diet was higher than controls (Fig. 5A). Although ligand activation of PPARβ/δ with GW0742 did not influence the basal level of Cyp2b10 mRNA in Pparβ/δ+/+ liver, ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 mRNA expression was significantly suppressed by ligand activation of PPARβ/δ in Pparβ/δ+/+ mouse liver compared with controls (Fig. 5A). These observations were consistent with quantitative Western blotting analysis, showing that microsomal expression of hepatic CYP2B10 was induced by ethanol treatment in Pparβ/δ+/+ mice, and this induction was diminished by ligand activation of PPARβ/δ (Fig. 5B). No significant changes in hepatic CYP2B10 mRNA and protein expression were observed in any groups of Pparβ/δ−/− mice (Fig. 5). To determine the specific cell types that mediate attenuation of ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 expression in liver, co-cultures of primary hepatocytes, primary non-parenchymal cells or Kupffer cells alone isolated from Pparβ/δ+/+ and Pparβ/δ−/− mice were examined. In the presence or absence of ethanol treatment, ligand activation of PPARβ/δ increased Angptl4 mRNA expression in Pparβ/δ+/+ hepatocytes but not in Pparβ/δ−/− hepatocytes (Fig. 6A). Surprisingly, ligand activation of PPARβ/δ did not suppress ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 mRNA expression in Pparβ/δ+/+ hepatocytes (Fig. 6B), inconsistent with the results observed in vivo (Fig. 5A). Co-culturing primary hepatocytes with non-parenchymal cells revealed that the decrease in ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 mRNA expression following ligand activation of PPARβ/δ was restored and that this rescue was effective when hepatocytes were co-cultured solely with Kupffer cells (Fig. 6, C and D). These changes in Cyp2b10 mRNA expression were not observed in any groups of Pparβ/δ−/− co-cultures (Fig. 6, C and D).FIGURE 6.Paracrine signaling from Kupffer cells is required to modulate PPARβ/δ-dependent expression of Cyp2b10 in hepatocytes.

A previous study revealed that exposure to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) caused an increase in hepatic Cyp2b10 expression, and this induction was mediated by PPARβ/δ, which was not due to differences in the relative expression of CAR (10.Shan W.

The present study also showed that ethanol induced Cyp2b10 expression through a mechanism that required PPARβ/δ. Expression of Cyp2b10 is thought to be mediated by CAR activation (18.Ding X. Lichti K. Kim I. Gonzalez F.J. Staudinger J.L.

However, the present study clearly showed that ethanol treatment did not influence the relative expression of CAR as also observed in a previous study (10.Shan W. Nicol C.J. Ito S. Bility M.T.

Because the translocation of CAR to the nucleus is required to initiate target gene expression (19.Kobayashi K. Sueyoshi T. Inoue K. Moore R. Negishi M.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), this illustrates a unique finding from the present study because the results indicate that PPARβ/δ, rather than CAR, is required for up-regulation of Cyp2b10 in response to ethanol. This is similar to the PPARβ/δ-dependent up-regulation of hepatic Cyp2b10 observed following treatment with CCl4, and the fact that ligand activation of CAR caused up-regulation of Cyp2b10 in both Pparβ/δ+/+ and Pparβ/δ−/− mouse liver (10.Shan W. Nicol C.J. Ito S. Bility M.T. Kennett M.J. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Peters J.M. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ protects against chemically induced liver toxicity in mice.Hepatology. 2008; 47: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). An alternative pathway that could be influenced by PPARβ/δ that impacts CAR activity is the relative expression of PGC1α. It is known that PPARβ/δ regulates PGC1α expression (22.Hondares E. Pineda-Torra I. Iglesias R. Staels B. Villarroya F. Giralt M. PPARδ, but not PPARα, activates PGC-1α gene transcription in muscle.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and that CAR requires PGC1α as a co-activator to remodel chromatin of target genes (23.Corton J.C. Brown-Borg H.M. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 in caloric restriction and other models of longevity.J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2005; 60: 1494-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated that nuclear PGC1α level was increased by ethanol treatment, and this increased expression of PGC1α requires PPARβ/δ. Indeed, PPARβ/δ-dependent expression of PGC1α is required for the increase in ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 expression because knocking down PGC1α prevented this effect in wild-type hepatocytes. This is the first study to demonstrate the essential role of PPARβ/δ-dependent expression of PGC1α in regulating Cyp2b10 expression in response to ethanol exposure. These findings suggest that one mechanism that may mediate the PPARβ/δ-dependent expression of Cyp2b10 is via modulation of PGC1α, which is required for CAR activation. The present studies strongly support this notion, but further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis. Interestingly, the basal level of Cyp2b10 mRNA expression was not altered by knocking down PGC1α compared with controls, suggesting that PGC1α is not critical for regulating constitutive Cyp2b10 expression. In addition to CAR, the transcription factor SP1 also regulates Cyp2b1 expression in rat hepatocytes (24.Muangmoonchai R. Smirlis D. Wong S.C. Edwards M. Phillips I.R. Shephard E.A. Xenobiotic induction of cytochrome P450 2B1 (CYP2B1) is mediated by the orphan nuclear receptor constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and requires steroid co-activator 1 (SRC-1) and the transcription factor Sp1.Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The present study revealed that ethanol-induced increased promoter occupancy of SP1 on the Cyp2b10 gene, and this effect required the expression of PPARβ/δ. Examination of the microarray data did not indicate an increase in the expression of Sp1 mRNA. However, PGC1α can also increase SP1-mediated gene expression by either increasing SP1 expression or enhancing the recruitment of SP1 to the transcription complex (25.Shin S.W. Yun S.H. Park E.S. Jeong J.S. Kwak J.Y. Park J.I. Overexpression of PGC1α enhances cell proliferation and tumorigenesis of HEK293 cells through the upregulation of Sp1 and Acyl-CoA binding protein.Int. J. Oncol. 2015; 46: 1328-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26.Salatino S. Kupr B. Baresic M. van Nimwegen E. Handschin C. The genomic context and corecruitment of SP1 affect ERRα coactivation by PGC-1α in muscle cells.Mol. Endocrinol. 2016; 30: 809-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the PPARβ/δ-dependent expression of PGC1α induced by ethanol may also indirectly regulate Cyp2b10 expression by influencing the occupancy of SP1 on the Cyp2b10 promoter. Because expression of CYPs is known to be involved in alcoholic liver disease in part because of the generation of metabolites such as reactive oxygen species, the finding that ligand activation of PPARβ/δ significantly suppressed ethanol-induced hepatic CYP2B10 expression suggests a protective role of PPARβ/δ in alcoholic liver disease. Indeed, recent studies have shown that PPARβ/δ protects against alcoholic liver disease by inhibiting steatosis, amino acid metabolism, and pyridoxal phosphate activity (8.Goudarzi M. Koga T. Khozoie C. Mak T.D. Kang B.H. Fornace Jr., A.J. Peters J.M. PPARβ/δ modulates ethanol-induced hepatic effects by decreasing pyridoxal kinase activity.Toxicology. 2013; 311: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Similarly, ligand activation of PPARβ/δ restores insulin sensitivity and also protects against ethanol-induced liver injury (17.Pang M. de la Monte S.M. Longato L. Tong M. He J. Chaudhry R. Duan K. Ouh J. Wands J.R. PPARδ agonist attenuates alcohol-induced hepatic insulin resistance and improves liver injury and repair.J. Hepatol. 2009; 50: 1192-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, ligand activation of PPARβ/δ did not prevent ethanol-induced Cyp2b10 mRNA expression in primary hepatocytes alone. By contrast, ligand activation of PPARβ/δ repression of Cyp2b10 expression induced by ethanol is restored when primary hepatocytes are co-cultured with Kupffer cells. This suggests that PPARβ/δ in the Kupffer cell may function differently than in the hepatocyte. For example, PPARβ/δ can modulate gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors and/or by directly regulating target gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 27.Peters J.M. Foreman J.E.

Indeed, PPARβ/δ expression in Kupffer cells can modulate effects observed during inflammatory insults in the liver that impact the hepatocyte (28.Balandaram G. Kramer L.R. Kang B.H. Murray I.A.

Further studies are needed to delineate the specific activities of PPARβ/δ in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes that underlie these differences. To date, this is the first demonstration that Kupffer cell activity is required for a protective effect in hepatocytes by facilitating repression of CYP2B10, whose expression is dependent on PPARβ/δ. This suggests that paracrine signaling between the Kupffer cell and hepatocyte may be important for preventing alcoholic liver disease through a PPARβ/δ-dependent mechanism.

Previous studies showed aberrant expression of Srpr in several cell types with abnormal growth rate. Although Srpr is expressed in various tissues including skin, the role of Srpr in keratinocytes and regulation of its expression by miRNAs have not been studied. In this study, we investigated the role of SRPR and regulation of its expression by miRNA in skin keratinocytes. We found that SRPR was highly expressed in epidermal keratinocytes and regulated keratinocyte proliferation by affecting cell cycle progression. We also demonstrated that miR-330-5p directly inhibits Srpr expression. These data suggest that miR-330-5p-mediated regulation of the SRPR level is needed for the regulation of proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2536489628,"Background Patients who are newly screened HIV positive by EIA are lost to follow-up due to complicated HIV testing procedures. Because this is the first step in care, it affects the entire continuum of care. This is a particular concern in rural China. Objective(s) To assess the routine HIV testing completeness and treatment initiation rates at 18 county-level general hospitals in rural Guangxi. Methods We reviewed original hospital HIV screening records. Investigators also engaged with hospital leaders and key personnel involved in HIV prevention activities to characterize in detail the routine care practices in place at each county. Results 699 newly screened HIV-positive patients between January 1 and June 30, 2013 across the 18 hospitals were included in the study. The proportion of confirmatory testing across the 18 hospitals ranged from 14% to 87% (mean of 43%), and the proportion of newly diagnosed individuals successfully initiated antiretroviral treatment across the hospitals ranged from 3% to 67% (mean of 23%). The average interval within hospitals for individuals to receive the Western Blot (WB) and CD4 test results from HIV positive screening (i.e. achieving testing completion) ranged from 14–116 days (mean of 41.7 days) across the hospitals. The shortest interval from receiving a positive EIA screening test result to receiving WB and CD4 testing and counseling was 0 day and the longest was 260 days. Conclusion The proportion of patients newly screened HIV positive that completed the necessary testing procedures for HIV confirmation and received ART was very low. Interventions are urgently needed to remove barriers so that HIV patients can have timely access to HIV/AIDS treatment and care in rural China."
https://openalex.org/W2537210273,"Background Breast cancer is the most common incident form of cancer in women including different subtypes. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been confirmed to exist in breast cancer. But the research on the origin of breast cancer subtype stem cells (BCSSCs) is still inadequate. Methods We identified the putative origin cells of BCSSCs through comparing gene signatures between BCSSCs and normal mammary cells from multiple perspectives: common signature, expression consistency, functional similarity and shortest path length. First, the potential origin cells were ranked according to these measures separately. Then Q statistic was employed to combine all rank lists into a unique list for each subtype, to prioritize the origin cells for each BCSSC. Next, we identified origin-related gene modules through integrating functional interaction network with differentially expressed genes. Finally, transcription factors of significant gene modules were predicted by MatchTM. Results The results showed that Luminal A CSC was most relevant to luminal progenitor cell or mature luminal cell; luminal B and HER2 CSC were most relevant to bipotent-enriched progenitor cell; basal-like CSC was most relevant to bipotent-enriched progenitor cell or mature luminal cell. Network modules analysis revealed genes related to mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) were significantly dysregulated during the origin of luminal B CSC. In addition, SOX10 emerged as a key regulator of MRC. Conclusions Our study supports substantive evidence for the possible origin of four kinds of BCSSCs. Dysfunction of MRC may contribute to the origin of luminal B CSC. These findings may have important implications to treat and prevent breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2538567638,"Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV remains a major source of new HIV infections in children. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) using lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART) for all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV (Option B+) is the major strategy for eliminating paediatric HIV. Ensuring that patients are satisfied with PMTCT services is important for optimizing uptake, adherence and retention in treatment.We conducted a facility based quantitative cross-sectional survey in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, between March and April 2014, when the country was transitioning to the implementation of PMTCT Option B+. We interviewed 595 pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, who received PMTCT care in 36 public health facilities. Predictors of overall dissatisfaction with PMTCT services were identified using a multiple logistic regression.Overall 8% of the patients expressed dissatisfaction with PMTCT services. Patients who perceived health care workers (HCW) communication skills as poor, had a 5-fold (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.8-13.4) increased risk of dissatisfaction and those who perceived HCW capacity to understand client concerns as poor, had a 6-fold (OR 5.7, 95% CI 2.3-14.0) increased risk. Having a total visit time longer than two hours was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of being dissatisfied (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.7). Every 30-minute increment in total visit time was associated with a 10% higher (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2) risk of being dissatisfied. The probability of being dissatisfied ranged from 4% (95% CI 2% - 6%) in the presence of patient-perceived good communication, good understanding of patient concerns, and a total visit time below two hours, to 70% (95% CI 47% - 86%) if HCW failed in all of these aspects.Patient dissatisfaction with PMTCT services was generally low; reflecting that quality of care was maintained during Tanzania's transition to Option B+ strategy aiming to increase the number of women initiating life-long ART in PMTCT clinics. Improved HCW communication with clients, their understanding of patient concerns and a reduction of the total visit time would further optimize women's overall satisfaction with PMTCT services in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W2539267004,"The schedule of urban road network recovery caused by rainstorms, snow, and other bad weather conditions, traffic incidents, and other daily events is essential. However, limited studies have been conducted to investigate this problem. We fill this research gap by proposing an optimal schedule for urban road network repair with limited repair resources based on the greedy algorithm. Critical links will be given priority in repair according to the basic concept of the greedy algorithm. In this study, the link whose restoration produces the ratio of the system-wide travel time of the current network to the worst network is the minimum. We define such a link as the critical link for the current network. We will re-evaluate the importance of damaged links after each repair process is completed. That is, the critical link ranking will be changed along with the repair process because of the interaction among links. We repair the most critical link for the specific network state based on the greedy algorithm to obtain the optimal schedule. The algorithm can still quickly obtain an optimal schedule even if the scale of the road network is large because the greedy algorithm can reduce computational complexity. We prove that the problem can obtain the optimal solution using the greedy algorithm in theory. The algorithm is also demonstrated in the Sioux Falls network. The problem discussed in this paper is highly significant in dealing with urban road network restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2536996780,"Several maternal and birth characteristics have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of many childhood cancers. Our goal was to evaluate the risk of childhood embryonal solid tumors in relation to pre- and perinatal characteristics.A case-cohort study was performed using two population-based datasets, which were linked through R software. Tumors were classified as central nervous system (CNS) or non-CNS-embryonal (retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, renal tumors, germ cell tumors, hepatoblastoma and soft tissue sarcoma). Children aged <6 years were selected. Adjustments were made for potential confounders. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed by unconditional logistic regression analysis using SPSS.Males, high maternal education level, and birth anomalies were independent risk factors. Among children diagnosed older than 24 months of age, cesarean section (CS) was a significant risk factor. Five-minute Apgar ≤8 was an independent risk factor for renal tumors. A decreasing risk with increasing birth order was observed for all tumor types except for retinoblastoma. Among children with neuroblastoma, the risk decreased with increasing birth order (OR = 0.82 (95% CI 0.67-1.01)). Children delivered by CS had a marginally significantly increased OR for all tumors except retinoblastoma. High maternal education level showed a significant increase in the odds for all tumors together, CNS tumors, and neuroblastoma.This evidence suggests that male gender, high maternal education level, and birth anomalies are risk factors for childhood tumors irrespective of the age at diagnosis. Cesarean section, birth order, and 5-minute Apgar score were risk factors for some tumor subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2532351659,"The RGD-toxin protein Lj-RGD3 is a naturally occurring 118 amino acid peptide that can be obtained from the salivary gland of the Lampetra japonica fish. This unique peptide contains 3 RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motifs in its primary structure. Lj-RGD3 is available in recombinant form (rLj-RGD3) and can be produced in large quantities using DNA recombination techniques. The pharmacology of the three RGD motif-containing peptides has not been studied. This study investigated the protective effects of rLj-RGD3, a novel polypeptide, against ischemia/reperfusion-induced damage to the brain caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in a rat stroke model. We also explored the mechanism by which rLj-RGD3 acts by measuring protein and mRNA expression levels, with an emphasis on the FAK and integrin-PI3K/Akt anti-apoptosis pathways.rLj-RGD3 was obtained from the buccal secretions of Lampetra japonica using gene recombination technology. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the following seven groups: a sham group; a vehicle-treated (VT) group; 100.0 μg·kg-1, 50.0 μg·kg-1 and 25.0 μg·kg-1 dose rLj-RGD3 groups; and two positive controls, including 1.5 mg·kg-1 Edaravone (ED) and 100.0 μg·kg-1 Eptifibatide (EP). MCAO was induced using a model consisting of 2 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Behavioral changes were observed in the normal and operation groups after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was applied. In addition, behavioral scores were evaluated at 4 and 24 h after reperfusion. Brain infarct volumes were determined based on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Pathological changes in brain tissues were observed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Moreover, neuronal apoptosis was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays. We determined the expression levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt, PKB), caspase-3 and Bcl-2 in the brain using western blot analysis and RT-PCR assays. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Dalian Medical University.The behavioral scores and cerebral infarct volumes of the rLj-RGD3 groups were markedly lower at 4 and 24 h/RF. The rLj-RGD3 protein significantly ameliorated pathological changes in the brain and reduced the number of apoptotic neurons. Furthermore, the FAK and PI3K/Akt pathways were activated. rLj-RGD3 significantly increased the expression of FAK, p-FAK and Bcl-2 proteins. In contrast, caspase-3 expression was inhibited.We conclude that recombinant Lampetra japonica RGD-peptide (rLj-RGD3) exerts a protective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in the brain. In addition, the mechanism of this protection is associated with the activation of the integrin-PI3K/Akt pathway. These results provide a theoretical foundation and an experimental basis for using RGD peptides as novel drugs for treating ischemic cerebral vascular diseases in addition to promoting the research and development of marine biotechnology drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2533640667,"To study the diagnostic properties of hand/wrist and body measures according to validated clinical and electrophysiological carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) severity scales.We performed a prospective case-control study. For each case, two controls were enrolled. Two five-stage clinical and electrophysiological scales were used to evaluate CTS severity. Anthropometric measurements were collected and obesity indicators and hand/wrist ratios were calculated. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated separately by gender.We consecutively enrolled 370 cases and 747 controls. The wrist-palm ratio, waist-hip-height ratio and waist-stature ratio showed the highest proportion of cases with abnormal values in the severe stages of CTS for clinical and electrophysiological severity scales in both genders. Accuracy tended to increase with CTS severity for females and males. In severe stage, most of the indexes presented moderate accuracy in both genders. Among subjects with severe CTS, the wrist-palm ratio presented the highest AUC for hand measures in the clinical and electrophysiological severity scales both in females (AUC 0.83 and 0.76, respectively) and males (AUC 0.91 and 0.82, respectively). Among subjects with severe CTS, the waist-stature ratio showed the highest AUC for body measures in the clinical and electrophysiological severity scales both in females (AUC 0.78 and 0.77, respectively) and males (AUC 0.84 and 0.76, respectively). The results of waist-hip-height ratio AUC were similar.Wrist-palm ratio, waist-hip-height ratio and waist-stature ratio could contribute to support the diagnostic hypothesis of severe CTS that however has to be confirmed by nerve conduction study."

Cytoskeletal regulation is governed largely by the precise temporal and spatial modulation of the small G-proteins of the Rho family (Rho GTPases), RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 (1.Hall A. Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton.Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases function as molecular switches. They are converted from the GDP-bound inactive form to a GTP-bound active state by a reaction catalyzed by Rho GTPase-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs). 4The abbreviations used are: RhoGEF, Rho GTPase-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; RGS, regulator of G-protein signaling; aa, amino acid(s); NLS, nuclear localization sequence; mAG, monomeric Azami Green. RhoGEFs are large multidomain proteins that are tightly regulated to control their function. RhoGEFs can be subdivided into two main subfamilies. First, there are those that possess a Dbl homology (DH) domain that is found in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This subfamily is currently represented by 70 members in mammalian genomes (2.Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. GEF means go: turning on RHO GTPases with guanine nucleotide-exchange factors.Nat. Rev.

Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Second, there are Dock180-related proteins containing the Dock homology region-2 domain (also known as the Docker-ZH2 domain), which form a subfamily of 11 mammalian members (4.Meller N. Merlot S. Guda C. CZH proteins: a new family of Rho-GEFs.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4937-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The DH domain is responsible for catalytic activity, and the PH domain directs subcellular localization and can modulate the DH domain function. A number of the DH domain-containing RhoGEFs, including PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-RhoGEF, leukemia-associated RhoGEF, and p115-RhoGEF, have a regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domain in addition to a DH domain and PH domain. PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG also have a PDZ domain. These RhoGEFs are regulated by activated Gα12/13 subunits through their interaction with the RGS domain to activate GDP/GTP exchange activity for RhoA (5.Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T.

In contrast, P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 are regulated by Gβγ subunits and polyphosphoinositide through direct interaction to activate the GDP/GTP exchange activity for Rac (8.Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J.

We reported that one novel RhoGEF, PLEKHG2/FLJ00018, was activated by direct interaction with Gβγ subunits and regulated cell spreading through the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 (9.Ueda H. Nagae R.

We also reported that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLEKHG2 by the EphB2/cSrc pathway induced an interaction between PLEKHG2 and PIK3R3 (11.Sato K. Suzuki T. Yamaguchi Y. Kitade Y. Nagase T. Ueda H. PLEKHG2/FLJ00018, a Rho family-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is tyrosine phosphorylated via the EphB2/cSrc signaling pathway.Cell. Signal. 2014; 26: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Finally, we demonstrated that PLEKHG2 interacted with β-actin and γ-actin and that both β- and γ-actin acted as negative regulators of PLEKHG2 (12.Sato K. Handa H. Kimura M. Okano Y. Nagaoka H. Nagase T. Sugiyama T. Kitade Y. Ueda H. Identification of a Rho family specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, FLJ00018, as a novel actin-binding protein.Cell. Signal. 2013; 25: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the details underlying the molecular mechanisms of PLEKHG2 activation have yet to be elucidated. In light of the above findings, PLEKHG2 is thought to regulate actin reorganization by Rho through various intercellular signal pathways, including the G protein-coupled receptor pathway. In the present study, using two-hybrid screening, we demonstrated that a zinc finger domain-containing protein, four-and-a-half LIM domains 1 (FHL1), acts as a binding partner of PLEKHG2. Our findings suggested that the binding with FHL1 positively regulated the activity of PLEKHG2 and the morphological changes of cells. We previously investigated the binding partners of the N-terminal region of PLEKHG2 (amino acids (aa) 1–465) using yeast two-hybrid screening. Among 128 positive clones, 24 clones showed high homology (>80%) to genes in the database (12.Sato K. Handa H. Kimura M. Okano Y. Nagaoka H. Nagase T. Sugiyama T. Kitade Y. Ueda H. Identification of a Rho family specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, FLJ00018, as a novel actin-binding protein.Cell. Signal. 2013; 25: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of one of the positive clones was identical to aa 111–323 of FHL1B. In vertebrates, there are three FHL1 isoforms: FHL1A, FHL1B, and FHL1C. FHL1A is characterized by an N-terminal half-LIM domain followed by four complete LIM domains. FHL1B has an initial three and one-half N-terminal LIM domains that are identical to those of FHL1A as well as a novel C-terminal sequence including three functional nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) and a nuclear export sequence. FHL1C has an initial two and a half N-terminal LIM domains that are identical to those of FHL1A. In general, it is thought that LIM domains mediate protein-protein interactions that are critical to cellular processes (13.Kadrmas J.L. Beckerle M.C. The LIM domain: from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 920-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The prey amino acid sequence contains the sequences of the C-terminal part of the second LIM domain and the third LIM domain of FHL1A and FHL1B (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate the interaction of PLEKHG2 with FHL1A or FHL1B in mammalian cells, we co-transfected expression vectors of PLEKHG2 and FHL1A or FHL1B into HEK293 cells. After transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with PLEKHG2, FHL1A and FHL1B were co-immunoprecipitated with PLEKHG2. However, PLEKHG2 bound more strongly with FHL1A than FHL1B in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B). FHL1B has an NLS, and it is thought that FHL1B is located in the nucleus (14.Brown S. McGrath M.J. Ooms L.M. Gurung R. Maimone M.M. Mitchell C.A. Characterization of two isoforms of the skeletal muscle LIM protein 1, SLIM1: localization of SLIM1 at focal adhesions and the isoform slimmer in the nucleus of myoblasts and cytoplasm of myotubes suggests distinct roles in the cytoskeleton and in nuclear-cytoplasmic communication.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27083-27091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, PLEKHG2 is thought to act mainly at the cytosol. It seems that the PLEKHG2 cannot gain access to the FHL1B. This might result in a weak binding of these two proteins. Indeed, most of the FHL1B was eliminated as a lysis buffer-insoluble fraction that included insoluble proteins and nuclear proteins (Fig. 1B). Next, to examine whether FHL1A and FHL1B interacted with regions other than aa 1–465 of PLEKHG2, cells were co-transfected with PLEKHG2 ΔNT and FHL1A or FHL1B. PLEKHG2 ΔNT was immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc antibody, and both the FHL1A and FHL1B isoforms were detected in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1, C and D). The level of FHL1A or FHL1B co-immunoprecipitated with PLEKHG2 ΔNT was the same as that co-immunoprecipitated with the PLEKHG2 WT. We suspect that the binding regions may also be present in the ΔNT region of PLEKHG2. The interaction of PLEKHG2 P2 and FHL1 was much stronger than the interaction of the PLEKHG2 WT and FHL1. We and other researchers showed that the C terminus of PLEKHG2 interacted with the N terminus of PLEKHG2 (9.Ueda H. Nagae R. Kozawa M. Morishita R. Kimura S. Nagase T. Ohara O. Yoshida S. Asano T.

Cell Biol. 2013; 33: 4294-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We consider that when PLEKHG2 was activated, the C terminus region of PLEKHG2 opened, and the DH domain at the N terminus region exerted some activity. Perhaps, when PLEKHG2 was activated, PLEKHG2 remained as a stable form in the cells. The fact that PLEKHG2 P2 and PLEKHG2 ΔNT interacted with FHL1 suggests that this interaction might have physiological meaning in mammalian cells. To detect the FHL1-binding region of PLEKHG2, we performed co-immunoprecipitation with various deletion mutants of PLEKHG2 (Fig. 2A). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the deletion mutants of PLEKHG2 and FLAG-tagged FHL1A. As shown in Fig. 2B, FHL1A was co-immunoprecipitated with P2 (aa 1–464) and P2ΔN1 (aa 58–464). However, P2ΔN2 (aa 150–464) and P2ΔN3 (aa 283–464) showed little co-immunoprecipitation with FHL1A. We also examined the C terminus region-deleted mutants of the P2 mutant (Fig. 2C). FHL1A was co-immunoprecipitated with P2ΔC1 (aa 1–441), P2ΔC2 (aa 1–355), and P2ΔC3 (aa 1–310). However, PH (aa 283–441) showed little co-immunoprecipitation with FHL1A. These results suggested that the amino acid region 58–150 of PLEKHG2 is an FHL1-binding region in PLEKHG2. To examine whether the expression of FHL1 influences PLEKHG2 functions in cells, we measured the transcription of an SRE-controlled reporter gene that is known to be induced by Rho family activation (16.Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. The Rho family GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42Hs regulate transcriptional activation by SRF.Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the PLEKHG2 WT and FHL1A enhanced PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription. In contrast, the co-expression of PLEKHG2 with FHL1B was almost not affected (Fig. 3, A and B). Co-expression of the PLEKHG2 P2 mutant and FHL1A or FHL1B yielded similar results (Fig. 3, A and B). As mentioned above, we previously reported that PLEKHG2 is activated by Gβγ to increase SRE-dependent gene transcription through the activation of Rac and Cdc42 (9.Ueda H. Nagae R. Kozawa M. Morishita R. Kimura S. Nagase T. Ohara O. Yoshida S. Asano T. Heterotrimeric G protein βγ subunits stimulate FLJ00018, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 and Cdc42.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1946-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To examine whether the expression of FHL1 influences PLEKHG2 functions in the presence of Gβγ, the PLEKHG2 WT or P2 and FHL1A or FHL1B with or without Gβγ were co-transfected into cells. Co-expression of PLEKHG2 and Gβγ with FHL1A synergistically enhanced PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 4, A–C). In contrast, the co-expression of FHL1B was almost unaffected (Fig. 4, A–C). Co-expression of the PLEKHG2 P2 mutant and FHL1A or FHL1B with or without Gβγ yielded similar results (Fig. 4, D–F). These results suggested that FHL1A acts as a positive regulator of PLEKHG2 in mammalian cells. To examine why PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription is synergistically enhanced in PLEKHG2-, FHL1A-, and Gβγ-expressing cells, we investigated the interaction of PLEKHG2 with FHL1 and Gβγ in the cells by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. PLEKHG2 was immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc antibody, and FHL1A (Fig. 5A, lane 2) and Gβ (Fig. 5B, lane 2) were detected in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitate. When we transfected Gβγ in addition to PLEKHG2 and FHL1A, Gβγ interacted with PLEKHG2 (Fig. 5A, lane 3). However, comparing the results in lanes 2 and 3 of Fig. 5A, it can be seen that the levels of the PLEKHG2 and FHL1A interaction were not altered by Gβγ expression, and vice versa (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 3). In addition, FLAG-tagged-FHL1A was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody as a reverse immunoprecipitation, and PLEKHG2 was detected in the immunoprecipitant by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5C, lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, FLAG-tagged-FHL1A was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody, and Gβγ was detected in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitant (Fig. 5C, lanes 1 and 2). These results suggest that PLEKHG2, FHL1A, and Gβγ form a complex in the co-expressing cells. This complex formation appeared to be related to the synergistic enhancement of SRE-dependent gene transcription. We recently reported that the interaction of PLEKHG2 with non-muscle actin attenuated PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription (12.Sato K. Handa H. Kimura M. Okano Y. Nagaoka H. Nagase T. Sugiyama T. Kitade Y. Ueda H. Identification of a Rho family specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, FLJ00018, as a novel actin-binding protein.Cell. Signal. 2013; 25: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of non-muscle actin on the enhancement of PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription by the co-expression of FHL1A, PLEKHG2, FHL1A, and β-actin were co-expressed in the cells. The co-expression of β-actin with PLEKHG2 and FHL1A attenuated the PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 6, A and B). These results suggest that β-actin interacted with a region different from the FHL1-binding region of PLEKHG2 and that this interaction inhibited the function of PLEKHG2.FIGURE 6.β-Actin inhibited the FHL1A-activated, PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription. A, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pSRE.L-luciferase, pRL-SV40, PLEKHG2, FHL1A, and β-actin, as indicated. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection, and the effect of FHL1 protein on PLEKHG2-induced transcription was analyzed by a luciferase reporter gene assay. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the values are the means ± S.D. (error bars) The data shown are representative of three independent experiments. B, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with PLEKHG2, FHL1A, and β-actin, as indicated.

PLEK2, PLEKHG2. IB, immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that FHL1 and PLEKHG2 interacted and functioned in the cells, we used genome-editing tools and generated FHL1-knock-out cells. Anti-FHL1 antibody could detect both the exogenous FHL1A and endogenous FHL1A in HEK293 cells (Fig. 7A). Although anti-FHL1 antibody could detect transfected FHL1B, it failed to detect endogenous FHL1B in HEK293 cells. For this reason, it was thought that HEK293 cells express endogenous FHL1A but not FHL1B (Fig. 7A). We also checked the cells of a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro-2a. However, we could not detect endogenous FHL1A and FHL1B in these cells. Using mouse tissue, we confirmed that this antibody is capable of detecting FHL1B and FHL1A (data not shown). Next, we tried to knock out endogenous FHL1 protein in HEK293 cells. We constructed two CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids at FHL1 exons 2 and 3 to delete this region (Fig. 7B). After introducing CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids, the cells were single cell-sorted. Cloned cells were checked by PCR analysis (Fig. 7C). From the immunoblot analysis, we confirmed that the knock-out cells did not express the FHL1A protein (Fig. 7D). To the best of our knowledge, no PLEKHG2 antibody with a capacity for immunoprecipitation has been identified. To examine whether endogenous FHL1A interacts with PLEKHG2, we transfected Myc-tagged PLEKHG2 into wild type cells and knock-out cells. In the wild type cells, endogenous FHL1 was co-precipitated with Myc-tagged PLEKHG2, and this interaction did not appear in knock-out cells (Fig. 8A). This result suggested that PLEKHG2 might interact with FHL1 in HEK293 cells. Next, we performed an SRE-dependent gene transcription assay to reveal the effect of FHL1 on the PLEKHG2 signaling. Consistent with the other results, Gβγ enhanced PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription. In contrast, the level of enhancement of SRE-dependent gene transcription was much lower in Gβγ- and PLEKHG2-transfected FHL1-knock-out cells (Fig. 8B). Enforced expression of FHL1 in FHL1-knock-out cells rescued the Gβγ- and PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 8, C and D). Although it is still unclear whether FHL1 functions by interacting directly with PLEKHG2 and Gβγ, this result indicates that FHL1 plays an important role in Gβγ- and PLEKHG2-induced signaling. We subjected a fetal brain cDNA library to yeast two-hybrid screening to find the binding partner of PLEKHG2, and we used a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro-2a, to examine the cellular localization and cell morphological changes of PLEKHG2 and its binding partners to determine their functional meanings. First, we confirmed that FHL1A interacted with PLEKHG2 in Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 9A) and that FHL1A enhanced PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 9, B and C). FHL1B interacted with PLEKHG2 in Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 9D). However, FHL1B failed to activate PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 9, E and F). These results are consistent with the results we obtained using HEK293 cells. From these observations, we speculate that FHL1A activates PLEKHG2 in Neuro-2a cells, using the same system as in HEK293 cells. Next, to reveal the effect of PLEKHG2 and FHL1A on the cell morphology, we co-transfected mAG-tagged PLEKHG2, FLAG-tagged FHL1A, FLAG-tagged FHL1B, and Gβγ. FHL1B was localized at the center of the cell. It appeared not to co-localize with PLEKHG2 (Fig. 10B). When co-expressing FHL1B and PLEKHG2, the cells were slightly spread. When the cells co-expressed FHL1B, PLEKHG2, and Gβγ, the spreading effect was enhanced. However, based on our observation that the spread cells were also present among cells that expressed PLEKHG2 or PLEKHG2 and Gβγ (Fig. 10A), it appears that this effect was not caused by FHL1B. On the other hand, when we co-transfected with PLEKHG2, FHL1A, and Gβγ, FHL1A was stained throughout the cell. In addition, neurite-like shapes were observed in the PLEKHG2-, FHL1A-, and Gβγ-transfected cells (Fig. 10C). We performed further analysis to confirm that the neurite-like structure of the FHL1A-, PLEKHG2-, and Gβγ-transfected cells was truly different from the cell morphology of the PLEKHG2- and Gβγ-transfected cells. Using ImageJ software, we measured the length and number of cell protrusions (Fig. 10, D and E). In the cells expressing PLEKHG2, Gβγ, and FHL1A, both the length and number of cell protrusions were increased from the PLEKHG2- and Gβγ-expressing cells. Because we were unable to detect endogenous FHL1 expression in Neuro-2a cells, we could not examine the relationship between the signal enhancement and this morphological change. However, this result supports the notion that the expressions of FLH1A, PLEKHG2, and Gβγ can promote the morphological change. The results of this study revealed that a zinc finger LIM domain-containing protein, FHL1, interacted with PLEKHG2. FHL1s are divided into mainly three isoforms: FHL1A, FHL1B, and FHL1C. The results of the yeast two-hybrid screening suggested that PLEKHG2 interacted with LIM2 and LIM3. Although both FHL1A and FHL1B have LIM2 and LIM3, PLEKHG2 was bound more strongly with FHL1A. FHL1B has an NLS. It seems that most of the FHL1B protein was localized in the nucleus. For this reason, we speculate that it is difficult for PLEKHG2 to gain access to the FHL1B. This is consistent with our finding that FHL1B was stained at the center of the cells, whereas PLEKHG2 was stained at the cytosol in Neuro-2a cells. It was previously reported that FHL1B was localized at the cytosol during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. FHL1B interacts with protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit β during this phase to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (17.Wong C.H. Fung Y.W. Ng E.K. Lee S.M. Waye M.M. Tsui S.K. LIM domain protein FHL1B interacts with PP2A catalytic β subunit: a novel cell cycle regulatory pathway.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 4511-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is possible that PLEKHG2 interacts with FHL1B only at a specific time point in the cell cycle and may play one or more specific roles. Further analysis is necessary. The binding region of FHL1 and PLEKHG2 exists within aa 58–150 of PLEKHG2. In this paper, we used various deletion mutants to analyze the binding region. One of the mutants, PLEKHG2 ΔN2, is missing parts of the DH domain. We cannot exclude the possibility that this mutant generates a misfolded protein. However, in our previous paper (9.Ueda H. Nagae R. Kozawa M. Morishita R. Kimura S. Nagase T. Ohara O. Yoshida S. Asano T. Heterotrimeric G protein βγ subunits stimulate FLJ00018, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 and Cdc42.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1946-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we used another DH domain deletion mutant and found that this mutant still functioned as a Gβγ-binding protein (PLEKHG2 p5, aa 1–108; PLEKHG2 p6, aa 1–149; PLEKHG2 p7, aa 1–134). From this observation, we considered that the PLEKHG2 ΔN2 mutant still maintains its conformation, at least in terms of protein-protein interaction. The FHL1A-binding region of PLEKHG2 was identical to the Gβγ-binding region of PLEKHG2 that we reported previously (9.Ueda H. Nagae R. Kozawa M. Morishita R. Kimura S. Nagase T. Ohara O. Yoshida S. Asano T. Heterotrimeric G protein βγ subunits stimulate FLJ00018, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 and Cdc42.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1946-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, our present findings suggested that PLEKHG2, Gβγ, and FHL1A may form a ternary complex. As can be seen in Fig. 5, A and B, the amount of FHL1A and Gβγ interacting with PLEKHG2 did not decrease in the cells transfected with PLEKHG2, FHL1, and Gβγ. On the other hand, FHL1 interacted with Gβγ (see Fig. 5C). We could not analyze the binding region of FHL1 that interacted with Gβγ in detail; thus, further analysis will be needed to unravel the binding mechanisms. In contrast, the β-actin-binding region exists within aa 150–283 of PLEKHG2. The interaction of β-actin and PLEKHG2 has been shown to inhibit PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription (12.Sato K. Handa H. Kimura M. Okano Y. Nagaoka H. Nagase T. Sugiyama T. Kitade Y. Ueda H. Identification of a Rho family specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, FLJ00018, as a novel actin-binding protein.Cell. Signal. 2013; 25: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, aa 58–158 of PLEKHG2 may play an important role in the activity of PLEKHG2. Recently, we and other researchers suggested that the C terminus of PLEKHG2 might interact with the N terminus of PLEKHG2, and this interaction could impose a constraint on the normal DH domain function by masking the access of the Rho GTPase (9.Ueda H. Nagae R. Kozawa M. Morishita R. Kimura S. Nagase T. Ohara O. Yoshida S. Asano T. Heterotrimeric G protein βγ subunits stimulate FLJ00018, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 and Cdc42.J.

Cell Biol. 2013; 33: 4294-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that, when PLEKHG2 is activated, the interaction between the C and N termini is canceled, and the DH domain functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho protein. The binding of FHL1A and Gβγ to PLEKHG2 might help to prevent the intramolecular interaction of PLEKHG2. However, the details of such inhibition are unclear, and further analysis will be needed to determine the novel functional domain of PLEKHG2. PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription was activated by the expression of FHL1A. Moreover, the co-expression of FHL1A and Gβγ synergistically enhanced the PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to deplete FHL1 expression in HEK293 cells. In the FHL1-knock-out cells, the interaction between FHL1 and PLEKHG2 was not observed. Fig. 8 shows the results of our signaling experiments using FHL1-knock-out cells. FHL1 reduced the Gβγ-stimulated PLEKHG2-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription. Although it is still unclear whether FHL1 functions via a direct interaction with PLEKHG2 and Gβγ, we think these observations suggest that FHL1 is involved in the Gβγ-stimulated PLEKHG2 activation. The cellular functions of other FHL proteins (i.e. Act, FHL2, and FHL3) were recently reported. These proteins act as co-activators of androgen receptor (18.Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P.

Generic drugs are widely prescribed by physicians, although there is disagreement over the clinical comparability of generic drugs to brand-name drugs within the physician community. The objective of this survey was to assess physicians' perceptions of generic drugs and the generic drug approval process.A survey was administered to a national sample of primary care internists and specialists between August 2014 and January 2015. In total, 1,152 physicians comprising of internists with no reported specialty certification and those with specialty certification in hematology, infectious diseases, and endocrinology were surveyed. The survey assessed physicians' perceptions of the FDA's generic drug approval process, as well as their experiences prescribing six generic drugs approved between 2008 and 2012 using product-specific approval pathways and selected comparator drugs. Among 718 respondents (62% response rate), a majority were comfortable with the FDA's process in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs overall (91%) and with letting the FDA determine which tests were necessary to determine bioequivalence in a particular drug (92%). A minority (13-26%) still reported being uncomfortable prescribing generic drugs approved using product-specific pathways. Overall, few physicians heard reports of concerns about generic versions of the study drugs or their comparators, with no differences between the two groups. Physicians tended to hear about concerns about the safety or effectiveness of generic drugs from patients, pharmacists, and physician colleagues.Physicians hold largely positive views of the FDA's generic drug approval process even when some questioned the performance of certain generic drugs in comparison to brand-name drugs. Better education about the generic drug approval process and standards may alleviate concerns among the physician community and support the delivery of cost-effective health care."

The work has exciting implications for mental representation and shows how detailed neural-coding hypotheses can be tested with bulk population-activity measures. Language and art brim with analogies between physical spaces and conceptual spaces—we can “feel down,” “take someone through an argument,” or “rise in another’s estimation.” These spatial metaphors may have a basis in neuronal representations. Constantinescu et al., 2016Constantinescu A.O. O’Reilly J.X. Behrens T.E. Science. 2016; 352: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar reported evidence that the brain represents directions in abstract conceptual spaces using the same coding principles that represent directions in physical spaces. How physical space is represented in the brain has been investigated for over 40 years. Recording electrical activity in single hippocampal cells while a rat freely explored its environment revealed “place cells,” which fire reliably only when the animal is at a particular location (O’Keefe, 1976O’Keefe J. Exp. Neurol. 1976; 51: 78-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Even more striking are “grid cells,” found in nearby entorhinal cortex (ERH), which fire repeatedly as a rat traverses an environment. Overlaid on a map of the environment, the firing locations concentrate at the vertices of a grid of regular equilateral triangles (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Nature. 2005; 436: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar; see Figure 1A). Different grid cells tile a given environment with grids randomly offset from one another. The grids are also of different spatial scales, with a different distance between the vertices characterizing each cell. However, the grid angles are aligned between cells. For two different grid cells, thus, the two triangular grids may differ in size and may be shifted in the 2D plane but will not be rotated relative to one another. These discoveries won John O’Keefe, May-Britt Moser, and Edvard Moser the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology. “Conjunctive grid cells,” also found in ERH, are further specialized in that they fire only when the rat crosses a grid vertex while heading in a particular direction (Sargolini et al., 2006Sargolini F. Fyhn M. Hafting T. McNaughton B.L. Witter M.P. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Science. 2006; 312: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar; Figure 1B). The direction preferences of individual cells tend to coincide with one of the six main grid axes (i.e., the six directions formed by the edges of the hypothetical triangular tiles; Doeller et al., 2010Doeller C.F. Barry C. Burgess N. Nature. 2010; 463: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Activity across a population of grid cells is thought to precisely encode the animal’s position, direction, and speed as it navigates an environment (Moser et al., 2008Moser E.I. Kropff E. Moser M.-B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Doeller et al., 2010Doeller C.F. Barry C. Burgess N. Nature. 2010; 463: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar reasoned that the properties of conjunctive grid cells might render them detectable via bulk measures of population-mean neural activity, as can be obtained by fMRI. To see why this is the case, consider a subset of the population of conjunctive grid cells forming grids of a single spatial scale (because grids at different scales are aligned in orientation, any effect of heading direction on bulk population activity present at one scale will remain present when considering all scales). Suppose that the grids are randomly offset from one another so that the overall distribution of vertices in the 2D environment is uniform. If the grid cells were not directionally selective (or were selective for all directions with equal probability), then one would expect the population to fire a roughly equal number of spikes in total as the animal moved in any direction from a random starting point. We would thus expect no change in mean fMRI signal as a function of heading direction. However, conjunctive grid cells tend to be selective for one of the six main grid axes (Figure 1C depicts a population of six such cells, each selective for a different axis). Provided direction-selective tuning is relatively narrow, total neural activity across the population should be higher when the animal moves along an axis aligned with one of these axes (for which some cells will be strongly activated) than misaligned (for which no cells will be strongly activated; Figure 1D). Doeller et al., 2010Doeller C.F. Barry C. Burgess N. Nature. 2010; 463: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar therefore predicted that if human ERH contains spatial grid cells like those in rats, mean fMRI signal in ERH should display a 6-fold modulation when plotted as a function of heading direction. This prediction was confirmed in an elegant experiment in which brain activity was recorded while participants navigated in different directions within a virtual environment (Doeller et al., 2010Doeller C.F. Barry C. Burgess N. Nature. 2010; 463: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The 6-fold modulation was later found to be reduced in those at risk of Alzheimer’s, a disease typically accompanied by spatial disorientation (Kunz et al., 2015Kunz L. Schröder T.N. Lee H. Montag C. Lachmann B. Sariyska R. Reuter M. Stirnberg R. Stöcker T. Messing-Floeter P.C. et al.Science. 2015; 350: 430-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In an imaginative leap, Constantinescu et al., 2016Constantinescu A.O. O’Reilly J.X. Behrens T.E. Science. 2016; 352: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar adapted this logic and experimental design to ask whether the brain might use grid cells to encode not only physical, but conceptual, 2D spaces. For the experiment, they created a novel 2D space of bird shapes. The two dimensions were the leg and neck length of a simple silhouette drawing of a bird (Figure 2B). A point in this space corresponds to an image of a particular bird, and a direction corresponds to a ratio of neck-length change over leg-length change. If this 2D shape space were represented in the brain by direction-selective grid cells whose axes are aligned, then brain activity in regions containing such cells should display a 6-fold modulation as participants “move” in different directions within the shape space. Before fMRI scanning, participants were implicitly familiarised with the bird space without being shown a 2D depiction of it. Six locations within the space were associated with arbitrary Christmas-themed symbols (Figure 2A). When a participant arrived at one of these locations during training, the appropriate symbol was displayed. Training consisted of three tasks in which participants freely explored the space, tried to match the leg and neck lengths of a given target bird, and tried to navigate to the learned location of a given Christmas symbol. During training, participants navigated the bird shape space using a ballistic control method. The participant adjusted two vertical on-screen sliders to control the extent and direction of change in leg and neck length, then pressed a button, causing the image to morph into that determined by the chosen vector. This way of communicating the direction may appear unnatural. However, using a spatial representation, such as the motion of a mouse or joystick or an arrow in a 2D plane, would have biased participants in favor of a physical 2D representation of the shape space. The method appeared successful: when asked during debriefing, none of the participants reported having thought of the birds as forming a continuous 2D space. In the fMRI scanner, participants saw a random bird on each trial, which morphed in a random direction for 1 s (Figure 2B). Participants were instructed to imagine the bird continuing to morph along the same trajectory for a further 4 s. The imagination period was intended to encourage participants to actively encode the direction of travel within the shape space. At the end of each trial, participants reported whether the bird-shape trajectory passed through the learned locations of any of the six Christmas symbols. Most participants took part in multiple scanning sessions (2–4), which were separated by at least 1 week. For the main analysis, each participant’s fMRI dataset was split into two halves. To each half, the authors fit a general linear model (GLM), which tries to explain recorded activity in each voxel as a linear combination of various predictors. For the first data half, the two key predictors were a pair of sine and cosine functions of the trial’s morph direction, with a frequency of six cycles per 360°. Linear combinations of a sine and a cosine of the same frequency can explain a sine-shaped modulation of any phase at that frequency. The combination of coefficients estimated for the sine and cosine predictors specifies the phase at which most variance is explained by 6-fold modulation as a function of the direction in bird space. This phase defines the putative “grid angle” for a participant and brain region. If there truly were grid cells, the 6-fold modulation observed in one half of the data should replicate in the other half and exhibit the same grid angle. Grid-angle consistency in the second half of the data was assessed in two ways: in the first method, a whole-brain GLM was fitted to the second half, in which the key predictor was a single sinusoid aligned to the grid angle estimated for a particular brain region using the first half. Across participants, a predictor aligned to the grid angle estimated from ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC; a region previously associated with spatial tasks) explained significant variance in a cluster of nearby voxels and correlated with performance on the behavioral task across participants (Figure 2E). In the second method, consistency within a particular region of interest was assessed by splitting trials from the second data half into 12 bins according to their morph direction and fitting a new GLM, containing one predictor for each bin, to that region. On average across participants, in vmPFC and ERH, predictors for directions aligned with one of the grid axes estimated from the first data half received positive weights, while those for misaligned directions received negative weights, indicating that the grid angle replicated (Figure 2D). This held true whether the second half of the data was collected 30 min after the first half or more than a week later. The above analyses are similar to those performed by Doeller et al., 2010Doeller C.F. Barry C. Burgess N. Nature. 2010; 463: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar and Kunz et al., 2015Kunz L. Schröder T.N. Lee H. Montag C. Lachmann B. Sariyska R. Reuter M. Stirnberg R. Stöcker T. Messing-Floeter P.C. et al.Science. 2015; 350: 430-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar. However, those previous studies restricted analyses to anatomically predefined regions of interest. Constantinescu et al., 2016Constantinescu A.O. O’Reilly J.X. Behrens T.E. Science. 2016; 352: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar hypothesized that “conceptual grid cells” would be found in ERH and medial pre-frontal cortex, where human grid-cell activity has been directly recorded in spatial tasks, but wanted to allow some flexibility in the exact location. To accommodate this, they identified regions of interest by first conducting a whole-brain voxel-selection analysis to find clusters of voxels exhibiting 6-fold modulation across trials as a function of morph direction (Figure 2C) using pairs of sine and cosine predictors as described above. Importantly, this procedure was not circular because, in the voxel-selection analysis, separate pairs of sine and cosine predictors were used for each run of the fMRI data. If this analysis were applied to random data, it would select voxels exhibiting 6-fold modulation in each run of the data but would not favor voxels exhibiting this modulation with a consistent phase between runs. The demonstration of a consistent phase of the modulation (grid angle) cannot be explained by biased selection. This procedure identified seven clusters of voxels, overlapping those reported by Doeller et al., 2010Doeller C.F. Barry C. Burgess N. Nature. 2010; 463: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, including clusters in the two hypothesized regions (vmPFC and ERH), which were the focus of the subsequent consistency analyses. Within these two clusters selected for containing 6-fold modulation, the phase of that modulation was found to be consistent across sessions. Unsurprisingly, given that analyses focused on regions selected for 6-fold modulation, these regions showed no phase-consistent modulations at other frequencies (4-, 5-, 7-, or 8-fold). We might expect modulations at other frequencies to be present in other regions, since there are periodic fluctuations in some properties of the experiment (e.g., a 4-fold modulation in task difficulty, since extrapolating a trajectory is simpler when only the neck or only the legs are changing). Constantinescu et al., 2016Constantinescu A.O. O’Reilly J.X. Behrens T.E. Science. 2016; 352: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar reported a consistent 6-fold modulation in mean activity within vmPFC and ERH as a function of morphing direction in a 2D complex visual shape space. This finding is consistent with a population of neurons with narrow directional tuning and direction preferences that cluster around six equally spaced angles. A plausible interpretation is that the neurons in these regions code for the shape space in the same way that conjunctive grid cells in rat brains code for the animal’s environment. It is striking that single-cell tuning properties can produce characteristic signatures even in the bulk activity across millions of neurons. Collapsing many dimensions (the firing rates of millions of neurons) to just one (the mean fMRI signal within a region of interest) obliterates much information, but not all. Different hypotheses about the neural code are still discernible if they make distinct predictions about how bulk population activity is modulated by the stimulus. For example, Furmanski and Engel, 2000Furmanski C.S. Engel S.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 535-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar showed that mean activation in early visual areas is higher when a participant views a horizontal or vertical grating pattern than when they view diagonally oriented grating patterns. As in the case of the grid-cell fMRI studies, the experiment was motivated by a combination of preceding findings in electrophysiology. In the case of Furmanski and Engel, 2000Furmanski C.S. Engel S.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 535-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, it was known that individual cells in early visual areas tend to be narrowly selective for grating patterns of specific orientations and that cells with preferences for vertical and horizontal gratings outnumber those with other orientation preferences. The bulk population response to a cardinal axis is therefore likely to exceed that for any other orientation. This can be thought of as a 2-fold modulation in the fMRI signal when plotted as a function of orientation. Doeller et al., 2010Doeller C.F. Barry C. Burgess N. Nature. 2010; 463: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar introduced an fMRI signature of grid cells. The present paper by Constantinescu et al., 2016Constantinescu A.O. O’Reilly J.X. Behrens T.E. Science. 2016; 352: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar suggests that grid-like coding might be a much more general phenomenon relevant to many domains of perception and cognition. This is extremely exciting. These studies combined original designs with original data analyses. In order to enable multiple groups to explore the nature of the fMRI signature of grid cells with a range of different analyses, it would be great to have a dataset openly available. Some analyses that would be worth performing include:•Extra sum-of-squares F test: to test for n-fold symmetric tuning to direction with a single dataset, an extra sums-of-squares F test could be used to assess whether significant additional variance is explained by including a sine and cosine predictor pair at the appropriate frequency in the model. Inference could use trial-label permutation to avoid relying on distributional assumptions.•Split-data mapping: alternatively, the most likely grid angle could be estimated on one dataset for every voxel and a modulation model with the phase fixed at that angle fitted to an independent dataset. This procedure could be repeated with datasets reversed and the resulting amplitude estimates for the fixed-phase modulation predictor averaged to obtain a single map for each subject to be entered into a second-level random-effects analysis.•Split-data selection and test of a small number of regions: selection of a small number of n-fold modulated regions of interest and grid-angle estimation for those regions could be performed on one dataset, followed by a test of modulation at that grid angle in an independent dataset. Both datasets should have independent random condition sequences. (Note that this approach does not lend itself naturally to crossvalidation, because the regions of interest [ROIs] would differ between folds. Ideally, the ROIs from the first dataset would be preregistered before acquiring the second dataset in the same subjects.)•Small volume around a priori region: since the effects are subtle, whole-brain mapping with proper correction for multiple testing might be challenging. A remedy would be to focus initial analyses on ERH, using a predefined ROI and rigorous correction for multiple testing within a small volume including ERH or mPFC.•Analyses of the other 6-fold modulated regions: the mapping analyses of Constantinescu et al., 2016Constantinescu A.O. O’Reilly J.X. Behrens T.E. Science. 2016; 352: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar intriguingly highlighted five other regions beyond vmPFC and ERH exhibiting 6-fold modulation. Each region identified with mapping analyses in one dataset could be individually characterized with another dataset, with correction for multiple testing across regions.•Multiple modulation frequencies: analyses of phase-consistent modulation could be performed systematically at a range of frequencies (e.g., 4- to 8-fold).•Overall activation and behavioral performance: for each region exhibiting modulation, it would be good to see analyses of the overall activation of the region and the degree to which overall activation and modulation predict task performance across participants.•Multi-voxel pattern analyses: although the grid-aligned direction preferences of conjunctive grid cells predict a signature in population-average activity, averaging voxels may not be the most sensitive method of testing for grid-cell-like coding. Each voxel averages across many cells with different tunings. However, as in the case of orientation representation in primary visual cortex (Kamitani and Tong, 2005Kamitani Y. Tong F. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that all voxels pool across exactly the same distribution of tuning curves. We therefore expect each voxel to have a different population tuning function across directions. This could be exploited for greater sensitivity. For example, rather than averaging the fMRI data across voxels, voxelwise extra sum-of-squares F values (as described above) or phase-specific modulation amplitudes (with each voxel’s phase estimated from an independent dataset) could be averaged within each region of interest or within a searchlight centered at each location in turn. It would also be interesting to use linear decoders (e.g., to predict direction) or to analyze the pattern representational dissimilarity structure.•Phase-invariant crossnobis modulation index: an ideal multivariate index measuring the modulation at a given frequency in an ROI or searchlight should (1) allow different phases in different voxels, (2) benefit from optimal weighting of the evidence and noise cancellation across voxels, and (3) be unbiased (i.e., have expected value 0 under the null hypothesis of no modulation). Such an index can be computed as follows: estimate the sine and cosine coefficient patterns across the ROI for each of two independent datasets; perform multivariate noise normalization, applying the linear transform that whitens the GLM residuals to the coefficient patterns; compute the inner product between datasets of the whitened sine coefficient pattern; compute the inner product of the whitened cosine coefficient pattern; and sum these two inner products. This index is the sum of the crossvalidated Mahalanobis (crossnobis) distances for the sine and cosine modulations. The possibility of a unified computational principle in the brain for encoding physical and conceptual spaces, that can be studied non-invasively in humans, raises a host of tantalising research questions. For example:•How are grid cells dynamically constructed or co-opted to encode new concepts? For physical spaces, grid-like coding is immediately present when an animal is placed in a new environment (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Nature. 2005; 436: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). However, the status of a particular visual stimulus as belonging to a continuous two-dimensional stimulus space is not immediately apparent. It would be interesting to see a longitudinal version of Constantinescu et al., 2016Constantinescu A.O. O’Reilly J.X. Behrens T.E. Science. 2016; 352: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar’s study, in which participants are scanned repeatedly as they become familiar with a novel conceptual space.•What determines the receptive fields of “conceptual grid cells”? For example, the grid patterns of classical grid cells can be stretched or rescaled by moving the borders of a physical environment (Moser et al., 2008Moser E.I. Kropff E. Moser M.-B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Conceptual spaces often take the form of statistical tendencies, with no salient borders (e.g., the distribution of dogs one has encountered). In Constantinescu et al., 2016Constantinescu A.O. O’Reilly J.X. Behrens T.E. Science. 2016; 352: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar’s experiment, two of the borders to “bird space” are made salient via bars on the display indicating the maximum neck and leg lengths (see Figure 2B). Is grid-like activity affected by or dependent on such borders?•Can we use the bird’s-eye view afforded by fMRI to better understand the global layout of grid codes? fMRI has revealed multiple face-selective regions in humans (e.g., Kanwisher et al., 1997Kanwisher N. McDermott J. Chun M.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4302-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and monkeys (Tsao et al., 2003Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Knutsen T.A. Mandeville J.B. Tootell R.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) that had escaped electrode-recording studies, which lack continuous coverage. There is some evidence from electrophysiology that rat ERH may comprise multiple “modules,” each with a different, internally consistent grid orientation, although the organizational principles are poorly understood (Moser et al., 2008Moser E.I. Kropff E. Moser M.-B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). In order to investigate this, future studies could use unsmoothed fMRI data and map both the 6-fold modulation amplitude and the phase (grid angle) continuously in order to find all grid-cell regions and reveal whether the angle is consistent between and within regions, and whether it changes abruptly or smoothly along the cortical sheet. If different grid-cell “modules” exist within ERH, do they differ in their connectivity to external regions, or even in their functional connectivity across different tasks?•How are higher-dimensional spaces represented? Many perceptual and conceptual spaces consist of more than two dimensions (e.g., three-dimensional color space; high-dimensional “face space”). There is theoretical work on what form efficient codes for higher-dimensional spaces may take (e.g., Mathis et al., 2015Mathis A. Stemmler M.B. Herz A.V.M. eLife. 2015; 4: e05979Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar)—what, if any, signatures might we expect these to give rise to in measures of bulk population activity? Constantinescu et al., 2016Constantinescu A.O. O’Reilly J.X. Behrens T.E. Science. 2016; 352: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar’s study demonstrates the power of fMRI to reveal hypothesized neural codes throughout the human brain and suggests the exciting possibility that a single coding principle underlies the representation of arbitrary 2D spaces, whether physical or abstract.

https://openalex.org/W436254827,"We examine the impact of religious identity and village-level religious fragmentation on behavior in Tullock contests. We report on a series of two-player Tullock contest experiments conducted on a sample of 516 Hindu and Muslim participants in rural West Bengal, India. Our treatments are the identity of the two players and the degree of religious fragmentation in the village where subjects reside. Our main finding is that the effect of social identity is small and inconsistent across the two religious groups in our study. While we find small but statistically significant results in line with our hypotheses in the Hindu sample, we find no statistically significant effects in the Muslim sample. This is in contrast to evidence from Chakravarty et al. (2016), who report significant differences in cooperation levels in prisoners’ dilemma and stag hunt games, both in terms of village composition and identity. We attribute this to the fact that social identity may have a more powerful effect on cooperation than on conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2536879337,"Understanding the production and differentiation of megakaryocytes from progenitors is crucial for realizing the biology and functions of these vital cells. Previous gene ablation studies demonstrated the essential role of the transcriptional repressor Gfi1b (growth factor independence 1b) in the generation of both erythroid and megakaryocytic cells. However, our recent work has demonstrated the down-regulation of this factor during megakaryocytic differentiation. In this study we identify two new gene targets of Gfi1b, the cytoskeletal proteins Kindlin3 and Talin1, and demonstrate the inverse expression and functions of these cytoskeletal targets relative to Gfi1b, during megakaryocytic differentiation. Both kindlin3 and talin1 promoters exhibit dose dependent Gfi1b and LSD1 (lysine specific demethylase 1; a Gfi1b cofactor) enrichment in megakaryocytes and repression in non-hematopoietic cells. Accordingly the expression of these genes is elevated in gfi1b mutant and LSD1 inhibited hematopoietic cells, while during megakaryocytic differentiation, declining Gfi1b levels fostered the reciprocal upregulation of these cytoskeletal factors. Concordantly, manipulation of Kindlin3 and Talin1 expression demonstrated positive correlation with megakaryocytic differentiation with over-expression stimulating, and inhibition diminishing, this process. Co-operativity between these factors and integrins in promoting differentiation was further underscored by physical interactions between them and integrinβ3/CD61 and by stimulation of differentiation by the Talin1 head domain, which is necessary and sufficient for integrin activation. Therefore this study demonstrates the significance of Gfi1b regulated Kindlin3-Talin1 expression in driving megakaryocytic differentiation and highlights the contribution of cytoskeletal agents in the developmental progression of these platelet progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2539105724,"In early 2015, the debate of blue-black and white-gold color perception from “the dress” became an overnight internet phenomenon. According to the vote from the online social network Twitter, more people observed white-gold colors than those who observed blue-black colors. Biological explanations have been proposed by neurologist and other scientists, most of which mainly focus on the bias of color perception from visual cortex assuming different illuminants as backgrounds. The goal of this study was to investigate the genetic reason that might be underlying this phenomenon. We carried out a preliminary survey study using four complex pedigrees and examined the inheritance mode influencing the ability to perceive the real colors, blue-black, from the photograph. We evaluated the likelihood of sporadic, major gene in Mendelian mode, major gene in non-Mendelian mode and environmental models. Complex segregation analyses indicated that the inheritance was probably due to a non-Mendelian major gene effect. Our study also indicated the importance of environmental or epigenetic factors in this color perception trait."
https://openalex.org/W2539132333,"Objectives We estimated war-related Iraqi mortality for the period 1980 through 1993. Method To test our hypothesis that deaths reported by siblings (even dating back several decades) would correspond with war events, we compared sibling mortality reports with the frequency of independent news reports about violent historic events. We used data from a survey of 4,287 adults in 2000 Iraqi households conducted in 2011. Interviewees reported on the status of their 24,759 siblings. Death rates were applied to population estimates, 1980 to 1993. News report data came from the ProQuest New York Times database. Results About half of sibling-reported deaths across the study period were attributed to direct war-related injuries. The Iran-Iraq war led to nearly 200,000 adult deaths, and the 1990–1991 First Gulf War generated another approximately 40,000 deaths. Deaths during peace intervals before and after each war were significantly lower. We found a relationship between total sibling-reported deaths and the tally of war events across the period, p = 0.02. Conclusions We report a novel method to verify the reliability of epidemiological (household survey) estimates of direct war-related injury mortality dating back several decades."
https://openalex.org/W2533634628,"The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with confirmed fatal hyperglycaemia, which could predispose potentially preventable deaths in individuals on glucose lowering drugs.A retrospective register-based case-control study conducted on a nationwide cohort with individuals who died due to hyperglycaemia as determined by forensic postmortem examination, in Sweden August 2006 to December 2012. Vitreous glucose was used to diagnose hyperglycaemia postmortem. The forensic findings stored in the National Forensic Medicine Database were linked to nationwide registers. Cases that died due to confirmed hyperglycemia with dispensed glucose lowering drugs were identified and living controls with dispensed glucose lowering drugs were randomly selected in the Swedish prescribed drug register and matched on age and sex. Information on comorbidities, dispensed pharmaceuticals, clinical data and socioeconomic factors were obtained for cases and controls. Adjusted multiple logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors associated with fatal hyperglycaemia.During the study period 322 individuals, mostly males (79%) with the mean age of 53.9 years (SD.± 14) died due to confirmed hyperglycaemia. Risk factors for fatal hyperglycaemia included; insulin treatment (OR = 4.40; 95%CI,1.96, 9.85), poor glycaemic control (OR = 2.00 95%CI,1.23, 3.27), inadequate refill-adherence before death (OR = 3.87; 95%CI,1.99, 7.53), microvascular disease (OR = 3.26; 95% CI, 1.84, 5.79), psychiatric illness (OR = 2.30; 95% CI,1.32, 4.01), substance abuse (OR = 8.85; 95%CI,2.34, 35.0) and/or living alone (OR = 2.25; 95%CI,1.21, 4.18).Our results demonstrate the importance of clinical attention to poor glycaemic control in subjects with psychosocial problems since it may indicate serious non-adherence, which consequently could lead to fatal hyperglycaemia."
