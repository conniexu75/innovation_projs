https://openalex.org/W3016570710,"Summary Impairment of protein phosphatases, including the family of serine/threonine phosphatases designated PP2A, is essential for the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer. The ability of PP2A to dephosphorylate hundreds of proteins is regulated by over 40 specificity-determining regulatory “B” subunits that compete for assembly and activation of heterogeneous PP2A heterotrimers. Here, we reveal how a small molecule, DT-061, specifically stabilizes the B56α-PP2A holoenzyme in a fully assembled, active state to dephosphorylate selective substrates, such as its well-known oncogenic target, c-Myc. Our 3.6 A structure identifies molecular interactions between DT-061 and all three PP2A subunits that prevent dissociation of the active enzyme and highlight inherent mechanisms of PP2A complex assembly. Thus, our findings provide fundamental insights into PP2A complex assembly and regulation, identify a unique interfacial stabilizing mode of action for therapeutic targeting, and aid in the development of phosphatase-based therapeutics tailored against disease specific phospho-protein targets."

Pharmacological targeting of FGFRs may therefore provide therapeutic benefit to selected cancer patients, and proof-of-concept has been established in early clinical trials of FGFR inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular structure and preclinical characterization of INCB054828 (pemigatinib), a novel, selective inhibitor of FGFR 1, 2, and 3, currently in phase 2 clinical trials. INCB054828 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were investigated using cell lines and tumor models, and the antitumor effect of oral INCB054828 was investigated using xenograft tumor models with genetic alterations in FGFR1, 2, or 3. Enzymatic assays with recombinant human FGFR kinases showed potent inhibition of FGFR1, 2, and 3 by INCB054828 (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0 nM, respectively) with weaker activity against FGFR4 (IC50 30 nM). INCB054828 selectively inhibited growth of tumor cell lines with activation of FGFR signaling compared with cell lines lacking FGFR aberrations. The preclinical pharmacokinetic profile suggests target inhibition is achievable by INCB054828 in vivo with low oral doses. INCB054828 suppressed the growth of xenografted tumor models with FGFR1, 2, or 3 alterations as monotherapy, and the combination of INCB054828 with cisplatin provided significant benefit over either single agent, with an acceptable tolerability. The preclinical data presented for INCB054828, together with preliminary clinical observations, support continued investigation in patients with FGFR alterations, such as fusions and activating mutations."

The ability to learn from experience and adapt flexibly to environmental changes is critical for survival.

In these tasks, the associations between two choices and their reward outcomes are initially learned over a series of trials and then reversed. For example, in a two-armed bandit reversal learning task, rewards are stochastically associated with two images. Choosing one image may lead to a reward more often (e.g., a circle, 70%) than choosing the other image (e.g., a square, 30%). After subjects have learned the initial association and consistently select the circle, the choice-outcome mapping is reversed at one trial, and the square becomes the more frequently rewarded option. One must switch from selecting the circle to selecting the square. The ability of animals to adapt their behavior after the reversal is used as a measure of behavioral flexibility. Many behavioral strategies and neural systems may be used to learn and update choice-reward mappings on these tasks, including working memory (Collins and Frank, 2012Collins A.G. Frank M.J.

In deterministic environments in which choices consistently lead to the same outcome, working memory can be effective because the outcome on the last trial dictates the best choice in the current trial. However, to learn efficiently when outcomes are stochastic, information must be integrated over many trials, beyond the limits of working memory. Model-free RL, including Rescorla-Wagner (RW) and temporal-difference RL, can integrate outcomes over long periods of time (Averbeck, 2017Averbeck B.B.

In contrast to model-free RL algorithms, animals may use Bayesian or state-inference strategies to infer reversals (Costa et al., 2015Costa V.D. Tran V.L. Turchi J. Averbeck B.B.

Bayesian models of reversal learning have knowledge of the structure of the task. They assume that one of the cues is initially more frequently rewarded and that there is a reversal in the choice-outcome mapping, after which the other cue is more frequently rewarded. The goal of the algorithm is to determine which cue is initially best and then to detect the reversal. Inferring the reversal is equivalent to latent state inference (Schuck et al., 2016Schuck N.W.

Bayesian strategies can efficiently detect reversals, because they model correctly the switches in choice-outcome mappings that happen across single trials (Wilson et al., 2010Wilson R.C. Nassar M.R.

Model-free RL algorithms implicitly assume that values change incrementally across trials, an incorrect assumption for reversal learning, in which values change abruptly. Increasing evidence shows that with enough experience, animals can use Bayesian or state-inference strategies to solve reversal learning tasks (Costa et al., 2015Costa V.D. Tran V.L. Turchi J.

Furthermore, there is evidence that prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions may be important for representing, or inferring, current state in other tasks (Durstewitz et al., 2010Durstewitz D. Vittoz N.M.

Here, we examined neural population signals related to state switching processes in dorsal-lateral PFC while monkeys performed a reversal learning task (Rothenhoefer et al., 2017Rothenhoefer K.M. Costa V.D. Bartolo R. Vicario-Feliciano R. Murray E.A. Averbeck B.B. Effects of ventral striatum lesions on stimulus-based versus action-based reinforcement learning.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 6902-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Neural population activity was recorded with eight Utah arrays implanted bilaterally (four in each hemisphere) in area 46 (Mitz et al., 2017Mitz A.R. Bartolo R. Saunders R.C. Browning P.G. Talbot T. Averbeck B.B. High channel count single-unit recordings from nonhuman primate frontal cortex.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2017; 289: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We found that monkeys adopted a Bayesian strategy to infer reversals. Furthermore, there was a clear signal in PFC indicating the trial in which the animals switched their choice preference following a reversal. High channel-count recording data (up to 1,000 simultaneously recorded neurons) allowed us to infer behavioral state switches in single trials. We trained two macaques to perform a two-armed bandit reversal learning task (Figure 1A; see STAR Methods). The task is organized in blocks of 80 trials. On each trial, monkeys fixated centrally for a variable time (400–800 ms), then two target images were simultaneously presented to the left and right of the fixation point, prompting them to choose one. Animals had to make a saccade toward the chosen target and hold for 500 ms. Reward was delivered stochastically. One of the two options had a higher reward probability than the other (p = 0.7 versus p = 0.3), and the monkeys had to discover which option was the best by trial and error. The reward probability mapping in each block was defined in one of two possible ways. In What blocks, reward probabilities were associated to the images, independent of their location (left or right from the fixation point). Conversely, in Where blocks, either the left or right target had the high reward probability, independent of the specific image presented at that location. Block type was randomized and not cued; thus, monkeys had to discover if image or location determined reward delivery. Within each block, the reward mappings were switched across options at a random trial within a switch window (trials 30–50) dividing the block into two phases: (1) the initial acquisition phase, in which the animals learned the block type and the best option, and (2) the reversal phase, in which they had to switch their choice preference to maximize reward. The monkeys completed between 1,840 and 1,920 valid trials per session. We show results from eight sessions, four per animal. We first examined the behavioral data. Given the stochasticity of the reward delivery, estimates of the reversal trial may not match the programmed switch trial. To account for this, we fit two Bayesian change-point models. First, we fit a Bayesian ideal observer (IO) model to estimate the posterior probability distribution across trials that the reward mapping had reversed, P(reversal|model = IO). The P(reversal|model = IO) distribution was on average in agreement with the programmed reversal, peaking at the center of the switch window (Figure 1C). Second, we fit a Bayesian model of the monkey choice behavior (BHV) to estimate the posterior probability distribution across trials that the animal switched its choice preference, P(reversal|M = BHV), independently of when the actual reversal in the choice-outcome mapping occurred (Figure 1C). From the IO and BHV model distributions, we computed point estimates of the trial at which either the choice-outcome mapping or the animal’s choice preference reversed, by calculating the expected value of the corresponding P(reversal|M). When we aligned the BHV reversal distributions to the estimated trial on which the behavioral reversal occurred, and then averaged, it could be seen that the BHV reversal distributions were narrow, focused around the reversal point (Figure 1D). This suggests that reversals were well defined. The broader distributions seen in Figure 1C follow from averaging narrow distributions that peak on different trials. Next, we aligned the choice data using the IO reversal point (Figure 1F). At the beginning of the block, monkeys quickly inferred which option was optimal and chose it more often. After the reward probability mapping switched, they reversed their choice behavior. With this alignment, the animals appeared to slowly change preference to the best post-reversal option. However, if we align the choices to the BHV reversal point, it is evident that monkeys changed their choice preferences abruptly (Figure 1G). The apparent slow change when aligned to the IO reversal point (Figure 1F) is due to averaging rapid changes that occur on different trials relative to the IO reversal. We compared the reversal point estimates between the BHV and IO models. Typically, the animals reversed their choices a few trials after the IO model (Figure 1E), but in several blocks the animals reversed before the IO model (i.e., before the evidence would suggest that the reward mapping had switched). This is inconsistent with a gradual updating process, as it can be explained only if the animals have an expectation that a switch in the reward mapping will occur at some point. We also fit RW RL models to the choice behavior and overlaid the average choice probabilities from the model on the choice data. Although RW models approximated the data well for the acquisition phase (Figures 1F–1H) and most of the reversal phase for the IO aligned data (Figure 1F), the RL model reversed preference much more slowly than the animals. This could be seen when the data were aligned around the BHV reversal trial (Figure 1G). The RW rule may be too restrictive, because learning might be enhanced around the reversal. To account for this, we fitted a Pearce-Hall (PH) model, which allows the learning rate to vary when RPEs are larger. The PH model predictions were similar to those of the RW model (Figure 1H). Both models failed to fit properly the observed behavior in the first few trials after the behavioral reversal point. Critically, the association parameter of the PH model showed only a small increase around the reversal point (Figure S1), which likely follows from the fact that animals reversed quickly after the contingencies switched (Figure 1E). We compared the fit of the RW, PH, and Bayesian models around the reversal point (trials 20–60). The Bayesian model predicted reversals better than the RW (mean log BF = 97, SEM = 32, t7 = 3.25, p = 0.014) and PH (log BF = 123, SEM = 31.4, t7 = 4.20, p = 0.004) models across sessions. Thus, the Bayesian model accounted better for choice behavior after a reversal in the reward mapping. These findings are consistent with the animals using Bayesian state inference to reverse their choice behavior. We hypothesized that PFC neurons would display activity associated with the process of switching preferences after reversals in our task. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the extracellular activity of neural populations in the dlPFC (size range 573–1,023 neurons, median 706.5) using eight multielectrode arrays (Figure 1B) while the monkeys performed the task. The recorded neurons were evenly distributed across left and right hemispheres (mean ± SD 47.21% ± 5.32% and 52.79% ± 5.31%). The task robustly engaged a large fraction of the recorded neurons. We observed a broad diversity of activity profiles, including differential responses to image and location chosen (e.g., Figures 2A and 2B ). Within this diversity, many units exhibited responses associated with the chosen option in both What and Where blocks. We ran ANOVAs on spike counts from a sliding window that was moved across trial execution (300 ms width, 20 ms step). The results revealed that image and location chosen drove the activity of a large fraction of neurons (Figure 2C; ∼62% and ∼50%, respectively). Toward the end of the trial, there was a strong neural response associated with the outcome. We also examined associations between neural responses and Bayesian estimates related to learning in the task. About 20% of the neurons had activity associated with the posterior probability of a reversal in the choice behavior: P(reversal|M = BHV). An interesting feature is that activity was related to P(reversal|M = BHV) even before cue onset, suggesting that the neurons represent the choice to switch preferences throughout the trial, in agreement with previous observations (Asaad et al., 2000Asaad W.F. Rainer G. Miller E.K. Task-specific neural activity in the primate prefrontal cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, Averbeck and Lee, 2007Averbeck B.B.

Itoyama Y. Tanji J. Activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex reflects multiple steps of future events in action plans.Neuron. 2006; 50: 631-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We focus on this reversal-related activity in detail below. From the BHV model, we also estimated if the animals were choosing consistently between images or locations, that is, the posterior probability of block type being What (P[blocktype = what]) or Where (P[blocktype = where]). Similar to the activity related to P(reversal), the association between neural activity and Bayesian estimates for block type existed from the beginning of the trial, and there is only a small increase in the fraction of neurons with a significant effect of this factor after cue onset (Figure 2C), revealing block type inference processes in the PFC. We did not observe differences in behavior around reversal (Figures 1E–1H), or in reversal decoding, between block types (Figure 3D legend). Therefore, further reversal analyses included all blocks together independently of block type. Next, we examined the reversal-related neural activity in more detail. We fit a linear model (Figure 2C) to the spike count data using all regressors except the Bayesian estimate of the posterior p(reversal|M = BHV) (see STAR Methods). We then extracted the residuals from this model and computed the sum of squared residuals (SSresid) across all recorded neurons for each trial and time window within a trial. For the time window from 0 to 300 ms after cue onset, the SSresid followed closely the posterior over reversals, P(reversal|M = BHV), when examined trial by trial (Figure 3A). Both P(reversal|M = BHV) and SSresid peaked at the trial at which the choice preference reversal occurred. We also examined the RPE from the RW model, as they would be large around the time of the reversal. RPE size peaked before the behavioral reversal trial and were overall biased to the trials before reversal (Figure 3B). This is consistent with the animals’ integrating the RPE to drive their switch but suggests that the neural activity represents the switch itself, not the RPE. Supporting this point, SSresid has a significantly higher correlation with P(reversal|M = BHV) than with the RPE, when examined session by session (t7 = 9.83, p < 0.001; see Figures 3A and 3B, insets). Next, we used the residual neural activity to predict the reversal trial and compared this with the actual behavioral reversal trial. We first predicted the reversal trial in each block by finding the trial (within a window ±10 trials around reversal) with the highest SSresid. We found that the trial with the largest SSresid was useful to decode the reversal (Figure S2). However, SSresid is an unsigned quantity, so this approach is blind to activity patterns (i.e., both increases and decreases in single-cell activity that may signal reversals) in the neural population. To take the population response pattern into account, we used the adjusted neural activity (e.g., the residual activity without squaring) to classify trials into reversal and non-reversal using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In each block, LDA takes the adjusted activity of all the recorded neural population (predictors) and generates a posterior probability distribution that the reversal occurred on each trial, P(reversal|neural response). We first examined the mean P(reversal|neural response) and found that the neural posterior probability peaked at the behavioral reversal trial (Figure 3C) and approximated P(reversal|M = BHV) closely. Next, we decoded the single trial in each block on which the reversal occurred, using the neural activity. The decoded reversal trial in each block was the trial with the maximum posterior probability (MAP). By computing this MAP estimate for each block from P(reversal|neural response), we were able to decode accurately the trial at which the choice preference reversed for most of the blocks (Figure 3D). We repeated this analysis on raw spike counts rather than the adjusted activity (Figure S3) and found a similar P(reversal|neural response), but the distribution of decoded reversal trials is less accurate than that obtained using the residual activity. This mismatch indicates that activity not related to reversal introduces noise in the decoding. We examined P(reversal|M = BHV) separately for blocks that differed in the neural decoding error (i.e., the difference between the behavioral reversal and the decoded reversal) to assess whether P(reversal|M = BHV) was related to decoding accuracy. When we plotted P(reversal|M = BHV) as a function of the size of the decoding error (Figure 4A), we found that larger decoding errors were associated with wider distributions of P(reversal|M = BHV). Thus, when the animal failed to reverse abruptly, as evidenced by a broad distribution over trials, the decoding error was large (Figure 4B). To characterize uncertainty in the behavioral posterior, we calculated the SD of the P(reversal|M = BHV) distribution. The SD was correlated with the decoding error (Pearson R = 0.224 ± 0.07, mean ± SEM across sessions). Because noisy posterior distributions tended to have more than one peak, we also calculated the entropy of the P(reversal|M = BHV) distribution to measure of the concentration of the distribution. Entropy was also correlated with decoding error (Figure 4C). In fact, t tests revealed that the Pearson correlation coefficient was significantly different from zero (t7 = 3.76, p = 0.007), as well as the slope of the regression (t7 = 3.82, p = 0.006). Plus, an ANOVA that used block-by-block decoding error and entropy revealed a significant main effect of decoding error size on the entropy (F1,188 = 22.81, p < 0.0001). Up to this point we have focused on a time window from 0 to 300 ms after cue onset. To examine the time course of this signal, we decoded the reversal using spike counts from a sliding window (300 ms width, 50 ms steps; Figure 5A). We were able to accurately decode the reversal trial from ∼100 ms after cue onset until ∼400 ms after cue onset, then the peak of the decoded reversal distribution shifted to −1 (i.e., the trial previous to the behavioral switch) (Figure 5B). The timing of this shift matched the average time at which the reward was stochastically delivered (or not), suggesting that the neural signal related to reversals develops after the animal knows the outcome on the trial before it reverses its choices. To examine this, we decoded the reversal trial using neural data aligned to the expected time of the trial outcome. Results of decoding using data from a sliding window showed that after the outcome was revealed, the decoded reversals predict that the choice reversal will happen in the next trial (Figures 5C and 5D). In fact, for a window from 0 to 300 ms after trial outcome, the P(reversal|neural response) distribution is shifted to the left, peaking one trial before the behavioral reversal (Figure 5E). Thus, the intention to switch is represented as soon as the monkeys learn the outcome and continues into the switch trial. Next, we asked if the observed signal could be interpreted as a general state uncertainty signal, rather than a signal for the reversal of choice behavior. On the first few trials"

Although the preventive effect of Lactobacillus supplementation against allergies has been reported, the precise Lactobacillus species beneficial for effective prevention of asthma remain unidentified and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of oral administration of six Lactobacillus species and the mechanism underlying asthma prevention via gut microbiome modulation. We investigated the effects of oral administration of L. rhamnosus, L. fermentum, L. casei, L. gasseri, L. salivarius, and L. reuteri (five strains of each species) on asthma and gut microbiome of house dust mite (HDM)-treated murine models of asthma. Of these, L. reuteri administration was the most effective: it alleviated airway inflammation, decreased total IgE and HDM-IgG1, and reduced Th2-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, modulation of specific microbial genera by L. reuteri was more effective in asthma prevention than the modulation of the overall microbiota composition. Lactobacillus and Enterococcus were enriched after L. reuteri supplementation and were closely associated with total IgE and IL-13 production. Furthermore, L. reuteri specifically altered the gut microbial function toward butyrate generation. Thus, L. reuteri may reduce the risk of asthma development by modulating specific gut microbiota to improve the lung immune environment. Our study suggests a novel option for gut microbiome manipulation via L. reuteri supplementation for suppression of asthma and other allergic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3017252764,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a leap forward in resolving cellular diversity and developmental trajectories but fails to comprehensively delineate the spatial organization and precise cellular makeup of individual embryos. Here, we reconstruct from scRNA-seq and light sheet imaging data a canonical digital embryo that captures the genome-wide gene expression trajectory of every single cell at every cell division in the 18 lineages up to gastrulation in the ascidian Phallusia mammillata. By using high-coverage scRNA-seq, we devise a computational framework that stratifies single cells of individual embryos into cell types without prior knowledge. Unbiased transcriptome data analysis mapped each cell’s physical position and lineage history, yielding the complete history of gene expression at the genome-wide level for every single cell in a developing embryo. A comparison of individual embryos reveals both extensive reproducibility between symmetric embryo sides and a large inter-embryonic variability due to small differences in embryogenesis timing."

Methods Data were collected from 1687 AGYW aged 10–14 years (n = 606) and 15–22 years (n = 1081), randomly selected from a general population census in Korogocho and Viwandani in 2017, as part of an impact evaluation of the “DREAMS” Partnership. For 10–14 year-olds, we measured violence experienced either in the past 6 months or ever using a different set of questions from those used for 15–22 year-olds. Among 15–22 year-olds we measured prevalence of violence, experienced in the past 12 months, using World Health Organization (WHO) definitions for violence typologies. Predictors of violence were identified using multivariable logit models. Results Among 606 girls aged 10–14 years, about 54% and 7% ever experienced psychological and sexual violence, respectively. About 33%, 16% and 5% experienced psychological, physical and sexual violence in the past 6 months. The 10–14 year old girls who engaged in chores or activities for payment in the past 6 months, or whose family did not have enough food due to lack of money were at a greater risk for violence. Invitation to DREAMS and being a non-Christian were protective. Among 1081 AGYW aged 15–22 years, psychological violence was the most prevalent in the past year (33.1%), followed by physical violence (22.9%), and sexual violence (15.8%). About 7% experienced all three types of violence. Severe physical violence was more prevalent (13.8%) than moderate physical violence (9.2%). Among AGYW aged 15–22 years, being previously married/lived with partner, engaging in employment last month, food insecure were all risk factors for psychological violence. For physical violence, living in Viwandani and being a Muslim were protective; while being previously married or lived with a partner, or sleeping hungry at night during the past 4 weeks were risk factors. The odds of sexual violence were lower among AGYW aged 18–22 years and among Muslims. Engaging in sex and food insecurity increased chances for sexual violence. Conclusions Prevalence of recent violence among AGYW is high in this population. This calls for increased effort geared towards addressing drivers of violence as an early entry point of HIV prevention effort in this vulnerable group."
https://openalex.org/W3016308053,"Many subjects with neuropathologically-confirmed dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are never diagnosed during life, instead being categorized as Alzheimer’s disease dementia (ADD) or unspecified dementia. Unrecognized DLB therefore is a critical impediment to clinical studies and treatment trials of both ADD and DLB. There are studies that suggest that olfactory function tests may be able to distinguish DLB from ADD, but few of these had neuropathological confirmation of diagnosis. We compared University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) results in 257 subjects that went on to autopsy and neuropathological examination. Consensus clinicopathological diagnostic criteria were used to define ADD and DLB, as well as Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PDD), with (PDD+AD) or without (PDD-AD) concurrent AD; a group with ADD and Lewy body disease (LBD) not meeting criteria for DLB (ADLB) and a clinically normal control group were also included. The subjects with DLB, PDD+AD and PDD-AD all had lower (one-way ANOVA p < 0.0001, pairwise Bonferroni p < 0.05) first and mean UPSIT scores than the ADD, ADLB or control groups. For DLB subjects with first and mean UPSIT scores less than 20 and 17, respectively, Firth logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, gender and mean MMSE score, conferred statistically significant odds ratios of 17.5 and 18.0 for the diagnosis, vs ADD. For other group comparisons (PDD+AD and PDD-AD vs ADD) and UPSIT cutoffs of 17, the same analyses resulted in odds ratios ranging from 16.3 to 31.6 (p < 0.0001). To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date comparing olfactory function in subjects with neuropathologically-confirmed LBD and ADD. Olfactory function testing may be a convenient and inexpensive strategy for enriching dementia studies or clinical trials with DLB subjects, or conversely, reducing the inclusion of DLB subjects in ADD studies or trials."
https://openalex.org/W3016468355,"Myocardial fibrosis is often associated with cardiac hypertrophy; indeed, fibrosis is one of the most critical factors affecting prognosis. We aimed to identify the molecules involved in promoting fibrosis under hypertrophic stimuli. We previously established a rat model of cardiac hypertrophy by pulmonary artery banding, in which approximately half of the animals developed fibrosis in the right ventricle. Here, we first comprehensively analyzed mRNA expression in the right ventricle with or without fibrosis in pulmonary artery banding model rats by DNA microarray analysis (GSE141650 at NCBI GEO). The expression levels of 19 genes were up-regulated more than 1.5-fold in fibrotic hearts compared with non-fibrotic hearts. Among them, fibrosis growth factor (FGF) 23 showed one of the biggest increases in expression. Real-time PCR analysis also revealed that, among the FGF receptor (FGFR) family, FGFR1 was highly expressed in fibrotic hearts. We then found that FGF23 was expressed predominantly in cardiomyocytes, while FGFR1 was predominantly expressed in fibroblasts in the rat ventricle. Next, we added FGF23 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (10-50 ng/mL of each) to isolated fibroblasts from normal adult rat ventricles and cultured them for three days. While FGF23 itself did not directly affect the expression levels of any fibrosis-related mRNAs, FGF23 enhanced the effect of TGF-β1 on increasing the expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) mRNA. This increase in xx-SMA mRNA levels due to the combination of TGF-β1 and FGF23 was attenuated by the inhibition of FGFR1 or the knockdown of FGFR1 in fibroblasts. Thus, FGF23 synergistically promoted the activation of fibroblasts with TGF-β1, transforming fibroblasts into myofibroblasts via FGFR1. Thus, we identified FGF23 as a paracrine factor secreted from cardiomyocytes to promote cardiac fibrosis under conditions in which TGF-β1 is activated. FGF23 could be a possible target to prevent fibrosis following myocardial hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W3016508921,"The ectonucleotidase CD39 on human regulatory T-cells (Treg) is an important immune regulator which is dysregulated in autoimmune diseases and cancer immunosuppression. We here define that CD39 expression on Treg is independent of the Treg-specific transcription factors FOXP3 and HELIOS and promoted by canonical TGF-b- and mTOR-signaling. Furthermore, the TGF-b mediated upregulation of CD39 is counteracted by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven autophagy. In line, CD39+ peripheral blood Treg constitute a distinct lineage with low autophagic flux and absent ROS production. Patients with rare genetic defects in autophagy show supraphysiological levels of CD39+ Treg, validating our observations in vivo. These biological processes rely on a distinct transcriptional program with CD39+ Treg expressing low levels of two genes with putative involvement in autophagy, NEFL and PLAC8. Furthermore, the TGF-b downstream transcription factor SOX4 is selectively upregulated in CD39+ Treg. Overexpression of SOX4 in Treg strongly increases CD39 expression, while Crispr/Cas9-mediated knockout of SOX4 in Treg has the opposing effect. Thus, we identify a crucial role of SOX4 in immune regulation and provide new insights involving the interplay of tolerogenic cues and autophagy in Treg."
https://openalex.org/W3016649766,"An assessment of the production, distribution and fate of highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) biomarkers produced by sea ice and pelagic diatoms is necessary to interpret their detection and proportions in the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas. HBIs measured in surface sediments collected from 2012 to 2017 were used to determine the distribution and seasonality of the biomarkers relative to sea ice patterns. A northward gradient of increasing ice algae deposition was observed with localized occurrences of elevated IP25 (sympagic HBI) concentrations from 68-70°N and consistently strong sympagic signatures from 71-72.5°N. A declining sympagic signature was observed from 2012 to 2017 in the northeast Chukchi Sea, coincident with declining sea ice concentrations. HBI fluxes were investigated on the northeast Chukchi shelf with a moored sediment trap deployed from August 2015 to July 2016. Fluxes of sea ice exclusive diatoms (Nitzschia frigida and Melosira arctica) and HBI-producing taxa (Pleurosigma, Haslea and Rhizosolenia spp.) were measured to confirm HBI sources and ice associations. IP25 was detected year-round, increasing in March 2016 (10 ng m-2 d-1) and reaching a maximum in July 2016 (1331 ng m-2 d-1). Snowmelt triggered the release of sea ice algae into the water column in May 2016, while under-ice pelagic production contributed to the diatom export in June and July 2016. Sea ice diatom fluxes were strongly correlated with the IP25 flux, however associations between pelagic diatoms and HBI fluxes were inconclusive. Bioturbation likely facilitates sustained burial of sympagic organic matter on the shelf despite the occurrence of pelagic diatom blooms. These results suggest that sympagic diatoms may sustain the food web through winter on the northeast Chukchi shelf. The reduced relative proportions of sympagic HBIs in the northern Bering Sea are likely driven by sea ice persistence in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3016826479,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with a poor prognosis resulting from tumor resistance to anticancer therapy and a high recurrence rate. Compelling evidence suggests that this is driven by subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) with tumor-initiating potential. ABC subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5) has been identified as a molecular marker for distinct subsets of chemoresistant tumor-initiating cell populations in diverse human malignancies. In the current study, we examined the potential role of ABCB5 in growth and chemoresistance of GBM. We found that ABCB5 is expressed in primary GBM tumors, in which its expression was significantly correlated with the CSC marker protein CD133 and with overall poor survival. Moreover, ABCB5 was also expressed by CD133-positive CSCs in the established human U-87 MG, LN-18, and LN-229 GBM cell lines. Antibody- or shRNA-mediated functional ABCB5 blockade inhibited proliferation and survival of GBM cells and sensitized them to temozolomide (TMZ)-induced apoptosis in vitro. Likewise, in in vivo human GBM xenograft experiments with immunodeficient mice, mAb treatment inhibited growth of mutant TP53, WT PTEN LN-229 tumors, and sensitized LN-229 tumors to TMZ therapy. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that ABCB5 blockade inhibits TMZ-induced G2/M arrest and augments TMZ-mediated cell death. Our results identify ABCB5 as a GBM chemoresistance marker and point to the potential utility of targeting ABCB5 to improve current GBM therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3016865608,"Association of bacteria with fungi is a major area of research in infection biology, however, very few strains of bacteria have been reported that can invade and reside within fungal hyphae. Here, we report the characterization of an endofungal bacterium Serratia marcescens D1 from Mucor irregularis SS7 hyphae. Upon re-inoculation, colonization of the endobacterium S. marcescens D1 in the hyphae of Mucor irregularis SS7 was demonstrated using stereo microscopy. However, S. marcescens D1 failed to invade into the hyphae of the tested Ascomycetes (except Fusarium oxysporum) and Basidiomycetes. Remarkably, Serratia marcescens D1 could invade and spread over the culture of F. oxysporum that resulted in mycelial death. Prodigiosin, the red pigment produced by the Serratia marcescens D1, helps the bacterium to invade fungal hyphae as revealed by the increasing permeability in fungal cell membrane. On the other hand, genes encoding the type VI secretion system (T6SS) assembly protein TssJ and an outer membrane associated murein lipoprotein also showed significant up-regulation during the interaction process, suggesting the involvement of T6SS in the invasion process."
https://openalex.org/W3016872605,"Mutations in the genes encoding the highly conserved Ca2+-sensing protein calmodulin (CaM) cause severe cardiac arrhythmias, including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death. Most of the identified arrhythmogenic mutations reside in the C-terminal domain of CaM and mostly affect Ca2+-coordinating residues. One exception is the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia–causing N53I substitution, which resides in the N-terminal domain (N-domain). It does not affect Ca2+ coordination and has only a minor impact on binding affinity toward Ca2+ and on other biophysical properties. Nevertheless, the N53I substitution dramatically affects CaM's ability to reduce the open probability of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) while having no effect on the regulation of the plasmalemmal voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, Cav1.2. To gain more insight into the molecular disease mechanism of this mutant, we used NMR to investigate the structures and dynamics of both apo- and Ca2+-bound CaM-N53I in solution. We also solved the crystal structures of WT and N53I CaM in complex with the primary calmodulin-binding domain (CaMBD2) from RyR2 at 1.84–2.13 Å resolutions. We found that all structures of the arrhythmogenic CaM-N53I variant are highly similar to those of WT CaM. However, we noted that the N53I substitution exposes an additional hydrophobic surface and that the intramolecular dynamics of the protein are significantly altered such that they destabilize the CaM N-domain. We conclude that the N53I-induced changes alter the interaction of the CaM N-domain with RyR2 and thereby likely cause the arrhythmogenic phenotype of this mutation.

In its mature processed form, CaM consists of 148 amino acid residues and is composed of two globular domains (N- and C-domain) connected by a flexible linker region (2Friedberg F. Rhoads A.R.

Each domain contains two EF-hand motifs that can bind one Ca2+ each, and the Ca2+ affinity is higher for the C-domain than the N-domain, giving CaM a wide Ca2+-sensing range. This wide range is used to conduct the Ca2+ signal in a variety of pathways because Ca2+-binding induces large conformational changes in CaM that alter its affinity for other protein targets (3Tidow H.

However, the mechanistic details that explain how CaM mutations lead to cardiac arrhythmia are not always understood. It is puzzling that one mutated allele can cause a dominant phenotype in the presence of five healthy alleles.

Although the effect of CaM-N53I in a cellular setting is evident, only small differences have been observed when looking at CaM-N53I biophysically. The Ca2+ affinity of both CaM-N53I domains, along with the Ca2+ affinity in the presence of a peptide representing the CaM-binding domain of RyR2 (CaMBD2), shows only small differences compared with CaM-WT (27Vassilakopoulou V.

Based on the cellular effects described above, it seems likely that the N53I mutation interferes with the interaction between CaM and RyR2. However, a recent high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the CaM-WT in complex with full-length RyR2 does not support this hypothesis because amino acid Asn53 seems not to interact with RyR2 under any of the investigated conditions (33Gong D. Chi X. Wei J. Zhou G. Huang G. Zhang L. Wang R. Lei J. Chen S.R.W. Yan N. Modulation of cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 by calmodulin.Nature. 2019; 572 (31278385): 347-35110.1038/s41586-019-1377-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To investigate the structural effect of the N53I mutation, we determined the solution structures and dynamics of CaM-N53I both in the apo- and Ca2+-loaded state by NMR, along with solving the crystal structures of both Ca2+/CaM-WT and -N53I in complex with CaMBD2 of RyR2. The affinity of CaM-N53I for RyR2–CaMBD2 was also determined. The overall goal of this work is to find the differences that can explain the arrhythmogenic nature of CaM-N53I. Throughout this paper, the CaM numbering is for mature CaM, meaning that the initial methionine is excluded. Both apoCaM and Ca2+/CaM possess eight α-helices, which will be named A–H, of which A–D are in the N-domain, whereas E–H are in the C-domain. Structures of other CaM variants have already been solved in which it has been shown that a mutation can give rise to a structural change (31Wang K. Holt C. Lu J. Brohus M. Larsen K.T. Overgaard M.T. Wimmer R. van Petegem F. Arrhythmia mutations in calmodulin cause conformational changes that affect interactions with the cardiac voltage-gated calcium channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We therefore started out by solving the structures of both apoCaM-N53I and Ca2+/CaM-N53I by NMR to investigate for structural differences compared with CaM-WT. The two CaM domains are connected by a flexible linker that causes them to sample a lot of different spatial conformations, making a simultaneous alignment of both domains in an ensemble impossible. Therefore, an ensemble of each domain of apoCaM-N53I was compared with its corresponding domain from apoCaM-WT (PDB code 1CFD) (34Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Solution structure of calcium-free calmodulin.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2 (7552748): 768-77610.1038/nsb0995-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). In the N-domain (Fig. 1A), differences are observed in the Ca2+-binding loops in both EF-hands but also in the flexible loop connecting the two EF-hands between helix B and C. No structural changes are observed in helix C harboring Ile53, which protrudes into the solvent like Asn53 in the WT. The variation in the 20 apoCaM-N53I structures is largest in the aforementioned loop regions. Comparing the apoCaM-N53I and apoCaM-WT C-domains (Fig. 1B), similar loop flexibility is observed with both interhelical loops and the EF-hand–connecting loop being flexible. Overall, the apoCaM-N53I C-domain is less well-defined than the N-domain because of a lower density of NOEs in the C-domain, but the same observation holds true for apoCaM-WT (35Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Calcium-induced conformational transition revealed by the solution structure of apo calmodulin.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2 (7552747): 758-76710.1038/nsb0995-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Because of the structural similarity between apoCaM-WT and apoCaM-N53I, we analyzed chemical shift differences in the [1H-15N]-HSQCs to see which other residues were affected by the mutation (Fig. S1). As expected, the residues near the mutated Ile53 residue are affected because the chemical environment changes by substituting an amino acid. Notably, the two Ca2+-coordinating residues Asn60 and Thr62 are also affected, even though they are 10–12 Å away from Ile53. The ensemble of Ca2+/CaM-N53I structures is compared with the first structure of the Ca2+/CaM-WT ensemble (PDB code 1X02) (36Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

https://openalex.org/W3016889233,"This article proposes a conceptual and methodological framework for analyzing agroecosystem resilience, in which aspects such as agrarian structure and peasant community agency are included as determining factors. The methodology is applied to a comparison of two peasant communities in Latin America (Brazil and Colombia), emphasizing the capacity to transform unsustainable power structures in place of adapting to them. We find that when agrarian structure is more equitable and peasant agency is strongly developed through political formation, organization and women's participation, then there is a greater construction of resilience that improves peasant livelihoods and dignity. This application demonstrates that when agency is strongly developed, as in the case of Brazil, it is possible to transform structural conditions that restrict resilience. The inclusion and consideration of biophysical variables, management practices, agrarian structure and agency, through a participatory approach, allows for the identification of factors that inhibit or potentiate the resilience of agroecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3016965756,"Background Evidence has shown that deep learning computer aided detection (CADe) system achieved high overall detection accuracy for polyp detection during colonoscopy. Aim The detection performance of CADe system on non-polypoid laterally spreading tumors (LSTs) and sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps), with higher risk for malignancy transformation and miss rate, has not been exclusively investigated. Methods A previously validated deep learning CADe system for polyp detection was tested exclusively on LSTs and SSA/Ps. 1451 LST images from 184 patients were collected between July 2015 and January 2019, 82 SSA/Ps videos from 26 patients were collected between September 2018 and January 2019. The per-frame sensitivity and per-lesion sensitivity were calculated. Results (1) For LSTs image dataset, the system achieved an overall per-image sensitivity and per-lesion sensitivity of 94.07% (1365/1451) and 98.99% (197/199) respectively. The per-frame sensitivity for LST-G(H), LST-G(M), LST-NG(F), LST-NG(PD) was 93.97% (343/365), 98.72% (692/701), 85.71% (324/378) and 85.71% (6/7) respectively. The per-lesion sensitivity of each subgroup was 100.00% (71/71), 100.00% (64/64), 98.31% (58/59) and 80.00% (4/5). (2) For SSA/Ps video dataset, the system achieved an overall per-frame sensitivity and per-lesion sensitivity of 84.10% (15883/18885) and 100.00% (42/42), respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrated that a local-feature-prioritized automatic CADe system could detect LSTs and SSA/Ps with high sensitivity. The per-frame sensitivity for non-granular LSTs and small SSA/Ps should be further improved."
https://openalex.org/W3016690761,"Campylobacter jejuni has caused several campylobacteriosis outbreaks via raw milk consumption. This study reports follow-up of a milk-borne campylobacteriosis outbreak that revealed persistent C. jejuni contamination of bulk tank milk for seven months or longer. Only the outbreak-causing strain, representing sequence type (ST) 883, was isolated from milk, although other C. jejuni STs were also isolated from the farm. We hypothesized that the outbreak strain harbors features that aid its environmental transmission or survival in milk. To identify such phenotypic features, the outbreak strain was characterized for survival in refrigerated raw milk and in aerobic broth culture by plate counting and for biofilm formation on microplates by crystal violet staining and quantification. Furthermore, whole-genome sequences were studied for such genotypic features. For comparison, we characterized isolates representing other STs from the same farm and an ST-883 isolate that persisted on another dairy farm, but was not isolated from bulk tank milk. With high inocula (105 CFU/ml), ST-883 strains survived in refrigerated raw milk longer (4–6 days) than the other strains (≤3 days), but the outbreak strain showed no outperformance among ST-883 strains. This suggests that ST-883 strains may share features that aid their survival in milk, but other mechanisms are required for persistence in milk. No correlation was observed between survival in refrigerated milk and aerotolerance. The outbreak strain formed a biofilm, offering a potential explanation for persistence in milk. Whether biofilm formation was affected by pTet-like genomic element and phase-variable genes encoding capsular methyltransferase and cytochrome C551 peroxidase warrants further study. This study suggests a phenotypic target candidate for interventions and genetic markers for the phenotype, which should be investigated further with the final aim of developing control strategies against C. jejuni infections."
https://openalex.org/W3016728675,"The GPR17 receptor, expressed on oligodendroglial precursors (OPCs, the myelin producing cells), has emerged as an attractive target for a pro-myelinating strategy in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the proof-of-concept that selective GPR17 ligands actually exert protective activity in vivo is still missing. Here, we exploited an iterative drug discovery pipeline to prioritize novel and selective GPR17 pro-myelinating agents out of more than 1,000,000 compounds. We first performed an in silico high-throughput screening on GPR17 structural model to identify three chemically-diverse ligand families that were then combinatorially exploded and refined. Top-scoring compounds were sequentially tested on reference pharmacological in vitro assays with increasing complexity, ending with myelinating OPC-neuron co-cultures. Successful ligands were filtered through in silico simulations of metabolism and pharmacokinetics, to select the most promising hits, whose dose and ability to target the central nervous system were then determined in vivo. Finally, we show that, when administered according to a preventive protocol, one of them (named by us as galinex) is able to significantly delay the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. This outcome validates the predictivity of our pipeline to identify novel MS-modifying agents."

However, the mechanisms underlying allosteric PfPKG inhibition are incompletely understood. Here, we show that 8-NBD-cGMP is an effective PfPKG antagonist.

Using NMR chemical shift analyses, molecular dynamics simulations, and site-directed mutagenesis, we show that 8-NBD-cGMP inhibits PfPKG not simply by reverting a two-state active versus inactive equilibrium, but by sampling also a distinct inactive intermediate. Surface plasmon resonance indicates that the ability to stabilize a mixed intermediate provides a means to effectively inhibit PfPKG, without losing affinity for the cGMP analog. Our proposed model may facilitate the rational design of PfPKG-selective inhibitors for improved management of malaria."
https://openalex.org/W3016730638,"Background Recurrent skin abscesses are often associated with Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing strains of S. aureus (PVL-SA). Decolonization measures are required along with treatment of active infections to prevent re-infection and spreading. Even though most PVL-SA patients are treated as outpatients, there are few studies that assess the effectiveness of outpatient topical decolonization in PVL-SA patients. Methods We assessed the results of topical decolonization of PVL-SA in a retrospective review of patient files and personal interviews. Successful decolonization was defined as the absence of any skin abscesses for at least 6 months after completion of the final decolonization treatment. Clinical and demographic data was assessed. An intention-to-treat protocol was used. Results Our cohort consisted of 115 symptomatic patients, 66% from PVL-positive MSSA and 19% from PVL-positive MRSA. The remaining 16% consisted of symptomatic patients with close contact to PVL-SA positive index patients but without detection of PVL-SA. The majority of patients were female (66%). The median age was 29.87% of the patients lived in multiple person households. Our results showed a 48% reduction in symptomatic PVL-SA cases after the first decolonization treatment. The results also showed that the decrease continued with each repeated decolonization treatment and reached 89% following the 5th treatment. A built multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model showed that the absence of PVL-SA detection (OR 2.0) and living in single person households (OR 2.4) were associated with an independently increased chance of successful decolonization. Conclusion In our cohort, topical decolonization was a successful preventive measure for reducing the risk of PVL-SA skin abscesses in the outpatient setting. Special attention should be given to patients living in multiple person households because these settings could confer a risk that decolonization will not be successful."
https://openalex.org/W3016710131,"The current study aims to examine the construct of empowerment in the context of a transition education program. Patient education programs strive to empower adolescents with chronic conditions to take responsibility for their own health care to manage their transition from pediatric to adult medicine. Our study aimed to identify the core components of patient empowerment and examined whether its components are responsive to a patient education program.Data was collected in two longitudinal studies involving N = 723 adolescents with chronic conditions. We used Latent Difference Score models (LDSm) of: 1) self-efficacy (GSE), 2) transition competence (TCS), and 3) patient activation (PAM) to quantify the latent variable of patient empowerment (PE). Additionally, the LDSm were extended to analyze the effects of group affiliation (intervention vs. control) and participants' age on empowerment.PE was identifiable by the three components. The intervention group developed significantly higher scores of PE compared to the control group. Age (13-21 years) did not moderate the relation between group affiliation and PE.We quantified PE successfully using a psychometric modeling of change. Patient empowerment is measureable and utilizable in the specific context of transition of adolescents with chronic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3016881734,"Dosimetry is an important tool for triage and treatment planning following any radiation exposure accident, and biological dosimetry, which estimates exposure dose using a biological parameter, is a practical means of determining the specific dose an individual receives. The cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay (CBMN) is an established biodosimetric tool to measure chromosomal damage in mitogen-stimulated human lymphocytes. The CBMN method is especially valuable for biodosimetry in triage situations thanks to simplicity in scoring and adaptability to high-throughput automated sample processing systems. While this technique produces dose-response data which fit very well to a linear-quadratic model for exposures to low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation and for doses up for 5 Gy, limitations to the accuracy of this method arise at larger doses. Accuracy at higher doses is limited by the number of cells reaching mitosis. Whereas it would be expected that the yield of micronuclei increases with the dose, in many experiments it has been shown to actually decrease when normalized over the total number of cells. This variation from a monotonically increasing dose response poses a limitation for retrospective dose reconstruction. In this study we modified the standard CBMN assay to increase its accuracy following exposures to higher doses of photons or a mixed neutron–photon beam. The assay is modified either through inhibitions of the G2/M and spindle checkpoints with the addition of caffeine and/or ZM447439 (an Aurora kinase inhibitor), respectively to the blood cultures at select times during the assay. Our results showed that caffeine addition improved assay performance for photon up to 10 Gy. This was achieved by extending the assay time from the typical 70 h to just 74 h. Compared to micronuclei yields without inhibitors, addition of caffeine and ZM447439 resulted in improved accuracy in the detection of micronuclei yields up to 10 Gy from photons and 4 Gy of mixed neutrons-photons. When the dose-effect curves were fitted to take into account the turnover phenomenon observed at higher doses, best fitting was achieved when the combination of both inhibitors was used. These techniques permit reliable dose reconstruction after high doses of radiation with a method that can be adapted to high-throughput automated sample processing systems."
https://openalex.org/W3016996481,"Deltaic wetlands are highly productive ecosystems, which characteristically can act as C-sinks. However, they are among the most threatened ecosystems, being very vulnerable to global change, and require special attention towards its conservation. Knowing their climate change mitigating potential, conservation measures should also be oriented with a climatic approach, to strengthen their regulatory services. In this work we studied the carbon biogeochemistry and the specific relevance of certain microbial guilds on carbon metabolisms of the three main types of deltaic wetlands located in the Ebro Delta, north-eastern Spain, as well as how they deal with human pressures and climate change effects. We estimated the metabolic rates of the main carbon-related metabolisms (primary production and respiration) and the resulting carbon and global warming potential balances in sites with a different salinity range and trophic status. With the results obtained, we tried to define the influence of possible changes in salinity and trophic level linked to the main impacts currently threatening deltaic wetlands, on the C-metabolisms and GHG emissions, for a better understanding of the mitigating capacity and their possible enhancement when applying specific management actions. Metabolic rates showed a pattern highly influenced by the salinity range and nutrients inputs. Freshwater and brackish wetlands, with higher nutrient inputs from agricultural runoff, showed higher C-capture capacity (around 220–250 g C m-2 y-1), but also higher rates of degradative metabolisms (aerobic respiration and CH4 emissions). Contrastingly, the rates of C-related metabolisms and C-retention of Salicornia-type coastal salt marshes were lower (42 g C m-2 y-1). The study of the microbial metacommunity composition by the16S RNA gene sequencing revealed a significant higher presence of methanogens in the salt marsh, and also higher metabolic potential, where there was significantly more organic matter content in sediment. Salinity inhibition, however, explained the lower respiration rates, both aerobic and anaerobic, and prevented higher rates of methanogenesis despite the major presence of methanogens. Conservation measures for these wetlands would require, overall, maintaining the sediment contributions of the river basin intending to overcome the regression of the Delta and its salt marshes in a climate change scenario. Particularly, for reducing degradative metabolisms, and favour C-retention, nutrient inputs should be controlled in freshwater and brackish wetlands in order to reduce eutrophication. In salt marshes, the reduction of salinity should be avoided to control increases in methanogenesis and CH4 emissions."
https://openalex.org/W3017344672,"Introduction Survival after trauma has considerably improved. This warrants research on non-fatal outcome. We aimed to identify characteristics associated with both short and long-term health status (HS) after trauma and to describe the recovery patterns of HS and psychological outcomes during 24 months of follow-up. Methods Hospitalized patients with all types of injuries were included. Data were collected at 1 week 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-trauma. HS was assessed with the EuroQol-5D-3L (EQ-5D-3L) and the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 and 3 (HUI2/3). For the screening of symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression, the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) subscale anxiety (HADSA) and subscale depression (HADSD) were used. Recovery patterns of HS and psychological outcomes were examined with linear mixed model analyses. Results A total of 4,883 patients participated (median age 68 (Interquartile range 53–80); 50% response rate). The mean (Standard Deviation (SD)) pre-injury EQ-5D-3L score was 0.85 (0.23). One week post-trauma, mean (SD) EQ-5D-3L, HUI2 and HUI3 scores were 0.49 (0.32), 0.61 (0.22) and 0.38 (0.31), respectively. These scores significantly improved to 0.77 (0.26), 0.77 (0.21) and 0.62 (0.35), respectively, at 24 months. Most recovery occurred up until 3 months. At long-term follow-up, patients of higher age, with comorbidities, longer hospital stay, lower extremity fracture and spine injury showed lower HS. The mean (SD) scores of the IES, HADSA and HADSD were respectively 14.80 (15.80), 4.92 (3.98) and 5.00 (4.28), respectively, at 1 week post-trauma and slightly improved over 24 months post-trauma to 10.35 (14.72), 4.31 (3.76) and 3.62 (3.87), respectively. Discussion HS and psychological symptoms improved over time and most improvements occurred within 3 months post-trauma. The effects of severity and type of injury faded out over time. Patients frequently reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02508675."
https://openalex.org/W3016838396,"The Arctic Ocean is an early warning system for indicators and effects of climate change. We use a novel combination of experimental and time-series data on effects of ocean warming and acidification on the commercially important Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) to incorporate these physiological processes into the recruitment model of the fish population. By running an ecological-economic optimization model, we investigate how the interaction of ocean warming, acidification and fishing pressure affects the sustainability of the fishery in terms of ecological, economic, social and consumer-related indicators, ranging from present day conditions up to future climate change scenarios. We find that near-term climate change will benefit the fishery, but under likely future warming and acidification this large fishery is at risk of collapse by the end of the century, even with the best adaptation effort in terms of reduced fishing pressure."
https://openalex.org/W3017129837,"There is limited research on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in humanitarian settings despite the overall global burden and disproportionate growth in many conflicts and disaster-prone settings. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of NCDs and assess the perceived effect of conflict on NCD severity and access to treatment among conflict-affected adults (≥ 30 years) in Ukraine.We conducted two population-representative, stratified, cross-sectional household surveys: one among adult internally displaced people (IDPs) throughout Ukraine and one among adults living in Donbas in eastern Ukraine. One randomly selected adult per household answered questions about their demographics, height and weight, diagnosed NCDs, access to medications and healthcare since the conflict began, as well as questions assessing psychological distress, trauma exposure, and posttraumatic stress disorder. More than half of participants reported having at least one NCD (55.7% Donbas; 59.8% IDPs) A higher proportion of IDPs compared to adults in Donbas experienced serious psychological distress (29.9% vs. 18.7%), interruptions in care (9.7-14.3% vs. 23.1-51.3%), and interruptions in medication than adults in Donbas (14.9-45.6% vs. 30.2-77.5%). Factors associated with perceived worsening of disease included psychological distress (p: 0.002-0.043), displacement status (IDP vs. Donbas) (p: <0.001-0.011), interruptions in medication (p: 0.002-0.004), and inability to see a doctor at some point since the start of the conflict (p: <0.001-0.008).Our study found a high burden of NCDs among two conflict-affected populations in Ukraine and identified obstacles to accessing care and medication. Psychological distress, interruptions to care, and interruptions in medication were all reported by a higher proportion of IDPs than adults in Donbas. There is a need for targeted policies and programs to support the unique needs of displaced conflict-affected individuals in Ukraine that address the economic and perceived barriers to NCD treatment and care."
https://openalex.org/W3017214811,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease characterized by periods of activity and remission. The platelet, one of the main activators of neutrophils, contains Interleukin 8 (IL-8), a potent neutrophil chemo-attractant and P-selectin that induces excretion of superoxide in the neutrophils, forming platelet-neutrophil aggregates that are increased in individuals with active UC, hence an index of both cells could produce a monitoring tool. No previous studies have evaluated this ratio in UC.To evaluate the clinical utility of the Neutrophil-Platelet (NeuPla) ratio in patients with UC.A total of 158 patients with a diagnosis of UC. This index was based on the ratio between platelets and the neutrophil differential in blood count. The activity was classified using Mayo endoscopic sub-score, histological (Riley score) and for clinical was used the Truelove-Witts, Montreal, Mayo and Yamamoto-Furusho scores.The correlation of the NeuPla ratio with activity scales were significant (P <0.05). An optimal cut-off point to classify patients with clinical activity was 14.94 with a sensitivity 87.95% and specificity 63.5 and endoscopy activity with a cut-off 14.64 with a sensibility of 70.5% and specificity of 61.8%.The NeuPla ratio showed an adequate diagnostic utility to identify UC patients with clinical and endoscopy activity without the use of invasive studies like a colonoscopy or expensive fecal biomarkers such as calprotectin and have a better diagnostic performance in comparison to other serum biomarkers (C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and albumin)."
https://openalex.org/W3016694539,"Identify the prevalence of HPV infections in the uterine cervix and oral cavity and HPV16 variants in HIV+ women.A total of 174 HIV+ women attended an HIV+ specialized clinic in Mexico City. Cells were obtained from the oral cavity and cervix to extract DNA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the HPV sequence with generic primers. We detected specific HPV types using the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra II Kit (INNOGENETICS). The identification of variants was studied by sequencing the E6 gene with a Big Dye Terminator Kit and an Applied Biosystems 3500/3500xL genetic analyzer.HPV infection was very high in the uterine cervix (168/174, 96.6%) and oral cavity (161/174, 92.5%). The prevalence of HPV concurrent infections in the cervix and oral cavity was 155/174 (89.1%). We found hrHPVs to be more prevalent than low-risk HPVs (lrHPVs) in the oral cavity (90.2% versus 45.4%) and that infections simultaneously affected the cervix (94.3% versus 36.2%) and oral cavity (85.1% versus 20.1%). Surprisingly, only European variants of HPV type 16 were found in the uterine cervix of women and the oral cavity of all tested samples (52 oral cavity samples and 52 uterine cervix samples).The high prevalence of HPV, multiple infections and presence of the EP350G intravariant in both anatomical regions are strongly related to the persistence of the virus, which is fundamental for the development of cancer. Therefore, it is very important to control and monitor this high-risk population as well as implement programs for the early detection of HPV and vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3016802754,"Hypertension occurs at a higher rate in African Americans than in European Americans. Based on the assumption that causal variants are more frequently found on DNA segments inherited from the ancestral population with higher disease risk, we employed admixture mapping to identify genetic loci with excess local African ancestry associated with blood pressure. Chromosomal regions 1q21.2–21.3, 4p15.1, 19q12 and 20p13 were significantly associated with diastolic blood pressure (β = 5.28, -7.94, -6.82 and 5.89, P-value = 6.39E-04, 2.07E-04, 6.56E-05 and 5.04E-04, respectively); 1q21.2–21.3 and 19q12 were also significantly associated with mean arterial pressure (β = 5.86 and -6.40, P-value = 5.32E-04 and 6.37E-04, respectively). We further selected SNPs that had large allele frequency differences within these regions and tested their association with blood pressure. SNP rs4815428 was significantly associated with diastolic blood pressure after Bonferroni correction (β = -2.42, P-value = 9.57E-04), and it partially explained the admixture mapping signal at 20p13. SNPs rs771205 (β = -1.99, P-value = 3.37E-03), rs3126067, rs2184953 and rs58001094 (the latter three exhibit strong linkage disequilibrium, β = -2.3, P-value = 1.4E-03) were identified to be significantly associated with mean arterial pressure, and together they fully explained the admixture signal at 1q21.2–21.3. Although no SNP at 4p15.1 showed large ancestral allele frequency differences in our dataset, we detected association at low-frequency African-specific variants that mapped predominantly to the gene PCDH7, which is most highly expressed in aorta. Our results suggest that these regions may harbor genetic variants that contribute to the different prevalence of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3017240485,"Activation of the T cell receptor (TCR) results in binding of the adapter protein Nck (noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase) to the CD3ϵ subunit of the TCR. The interaction was suggested to be important for the amplification of TCR signals and is governed by a proline-rich sequence (PRS) in CD3ϵ that binds to the first Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Nck (Nck-SH3.1). Inhibition of this protein/protein interaction ameliorated inflammatory symptoms in mouse models of multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and asthma. A small molecule, AX-024, was reported to inhibit the Nck/CD3ϵ interaction by physically binding to the Nck1-SH3.1 domain, suggesting a route to develop an inhibitor of the Nck1/CD3ϵ interaction for modulating TCR activity in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We show here that AX-024 reduces T cell proliferation upon weak TCR stimulation but does not significantly affect phosphorylation of Zap70 (ζ chain of T cell receptor–associated protein kinase 70). We also find that AX-024 is likely not involved in modulating the Nck/TCR interaction but probably has other targets in T cells. An array of biophysical techniques did not detect a direct interaction between AX-024 and Nck-SH3.1 in vitro. Crystal structures of the Nck-SH3.1 domain revealed its binding mode to the PRS in CD3ϵ. The SH3 domain tends to generate homodimers through a domain swap. Domain swaps observed previously in other SH3 domains indicate a general propensity of this protein fold to exchange structural elements. The swapped form of Nck-SH3.1 is unable to bind CD3ϵ, possibly representing an inactive form of Nck in cells."
https://openalex.org/W3016385423,"Purpose Diagnosis and resection of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) is a growing challenge with increased utilization of chest computed tomography. Photoacoustic (PA) -guided surgical resection with local injection of indocyanine green (ICG) may have utility for IPNs that are suspicious for lung cancer. This preclinical study explores the potential of PA imaging (PAI) to detect ICG-labeled tumors. Materials and methods ICG uptake by H460 lung cancer cells was evaluated in vitro. A phantom study was performed to analyze PA signal intensity according to ICG concentration and tissue thickness/depth using chicken breast. PA signals were measured up to 48 hours after injection of ICG (mixed with 5% agar) into healthy subcutaneous tissue, subcutaneous H460 tumors and right healthy lung in nude mice. Results Intracellular ICG fluorescence was detected in H460 cells co-incubated with ICG in vitro. The concentration dependence of the PA signal was logarithmic, and PA signal decline was exponential with increasing tissue depth. The PA signal of 2 mg/mL ICG was still detectable at a depth of 22 mm in chicken breast. The PA signal from ICG mixed with agar was detectable 48 hours post injection into subcutaneous tissue and subcutaneous H460 tumors in nude mice. Similar features of PA signals from ICG-agar in mice lung were obtained. Conclusion The results from this preclinical study suggests that PAI of injected ICG-agar may be beneficial for identifying deeply located tumors. These features may be valuable for IPNs."

However, the underlying mechanisms of ischemic damage and repair systems remain largely unknown. In order to better understand these mechanisms, TMT-isobaric mass tagging and mass spectrometry were conducted on brain cortex extracts from mice subjected to one hour of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and after one hour of reperfusion. In total, 2,690 proteins were identified and quantified, out of which 65% of the top 5% of up- and down-regulated proteins were found to be significant (p < 0.05). Network-based gene ontology analysis was then utilized to cluster all identified proteins by protein functional groups and cellular roles. Although three different cellular functions were identified—organelle outer membrane proteins, cytosolic ribosome proteins, and spliceosome complex proteins—several functional domains were found to be common. Of these, organelle outer membrane proteins were downregulated whereas cytosolic ribosome and spliceosome complex proteins were upregulated, indicating that major molecular events post-stroke were translation-associated and subsequent signaling pathways (e.g., poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) dependent cell death). By approaching stroke analyses via TMT-isobaric mass tagging, the work herein presents a grand scope of protein-based molecular mechanisms involved with ischemic stroke recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3016558758,"Introduction Phenotype-driven rare disease gene prioritization relies on high quality curated resources containing disease, gene and phenotype annotations. However, the effectiveness of gene prioritization tools is constrained by the incomplete coverage of rare disease, phenotype and gene annotations in such curated resources. Methods We extracted rare disease correlation pairs involving diseases, phenotypes and genes from MEDLINE abstracts and used the information propagation algorithm GCAS to build an association network. We built a tool called PRIORI-T for rare disease gene prioritization that uses this network for phenotype-driven rare disease gene prioritization. The quality of disease-gene associations in PRIORI-T was compared with resources such as DisGeNET and Open Targets in the context of rare diseases. The gene prioritization performance of PRIORI-T was evaluated using phenotype descriptions of 230 real-world rare disease clinical cases collated from recent publications, as well as compared to other gene prioritization tools such as HANRD and Orphamizer. Results PRIORI-T contains qualitatively better associations than DisGeNET and Open Targets. Furthermore, the causal genes were captured within Top-50 for more than 40% of the real-world clinical cases and within Top-300 for more than 72% of the cases when PRIORI-T was used for gene prioritization. It outperformed other gene prioritization tools such as HANRD and Orphamizer that primarily rely on curated resources. Conclusions PRIORI-T exhibited improved gene prioritization performance without requiring high quality curated data. Thus, it holds great promise in phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare disease studies."
https://openalex.org/W3016692765,"Background & objective Deficits in cognitive functions dependent upon the integrity of the prefrontal cortex have been described in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In a series of studies we have shown that fluid intelligence (g) is a substantial contributor to frontal deficits and that, for some classical “executive” tasks, frontal deficits were entirely explained by g. However, for another group of frontal tasks deficits remained once g was introduced as a covariate. This second set of tests included multitasking and theory of mind tasks. In the present study, we aimed at determining the role of fluid intelligence in frontal deficits seen in patients with MS. Methods A group of patients with Relapsing Remitting MS (n = 36) and a group of control subjects (n = 42) were assessed with a battery of classical executive tests (which included the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Verbal Fluency, and Trail Making Test B), a multitasking test, a theory of mind test and a fluid intelligence test. Results MS patients showed significant deficits in the fluid intelligence task. We found differences between patients and control subjects in all tests except for the multitasking test. The differences in the classical executive tests became non-significant once fluid intelligence was introduced as a covariate, but differences in theory of mind remained. Conclusions The present results suggest that fluid intelligence can be affected in MS and that this impairment can play a role in the executive deficits described in MS."
https://openalex.org/W3016514401,"Mutations in the splicing machinery have been implicated in a number of human diseases. Most notably, the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) component SF3b1 has been found to be frequently mutated in blood cancers such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). SF3b1 is a highly conserved HEAT repeat (HR)-containing protein and most of these blood cancer mutations cluster in a hot spot located in HR4-8. Recently, a second mutational hotspot has been identified in SF3b1 located in HR9-12 and is associated with acute myeloid leukemias, bladder urothelial carcinomas, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinomas. The consequences of these mutations on SF3b1 functions during splicing have not yet been tested. We incorporated the corresponding mutations into the yeast homolog of SF3b1 and tested their impact on splicing. We find that all of these HR9-12 mutations can support splicing in yeast, and this suggests that none of them are loss of function alleles in humans. The Hsh155V502F mutation alters splicing of several pre-mRNA reporters containing weak branch sites as well as a genetic interaction with Prp2 and physical interactions with Prp5 and Prp3. The ability of a single allele of Hsh155 to perturb interactions with multiple factors functioning at different stages of the splicing reaction suggests that some SF3b1-mutant disease phenotypes may have a complex origin on the spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W3016969261,"Enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) catalyzes a rate-controlling step in bacterial fatty-acid synthesis and is a target for antibacterial drug development. A phylogenetic analysis shows that FabIs fall into four divergent clades. Members of clades 1-3 have been structurally and biochemically characterized, but the fourth clade, found in members of phylum Bacteroidetes, is uncharacterized. Here, we identified the unique structure and conformational changes that distinguish clade 4 FabIs. Alistipes finegoldii is a prototypical Bacteroidetes inhabitant of the gut microbiome. We found that A. finegoldii FabI (AfFabI) displays cooperative kinetics and uses NADH as a cofactor, and its crystal structure at 1.72 Å resolution showed that it adopts a Rossmann fold as do other characterized FabIs. It also disclosed a carboxyl-terminal extension that forms a helix-helix interaction that links the protomers as a unique feature of AfFabI. An AfFabI·NADH crystal structure at 1.86 Å resolution revealed that this feature undergoes a large conformational change to participate in covering the NADH-binding pocket and establishing the water channels that connect the active site to the central water well. Progressive deletion of these interactions led to catalytically compromised proteins that fail to bind NADH. This unique conformational change imparted a distinct shape to the AfFabI active site that renders it refractory to a FabI drug that targets clade 1 and 3 pathogens. We conclude that the clade 4 FabI, found in the Bacteroidetes inhabitants of the gut, have several structural features and conformational transitions that distinguish them from other bacterial FabIs."
https://openalex.org/W3016300374,"Typically discretisation procedures are implemented as a part of initial pre-processing of data, before knowledge mining is employed. It means that conclusions and observations are based on reduced data, as usually by discretisation some information is discarded. The paper presents a different approach, with taking advantage of discretisation executed after data mining. In the described study firstly decision rules were induced from real-valued features. Secondly, data sets were discretised. Using categories found for attributes, in the third step conditions included in inferred rules were translated into discrete domain. The properties and performance of rule classifiers were tested in the domain of stylometric analysis of texts, where writing styles were defined through quantitative attributes of continuous nature. The performed experiments show that the proposed processing leads to sets of rules with significantly reduced sizes while maintaining quality of predictions, and allows to test many data discretisation methods at the acceptable computational costs."
https://openalex.org/W3016573162,"Environmental education programs are critically important for raising awareness about global and local environmental concerns, by providing the knowledge, tools, and means for young and old generations to cope with current challenges. Of the greatest importance is the implementation of environmental education programs in biodiversity hotspots where environmental crises are high and resources to fund mitigation programs are low. Madagascar is one such priority hotspot, featuring intensive wildlife-human conflicts due to shrinking natural environments. The Duke Lemur Center-SAVA Conservation Initiative has been conducting environmental education activities in the SAVA region, northeastern Madagascar, since 2011. These activities have been aimed at increasing awareness of local and global environmental issues and at stimulating the involvement of local school students. Our initiatives have predominantly supported teacher trainings to provide teachers with environmental education content, examples, and recommendations on how to integrate activities into their regular curricula, commonly referred to as a ""cascade approach"". Due to logistical hurdles, including high teacher turnover rates, however, these interventions have not been monitored to assess their efficacy. Thus, to better inform current and future interventions, we designed and implemented classroom-based surveys to gather baseline data on the basic knowledge of SAVA students and their perceptions of the environment. We identify informational gaps in surveyed schools, including those located in large towns vs. villages, and those with trained vs. untrained teachers. Based on these results, we make recommendations for future environmental education efforts in the region, including activities that could address real-life environmental problems and decision-making solutions."

We used an integrative social psychological framework for analyzing online hate offending and found that both personal risk factors and online group behavior were associated with online hate offending. Study 1, based on socio-demographically balanced survey data (N = 1200) collected from Finnish adolescents and young adults, found that impulsivity and internalizing symptoms were positively associated with online hate offending. Furthermore, social homophily was positively associated with online hate offending but only among those with average or high level of internalizing symptoms. Social identification with online communities was not associated with hate offending. In Study 2, based on a vignette experiment (N = 160), online hate offenders were more likely than others to rely on in-group stereotypes (i.e. self-stereotype) in anonymous online interaction and, as a consequence, follow perceived group norms. These associations were found only when a shared group identity was primed. We conclude that both personal risk factors and group behavior are related to online hate but they have different implications for reducing hateful communication in social media."

Here we investigated the expression and cellular distribution of aplnr, apln and the recently described ligand apela (apela) in the CVOs and investigated whether differences in the levels of expression of apelinergic gene transcripts in these regions might underlie the chronic elevated blood pressure seen in hypertension. We carried out multiplex in situ hybridization histochemistry on CVO tissue sections from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) controls. Confocal immunofluorescent images indicated strong aplnr expression, with lower levels of apln and modest apela expression, in the CVOs of both WKY rats and SHRs, in both neurons and glia. The expression level of aplnr transcripts was increased in the SFO of SHRs compared to WKY rats. Our data may highlight a potential dysfunction in the communication between CVOs and downstream signalling pathways in SHRs, which may contribute to its different phenotype/s."
https://openalex.org/W3016501207,"Vincristine is a commonly used cytostatic drug for the treatment of leukemia, neuroblastoma and lung cancer, which is known to have neurotoxic properties. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of vincristine, injected directly into the dorsal hippocampus, in spatial memory using the spatial cone field discrimination task. Long Evans rats were trained in the cone field, and after reaching training criterion received bilateral vincristine infusions into the dorsal hippocampus. Vincristine-treated animals presented unilateral or bilateral hippocampal lesions. Animals with bilateral lesions showed lower spatial working and reference memory performance than control animals, but task motivation was unaffected by the lesions. Working and reference memory of animals with unilateral lesions did not differ from animals with bilateral lesions and control animals. In sum, intrahippocampal injection of vincristine caused profound tissue damage in the dorsal hippocampus, associated with substantial cognitive deficits."

This study adds to the existing knowledge by providing a further exploration of the association between relative age and the performance trajectories over four years in youth players of an individual skill/technique based sport: table tennis. Data of 1000 French male and female youth top 100 players across five ages (U14, U15, U16, U17 and U18) were collected from the ranking lists over a four-year period. A series of latent growth analysis was conducted per subsample and revealed three performance trajectories for male U14, U16 and U17 as well as for female U17 and U18 and four performance trajectories for male U15 and U18 and female U14, U15 and U16. Results of chi-square tests revealed that the players’ birth quartiles were significantly associated with the performance trajectories only for male players U18 with a large effect size (p = 0.01; W = .48). All other male subsample only showed a trend for the male subsamples for those born in the fourth quartile. No relations or trends were found in the female subsamples. Future research in relative age effects should further explore individual characteristics and pathways while using a longitudinal approach in a prospective design and evaluate influencing constraints (and solutions) in a more comprehensive way."
https://openalex.org/W3016512602,"Many poststroke hemiplegic patients have an asymmetrical wheelchair-sitting posture. This study aimed to investigate the impact of different back support shapes on asymmetrical sitting posture and pressure points among poststroke hemiplegic patients during an activities of daily living-related reaching task. This study included 23 poststroke hemiplegic patients who performed tasks that involved the movement of objects using the unaffected upper limb to the affected side while sitting in a conventional wheelchair (C-WC) with a flat back support or a wheelchair providing pelvic and thoracic support (P-WC). Body alignment angles from video images and pressure distribution on supporting surfaces were measured using a two-dimensional motion analysis software (Dartfish) and a pressure mapping system (FSA). Regarding movement performance, although postural asymmetry increased in both wheelchair types, the degree of postural variation was smaller with P-WC use than C-WC use (p < 0.05), with partly reduced postural asymmetry. With P-WC, one-sided ischial asymmetrical pressure was significantly less after the movement (p < 0.05). In conclusion, P-WC's back support shape contributed to a decrease in postural asymmetry for pelvic girdle support both at rest and during movement. This highlights the importance of a wheelchair back support shape and may help to increase the quality of activities of daily living movement in poststroke hemiplegic patients in wheelchairs."
https://openalex.org/W3016565077,"Exposure to ionizing radiation contributing to negative health outcomes is a widespread concern. However, the impact of low dose and sub-lethal dose radiation (SLDR) exposures remain contentious, particularly in pregnant women who represent a vulnerable group. The fetal programming hypothesis states that an adverse in utero environment or stress during development of an embryo or fetus can result in permanent physiologic changes often resulting in progressive metabolic dysfunction with age. To assess changes in gene expression profiles of glucose/insulin signaling and lipid metabolism caused by radiation exposure in utero, pregnant C57Bl/6J mice were irradiated using a dose response ranging from low dose to SLDR and compared to a Sham-irradiated group. mRNA expression analysis in 16 week old offspring (n = 84) revealed that genes involved in metabolic function including glucose metabolism, insulin signaling and lipid metabolism were unaffected by prenatal radiation exposures up to 300 mGy. However, female offspring of dams exposed to 1000 mGy had upregulated expression of genes contributing to insulin resistance and gluconeogenesis. In a second cohort of mice, the effects of SLDR on fetal programming of hepatic SOCS3 and PEPCK protein expression were assessed. 4 month old female offspring of dams irradiated at 1000 mGy had: 1) increased liver weights, 2) increased hepatic expression of proteins involved in glucose metabolism and 3) increased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) measured by positron emission tomography (PET) (n = 25). The results of this study indicate that prenatal radiation exposure does not affect metabolic function up to 300 mGy and 1000 mGy may be a threshold dose for sex-specific alterations in glucose uptake and hepatic gene and protein expression of SOCS3, PEPCK, PPARGC1A and PPARGC1B. These findings suggest that SLDR doses alter glucose uptake in IBAT and hepatic gene and protein expression of offspring and these changes may progress with age."
https://openalex.org/W3017328214,"In the field of fashion design, designing garment image according to texture is actually changing the shape of texture image, and image-to-image translation based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can do this well. This can help fashion designers save a lot of time and energy. GAN-based image-to-image translation has made great progress in recent years. One of the image-to-image translation models––StarGAN, has realized the function of multi-domain image-to-image translation by using only a single generator and a single discriminator. This paper details the use of StarGAN to complete the task of garment design. Users only need to input an image and a label for the garment type to generate garment images with the texture of the input image. However, it was found that the quality of the generated images is not satisfactory. Therefore, this paper introduces some improvements on the structure of the StarGAN generator and the loss function of StarGAN, and a model was obtained that can be better applied to garment design. It is called GD-StarGAN. This paper will demonstrate that GD-StarGAN is much better than StarGAN when it comes to garment design, especially in texture, by using a set of seven categories of garment datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3017124181,"At the molecular level, the circadian clock is regulated by a time delayed transcriptional-translational feedback loop in which the core proteins interact with each other rhythmically to drive daily biological rhythms. The C-terminal domain of a key clock protein PER2 (PER2c) plays a critically important role in the loop, not only for its interaction with the binding partner CRY proteins but also for the CRY/PER complex's translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. Previous circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic studies have shown that mouse PER2c (mPER2c) is less structured in solution by itself but folded into stable secondary structures upon interaction with mouse CRYs. To understand the stability and folding of human PER2c (hPER2c), we expressed and purified hPER2c. Three oligomerization forms of recombinant hPER2c were identified and thoroughly characterized through a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques. Different to mPER2c, both thermal unfolding DLS and CD analyses suggested that all forms of hPER2c have very stable secondary structures in solution by themselves with melting temperatures higher than the physiological body temperature, indicating that hPER2c does not require CRY to fold. Furthermore, we examined the effects of EDTA, salt concentration, and a reducing agent on hPER2c folding and oligomerization. The ability of hPER2c forming oligomers reflects the potential role of hPER2c in the assembly of circadian rhythm core protein complexes."
