https://openalex.org/W3122693272,"Despite immense advances in the field of topological materials, the antiferromagnetic topological insulator (AFMTI) state, predicted in 2010, has been resisting experimental observation up to now. Here, using density functional theory and Monte Carlo method we predict and by means of structural, transport, magnetic, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements confirm for the first time realization of the AFMTI phase, that is hosted by the van der Waals layered compound MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. An interlayer AFM ordering makes MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ invariant with respect to the combination of the time-reversal ($\Theta$) and primitive-lattice translation ($T_{1/2}$) symmetries, $S=\Theta T_{1/2}$, which gives rise to the $Z_2$ topological classification of AFM insulators, $Z_2$ being equal to 1 for this material. The $S$-breaking (0001) surface of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ features a giant bandgap in the topological surface state thus representing an ideal platform for the observation of such long-sought phenomena as the quantized magnetoelectric coupling and intrinsic axion insulator state."
https://openalex.org/W2995147378,"Metastasis requires cancer cells to undergo metabolic changes that are poorly understood1-3. Here we show that metabolic differences among melanoma cells confer differences in metastatic potential as a result of differences in the function of the MCT1 transporter. In vivo isotope tracing analysis in patient-derived xenografts revealed differences in nutrient handling between efficiently and inefficiently metastasizing melanomas, with circulating lactate being a more prominent source of tumour lactate in efficient metastasizers. Efficient metastasizers had higher levels of MCT1, and inhibition of MCT1 reduced lactate uptake. MCT1 inhibition had little effect on the growth of primary subcutaneous tumours, but resulted in depletion of circulating melanoma cells and reduced the metastatic disease burden in patient-derived xenografts and in mouse melanomas. In addition, inhibition of MCT1 suppressed the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Antioxidants blocked the effects of MCT1 inhibition on metastasis. MCT1high and MCT1-/low cells from the same melanomas had similar capacities to form subcutaneous tumours, but MCT1high cells formed more metastases after intravenous injection. Metabolic differences among cancer cells thus confer differences in metastatic potential as metastasizing cells depend on MCT1 to manage oxidative stress."

https://openalex.org/W2995259736,"Water lilies belong to the angiosperm order Nymphaeales. Amborellales, Nymphaeales and Austrobaileyales together form the so-called ANA-grade of angiosperms, which are extant representatives of lineages that diverged the earliest from the lineage leading to the extant mesangiosperms1-3. Here we report the 409-megabase genome sequence of the blue-petal water lily (Nymphaea colorata). Our phylogenomic analyses support Amborellales and Nymphaeales as successive sister lineages to all other extant angiosperms. The N. colorata genome and 19 other water lily transcriptomes reveal a Nymphaealean whole-genome duplication event, which is shared by Nymphaeaceae and possibly Cabombaceae. Among the genes retained from this whole-genome duplication are homologues of genes that regulate flowering transition and flower development. The broad expression of homologues of floral ABCE genes in N. colorata might support a similarly broadly active ancestral ABCE model of floral organ determination in early angiosperms. Water lilies have evolved attractive floral scents and colours, which are features shared with mesangiosperms, and we identified their putative biosynthetic genes in N. colorata. The chemical compounds and biosynthetic genes behind floral scents suggest that they have evolved in parallel to those in mesangiosperms. Because of its unique phylogenetic position, the N. colorata genome sheds light on the early evolution of angiosperms."
https://openalex.org/W2896456462,"Magnetically doped topological insulators enable the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) which provides quantized edge states for lossless charge transport applications. The edge states are hosted by a magnetic energy gap at the Dirac point but all attempts to observe it directly have been unsuccessful. The gap size is considered crucial to overcoming the present limitations of the QAHE, which so far occurs only at temperatures one to two orders of magnitude below its principle limit set by the ferromagnetic Curie temperature $T_C$. Here, we use low temperature photoelectron spectroscopy to unambiguously reveal the magnetic gap of Mn-doped Bi$_2$Te$_3$ films, which is present only below $T_C$. Surprisingly, the gap turns out to be $\sim$90 meV wide, which not only exceeds $k_BT$ at room temperature but is also 5 times larger than predicted by density functional theory. By an exhaustive multiscale structure characterization we show that this enhancement is due to a remarkable structure modification induced by Mn doping. Instead of a disordered impurity system, it forms an alternating sequence of septuple and quintuple layer blocks, where Mn is predominantly incorporated in the septuple layers. This self-organized heterostructure substantially enhances the wave-function overlap and the size of the magnetic gap at the Dirac point, as recently predicted. Mn-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ forms a similar heterostructure, however, only a large, nonmagnetic gap is formed. We explain both differences based on the higher spin-orbit interaction in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ with the most important consequence of a magnetic anisotropy perpendicular to the films, whereas for Bi$_2$Se$_3$ the spin-orbit interaction it is too weak to overcome the dipole-dipole interaction. Our findings provide crucial insights for pushing the lossless transport properties of topological insulators towards room-temperature applications."

https://openalex.org/W2994831876,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful method for determining the structure of molecules and proteins. While conventional NMR requires averaging over large ensembles, recent progress with single-spin quantum sensors has created the prospect of magnetic imaging of individual molecules. As an initial step towards this goal, isolated nuclear spins and spin pairs have been mapped. However, large clusters of interacting spins - such as found in molecules - result in highly complex spectra. Imaging these complex systems is an outstanding challenge due to the required high spectral resolution and efficient spatial reconstruction with sub-angstrom precision. Here we develop such atomic-scale imaging using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre as a quantum sensor, and demonstrate it on a model system of $27$ coupled $^{13}$C nuclear spins in a diamond. We present a new multidimensional spectroscopy method that isolates individual nuclear-nuclear spin interactions with high spectral resolution ($< 80\,$mHz) and high accuracy ($2$ mHz). We show that these interactions encode the composition and inter-connectivity of the cluster, and develop methods to extract the 3D structure of the cluster with sub-angstrom resolution. Our results demonstrate a key capability towards magnetic imaging of individual molecules and other complex spin systems."
https://openalex.org/W2995515129,"A subset of children with autism spectrum disorder appear to show an improvement in their behavioural symptoms during the course of a fever, a sign of systemic inflammation1,2. Here we elucidate the molecular and neural mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects of inflammation on social behaviour deficits in mice. We compared an environmental model of neurodevelopmental disorders in which mice were exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA) during embryogenesis3,4 with mouse models that are genetically deficient for contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Cntnap2)5, fragile X mental retardation-1 (Fmr1)6 or Sh3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (Shank3)7. We establish that the social behaviour deficits in offspring exposed to MIA can be temporarily rescued by the inflammatory response elicited by the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This behavioural rescue was accompanied by a reduction in neuronal activity in the primary somatosensory cortex dysgranular zone (S1DZ), the hyperactivity of which was previously implicated in the manifestation of behavioural phenotypes associated with offspring exposed to MIA8. By contrast, we did not observe an LPS-induced rescue of social deficits in the monogenic models. We demonstrate that the differences in responsiveness to the LPS treatment between the MIA and the monogenic models emerge from differences in the levels of cytokine production. LPS treatment in monogenic mutant mice did not induce amounts of interleukin-17a (IL-17a) comparable to those induced in MIA offspring; bypassing this difference by directly delivering IL-17a into S1DZ was sufficient to promote sociability in monogenic mutant mice as well as in MIA offspring. Conversely, abrogating the expression of IL-17 receptor subunit a (IL-17Ra) in the neurons of the S1DZ eliminated the ability of LPS to reverse the sociability phenotypes in MIA offspring. Our data support a neuroimmune mechanism that underlies neurodevelopmental disorders in which the production of IL-17a during inflammation can ameliorate the expression of social behaviour deficits by directly affecting neuronal activity in the central nervous system. IL-17a induced by immune activation affects cortical neural activity and promotes social interaction in a mouse model of neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2996372803,"Chronic inflammation is accompanied by recurring cycles of tissue destruction and repair and is associated with an increased risk of cancer1-3. However, how such cycles affect the clonal composition of tissues, particularly in terms of cancer development, remains unknown. Here we show that in patients with ulcerative colitis, the inflamed intestine undergoes widespread remodelling by pervasive clones, many of which are positively selected by acquiring mutations that commonly involve the NFKBIZ, TRAF3IP2, ZC3H12A, PIGR and HNRNPF genes and are implicated in the downregulation of IL-17 and other pro-inflammatory signals. Mutational profiles vary substantially between colitis-associated cancer and non-dysplastic tissues in ulcerative colitis, which indicates that there are distinct mechanisms of positive selection in both tissues. In particular, mutations in NFKBIZ are highly prevalent in the epithelium of patients with ulcerative colitis but rarely found in both sporadic and colitis-associated cancer, indicating that NFKBIZ-mutant cells are selected against during colorectal carcinogenesis. In further support of this negative selection, we found that tumour formation was significantly attenuated in Nfkbiz-mutant mice and cell competition was compromised by disruption of NFKBIZ in human colorectal cancer cells. Our results highlight common and discrete mechanisms of clonal selection in inflammatory tissues, which reveal unexpected cancer vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited for therapeutics in colorectal cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2996195908,"Bacteria use adaptive immune systems encoded by CRISPR and Cas genes to maintain genomic integrity when challenged by pathogens and mobile genetic elements1-3. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems typically target foreign DNA for degradation via joint action of the ribonucleoprotein complex Cascade and the helicase-nuclease Cas34,5, but nuclease-deficient type I systems lacking Cas3 have been repurposed for RNA-guided transposition by bacterial Tn7-like transposons6,7. How CRISPR- and transposon-associated machineries collaborate during DNA targeting and insertion remains unknown. Here we describe structures of a TniQ-Cascade complex encoded by the Vibrio cholerae Tn6677 transposon using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing the mechanistic basis of this functional coupling. The cryo-electron microscopy maps enabled de novo modelling and refinement of the transposition protein TniQ, which binds to the Cascade complex as a dimer in a head-to-tail configuration, at the interface formed by Cas6 and Cas7 near the 3' end of the CRISPR RNA (crRNA). The natural Cas8-Cas5 fusion protein binds the 5' crRNA handle and contacts the TniQ dimer via a flexible insertion domain. A target DNA-bound structure reveals critical interactions necessary for protospacer-adjacent motif recognition and R-loop formation. This work lays the foundation for a structural understanding of how DNA targeting by TniQ-Cascade leads to downstream recruitment of additional transposase proteins, and will guide protein engineering efforts to leverage this system for programmable DNA insertions in genome-engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W2995571829,"Modifications of histone proteins have essential roles in normal development and human disease. Recognition of modified histones by ‘reader’ proteins is a key mechanism that mediates the function of histone modifications, but how the dysregulation of these readers might contribute to disease remains poorly understood. We previously identified the ENL protein as a reader of histone acetylation via its YEATS domain, linking it to the expression of cancer-driving genes in acute leukaemia1. Recurrent hotspot mutations have been found in the ENL YEATS domain in Wilms tumour2,3, the most common type of paediatric kidney cancer. Here we show, using human and mouse cells, that these mutations impair cell-fate regulation by conferring gain-of-function in chromatin recruitment and transcriptional control. ENL mutants induce gene-expression changes that favour a premalignant cell fate, and, in an assay for nephrogenesis using murine cells, result in undifferentiated structures resembling those observed in human Wilms tumour. Mechanistically, although bound to largely similar genomic loci as the wild-type protein, ENL mutants exhibit increased occupancy at a subset of targets, leading to a marked increase in the recruitment and activity of transcription elongation machinery that enforces active transcription from target loci. Furthermore, ectopically expressed ENL mutants exhibit greater self-association and form discrete and dynamic nuclear puncta that are characteristic of biomolecular hubs consisting of local high concentrations of regulatory factors. Such mutation-driven ENL self-association is functionally linked to enhanced chromatin occupancy and gene activation. Collectively, our findings show that hotspot mutations in a chromatin-reader domain drive self-reinforced recruitment, derailing normal cell-fate control during development and leading to an oncogenic outcome. The histone-acetylation-reader protein ENL is mutated in a paediatric kidney cancer in such a way that it clusters at target genes, increasing the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery, enhancing transcription and deregulating cell fate during development."
https://openalex.org/W2994774314,"Predator-prey cycles rank among the most fundamental concepts in ecology, are predicted by the simplest ecological models and enable, theoretically, the indefinite persistence of predator and prey1-4. However, it remains an open question for how long cyclic dynamics can be self-sustained in real communities. Field observations have been restricted to a few cycle periods5-8 and experimental studies indicate that oscillations may be short-lived without external stabilizing factors9-19. Here we performed microcosm experiments with a planktonic predator-prey system and repeatedly observed oscillatory time series of unprecedented length that persisted for up to around 50 cycles or approximately 300 predator generations. The dominant type of dynamics was characterized by regular, coherent oscillations with a nearly constant predator-prey phase difference. Despite constant experimental conditions, we also observed shorter episodes of irregular, non-coherent oscillations without any significant phase relationship. However, the predator-prey system showed a strong tendency to return to the dominant dynamical regime with a defined phase relationship. A mathematical model suggests that stochasticity is probably responsible for the reversible shift from coherent to non-coherent oscillations, a notion that was supported by experiments with external forcing by pulsed nutrient supply. Our findings empirically demonstrate the potential for infinite persistence of predator and prey populations in a cyclic dynamic regime that shows resilience in the presence of stochastic events."

https://openalex.org/W3099810174,"The three-body problem is arguably the oldest open question in astrophysics and has resisted a general analytic solution for centuries. Various implementations of perturbation theory provide solutions in portions of parameter space, but only where hierarchies of masses or separations exist. Numerical integrations1 show that bound, non-hierarchical triple systems of Newtonian point particles will almost2 always disintegrate into a single escaping star and a stable bound binary3,4, but the chaotic nature of the three-body problem5 prevents the derivation of tractable6 analytic formulae that deterministically map initial conditions to final outcomes. Chaos, however, also motivates the assumption of ergodicity7–9, implying that the distribution of outcomes is uniform across the accessible phase volume. Here we report a statistical solution to the non-hierarchical three-body problem that is derived using the ergodic hypothesis and that provides closed-form distributions of outcomes (for example, binary orbital elements) when given the conserved integrals of motion. We compare our outcome distributions to large ensembles of numerical three-body integrations and find good agreement, so long as we restrict ourselves to ‘resonant’ encounters10 (the roughly 50 per cent of scatterings that undergo chaotic evolution). In analysing our scattering experiments, we identify ‘scrambles’ (periods of time in which no pairwise binaries exist) as the key dynamical state that ergodicizes a non-hierarchical triple system. The generally super-thermal distributions of survivor binary eccentricity that we predict have notable applications to many astrophysical scenarios. For example, non-hierarchical triple systems produced dynamically in globular clusters are a primary formation channel for black-hole mergers11–13, but the rates and properties14,15 of the resulting gravitational waves depend on the distribution of post-disintegration eccentricities. The ergodic hypothesis is used to produce a statistical solution to the chaotic non-hierarchical three-body problem."
https://openalex.org/W2996665143,"Many environmental stresses cause osmotic stress which induces several metabolic changes in plants. These changes often vary depending on the genotype, type and intensity of stress or the environmental conditions. In the current experiments, metabolic responses of wheat to osmotic stress induced by different kinds of osmolytes were studied under iso-osmotic stress conditions. A single wheat genotypes was treated with PEG-6000, mannitol, sorbitol or NaCl at such concentrations which reduce the osmotic potential of the culture media to the same level (-0.8MPa). The metabolic changes, including the accumulation of proline, glycine betaine (GB) and sugar metabolites (glucose, fructose, galactose, maltose and sucrose) were studied both in the leaves and roots together with monitoring the plant growth, changes in the photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll content of the leaves. In addition, the polyamine metabolism was also investigated. Although all osmolytes inhibited growth similarly, they induced different physiological and metabolic responses: the CO2 assimilation capacity, RWC content and the osmotic potential (ψπ) of the leaves decreased intensively, especially after mannitol and sorbitol treatments, followed by NaCl treatment, while PEG caused only a slight modification in these parameters. In the roots, the most pronounced decrease of ψπ was found after salt-treatments, followed by PEG treatment. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of proline, glycine betaine and soluble sugars, such as fructose, glucose, sucrose and galactose in both the root and leaf sap. Specific metabolic response of roots and leaves under PEG included accumulation of glucose, fructose and GB (in the roots); sucrose, galactose and proline synthesis were dominant under NaCl stress while exposure to mannitol and sorbitol triggered polyamine metabolism and overproduction of maltose. The amount of those metabolites was time-dependent in the manner that longer exposure to iso-osmotic stress conditions stimulated the sugar metabolic routes. Our results showed that the various osmolytes activated different metabolic processes even under iso-osmotic stress conditions and these changes also differed in the leaves and roots."

We sought to determine if plasma biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation, endothelial activation, and blood brain barrier (BBB) injury were associated with emergency department (ED) delirium duration. Methods We enrolled hospitalized patients who were 65 years or older from the ED. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-8, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I [sTNFRI]), coagulation (Protein C), endothelial activation (plasminogen activating inhibitor-1 [PAI-1]), and BBB injury (S100B) at were measured using blood obtained at enrollment. The dependent variable was ED delirium duration which was determined by the Brief Confusion Assessment Method assessed in the ED and hospitalization. Proportional odds logistic regression analyses were performed adjusted for relevant confounders and allowing for interaction by baseline dementia status. Results A total of 156 patients were enrolled. IL-6 (POR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.09-2.32) and PAI-1 (POR = 2.96, 95%CI: 1.48 to 6.85) were independently associated with more prominent ED delirium duration in subjects without dementia only. No significant associations between IL-8, Protein C, sTNRFI, and S100B and ED delirium duration were observed. Conclusions Plasma Biomarkers of systemic inflammation and endothelial activation are associated with ED delirium duration in older ED patients without dementia."

https://openalex.org/W2995291711,"With few exceptions1-3, polydispersity or molecular heterogeneity in matter tends to impede self-assembly and state transformation. For example, shape transformations of liquid droplets with monodisperse ingredients have been reported in equilibrium4-7 and non-equilibrium studies8,9, and these transition phenomena were understood on the basis of homogeneous material responses. Here, by contrast, we study equilibrium suspensions of drops composed of polydisperse nematic liquid crystal oligomers (NLCOs). Surprisingly, molecular heterogeneity in the polydisperse drops promotes reversible shape transitions to a rich variety of non-spherical morphologies with unique internal structure. We find that variation of oligomer chain length distribution, temperature, and surfactant concentration alters the balance between NLCO elastic energy and interfacial energy, and drives formation of nematic structures that range from roughened spheres to 'flower' shapes to branched filamentous networks with controllable diameters. The branched structures with confined liquid crystal director fields can be produced reversibly over areas of at least one square centimetre and can be converted into liquid crystal elastomers by ultraviolet curing. Observations and modelling reveal that chain length polydispersity plays a crucial role in driving these morphogenic phenomena, via spatial segregation. This insight suggests new routes for encoding network structure and function in soft materials."
https://openalex.org/W2996560206,"The NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is one of the best-characterized inflammasomes in humans and other mammals. However, knowledge about the NLRP3 inflammasome in nonmammalian species remains limited. Here, we report the molecular and functional identification of an NLRP3 homolog ( Dr NLRP3) in a zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) model. We found that Dr NLRP3's overall structural architecture was shared with mammalian NLRP3s. It initiates a classical inflammasome assembly for zebrafish inflammatory caspase ( Dr Caspase-A/-B) activation and interleukin 1β ( Dr IL-1β) maturation in an apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC)-dependent manner, in which Dr NLRP3 organizes Dr ASC into a filament that recruits Dr Caspase-A/-B by homotypic pyrin domain (PYD)–PYD interactions. Dr Caspase-A/-B activation in the Dr NLRP3 inflammasome occurred in two steps, with Dr Caspase-A being activated first and Dr Caspase-B second. Dr NLRP3 also directly activated full-length Dr Caspase-B and elicited cell pyroptosis in a gasdermin E (GSDME)-dependent but ASC-independent manner. These two events were tightly coordinated by Dr NLRP3 to ensure efficient IL-1β secretion for the initiation of host innate immunity. By knocking down Dr NLRP3 in zebrafish embryos and generating a Dr ASC-knockout ( Dr ASC −/− ) fish clone, we characterized the function of the Dr NLRP3 inflammasome in anti-bacterial immunity in vivo . The results of our study disclosed the origin of the NLRP3 inflammasome in teleost fish, providing a cross-species understanding of the evolutionary history of inflammasomes. Our findings also indicate that the NLRP3 inflammasome may coordinate inflammatory cytokine processing and secretion through a GSDME-mediated pyroptotic pathway, uncovering a previously unrecognized regulatory function of NLRP3 in both inflammation and cell pyroptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2994772832,"Rib fractures represent the most common bone fracture, occurring in 10–20% of all blunt trauma patients and leading to concomitant injuries of the inner organs in severe cases. The purpose of this study was to identify specific serial rib fracture patterns after blunt chest trauma. 380 serial rib fracture cases were investigated. Fractures were assigned to five different locations within the transverse plane. Rib level, fracture type, and dislocation grades were recorded and related to the cause of accident. In total, 3735 rib fractures were identified (9.8 per patient). 54% of the rib fractures were detected on the left thorax. Rib fracture distribution exhibited a hotspot at rib levels 4 to 7 in the lateral and posterolateral segments. On average, most rib fractures occurred in crush/burying injuries (15.8, n = 13) and pedestrian accidents (12.8, n = 13), least in car/truck accidents (8.9, n = 75). In the car/truck accident group, 47% of all rib fractures were in the lateral segment, in case of frontal collision (n = 24) even 60%. Fall injuries (n = 141) entailed mostly posterolateral rib fractures (35%). In case of falls >3 m (n = 45), 48% more rib fractures were detected on the left thorax. In cardiopulmonary resuscitation related serial rib fractures (n = 33), 70% of all rib fractures were located anterolaterally. Infractions were the most observed fracture type (44%), followed by oblique (25%) and transverse (18%) fractures, while 46% of all rib fractures were dislocated (15% ≥ rib width). Serial rib fractures showed distinct fracture patterns depending on the cause of accident. When developing a serial rib fracture classification system, data regarding patterns, fracture types, dislocation grades, and associated fractures should be included."
https://openalex.org/W2995383599,"Metal to insulator transitions (MITs) driven by strong electronic correlations are common in condensed matter systems, and are associated with some of the most remarkable collective phenomena in solids, including superconductivity and magnetism. Tuning and control of the transition holds the promise of novel, low power, ultrafast electronics, but the relative roles of doping, chemistry, elastic strain and other applied fields has made systematic understanding difficult to obtain. Here we point out that existing data on tuning of the MIT in perovskite transition metal oxides through ionic size effects provides evidence of systematic and large effects on the phase transition due to dynamical fluctuations of the elastic strain, which have been usually neglected. This is illustrated by a simple yet quantitative statistical mechanical calculation in a model that incorporates cooperative lattice distortions coupled to the electronic degrees of freedom. We reproduce the observed dependence of the transition temperature on cation radius in the well-studied manganite and nickelate materials. Since the elastic couplings are generically quite strong, these conclusions will broadly generalize to all MITs that couple to a change in lattice symmetry."

https://openalex.org/W2995918392,"Background Nigerian gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, with an estimated prevalence of between 11–35%. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to significantly decrease incident HIV infections among Nigerian GBMSM. Understanding the relationship between socio-demographic, sexual risk behavior, and psychosocial factors with PrEP awareness, willingness to use, and history of use among this group is pivotal to maximizing PrEP uptake. Methods Between March and June 2019, 419 participants completed an interviewer-administered survey assessing PrEP awareness, willingness to use, and history of use; socio-demographics; sexual risk behavior; and psychosocial factors. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine factors associated with PrEP awareness, willingness to use, and history of use. Results 53.6% were aware of PrEP; 80.1% were willing to use PrEP; and 29.7% had previously used PrEP. In multivariable analysis, factors associated with an increased odds of PrEP awareness include residing in Abuja [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.13 to 11.83] and Lagos (aOR 12.30; 95% CI: 4.92 to 30.67) vs. residing in Plateau, living with HIV (aOR 2.56; 95% CI: 1.54 to 4.72), using location-based apps for seeking sexual partners (aOR 4.06; 95% CI: 2.28 to 7.24), having health insurance (aOR 2.31; 95% CI: 1.08 to 4.40), history of suicidal thoughts (aOR 2.05; 95% CI: 1.02 to 4.10), and history of PrEP use (aOR 45.5; 95% CI: 5.60 to 370.04). Decreasing clinically significant depressive symptoms was associated with lower willingness to use PrEP (aOR 0.96; 95% CI: 0.92 to 0.99). Lastly, factors associated with increased odds of having a history of PrEP use were those reporting 6 or more insertive anal sex acts in the last 30 days compared to those with none (aOR 5.76; 95% CI: 1.58 to 20.98) and being aware of PrEP (aOR 29.6; 95% CI: 3.78 to 231.84). Discussion Nearly half of the Nigerian GBMSM in this study had no prior awareness of PrEP, but after being informed about its potential benefits, the majority were willing to use it. However, PrEP uptake among Nigerian GBMSM remains low. Findings suggest that educational messages are necessary to ensure appropriate PrEP scale-up, especially tailored towards Nigerian GBMSM."

The analysis of a new miniature Characidae species of the genus Tyttobrycon, described herein, yielded to the discovery of a sexually dimorphic trait related to nostril aperture and number of olfactory lamellae. In this type of dimorphism, mature males present larger nostril aperture and higher number of olfactory lamella than females. A dimorphic olfactory organ is for the first time recorded and described for a member of the Characiformes. Gross morphology and development of brain and peripheral olfactory organ of Tyttobrycon sp. n. are described and compared to other species of Characidae. It is hypothesized that such dimorphic trait is related to male-male detection during cohort competition in small characids. The new species of Tyttobrycon is diagnosed from its congeners by the number of branched anal-fin rays (19–21) and the absence of a caudal-peduncle blotch.

We first developed a strategic plan with the objective to reduce maternal mortality by 50% in the hospital in two years. An MPDSR committee was established and the members and all staff of the Maternity Department of the hospital were trained to use the nationally approved protocol. All consecutive cases of maternal deaths in the hospital were then reviewed using the MPDSR protocol. The results were submitted to the hospital Management and its supporting agencies for administrative action to correct the identified deficiencies.There were 18 maternal deaths in the hospital during the period, and 4,557 deliveries giving a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 395/100,000 deliveries. This amounted to a seven-fold reduction in MMR in the hospital at the onset of the project. The main medical causes identified were obstetric hemorrhage (n = 10), pulmonary embolism (n = 2), ruptured uterus (n = 2), eclampsia (n = 1), anemic heart failure (n = 1) and post-partum sepsis (n = 2). Several facility-based and patient contributory factors were identified such as lack of blood in the hospital and late reporting with severe obstetric complication among others. Response to the recommendations from the committee include increased commitment of hospital managers to immediately rectify the attributable causes of deaths, the establishment of a couples health education program, mobilization and sensitization of staff to handle pregnant women with great sensitivity, promptness and care, the refurbishing of an intensive care unit, and the increased availability of blood for transfusion through the intensification of blood donation drive in the hospital.We conclude that the results of MPDSR, when acted upon by hospital managers and policymakers can lead to an improvement in quality of care and a consequent decline in maternal mortality ratio in referral hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W2996616404,"Alterations in thermal niches have been widely associated with the Anthropocene erosion of reptiles’ diversity. They entail potential physiological constraints for organisms’ performance, which can lead to activity restrictions and impact fitness and demography. Reptiles are ectotherms which rely on seasonal periodicity to maximize the performance of biological functions. Despite it, the ecological implications of shifts in local temperatures are barely explored at the seasonal scale. This study aims to assess how changes in air temperature and substrate temperature affect the activity, body temperature (Tb) and thermoregulation patterns of the sand lizard, Liolaemus arambarensis (an endangered, microendemic species from southern Brazil), throughout a four-year period. Field surveys were conducted monthly on a restricted population in a sand-dune habitat. The annual fluctuations of the seasonal temperatures led to significant changes in the activity and Tb of L. arambarensis and shaped thermoregulation trends, suggesting biological plasticity as a key factor in the face of such variability. Lizards tended to maintain seasonal Tb in mild and harsh seasons through increased warming/cooling efforts. Anomalous winter conditions seemed especially critical for individual performance due to their apparent high impact favouring/constraining activity. Activity and thermoregulation were inhibited in frigid winters, probably due to a vulnerable physiology to intense cold spells determined by higher preferred body temperatures than Tb. Our results warn of a complex sensitivity in lizards to anomalous seasonal temperatures, which are potentially enhanced by climate change. The current work highlights the importance of multiannual biomonitoring to disentangle long-term responses in the thermal biology of reptiles and, thereby, to integrate conservation needs in the scope of global change."
https://openalex.org/W2995596821,"Satellite DNAs are among the most abundant repetitive DNAs found in eukaryote genomes, where they participate in a variety of biological roles, from being components of important chromosome structures to gene regulation. Experimental methodologies used before the genomic era were insufficient, too laborious and time-consuming to recover the collection of all satDNAs from a genome. Today, the availability of whole sequenced genomes combined with the development of specific bioinformatic tools are expected to foster the identification of virtually all the “satellitome” of a particular species. While whole genome assemblies are important to obtain a global view of genome organization, most of them are incomplete and lack repetitive regions. We applied short-read sequencing and similarity clustering in order to perform a de novo identification of the most abundant satellite families in two Drosophila species from the virilis group: Drosophila virilis and D. americana, using the Tandem Repeat Analyzer (TAREAN) and RepeatExplorer pipelines. These species were chosen because they have been used as models to understand satDNA biology since the early 70’s. We combined the computational approach with data from the literature and chromosome mapping to obtain an overview of the major tandem repeat sequences of these species. The fact that all of the abundant tandem repeats (TRs) we detected were previously identified in the literature allowed us to evaluate the efficiency of TAREAN in correctly identifying true satDNAs. Our results indicate that raw sequencing reads can be efficiently used to detect satDNAs, but that abundant tandem repeats present in dispersed arrays or associated with transposable elements are frequent false positives. We demonstrate that TAREAN with its parent method RepeatExplorer may be used as resources to detect tandem repeats associated with transposable elements and also to reveal families of dispersed tandem repeats."

https://openalex.org/W2995916818,"Patient-specific therapies require that cells be manufactured in multiple batches of small volumes, making it a challenge for conventional modes of quality control. The added complexity of inherent variability (even within batches) necessitates constant monitoring to ensure comparable end products. Hence, it is critical that new non-destructive modalities of cell monitoring be developed. Here, we study, for the first time, the use of optical spectroscopy in the determination of cellular redox across cell confluencies by exploiting the autofluorescence properties of molecules found natively within cells. This was achieved through a simple retrofitting of a standard inverted fluorescence microscope with a spectrometer output and an appropriate fluorescence filter cube. Through spectral decomposition on the acquired autofluorescence spectra, we are able to further discern the relative contributions of the different molecules, namely flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). This is then quantifiable as redox ratios (RR) that represent the extent of oxidation to reduction based upon the optically measured quantities of FAD and NADH. Results show that RR decreases with increasing cell confluency, which we attribute to several inter-related cellular processes. We validated the relationship between RR, metabolism and cell confluency through bio-chemical and viability assays. Live-dead and DNA damage studies were further conducted to substantiate that our measurement process had negligible effects on the cells. In this study, we demonstrate that autofluorescence spectroscopy-derived RR can serve as a rapid, non-destructive and label-free surrogate to cell metabolism measurements. This was further used to establish a relationship between cell metabolism and cellular redox across cell confluencies, and could potentially be employed as an indicator of quality in cell therapy manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W2996639812,"Purpose To investigate the clinical utility of mono-exponential model diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) using two b-values compared to the bi- or stretched exponential model to differentiate biliary atresia (BA) from non-BA in pediatric liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods Patients who underwent liver MRI with DWI for suspected BA from November 2017 to September 2018 were retrospectively included and divided into BA and non-BA groups. Laboratory results including γ-glutamyl transferase (γGT) were compared between the two groups using the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher’s exact test. The hepatic apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 10 using ten b-values and ADC 2 using two b-values were obtained from the mono-exponential model. The slow diffusion coefficient (D), fast diffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) were obtained from the bi-exponential model. The distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC) and heterogeneity index (α) were measured from the stretched exponential model. Parameters were compared between the two groups using a linear mixed model and diagnostic performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Results For 12 patients in the BA and five patients in the non-BA group, the ADC 10 (median 0.985 ×10−3 mm2/s vs. 1.332 ×10−3 mm2/s, p = 0.008), ADC 2 (median 0.987 ×10−3 mm2/s vs. 1.335 ×10−3 mm2/s, p = 0.017), D* (median 33.2 ×10−3 mm2/s vs. 55.3 ×10−3 mm2/s, p = 0.021), f (median 13.4%, vs. 22.1%, p = 0.009), and DDC (median 0.889 ×10−3 mm2/s vs. 1.323 ×10−3 mm2/s, p = 0.009) values were lower and the γGT (median 368.0 IU/L vs. 93.5 IU/L, p = 0.02) and α (median 0.699 vs. 0.556, p = 0.023) values were higher in the BA group. The AUC values for γGT (AUC 0.867 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.616–0.984), ADC 10 (AUC 0.963, 95% CI 0.834–0.998), ADC 2 (AUC 0.925, 95% CI 0.781–0.987), f (AUC 0.850, 95% CI 0.686–0.949), and DDC (AUC 0.925, 95% CI 0.781–0.987) were not significantly different, except for the D* and α values. Conclusion Patients with BA had lower ADC 10, ADC 2, D*, f, and DDC values and higher γGT and α values than those in the non-BA group. The diagnostic performance of ADC 2 using only two b-values showed excellent diagnostic performance and was not significantly different from that of γGT, ADC 10, f, and DDC for diagnosing BA."

https://openalex.org/W2995808687,"Objectives To estimate the relationship between sleep quality and depression, among Han and Manchu ethnicities, in a rural Chinese population. Methods A sample of 8,888 adults was selected using a multistage cluster and random sampling method. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Depressive symptoms were assessed via the Center for Epidemiological Survey, Depression Scale (CES-D). Logistic regression was conducted to assess associations between sleep quality and depression. Results The prevalence of poor sleep quality and depression in the Manchus (20.74% and 22.65%) was significantly lower than that in the Hans (29.57% and 26.25%), respectively. Depressive participants had higher odds ratios of global and all sub PSQI elements than non-depressive participants, both among the Hans and the Manchus. Additive interactions were identified between depressive symptoms and ethnicity with global and four sub-PSQI elements, including subjective sleep quality, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunction. Conclusions The findings revealed that the prevalence of poor sleep quality and depression among the Hans was greater than among the Manchus. Depression was associated with higher odds of poor sleep quality."
https://openalex.org/W2996095403,"Hearing aids are the most common rehabilitation strategy for age-related hearing loss. However, 25% to 50% of older adults fitted with hearing aids do not wear them post-fitting. Hearing aid self-efficacy has been suggested as one of the key factors that may explain adherence to hearing aids in older adults. The primary aim of this study was to determine a possible association between educational level and hearing aid self-efficacy in older adult hearing aid users from a Latin American country (i.e., Chile). The secondary aim was to determine if in this sample of older adults, hearing aid self-efficacy predicted hearing aid adherence as previously suggested by other studies. The MARS-HA (Measure of Audiologic Rehabilitation Self-Efficacy for Hearing Aids) questionnaire was used to measure hearing aid self-efficacy. This questionnaire was initially adapted into Spanish (S-MARS-HA) using forward and backward translations by bilingual English-Spanish speakers. A sample of 252 older adults fitted with hearing aids at a public hospital in Santiago, Chile, was investigated. Educational level was measured as the number of years of formal education. Participants responded to the S-MARS-HA along with questions exploring social support, attitudes in using hearing aids, participation in social events, and vision and joint problems. Hearing aid adherence was investigated with the use of a question from the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids. All these procedures were conducted at the participants’ homes. Pure-tone average (PTA; 500–4000 Hz) in the fitted ear was obtained from the participants’ medical records. Univariate and multivariate regression models were constructed to investigate the association between educational level and hearing aid self-efficacy controlling for the covariates of interest (e.g., social support, attitudes in using hearing aids, PTA). The S-MARS-HA showed an adequate construct validity along with a good reliability. Results of the multivariate regression analyses showed that educational level significantly predicted hearing aid self-efficacy. Covariates significantly associated with this outcome included attitudes in using hearing aids and PTA in the fitted ear. Finally, a significant association between hearing aid self-efficacy and adherence to hearing aid use was observed. In conclusion, this study showed a significant association between educational level and hearing aid self-efficacy in older adults from a developing Latin American country. Thus, this variable should be considered when designing and delivering aural rehabilitation programs such as hearing aids to older adults, especially those from developing countries."

https://openalex.org/W2995203986,"Background Intoxications with alcohol and drugs are common in the Emergency Department. This study aimed to describe the occurrence and characteristics of intoxications (alcohol, Drugs of Abuse (DOA), pharmaceutical and chemical) presented to the Emergency Department and the health care costs of these intoxications. Methods This was a retrospective medical record study of all patients (≥ 16 years) who presented to the Emergency Department of an inner-city academic hospital in the Netherlands due to single or multiple intoxication(s) as the primary or secondary reason in the year 2016. An intoxication was reported as present if the attending physician described the intoxication in the patient’s medical record. Results A total of 783 patients were included, accounting for 3.2% of the adult Emergency Department population (age ≥ 16 year). In 30% more than one substance was used. Intoxications with alcohol, Drugs of Abuse and pharmaceuticals was reported in respectively 62%, 29% and 21% of the intoxicated patients. The mean costs per patient presenting with an intoxication to the Emergency Department was € 1,490. The mean costs per patient were highest for pharmaceutical intoxications (€ 2,980), followed by Drugs of Abuse (€ 1,140) and alcohol (€ 1,070). Conclusions Intoxications among patients aged 16 years and older are frequently seen at the Emergency Department and are frequently caused by multiple substances. Alcohol is the most common intoxication. Substantial healthcare costs are involved. Therefore, this study suggests that further research into hazardous alcohol consumption and DOA abuse is warranted."

Due to its high similarity in three-dimensional structure with human cathepsins and their sequence identity above 70% in the active site regions, identifying potent but selective cruzain inhibitors with low side effects on the host organism represents a significant challenge. Here a panel of nitrile ligands with varying potencies against cathepsin K, cathepsin L and cruzain, are studied by molecular dynamics simulations as both non-covalent and covalent complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2996716285,"Background Preventive chemotherapy was administered to 3.2 million Sierra Leoneans in 13 health districts for lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and soil transmitted helminthes from October 2008 to February 2009. This paper aims to report the findings of a coverage survey conducted in 2009, compare the coverage survey findings with two reported rates for lymphatic filariasis coverage obtained using pre-mass drug administration (MDA) registration and national census projections, and use the comparison to understand the best source of population estimates in calculating coverage for NTD programming in Sierra Leone. Methodology/Principal findings Community drug distributors (CDDs) conducted a pre- MDA registration of the population. Two coverage rates for MDA for lymphatic filariasis were subsequently calculated using the reported number treated divided by the total population from: 1) the pre-MDA register and 2) national census projections. A survey was conducted to validate reported coverage data. 11,602 persons participated (response rate of 76.8%). Overall, reported coverage data aggregated to the national level were not significantly different from surveyed coverage (z-test >0.05). However, estimates based on pre-MDA registration have higher agreement with surveyed coverage (mean Kendall’s W = 0.68) than coverage calculated with census data (mean Kendall’s = 0.59), especially in districts with known large-scale migration, except in a highly urban district where it was more challenging to conduct a pre-MDA registration appropriately. There was no significant difference between coverage among males versus females when the analyses were performed excluding those women who were pregnant at the time of MDA. The surveyed coverage estimate was near or below the minimum 65% epidemiological coverage target for lymphatic filariasis MDA in all districts. Conclusion/Significance These results from Sierra Leone illustrate the importance of choosing the right denominator for calculating treatment coverage for NTD programs. While routinely reported coverage results using national census data are often good enough for programmatic decision making, census projections can quickly become outdated where there is substantial migration, e.g. due to the impact of civil war, with changing economic opportunities, in urban settings, and where there are large migratory populations. In districts where this is known to be the case, well implemented pre-MDA registration can provide better population estimates. Pre-MDA registration should, however, be implemented correctly to reduce the risk of missing pockets of the population, especially in urban settings."
https://openalex.org/W2994811860,"Sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) determines the equilibrium between free and protein-bound androgens and estrogens in the blood and regulates their access to target tissues. Using crystallographic approaches and radiolabeled competitive binding-capacity assays, we report here how two nonsteroidal compounds bind to human SHBG, and how they influence androgen activity in cell culture. We found that one of these compounds, (−)3,4-divanillyltetrahydrofuran (DVT), present in stinging nettle root extracts and used as a nutraceutical, binds SHBG with relatively low affinity. By contrast, a synthetic compound, 3-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-2phenyl-1H-indole (IPI), bound SHBG with an affinity similar to that of testosterone and estradiol. Crystal structures of SHBG in complex with DVT or IPI at 1.71–1.80 Å resolutions revealed their unique orientations in the SHBG ligand-binding pocket and suggested opportunities for the design of other nonsteroidal ligands of SHBG. As observed for estradiol but not testosterone, IPI binding to SHBG was reduced by ∼20-fold in the presence of zinc, whereas DVT binding was almost completely lost. Estradiol-dependent fibulin-2 interactions with SHBG similarly occurred for IPI-bound SHBG, but not with DVT-bound SHBG. Both DVT and IPI increased the activity of testosterone in a cell culture androgen reporter system by competitively displacing testosterone from SHBG. These findings indicate how nonsteroidal ligands of SHBG maybe designed to modulate the bioavailability of sex steroids."
https://openalex.org/W2996247185,"The Gorumara National Park (GNP) is an important conservation area located in the northern region of West Bengal State, India, as it provides habitat for three megaherbivores: Indian One-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and Gaurs (Bos gaurus). It harbours one of the last population of the one-horned rhino. In the present study, landscape change and configuration were investigated by comparing three Landsat images, from 1998, 2008 and 2018. The images were classified into six different landcover classes following standard methodology. The present study also involves evaluation of landscape and anthropogenic predictors influence on the megaherbivores of GNP, followed by future landcover simulation for the year 2028. The result shows a significant decrease in the grassland cover from 18.87 km2 to 8.27 km2 from 1998 to 2018, whereas the woodland cover has increased from 50.14 km2 to 62.09 km2 between 1998 and 2018. The landscape configuration indices such as Number of Patches (NP), Patch Density (PD), Interspersion and Juxtaposition (IJI), Aggregation Index (AI) and Mean Shape Index (SHAPE AM) indicated that the landscapes has lost complexity in the spatial placement of patches of different Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes. Also, the landscape over the three decades has become uniform in terms of diversity of patches, because of earlier plantation activities by the forest managers. Result also indicated that grassland, along with its class metrics are the top predictors contributing 43.6% in explaining the spatial distribution of megaherbivores in GNP. Results from the simulated landcover of 2028 suggest a possible decline in overall grassland by 6.23% and a subsequent upsurge in woodland by 6.09% from 2018. The present result will be useful in guiding the forest management in developing habitat improvement strategies for the long- term viability of megaherbivore populations of rhino, gaur and elephant in the GNP."
https://openalex.org/W2995828811,"The purpose of this investigation was to compare the antitumorigenic effects of the natural product Nexrutine to voluntary wheel running (VWR) in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. Forty-five, 10-week old TRAMP mice were randomized to either receive free access to the running wheel, Nexrutine pelleted into chow at 600 mg/kg or no treatment control. Mice were serially sacrificed at weeks 4, 8,12 and 20 weeks. Palpable tumors, body weight, food consumption and running wheel activity were monitored weekly. At necropsy, tumors and serum were harvested and stored for analysis. Serum was used to quantify circulating cytokines in 4 and 20 week time points. Nexrutine supplementation led to a 66% protection against high grade tumors. Exercise resulted in a 60% protection against high grade tumors. Both interventions reduced concentrations of IL-1α. Exercise also significantly lowered concentrations of eotaxin, IL-5, IL-12(p40) and VEGF. While there were no significant differences at baseline, exercise mice had significantly lower IL-5 and VEGF compared to control at the 20 week time point. Nexrutine also significantly reduced circulating IL-9 concentrations. No significant differences were observed when compared to the control group. Immunohistochemistry of tumor sections showed significantly lower expression of pAkt in Nexrutine fed mice with no visible differences for NFκB. In conclusion, both Nexrutine and exercise suppressed tumor growth. Though similar outcomes were seen in this comparative effectiveness study, the mechanisms by which exercise and Nexrutine exert this benefit may focus on different pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2996547229,"Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are more likely than siblings to report low sperm count and to use assisted reproductive technologies. Yet, it is still unclear if the sperm produced many years after remission of cancer display DNA and chromatin damage linked to male infertility and poor embryo development. As well, the importance of the age at diagnosis in relation to puberty is poorly understood. In this pilot study, we compared reproductive parameters and sperm damage from adult survivors of childhood leukemia and lymphoma, sub-divided into those diagnosed before or after puberty, to men with no history of cancer. Our data indicate that CCS, independently of the age of diagnosis, have a high risk of low sperm count and when sperm are present, chances of DNA and chromatin abnormalities appear similar to those seen in the general population. Exposure to alkylating agents is correlated with low sperm count whereas exposure to anthracyclines, and doxorubicin in particular, could have long-term consequences on sperm integrity. This study highlights the need for further research on fertility among male CCS and the importance of informing families about the potential long-term impact of chemotherapy on male fertility regardless of age at diagnosis."

https://openalex.org/W2996710609,"Fluorescent labeling of specific cell-surface proteins enables a manifold of techniques to study their function in health and disease. A frequently cited family of methods employs phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) to attach probes, provided as conjugates of Coenzyme A. This method appears attractive, as only short peptide tags genetically fused to the protein of interest are needed as conjugation sites. Here, we describe observations we made when evaluating such protocols for delicate single-molecule applications where we require a particular combination of dyes, low background binding or low labeling of other proteins, and a high degree of labeling.When we tested a PPTase-acceptor peptide couple with several experimental protocols and various CoA conjugates for labeling of a protein on the cell surface, we noticed substantial non-specific labeling. For the first time, we provide here a quantification of the non-specific fraction of the signals obtained using appropriate controls. We further present evidence that this background is due to CoA-dye conjugates entering the cell, where they may be covalently attached to endogenous proteins. However, when studying cell-surface proteins, most fluorescent readouts require that labeling is strictly limited to the protein of interest located at the cell surface. While such data have so far been missing in the literature, they suggest that for applications where labeling of unwanted molecules would affect the conclusions, researchers need to be aware of this potential non-specificity of PPTase methods when selecting a labeling strategy. We show, again by quantitative comparison, that the HaloTag is a viable alternative."
https://openalex.org/W2994793929,"Objective Studies have found an association between child behavioural problems and overweight, but the existing evidence for this relationship is inconsistent, and results from longitudinal studies are sparse. Thus, we examined the association between behavioural problems and subsequent changes in body mass index (BMI) and anthropometry over a follow-up period of 1.3 years among children aged 2–6 years. Design The study was based on a total of 345 children from The Healthy Start Study; all children were healthy weight but predisposed to develop overweight. The Danish version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), classified as SDQ Total Difficulties (SDQ-TD) and SDQ Prosocial Behaviour (SDQ-PSB), was used to assess child behaviour. Linear regression analyses were used to examine associations between SDQ scores and subsequent change in BMI z-score, body fat percentage, waist circumference and waist-hip ratio, while taking possible confounding factors into account. Results We found an association between SDQ-PSB and subsequent change in BMI z-score (β: 0.040 [95% CI: 0.010; 0.071, p = 0.009]). However, there was no evidence of an association between SDQ-PSB and measures of body composition or body shape. Conclusions Among 2 to 6 years old children predisposed to overweight, the association between SDQ-scores and weight gain is either absent or marginal. The SDQ-PSB score may be associated with subsequent increases in BMI z-score, but this association does not seem driven by an increased relative fat accumulation."
