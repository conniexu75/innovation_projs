A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins, industrial sectors and groups of people) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties."
https://openalex.org/W2062290101,"MicroRNAs are regulatory, non-coding RNAs about 22 nucleotides in length: over 200 have been identified in humans, and their functions are beginning to be pinned down. It has been suggested that like other regulatory molecules they might be involved in tumour formation, and three papers in this issue confirm that this is the case. One cluster of microRNAs, known as mir-17–92, is shown to be a potential oncogene by its action in an in vivo model of human B-cell lymphoma. A cluster of microRNAs on human chromosome 13 has been found to be regulated by c-Myc, an important transcription factor that is overexpressed in many human cancers. And analysis of microRNA expression in over 300 individuals shows that microRNA profiles could be of value in cancer diagnosis. There is a global downregulation of microRNA in tumours, and the microRNA profile also reflects the origin and differentiation state of the tumours. To date, more than 200 microRNAs have been described in humans; however, the precise functions of these regulatory, non-coding RNAs remains largely obscure. One cluster of microRNAs, the mir-17–92 polycistron, is located in a region of DNA that is amplified in human B-cell lymphomas1. Here we compared B-cell lymphoma samples and cell lines to normal tissues, and found that the levels of the primary or mature microRNAs derived from the mir-17–92 locus are often substantially increased in these cancers. Enforced expression of the mir-17–92 cluster acted with c-myc expression to accelerate tumour development in a mouse B-cell lymphoma model. Tumours derived from haematopoietic stem cells expressing a subset of the mir-17–92 cluster and c-myc could be distinguished by an absence of apoptosis that was otherwise prevalent in c-myc-induced lymphomas. Together, these studies indicate that non-coding RNAs, specifically microRNAs, can modulate tumour formation, and implicate the mir-17–92 cluster as a potential human oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2163210644,"Numerous soluble proteins convert to insoluble amyloid-like fibrils that have common properties. Amyloid fibrils are associated with fatal diseases such as Alzheimer's, and amyloid-like fibrils can be formed in vitro. For the yeast protein Sup35, conversion to amyloid-like fibrils is associated with a transmissible infection akin to that caused by mammalian prions. A seven-residue peptide segment from Sup35 forms amyloid-like fibrils and closely related microcrystals, from which we have determined the atomic structure of the cross-beta spine. It is a double beta-sheet, with each sheet formed from parallel segments stacked in register. Side chains protruding from the two sheets form a dry, tightly self-complementing steric zipper, bonding the sheets. Within each sheet, every segment is bound to its two neighbouring segments through stacks of both backbone and side-chain hydrogen bonds. The structure illuminates the stability of amyloid fibrils, their self-seeding characteristic and their tendency to form polymorphic structures."

https://openalex.org/W2034412957,"One of the key characteristics of stem cells is their capacity to divide for long periods of time in an environment where most of the cells are quiescent. Therefore, a critical question in stem cell biology is how stem cells escape cell division stop signals. Here, we report the necessity of the microRNA (miRNA) pathway for proper control of germline stem cell (GSC) division in Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of GSCs mutant for dicer-1 (dcr-1), the double-stranded RNaseIII essential for miRNA biogenesis, revealed a marked reduction in the rate of germline cyst production. These dcr-1 mutant GSCs exhibit normal identity but are defective in cell cycle control. On the basis of cell cycle markers and genetic interactions, we conclude that dcr-1 mutant GSCs are delayed in the G1 to S transition, which is dependent on the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Dacapo, suggesting that miRNAs are required for stem cells to bypass the normal G1/S checkpoint. Hence, the miRNA pathway might be part of a mechanism that makes stem cells insensitive to environmental signals that normally stop the cell cycle at the G1/S transition."
https://openalex.org/W2041091929,"Solid oxide fuel cells are not suitable for powering small portable devices, mainly because if built small, they need heat input to keep them running. A new approach to fuel-cell design tackles that problem head on, resulting in the first thermally self-sustaining miniature solid-oxide fuel cell. In this cell, the heat is from the oxidation reaction at the anode. Good power densities are achieved, and as proof of principle, the cell has successfully driven an MP3 player. High energy efficiency and energy density, together with rapid refuelling capability, render fuel cells highly attractive for portable power generation1,2. Accordingly, polymer-electrolyte direct-methanol fuel cells are of increasing interest as possible alternatives to Li ion batteries3. However, such fuel cells face several design challenges and cannot operate with hydrocarbon fuels of higher energy density. Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) enable direct use of higher hydrocarbons4,5,6, but have not been seriously considered for portable applications because of thermal management difficulties at small scales, slow start-up and poor thermal cyclability. Here we demonstrate a thermally self-sustaining micro-SOFC stack with high power output and rapid start-up by using single chamber operation on propane fuel. The catalytic oxidation reactions supply sufficient thermal energy to maintain the fuel cells at 500–600 °C. A power output of ∼350 mW (at 1.0 V) was obtained from a device with a total cathode area of only 1.42 cm2."
https://openalex.org/W2157438953,"At the boundary between the Palaeocene and Eocene epochs, about 55 million years ago, the Earth experienced a strong global warming event, the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum. The leading hypothesis to explain the extreme greenhouse conditions prevalent during this period is the dissociation of 1,400 to 2,800 gigatonnes of methane from ocean clathrates, resulting in a large negative carbon isotope excursion and severe carbonate dissolution in marine sediments. Possible triggering mechanisms for this event include crossing a threshold temperature as the Earth warmed gradually, comet impact, explosive volcanism or ocean current reorganization and erosion at continental slopes, whereas orbital forcing has been excluded. Here we report a distinct carbonate-poor red clay layer in deep-sea cores from Walvis ridge, which we term the Elmo horizon. Using orbital tuning, we estimate deposition of the Elmo horizon at about 2 million years after the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum. The Elmo horizon has similar geochemical and biotic characteristics as the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum, but of smaller magnitude. It is coincident with carbon isotope depletion events in other ocean basins, suggesting that it represents a second global thermal maximum. We show that both events correspond to maxima in the approximately 405-kyr and approximately 100-kyr eccentricity cycles that post-date prolonged minima in the 2.25-Myr eccentricity cycle, implying that they are indeed astronomically paced."
https://openalex.org/W2123738009,"The spin of a confined electron, when oriented originally in some direction, will lose memory of that orientation after some time. Physical mechanisms leading to this relaxation of spin memory typically involve either coupling of the electron spin to its orbital motion or to nuclear spins. Relaxation of confined electron spin has been previously measured only for Zeeman or exchange split spin states, where spin-orbit effects dominate relaxation; spin flips due to nuclei have been observed in optical spectroscopy studies. Using an isolated GaAs double quantum dot defined by electrostatic gates and direct time domain measurements, we investigate in detail spin relaxation for arbitrary splitting of spin states. Here we show that electron spin flips are dominated by nuclear interactions and are slowed by several orders of magnitude when a magnetic field of a few millitesla is applied. These results have significant implications for spin-based information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2143495798,"Self-perpetuating changes in the conformations of amyloidogenic proteins play vital roles in normal biology and disease. Despite intense research, the architecture and conformational conversion of amyloids remain poorly understood. Amyloid conformers of Sup35 are the molecular embodiment of the yeast prion known as [PSI], which produces heritable changes in phenotype through self-perpetuating changes in protein folding. Here we determine the nature of Sup35's cooperatively folded amyloid core, and use this information to investigate central questions in prion biology. Specific segments of the amyloid core form intermolecular contacts in a ‘Head-to-Head’, ‘Tail-to-Tail’ fashion, but the ‘Central Core’ is sequestered through intramolecular contacts. The Head acquires productive interactions first, and these nucleate assembly. Variations in the length of the amyloid core and the nature of intermolecular interfaces form the structural basis of distinct prion ‘strains’, which produce variant phenotypes in vivo. These findings resolve several problems in yeast prion biology and have broad implications for other amyloids. Alzheimer's, prion diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders are associated with insoluble protein fibres called amyloid fibrils. Gathering structural information about these has proved difficult, but three groups now report success with contrasting approaches to the problem. The cover shows the atomic structure of the ‘spine’ of an amyloid-like fibril formed by the yeast prion protein Sup35. To obtain this structure, Nelson et al. performed X-ray crystallography on amyloid microcrystals. Krishnan and Lindquist used a raft of techniques to study folding of the amyloid core. And Ritter et al. determined the infectious conformation of HET-s prion of a filamentous fungus. Christopher Dobson ponders on what this flood of structural data says about prion and amyloid formation in sickness and in health."
https://openalex.org/W2060983898,"Prions are believed to be infectious, self-propagating polymers of otherwise soluble, host-encoded proteins. This concept is now strongly supported by the recent findings that amyloid fibrils of recombinant prion proteins from yeast, Podospora anserina and mammals can induce prion phenotypes in the corresponding hosts. However, the structural basis of prion infectivity remains largely elusive because acquisition of atomic resolution structural properties of amyloid fibrils represents a largely unsolved technical challenge. HET-s, the prion protein of P. anserina, contains a carboxy-terminal prion domain comprising residues 218-289. Amyloid fibrils of HET-s(218-289) are necessary and sufficient for the induction and propagation of prion infectivity. Here, we have used fluorescence studies, quenched hydrogen exchange NMR and solid-state NMR to determine the sequence-specific positions of amyloid fibril secondary structure elements of HET-s(218-289). This approach revealed four beta-strands constituted by two pseudo-repeat sequences, each forming a beta-strand-turn-beta-strand motif. By using a structure-based mutagenesis approach, we show that this conformation is the functional and infectious entity of the HET-s prion. These results correlate distinct structural elements with prion infectivity."

https://openalex.org/W2771050955,"Potent marine neurotoxins known as brevetoxins are produced by the 'red tide' dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. They kill large numbers of fish and cause illness in humans who ingest toxic filter-feeding shellfish or inhale toxic aerosols. The toxins are also suspected of having been involved in events in which many manatees and dolphins died, but this has usually not been verified owing to limited confirmation of toxin exposure, unexplained intoxication mechanisms and complicating pathologies. Here we show that fish and seagrass can accumulate high concentrations of brevetoxins and that these have acted as toxin vectors during recent deaths of dolphins and manatees, respectively. Our results challenge claims that the deleterious effects of a brevetoxin on fish (ichthyotoxicity) preclude its accumulation in live fish, and they reveal a new vector mechanism for brevetoxin spread through food webs that poses a threat to upper trophic levels."
https://openalex.org/W2039343199,"Considerable recent attention has focused on predicting how the losses of species and functional groups influence ecosystem properties, but the extent to which these effects vary among ecosystems remains poorly understood. Island systems have considerable scope for studying how biotic and abiotic factors influence processes in different ecosystems, because they enable the simultaneous study of large numbers of independent replicate systems at ecologically meaningful spatial scales. We studied a group of 30 islands in northern Sweden, for which island size determined disturbance history, and therefore vegetation successional stage and biotic and abiotic ecosystem properties. On each island we conducted a seven-year study that involved experimental removals of combinations of both plant functional groups and plant species. We show that although losses of functional groups and species often impaired key ecosystem processes, these effects were highly context-dependent and strongly influenced by island size. Our study provides evidence that the consequences of biotic loss for ecosystem functioning vary greatly among ecosystems and depend on the specific abiotic and biotic attributes of the system."
https://openalex.org/W2152182443,"It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2029641949,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α signals cell death and simultaneously induces the generation of ceramide, which is metabolized to sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) by ceramidase (CDase) and sphingosine kinase. Because the dynamic balance between the intracellular levels of ceramide and S1P (the “ceramide/S1P rheostat”) may determine cell survival, we investigated these sphingolipid signaling pathways in TNF-α-induced apoptosis of primary hepatocytes. Endogenous C16-ceramide was elevated during TNF-α-induced apoptosis in both rat and mouse primary hepatocytes. The putative acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) inhibitor imipramine inhibited TNF-α-induced apoptosis and C16-ceramide increase as did the knock out of ASMase. Overexpression of neutral CDase (NCDase) inhibited the TNF-α-induced increase of C16-ceramide and apoptosis in rat primary hepatocytes. Moreover, NCDase inhibited liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis in mice treated with d-galactosamine plus TNF-α. This protective effect was abrogated by the sphingosine kinase inhibitor N,N-demethylsphingosine, suggesting that the survival effect of NCDase is due to not only C16-ceramide reduction but also S1P formation. Administration of S1P or overexpression of NCDase activated the pro-survival kinase AKT, and overexpression of dominant negative AKT blocked the survival effect of NCDase. In conclusion, activation of ASMase and generation of C16-ceramide contributed to TNF-α-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. NCDase prevented apoptosis both by reducing C16-ceramide and by activation of AKT through S1P formation. Therefore, the cross-talk between sphingolipids and AKT pathway may determine hepatocyte apoptosis by TNF-α.

TNF-α is particularly important in the pathophysiology of hepatocytes, mediating viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and fulminant hepatitis (1Bradham C.A. Plumpe J. Manns M.P. Brenner D.A. Trautwein C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G387-G392PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α activates a variety of cellular signal transduction pathways, some of which result in apoptosis (2Osawa Y. Banno Y. Nagaki M. Nozawa Y. Moriwaki H. Nakashima S. Liver. 2001; 21: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 3Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). Ceramides are sphingolipid-derived signaling and regulatory intermediates that play a role in the stress response and cell death (4Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Stress stimuli such as TNF-α, Fas ligand, oxidative stress, growth factor withdrawal, anticancer drugs, ionizing radiation, heat shock, or ultraviolet light induce an elevation in the endogenous cellular levels of ceramides (4Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar, 5Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Ceramides are generated from the major membrane sphingolipid sphingomyelin by acid or neutral sphingomyelinases (ASMase), enzymes that are activated in response to TNF-α and other cytokines (6Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). ASMase knock-out mice are resistant against TNF-α-induced liver injury (7Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Calvo M. Enrich C. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, ceramides generated by ASMase have an important role in TNF-α-induced hepatocyte cell death. Besides apoptotic signals, TNF-α also activates molecules that protect cells from apoptosis. For example, TNF-α transmits anti-apoptotic signals via nuclear factor (NF)-κB and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT. Blocking these signaling pathways results in sensitization of hepatocytes to apoptosis induced by TNF-α (8Osawa Y. Banno Y. Nagaki M. Brenner D.A. Naiki T. Nozawa Y. Nakashima S. Moriwaki H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Hatano E. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1357-G1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition TNF-α activates sphingosine kinase (SphK), which converts sphingosine to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). This lipid-derived mediator prevents the cytotoxic action of TNF-α (8Osawa Y. Banno Y. Nagaki M. Brenner D.A. Naiki T. Nozawa Y. Nakashima S. Moriwaki H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Moreover, a model has been proposed in which the dynamic balance between the intracellular levels of ceramide and S1P (the “ceramide/S1P rheostat”) is an important factor that determines whether a cell survives or dies (11Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Ceramide is deacylated by either acid or neutral ceramidase (ACDase or NCDase) and converted to sphingosine. Overexpression of ACDase, which is localized in the lysosomes (12Li C.M. Hong S.B. Kopal G. He X. Linke T. Hou W.S. Koch J. Gatt S. Sandhoff K. Schuchman E.H. Genomics. 1998; 50: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), protects from TNF-α-induced apoptosis in murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells by reduction of intracellular ceramide and therefore in a shift of the ceramide/S1P rheostat in the direction of cell survival (13Strelow A. Bernardo K. Adam-Klages S. Linke T. Sandhoff K. Kronke M. Adam D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Besides an acidic form, a neutral ceramidase has been identified and cloned (14Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol.

NCDase is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acyl linkage in ceramide (10Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In rat hepatocytes, NCDase is localized in late endosomes/lysosomes because of the presence of a functional di-Leu motif in the putative amino acid sequences in NCDases, which is a sorting signal for vesicular transport from plasma membrane to endosomes/lysosomes, (10Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). More importantly, the roles of NCDases in TNF-α-induced hepatocyte apoptosis have not been addressed. In the present study, we evaluated the role of endogenous ceramide in apoptosis of rat primary hepatocytes induced by TNF-α. Preventing formation of endogenous ceramide or accelerating its clearance by overexpression of NCDase protected from TNF-α induced hepatocyte apoptosis. We provide evidence for an important role of AKT activation in this protective response. Materials—Cell culture media for rat and mouse primary hepatocytes, Waymouth's MB 752/1 and RPMI 1640, and recombinant human insulin were purchased from Invitrogen. Recombinant mouse TNF-α was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis MN). N, N,-Dimethyl-sphingosine (DMS), S1P, pertussis toxin (PTX), imipramine hydrochloride, LY 294002, ASMase from human placenta, Hoechst 33258 (bis-benzimide), propidium iodide, and anti-β-actin (clone AC-15) antibody were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 (9661) and phosphorylated AKT (Ser473) (9271) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-mouse and -rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). l-[3-3H]Serine was from Amersham Biosciences. d-Galactosamine hydrochloride (GalN) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents used were of the highest analytical grade available. Primary Hepatocyte Cultures and Treatments—Sprague-Dawley male rats (200–250 g) or ASMase knock-out mice (ASMase-/-), maintained in C57BL/6 background, were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine administered by intraperitoneal injection. Hepatocytes were then isolated by a nonrecirculating in situ collagenase perfusion of livers cannulating through the portal vein by a procedure modified from Moldeus et al. (17Moldeus P. Hogberg J. Orrenius S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Livers were first perfused in situ with 0.5 mm EGTA containing calcium-free salt solution, followed by perfusion with solution containing 0.02% collagenase D (Roche Applied Science). The liver was then gently minced on a Petri dish and filtered with polyamide mesh (3-60/42, Sefar America, Kansas City, MO). Hepatocytes were washed three times and centrifuged at 50 × g for 1 min. Cell viability was consistently 85% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells (1 × 105 and 1 × 106) were plated on 12-well and 60-mm dishes coated with rat collagen type I in Waymouth's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum containing antibiotics (plating medium). After 4 h, the culture was washed with PBS and changed to serum-free RPMI 1640 containing antibiotics in the presence or absence of recombinant adenoviruses (Ad5GFP, Ad5IκB, Ad5NCDase, Ad5CA-AKT, Ad5DN-AKT, and Ad5NFκB-Luc). After 2 h of incubation, the culture media were changed to serum-free RPMI 1640 containing antibiotics, and the cells were incubated for another 16 h. Before stimulation with 30 ng/ml mouse TNF-α or 1 μm S1P, the cells were washed with PBS and, if necessary, incubated for 1 or 2 h in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing the indicated agent(s): 50 μm imipramine in H2O, 10 μm DMS in Me2SO, ASMase (1 IU/ml). In some experiments, hepatocytes were pretreated with PTX for 12 h before adenovirus infection or S1P treatment. Adenoviruses—The adenovirus five variants Ad5IκB, Ad5GFP, Ad5CA-AKT, Ad5DN-AKT, and Ad5NF-κB-Luc expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-IκBα (S32A, S36A), green fluorescent protein, HA constitutively active (CA)-AKT encoding an amino-terminal myristoylation signal, HA-dominant negative (DN)-AKT, and an NF-κB driven luciferase reporter, respectively, have been described previously (9Hatano E.

The recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus Ad5NCDase was constructed by AdEasy™ adenoviral vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, the full-length of human NCDase DNA (GenBank™ accession number AF449759) was subcloned into pTrack adenoviral vector. The plasmid DNA was prepared by the alkaline lysis method and transfected into BJ5183-AD-1 electroporation-competent cells. The virus was grown in 293 cells and purified by banding twice on CsCl gradients and then stored in 10% (v/v) glycerol at -20 °C. Assessment of Cell Death—To assess cell death, cell cultures were double-stained with propidium iodide and Hoechst 33258. Propidium iodide is a vital nucleic acid-staining dye that penetrates cells with compromised plasma membrane (necrotic cells). Morphological changes in the nuclei of cells undergoing apoptotic cell death were determined by staining with the DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33258. Apoptotic nuclear changes include condensation, margination, and segmentation of the nuclei into several fragments. Briefly, cells were stained with both dyes (100 μm) for 20 min and examined under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus IX72, Tokyo, Japan). Quantitation of apoptotic and necrotic cells was performed by counting at least 500 cells and was expressed as a percentage of total cells counted. Animal Treatment—The experiments were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines by Columbia University. Eight-week-old male BALB/c mice were infected with Ad5GFP or Ad5NCDase (1 × 109 plaque-forming units) by intravenously injecting the tail vein. GalN was dissolved in sterile, nonpyrogenic saline solution and was administered to the mice intraperitoneally (20 mg/mouse), 2 days after adenovirus administration. Recombinant mouse TNF-α was diluted with pyrogen-free saline and injected to mice intravenously (0.5 μg/mouse) 30 min after GalN treatment. Treated animals were anesthetized and killed by withdrawal of blood from the inferior vena cava. Hepatocellular injury was monitored biochemically by measuring serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity. The liver was excised, fixed with 10% buffered formalin, sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for light microscopic examination. Apoptotic cells were estimated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, which relies on incorporation of labeled dUTP at sites of DNA breaks. For the TUNEL procedure, all reagents, including buffers, were parts of a kit (ApopTag, Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis—For the preparation of total cell proteins, cells or frozen liver were sonicated in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium molybdate, 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were first incubated with the primary antibodies and then incubated with the anti-mouse or -rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Detection was performed with an ECL system. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs isolated from hepatocytes infected with Ad5NCDase or Ad5GFP were reverse-transcribed using random hexamer mixed primers. cDNAs were amplified with the following primer sets: human NCDase sense, 5′-AGAACCTGATGGGTCCAATCG-3′, and human NCDase antisense, 5′-GGGACAAGTGCTATTGGCGTTA-3′; rat NCDase sense, 5′-TGAAGACGACGTGTAAAGCCGC-3′, and rat NCDase antisense, 5′-TGCGATAACGACAGTCATATCC, at an annealing temperature of 58 °C. After amplification, PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. NF-κB Reporter Gene Assay—Hepatocytes were infected with Ad5NF-κBluc (10 m.o.i.) and Ad5IκB or Ad5GFP for 18 h. NF-κB-dependent gene transcription was analyzed 8 h later on a luminometer (FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG LABTECH, Inc., Durham, NC) using an enhanced luciferase assay kit (Pharmingen) and adjusted for protein content. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Lipids—These were performed using electrospray ionization MS/MS analysis on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer, operating in multiple reaction monitoring positive ionization mode as described previously (21Pettus B.J. Bielawski J. Porcelli A.M. Reames D.L. Johnson K.R. Morrow J. Chalfant C.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Measurement of S1P Formation—S1P formation was measured as described previously (8Osawa Y. Banno Y. Nagaki M. Brenner D.A. Naiki T. Nozawa Y. Nakashima S. Moriwaki H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. For the radiolabeling of sphingolipids, the primary rat hepatocytes were incubated with the plating medium containing [3H]serine (2 μCi/ml) for 12 h. The medium was then changed to serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing [3H]serine, and the cells were incubated for another 18 h with or without adenovirus infection. The radiolabeled cells were stimulated with or without S1P, and the cellular lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer and separated on TLC plates in the solvent system of 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (60:20:20, v/v). The radiolabeled S1P spot, identified by comigration with an authentic standard, was scraped off from the plate, and the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Increase of C16-ceramide Levels during TNF-α-induced Hepatocyte Apoptosis—TNF-α induced NF-κB activation in rat primary hepatocytes as determined by luciferase assay. The activation was almost abolished when hepatocytes were infected with Ad5IκB but not with the control adenovirus Ad5GFP (Fig. 1A). Normal hepatocytes are usually resistant to the cytotoxicity of TNF-α. However, infection with Ad5IκB sensitizes hepatocytes to TNF-α-mediated apoptosis (8Osawa Y. Banno Y. Nagaki M. Brenner D.A.

To determine the extent of cell death induced by TNF-α under these conditions, hepatocytes were labeled with propidium iodide, a vital stain, and the permeable DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33258. Ad5IκB infection sensitized hepatocytes to both apoptosis and necrosis induced by TNF-α (Fig. 1B), as reported previously. Previous studies have demonstrated that TNF-α causes activation of caspases in hepatocytes infected with Ad5IκB (8Osawa Y. Banno Y. Nagaki M. Brenner D.A. Naiki T. Nozawa Y. Nakashima S. Moriwaki H.

Moreover, Ad5CrmA infection, which expresses crmA, a serpin inhibitor of a subset of caspases including caspases-1 and -8 (24Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R.

Previous studies demonstrated that TNF-α induces ceramide formation in hepatocytes by activation of ASMase (7Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Calvo M. Enrich C. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 26Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Kronke M. J. Biol.

Nagaki M. Nozawa Y. Moriwaki H. Nakashima S. Liver. 2001; 21: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). Although total ceramide levels in response to TNF-α did not show remarkable change in both Ad5GFP- and Ad5IκB-infected hepatocytes (Fig. 1D), C16-ceramide increased 1.7-fold in Ad5IκB-infected hepatocytes after TNF-α treatment (Fig. 1D). Thus, TNF-α-induced cell death was accompanied with selective increase in the levels of only one ceramide species. Protective Effect of ASMase Inhibition against Hepatocyte Apoptosis by TNF-α—We next aimed to determine the role of C16-ceramide in cell death. We initially attempted to examine the effects of exogenous C16-ceramide. However, rat primary hepatocytes did not take up C16-ceramide even when dissolved in ethanol/dodecane (98:2, v/v) (data not shown). Therefore, we resorted to a combination of pharmacologic, molecular, and genetic approaches to investigate the role of endogenous ceramide. It was reported previously (7Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Calvo M. Enrich C. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that ASMase knock-out mice are resistant to TNF-α-induced liver injury. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, induces the proteolysis of the active 72-kDa ASMase form and hence inhibits ASMase activity (28Grassme H. Gulbins E. Brenner B. Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. Harzer K. Lang F. Meyer T.F. Cell. 1997; 91: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with imipramine protected rat primary hepatocytes from apoptosis and necrosis induced by Ad5IκB plus TNF-α (Fig. 2A, left panel). However, because imipramine may have pleiotropic effects, we also used ASMase knock-out mice. Indeed, primary hepatocytes from ASMase knock-out mice showed less apoptosis and necrosis than wild type hepatocytes (Fig. 2A, right panel). Furthermore, imipramine treatment or ASMase knock-out cells prevented the increase of C16-ceramde by Ad5IκB plus TNF-α (Fig. 2B), and exogenous ASMase administration reversed susceptibility of apoptosis in ASMase knock-out hepatocytes (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that ASMase activation and C16-ceramde accumulation contribute to hepatocyte apoptosis. Protective Effects of NCDase Overexpression in Hepatocytes— Ceramide levels are regulated not only through formation (e.g. by SMase) but also by degradation through the action of CDases. Besides an acidic form, which is localized in the lysosomes (12Li C.M. Hong S.B. Kopal G. He X. Linke T. Hou W.S. Koch J. Gatt S. Sandhoff K. Schuchman E.H. Genomics. 1998; 50: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a neutral ceramidase has been identified and cloned (14Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11229-11234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T. Bielawska A. Lemasters J.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21508-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this neutral ceramidase may play a role in counterbalancing ceramide generation by the sphingomyelinases. Thus, we constructed a human NCDase expressing adenovirus, and we investigated its effects on TNF-α-induced apoptosis. PCR analysis revealed that human NCDase was expressed in Ad5NCDase-infected rat primary hepatocytes and that endogenous rat NCDase levels were not affected by Ad5NCDase infection (Fig. 3A). Ad5NCDase infection increased the survival of rat primary hepatocyte apoptosis after TNF-α and reduced caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 3B), but Ad5NCDase did not effect the expression of IκB mutant form by Ad5IκB (supplemental Fig. 1). Ad5NCDase induced the largest decrease in C16-ceramide (40% reduction) (Table I) followed by C18:1- and C18-ceramide (20% reduction). On the other hand, C24- and C24:1-ceramide levels were not significantly affected. The levels of C14-, dihydro-C16-, and C20-ceramide were extremely low in hepatocytes. Ad5NCDase infection inhibited the increase of C16-ceramide by Ad5IκB plus TNF-α (Fig. 3C). To assess further the protective role of NCDase during hepatocyte apoptosis, its effect on TNF-α-mediated liver injury was examined in vivo. Administration of Ad5NCDase via tail vein, which expresses both NCDase and GFP, resulted in GFP expression and NCDase mRNA expression in liver of BALB/c mice (supplemental Fig. 2). In BALB/c mice infected with Ad5GFP, GalN plus TNF-α elicited liver damage, and the serum ALT level increased to about 7000 IU/liter at 6 h (Fig. 4A). Histological analysis revealed that GalN plus TNF-α resulted in pronounced hepatocyte destruction in large areas of the liver (Fig. 4B, upper panel), with many TUNEL-positive hepatocytes (Fig. 4B, lower panel), and an increase in caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 4C). Overexpression of NCDase reduced serum ALT levels by ∼70% (Fig. 4A). Moreover, overexpression of NCDase reversed morphological changes induced by GalN plus TNF-α and strongly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive hepatocytes (Fig. 4B) and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 4C). Thus, overexpression of neutral ceramidase protects from TNF-α-induced hepatotoxicity.Table IChanges in the sphingolipid profile in Ad5NCDase-infected hepatocytes Rat primary hepatocytes were infected with Ad5GFP or Ad5NCDase.

https://openalex.org/W2150938638,"Titan is the only satellite in our Solar System with a dense atmosphere. The surface pressure is 1.5 bar (ref. 1) and, similar to the Earth, N2 is the main component of the atmosphere. Methane is the second most important component, but it is photodissociated on a timescale of 10(7) years (ref. 3). This short timescale has led to the suggestion that Titan may possess a surface or subsurface reservoir of hydrocarbons to replenish the atmosphere. Here we report near-infrared images of Titan obtained on 26 October 2004 by the Cassini spacecraft. The images show that a widespread methane ocean does not exist; subtle albedo variations instead suggest topographical variations, as would be expected for a more solid (perhaps icy) surface. We also find a circular structure approximately 30 km in diameter that does not resemble any features seen on other icy satellites. We propose that the structure is a dome formed by upwelling icy plumes that release methane into Titan's atmosphere."

https://openalex.org/W1998775587,"Here we solve a 2.4-A structure of a truncated version of the reverse-direction myosin motor, myosin VI, that contains the motor domain and binding sites for two calmodulin molecules. The structure reveals only minor differences in the motor domain from that in plus-end directed myosins, with the exception of two unique inserts. The first is near the nucleotide-binding pocket and alters the rates of nucleotide association and dissociation. The second unique insert forms an integral part of the myosin VI converter domain along with a calmodulin bound to a novel target motif within the insert. This serves to redirect the effective 'lever arm' of myosin VI, which includes a second calmodulin bound to an 'IQ motif', towards the pointed (minus) end of the actin filament. This repositioning largely accounts for the reverse directionality of this class of myosin motors. We propose a model incorporating a kinesin-like uncoupling/docking mechanism to provide a full explanation of the movements of myosin VI."
https://openalex.org/W2071854567,"Conventional measures of age count years since birth. But as lives lengthen, it becomes important for many aspects of decision making to think of age also in terms of years left until death or in proportion to the expanding life span. Warren C. Sanderson and Sergei Scherbov, two of the authors of the paper “The end of world population growth” (Nature 412, 543–545; 2001) that has been influential in shaping population predictions, have turned their attention to this aspect of ageing. They present a new measure of age, the median age of the population standardized for expected remaining years of life. The populations of developed nations such as Germany, Japan and the United States are growing older as measured by median ages, but in the near future they will experience periods in which they grow younger on this new measure, with implications for matters such as the cost of medical care, retirement and the accumulation of capital. Increases in median ages, the most commonly used measure of population ageing1,2, are rapid in today's wealthier countries2,3, and population ageing is widely considered to be a significant challenge to the well-being of citizens there4. Conventional measures of age count years since birth; however, as lives lengthen, we need to think of age also in terms of years left until death or in proportion to the expanding lifespan. Here we propose a new measure of ageing: the median age of the population standardized for expected remaining years of life. We show, using historical data and forecasts for Germany, Japan and the United States, that although these populations will be growing older, as measured by their median ages, they will probably experience periods in which they grow younger, as measured by their standardized median ages. Furthermore, we provide forecasts for these countries of the old-age dependency ratio rescaled for increases in life expectancy at birth5. These ratios are forecasted to change much less than their unscaled counterparts, and also exhibit periods when the population is effectively growing younger."
https://openalex.org/W2023669293,"Acute μ and κ opioids activate the ERK/MAPK phosphorylation cascade that represents an integral part of the signaling pathway of growth factors in astrocytes. By this cross-talk, opioids may impact neural development and plasticity among other basic neurobiological processes in vivo. The μ agonist, [d-ala2,mephe4,glyol5]enkephalin (DAMGO), induces a transient stimulation of ERK phosphorylation, whereas κ agonist, U69,593, engenders sustained ERK activation. Here we demonstrate that acute U69,593 and DAMGO stimulate ERK phosphorylation by utilization of different secondary messengers and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms upstream of the growth factor pathway. Immortalized astrocytes transfected with either antisense calmodulin (CaM), a mutant μ opioid receptor that binds CaM poorly or a dominant negative mutant of PKCϵ were used as a model system to study μ signaling. Evidence was gained to implicate CaM and PKCϵ in DAMGO stimulation of ERK. DAMGO activation of PKCϵ and/or ERK was insensitive to selective inhibitors of Ca2+ mobilization, but it was blocked upon phospholipase C inhibition. These results suggest a novel mechanism wherein, upon DAMGO binding, CaM is released from the μ receptor and activates phospholipase C. Subsequently, phospholipase C generates diacylglycerides that activate PKCϵ. In contrast, U69,593 appears to act via phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PKCζ, and Ca2+ mobilization. These signaling components were implicated based on studies with specific inhibitors and a dominant negative mutant of PKCζ.

The μ agonist, [d-ala2,mephe4,gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO), induces a transient activation of ERK that dissipates within 30 min, whereas that of the κ ligand U69,593 persists for several hours. In addition, chronic μ opioids inhibit growth factor-induced ERK activation, whereas chronic U69,593 does not. Examples of differential signaling mechanisms by subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are replete in the literature and are consistent with their possession of distinct functions (e.g. see Refs. 2Hawes B.E. Fried S. Yao X.R. Weig B. Graziano M.P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1024-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and 3Olivares-Reyes J.A. Jayadev S. Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Smith R.D. Mol.

In studies of another astrocytic model system, rat C6 glioma cells, these differences in chronic μ and κ opioid regulation of ERK activity correlated well with their actions on mitogenesis, consistent with other evidence indicating that the ERK member of the MAPK family is implicated in cell proliferation (4Bohn L.M. Belcheva M.M. Coscia C.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that occur in the GPCR branch of the heterologous pathway by which μ and κ opioids signal to ERK/MAPK have not been studied in detail in comparison with the better understood steps downstream in the growth factor phase. Since opioid signaling to ERK may underlie basic mechanisms related to neuroplasticity as well as to cell proliferation, the early phase of this signaling pathway was investigated. PKC is an integral component of most GPCR signaling pathways to ERK/MAPK (5Belcheva M.M. Coscia C.J. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PKC was found to be an early signaling component in the opioid pathway to ERK (6Fukuda K. Kato S. Morikawa H. Shoda T. Mori K. J.

GPCR-mediated ERK activation via EGF receptor transactivation (9Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) is one of a number of cell- and GPCR-specific variations of this type of cross-talk that were detected (5Belcheva M.M.

In earlier studies, PKC was found to play a role in directly activating Raf-1 and thereby circumventing involvement of the receptor tyrosine kinases (11Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Recently, PKC was also implicated in the activation of the MMP/ADAMs that are responsible for the release of extracellular membrane-bound EGF-like ligands, which trigger EGF receptor transactivation (12Pierce K.L.

Although the phosphoinositide kinases (PI3Ks) are found in many growth factor signaling pathways, the γ isoform can also mediate GPCR signaling to ERK upstream of the growth factor pathway in some cells (13Lopez-Ilasaca M.

The Gβγ subunit of heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins activates PI3Kγ, which then acts on the 3′-OH position of phosphatidyl myo-inositol lipids to release different phosphorylated lipid products as secondary messengers.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, selective PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin) have been used to implicate this signaling component. Opioid stimulation of ERK is wortmannin-sensitive in COS-7 but not in C6 glioma cells, wherein MOR is overexpressed (18Belcheva M.M. Haas P.D. Tan Y. Heaton V.M. Coscia C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In prior investigations with HEK293 cells, we obtained evidence to suggest that the μ opioid pathway leading to EGF receptor and ERK activation featured the Ca2+-binding protein, CaM, as a secondary messenger and PKC as an intermediate (7Belcheva M.M. Szucs M. Wang D.X. Sadee W. Coscia C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33847-33853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This work was prompted by the discovery of the ability of CaM to bind to GPCRs such as MOR, dopamine, vasopressin, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor (19Bofill-Cardona E. Kudlacek O. Yang Q.

In the case of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes 5 and 7, interaction with CaM was Ca2+-dependent, but MOR binding to CaM was shown to be at least partially Ca2+-independent (20Wang D.X. Sadee W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Direct evidence that CaM binding to MOR initiates signaling to ERK was obtained by using cells stably transfected with wild type human MOR or with a mutant MOR (K273A) that was shown to bind CaM poorly and coupled more efficiently to G protein in the original studies by Sadee and co-workers (7Belcheva M.M.

Here the roles of PKC isoforms, PLC, PI3K, and CaM in μ and κ opioid activation of ERK were assessed in astrocytes. Reagents—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma with the following exceptions: DAMGO-trifluoroacetate was obtained from Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA); U69,593 was from NIDA Drug Supply (Research Triangle, NC); EGF (human, recombinant) was from Invitrogen; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were from ATCC (Manassas, VA); phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), CaM inhibitors N-(6-aminohexyl)5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide and fluphenazine, PLC inhibitor U73122, PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, tyrphostin AG1478, and protein kinase C inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I (GFX) and Gö6983 were from Calbiochem; Protein G plus A-agarose suspension was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). The following antibodies (Abs) were purchased: anti-phospho-ERK Ab from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); CaM and EGFR (sheep polyclonal or mouse monoclonal) Abs from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA); and ERK, PKC isoform, and actin Abs from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Cultures—Rat cortical astrocytes (CTX TNA2, ATCC) were established from cultures of primary type 1 astrocytes from 1-day-old rat brain frontal cortex. The cultures were originally transfected with a DNA construct containing the oncogenic early region of SV40 under the transcriptional control of the human glial acidic fibrillary protein promoter (24Radany E.H. Brenner M. Besnard F. Bigornia V. Bishop J.M. Deschepper C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6467-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The astrocytes have the phenotypic characteristics of type 1. The cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 for up to 20–35 passages. For all experiments in which endogenous MOR or KOR were activated, early passage (passages 3–10) cells were grown in 6-well plates at least overnight to adhere well to the plate surface. Later passage (passages 10–35) cells were used for MOR/KOR transfection experiments. Optimal starvation of cultures was achieved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium devoid of serum for 24 h. In all assays, agonists or inhibitors were delivered in serum-free media. Transient and Stable Transfections—Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 (for mock transfections), rat or human MOR, human K273A-MOR, rat KOR (in pcDNA3 or pCMV-neo expression vectors), or dnPKCϵ or dnPKCζ. The aforementioned cDNAs of MORs, KOR, dnPKCϵ, and dnPKCζ were kind gifts from Drs. W. Sadee, H. Akil, P. Blumberg, and S. Gutkind, respectively). Transfections were conducted using 1–2 μg of cDNA and 3–6 μl of FuGENE 6 following the manufacturer's instructions. After 24–48 h of incubation, transfection medium was replaced with serum-free medium for an additional 24 h. The efficiency of transfection was determined to be 9 ± 1% (n = 6) by in situ identification of cells expressing β-galactosidase. Negative controls included untransfected and/or mock-transfected cells. Since the ATCC immortalized rat cortical astrocytes under investigation are transfectants selected with G418, we used zeocin (400 μg/ml) as a selection marker to prepare rat wild type MOR and/or antisense CaM stable transfections. Six clones were generated with stably transfected wild type MOR, and their MOR binding and DAMGO activation of ERK were assessed. The stable transfectants show a direct correlation between DAMGO binding to MOR and the extent of DAMGO-induced ERK phosphorylation. Stably transfected MOR clones activate ERK to a greater extent and have higher MOR binding levels than cells with endogenous MOR. DAMGO activation of ERK assays was performed only with clones containing 100–200 fmol/mg protein, a MOR concentration routinely found in rat forebrain. They gave on average 5-fold stimulation of ERK phosphorylation, whereas that of transiently transfected or untransfected cells was about 3-fold higher than basal levels in these studies. Antisense CaM stable transfectants were also generated, and 11 clones displayed CaM levels ranging from 20 to 90% lower than control immortalized astrocytes as determined by Western blotting with a CaM Ab (Upstate). Immunoblotting was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Membrane Preparation—Cells were harvested and homogenized by gentle disruption in a “cell cracker” as described (25Belcheva M. Barg J. Rowinski J. Clark W.G. Gloeckner C.A. Ho A. Gao X.M. Chuang D.M. Coscia C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 104-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A membrane fraction (P20) was prepared from cell homogenates by sedimenting at 20,000 × g for 20 min. A mixture containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 200 μg/ml bacitracin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, during the preparation of this membrane fraction. These P20 membrane preparations were used in MOR binding and phospho-PKC immunoblotting experiments. MOR Binding—P20 membranes (300–500 μg/ml) were incubated with 1–5 nm3H-labeled DAMGO (35 Ci/mmol) at room temperature for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1–10 μm DAMGO. Reactions were terminated by the addition of cold Tris buffer to the tubes followed by rapid filtration over GF/B filters in a Brandel cell harvester (Brandel Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Filters were washed twice with cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer and then counted. Total and specific binding were calculated in fmol of MOR/mg of protein for each MOR-transfected cell line. PKC Isoform Translocation and Activation—Membrane and cytosolic fractions were isolated from rat astrocytes using the method of Krotova et al. (26Krotova K.Y. Zharikov S.I. Block E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L1037-L1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells treated with opioids or vehicle were washed several times with PBS and collected by scraping in the presence of 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EGTA, 2mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell suspensions were sonicated and were spun at 1000 × g for 5 min, to remove unbroken cells, cell debris, and nuclear pellet and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction, whereas the pellet was resuspended in the above Tris buffer and used as the membrane fraction. Levels of PKCϵ and PKCζ were measured by immunoblotting with the corresponding Abs (27Brandlin I. Eiseler T. Salowsky R. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45451-45457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in both cytosolic and membrane fractions from rat astrocytes. PKCϵ and PKCζ activation was also measured in P20 membrane fractions from rat astrocytes by immunoblotting, applying phospho-PKCϵ (Ser729; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and phospho-PKCζ (Thr410/403; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) Abs and following the manufacturers' instructions. ERK Assay—ERK phosphorylation was measured by immunoblotting as described (7Belcheva M.M. Szucs M. Wang D.X. Sadee W. Coscia C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33847-33853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated first with different inhibitors and then with DAMGO or U69,593 as described in each figure legends. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysed with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration of the supernatants was determined. Samples (10–20 μg of protein/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were blotted on Immobilon P™ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST). Blots were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with anti-phospho-ERK Ab, diluted 1:2000 in TBST for at least 15 h at 4 °C. After three washes with TBST, blots were incubated with 1:2000 diluted goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. For assurance of equivalent total ERK protein per lane, representative blots were stripped (0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5, 60 min at room temperature) and exposed to ERK Ab, followed by goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG. Bands were visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to Classic Blue sensitive x-ray film (Molecular Technologies, St. Louis, MO). Band intensities were determined by densitometric analysis using a Kodak DC120 digital camera, Kodak ds 1D version 3.0.2 software (Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT), and NIH ImageJ, version 1.32j. EGFR Immunoprecipitation—The EGFR immunoprecipitation protocol followed a previously described procedure (7Belcheva M.M. Szucs M. Wang D.X. Sadee W. Coscia C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33847-33853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved cells were administered DAMGO or U69,593 (0.1 μm, 3–5 min). Cultures were lysed by using a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF. Cell lysates of 0.8–1.2 mg of protein (diluted to ∼1 μg/μl) were used. EGFR was immunoprecipitated by adding 5–10 μg of either a mouse monoclonal or sheep polyclonal anti-EGFR Ab (Upstate) to the lysates and incubating overnight at 4 °C. This step was followed by the addition of a 50-μl suspension of protein G plus A-Sepharose beads per sample and incubation for 3–4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with PBS, resuspended in SDS loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min before SDS-PAGE. Proteins were blotted on Immobilon P™ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and tested with Tyr(P) Ab (Cell Signaling) and peroxidase-conjugated mouse secondary Ab. Bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system as described above. Protein Assay and Statistical Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) as a standard. Statistical determinations were made by t test analysis (version 2.01; GraphPad Software, Inc.). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. μ and κ Opioid-induced ERK Phosphorylation Is Mediated by Different PKC Isoforms—Previously, both time and dose dependence plots for DAMGO and U69,593 were obtained for cortical type 1 immortalized astrocytes to optimize conditions for ERK activation by these opioids (Ref. 1Belcheva M.M. Tan Y. Heaton V.M. Clark A.L. Coscia C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1391-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and data not shown). Selective μ (CTAP) and κ (nor-binaltorphimine) opioids inhibited DAMGO and U69,593, respectively. Although PKC mediates the activation of ERK by all opioid receptor subtypes in a number of cell lines, including C6 glioma cells (4Bohn L.M. Belcheva M.M. Coscia C.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Fukuda K. Kato S. Morikawa H. Shoda T. Mori K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Belcheva M.M. Szucs M. Wang D.X. Sadee W. Coscia C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33847-33853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), initial experiments with the cortical astrocytes revealed that the general PKC inhibitor, GFX, blocked μ opioid-induced ERK phosphorylation but not that by κ (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the opioids under investigation here use different PKC isoforms in this signaling pathway than those in previously studied cells, we assessed the effects of another PKC inhibitor, Gö6983, which complements the PKC isoform selectivity profile of GFX (Fig. 1, B and C). Gö6983 abolished U69,593-induced ERK phosphorylation without affecting that of three different μ opioid agonists, DAMGO, morphine, and endomorphin. Of the ∼11 known isozymes of PKC, GFX inhibits all of the conventional isoforms (α, β1, β2, γ) that are DAG- and Ca2+-dependent and several novel isoforms (δ, ϵ) that are DAG-dependent but do not require Ca2+ (29Chow J.Y.C. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21169-21176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Whereas Gö6983 is also selective for conventional PKC isoforms, it inhibits PKCδ and the atypical PKCζ that is insensitive to Ca2+ and DAG (29Chow J.Y.C. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21169-21176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the basis of the isoform selectivity profiles of the two PKC inhibitors, we tested DAMGO for its ability to activate PKCϵ. Both PKCϵ membrane translocation (Fig. 2A) and phosphorylation assays (Fig. 2B) showed that the μ opioid activated this PKC. Time course studies on DAMGO-induced PKCϵ phosphorylation suggested that it peaks at 3 min, and by 5 min it is reduced to basal levels (data not shown). Transfection of astrocytes with a dominant negative mutant of PKCϵ attenuated DAMGO-induced phosphorylation of both PKCϵ (Fig. 2B) and ERK (Fig. 2C). Alternately, U69,593 signaling to ERK was not affected by the expression of dnPKCϵ in astrocytes (11 ± 1.4 in control cells versus 12 ± 1.5 in dnPKCϵ-expressing cells, n = 4). The data implicate PKCϵ in μ opioid signaling to ERK. μ Opioid-induced PKCϵ and ERK Phosphorylation Is Mediated by PLC but Not PI3K—There are reports that PKCϵ can be activated by either DAG, which is normally generated by PLC hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositide (30Chen C.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), or by PI3K (29Chow J.Y.C. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21169-21176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To address this question, the phorbol ester PMA, which mimics DAG by binding at its activation site on some PKCs, was tested and found to stimulate PKCϵ phosphorylation to about the same extent as DAMGO (Fig. 3A). This issue was further examined by subjecting astrocytes to chronic PMA, which down-regulates PKCs that contain a DAG binding site. Accordingly, overnight treatment of astrocytes with PMA abolished DAMGO- but not U69,593-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Evidence that PLC generates the DAG in question was obtained by demonstrating that a specific inhibitor of this enzyme, U73112, attenuated DAMGO-induced phosphorylation of both PKCϵ (Fig. 3A) and ERK (Fig. 3C). Moreover, selective inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin and LY294002, had no effect on μ opioid-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). As a member of the novel PKC isoform family, PKCϵ should be Ca2+-independent. Accordingly, we measured the intermediacy of Ca2+ mobilization and discovered that μ activation of ERK was not blocked by nifedipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor, or by dantrolene, an inhibitor of microsomal Ca2+ release (Fig. 3D). CaM Is a Secondary Messenger in μ Opioid-induced ERK Phosphorylation—How is PLC activated to generate DAG? There is evidence to suggest that CaM can activate PLCβ (31McCullar J.S. Larsen S.A. Millimaki R.A. Filtz T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33708-33713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In prior studies using HEK293 cells, we discovered that the μ opioid pathway leading to growth factor transactivation featured CaM as a second messenger and PKC as an intermediate (7Belcheva M.M. Szucs M. Wang D.X. Sadee W. Coscia C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33847-33853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, we took three different approaches to implicate CaM in astrocytes. CaM antagonists, N-(6-aminohexyl)5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide and fluphenazine, were shown to attenuate DAMGO stimulation of ERK phosphorylation (data not shown). However, these antagonists are not completely selective. A second approach entailed the use of astrocytes stably transfected with CaM antisense cDNA. For the antisense experiments shown here a clone was adopted that displayed 55% less CaM than basal levels (n = 3; see inset in Fig. 4A). Astrocytes transfected with CaM antisense and transiently transfected with MOR were treated with DAMGO or, in some cases, morphine and were found to be incapable of stimulating ERK activity (Fig. 4A). However, CaM antisense clones transiently transfected with KOR retained their ability to mediate κ opioid activation of ERK (Fig. 4B). Astrocytes of similar passage number were also transiently transfected with MOR or KOR and used as controls in these experiments. In some cells, CaM has been implicated in the modulation of growth factor-induced ERK activation. This can occur either by a direct interaction with Ras-Raf (32Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) or EGFR itself (33San Jose E. Benguria A. Geller P. Villalobo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15237-15245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although CaM kinases have been implicated in activation of MAPKs (34Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J.S. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), some have also been shown to phosphorylate EGFR and reduce its response to EGF in CHO cells (35Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C.

The molecular mechanisms that support the feasibility for the potential use of the salen manganese complexes as therapy for PD are far from being completely elucidated. The results of the current investigation demonstrate, for the first time, the capacity of these potentially therapeutic antioxidant compounds to neuroprotect against selective dopaminergic midbrain cell death not only in vitro but also in vivo in an animal model of the disease. Materials—3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT),1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridium dichloride (paraquat), protease inhibitor mixture, lactacystin, and monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and SDS-PAGE gels were obtained from Bio-Rad. Rabbit anti-phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63), anti-cleaved caspase-3, and anti-caspase-3 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit and sheep anti-tyrosine hydroxylase polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Media and sera were purchased from Invitrogen. Salen manganese complexes were gifts from Eukarion, Inc. (Bedford, MA). Osmotic minipumps (Alzet 2004) were from Alza Scientific Products (Mountain View, CA). Cell Culture—The rat dopaminergic cell line 1RB3AN27 (N27) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cell viability was determined by MTT incorporation (22Peng J. Wu Z. Wu Y. Hsu M. Stevenson F.F. Boonplueang R. Roffler-Tarlov S.K. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44285-44291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation was examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) analysis with an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions (22Peng J. Wu Z. Wu Y. Hsu M. Stevenson F.F. Boonplueang R. Roffler-Tarlov S.K. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44285-44291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Stained cells were counted in 10 randomly chosen microscopic fields (at least 500 cells). Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the percentage of total cells that displayed TUNEL staining. To evaluate the effect of the salen manganese complexes on cell death, these compounds were added 1 h prior to paraquat or lactacystin. Caspase-3 activity was performed using a commercially available kit from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) as previously described (22Peng J. Wu Z. Wu Y. Hsu M. Stevenson F.F. Boonplueang R. Roffler-Tarlov S.K. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44285-44291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pelleted and subsequently lysed. Whole supernatant following sedimentation was incubated with the synthetic substrate cabobenzoxy-Asp-Glu-val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin for 2 h at 37 °C. Measurements were made on a fluorescent microplate reader using filters for excitation (400 nm) and detection of emitted light (530 nm). Serial dilutions of amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin were used as standards. A negative control in which caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-chloromethyl ketone) was added and a positive control containing apopain were used to test the efficacy of the assay. Primary Mesencephalic Cultures—Primary mesencephalic cell cultures were prepared from embryonic gestation day 14-15 mouse embryos as described previously (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated cells were seeded at 7 × 105 cells per well onto poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well culture plates. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide, in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% B27 supplement, 2 mm glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After 4 days, one-half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were grown an additional 2 days and then treated with 40 μm paraquat for 18 or 24 h. The number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in mesencephalic cultures was determined as described previously (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The specificity of neurotoxicity was analyzed by double label immunostaining with the anti-TH antibody and antibodies against phospho-JNK, phospho-c-Jun, and cleaved caspase-3, respectively, as described previously (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated with cultures isolated from four independent dissections. Immunocytochemistry—Cultures were and fixed with paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline as described previously (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies included the following: sheep polyclonal anti-TH (1: 500), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-JNK (1:100), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Jun (1:100), and rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:200). The secondary antibodies were rhodamine-conjugated rat-absorbed donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:200) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-sheep IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA, 1:200). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector) was used to counterstain nuclei. Control experiments included omitting primary antibody. Salen Manganese Complex Administration in Vivo—Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in 70% N2O/30% O2 and subcutaneously implanted with an osmotic minipump containing either 5% mannitol (as vehicle control) or 15 mm EUK-189 (dissolved in 5% mannitol). Pumps delivered EUK-189 at a rate of 0.25 μl/h for a 28-day period. The calculated compound infusion rate was ∼0.09 μmol/day (21Liu R. Liu I.Y. Bi X. Thompson R.F. Doctrow S.R. Malfroy B. Baudry M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8526-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Paraquat Administration—Mice were intraperitoneally injected with either saline or 7 mg/kg paraquat (dissolved in saline) at 2-day intervals for a total of 10 doses. Animals were killed at day 7 or 8 after the last administration as previously described (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Experimental protocols were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Use of Live Animals and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Buck Institute of Age Research. Stereological SN TH-positive Neuron Counts—Littermates were fixed by perfusion as previously described (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Cryostat-cut sections (40 μm) were taken through the entire midbrain. TH-positive neurons were immunolabeled by incubating the tissue sections successively with a rabbit polyclonal anti-TH antibody (1:200) and biotinylated horse anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Vector Laboratories) and following the staining procedure outlined by the manufacturers of Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) in combination with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) reagents. The total number of TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta was counted from four to five littermates per group by using the optical fractionator method, an unbiased stereological technique of cell counting (23West M.J. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), as previously described (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Total protein was isolated from brain tissue as described previously (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a commercially available protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal concentrations of protein extracts were electrophoretically resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Primary antibodies for Western blot analysis were used at the following dilutions: phospho-JNK (1:1000), phospho-c-Jun (1:1000), caspase-3 (1:1000), and β-actin (1:5000). Detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for the number (n) of independent experiments performed. Differences among the means for all experiments described were analyzed using one- or two-way analysis of variance. Newman-Keuls post-hoc analysis was employed when differences were observed by analysis of variance testing (p < 0.05). Protective Effects of EUK Compounds on Paraquat-induced Neurotoxicity in a Dopaminergic Midbrain-derived Rat Cell Line—We used two separate salen manganese complexes, EUK-134 and EUK-189, in this study (Fig. 1). EUK-189 has both SOD and catalase activities equivalent to those of EUK-134 but has increased lipophilicity and neuroprotective activity (20Melov S. Doctrow S.R. Schneider J.A. Haberson J. Patel M. Coskun P.E. Huffman K. Wallace D.C. Malfroy B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8348-8353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N27 is an immortalized dopaminergic neuronal cell line isolated from fetal rat mesencephalic cultures (24Prasad K.N. Carvalho E. Kentroti S. Edwards-Prasad J. Freed C. Vernadakis A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1994; 30A: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The N27 cell line produces dopamine and expresses the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and the dopamine transport (DAT). Recently, we used this cell line as a model to study the potential role of paraquat on the JNK signaling pathway, because it relates to dopaminergic cell death associated with PD (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As previously shown (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), treatment with 400 μm paraquat for 18-24 h increased caspase-3 activation, cell death, and DNA fragmentation compared with untreated control. However, when EUK-134 or EUK-189 (15 or 30 μm) was added 1 h before addition of paraquat, caspase-3 activation, cell death, and DNA fragmentation were all significantly inhibited (Fig. 2). In the case of 30 μm EUK-189, paraquat-mediated increases in caspase-3 activation, cell death, and DNA fragmentation were inhibited by 60%, 85%, and 77%, respectively (Fig. 2). Neither EUK-134 nor EUK-189 at the concentrations used were stimulatory or inhibitory for neuronal survival without paraquat (data not shown).Fig. 2Effects of EUK compounds on paraquat-induced caspase-3 activation and cell death in dopaminergic N27 cells in vitro. N27 cells were treated with EUK-134 or EUK-189 1 h prior to the addition of 400 μm paraquat (PQ). Based on previous studies (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), caspase-3 activity at 18 h (A), cell viability at 24 h (B), and TUNEL-positive cells at 24 h (C-E) were measured.

Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To study whether the effects of the salen manganese complexes were specific for oxidative stress-induced cell death, N27 cells were treated with EUK-134 or EUK-189 (15 or 30 μm) for 1 h prior to treatment with 5 μm lactacystin. Cell death and DNA fragmentation were analyzed by MTT and TUNEL staining methods at 24 h, respectively. As seen in Fig. 3, there was no difference in lactacystin-induced apoptotic death in the absence or presence of EUK compounds. Protective Effects of EUK Compounds on Paraquat-induced Dopaminergic Neurotoxicity in Primary Mesencephalic Cultures Is Due to Inhibition of JNK Pathway Activation—Our previous results suggested that paraquat-generated superoxide may lead to activation of the JNK signaling pathway resulting in subsequent dopaminergic neuronal apoptosis, because these could both be attenuated in vitro by either the SOD mimetic, manganese(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP), or the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To assess the neuroprotective ability of the salen manganese complexes in relation to paraquat-induced cell death on a cellular level in primary dopamine midbrain neurons, we examined the effects of EUK-134 or EUK-189 administration on paraquat-treated primary mesencephalic cultures via dual immunofluorescence with antibodies specific for TH and either phospho-JNK, phospho-c-Jun, or cleaved caspase-3, respectively, coupled with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Cultures were pretreated with EUK-134 (0.5 μm) or EUK-189 (0.5 μm) 1 h prior to treatment with 40 μm paraquat. As shown in Fig. 4A, EUK-134 or EUK-189 both separately reduced the colocalization of phospho-JNK, phospho-c-Jun, and activated caspase-3 with TH-positive neurons after 18 h of paraquat treatment. Cells were next stained for TH at 24 h following paraquat treatment, and TH-positive neurons were counted. Pretreatment with EUK-134 or EUK-189 was found to protect TH-positive neurons from paraquat-induced cell death (Fig. 4B). These data, coupled with our previous findings (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), suggest that the salen manganese complexes attenuate paraquat-induced neuronal cell death via inhibition of JNK activation and c-Jun phosphorylation. EUK-189 Inhibits Paraquat-induced Reduction in TH-positive SNpc Cell Numbers in Vivo via Inhibition of JNK Pathway Activation—To examine whether EUK-189 attenuates the selective loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons after paraquat administration in vivo, we implanted mice with pumps containing either 5% mannitol (as vehicle control) or 15 mm EUK-189 1 day prior to paraquat treatment. As previously demonstrated (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), exposure of mice to paraquat produced a substantial loss of nigral dopamine neurons when compared with unlesioned controls (Fig. 5A). However, subcutaneous administration of the EUK-189 significantly attenuated the loss of nigral dopamine neurons when examined at day 8 following the last paraquat treatment (Fig. 5A). In keeping with previous studies (11McCormack A.L. Thiruchelvam M. Manning-Bog A.B. Thiffault C. Langston J.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. Di Monte D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), stereological analysis revealed that paraquat administration resulted in an ∼29% loss of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) TH-positive neurons compared with saline-treated controls (Fig. 5B). In contrast, paraquat-treated mice that received EUK-189 displayed a significant reduction in the loss of SNpc dopaminergic neurons compared with animals treated paraquat alone (Fig. 5B). Indeed, the number of SNpc TH-positive neurons in EUK-189-treated animals did not significantly differ from saline-treated controls following paraquat administration. To investigate whether inhibition of the JNK apoptotic cascade contributed to the neuroprotection conferred by EUK-189 following paraquat injection, the levels of phospho-JNK, phospho-c-Jun, and cleaved caspase-3 were detected by Western blot analysis of SNpc tissues. As previously demonstrated (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the levels of phosphorylated JNK, phosphorylated c-Jun, and cleaved caspase-3 were all enhanced in SNpc tissues prepared from paraquat-treated mice compared with SNpc tissues prepared from mice in the saline treatment group (Fig. 6). However, pretreatment with EUK-189 completely suppressed the paraquat-induced increase in the levels of phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 6). In the present study, we demonstrate that pretreatment of dopaminergic cultures in vitro or systemic treatment of mice in vivo with synthetic catalytic scavengers of reactive oxygen species, the salen manganese complexes EUK-134 and EUK-189, conferred neuroprotection against selective paraquat-mediated dopaminergic nigral cell death. In vitro and in vivo evidence from both our previous work (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and this current study indicate that these compounds likely attenuate paraquat-induced neuron damage via inhibition of the activation of JNK-mediated apoptosis. With increased understanding both of the mechanisms of oxidative stress and the role of antioxidants, it has become apparent that antioxidant defense systems normally exist in a balance with endogenous reactive oxygen species. Disruption of this balance appears to be one of the major factors involved in the selective neuropathogenesis associated with PD (26Adams Jr., J.D. Chang M.L. Klaidman L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Studies have shown, for example, that the levels of the thiol-reducing agent glutathione decrease within the SN of patients with Parkinson disease (27Perry T.L. Yong V.W. Neurosci.

Some epidemiological investigations have suggested that increased exposure to agricultural chemicals via living in a rural environment, drinking well water, or occupational exposure may be a potential environmental risk factor for the disease (3Hertzman C.

Neurology. 1997; 48: 1583-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Experimental paraquat exposure in vivo causes brain α-synuclein aggregation and formation of Lewy body-like neuronal occlusions (35Manning-Bog A.B. McCormack A.L. Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L.

The mechanisms of neurotoxicity associated with exposure to paraquat are most likely mediated via oxidative stress. Mutations in the DJ-1 gene are linked with autosomal recessive early onset familial form of PD (36Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C. Squitieri F. Ibanez P. Joosse M. van Dongen J.W. Vanacore N. van Swieten J.C. Brice A. Meco G. van Duijn C.M. Oostra B.A. Heutink P. Science. 2003; 299: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar), and paraquat has been shown to oxidize the DJ-1 protein (37Mitsumoto A. Nakagawa Y. Takeuchi A. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Takanezawa Y. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Superoxide anion radicals can be generated by paraquat through both redox cycling via reaction with molecular oxygen and electron transfer reactions with NADH-dependent oxido-reductases (38Bus J.S. Gibson J.E. Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 55: 37-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Clejan L. Cederbaum A.I. Biochem.

Superoxide anion radicals may then be converted to H2O2 via one of the cellular SODs, Mn-SOD in the mitochondria and Cu/Zn-SOD in the cytosol. H2O2 can, in the presence of iron, subsequently undergo conversion to highly reactive and harmful hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction. Catalase or glutathione peroxidase normally catalyzes the breakdown of H2O2 to O2 and H2O. EUK-134 and EUK-189 are mimetics of both superoxide dismutase and catalase and can therefore act to detoxify hydroxyl radicals completely (13Baudry M. Etienne S. Bruce A. Palucki M. Jacobsen E.

In this study, the administration of EUK-134 or EUK-189 prevented paraquat-induced dopaminergic neuron death, suggesting that reactive oxygen species acts upstream in the cell death pathway following exposure to paraquat. Our results clearly indicate that oxidative stress is involved in the selective neuronal cell death of dopaminergic neurons following paraquat treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Activation of the JNK signaling pathway is considered as part of an oxidative stress response in a number of cell types (41Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar, 42Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrate that activation of JNK and c-Jun is increased within the SNpc of paraquat-mediated adult animals and that MnTBAP administration prevents paraquat-induced JNK activation and subsequent dopaminergic apoptosis in vitro (12Peng J. Mao X.O. Stevenson F.F. Hsu M. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32626-32632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, MnTBAP does not cross the blood-brain barrier (43Melov S. Schneider J.A. Day B.J. Hinerfeld D. Coskun P. Mirra S.S. Crapo J.D. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and therefore was not a viable option for assessing the role of oxidative stress in paraquat-induced dopaminergic cell death in vivo. Pretreatment of mice with the bioavailable compound EUK-189 was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun and caspase-3 activation in SNpc dopaminergic neurons in agreement with our previous in vitro experiment data, suggesting that EUK-189 can cross the blood-brain barrier and attenuate dopaminergic nigral cell death. Chronic systemic administration of EUK-189 was previously found to significantly decrease in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in the aging brain and to reverse age-related learning impairment (21Liu R. Liu I.Y. Bi X. Thompson R.F. Doctrow S.R. Malfroy B. Baudry M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8526-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). EUKs have previously proven to be effective against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine-mediated toxicity at least in vitro, and we now demonstrate that they are protective in vivo in a second model of the disease, paraquat intoxication. This suggests a common mechanism of action, i.e. oxidative stress, in selective dopaminergic SN neurodegeneration associated with two separate models of the disease. Together, our data provide direct evidence that systemic administration of bioavailable synthetic SOD/catalase mimetics protects against selective paraquat-mediated dopaminergic neuronal cell death through mechanisms involving the elimination of oxidative damage and the modulation of signal transduction pathways. Given the potential for exposure to this herbicide to increase the risk for the development of PD and the recent establishment of its systemic administration as a viable model for the disease, this has obvious therapeutic implications. We are grateful to Lin Xie for advice on immunohistochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2032359476,"The massive earthquake that struck off the west coast of Sumatra on 28 March, causing fears of another tsunami disaster, is confirmed as a rupture of the Sunda megathrust triggered by the December event. The latest maps of stress distribution indicate that the greatest risk of renewed seismicity on the Sunda megathrust is in the section near the Mentawai islands: history suggests that a tsunami is a possibility. On 28 March 2005 the Sunda megathrust in Indonesia ruptured again, producing another great earthquake three months after the previous one. The rupture was contiguous with that of the December 2004 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake, and is likely to have been sparked by local stress, although the triggering stresses at its hypocentre were very small — of the order of just 0.1 bar. Calculations show that stresses imposed by the second rupture have brought closer to failure the megathrust immediately to the south, under the Batu and Mentawai islands, and have expanded the area of increased stress on the Sumatra fault. Palaeoseismologic studies show that the Mentawai segment of the Sunda megathrust is well advanced in its seismic cycle and is therefore a good candidate for triggered failure."

The purpose of the present study was to better understand the mechanism of extracellular transport of MYOC in trabecular meshwork cells. Using a biochemical approach, we found that MYOC localizes intracellularly to both the cytosolic and particulate fractions. When intracellular membranes were separated over a linear sucrose gradient, MYOC equilibrated in a fraction less dense than traditional secretory vesicles and lysosomes. In pulse-labeling experiments that followed nascent MYOC over time, the characteristic doublet observed for MYOC by SDS-PAGE did not change, even in the presence of brefeldin A; indicating that MYOC is not glycosylated and is not released via a traditional secretory mechanism. When conditioned media from human trabecular meshwork cells were examined, both native and recombinant MYOC associated with an extracellular membrane population having biochemical characteristics of exosomes, and containing the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen, HLA-DR.

In the present study, we investigate the method of release of MYOC from TM cells in an effort to better understand its function. Our results demonstrate that release of MYOC from TM cells is unlike the mode of release observed for two control proteins that use a conventional secretory mechanism. Moreover, results indicate that MYOC is released from TM cells in association with lipids, from which MYOC dissociates in the medium. We suggest that MYOC is released from TM cells on the outside surface of lipid particles that display biochemical characteristics consistent with exosomes, and which carry an exosome “marker” protein, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (as HLA-DR). Our results also indicate a mechanism by which tissue-specific localization and pathology of MYOC is achieved, and suggests that, in most cells, MYOC is an intracellular protein, but is released with exosomes by the TM. Previously characterized human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cell strains HTM26, HTM29, HTM84, HTM85, HTM86, and HTM90 were isolated and cultured in our laboratory as described (30Snyder R.W. Stamer W.D.

Cells (passage 2–4) were grown to confluence and maintained for at least 7 days in low glucose Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), glutamine (0.29 mg/ml) solution (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) before experimentation. Prior to addition to culture medium, fetal bovine serum was centrifuged at 141,000 × gmax for 60 min in an SW27 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) to remove any particulate material. MCF7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured as described, except that cell cultures were utilized prior to confluence (at ∼70–80% confluence) and were never allowed to reach confluence. For experiments analyzing recombinant proteins, HTM cell cultures were seeded, and 5–7 days later cells were infected with a replication-deficient adenovirus (AV) that contained the coding sequence for β-galactosidase or MYOC at a multiplicity of infection of ∼1 (32Stamer W.D. Peppel K. O'Donnell M.E. Roberts B.C. Wu F. Epstein D.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1803-1811PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were utilized 3–5 days postinfection. For experiments examining HLA-DR expression in HTM cell cultures and conditioned medium, confluent cells were maintained in supplemented DMEM as before, with the addition of 500 units/ml interferon-γ (IFNγ) for at least 5 days prior to experimentation. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal rabbit anti-myocilin primary antibodies were produced in and characterized previously by our laboratory (11Stamer W.D. Roberts B.C. Howell D.N. Epstein D.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1804-1812PubMed Google Scholar). All other antibodies were purchased commercially and used at the indicated dilutions: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-tissue plasminogen activator (1:1000, Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Ontario, Canada), monoclonal anti-β-actin (1:5000, Sigma), monoclonal anti-CD107a (LAMP1) (1:1000, BD Pharmingen), monoclonal anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit II (1:1000, Molecular Probes), monoclonal anti-Golgi 58K protein (1: 1000, Sigma), monoclonal anti-histone deacetylase 2 (1:1000, Sigma), polyclonal rabbit anti-cyclophilin B (1:000, Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), and monoclonal anti-HLA-DR α chain (1:1000, DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). All horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). For Western blotting, proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Primary antibodies were added, and blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Membranes were washed in TBS-T (4 times for 15 min) and, with the exception of the one conjugated primary antibody, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in TBS-T containing 5% milk and washed with TBS-T as before. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) on x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Where indicated, proteins were quantified in the linear range of the film by densitometry using a bioimaging system and LabWorks4 software (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). For silver staining, proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized using a Bio-Rad silver stain kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures of confluent HTM cells (incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm dexamethasone for 7 days) or subconfluent MCF7 cells were transferred to and maintained in low serum DMEM (either 1 or 0.5% fetal bovine serum) for 48 h. Conditioned medium was collected, and cells were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and placed on ice. Cells and conditioned medium were processed separately. Cells—The cells were scraped into and lysed by a hypotonic buffer (5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.45, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics Corp.)) and homogenized using three strokes of a Dounce. Lysates were only crudely homogenized (3 strokes) to facilitate the clean separation of secretory vesicles from other cellular components. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min (giving nuclei and large organelles in pellet) using an FA 45-30-11 rotor (Brinkmann, Westbury, NY). Supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and centrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 60 min (giving membranes and vesicles in pellet) using a 50Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). The resulting supernatant (considered cytosol) was recentrifuged at 100,000 × gav, and pellets were resuspended in PBS and repelleted, to eliminate crossover contamination. Cytosol was combined with Laemmli sample buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 5–10 min at 100 °C. Pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer, solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer, and incubated as described. Conditioned Medium—The medium was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min in an A4-44 rotor (Brinkmann) to remove dead cells and debris, and supernatant was combined with reducing Laemmli sample buffer and incubated for 5–10 min at 100 °C. Confluent HTM cell monolayers were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1.5 h, followed by 30 min in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. Cells were washed 3 times for 10 min each in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer and postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 1 h. Samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in Epox 812 resin. Thin sections were cut on a Reichert ultracut E ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined on a Philips CM20 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Untreated confluent HTM cells were lysed, scraped, and homogenized as described above. Cell lysates were centrifuged first at 1,000 × g (FA 45-30-11 rotor) for 1 min to pellet nuclei. Then, supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and centrifuged at 100,000 × gav (50Ti rotor) for 60 min to isolate cellular membranes. Cellular membrane pellets were resuspended in PBS and repelleted to remove potential cytosolic contamination. Pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of Hanks' PBS (Invitrogen) and layered into linear sucrose gradients (0–2 m sucrose in Hanks' PBS). Gradients were centrifuged at 38,000 × gav for 3 h in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Fractions were taken from the top of the gradient and analyzed for sucrose content with a refractometer. Samples were tested for protein distribution by silver stain and Western blot analyses. Two prominent bands observed in silver-stained gels were excised and digested with trypsin. Sequence of protein fragments was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization qualitative time-of-flight mass spectrometry:mass spectrometry (Proteomics Core Facility, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona). Protein identity and coverage was determined using SEQUEST software. Extracellular membranes were isolated from the conditioned medium of confluent HTM cells (with or without prior adenoviral infection, or with or without IFNγ treatment) by differential centrifugation as described for the isolation of exosomes (34Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Liejendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). Medium was centrifuged first at 10,000 × gav (SW41 or SW28 rotor) for 60 min to isolate dead cells and cellular debris. Supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 60 min to isolate extracellular membranes using SW41 or SW28 rotors. Pellets were resuspended in PBS, repelleted (to control for non-membranous protein trapping), and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples of conditioned medium, pre- and post-centrifugation, were combined with reducing Laemmli sample buffer. To control for sticking, post-centrifugation medium was recentrifuged at 100,000 × gav (SW41 or SW28 rotors) for 60 min, resuspended in PBS, and repelleted as described. Non-visible pellets were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer as described. Pellets and medium (and samples of purification medium as controls) were combined with Laemmli buffer, and incubated as described. For gradient isolation, purified extracellular membrane pellets were pooled and resuspended in 1 ml of 2.6 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. Linear sucrose gradients (2 to 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) were layered over membrane preparations, and gradients were centrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 15 h in an SW41 rotor. Equal fractions were taken sequentially from the top of the gradient, sucrose concentrations were analyzed with a refractometer, and samples were solubilized in Laemmli buffer as described. Human TM cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well. Five to 7 days later, cells were infected as described above. Three to 5 days post-infection, cells in each well were first washed with (3 × 1 ml), then cultured in 1 ml of methionine/cysteine (Met/Cys)-free DMEM (Invitrogen Corp). After 30 min, Met/Cys-free DMEM was removed and replaced with 1 ml of Met/Cys-free DMEM containing 300 μCi/ml of [35S]Met/Cys (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Following a 30-min labeling period, cells were washed with (2 × 1 ml), then changed into 1 ml of DMEM containing a 10 times concentration of Met/Cys for 1, 2, 4, or 6 h. After collection and placement of conditioned medium from metabolic labeling assays on ice, labeled human TM cells were placed on ice and washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, pH 7.5, and scraped into 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, protease inhibitor mixture, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were homogenized using 4 strokes in a glass Dounce and cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants and conditioned media were pre-cleared with protein A-agarose (Pierce Biotechnology) for 2 h with rotation at 4 °C (or conditioned media were processed separately as described for the isolation of extracellular membranes). Beads were pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min), and supernatants were transferred to tubes containing 2 μg of anti-green fluorescent protein or anti-MYOC IgG and incubated at 4 °C. After 12 h, IgG-protein complexes were captured by addition of 50 μl of protein A-agarose and incubation for 2 h with rotation at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer. Captured proteins were denatured by boiling in Laemmli buffer for 10 min and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose electrophoretically, and labeled proteins were visualized by exposure to x-ray film for 24–72 h at –80 °C. Human TM cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates and infected with AV as described above. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for a 30-min period, and were either treated with 1 μg/ml brefeldin A or left untreated. Cells were either lysed and lysates collected at time zero, or were cultured for 4 h in DMEM containing a 10 times concentration of Met/Cys, then cells were lysed, and conditioned medium was collected. In treated cells, brefeldin A was supplemented at 1 μg/ml for the chase period. Medium and lysates were immunoprecipitated with nonspecific (anti-green fluorescent protein), anti-MYOC, or anti-alkaline phosphatase antibodies as described above. Proteolysis experiments were performed on purified extracellular membrane pellets. Conditioned medium (with dead cells and debris removed) was split equally in two, centrifuged at 100,000 × gav (SW41 or SW28 rotor), and extracellular membranes were purified as previously described. Pellets were resuspended in purified water containing proteinase K (7 mm Proteinase K, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide) or were resuspended in purified water with 10 mm EDTA and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, then solubilized in Laemmli buffer and incubated at 100 °C for 10 min. Cellular Distribution of MYOC—Based on the apparent disparity between the localization of MYOC in HTM cells (intracellular and extracellular) versus other cell types (intracellular only), we were interested in addressing two issues: first, whether trafficking of MYOC differed from conventional secretory proteins, and, second, if dexamethasone treatment of HTM cells altered the cellular and extracellular distribution of MYOC (dexamethasone treatment uniquely induces MYOC expression in HTM cells, and thus enables positive identification of HTM cells; Fig. 1). To assess the subcellular localization of MYOC in HTM cell lysates and medium, we cultured confluent HTM cells in the presence or absence of dexamethasone, collected medium, and lysed and homogenized cells. Cells were only crudely homogenized (see “Experimental Procedures”) to facilitate the clean separation of secretory vesicles from large membrane-bound organelles. MCF7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) cells also express native MYOC and were used as a control. We utilized sequential differential centrifugation to separate cellular constituents into cytosol, nuclei/large organelles, and plasma membranes/vesicles. Fractions were analyzed for the presence of MYOC by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and further analyzed for the presence of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; secretory protein control), organelle-specific markers (to verify fractionation), and β-actin (cytoplasmic marker). Results showed that dexamethasone treatment of HTM cells increased the expression of MYOC in all fractions, and that MYOC was localized to both cytosolic and membrane fractions, plus appeared in conditioned medium. Lactate dehydrogenase assays verified that cell death was not responsible for MYOC appearance in conditioned medium (n = 3; data not shown). Clean partitioning of fractions was verified using antibodies to a nuclear marker (histone deacetylase 2), a mitochondria marker (cytochrome oxidase subunit II), and a Golgi marker (Golgi 58K). In addition to marking traditional secretory vesicles, tPA was used to verify that cytosol was not contaminated with vesicle contents. In contrast to MYOC, tPA was found associated only with intracellular membranes and was excluded from the cytosol. Furthermore, tPA was down-regulated after dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 1A); consistent with a previous report (30Snyder R.W. Stamer W.D. Kramer T.R. Seftor R.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Whereas the intracellular distribution was similar in the two cell types, MYOC was not detected in conditioned medium of MCF7 cells (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, intracellular MYOC structures in MCF7 cells label in a punctate pattern by immunofluorescence microscopy, similar to intracellular labeling of MYOC in HTM cells (data not shown) (11Stamer W.D. Roberts B.C. Howell D.N. Epstein D.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1804-1812PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of tPA in MCF7 cell culture medium verified that the normal secretory pathway was functional, and confirmed that the extracellular localization of MYOC in HTM cells is different than another cell type expressing native MYOC. Taken together, MYOC in MCF7 cells most likely associates with a population of vesicles that is not shed in the same manner as in HTM cells. Analysis of Intracellular Membranes—Despite a difference in cytosolic localization for MYOC and tPA, both proteins were observed to sediment with intracellular membranes. Thus we were"

It was suggested that BcrCBs was a membrane-spanning domain of an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter involved in bacitracin resistance. However, we hypothesized that this protein has an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UPP) phosphatase activity able to compete with bacitracin for UPP. We found that overexpression of a recombinant His6-BcrCBs protein in E. coli (i) increased the resistance of the cells to bacitracin and (ii) increased UPP phosphatase activity in membrane preparations by 600-fold. We solubilized and prepared an electrophoretically pure protein exhibiting a strong UPP phosphatase activity. BcrCBs, which belongs to the type 2 phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP2) phosphatase superfamily (PF01569), differs totally from the already known BacA UPP phosphatase from E. coli, a member of the PF02673 family of the Protein family (Pfam) database. Thus, BcrCBs and its orthologs form a new class of proteins within the PAP2 phosphatase superfamily, and likely all of them share a UPP phosphatase activity.

Bacitracin, a mixture of related cyclic polypeptides, is a powerful antibiotic that strongly binds as a complex with metallic ions to undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UPP), 1The abbreviations used are: UPP, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate; UP, undecaprenyl phosphate; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; ABC, ATP binding cassette; PAP2, type 2 phosphatidic acid phosphatase; Pfam, Protein family. 1The abbreviations used are: UPP, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate; UP, undecaprenyl phosphate; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; ABC, ATP binding cassette; PAP2, type 2 phosphatidic acid phosphatase; Pfam, Protein family.

Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 767-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UP is a lipid carrier that is essential for the synthesis of many cell wall polymers and, more specially, for peptidoglycan biosynthesis. By sequestrating UPP and preventing its dephosphorylation back into UP, bacitracin weakens UP loading or reloading with peptidoglycan precursors. Because translocation of these precursors to the external side of the membrane is drastically or totally impaired, further biosynthesis of the constituents of the cell envelope is stopped, eventually resulting in cell death. Bacitracin is produced by several species of Bacillus such as Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis. Both in the B. licheniformis bacitracin-producing strains and in the B. subtilis naturally resistant non-producing strains, resistance to the antibiotic is ensured by an efficient specific ABC export system (3Podlesek Z.

This bacterium has at least two different and independent bacitracin resistance systems, both belonging to the bacitracin regulon (5Mascher T. Margulis N.G. Wang T. Ye R.W. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The first, an ABC exporter (family 9 (7Quentin Y. Fichant G. Denizot F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 467-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)), is encoded by the bceABBs operon, the expression of which is strongly induced by bacitracin via a classical two-component system, BceRSBs (5Mascher T. Margulis N.G. Wang T. Ye R.W. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 6Bernard R. Joseph P. Guiseppi A. Chippaux M. Denizot F. FEMS Microbiol.

Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After the addition of the antibiotic, the response regulator triggers the transcription of the bceABBs genes, probably strongly increasing the ABC protein level in the membrane. The putative transporter of ABC type, BceABBs, causes most of the resistance of the cells to bacitracin. When it is lacking, the IC50 of the cells decreases from 251 to 6 μm (6Bernard R. Joseph P. Guiseppi A. Chippaux M. Denizot F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 228: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The second system, BcrCBs (YwoA), is similar to BcrCBl from B. licheniformis (3Podlesek Z. Comino A. Herzog-Velikonja B. Zgur-Bertok D. Komel R. Grabnar M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and to BcrCEc from Escherichia coli (9Harel Y.M. Bailone A. Bibi E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6176-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are involved in bacitracin resistance. BcrCBs is encoded by the bcrCBs (ywoA) structural gene and also participates, but to a lesser extent than BceABBs, in the B. subtilis resistance to bacitracin. When BcrCBs is lacking, the IC50 of the cells decreases from 251 to 31 μm (6Bernard R. Joseph P. Guiseppi A. Chippaux M. Denizot F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 228: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The expression of the bcrCBs gene is also controlled by bacitracin but does not depend on the BceRS two-component system (6Bernard R. Joseph P. Guiseppi A. Chippaux M. Denizot F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 228: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism of induction by bacitracin is not clear, it depends on σM, σX, and both σW and its cognate anti-σ, RsiW (4Ohki R. Tateno K. Okada Y. Okajima H. Asai K. Sadaie Y.

BcrCBl was formerly classified as a putative membrane-spanning domain of an ABC transporter (3Podlesek Z. Comino A. Herzog-Velikonja B. Zgur-Bertok D. Komel R. Grabnar M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Accordingly, BcrC orthologs, which all have at least four putative transmembrane domains, have been annotated in databases as putative membrane proteins. Their predicted functions go from unknown to bacitracin transporter. All, however, also belong to the PF01569 Pfam family of PAP2 phosphatases, which contains more than 600 proteins. Some members of this family, but no BcrC orthologs, have a demonstrated phosphatase activity. This is the case, for instance, for PhoC from Morganella morganii (11Thaller M.C. Berlutti F. Schippa S. Lombardi G. Rossolini G.M. Microbiology (Read.). 1994; 140: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and Zymomonas mobilis (12Pond J.L. Eddy C.K. Mackenzie K.F. Conway T. Borecky D.J.

Lett. 2003; 228: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that such might also be the case for the BcrCBs protein and that its true function would be to dephosphorylate UPP. To test these hypotheses, we purified and characterized the BcrCBs protein from B. subtilis. We showed that BcrCBs has UPP phosphatase activity and that it is probably not involved in an ABC transport system.

Microbiology (N.Y.). 2004; 150: 2609-2617PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting mixture was used to transform either the DH5α or the C41(DE3) strain. In each case, the sequence inserted in the recombinant plasmid was checked by DNA sequencing. Preparation of Membrane Fraction and Purification of the BcrCBs Protein—E. coli C41(DE3) cells carrying the pET22-Pml-bcrCBs plasmid were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (1-liter culture). When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for 4 h. Cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation, washed twice with 10 ml of cold 50 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride buffer, pH 8, supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell pellet was suspended in 10 ml of the same buffer, and the cells were lysed, in the cold, by two successive passages through a French pressure cell (16,000 p.s.i.). Cold 500 mm EDTA (500 μl), pH 8, was added to the resulting suspension and submitted to a 30-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm final concentration) was added to the resulting supernatant (crude extract) and then submitted to a 90-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended and solubilized by n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) (0.9%, w/v) following all the steps described by El Ghachi et al. (22El Ghachi M. Bouhss A. Blanot D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30106-30113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The BcrCBs purification involved a final affinity step with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate agarose (Ni2+-NTA agarose, from Qiagen) using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Bacitracin Sensitivity Assay—The concentration of bacitracin leading to 50% of growth inhibition (IC50) was determined using the microtiter tray assay described by Ohki et al. (4Ohki R. Tateno K. Okada Y. Okajima H. Asai K. Sadaie Y. Murata M. Aiso T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). UPP Phosphatase Assay—UPP phosphatase activity of biological samples was determined as described previously (22El Ghachi M. Bouhss A. Blanot D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol.

Bioinformatic Analysis—Transmembrane domains in proteins were searched through the TMHMM program (23Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Blast (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59441) Google Scholar) searches on B. subtilis were done on the SubtiList data base (25Moszer I. Glaser P. Danchin A. Microbiology (N.Y.). 1995; 141: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Membership to a particular Pfam family (26Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) was defined using the Pfam database. Reserpine Does Not Affect BcrCBs Functioning—The plant alkaloid reserpine is a powerful inhibitor of both mammalian and Gram-positive bacterial efflux systems, and its inhibitory effect on bacteria ABC transporters is well documented (27Choudhuri B.S. Bhakta S. Barik R. Basu J. Kundu M. Chakrabarti P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Pasca M.R. Guglierame P. Arcesi F. Bellinzoni M. De Rossi E. Riccardi G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3175-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the addition of reserpine (at sublethal concentration) during bacterial growth should drastically decrease the bacitracin resistance of the cells if this resistance is mostly due to an ABC transporter. If it is not, almost no effect should be observed. As shown in Fig. 1, the addition of reserpine to a culture of the B. subtilis 168 parental strain resulted in a 16-fold decrease in the cellular IC50 for bacitracin, indicating that at least one system is strongly inhibited. Similarly, when the BcrCBs– BSmrs173 mutant in which only the putative ABC transporter BceABBs system is functional was grown in the presence of reserpine, the IC50 of the cells was again dramatically decreased (18-fold). Inversely, reserpine had only a slight effect (less than 2-fold) on the IC50 of the BceABBs– BFS82 mutant in which the resistance to bacitracin depends only on the BcrCBs system. Together, these results indicated that reserpine (i) inhibits the functioning of the BceABBs involved in B. subtilis resistance but (ii) does not affect that of BcrCBs, making it very unlikely for this protein to be involved as a membrane-spanning domain partner in an ABC transporter. Overexpression of BcrCBs Allows B. subtilis and E. coli to Stand Higher Concentrations of Bacitracin—When the pDG148-Stu-bcrCBs overexpression plasmid was introduced into DH5α or C41(DE3) strain, the IC50 of the cells for bacitracin increased 3-fold in cells grown with 1 mm IPTG (data not shown). This increase indicates that the BcrCBs protein is also active in E. coli and that it allows the cell to resist to higher concentrations of the antibiotic. As shown on Fig. 2, when the pDG148-Stu-bcrCBs plasmid was introduced into the B. subtilis bcrCBs bceABs double mutant, the resistance to bacitracin of the mutant increased 8-fold; the IC50 of the cells rose from 0.9 to 7.4 μm. A similar increase was observed with the B. subtilis bcrCBs mutant (IC50 rose from 31 to 420 μm). All these data indicated that the native BcrCBs protein can participate in the resistance to bacitracin in B. subtilis and in E. coli. The bcrCBs coding sequence was then cloned into a modified version of the pET22-Pml expression vector (21Joseph P. Guiseppi A. Sorokin A. Denizot F. Microbiology (N.Y.). 2004; 150: 2609-2617PubMed Google Scholar) immediately downstream from the His6 tag coding sequence carried by the vector, leading to plasmid pET22-Pml-bcrCBs. In this construction, expression of the gene fusion encoding a His6-BcrCBs hybrid protein is controlled by the addition of IPTG. After growth in the presence of IPTG of the C41(DE3)/pET22-Pml-bcrCBs strain, the IC50 of the cells for bacitracin increased from 1.4 to 5.6 mm, indicating that this hybrid protein is active (data not shown). Overexpression of BcrCBs Increases UPP Phosphatase Activity—The E. coli C41(DE3) cells harboring plasmid pET22-Pml-bcrCBs were grown without IPTG to be used as control cells or with 1 mm IPTG to overproduce the His6-BcrCBs protein for further studies. Crude extracts and membrane fractions prepared from these cells, as indicated under “Materials and Methods,” were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue staining of the gel (Fig. 3, lanes 1–3) showed a broad band corresponding to a protein species of about 22 kDa, the size expected for the His6-BcrCBs hybrid protein, in the membrane fraction of the cells in which the expression of the gene had been induced by IPTG. Scanning of the stained gel indicated that this band represented almost 41% of all membrane proteins. In contrast, no such band was detected in the soluble fraction of the same cells or in soluble fractions of the cells grown without IPTG (data not shown). There was, however, a faint band at the same position in the crude extract of non-induced cells, probably due to a leakage of the promoter controlling the T7 polymerase expression (Fig. 3, lane 1). The identification of this ∼22-kDa protein species with the His6-BcrCBs protein was confirmed by Western blot detection using antibodies directed against the His6 tag. As expected, no signal could be detected in the other soluble fractions (see above), indicating that the His6-BcrCBs hybrid protein is totally inserted in the membrane (data not shown). Although this protein seemed to be present in the membrane of the non-induced control cells, it was not detected by the antibody, probably because it has a low affinity for the His tag. UPP phosphatase activity was then determined as described previously (22El Ghachi M. Bouhss A. Blanot D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30106-30113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) in membrane fractions originating from control cells and from cells overproducing the His6-BcrCBs protein. The membrane fraction from the non-induced C41(DE3)/pET22-Pml-bcrCBs cells already has UPP phosphatase activity, which reaches 13.5 ± 0.5 nmol of UPP transformed per minute and per mg of protein (nmol min–1 mg–1). This level was higher than that found (0.3 nmol min–1 mg–1) in a membrane preparation from the C43(DE3) E. coli strain containing the plasmid without insert, and it probably reflects a leakage of the T7 polymerase promoter that controls the expression of the inserted gene in the pET22-Pml plasmid. As expected, however, a much higher level of UPP phosphatase activity, up to 198 ± 9 nmol min–1 mg–1 (a 660-fold increase), was observed in the membrane fraction originating from the C41(DE3)/pET22-Pml-bcrCBs cells in which expression of the tagged BcrCBs protein had been induced. This observation strongly supported the hypothesis that the BcrCBs protein has UPP phosphatase activity. Accounting for the very low basal level of UPP phosphatase activity in E. coli cell membranes (0.3 nmol min–1 mg–1), His6-BcrCBs corresponds to almost all the activity detected in the membrane preparation coming from the induced cells. In this fraction in which the His6-BcrCBs protein represents 41 ± 1% of all proteins, the specific activity of the pure membrane-embedded His6-BcrCBs protein can be estimated to be greater than 450 nmol min–1 mg–1. Purified BcrCBs Protein Displays UPP Phosphatase Activity—The detergent DM is efficient for extracting the BacAEc protein from membranes of E. coli cells (22El Ghachi M. Bouhss A. Blanot D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30106-30113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the membrane fractions originating from the C41(DE3)/pET22-Pml-bcrCBs cells overproducing or not the His6-BcrCBs protein were subjected to four successive extraction treatments with DM, leading to fractions DM1–4. SDS-PAGE analysis of each fraction followed by Coomassie Blue staining and scanning of the gel indicated that up to 93% of the membrane proteins were recovered in fractions DM1 and DM2 (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). The His6-BcrCBs protein was observed in the DM1 and DM2 fractions but not in the DM3 and DM4 fractions. Scanning of the Coomassie Blue stained gel indicated that the His6-BcrCBs protein, if alone in the 22-kDa band, represented 49 ± 1% of the proteins of fraction DM1. The UPP phosphatase activity of this fraction reached 230 ± 18 nmol min–1 mg–1 (Table III). Thus, because the estimated specific activities of the His6-BcrCBs protein before and after DM extraction were similar, the protein is apparently not damaged during this extraction step.Table IIIUPP-phosphatase activity of fractions obtained during His6-BcrCBs purificationProtein amountsaProtein amounts were determined using Bradford (Bio-Rad) and/or BCA (Sigma) kits.

Open table in a new tab 6.7 mg of proteins (supposedly containing 3.3 mg of the His6-BcrCBs protein, Table III) from the DM1 fraction was subjected to Ni2+-NTA agarose purification. Each fraction (flow-through, washes, and elutions with imidazole) was then analyzed for its protein content by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4) and Western blot analysis (data not shown). 4.7 mg of proteins (supposedly containing 1.9 mg of the His6-BcrCBs protein, Table III) was recovered in the flow-through, washes, and 10 mm imidazole pooled fraction. Thus, almost 58% of the His6-BcrCBs protein was not retained on the Ni2+-NTA agarose column, explaining the very poor yield of His6-BcrCBs purification. This might be due to a low affinity of the His6-BcrC protein for Ni2+-NTA in the presence of n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The His6-BcrCBs protein was detected in the 30, 60, and 80 mm imidazole fractions (0.2, 0.32, and 0.56 mg, respectively; Table III). Unfortunately, all these fractions contained some contaminant proteins as judged on SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 4). Only the last elution fraction done with 300 mm imidazole showed a single band corresponding to the His6-BcrCBs protein (Fig. 4) and allowed us to recover about 0.12 mg of protein. Determination of its UPP phosphatase activity indicated that it has a specific activity of 730 ± 60 nmol min–1 mg–1 (Table III). When comparing our purification procedure to that used for BacAEc (see “Materials and Methods”), it appeared that the additional low speed centrifugation step greatly facilitates the action of the mild detergent used to extract the proteins from membranes.

Treatment of LLC-PK1 cells with the model nephrotoxicant 1,2-(dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC) resulted in a >1.5-fold up- and down-regulation of 14 and 9 proteins, respectively, preceding the onset of apoptosis. Proteins included those involved in metabolism, i.e. aconitase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, and those related to stress responses and cytoskeletal reorganization, i.e. cofilin, Hsp27, and α-b-crystallin. The most prominent changes were found for Hsp27, which was related to a pI shift in association with an altered phosphorylation status of serine residue 82. Although both p38 and JNK were activated by DCVC, only inhibition of p38 with SB203580 reduced Hsp27 phosphorylation, which was associated with accelerated reorganization of focal adhesions, cell detachment, and apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of JNK with SP600125 maintained cell adhesion as well as protection against apoptosis. Active JNK co-localized at focal adhesions after DCVC treatment in a FAK-dependent manner. Inhibition of active JNK localization at focal adhesions did not prevent DCVC-induced phosphorylation of Hsp27. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective mutant Hsp27 acted as a dominant negative and accelerated the DCVC-induced changes in the focal adhesions as well as the onset of apoptosis. Our data fit a model whereby early p38 activation results in a rapid phosphorylation of Hsp27, a requirement for proper maintenance of cell adhesion, thus suppressing renal epithelial cell apoptosis.

Acute renal failure, caused by either ischemia/reperfusion injury or exposure to nephrotoxic xenobiotics, is still an important clinical problem.

There is increasing evidence that sublethal PTC injury results in changes in cell adhesion at the level of cellular to extracellular matrix interactions at focal adhesions (1Molitoris B.A. Marrs J. Am. J. Med. 1999; 106: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These interactions are under the tight control of dynamic changes of the F-actin cytoskeleton. Likewise, changes in the cellular interactions after sublethal PTC injury are generally associated with altered F-actin organization. Therefore, it is important to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the F-actin cytoskeleton and impaired cell adhesion after sublethal PTC injury. Focal adhesions are the closest contact sites between cells and the extracellular matrix. Focal adhesions are formed by a complex network of cytoskeletal, adapter, and signaling proteins. These include both structural (adapter) proteins such as paxillin, talin, vinculin, and p130 Cas, and protein-tyrosine kinases such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Pyk2, and Src, as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members JNK and ERK. These proteins form a direct link between the integrin cell adhesion receptors and the F-actin network. Signaling mediated by the focal adhesion protein complex is essential in various cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and survival. In vitro studies in freshly isolated tubules as well as primary cultured renal PTC and renal cell lines indicate an essential role of focal adhesion-mediated signaling in the molecular mechanism of PTC injury, which involves disruption of the focal adhesions and a reorganization of the F-actin network (2Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Roeser N.F. Senter R.A. Nissim I. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 2153-2164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cellular stress results in activation of MAPK family members. Because these kinases also localize at focal adhesions, the possibility exists that the disturbances in cell adhesions after PTC injury are in part because of activation of these kinases. So far, such a role of MAPKs has not been studied. The family of MAPKs consists of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), which can be activated downstream of the growth factor receptor kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 MAPK that are particularly responsive to cellular stress conditions such as reactive oxygen species, heat shock, and DNA damage (3Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3490) Google Scholar). JNK and p38 have been implicated in the cellular stress signaling in the kidney after acute renal cell injury. Renal ischemia/reperfusion causes activation of JNK, p38, and ERK (4DiMari J. Megyesi J. Udvarhelyi N. Price P. Davis R. Safirstein R. Am. J.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1129-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Also a variety of nephrotoxicants causes the activation of JNK and p38 (7Hayakawa J. Depatie C. Ohmichi M. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20582-20592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Dong J. Ramachandiran S. Tikoo K. Jia Z. Lau S.S. Monks T.J. Am. J.

In vitro as well as in vivo studies using either antisense or pharmacological inhibitors suggest that sustained activation of JNK after PTC injury promotes cell death (5Kunduzova O.R. Bianchi P.

Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, sub-lethal PTC injury that results in pre-conditioning prevents the activation of JNK and p38 after an additional ischemia/reperfusion insult (11Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 12Park K.M. Kramers C. Vayssier-Taussat M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Although these data indicate that JNK activation promotes cell death, the role of p38 activation in the control of PTC apoptosis is largely unknown. Moreover, the exact mechanism by which JNK and p38 affect PTC cell death is unclear. Both JNK and p38 phosphorylate various transcription factors thereby affecting gene expression and ultimately the protein expression (13Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1028-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Alternatively, JNK and p38 (in)directly cause post-translational modification of other cellular proteins, which may also affect the biological outcome of the cellular stress response. For example, JNK can phosphorylate the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, thereby sensitizing cells for apoptosis (17Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 18Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Alternatively, localization of JNK at focal adhesion may result in the phosphorylation of FA-associated proteins such as paxillin, thereby affecting focal adhesion turnover and cell adhesion (19Huang C. Rajfur Z. Borchers C. Schaller M.D. Jacobson K. Nature. 2003; 424: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In addition, p38 MAPKs activate the MAP-KAP kinase 2, which phosphorylates other downstream targets, including small heat shock proteins such as Hsp27. Hsp27 and related proteins are known to affect the actin organization as well as cell death, but their role in nephrotoxicant-induced cell death is as yet unclear. To study PTC injury, we use 1,2-dichlorovinyl-l-cysteine (DCVC), which belongs to the group of nephrotoxic halogenated alkene S-cysteine conjugates (20van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J.

Pharmacol. 1989; 100: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Several characteristics of DCVC make this an ideal model compound to study molecular mechanisms of nephrotoxicity. DCVC is specifically taken up by renal proximal tubular cells both in vitro and in vivo where it is bio-activated by the renal cysteine conjugate β-lyase activity, resulting in the formation of reactive intermediates that cause cell injury (23Chen J.C. Stevens J.L. Trifillis A.L. Jones T.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1990; 103: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Stevens J.L. Robbins J.D. Byrd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15529-15537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PTC injury is associated with loss of focal adhesions and cell adhesion, which is followed by caspase activation and the onset of apoptosis (20van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13328-13337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Gailit J. Colflesh D. Rabiner I. Simone J. Goligorsky M.S. Am. J.

Focal adhesion-mediated signaling seems to be an important component in the control of DCVC-induced apoptosis, because DCVC causes the loss of FAK phosphorylation and thereby activity and promotes the loss of focal adhesion organization (28van de Water B. Houtepen F. Huigsloot M. Tijdens I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36183-36193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). JNK and p38 are also activated upon DCVC treatment. This allowed us to study further the role and potential mechanism of these stress kinases in the control of cellular stress-induced loss of PTC adhesion in relation to the onset of apoptosis. In the present study, we have used a proteomics approach using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) (29Unlu M. Morgan M.E. Minden J.S. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2071-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar, 30Gharbi S. Gaffney P. Yang A. Zvelebil M.J. Cramer R. Waterfield M.D. Timms J.F. Mol. Cell.

Hsp27 was identified as the most prominent early modified protein in the cellular stress response after DCVC treatment of renal epithelial cells. This modification is related to a p38-dependent phosphorylation of Hsp27. Both p38 activity and the phosphorylation of Hsp27 are implicated in the protection of renal epithelial cells against a reorganization of focal adhesions, activation of caspases, and the onset of apoptosis caused by nephrotoxic cellular stress. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, PBS, and trypsin/EDTA were from Invitrogen. The Cy-3 and Cy-5 N-hydroxysuccinimide ester dyes were synthesized by Dr. Piers Gaffney (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK). SyproRuby dye was from Molecular Probes; N,N-9-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPPD) was from Aldrich; SP600125 and SB203580 were from Biomol. U0126 was from Promega. DCVC was synthesized as described (32Hayden P.J. Stevens J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 468-476PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Treatment Conditions—The porcine renal epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide. pkGFP and pkGFP-FAT have been described previously (28van de Water B. Houtepen F. Huigsloot M. Tijdens I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36183-36193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For preparation of stable Hsp27 expressing cell lines, LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of DNA of pcDNA3.1-Hsp27wt or pcDNA3.1-Hsp27-S19A/S82A (further referred to as Hsp27-AA) (gift from T. Takano, McGill University (33Aoudjit L. Stanciu M. Li H. Lemay S. Takano T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F765-F774Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's procedures (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected using 800 μg/ml G418. Individual clones were picked and maintained in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml G418. Clones were analyzed for Hsp27 expression using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. For further experiments up to five stable cell lines were used per construct. For experiments, cells were plated in either 6-cm collagen-coated dishes or on collagen-coated glass coverslips in 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight in complete culture medium. Cells were treated with various concentrations of DCVC for the indicated times. All incubations were performed in the presence of 20 μm DPPD (10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide) to block the oxidative stress-dependent necrotic pathway but allowing for the onset of apoptosis (22van de Water B. Kruidering M. Nagelkerke J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F593-F603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zhan Y. Cleveland J.L. Stevens J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6755-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis—Apoptosis was determined by cell cycle analysis. Medium containing floating cells was collected. Adherent cells were washed twice with PBS, 1 mm EDTA and trypsinized. Floating cells and adherent cells that were trypsinized were pooled, centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS followed by fixation in 90% ethanol (-20 °C). Fixed cells were centrifuged and washed once with PBS followed by resuspending in PBS/EDTA containing 7.5 μm propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNase A. After 30 min at room temperature, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). The amount of cells in sub-G0/G1 was calculated using the Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Caspase Activity Measurement—Cells were scraped in medium and collected by centrifugation together with floating cells. The cell pellet was taken up in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm EGTA) and subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing in liquid nitrogen. The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and used to determine the protein concentration using the Bradford protein assay using IgG as a standard. Equal amounts of cell protein (10 μg) were used for measuring caspase activity using Ac-DEVD-AMC as a substrate (25 μm). AMC fluorescence was followed in time using a fluorescence plate reader (HTS 7000 Bio assay reader; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Caspase activity was calculated as pmol/mg of cell protein/min using AMC as a standard. Western Blot Analysis--For Western blot analysis, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) plus inhibitors (2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 17 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μm fenvalerate, 5 μm vanadate, and 1 μm okadaic acid) for 5 min. After lysis, cells were scraped and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm. Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) dry milk in TBS-T (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) or 5% (w/v) BSA in TBS-T overnight at 4 °C and probed with appropriate primary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature as follows: anti-cleaved caspase-3 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000, Pharmingen), anti-FAK (monoclonal, 1 μg/ml, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-Tyr(P)397-FAK (polyclonal, 0.25 mg/ml, BioSource), anti-paxillin (monoclonal, 0.5 μg/ml, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-Tyr(P)118-paxillin (polyclonal, 0.25 μg/ml, BioSource), anti-Hsp27 (rabbit polyclonal, 1 μg/ml, Cell Signaling), anti-Ser(P)82-Hsp27 (rabbjt polyclonal, 1 μg/ml, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-p38 (rabbit polyclonal, 1 μg/ml, Cell Signaling), anti-Thr(P)180/Tyr(P)182-p38 (rabbit polyclonal, 1 μg/ml, Cell Signaling), anti-JNK (rabbit polyclonal, 1 μg/ml, Cell Signaling), and anti-Thr(P)183/Tyr(P)185-JNK (rabbit polyclonal, 1 μg/ml, Promega). Thereafter blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) at 1:5000 dilution in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and detection with a fluorescence imager (Typhoon 9400, Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Cell Extracts for 2D-DIGE—For 2D-DIGE experiments, LLC-PK1 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes (∼2 × 106 cells) or 15-cm dishes (∼ 4 × 106 cells) in complete medium and allowed to grow for 3 days. Cells were serum-starved overnight in phenol red and serum-free DMEM. Thereafter, cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of DCVC in serum/phenol red-free DMEM. Cells were lysed in DIGE lysis buffer (8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8). The extracts were syringed several times followed by a 20-min centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 4 °C). The protein concentration was determined using Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Fresh cell lysates were labeled for 30 min on ice, in the dark, with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester derivatives of the cyanine dyes Cy-3 and Cy-5 (4 pmol/μg protein) for DIGE analysis. Reactions were quenched with a 50-fold molar excess of lysine solution to dye for 10 min on ice. The appropriate samples were mixed and reduced with 65 mm dithiothreitol. The final volume of the samples was made up to 350 μl with DIGE lysis buffer containing 1% each of ampholines/pharmalytes (GE Healthcare) and bromphenol blue. All samples were prepared and run in triplicate. Protein Separation by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis, Gel Imaging, and Two-dimensional Blotting—For isoelectric focusing, immobilized pH gradient strips pH 3-10 (GE Healthcare) were rehydrated with the cyanine dye-labeled samples at room temperature in the dark overnight. Isoelectric focusing was performed at 20 °C using a Multiphor II electrophoresis unit (GE Healthcare). A gradient of 300-3500 V was applied over 3 h followed by a constant voltage of 3500 V for 80 kV-h. Following focusing, the immobilized pH gradient strips were equilibrated at room temperature for 15 min in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8). The equilibrated, immobilized pH gradient strips were transferred onto 18 × 20-cm 12% uniform polyacrylamide gels for separation of proteins based on molecular weight. For DIGE analysis, gels were bonded to low fluorescent glass plates using PlusOne bind/silane solution (GE Healthcare). Each gel was run at 10 °C at a constant current of 40 mA for 5 h in Protean II gel tanks (Bio-Rad). All two-dimensional gels were scanned for Cy-3 and Cy-5 directly between low fluorescent glass plates using a 2920 2D-Master Imager at the appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths (GE Healthcare). Bonded gels were also post-stained with SyproRuby. Briefly, gels were fixed overnight in 30% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid. After washing the gels with water, total protein was detected by post-staining fixed gels with SyproRuby (Molecular Probes) for at least 3 h. Post-stained gels were washed with water to remove the excess of SyproRuby dye. Thereafter, gels were scanned using the 2920 2D Imager at the appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths (GE Healthcare). In some experiments, unlabeled two-dimensional gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes overnight. Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA followed by Western blotting essentially the same as described above. Image Analysis—All generated images were exported as .tif files for further analysis of protein and phosphorylation profiles. The 2D-DIGE images were analyzed using DeCyder software and are presented as pseudo-colored and overlaid Cy-3 and Cy-5 images prepared using Adobe Photoshop. Volumes of the spots were calculated using the differential image analysis mode of DeCyder. Matched spots from triplicate gels, which showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in spot volume after exposure of the cells to DCVC, had a >1.5 average fold difference in spot volume and could be detected by SyproRuby post-staining, were selected and excised from the DIGE gel using a Syprot spot picker (GE Healthcare). Spots were collected in 96-well plates and kept at -20 °C for subsequent protein identification by mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry—Peptide mass mapping by MALDI-TOF MS and peptide sequencing by nano-HPLC-electrospray ionization-collision-induced dissociation MS/MS was used for analysis of gel-separated proteins (35Naaby-Hansen S. Waterfield M.D. Cramer R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 376-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A standard protocol was used for in-gel proteolysis (36Cramer R. Saxton M. Barnouin K. Fu H. Methods in Molecular Biology. 261. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2004: 499-510Google Scholar). MALDI-MS spectra were recorded on a Reflex III (Bruker, Coventry, UK) mass spectrometer using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix and internally calibrated using tryptic autolysis peptide ion signals. Nano-HPLC-electrospray ionization-collision-induced dissociation MS/MS was performed using an Ultimate HPLC (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with a PepMap C18 75-μm inner diameter (LC Packings) column at a flow rate of ∼200 nl/min coupled to a Q-Tof (Micro-mass, Wythenshawe, UK) mass spectrometer. Spectra were processed by the manufacturers' software and submitted to Mascot (37Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar) and ProteinProspector (38Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) data base search routines. Peptide mass tolerance was set to 100 ppm for protein identification by peptide mass mapping. For peptide sequencing, the mass tolerance was set to 100 ppm for parent ion masses and 100 ppm or 100 millimass units for fragment ion masses. In general, significant hits from Mascot searches were considered as positive identifications. In the case of ProteinProspector searches, protein identifications were selected as significant hits by using criteria outlined in Ref. 39Benvenuti S. Cramer R. Quinn C.C. Bruce J. Zvelebil M.

A few MS/MS identifications were verified or established by manual data interpretation (de novo sequencing). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy—For immunofluorescence studies, cells were cultured on collagen-coated glass coverslips in 24-well dishes. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min followed by three washes with PBS. After cell permeabilization and blocking with PBS, 0.2% w/v Triton X-100, 0.5% w/v BSA, pH 7.4 (PTB), cells were stained for Thr(P)183-Tyr(P)185-JNK (Promega), Ser(P)82-Hsp27 (Cellular Signaling), FAK (clone 77, BD Transduction Laboratories), Tyr(P)397-FAK (BioSource), paxillin (BD Transduction Laboratories), and Tyr(P)118-paxillin (BioSource) diluted in PTB. For secondary staining, Alexa488-labeled goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) or Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) were used. Cells were mounted on glass slides using Aqua-Poly-Mount (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Cells were viewed using a Bio-Rad 2-photon confocal laser scanning microscope, and images were processed with Adode Photoshop 6.0. Gel Filtration Experiments—pkHsp27 and pkAA-Hsp27 cel"

However, little is known about the factors that regulate alternative splicing. Here we demonstrate that one isoform of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (named CARM1-v3) associates with the U1 small nuclear RNP-specific protein U1C and affects 5′ splice site selection of the pre-mRNA splicing. CARM1-v3 was generated by the retention of introns 15 and 16 of the primary transcript of CARM1. Its deduced protein lacks the C-terminal domain of the major isoform of CARM1 and instead has v3-specific sequences at the C terminus. CARM1-v3, but not the other isoforms, strongly stimulates a shift to the distal 5′ splice site of the pre-mRNA when the adenoviral E1A minigene is used as a reporter and enhances the exon skips in the CD44 reporter. A CARM1-v3 mutant lacking the v3-specific sequences completely lost the ability to regulate the alternative splicing patterns. In addition, CARM1-v3 shows tissue-specific expression patterns distinct from those of the other isoforms.

Commonly, alternative splicing determines the inclusion of a portion of coding sequence in the mRNA, giving rise to protein isoforms that differ in their peptide sequence and hence chemical and biological activity. The mechanism of alternative splicing permits diversity of translatable mRNAs, thereby increasing the proteome diversity encoded by a limited number of genes. Genetic switches based on alternative splicing are known to be important in many cellular and developmental processes, including sex determination, apoptosis, axon guidance, and tissue-specific differentiation (2Bell L.R. Maine E.M. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Cell. 1988; 55: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 3Lisbin M.J. Qiu J. White K.

Although a large variety of splicing decisions can be explained by the antagonistic effects of general splicing factors, such as serine/arginine-rich proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; CARM1, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; ER, estrogen receptor; E2, estradiol; GST, glutathione S-transferase. it is most likely that tissue-specific or developmentally regulated splicing factors have an important role in the regulation of alternative splicing. In Drosophila melanogaster, sex-lethal functions as a regulator of alternative splicing in sex determination (2Bell L.R. Maine E.M. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Cell. 1988; 55: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and the embryonic lethal abnormal visual system is a gene-specific regulator of alternative pre-mRNA processing in neurons (3Lisbin M.J. Qiu J. White K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2546-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, in mammals, only a limited number of splicing regulators have been identified to date, despite the large diversity of the mammalian gene transcripts, and little is known about the mechanisms by which alternative splicing is regulated. Pre-mRNA splicing occurs in a large multicomponent ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome, which is composed of U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles and many non-snRNP protein splicing factors (5Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). U1 snRNP recognizes the 5′ splice site and is among the first factors to interact with the pre-mRNA to form complexes (complex E in mammalian extracts) that commit the pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway (6Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). U1 snRNP is composed of a U1 snRNA, seven different Sm proteins common to other snRNPs, and three U1-specific proteins: U1–70K, U1-A, and U1C (7Luhrmann R. Kastner B. Bach M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 265-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). U1C does not interact directly with naked U1 snRNA, but a recent study indicated that U1C recognizes the sequence of the 5′ splice site and argued that this RNA-protein recognition precedes base pairing with U1 snRNA (8Du H. Rosbash M. Nature. 2002; 419: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, the splicing regulator TIA-1 has been shown to interact with U1C to promote the recruitment of U1 snRNP to 5′ splice sites (9Forch P. Puig O. Martinez C. Seraphin B. Valcarcel J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6882-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the EWS/NOR1 fusion gene product identified in extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma binds to U1C and affects pre-mRNA splicing (10Ohkura N. Yaguchi H. Tsukada T. Yamaguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 535-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that some splicing regulators affect the 5′ splice site selection of the pre-mRNA splicing through their binding to U1C. In the present study, to isolate splicing regulators that affect 5′ splice site selection, we searched for proteins associated with U1C using a yeast two-hybrid system. This strategy allowed the isolation of an isoform of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), along with known splicing regulators Fox-1 (11Jin Y. Suzuki H. Maegawa S. Endo H. Sugano S. Hashimoto K. Yasuda K. Inoue K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), HRNBP2, and RBM4 (12Lai M.C. Kuo H.W. Chang W.C. Tarn W.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CARM1 has been shown to act as a transcriptional coactivator and cooperate synergistically with p300/CBP and p160 coactivators to enhance transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors (13Chen D. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that one isoform of CARM1 (named CARM1-v3), but not the other isoforms, strongly stimulates a shift to the distal 5′ splice site of the pre-mRNA splicing. Our results indicate that the transcriptional coactivator could allow the transcriptional machinery to control the alternative splicing in an isoform-specific manner. Plasmids—The U1C cDNA was isolated from human placental cDNA by PCR amplification and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The fetal forebrain cDNA library was generated from primary cultured rat forebrain cells (embryonic day 17) in pAD-GAL4–2.1, as described previously (14Ohkura N. Hijikuro M. Yamamoto A. Miki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The full-length CARM1 isoforms were cloned from the rat fetal forebrain cDNA library. Various deletion constructs of CARM1, UD1 (amino acids 120–573), UD2 (240–573), LD4 (1–480), and LD5 (1–539), were generated by PCR amplification, and methyltransferase-defective mutants of CARM1 were generated using a QuikChange site-direct mutagenesis kit. These cDNA fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme mapping. For yeast two-hybrid screening, the U1C cDNA was inserted into the pGBT9 vector (Clontech). For mammalian two-hybrid systems, the cDNA constructs were inserted into the pCMV-AD or pCMV-BD vectors (Stratagene). The plasmids pFR-Luc, pRL-Luc, and phRGB were purchased commercially (Promega). Expression plasmids for FLAG or myc-tagged proteins were constructed by inserting the cDNA into the pCMV-Tag2 or pCMV-Tag3 vectors (Stratagene). pCS3-MT-E1A, pMMTV-CD44, pSG5.HA GRIP1, ERE-Luc, GST-UP1, and Dlxin-1 cDNA were kindly provided by Drs. F. Moreau-Gachelin, B. W. O'Mally, M. R. Stallcup, S. Ozawa, N. Tsuchiya, and K. Watanabe, respectively. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. COS-7 and HEK293T cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and Polyfect (Qiagen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast Two-hybrid System—All experiments were performed in the yeast reporter strain YRG2 (Stratagene). pGBT9-U1C was used as bait to screen a rat fetal forebrain cDNA library (in pAD-GAL4–2.1, Stratagene) by sequential transformation. Cells transformed with the two fusion plasmids were selected by growth on SD plates (-Trp, -Leu, and -His) and β-galactosidase expression. Plasmids were extracted from positive clones and introduced into Escherichia coli cells for the recovery and sequencing of plasmid DNA. Mammalian Two-hybrid System—HEK293T cells were grown to 50% confluence in 24-well plates and then transfected with pCMV-BD, pCMV-AD, reporter plasmid pFR-Luc (Stratagene), and the Renilla luciferase expression plasmid phRGB (Promega). The total amount of plasmid DNA used for transfection was kept constant by adding an appropriate amount of vector plasmid. After incubation for 30 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed with the cell lysis supernatant using dual-luciferase reporter reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Immunoprecipitation—HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged CARM1-v3 expression plasmid and myc-tagged U1C expression plasmid. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and one Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)) and sonicated briefly. Anti-myc antibody-agarose affinity gel (Clontech) was incubated with the lysates for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the agarose beads. FLAG or myc-tagged proteins were detected by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Cultured cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablet) and then briefly sonicated to reduce viscosity. Protein extracts were electrophoresed on a 7.5∼12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon, Millipore). The proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) or anti-myc (Roche Applied Science) antibodies. AD fusion proteins were detected using rabbit anti-NF-kB p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein bands were visualized using the ECL Plus Western blot analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). UV Cross-link Analysis—RNA probes were synthesized by transcription of E1A or CD44-containing pCRII-TOPO plasmids (Invitrogen) linearized with BamHI using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. The RNA probes were mixed with a recombinant protein in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min at 20 °C. After UV cross-linking using UV-linker (FS-800, Funakoshi) for 4 min, the samples were treated with RNaseA (0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then dried and subjected to autoradiography. RNA-Protein Blot Analysis—Recombinant proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes according to a standard method. The membranes were incubated with blocking buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA at 4 °C for 12 h and further incubated in the same buffer containing 4 × 105cpm/ml of a 32P-labeled probe at room temperature for 60 min. After washing in buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA for 15 min four times, they were subjected to autoradiography. Synthetic ribonucleotide homopolymers, poly(G), poly(A), poly(U), and poly(C), used as probes, were end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase. In Vivo Splicing Assay—COS-7 cells grown in two sets of 60-mm dishes were transfected with 2.5 μg of FLAG-tagged CARM1 isoform expression plasmid and 0.5 μg of E1A or CD44 reporter plasmid. After incubation for 30 h, total RNA was extracted from one dish using the RNeasy column kit (Qiagen), and the cells from another dish were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for Western blotting. cDNA synthesis was performed using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplification of various E1A and CD44 isoforms was carried out with E1A primers (RR67, GAGCTTGGGCGACTCA; E1A2, TCTAGACACAGGTGATGTCG) and CD44 primers (CDS, AGACACCATGCATGGTGCACC; CDAS, CCATCCCAGCATCAGGAGTG). PCR was conducted for 1 cycle of 1 min at 95 °C; 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1.5 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and a final extension for 5 min at 72 °C. Amplified products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. The gels were scanned by densitometry using an image analyzer (QuantityOne-4.4.1, Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad). In Vitro Methylation Assays—In vitro methylation assays were performed as described (15Teyssier C. Chen D. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46066-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged CARM1 expression plasmid. After incubation for 35 h, cells were harvested in lysis buffer. Cell lysates were frozen at –80 °C, thawed on ice, and clarified by centrifugation before incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with NETN buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl) and resuspended in HMT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.4 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 3 mg of histone H3 (Roche Applied Science) and 7 mm S-adenocyl-l-[methyl-3H]metionine in HMT buffer for 1 h at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS loading buffer and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled bands were visualized using Amplify Fluorographic Reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Coactivator Function of CARM1 Isoforms—COS-7 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 250 ng of MMTV-(ERE)-Luc reporter plasmid, 5 ng of estrogen receptor (ER), 125 ng of GRIP1, 400 ng of FLAG-tagged CARM1 isoform, and 125 ng of the Renilla luciferase expression plasmid phRGB and treated with 20 nm estradiol (E2) for 22 h before being harvested. Cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Isolation of U1C-binding Proteins as Candidates for Splicing Regulators—U1 snRNP recognizes the 5′ splice site and is among the first factors to interact with the pre-mRNA to form complexes that commit the pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway. To identify the cellular factors that affect 5′ splice site selection, we screened the rat fetal brain cDNA library for proteins associated with U1C, one of the U1-specific proteins, using a yeast two-hybrid system. We isolated dozens of clones and identified seven factors that showed high levels of HIS3 and β-galactosidase reporter gene activation in the system (Fig. 1B). Three clones encoded known splicing regulators: RNA-binding protein Fox-1 (11Jin Y. Suzuki H. Maegawa S. Endo H. Sugano S. Hashimoto K. Yasuda K. Inoue K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), hexaribonucleotide-binding protein 2 (HRNBP2), and RNA-binding motif protein 4 (RBM4) (12Lai M.C. Kuo H.W. Chang W.C. Tarn W.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), while the rest encoded far upstream element binding protein 1 (FBP1) (16Davis-Smyth T. Duncan R.C. Zheng T. Michelotti G. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31679-31687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), 20 S proteasome α subunit C8 (C8) (17Bose S. Stratford F.L. Broadfoot K.I. Mason G.G. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a member of the necdin/melanoma-associated antigen family (Dlxin-1) (18Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and a variant of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (named here CARM1-v3), which were not known to be involved in regulating splicing. We first examined the effect of these proteins on alternative splicing in vivo by using the adenoviral E1A minigene as a splicing model (Fig. 1A, upper). The E1A minigene (pCS-MT-E1A) was coexpressed with expression vectors of the isolated cDNA clones, and thereafter, alternatively spliced isoforms of E1A were detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. According to the presence of three alternative 5′ splice sites in the E1A pre-mRNA, three major isoforms (13 S, 12 S, and 9 S) and two minor isoforms (11 S and 10 S) can be transcribed from the E1A minigene (19Wang J. Manley J.L. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 335-346PubMed Google Scholar). In COS-7 cells transfected with pCS3-MT-E1A and empty vector, we detected 13 S and 12 S isoforms as major RNA species (control), indicating that isoforms generated by proximal splice site selection are mainly detected in COS-7 cells. In contrast, transfection of hnRNP A1, used as a positive control, resulted in an increase of 9 S isoforms and a decrease in the relative proportions of 13 S and 12 S isoforms, indicating that hnRNP A1 modulate 5′ splicing site selection from proximal to distal sites, as reported previously (20Yang X. Bani M.R. Lu S.J. Rowan S. Ben-David Y. Chabot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Similarly, a shift from proximal to distal sites in the 5′ splice site selection was also observed in COS-7 cells transfected with Fox-1, HRNBP2, FBP1, RBM4, and CARM1-v3. Notably, cells transfected with CARM1-v3 showed a great increase in 9 S isoforms and a concomitant decrease in the 13 S and 12 S isoforms. Cells transfected with C8 and Dlxin-1 showed little change in alternative splicing. We furthermore tested the effect of isolated factors on the pre-mRNA splicing of the CD44 minigene, since CD44 gene expression is extensively regulated by alternative splicing and since the resulting CD44 isoforms are known to be involved in tumor progression, immune responses, and embryonal development (21Gunthert U. Hofmann M. Rudy W. Reber S. Zoller M. Haussmann I. Matzku S. Wenzel A. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1991; 65: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 22Arch R. Wirth K.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The CD44 minigene contains the variable exons v4 and v5 of the human CD44 gene, along with their surrounding intron sequences (24Auboeuf D. Honig A. Berget S.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 2002; 298: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The transfection of COS-7 cells with the CD44 minigene and empty vector gave rise to two major spliced RNA products, containing either both variable exons (two-exon inclusion) or only one variable exon (one-exon inclusion) and a minor product with none of these exons (skipping) (Fig. 1A, lower, control). Cells cotransfected with Fox-1, HRNBP2, and CARM1-v3 showed an increase in the one-exon/two-exon ratio of spliced mRNAs as compared with the empty vector-transfected cells (control), and cells transfected with FBP1 and RBM4 showed a slight increase in the ratio. In contrast, the transfection of C8 and Dlxin-1 had little effect on the alternative splicing of the CD44 minigene. These results are summarized in Fig. 1B. Our finding that Fox-1, HRNBP2, and RBM4 affected alternative splicing is consistent with reports that Fox-1 induced muscle-specific exon skipping of the human mitochondrial ATP synthase γ subunit gene (11Jin Y. Suzuki H. Maegawa S. Endo H. Sugano S. Hashimoto K. Yasuda K. Inoue K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), that HRNBP2 is classified as a subtype of Fox-1, and that RBM4 acts antagonistically to serine/arginine-rich proteins in splice site and exon selection. Among newly isolated potential U1C-interacting proteins, we chose CARM1-v3, known as a positive regulator of transcription, for further analysis, since it showed the strongest effects on alternative splicing in the E1A reporter assay among the proteins examined and has not been demonstrated as a factor related to pre-mRNA splicing. CARM1-v3 Interacts with U1C in Mammalian Cells—To confirm the association between CARM1-v3 and U1C in vivo, a test using a mammalian two-hybrid system was performed. Full-length U1C fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the mammalian-two hybrid vector pCMV-BD (BD-U1C) was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with CARM1-v3 fused to the NF-κB activation domain in the pCMV-AD vector (AD-CARM1-v3) and a reporter plasmid pFR-Luc. Cotransfection of AD-CARM1-v3 with BD-U1C resulted in the production of high levels of luciferase activity (Fig. 2A). Cells transfected with the combination of BD-U1C and AD-vector or that of BD-vector and AD-CARM1-v3 showed little or no luciferase activity. To confirm the association further, coimmunoprecipitation studies were performed with both proteins coexpressed as tagged fusion protein in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2B). FLAG-tagged CARM1-v3 and myc-tagged U1C were cotranfected into HEK293T cells, and lysates from the cotransfected cells were used for immunoprecipitation. An anti-myc antibody coimmunoprecipitated myc-U1C along with FLAG-CARM1-v3. A normal mouse IgG did not coimmunoprecipitate myc-U1C and FLAG-CARM1-v3. These results indicate that CARM1-v3 interacts with U1C, not only in yeast but also in mammalian cells. To delineate the region of CARM1-v3 responsible for the interaction with U1C, deletion plasmids of AD-CARM1-v3 were constructed. Mammalian two-hybrid assays were performed on this series of CARM1-v3 deletions with BD or BD-U1C (Fig. 2A). High levels of luciferase activity were observed when BD-U1C was cotranfected with AD-UD1 (amino acids 120–573 in CARM1-v3) or AD-LD5 (1–539). Other constructs, AD-UD2 and -LD4, did not show stronger luciferase activity than the AD vector. Therefore, the region required for interaction between CARM1-v3 and U1C comprised the central region of CARM1-v3. CARM1-v3 Does Not Bind to the Pre-mRNA Directly—Many splicing regulators have been shown to possess RNA recognition motifs and to bind RNA directly. In fact, isolated U1C-binding clones Fox-1, HRNBP2, and RBM4, all of which showed splicing activity, had RNA recognition motifs or activity to bind RNA. However, CARM1-v3, which showed a strong effect on alternative splicing, does not have any RNA recognition motifs. Therefore, we examined by UV cross-link analysis whether CARM1-v3 was able to bind to the pre-mRNA directly. As shown in Fig. 3A, signal for 32P-labeled RNA was detected at the estimated location of the GST-fused Fox-1 protein, which is consistent with the report that Fox-1 bound to the specific RNA sequence GUAUG (11Jin Y. Suzuki H. Maegawa S. Endo H. Sugano S. Hashimoto K. Yasuda K. Inoue K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). On the other hand, signal was not observed at the location of the GST-fused CARM1-v3. We furthermore confirmed RNA binding activity of CARM1-v3 using synthetic ribonucleotide homopolymers, poly(A), poly(C), poly(U), and poly(G). GST-fused proteins were separated, transferred to PVDF membranes, and incubated with 32P-labeled RNA homopolymers. As shown in Fig. 3B, unwinding protein 1 (UP1, a proteolytic fragment of hnRNP A1) (25Nadler S.G. Merrill B.M. Roberts W.J. Keating K.M. Lisbin M.J. Barnett S.F. Wilson S.H. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), used as a positive control, bound to poly(G), but CARM1-v3 did not show binding with any of the four homopolymers. These results suggest that the effect of CARM1-v3 on the E1A or CD44 pre-mRNA splicing was not mediated by direct binding to the target pre-mRNA. Four Isoforms Were Transcrib"

At the G1/S transition, elevated cyclin E-CDK2 activity triggers 1DNA replication to enter S phase. The CDK cycle works as an engine that drives progression of cell cycle events by successive activation of different types of cyclin-CDK. However, how the CDK cycle is coordinated with replication initiation remains elusive. Here we report that acute depletion of ORC2 by RNA interference (RNAi) arrests cells with low cyclin E-CDK2 activity. This result suggests that loss of a replication initiation protein prevents progression of the CDK cycle in G1. p27 and p21 proteins accumulate following ORC2 RNAi and are required for the CDK2 inhibition. Restoration of CDK activity by co-depletion of p27 and p21 allows many ORC2-depleted cells to enter S phase and go on to mitosis. However, in some cells the release of the CDK2 block caused catastrophic events like apoptosis. Therefore, the CDK2 inhibition observed following ORC2 RNAi seems to protect cells from premature S phase entry and crisis in DNA replication. These results demonstrate an unexpected role of ORC2 in CDK2 activation, a linkage that could be important for maintaining genomic stability.

These results demonstrate an unexpected role of ORC2 in CDK2 activation, a linkage that could be important for maintaining genomic stability. The CDK cycle governs the sequence of cell cycle events by successively phosphorylating proteins that trigger essential processes of cell proliferation such as DNA replication and mitosis (1van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 2Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell.

In addition to binding to cyclins, the activity of CDK is regulated by its phosphorylation. Removal of the inhibitory phosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 of CDK by Cdc25 phosphatase and phosphorylation of the T-loop by CDK-activating kinase are also required for CDK2 activity (4Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Activities of G1 and S phase cyclin-CDK complexes are also regulated by binding to CDK inhibitor proteins such as p27 and p21 (5Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). p27 protein levels are high in G0 and G1 phases to maintain low CDK activity. Proteasome-mediated degradation following ubiquitinylation by SCFSkp2 complex is responsible for the low levels of p27 protein during S-G2 phases (6Hara T. Kamura T. Nakayama K. Oshikawa K. Hatakeyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48937-48943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). p27 is also ubiquitinylated by KPC1 and degraded by proteasome upon cell cycle entry (7Kamura T.

On the other hand, p21 plays an important role in cell cycle arrest after DNA damage. p53 activation by checkpoint pathways induces p21 transcription to inhibit cell cycle progression, but there are several p53-independent pathways for inducing p21 mRNA (8Macleod K.F.

Initiation of DNA replication first requires the assembly of prereplicative complexes (pre-RCs) 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, prereplicative complex; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; ORC, origin recognition complex; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; MCM, minichromosome maintenance. at origins of DNA replication during the G1 phase (9Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Origin recognition complex (ORC) is a six-subunit complex required to mark the origins of DNA replication. In late M and early G1 phases, CDC6 and CDT1 are recruited to origins in an ORC-dependent fashion followed by chromatin-loading of MCM2–7 complexes to form pre-RCs (10Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Elevated activity of CDK2 at G1/S promotes loading of initiation proteins such as CDC45 on origins to initiate DNA replication (9Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Activation of cyclin E-CDK2 is believed to be independent of the amount of replication initiator proteins. In this paper, however, we found that depletion of one of the replication initiation proteins results in G1 arrest with low cyclin E-CDK2 activity. Cell cycle progression was halted by inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 by p27 and p21 accumulation. These results suggest a requirement of replication proteins for CDK2 activation and provide a link between CDK2 and initiation proteins that couples cell cycle progression to replication initiation. Cell Culture and RNAi—Cells were cultured under standard growth condition. For siRNA transfection, cells were grown at ∼50% confluence in a 6-well plate and transfected at 24-h intervals with 0.24 nmol of annealed siRNA duplex (Dharmacon Research) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Six hours after the first transfection, cells were split 1:2 to maintain the cells in log phase.

Western and Northern Blotting—ORC3, ORC4, and ORC6 antibodies were described earlier (11Pinto S. Quintana D.G. Smith P. Mihalek R.M. Hou Z.H. Boynton S. Jones C.J. Hendricks M. Velinzon K.

Rabbit antibodies against ORC1 and ORC5 were raised using His6-tagged recombinant proteins, ORC1 (220–831) and ORC5 (75–686). Anti-p27 (C-19), anti-p21 (C-19), anti-MCM7 (141.2), anti-cyclin E (HE12), anti-cyclin A (H-432), anti-cyclin B (H-433), and anti-CDK2 (M2) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-ORC2 and anti-β-actin antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences and Sigma, respectively. Anti-p53 antibody was obtained from Cell signaling technology. Anti-pRB antibody was the kind gift of Dr. E. Harlow. Cellular total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen). Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). For kinase assay, equal amounts of cell lysates (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK4 (C-22), anti-cyclin E (HE111), anti-cyclin A (H-432), or anti-cyclin B1 (H-433) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In vitro kinase assay was carried out using recombinant pRB-C and histone H1 as substrates as described previously (14Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4673-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). BrdUrd Immunostaining and FACS Analyses—Cells were treated with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and stained with anti-BrdUrd antibody containing nuclease (Amersham Biosciences) diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin (1:2) for 45 min at room temperature. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline three times, cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Pierce) diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin (1:500). Percentage of cells incorporating BrdUrd was calculated as an average of three samples. FACS analysis for DNA content was performed as described (15Dhar S.K. Delmolino L. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29067-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Percentages of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases were calculated using ModiFit. DNA Synthesis Is Reduced in ORC2-depleted Cells—ORC2 is a part of the core of the origin recognition complex (15Dhar S.K. Delmolino L. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29067-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Upon RNAi targeting ORC2 in MCF10A breast epithelial cells, ORC2 protein levels were decreased (Fig. 1A). Two siRNA oligonucleotides against different parts of the ORC2 mRNA were used to guard against off-target activity. ORC2-A can reduce ORC2 protein more efficiently than ORC2-B. ORC2 RNAi also decreased levels of ORC1 and ORC3–6 proteins after 72 h (Fig. 1B). Messenger RNA levels of ORC3, ORC4, and ORC5 were unchanged in ORC2-depleted cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the other components of the ORC core subcomplex, ORC3–5, are unstable in the absence of ORC2 protein. This result is consistent with our previous result that ORC3 protein is decreased without change in mRNA level in an ORC2 hypomorphic mutant cell line (16Dhar S.K. Yoshida K. Machida Y. Khaira P. Chaudhuri B. Wohlschlegel J.A. Leffak M. Yates J. Dutta A. Cell. 2001; 106: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mRNA levels of ORC1 and ORC6 decreased significantly in ORC2-depleted cells. Since ORC1 is regulated by E2F (17Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Leone G. Herendeen D.R. Kelly T.J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6977-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the decrease in ORC1 mRNA might be caused indirectly by the inhibition of CDK activity that we describe below. On the other hand, E2F-mediated regulation of ORC6 promoter has not been reported, and the genomic sequence upstream from the start site of the cDNA did not show any obvious E2F binding site (13Dhar S.K. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34983-34988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether ORC2 is decreased enough to impair DNA replication. We examined DNA synthesis after ORC2 RNAi. BrdUrd-positive cells were reduced by around 90% in cells treated with ORC2-A siRNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 1D). ORC2-B, which reduced ORC2 protein less efficiently, showed less effect on BrdUrd incorporation. Cells with G1 DNA content accumulated and those with S phase DNA content decreased after 72-h treatment with ORC2 RNAi (Fig. 1E). Collectively these results indicate that depletion of ORC2 decreases several other ORC subunits and promotes the accumulation of cells with unreplicated DNA. ORC2 Depletion Does Not Activate DNA Replication or DNA Damage Checkpoints—To test whether DNA damage or DNA replication checkpoint pathways were activated upon acute depletion of ORC2, phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser317 and Chk2 on Thr68 were examined (Fig. 1F). Those residues are phosphorylated after activation of DNA replication or DNA damage checkpoints. Hydroxyurea-treated cells and daunorubicin-treated cells were used as a positive control for the activation of the two checkpoints. The results indicate that ORC2 depletion does not activate DNA replication or DNA damage checkpoints. Cyclin E-associated Kinase Activity Is Inhibited in ORC2-depleted Cells—Activation of cyclin E-CDK2 at G1/S was expected not to be affected by loss of an initiator protein. Surprisingly, in vitro kinase assays with immunoprecipitated proteins revealed that cyclin E-associated kinase was inhibited after 36-h treatment with ORC2-A RNAi (Fig. 2A). RNAi against p53 did not have such an effect, suggesting that the inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 activity is not a nonspecific effect due to activation of RNA interference pathway. After 72 h, ORC2-depleted cells accumulate with 2N DNA content in the FACS analysis (Fig. 1E). We therefore examined where the CDK cycle is arrested in those cells. Examination of cyclin levels by immunoblotting showed that the cells are arrested with high cyclin D1 and cyclin E levels (Fig. 2B). In vitro kinase assays revealed that, although CDK4 kinase activity was unchanged, cyclin E-CDK2 activity is inhibited in these cells (Fig. 2C). Inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 activity would account for the cyclin E accumulation seen in Fig. 2B due to a decrease in its autophosphorylation and ubiquitinylation (18Clurman B.E. Sheaff R.J. Thress K. Groudine M. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 19Won K.A. Reed S.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4182-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Considering the accumulation of cyclin E protein, the decrease in the specific activity of cyclin E-associated kinase was even greater than the 70% seen in Fig. 2C. The increase of cyclin D1 protein after 72 h could be due to arrest of the CDK cycle in G1 phase where the level of the protein is high. In contrast to G1 cyclins, cyclin A and cyclin B1 levels were low in ORC2-depleted cells after 72 h (Fig. 2B), accounting for the low kinase activity in the in vitro kinase assay using anti-cyclin A and anti-cyclin B1 antibodies (Fig. 2C). pRB was hypophosphorylated in cells transfected with ORC2 siRNAs, confirming that CDK2 is inhibited in vivo (Fig. 2D). The hypophosphorylated form of pRB binds E2F and works as a co-suppressor for E2F-regulated genes (20Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). It was reported that partial phosphorylation of pRB by cyclin D-CDK4/6 relieves the suppression of cyclin E promoter, allowing cyclin E expression. Consistent with the unchanged activity of cyclin D-CDK4, cyclin E mRNA was not decreased in ORC2 RNAi-treated cells (Fig. 2E). Further phosphorylation of pRB by cyclin E-CDK2 is required for relieving cyclin A promoter suppression by pRB (21Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 22Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A. Ma D. Luo R.X. Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Decrease in cyclin E-CDK2 activity therefore explains the decrease in cyclin A mRNA, cyclin A and B1 protein levels, and kinase activities (Fig. 2, B, C, and E). In summary, the CDK cycle is inhibited at the step of cyclin E-CDK2 activation in ORC2-depleted cells. ORC2 Depletion Results in Accumulation of CDK Inhibitors p27 and p21—We next explored how cyclin E-CDK2 activity is inhibited in ORC2-depleted cells. Two CDK inhibitors, p27 and p21, were accumulated in MCF10A cells after decreasing ORC2 level by two different siRNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 3A). To ensure that the p27 and p21 responses were not unique to the breast epithelial cell line MCF10A, ORC2 was depleted in WI-38 primary lung fibroblasts. p27 and p21 accumulation was also observed in WI-38 (Fig. 3B). Since p27 is targeted for degradation after phosphorylation by cyclin E-CDK2 (23Tsvetkov L.M. Yeh K.H. Lee S.J. Sun H. Zhang H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 24Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), we wanted to ensure that the p27 accumulation was not a secondary effect of CDK2 inhibition. A time course study was performed to determine whether p27 accumulation preceded or followed cyclin E-CDK2 inhibition. After ORC2-A RNAi p27 starts to accumulate as early as 24 h, in parallel with the decrease in ORC2 protein (Fig. 3C) and before the inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 kinase activity or hypophosphorylation of RB. After 36 h, p27 levels increase further, and cyclin E-associated kinase activity decreases. At this time point, more p27 is associated with cyclin E (Fig. 3D, lane 2). Therefore, p27 accumulation precedes cyclin E-CDK2 inhibition and could be the cause rather than the effect of CDK2 inhibition. Consistent with the decrease in cyclin E-CDK2 activity, hypophosphorylated pRB appeared at the 36-h time point. MCM7, encoded by an E2F-regulated gene, starts to decrease after 48 h. These results suggest that p27 increase is an early response to ORC2 depletion and is not secondary to the decrease in CDK2 kinase activity. Once CDK2 kinase activity is inhibited, suppression of E2F by pRB leads to further suppression of other S phase activators like MCM7 and cyclin A. After ORC2 RNAi the p21 level also starts to increase at 24 h and reaches the maximum at 36 h time point, when cyclin E-CDK2 becomes inactive (Fig. 3C). This is much before the time point when secondary effects of the cell cycle arrest become evident as revealed by MCM decrease at 48 h, suggesting that p21 elevation could also be a cause (rather than effect) of cyclin E-CDK2 inhibition after ORC2 depletion. p27 Protein Is Stabilized, and p21 mRNA Is Induced after ORC2 Depletion—We next sought the mechanism of p27 and p21 accumulation. p27 mRNA does not increase in the ORC-depleted cells suggesting that regulation of the protein is at the post-transcriptional level (Fig. 4A). After 26-h treatment of ORC2 RNAi, cycloheximide was added to block new protein synthesis and the rate of decrease of p27 protein examined (Fig. 4, B and C). Quantitation of p27 protein levels revealed that the half-life of p27 was increased from 1.4 h to 5.6 h in ORC2 RNAi-treated cells, indicating that p27 is stabilized after ORC2 RNAi. In contrast to p27, the mRNA level of p21 was increased after 36-h treatment of ORC2 RNAi (Fig. 4A). p53 is a well known inducer of p21 in response to DNA damage. We tested involvement of p53 in the p21 induction by sequential transfection of siRNAs against p53 and ORC2. Although pretreatment of cells with p53 siRNA reduced p53 to lower than basal level, p21 mRNA was still increased by ORC2 RNAi (Fig. 4D). This result suggests that p21 expression is induced by a p53-independent mechanism. Consistent with the idea that the general p53 pathway is not activated after ORC2 RNAi, another p53-regulated gene, PIG3 (25Flatt P.M. Polyak K. Tang L.J. Scatena C.D. Westfall M.D. Rubinstein L.A. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Hill D.E. Pietenpol J.A. Cancer Lett. 2000; 156: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), was not induced after ORC2 RNAi (Fig. 4A). p27 and p21 Inhibit Cyclin E-CDK2 following ORC2 Depletion—To test whether p27 and p21 are responsible for the inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 following ORC2 depletion, we performed RNAi against p27 and/or p21 prior to ORC2 RNAi. When p27 or p21 alone are depleted, cyclin E-CDK2 activity was only partially restored after ORC2 RNAi (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 and 6). However, when both p27 and p21 are depleted prior to ORC2 RNAi, the cyclin E-CDK2 activity was restored almost to the control level in ORC2-depleted cells (Fig. 5A, lane 8, and Fig. 5B). This result indicates that the induction of p21 and p27 is critical for inhibition of CDK2 after ORC2 depletion. Inhibition of DNA Synthesis after ORC2 Depletion Is Caused Partly by CDK2 Inhibition—Restoration of cyclin E-CDK2 activity in ORC2-depleted cells by co-depletion of p21 and p27 prompted us to test if CDK2 inhibition contributes to inhibition of DNA synthesis after ORC2 depletion. Cells transfected with p21 and p27 siRNAs were treated with ORC2 RNAi and BrdUrd incorporation measured by immunostaining using anti-BrdUrd antibody. BrdUrd-positive cells decreased by 80% after ORC2 RNAi (Fig. 6A and 6B). Pretreatment with p21 and p27 siRNAs increased BrdUrd-positive cells after ORC2 RNAi, indicating that part of the inhibition of DNA synthesis following ORC2 depletion is caused by CDK2 inhibition but not by decrease in ORC2 protein levels. Furthermore, there is a 15-fold increase in the number of ORC2-depleted cells that enter mitosis when p27 and p21 are removed (Fig. 6C), supporting the notion that some ORC2-depleted cells are arrested by CDK inhibition rather than inhibition of DNA replication. Therefore, in many cells CDK inhibition is seen at levels of ORC2 that is sufficient for DNA replication. The active CDK inhibition arrests these cells before S phase. Once CDK inhibition is relieved, these cells are actually capable of DNA replication and go into mitosis. We next tested whether apoptosis is induced in the ORC2-depleted cells when the CDK2 inhibition is abrogated. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage is a marker of apoptosis induction (26Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). Forced progression of ORC2-depleted cells into S phase by p27 and p21 RNAi induced apoptosis (Fig. 6D). Therefore inhibition of CDK2 by p27 and p21 prevents cells from initiating DNA synthesis with low levels of ORC and therefore protects cells from catastrophic events in the S phase. In this study we discovered that progression of the CDK cycle is prevented after depletion of one of the replication initiation proteins, ORC2. ORC2-depleted cells are arrested in G1 phase through inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 (Fig. 7). Since initiation of DNA replication defines S phase (S for synthesis), one might say that cells are in G1 phase when DNA replication is inhibited by ORC2 RNAi. Since CDK activity is low in the G1 phase, one might therefore jump to the conclusion that CDK activity is low after ORC depletion simply as a reflection of the cell cycle stage. However, this logic is not correct because CDK activation at G1/S is expected to occur regardless of ORC amount. For example, yeast Orc mutants activate CDK even when replication initiation fails, leading to activation of DNA damage checkpoint pathways or even premature entry into mitosis with unreplicated DNA (27Hofmann J.F. Beach D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 28Labib K. Kearsey S.E. Diffley J.F.X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3658-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Kelly T.J. Martin G.S. Forsburg S.L. Stephen R.J. Russo A. Nurse P. Cell. 1993; 74: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 30Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Therefore, the CDK2 inhibition that is seen following ORC2 depletion is unexpected and unique to higher eukaryotes. We suggest that the linkage between ORC function and CDK2 activation has evolved to prevent such premature progression of the mammalian cell cycle. CDK inhibition following ORC2 RNAi is due to accumulation of p27 and p21. p27 and p21 accumulation is a cause of CDK inhibition rather than a result of G1 arrest, since knock-down of p27 and p21 restores CDK activity in ORC2-depleted cells. RNAi decreases ORC2 in the entire population of cells to less than 10% of wild type levels, but there are bound to be variations in the extent of depletion between cells in the population. Indeed DNA synthesis was partially restored when CDK activity is recovered in ORC2-depleted cells. In many of the cells, DNA replication was normal enough to allow the cells to progress to mitosis, although we cannot distinguish whether the recovered DNA replication is from initiation at new origins or from elongation of pre-existing forks. Given that cancer cells can proliferate with less than 10% of ORC2 levels (16Dhar S.K. Yoshida K. Machida Y. Khaira P. Chaudhuri B. Wohlschlegel J.A. Leffak M. Yates J. Dutta A. Cell. 2001; 106: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we are not surprised to discover that many of the cells in the population have sufficient ORC2 for a normal S phase once the CDK cycle is de-repressed. However, apoptosis was observed in some of the cells, suggesting that CDK inhibition in ORC2-depleted cells can prevent catastrophic events due to premature S phase entry with fewer functional origins. In nearly 50% of the cells DNA synthesis was not restored despite the restoration of CDK2 activity, suggesting that in these cells the ORC2 levels were genuinely below a threshold sufficient for DNA replication. We think that differences in levels of residual ORC2 in various cells in the population account for the differences in the responses after de-repression of CDK2. Checkpoint Activation or Obligate Role of ORC in the CDK Cycle—There are two possible interpretations for the inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 activity in ORC-depleted cells. The first is that ORC is not normally required for CDK2 activation, but abnormally low levels of ORC activate emergency checkpoint pathways that prevent cyclin E-CDK2 activation and arrest the cell cycle in G1. The second possibility is that ORC has an obligate role in the normal activation of cyclin E-CDK2 even during the normal cell cycle. In this possibility, ORC-depleted cells fail to activate cyclin E-CDK2 resulting in cell cycle arrest in G1. We cannot at present distinguish between these possibilities. Dissecting mechanisms linking p21 and p27 accumulation to ORC2 depletion will help determine whether this is an emergency checkpoint mechanism or an obligate role of ORC in p21 and p27 regulation. Checkpoint-like Mechanism at G1/S—Cell cycle checkpoint is defined as a mechanism preventing initiation of the next step until the previous step is complete (31Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). Since activation of cyclin E-CDK2 triggers initiation of DNA replication in the normal situation, the fact that cyclin E-CDK2 is inhibited in response to low levels of ORC seems to fit with the idea of a cell cycle checkpoint. Consistent with this, restoration of CDK2 activity in ORC2-depleted cells by p27 and p21 RNAi lets the cell cycle progress into S phase or induce apoptosis. p21 and p27 are therefore effectors in a checkpoint pathway that prevent initiation of DNA replication until G1 events dependent on ORC function are complete. Alternatively, the checkpoint pathway might sense the ORC2 level directly. However, since ORC2 protein levels are unchanged during the cell cycle, we think it more likely that failure to complete G1 events involving ORC is somehow sensed to prevent premature entry into S phase. Consistent with this, blocking pre-RC assembly by overexpression of a stable form of geminin in primary cells inhibits CDK leading to the appearance of hypophosphorylated pRB (32Shreeram S. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Blow J.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that formation of pre-RCs is linked to CDK activation and allows cells to enter S phase once enough pre-RCs are formed. Normally p27 is transiently stabilized in early G1 phase and degraded in late G1 once CDK2 is active. Since this period of p27 stabilization overlaps with the time for pre-RC formation, we speculate that degradation of p27 is coupled to pre-RC formation. ORC Function in p27 Degradation—Xic1, a Xenopus homolog of p27, is ubiquitinylated by SCFSkp2 at origins of DNA replication in egg extracts and ORC depletion from extracts stabilizes Xic1 (33Furstenthal L. Swanson C. Kaiser B.K. Eldridge A.G. Jackson P.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 34You Z. Harvey K. Kong L. Newport J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1182-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The stabilization of human p27 after ORC depletion is consistent with this result. However, at the earliest time point when p27 is stabilized (24–36 h), we did not see any decrease in the chromatin association of Skp2 (data not shown). Although the exact mechanism of p27 stabilization is unclear, we are currently entertaining two hypotheses. When cells exit from G0, nuclear export of a small fraction of the p27 reduces the amount of p27 in nuclei and triggers activation of CDK2 (35Rodier G. Montagnoli A. Di Marcotullio L. Coulombe P. Draetta G.F. Pagano M. Meloche S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6672-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 36Ishida N. Hara T. Kamura T. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14355-14358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Once activated, CDK2 accelerates the degradation of p27 by phosphorylating it and targeting it to the SCF complex. If a similar export of p27 is necessary to jump-start the CDK cycle in the G1 phase of cycling cells, it is possible that such export is coupled to pre-RC formation. An alternative hypothesis is based on the role of ORC for formation of heterochromatin (37Prasanth S.G. Prasanth K.V. Siddiqui K. Spector D.L. Stillman B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2651-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 38Pak D.T. Pflumm M. Chesnokov I. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Marr J. Romanowski P. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 311-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Insufficient levels of ORC2 could therefore lead to changes in chromatin structure that result in changes in expression of genes regulating p27 stability. p21 Up-regulation after ORC2 Depletion—p21 was induced by a p53-independent pathway after ORC2 RNAi. Since overexpression of non-degradable form of geminin in primary cells also induces p21 in a p53-independent manner (32Shreeram S. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Blow J.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), p21 induction might be related to the failure to form pre-RCs. It has been reported that ORC is involved in gene silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (39Foss M. McNally F.J. Laurenson P. Rine J. Science. 1993; 262: 1838-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In addition, Drosophila and human ORC2 associate with HP1, a protein in heterochromatin (37Prasanth S.G. Prasanth K.V. Siddiqui K. Spector D.L. Stillman B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2651-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 38Pak D.T. Pflumm M. Chesnokov I. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Marr J. Romanowski P. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 311-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Therefore, as speculated above, ORC might regulate p21 mRNA levels by affecting gene expression. ORC-dependent CDK2 Activation and Genomic Stability— The results reported in this paper establish for the first time linkage between ORC and CDK2 activation in human cells. In retrospect, such a linkage seems essential for maintaining genomic stability. As a part of the mechanism to prevent rereplication, pre-RC formation is allowed only when CDK activity is low (40Dahmann C. Diffley J.F. Nasmyth K.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1257-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 41Hua X.H. Yan H. Newport J. J.

Therefore premature activation of CDK2 before sufficient origins are licensed would further inhibit pre-RC formation and irreversibly push the cells into S phase. Replication initiation from fewer origins might lead to chromosomal damage as seen in the yeasts (43Lengronne A. Schwob E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 44Tanaka S. Diffley J.F.

Cell. 2005; 120: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, ORC-dependent activation of CDK2 could have evolved to protect the mammalian cell from genetic instability resulting from premature activation of CDK2. ORC protein levels are low in quiescent tissues (46Thome K.C. Dhar S.K. Quintana D.G. Delmolino L. Shahsafaei A. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35233-35241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) so that cells emerging from quiescence have to accumulate ORC in preparation for the first S phase. It is interesting to speculate that by overriding the linkage between ORC abundance and cyclin E-CDK2 activity, overexpression of cyclin E is particularly deleterious to cells as they emerge from quiescence. Consistent with this, overexpression of cyclin E induces chromosomal instability in mammalian cells (47Spruck C.H. Won K.A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1999; 401: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), and many human tumors overexpress cyclin E (48Schraml P. Bucher C. Bissig H. Nocito A. Haas P. Wilber K. Seelig S. Kononen J. Mihatsch M.J. Dirnhofer S. Sauter G. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that pre-RC formation was severely impaired in cells expressing cyclin E at high levels (49Ekholm-Reed S. Mendez J. Tedesco D. Zetterberg A. Stillman B. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of proper regulation of cyclin E-CDK2 activity for chromosome stability. The recent creation of viable mice with CDK2 deletion raises questions as to whether CDK2 has an essential role in mammalian cells (50Berthet C. Aleem E. Coppola V. Tessarollo L. Kaldis P. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1775-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 51Ortega S. Prieto I. Odajima J. Martin A. Dubus P. Sotillo R. Barbero J.L. Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The yeast CDK is, however, essential for G1/S transition and plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing re-replication in one cell cycle. We therefore favor the hypothesis that the firing of origins and the prevention of re-replication both require CDK2 in mammals, but these actions are executed by one of the other mammalian CDKs in the CDK2 null mice. Thus, we believe that the requirement of ORC for the proper activation of CDK2 is likely to be an important feature of cell cycle control and genomic stability for mammalian cells in vivo. Finally, recent studies (37Prasanth S.G. Prasanth K.V. Siddiqui K. Spector D.L. Stillman B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2651-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 52Chesnokov I.N. Chesnokova O.N.

Science. 2002; 297: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) have implicated ORC in mitotic functions like chromosome condensation and segregation. The results reported here add to the cellular pathways and functions that are dependent on ORC and extend the interconnection between ORC and other players in the cell cycle machinery.

In addition to interacting stably with the activated TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) to prevent phosphorylation of the receptor-regulated Smads (Smad2 and Smad3), Smad7 also induces degradation of the activated TβRI through association with different E3 ubiquitin ligases. Using the two-hybrid screen, we identified atrophin 1-interacting protein 4 (AIP4) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that specifically targets Smad7 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation without affecting the turnover of the activated TβRI. Surprisingly, we found that despite the ability to degrade Smad7, AIP4 can inhibit TGF-β signaling, presumably by enhancing the association of Smad7 with the activated TβRI. Consistent with this notion, expression of a catalytic mutant of AIP4, which is unable to induce ubiquitination and degradation of Smad7, also stabilizes the TβRI·Smad7 complex, resulting in inhibition of TGF-β signaling. The ability of AIP4 to enhance the inhibitory function of Smad7 independent of its ubiquitin ligase activity reveals a new mechanism by which E3 ubiquitin ligases may function to turn off TGF-β signaling.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). TGF-β initiates signaling from the cell surface by contacting two distantly related transmembrane serine/threonine kinases called TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and TGF-β type II receptor. Upon ligand binding, the constitutively active TGF-β type II receptor phosphorylates and activates TβRI, leading to phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3 on two serines at the carboxyl terminus, within a highly conserved SSXS motif. Following phosphorylation, Smad2 and Smad3 associate with the shared partner Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus, where Smad complexes, in cooperation with coactivators, participate in transcriptional activation of target genes (1Heldin C.H.

Because of its critical role in cell fate determination, TGF-β signaling is subject to many levels of positive and negative regulation, targeting both the receptors and intracellular mediators. For example, TGF-β signaling can be attenuated by the antagonistic Smad, Smad7, which acts by interfering with the activation of Smad2 and Smad3 (2Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of Smad7-mediated repression of TGF-β signaling has been primarily attributed to the ability of Smad7 to form a stable association with the activated type I receptor, thereby preventing Smad2 and Smad3 from binding to and being phosphorylated by this receptor (7Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

Recently, several studies have suggested that Smad7 might associate with the E3 ubiquitin ligases Smurf1, Smurf2, and Tiul1 to target the TGF-β receptors for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (9Ebisawa T.

The ubiquitin conjugation system plays an important role in several biological processes, such as transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and cell stress responses, and represents one of the most important degradation systems in the cell (12Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Alterations in the activity of the ubiquitin system have been implicated in several human disorders, including malignant transformation and genetic diseases (13Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 40-51Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 14Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of a protein substrate usually requires three processes involving the ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3) (12Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 13Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. J. Cell.

A target protein must be tagged with a multiubiquitination chain composed of at least four ubiquitins before it can be recognized and degraded by the proteasome system. The specificity of protein ubiquitination is determined by E3 components, which function as adaptors that selectively bind substrates. There are two major classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases. One class carries a RING finger domain, and the other carries a homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) domain. RING finger E3s function as adaptor proteins, bringing the substrate to the ubiquitin-charged E2, whereas E3s of the HECT domain family participate directly in catalysis by forming a thiolester with ubiquitin during the ubiquitination reaction (12Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 13Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. J. Cell.

Smurf1, Smurf2, and Tiul1 contain the distinctive structural features of the HECT subclass of E3 ubiquitin ligases (16Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). These features include a phospholipid/calcium-binding C2 domain; WW domains, which mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to PPXY (PY) motifs on partner proteins; and a carboxyl-terminal HECT catalytic domain. By interacting with the PY motif of Smad7, Smurf1, Smurf2, and Tiul1 can be recruited to TGF-β receptors to induce their degradation (9Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T.

Structure-function analyses have indicated that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Smurf1, Smurf2, and Tiul1 plays an important role in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of TGF-β receptors·Smad7 complexes (9Ebisawa T.

L'Hoste S. Camonis J. Atfi A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3780-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The role of C2 domain in degradation is less clear. Deletion of this domain has no effect on Smad7 ubiquitination but causes a loss of ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the activated type I receptor by Smurf1 (17Suzuki C. Murakami G. Fukuchi M. Shimanuki T. Shikauchi Y. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39919-39925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The biochemical and functional characterization of Smurf1, Smurf2, and Tiul1 as partners of Smad7 that target TGF-β receptors for ubiquitin-dependent degradation is yielding a basic view of how E3 ubiquitin ligases may function to turn off TGF-β signaling. Here we identify atrophin 1-interacting protein 4 (AIP4), a member of the HECT subclass of E3 ubiquitin ligases (16Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), as a Smad7-binding protein and show that AIP4 functions in partnership with Smad7 to suppress TGF-β signaling. We provide evidence that AIP4 stabilizes the association between Smad7 and the activated type I receptor and does so by a mechanism that is independent of its ubiquitin ligase activity. These data thus define a novel function of E3 ubiquitin ligases as intracellular antagonists of the TGF-β type I receptor. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—DNA encoding full-length Smad7 was cloned into the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBT10. The resulting plasmid was used as bait in two-hybrid screens of a human placental cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the pGAD10 plasmid. Positive clones were selected by prototrophy for histidine and expression of β-galactosidase. Yeast DNA was recovered and transformed into Escherichia coli. Plasmids containing cDNA clones were identified by restriction mapping and further characterized by DNA sequencing using a Sequenase PCR sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Several partial cDNA displaying similarity to AIP4 were isolated by the two-hybrid screen, and one cDNA was used to screen a λZAP11 human placental cDNA library (Clontech) to obtain a full-length AIP4 cDNA clone. Expression Vectors—For AIP4 expression constructs, the open reading frame was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and subcloned into p3xFLAG-CMV-7 (Sigma) or pCruz-Myc (Santa Cruz) expression vectors. A PCR-based procedure was employed to generate the catalytically inactive ubiquitin ligase mutant of AIP4 in which Cys-830 was replaced with Ala. A similar method was employed to generate the ΔPY mutants of GAL4-Smad2 or GAL4-Smad3 in which the PPPGY sequence located in the linker region was deleted. Expression vectors for HA-Smad7, HA-Smad7Y211A, and HA-Smad7ΔPY were a gift from Dr. J. Wrana. Expression vectors for 6xMyc-Smad1, 6xMyc-Smad2, 6xMyc-Smad3, 6xMyc-Smad4, 6xMyc-Smad6, and 6xMyc-Smad7 were a gift from Dr. K. Miyazono. Expression vectors for 3xFLAG-Tiul1, 3xFLAG-Tiul11C890A, 3xFLAG-Smurf1, 3xFLAG-Smurf2, FLAG-Smad2, GAL4-Smad2, GAL4-Smad3, (CAGA)9-Lux, G5E1B-Lux, and wild-type (TβRI) or constitutively activated (TβRI.act) TGF-β type I receptor were previously described (11Seo S.R.

Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were transfected with expression vectors by the Lipofectamine method, and 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed at 4 °C in TNMG buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). For siRNA experiments, cells were transfected by the Lipofectamine (in the case of cotransfection with expression vectors) or the OligofectAMINE method. The siRNA sequence targeting AIP4 (GenBank™ accession number AF095745) is 5′-GGU-GAC-AAA-GAG-CCA-ACA-GAG-3′ and corresponds to nucleotides 190–211 relative to the start codon. The control siRNA corresponds to a scrambled siRNA. For the analysis of Smad7 ubiquitination, cells were resuspended in ubiquitination buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na PPi, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 100 ng/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) and lysed by sonication. In all cases, lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibody for 2 h, followed by adsorption to Sepharose-coupled protein G for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. For determination of total protein levels, aliquots of cell lysates were subjected to direct immunoblotting. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the indicated primary antibody. The bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Pulse-chase Analysis—For experiments examining the metabolic stability of Smad7 or TβRI, 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors by the Lipofectamine method, serum-starved for 18 h, preincubated for 1 h in Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and pulsed for 10 min with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys. The cells were then washed extensively with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and chased for the indicated time periods in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.2% fetal calf serum. The cells were then lysed in TNMG buffer containing protease inhibitors and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Gene Expression Analysis—For the reporter gene assays, cells were seeded into 6-well (35-mm) plates and transfected 24 h later with expression vectors by the Lipofectamine method. Cells were subsequently treated with human TGF-β1 (Sigma) at 80 pm for 16 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system described by the manufacturer (Promega) and normalized for transfection efficiency using a β-galactosidase-expressing vector (pCMV5.LacZ) and the Galacto-Star system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). AIP4 Interacts with Smad7—To gain insight into the mechanism of action of Smad7, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the entire mouse Smad7 as bait. By screening 50 × 106 clones of a human placental cDNA expression library, we obtained 10 different cDNA species from 106 positive clones. AIP4 was one of the Smad7 interactors isolated, and it exhibited specific and strong binding to Smad7 in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown). AIP4 has significant homology to the HECT subclass E3 ubiquitin ligases, which selectively target protein for ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome (16Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Other class E3 ubiquitin ligases include Smurf1, Smurf2, and Tiul1, which associate with Smad7 to target the TGF-β receptor for degradation (9Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K.

A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). AIP4 shares with Smurf1, Smurf2, and Tiul1 distinctive structural features, including a phospholipid/calcium-binding C2 domain, WW protein-protein interaction domains, and a HECT domain that catalyzes ubiquitination on target proteins (Fig. 1A). To confirm the interaction of AIP4 and Smad7 in mammalian cells, we expressed a FLAG epitope-tagged version of AIP4 in 293 cells together with a Myc-tagged version of Smad7. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with the anti-Myc antibody revealed the presence of FLAG-AIP4, which was absent in a control transfection in which only FLAG-AIP4 was expressed (Fig. 1B). In a reciprocal fashion, the association between AIP4 and Smad7 could also be demonstrated when cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody directed toward AIP4 followed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody for the presence of Smad7 (Fig. 1B). To test the specificity of the interaction of AIP4 with Smad7, 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-AIP4 together with Myc-tagged versions of Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, Smad6, and Smad7. In immunoprecipitates of cells expressing either Smad6 or Smad7, efficient coprecipitation of either Smad with AIP4 was observed (Fig. 1C). In contrast, none of the other Smads coprecipitated with AIP4, despite efficient expression of these Smad proteins (Fig. 1C). Specific binding of AIP4 to both Smad6 and Smad7 is consistent with the observation that these two proteins possess very closely related MH2 domains and are both inhibitors of TGF-β signaling pathways (2Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain the physiological relevance of these interactions, we next investigated whether endogenous complexes between AIP4 and Smad7 proteins might be found in mammalian cells. For this, a polyclonal antibody against AIP4 was raised by injecting rabbits with a polypeptide corresponding to the region of AIP4 from amino acids 220–230. Western blot analysis of 293 cells transfected with empty vector or FLAG-AIP4 showed that the antibody recognizes both endogenous AIP4 and FLAG-AIP4 (Fig. 1D, left panel). To characterize the endogenous AIP4-Smad7 association, Smad7 was immunoprecipitated with a specific Smad7 antibody, and AIP4 was visualized by immunoblotting with the anti-AIP4 antibody. In immunoprecipitates prepared with preimmune antisera, no AIP4 was detectable (Fig. 1D, right panel). However, in the anti-Smad7 immunoprecipitates, we could clearly detect AIP4 coprecipitating with Smad7 (Fig. 1D, right panel), providing evidence that the association of AIP4 and Smad7 can occur with physiological levels of these proteins. To examine whether activation of TGF-β signaling might influence the interaction of AIP4 with Smad7, COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-AIP4, Myc-Smad7, and either wild-type or activated TβRI (TβRI.act), which contains a substitution of Thr residue 204 to Asp and signals TGF-β responses in the absence of ligand and the type II receptor (23Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In the absence of TGF-β signaling, a strong interaction between AIP4 and Smad7 was detected. Furthermore, the level of this interaction in cells transfected with wild-type receptors was comparable to that observed with the constitutively activated type I receptor, indicating that Smad7 associates with AIP4 independently of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 1E). A similar conclusion could be drawn from 293 cells transfected with AIP4 and Smad7 and treated with TGF-β (see Fig. 5C). To begin to understand the interaction of AIP4 and Smad7, various FLAG epitope-tagged AIP4 constructs (Fig. 2A) were transfected into 293 cells and tested for interaction with cotransfected Myc-Smad7. As shown in Fig. 2B, loss of the first 100 amino acids, which includes the C2 motif, did not interfere with AIP4 binding to Smad7, whereas further deletions that remove the WW1 and WW2 motifs completely abolished the interaction. A similar analysis of carboxyl-terminal truncations revealed that the WW3, WW4, and HECT domains did not associate with AIP4, thereby indicating that the WW1 and WW2 domains in AIP4 are required to mediate binding to Smad7 (Fig. 2B). We also characterized the domains in Smad7 that mediate binding to AIP4 protein. It is noteworthy that Smad7 contains a PPPY sequence, which is a conserved motif (PY motif) that can mediate interaction with WW domains such as those found in AIP4. To determine whether Smad7 associates with AIP4 through its PY motif, we employed two Smad7 PY motif mutants, one (Smad7Y211A) with the conserved Tyr residue in the PY motif mutated to Ala, and another (Smad7ΔPY) with the PPPY sequence deleted. In initial experiments, it was difficult to compare the efficiency of interaction of AIP4 with wild-type Smad7 or Smad7 PY motif mutants because expression of wild-type AIP4 dramatically decreased the steady-state level of wild-type Smad7, presumably by targeting Smad7 for degradation through the proteasome (see below). Consequently, we generated an inactive mutant of AIP4 (AIP4C830A), in which the Cys that is believed to conjugate ubiquitin was replaced by an Ala. In contrast to wild-type Smad7, the Smad7PY motif mutants failed to interact with AIP4C830A (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it is likely that AIP4 associates with Smad7 through interactions between the WW1 and WW2 domains of AIP4 and the PY motif in Smad7. AIP4 Specifically Induces the Degradation of Smad7—In the previous experiments, we often observed that the steady-state levels of Smad7 were reduced in cells coexpressing AIP4 (Fig. 1, B and E). This effect of AIP4 depended on the amount of AIP4 protein expressed in the cells (Fig. 3A) and was not observed for Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 (Fig. 3B), which are defective in their ability to interact with AIP4 (Fig. 1C; see also Fig. 5C). Because expression of the catalytically inactive ubiquitin ligase mutant of AIP4, AIP4C830A, does not alter the steady-state levels of Smad7 (Fig. 3C), we considered the possibility that AIP4 might target Smad7 for ubiquitination, with subsequent degradation through the proteasome. First, we performed an analysis of the half-life of transfected Smad7 by pulse-chase experiments. As shown in Fig. 3D, coexpression of AIP4 dramatically enhanced the turnover of Smad7 protein. We also determined whether AIP4 enhances Smad7 turnover through its ability to induce ubiquitination of Smad7. For this, 293 cells were transfected with a vector coding for His-tagged ubiquitin together with HA-Smad7, in the presence or absence of AIP4. As shown in Fig. 3E, Smad7 ubiquitination occurred exclusively in the presence of His-ubiquitin, and, as expected, AIP4 notably enhanced Smad7 ubiquitination. Under these experimental conditions, cotransfection of similar amounts of the catalytic inactive mutant AIP4C830A did not yield ubiquitinated Smad7 (Fig. 3E), which is consistent with the notion that AIP4 acts as an ubiquitin ligase to induce the degradation of Smad7. To further confirm a role for AIP4 in the degradation of Smad7, we employed siRNA to reduce endogenous levels of AIP4. 293 cells were transfected with either a control siRNA or an AIP4-specific siRNA. The AIP4 siRNA effectively reduced AIP4 expression compared with vehicle- or control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 3F). Western blotting analysis with anti-Smad7 antibody demonstrated that the reduction of AIP4 is associated with an increase in the expression levels of endogenous Smad7 (Fig. 3F), providing further support for the physiological function of AIP4 as a ubiquitin ligase that targets Smad7 for degradation. In the course of these experiments, we also confirmed that the degradation of Smad7 by AIP4 can occur by a mechanism that is independent of TGF-β signaling. Moreover, we observed that expression of AIP4 siRNA had no effect on the expression levels (Fig. 3F) or ubiquitination of the activated TGF-β type I receptor (data not shown). AIP4 Inhibits the TGF-β Signal Transduction Pathway— Having shown that AIP4 can interact with Smad7 and mediate ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of this inhibitory Smad, we set out to investigate the functional importance of AIP4 in TGF-β signaling. To test this, we examined the effects of ectopically expressed AIP4 on the luciferase CAGA reporter plasmid (CAGA)9-Lux, which contains concatamerized CAGA elements previously shown to bind complexes of Smad3 and Smad4 and to be transactivated by both TGF-β and Smad3/Smad4 expression (24Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, expression of AIP4 resulted in a marked reduction in TGF-β-stimulated luciferase activity. Moreover, coexpression of AIP4 synergizes with Smad7 to inhibit TGF-β-induced (CAGA)9-Lux activity. A similar conclusion could be drawn when the heterologous GAL4 reporter (G5E1B-Lux), and GAL4-Smad2 was used in these analyses (Fig. 4B). We also investigated the effects of the AIP4 siRNA and found that the reduction in endogenous AIP4 is associated with an increase in TGF-β-induced gene expression from the (CAGA)9-Lux reporter (Fig. 4C). Thus, AIP4 appears to act as an inhibitor of TGF-β-induced Smad-dependent transcription. Previous studies have shown that the E3 ubiquitin ligases Smurf1, Smurf2, and Tiul1 interact with Smad7 to induce ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the activated type I receptor (9Ebisawa T.

As a first step to elucidate the mechanism by which AIP4 induces suppression of TGF-β signaling, we examined whether AIP4 may function similarly to Smurf1, Smurf2, and Tiul1. As shown in Fig. 5A, coexpression of AIP4 and TGF-β type I receptor, in either the presence or absence of Smad7, did not alter steady-state levels of type I receptor. As a control, we observed that Smurf1, Smurf2, or Tiul1 can act in conjunction with Smad7 to target the activated type I receptor for degradation (Fig. 5A). Pulse-chase analysis also confirmed that the turnover rate of the bulk of type I receptor was unaffected by coexpression of Smad7 (Fig. 5B, top panel).

Because two mammalian isoforms of iPLA2 (iPLA2β and iPLA2 γ) have been cloned and characterized, the aim of this study was to identify the specific isoform(s) in macrophages that regulates the expression of iNOS in response to virus infection. Bromoenol lactone (BEL), a suicide substrate inhibitor of iPLA2, inhibits the activity of both isoforms at low micromolar concentrations. However, the R- and S-enantiomers of BEL display ∼10-fold greater potency for inhibition of the enzymatic activity of iPLA2γ and iPLA2β, respectively. In this study, we show that the iPLA2β-selective (S)-BEL inhibits encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)-induced iNOS expression, nitric oxide production, and iPLA2 enzymatic activity in macrophages in a concentration-related manner that closely resembles the inhibitory properties of racemic BEL. cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is one downstream target of iPLA2 that is required for the transcriptional activation of iNOS in response to virus infection, and consistent with the effects of BEL enantiomers on iNOS expression, (S)-BEL more effectively inhibits EMCV-induced CREB phosphorylation than (R)-BEL in macrophages. Using macrophages isolated from iPLA2β-null mice, virus infection fails to stimulate iNOS mRNA accumulation and protein expression, thus providing genetic evidence that iPLA2β is required for EMCV-induced iNOS expression.

PKR, a 65-68-kDa serine-threonine protein kinase, is activated by binding to dsRNA that accumulates during viral infection and coordinates the antiviral response by inhibiting protein translation, up-regulating antiviral and proinflammatory gene expression, and inducing apoptosis (1Gale Jr., M.

A. 1999; 96: 11693-11695Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). PKR suppresses protein translation in virus-infected cells by phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α, whereas PKR-mediated gene transcription appears to be due to activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor (NF)-κB (3Kumar A.

Whereas the regulation of the antiviral response has classically been thought to be mediated by PKR, recent reports support the existence of additional PKR-independent pathways that participate in antiviral activities within infected cells. In particular, treatment of PKR-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts with dsRNA or infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) stimulates inhibitory protein κB (IκBα) degradation as well as NF-κB nuclear localization, DNA binding activity, and promoter activation, suggesting that PKR is not absolutely required for virus-induced activation of NF-κB-mediated gene expression (4Iordanov M.S.

In an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate proinflammatory gene expression in macrophages during viral infection, we have recently identified a role for calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) in a novel PKR-independent signaling pathway that participates in the transcriptional regulation of iNOS (7Maggi Jr., L.B. Moran J.M. Scarim A.L. Ford D.A. Yoon J.W. McHowat J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38449-38455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Treatment of macrophages with dsRNA or infection with EMCV results in an increase in membrane-associated iPLA2 enzymatic activity and iNOS mRNA accumulation and protein expression. The suicide substrate inhibitor of iPLA2, bromoenol lactone (BEL), inhibits EMCV-induced iPLA2 activation and iNOS expression in a concentration-dependent manner, supporting a role for iPLA2 in the regulation of iNOS expression by macrophages. The mechanism by which iPLA2 mediates the transcriptional activation of iNOS appears to be associated with membrane phospholipid hydrolysis and liberation of a lipid-derived mediator that is capable of activating downstream signaling targets that participate in the expression of iNOS. Importantly, we have shown that the inhibitory effects of BEL on dsRNA-induced iNOS expression by RAW264.7 cells can be overcome by the exogenous addition of a lipid product resembling those generated by iPLA2 activity, lysoplasmenylcholine (7Maggi Jr., L.B.

Historically, the functions of iPLA2 have been delineated and characterized primarily by sensitivity to the suicide substrate inhibitor BEL. Although BEL is 1000-fold more selective for iPLA2 than other phospholipases (20Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

Studies by Gross and co-workers (22Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) have shown that (R)-BEL is 10-fold more selective for iPLA2γ, whereas (S)-BEL is 10-fold more selective for iPLA2β. However, it is important to note that BEL enantiomers do not display absolute specificity for iPLA2 isoforms because a significantly high enough concentration of either (R)- or (S)-BEL will inhibit both iPLA2β and iPLA2γ. Accordingly, when used at submaximally effective concentrations, the differential sensitivity of iPLA2 isoforms to inhibition by the enantiomers of BEL allows for the identification of the iPLA2 isoform that mediates a given biological response. Using this pharmacological approach, the identity of the iPLA2 isoform(s) that mediates the antiviral response of iNOS expression by macrophages was examined. We show that EMCV-induced iNOS expression and nitrite production by RAW264.7 cells and primary macrophages are more sensitive to inhibition by (S)-BEL than (R)-BEL. Furthermore, EMCV-induced iPLA2 activity and the downstream phosphorylation and activation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor essential for virus-induced iNOS expression, are attenuated by (S)-BEL but largely unaffected by the presence of (R)-BEL at similar concentrations. Using a genetic approach to confirm these findings, we show that EMCV-induced iNOS expression and nitrite production are abolished in iPLA2β-/- macrophages as compared with wild-type macrophages. These studies support a primary role for iPLA2β in the regulation of virus-induced iNOS expression by macrophages.

Antibody dilutions were as follows: rabbit anti-iNOS, 1:1000; rabbit anti-STAT, 1:1000; rabbit anti-phospho-CREB, 1:1000; rabbit anti-ERK2, 1:1000; mouse anti-IL-1β, 1:2000; mouse anti-GAPDH, 1:5000; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, 1:5000; and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, 1:5000. Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—Autoradiograms were scanned into National Institutes of Health Image Version 1.59 using a COHU high performance charge-coupled device camera (Brookfield, WI), and band intensities were determined using National Institutes of Health Image Version 1.59 software. Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis and reported when p ≤ 0.05. Macrophages Express iPLA2β and iPLA2γ—Virus infection has been reported to increase membrane phospholipid metabolism by accelerated phospholipid catabolism, although the specific enzymes participating in the cellular response to viral infection were not known with certainty (30Horrocks L.A.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Consistent with these early reports, we have shown that treatment of macrophages with the viral dsRNA mimetic poly(IC) results in a 4-fold increase in membrane-associated iPLA2 activity that is sensitive to inhibition by BEL. In a similar concentration-related manner, BEL also attenuates poly(IC)- and EMCV-induced iNOS expression by macrophages (7Maggi Jr., L.B. Moran J.M. Scarim A.L. Ford D.A. Yoon J.W. McHowat J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38449-38455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whereas these studies provide evidence to support a role for iPLA2 in the antiviral response of iNOS expression by macrophages, the specific isoform of iPLA2 activated by virus infection that contributes to the transcriptional regulation of iNOS has yet to be established. Two mammalian forms of iPLA2 have been characterized, and both are expressed in macrophages under basal conditions and following a 6-h infection with EMCV as determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 1). Similar to RAW264.7 cells, peritoneal macrophages express both isoforms of iPLA2, and EMCV infection fails to modulate the expression of either isoform (data not shown). To confirm that the iPLA2γ PCR product was specific and not due to amplification of a homologous sequence of iPLA2β cDNA, an iPLA2β-encoding plasmid (iPLA2β-pDONR) was used as the DNA template, and primers for iPLA2β but not iPLA2γ produced a PCR product of the predicted size. These findings indicate that the iPLA2γ PCR product is specific and not due to mispriming or erroneous amplification of iPLA2β cDNA. In addition, sequence analysis was used to confirm the identity of each PCR product (data not shown). These results indicate that macrophages express both iPLA2β and iPLA2γ and suggest that either isoform could potentially participate in the regulation of virus-induced iNOS expression. (S)-BEL Inhibits EMCV-induced iNOS Expression and Nitrite Production by Macrophages—We have recently shown that treatment of macrophages with the viral dsRNA mimetic poly(IC) or infection with EMCV results in iNOS expression and nitrite production, events that are inhibited in a concentration-related manner by the iPLA2 inhibitors BEL and arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (7Maggi Jr., L.B. Moran J.M. Scarim A.L. Ford D.A. Yoon J.W. McHowat J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38449-38455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Until recently, it was impossible to distinguish biological effects mediated by an individual isoform of iPLA2 pharmacologically using BEL because the racemic mixture inhibits both iPLA2β and iPLA2γ enzymatic activity at low micromolar concentrations (15Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of BEL have, however, recently been shown to selectively inhibit individual iPLA2 isoforms in a narrow concentration range (22Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because the selectivity of these enantiomers for iPLA2β and iPLA2γ is not absolute and is decidedly dependent upon concentration, we used submaximally effective concentrations of (R)-BEL and (S)-BEL to determine their differential effects on virus-induced iNOS expression by macrophages. Because EMCV infection induces membrane-associated iPLA2 enzymatic activity, and iPLA2γ resides primarily in peroxisomes and mitochondria (15Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we postulated that iPLA2γ may participate in the antiviral response and that virus-induced iNOS expression would be inhibited by (R)-BEL. To examine this possibility, the inhibitory actions of racemic BEL, as well as the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of BEL, on EMCV-induced nitric oxide production (Fig. 2A) and iNOS expression (Fig. 2B) were examined. Racemic BEL and (S)-BEL inhibit EMCV-induced nitrite production and iNOS expression by RAW264.7 cells in a similar concentration-related manner with >70% inhibition at 5 μm. In contrast, (R)-BEL is much less effective at inhibiting EMCV-induced nitrite production and iNOS expression, with <40% inhibition at 5 μm. Similar to RAW264.7 cells, racemic BEL and (S)-BEL inhibit EMCV + IFN-γ-induced nitrite production and iNOS expression by primary macrophages to similar levels, whereas (R)-BEL fails to significantly inhibit nitric oxide production and iNOS expression (Fig. 3). Alone, (R)-BEL, (S)-BEL, or racemic BEL does not modulate basal nitrite production by RAW264.7 cells or primary mouse macrophages (data not shown). Because (S)-BEL is 10-fold more selective for iPLA2β than iPLA2γ, and (S)-BEL is significantly more effective at inhibiting EMCV- and EMCV + IFN-γ-induced nitrite production and iNOS expression by macrophages than (R)-BEL (Figs. 2 and 3), these findings suggest that iPLA2β is likely the predominant isoform that participates in the regulation of iNOS expression by macrophages.Fig. 3(S)-BEL inhibits EMCV-induced nitrite production and iNOS expression by primary macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages (4 × 105 cells/400 μl DMEM) were preincubated for 30 min with racemic BEL, (R)-BEL, or (S)-BEL; EMCV (1 pfu/cell) and mouse IFN-γ (150 units/ml) were added; and the cells were cultured for 24 h. Culture supernatants were isolated for determination of nitrite formation (A), and Western blot analysis of cell lysates was performed to determine iNOS expression (B). Blots were subsequently stripped and reprobed for ERK2 as a loading control. Results of nitrite production represent the mean ± S.E. for three independent experiments, and results of iNOS expression are representative of three independent experiments. *, p ≤ 0.05 as compared with EMCV + vehicle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (S)-BEL Inhibits dsRNA-induced iPLA2 Enzymatic Activity—iPLA2 has historically been ascribed a homeostatic role in membrane phospholipid maintenance, and thus there is a basal level of iPLA2 enzymatic activity present in unstimulated macrophages. However, in previous studies, we have shown that dsRNA stimulates a membrane-associated phospholipase activity in macrophages that is inhibited by racemic BEL at concentrations (1-5 μm) that also inhibit iNOS expression (7Maggi Jr., L.B. Moran J.M. Scarim A.L. Ford D.A. Yoon J.W. McHowat J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38449-38455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous findings, treatment of macrophages for 30 min with the viral mimetic poly(IC) results in a 3-fold increase in membrane-associated iPLA2 activity, and this activation is sensitive to inhibition by racemic BEL and (S)-BEL at a concentration of 5 μm (Fig. 4). At this concentration, racemic BEL and (S)-BEL attenuate dsRNA- and EMCV-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production (Fig. 1). However, the iPLA2γ-selective (R)-BEL fails to attenuate dsRNA-stimulated iPLA2 activity at a concentration of 5 μm. In a similar manner, racemic BEL and (S)-BEL,"

Overexpression of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), several gain-of-function mutations in the FGFR3, and constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK1) in chondrocytes have been shown to cause dwarfism in mice by activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. To investigate the previously reported inhibitory role of Spred in the FGFR3/MAPK pathway, we generated mice with a trapped Spred-2 gene. Here we show that lack of functional Spred-2 protein in mice caused a dwarf phenotype, similar to achondroplasia, the most common form of human dwarfism. Spred-2-/- mice showed reduced growth and body weight, they had a shorter tibia length, and showed narrower growth plates as compared with wild-type mice. We detected promoter activity and protein expression of Spred-2 in chondrocytes, suggesting an important function of Spred-2 in chondrocytes and bone development. Stimulation of chondrocytes with different FGF concentrations showed earlier and augmented ERK phosphorylation in Spred-2-/- chondrocytes in comparison to Spred-2+/+ chondrocytes. Our observations suggest a model in which loss of Spred-2 inhibits bone growth by inhibiting chondrocyte differentiation through up-regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway.

Our observations suggest a model in which loss of Spred-2 inhibits bone growth by inhibiting chondrocyte differentiation through up-regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Long bone growth is determined mainly by the process of endochondral ossification, a strictly regulated process that requires proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes. During this process, chondrocytes in the reserve zone that arise from mesenchymal cells first undergo proliferation, they then exit the cell cycle, undergo terminal hypertrophic differentiation, and finally the synthesized cartilage matrix calcifies and is replaced by bone (1.Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Various signaling molecules have been shown to regulate and coordinate this complex process of endochondral ossification.

FGFs are a large family of at least 23 polypeptides that signal through their binding to specific tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs), which constitute a four-member gene family (3.Basilico C.

In contrast, lack of FGFR3 in mice causes skeletal overgrowth, indicating that FGFR3 signaling inhibits endochondral bone growth (18.Colvin J.S. Bohne B.A. Harding G.W. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Nat.

Recently, it has been shown that constitutive activation of MEK1 in chondrocytes causes Stat1-independent achondroplasia-like dwarfism in mice and rescues the FGFR3-deficient mouse phenotype (32.Murakami S. Balmes G. McKinney S. Zhang Z. Givol D. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 290-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Overexpression of C-type natriuretic peptide in chondrocytes counteracts dwarfism in a mouse model of achondroplasia with activated FGFR3 in cartilage. C-type natriuretic peptide prevented the shortening of achondroplastic bones by correcting the decreased extracellular matrix synthesis in the growth plate through inhibition of the FGF-mediated MAPK pathway (33.Yasoda A. Komatsu Y. Chusho H. Miyazawa T. Ozasa A. Miura M. Kurihara T. Rogi T. Tanaka S. Suda M. Tamura N. Ogawa Y. Nakao K. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Growth hormone therapy in achondroplasia patients has beneficial effects through insulin-like growth factor-1 by preventing chondrogenic cell apoptosis induced by an activating mutation in the FGFR3 (34.Koike M. Yamanaka Y. Inoue M. Tanaka H. Nishimura R. Seino Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 2043-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results indicate that MAPK activity is a negative regulator of bone growth and suggest that the MAPK pathway plays an important role in bone development. Despite recent advances in understanding the roles of FGFs and FGF receptors in skeletal development, the downstream events through which FGFs influence the proliferation or differentiation of osteogenic chondrocytes remain to be elucidated. Spreds have been described as a new Sprouty-related family of membrane-associated physiological inhibitors of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway by interacting with Ras and Raf-1 (35.Wakioka T. Sasaki A.

Spreds contain an N-terminal EVH-1 (Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology-1) domain, a c-Kit binding domain (KBD), and a C-terminal Sprouty-like cysteine-rich domain (SPR domain). Sprouty from Drosophila was identified as a negative regulator of growth factor-induced ERK activation (36.Minowada G. Jarvis L.A. Chi C.L. Neubuser A. Sun X. Hacohen N. Krasnow M.A. Martin G.R.

So far, three mammalian Spred family members have been identified: Spred-1 was found to be expressed in fetal tissues, brain, heart, and to a minor extent in other tissues. Spred-2 expression was found to be more ubiquitous, whereas Spred-3 expression was restricted to the brain (41.Kato R. Nonami A. Taketomi T. Wakioka T. Kuroiwa A. Matsuda Y. Yoshimura A. Biochem.

During rat lung development, Spred-1 and Spred-2 mRNAs were shown to be expressed predominantly in mesenchymal tissue from the onset of lung branching and co-expression of FGF-10 was demonstrated in the same region (43.Hashimoto S. Nakano H. Singh G. Katyal S. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: S303-S309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the aorta-gonado-mesonephros region of midgestation mouse embryos, Spred-2 activity negatively regulates aorta-gonado-mesonephros hematopoiesis (44.Nobuhisa I. Kato R. Inoue H. Takizawa M. Okita K. Yoshimura A. Taga T. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was shown that Spreds play a role as key regulators of RhoA-mediated cell motility and signal transduction. Spred-1 binds to activated RhoA and inhibits chemokine-induced RhoA activation and active RhoA-induced Rho kinase activation. By this mechanism, Spred inhibits cell motility, metastasis, and Rho-mediated actin reorganization (40.Miyoshi K. Wakioka T. Nishinakamura H. Kamio M. Yang L. Inoue M. Hasegawa M. Yonemitsu Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that Spred-1 is also highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and negatively regulates stem cell factor- and interleukin 3-mediated ERK/MAP kinase activation. Wild-type Spred-1 inhibits colony formation of bone marrow cells in the presence of cytokines, whereas a ΔC-Spred-1 dominant negative mutant enhances colony formation (45.Nonami A. Kato R.

So far, a function of Spred in the regulation of bone growth has not been shown and the in vivo functions of Spred in the whole organism still remained to be elucidated. Therefore, we generated a mouse strain with a disruption of the Spred-2 gene. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of Spred-2 as an inhibitor of the FGF-induced MAPK signaling pathway in regulation of endochondral ossification during bone development. Gene Trapping and Southern Blot Analysis—To disrupt the Spred-2 gene in mice, we generated a mouse strain, using the XB228 embryonic stem cell line with the pGTO gene trap vector inserted between exons 4 and 5 (Baygenomics, San Francisco, CA). Vector insertion was confirmed by X-gal staining according to the protocol given by the Sanger Institute Gene Trap Resource (www.sanger.ac.uk/PostGenomics/genetrap/protocols.shtml), and single insertion of the gene trap vector was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The Southern probe was a 630-bp fragment of the engrailed 2 intron 1 gene trap vector sequence, which was amplified with the following primers: forward, 5′-AGATGCCAGAGACTCAGTGAAGCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTCTTTGGTTTTCGGGACCTGG-3′. 10 μg of genomic XB228 DNA was digested with BglII, cutting once within the entire gene trap vector sequence, separated by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted, and hybridized with the radiolabeled probe. After confirmation of single integration of the gene trap vector into the Spred-2 gene, XB228 ES cells were used to generate germ line chimeras, which were mated to C57Bl/6 wild-type mice to obtain heterozygous Spred-2+/- mice. Completely Spred-2-deficient mice and littermate controls of a mixed 129/Ola × C57Bl/6 background were used in this study. Genotyping of Mice—Offspring were genotyped using the following sets of primers: for WT PCR, amplifying a 1600-bp fragment, primer 1 (5′-GCTTGACCGGCACCCCGGTGAG-3′) and primer 3 (5′-TAGAAGAACTGTCCGTAGCTGT-3′), for knockout PCR, amplifying a 2700-bp fragment, primers 1 and 2 (5′-TTCTTTGGTTTTCGGGACCTGG-3′). For approximate positions of primers see Fig. 1. RT-PCR and Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from different mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 1 ml of TRIzol reagent was used for 30 mg of tissue and RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR analyses, 1 μg of total RNA was used with the OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). Specific primer sequences for Spred-2 were: 5′ Spr2-(1-28), 5′-ATGACCGAAGAAACACACCCGGACGATG-3′, and 3′ Spr2-(1233-1207), 5′-TCACGCGGCGGCTTTGTGCTTCCCACC-3′. To test for RNA integrity, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragment was amplified in parallel, using the following primers: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of each total RNA sample was separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled full-length Spred-2 cDNA probe (Megaprime DNA labeling system, Amersham). Hybridization signals were detected on x-ray films. Western Blotting—Mouse tissue lysates were prepared in homogenization buffer (10 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, Complete protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Diagnostics) and protein concentrations were estimated by Lowry reagent (Sigma). Cells were counted (Coulter counter), and lysates were prepared in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry system (Bio-Rad). For Western blot analyses, the following antibodies were used: affinity purified polyclonal rabbit anti-Spred-2 (AS 96-415 (42.Engelhardt C.M. Bundschu K. Messerschmitt M. Renne T. Walter U. Reinhard M. Schuh K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 122: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)), polyclonal goat anti-actin (catalog number sc-1616, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit anti-ERK (catalog number 9102, Cell Signaling Technology), monoclonal rabbit anti-phospho-ERK (catalog number 4376, Cell Signaling Technology), peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova), and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For signal detection, the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Histological Examination (X-Gal Staining, Immunohistology, Toluidine Staining)—For X-gal stainings, newborn mice and tibiae of P7 mice were snap frozen in 2-methylbutane. Cryosections (5-10 μm) were fixed in X-gal fixation buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3 (3.74 g of NaH2PO4-H2O, FW = 137.99; 10.35 g of Na2HPO4, relative molecular weight = 141.96; in 1 liter H2O), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2% glutaraldehyde) for 15 min, washed 3 times with X-gal wash buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 2 mm MgCl2), and stained overnight at 37 °C in X-gal staining buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 3H2O, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 1 mg/ml X-gal). Stained sections were washed 3 times with X-gal wash buffer and mounted in Aquatex (Merck). For immunohistochemistry, mouse tissues were snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane with liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (5-10 μm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, and blocked with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at room temperature, washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody. The following antibodies were used: affinity purified anti-Spred-2 and Cy3™-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Transduction Laboratories). To test for nonspecific binding of the secondary antibodies, only the secondary Cy3-labeled antibody was used. For histopathology, skeletons were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 18 h at 4 °C. After dehydration, the undecalcified tibiae were embedded in methylmetacrylate, and 5-μm sections were cut in the sagittal plane on a rotation microtome (Cut 4060E, MicroTech, Munich, Germany). Sections were stained with toluidine blue and evaluated using a Carl Zeiss microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) as described (47.Amling M. Priemel M. Holzmann T. Chapin K. Rueger J.M. Baron R. Demay M.B. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4982-4987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Estimation of Bone Lengths—To measure bone lengths, isolated legs were examined by soft x-rays. Statistical analyses were calculated by Student's t test. Cell Culture—Sterni and costal cartilage were dissected from pups at P1. Tissues were cut into small pieces and incubated in 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h at 37 °C. Dissociated cells were counted, and 6 × 105 cells/well were plated on 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS. After 2 days, cells were starved in serum-free media for 20 h and stimulated with serum-free media containing 1% FCS, 10% FCS, or 10 μg/ml heparin (Roth) with acidic fibroblast growth factor (Calbiochem, catalog number 341591) at the concentrations indicated. Generation of Spred-2-deficient Mice—To generate Spred-2-deficient mice, an embryonic stem cell clone with a disrupted Spred-2 gene, XB228 (Baygenomics), was used for blastocyst injection. Chimeric male offspring were then mated to wild-type C57Bl/6 mice to test for germ line transmission of the disrupted Spred-2 allele. Inbreeding of heterozygous offspring resulted in a slightly altered Mendelian ratio of 33.33% wild type, 41.03% heterozygous, and 25.64% knock-out mice (n = 195 in total). The gene trap vector pGTO in the XB228 ES cell line was inserted between exons 4 and 5 of the Spred-2 gene and the point of insertion was further defined by PCR and sequencing (Fig. 1A). Single integration of the gene trap vector into the genome was analyzed by Southern blotting. Therefore, genomic DNA was digested with BglII and part of the pGTO vector was used as the radioactive probe (Fig. 1A). Appearance of only one additional band in knock-out and heterozygous mice pointed toward a single integration of the gene trap vector. The upper band in the blot, which was also present in wild-type DNA, is related to the endogenous engrailed 2 gene, as the vector probe is part of the en2 intron 1 (Fig. 1B). Offspring were genotyped by PCR analyses using primers 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A) for the knock-out PCR and primers 1 and 3 (Fig. 1A) for the wild-type PCR (Fig. 1C). Male and female knock-out mice were fertile and inbred matings resulted in viable offspring, although litters were smaller (average litter size 4.4 pups, ranging from 3 to 7), compared with litters of wild-type breeding pairs (average 8.4, ranging from 5 to 12). In general, life expectancy, nesting, and nursing behavior of knock-out mice was indistinguishable compared with their littermates. Spred-2 Deficiency in Knock-out Mice on RNA and Protein Level—Successful disruption of the Spred-2 gene in Spred-2-/- mice was tested at both RNA and protein levels. Total RNA of different organs derived from Spred-2-deficient and wild-type mice was subjected to RT-PCR using specific primers for Spred-2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Loss of Spred-2 mRNA was confirmed in all samples tested (Fig. 2A). Northern blot analyses of brain, representing the organ with the strongest natural Spred-2 expression, revealed no apparent forms of Spred-2 mRNAs in total RNA preparations of Spred-2-/- mice (Fig. 2B). To examine Spred-2 deficiency at the protein level, Western blots were performed with affinity purified polyclonal rabbit anti-Spred-2 antibodies. As above, brain lysates of wild-type and Spred-2-/- mice were used as indicator tissues, because brain represents the organ with the highest Spred-2 expression levels. Specificity of antiserum was confirmed with lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with expression constructs for Spred-1 and -2. At the protein level, lack of Spred-2 protein in Spred-2-/- mice indicates functional loss of Spred-2 (Fig. 2C). Gene Disruption of Spred-2 Causes Achondroplasia-like Dwarfism—Homozygous Spred-2 deficiency resulted in clearly reduced body length and low body weight as compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 3A). Soft x-ray exposures revealed a smaller skeleton of knock-outs being in line with the observed growth retardation (Fig. 3B). Measurements of body weights of male (Fig. 3C) and female (Fig. 3D) wild-type and knock-out mice at the age of 20-160 days demonstrated the trend toward dwarfism. Spred-2-deficient mice were already smaller at birth (Fig. 3A, left panel) and remained smaller throughout the investigated lifetime (up to 1 year). Comparison of body weights of males (Fig. 3E) and females (Fig. 3F) at three different time points (25, 60, and 90 days) revealed statistically significant body weight differences between wild-type and knock-out mice (n ≥ 10 for each time point, *, males p < 0.01; *, females p < 0.05). Growth differences between male wild-type and knock-out mice were more pronounced than that of their female counterparts. This might be because of an X-chromosomal compensatory effect in females, which is not known yet and has to be investigated further. Organ weights in relation to whole body weights were compared at different time points: the organ weight to body weight ratio was not altered in knock-out mice (lung:WT = 0.6% ± 0.137%, knock-out = 0.8% ± 0.081%, heart:WT = 0.4% ± 0.119%, knock-out = 0.5% ± 0.076%, kidney (average of both kidneys):WT = 0.4% ± 0.095%, knock-out = 0.6% ± 0.099%; liver:WT = 4,6% ± 0.436%, knock-out = 5,0% ± 0.707%; spleen:WT = 0.3% ± 0.091%, knock-out = 0.3% ± 0.117%; n(WT) = 10, n(knock-out) = 7), pointing toward a proportional dwarfism phenotype. Unaltered Hormone and Blood Tests in Spred-2-deficient Mice—To determine whether the dwarf phenotype might be because of changed levels of steroid or thyroid hormones, we compared serum levels of testosterone, estrogen, thyroid stimulating hormone, 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine, and thyroxin in female and male knock-out and wild-type mice. None of these investigated hormone levels was found to be altered and, therefore, altered hormone production and secretion of steroid and thyroid hormones could be excluded (data not shown). As dwarfism could also be because of changed insulin metabolism, we tested the blood glucose levels of Spred-2+/+ and Spred-2-/- mice at different times of the day. Because no significant alterations in glucose levels were detectable, a dysfunction of insulin metabolism seemed very unlikely (data not shown). To observe whether the lack of a functional Spred-2 protein causes structural changes in organs of these mice, we stained paraffin sections of several organs with hematoxylin and eosin. Apart from a clear increase in number of megakaryocytes in the spleen of Spred-2 knock-out mice as compared with wild-type littermates, we did not observe obvious structural changes in lung, heart, liver, kidney, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, thymus, testis, ovaries, uterus, skeletal muscle, salivary glands and the prostate (data not shown). Spred-2 Promoter Activity in Bones—Assuming that the dwarf phenotype was because of a skeletal disorder, we determined whether Spred-2 was expressed in bones and chondroc"
https://openalex.org/W2079486904,"Polyprotein processing is a major strategy used by many plant and animal viruses to maximize the number of protein products obtainable from a single open reading frame. In Sesbania mosaic virus, open reading frame-2 codes for a polyprotein that is cleaved into different functional proteins in cis by the N-terminal serine protease domain. The soluble protease domain lacking 70-amino-acid residues from the N terminus (ΔN70Pro, where Pro is protease) was not active in trans. Interestingly, the protease domain exhibited trans-catalytic activity when VPg (viral protein genome-linked) was present at the C terminus. Bioinformatic analysis of VPg primary structure suggested that it could be a disordered protein. Biophysical studies validated this observation, and VPg resembled “natively unfolded” proteins. CD spectral analysis showed that the ΔN70Pro-VPg fusion protein had a characteristic secondary structure with a 230 nm positive CD peak. Mutation of Trp-43 in the VPg domain to phenylalanine abrogated the positive peak with concomitant loss in cis- and trans-proteolytic activity of the ΔN70Pro domain. Further, deletion of VPg domain from the polyprotein completely abolished proteolytic processing. The results suggested a novel mechanism of activation of the protease, wherein the interaction between the natively unfolded VPg and the protease domains via aromatic amino acid residues alters the conformation of the individual domains and the active site of the protease. Thus, VPg is an activator of protease in Sesbania mosaic virus, and probably by this mechanism, the polyprotein processing could be regulated in planta.

Sesbania mosaic virus (SeMV) 1The abbreviations used are: SeMV, Sesbania mosaic virus; VPg, viral protein genome-linked; Pro, protease; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; RdRP, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; IF, initiation factor. 1The abbreviations used are: SeMV, Sesbania mosaic virus; VPg, viral protein genome-linked; Pro, protease; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; RdRP, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; IF, initiation factor. belongs to the genus Sobemovirus, which infects Sesbania grandiflora (1Lokesh G.L. Gopinath K. Satheshkumar P.S. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is an icosahedral virus with T = 3 symmetry, and the capsid is made up of 180 coat protein subunits of molecular mass 29 kDa (2Bhuvaneshwari M. Subramanya H.S. Gopinath K. Savithri H.S. Nayudu M.V. Murthy M.R. Structure. 1995; 3: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is a positive sense RNA virus of genome size 4149 nucleotides having four overlapping open reading frames (1Lokesh G.L. Gopinath K. Satheshkumar P.S. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Open reading frame-2 encodes a polyprotein consisting of N-terminal serine protease (Pro), viral protein genome-linked (VPg), a 10-kDa protein, and C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) domains (3Satheshkumar P.S. Lokesh G.L. Savithri H.S. Virology. 2004; 318: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The Pro domain is responsible for the proteolytic maturation of the polyprotein and cleaves between E-T and E-S amino acid residues. The active site and cleavage site residues have been mapped and confirmed by mutational analysis (3Satheshkumar P.S. Lokesh G.L. Savithri H.S. Virology. 2004; 318: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The protease domain was able to carry out cis-cleavage between Pro-VPg precursor, albeit at a slower rate. The cis-proteolytic activity considerably increased when the N-terminal 70-amino-acid residues predicted to form a transmembrane domain were deleted. Further, it was demonstrated that the cleavage site mutant E325A of ΔN70Pro-VPg was active in trans (3Satheshkumar P.S. Lokesh G.L. Savithri H.S. Virology. 2004; 318: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the protease alone was unable to perform the trans-cleavage function. It has been observed earlier that in some viruses, VPg influences the activity of the protease. For instance, in Tomato ringspot nepovirus (TomRSV), VPg-Pro precursor was shown to be more active in cleavage at one of the sites (4Wang A. Carrier K. Chisholm J. Wieczorek A. Huguenot C. Sanfacon H. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In cowpea mosaic virus, expression of the protease along with the N-terminal extension corresponding to the VPg sequence enhanced its proteolytic activity (5Dessens J.T. Lomonossoff G.P. Virology. 1992; 189: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which VPg activates the proteolytic activity is not known.VPg is usually a small protein or peptide, which serves as the protein primer for RNA synthesis in many animal and plant viruses. In polioviruses, the VPg is 22 amino acid residues long (6Molla A. Harris K.S. Paul A.V. Shin S.H. Mugavero J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27015-27020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in cowpea mosaic virus, it consists of 28 amino acids (5Dessens J.T. Lomonossoff G.P. Virology. 1992; 189: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). NMR studies on cowpea mosaic virus VPg suggested that it does not have any ordered structure (7van de Ven F.J. Lycksell P.O. van Kammen A. Hilbers C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In Sobemoviruses, the size of VPg varies between 9 and 12 kDa (8Tamm T. Truve E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6231-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and it is 9 kDa in SeMV, consisting of 77 amino acid residues (1Lokesh G.L. Gopinath K. Satheshkumar P.S. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The presence of VPg linked to the 5′ end of the genomic RNA has been confirmed by determining the N-terminal amino acid sequence of VPg in Southern bean mosaic virus, Cocksfoot mottle virus, and SeMV genomic RNA (1Lokesh G.L. Gopinath K. Satheshkumar P.S. Savithri H.S. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9van der Wilk F. Verbeek M. Dullemans A. van den Heuvel J. Virus Genes. 1998; 17: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Makinen K. Makelainen K. Arshava N. Tamm T. Merits A. Truve E. Zavriev S. Saarma M. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2783-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, no further studies have been reported on the characterization of VPg in Sobemoviruses.“Natively unfolded” proteins are a unique class of proteins that exhibit their function in the absence of ordered structure. These proteins are believed to adopt a rigid conformation stabilized in vivo upon interaction with natural substrates (11Uversky V.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 12Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). We wanted to examine whether the recombinant SeMV VPg exists in a natively unfolded state and whether its presence regulates the protease activity.In this study, we report that the purified recombinant SeMV VPg is a natively unfolded protein lacking both secondary and tertiary structures. However, when present at the C terminus of the protease domain (ΔN70Pro-VPg), VPg modulates both cis- and trans-catalytic activities of the protease by inducing a conformational change in the individual domains. Trp-43 of VPg was identified to be crucial for these interactions. Deletion of the VPg domain from the polyprotein resulted in the complete inhibition of proteolytic processing although the protease domain was intact. The results presented suggested that the natively unfolded VPg regulates the proteolytic maturation of the polyprotein in sobemoviruses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—ΔN70Pro, ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A, ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A, ΔN70Pro-VPg-W43F, ΔN70Pro-VPg-P10-RdRP, ΔN70Pro-VPg-P10-RdRP-W43F, and ΔN70Pro-P10-RdRP genes were cloned in pRSET A vector (Invitrogen) at NheI and BamHI sites. The cloning strategy results in the addition of 13 amino acids from the vector in the N terminus, including the His6 residues for affinity purification. All the recombinant clones were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 pLysS cells and induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 5 h. After induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (buffer A). The His-tagged proteins were purified using Ni-NTA chromatography (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Since the expression of His-tagged VPg was less, it was purified from ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A by cleaving it with ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A. As the His tag is present in the N terminus of the protease, cleaved ΔN70Pro and uncleaved ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A will bind to the Ni-NTA column, whereas free VPg is obtained in unbound fraction. The purity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE.Protease Cleavage Assays—trans-Cleavage reaction was performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0 buffer. 100 μg of ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A (substrate) was incubated with the enzyme (ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A) in the molar ratio of 1:10 at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS loading dye followed by boiling. The reaction products were separated in 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Since the ΔN70Pro was not active in 1:10 dilution, cleavage was carried out with higher concentration (1:3 dilution), and thus, the added protease can be observed in the gel. For determining the cis-catalytic activity of the protease, the respective clones were expressed in BL21 DE3 pLysS cells and induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and then cells were harvested, sonicated in buffer A, and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE.Deletion and Site-directed Mutagenesis—N- and C-terminal truncations were carried out by using PCR with the appropriate primers (Table I) and cloned in pRSET A vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a PCR-based sense and antisense primer approach (13Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) with mutant oligonucleotide primers (Table I). Deletion of VPg domain from the polyprotein was carried out by a PCR-based approach. Antisense primer (VPgΔBglII-a) corresponding to the protease C terminus and sense primer (VPgΔBglII-s) corresponding to that of the N terminus of P10 domain were designed with BglII sites. PCR was carried out with ΔN70Pro sense/VPgΔBglII-a (product 1) and RdRP antisense/VPgΔBglII-s (product 2) primers using ΔN70Pro-VPg-P10-RdRP-containing clone. The PCR products were eluted from the gel and digested with BglII restriction enzyme. The digested PCR products were ligated using T4 DNA ligase at 16 °C for 8 h. The ligated product was subjected to PCR amplification with ΔN70Pro sense/RdRP antisense primers. Therefore, only when products 1 and 2 are ligated would amplification occur with this set of primers. The final PCR product thus obtained lacked the internal VPg domain and was recloned again in pRSET A vector at NheI and BamHI sites to obtain the clone ΔN70Pro-P10-RdRP.Table IList of oligonucleotides used for cloning and mutagenesisNameSequence 5′–3′DescriptionΔN70Pro-sCTAGCTAGCCATATGGAGGCAAAGCAGGACSense and antisense primers used for amplification of protease lacking 70 amino acid residues from the N terminus.

The ellipticity was monitored from 190 to 250 nm using 0.5 mg/ml protein in a 0.2-cm path length cuvette with a bandwidth of 1 nm and response time of 1 s. The molar ellipticity was calculated from the software by using the molar concentration of protein. The CD spectra of denatured proteins were recorded after incubating the protein with different concentrations of urea for 5 h at 25 °C. All the spectra were corrected with the respective buffer controls.Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The fluorescence experiments were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS5S luminescence spectrometer. The intrinsic fluorescence spectrum was monitored from 300 to 400 nm upon excitation at 280 nm in a 1-cm path length cuvette. 0.2-0.4 mg/ml of proteins was used in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. The stability of ΔN70Pro, VPg, and ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A was studied by incubating 0.2 mg/ml protein with 8 m urea for 5 h at 25 °C.Gel Filtration Analysis—-The oligomeric status of ΔN70Pro, VPg, ΔN70Pro-VPg E325A, and ΔN70Pro-VPg E325A-W43F was analyzed using a Superdex 200 analytical gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) precalibrated with standards of known molecular mass (native SeMV, which elutes in void volume, tyroglobulin 669 kDa; apoferitin, 443 kDa; β-amylase, 200 kDa; alcohol dehydrogenase, 150 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; cytochrome c, 12 kDa; aprotinin, 6.5 kDa). From the elution volume, the Rf value was calculated, and the molecular weights of the proteins were estimated from the standard graph.RESULTStrans-Catalytic Activity of ΔN70Pro and ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A—The trans-catalytic activity was performed with purified ΔN70Pro using ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A (an active site mutant, in which protease is inactive due to mutation of active site residue Ser-284 to Ala but cleavage site E-T is retained) as substrate. Under the reaction conditions, ΔN70Pro did not cleave the substrate ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A, suggesting that it was not active in trans (Fig. 1, lane 3; the 25-kDa band seen in lanes 3 and 4 is due to the added ΔN70Pro). However, ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A fusion protein (cleavage site mutant in which the catalytic triad residues are intact and the cis-cleavage is abolished by the mutation of cleavage site residue Glu-325 to Ala) was able to cleave ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A substrate in trans, resulting in the generation of two domains, ΔN70Pro and VPg (Fig. 1, lane 5). To rule out the possibility that the expression of ΔN70Pro alone rendered it inactive, cis-active ΔN70Pro was purified from ΔN70Pro-VPg precursor. Expression of ΔN70Pro-VPg in E. coli results in complete cleavage between protease and VPg. Since the His tag was present at the N terminus, the cleaved protease was purified using Ni-NTA chromatography. Even this cis-active ΔN70Pro was not able to cleave the substrate (Fig. 1, lane 4). To check whether VPg could act in trans, cleavage reaction was performed with ΔN70Pro in the presence of VPg. However, the addition of VPg did not enhance protease activity in trans (Fig. 1, compare lanes 7 and 8; the 25- and 9-kDa bands in lane 8 are due to the added ΔN70Pro and VPg), suggesting that only when VPg was present as a C-terminal fusion did the protease exhibit trans-cleavage activity. The additional bands (shown as *) in lanes 4 and 7 are due to another suboptimal cleavage between Ala-134-Val-135. 2P. S. Satheshkumar, P. Gayathri, K. Prasad, and H. S. Savithri, unpublished observation. A schematic representation of the results of trans-cleavage assay is presented in Fig. 1B. To understand the nature of VPg-mediated interactions in the activation of protease domain, bioinformatic and biophysical analyses of VPg were performed.Bioinformatic Analysis of Protease and VPg—The protein folding predictions were carried out using two different software programs. The software PONDR®, Predictors of Natural Disordered Regions, is available through a branch of Molecular Kinetics Inc. (14Dunker A.K. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Iakoucheva L.M. Obradovic Z. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6573-6582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). The unstructured region prediction analysis was performed using default set parameters for ΔN70Pro, VPg, and protease-VPg fusion protein amino acid sequences. The result obtained showed that protease and protease-VPg (Fig. 2, A and C) fall in the category of ordered proteins, whereas VPg (Fig. 2B) was grouped with disordered proteins.Fig. 2Protein folding predictions analysis suggest the unfolded nature of VPg. The protein folding predictions were performed using the software PONDR, Predictors of Natural Disordered Regions. The amino acid sequences of ΔN70Pro and VPg were subjected to analysis using the default values. The outputs of prediction analysis are presented.

The program is based on the algorithm proposed by Uversky et al. (15Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). In this method, based on the mean net charge and hydrophobicity, a folding index is derived for the folded/unfolded state of the protein. The FoldIndex© analysis of ΔN70Pro, VPg, and ΔN70Pro-VPg amino acid sequence was performed using default values. The results indicate that the entire sequence of protease occurs in the folded state (Fig. 3A). The results corresponding to VPg clearly showed that it is unlikely to be a folded protein as most of its residues belonged to the unfolded region (Fig. 3B). When the ΔN70Pro-VPg sequence was analyzed, only the VPg domain showed a disordered region similar to that of VPg (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that VPg might exist in a natively unfolded conformation. To confirm this prediction, we have carried out secondary and tertiary structural studies on recombinant VPg in the absence/presence of ΔN70Pro.Fig. 3Protein folding predictions analysis suggest the unfolded nature of VPg. The primary amino acid sequences of ΔN70Pro and VPg were analyzed using the software FoldIndex. The results of the predictions for ΔN70Pro, VPg, and ΔN70Pro-VPg are shown in A, B, and C, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CD Spectral Analysis—Far-UV CD spectrum provides information on the folded nature of the proteins. The CD spectrum of purified ΔN70Pro showed a minimum at 216 nm, indicating that the protein is folded with a high content of β-sheet conformation (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the VPg CD spectrum revealed maximum negative ellipticity at 200 nm with negligible ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 4B), a feature characteristic of random coil structures (16Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Rydberg E.H. Solomon A. Toker L. Auld V.J. Silman I. Botti S. Sussman J.L. Proteins. 2003; 53: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), consistent with the folding predictions for VPg. Interestingly, the far-UV CD spectrum of ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A showed a positive peak at 230 nm and a negative peak at 210 nm (Fig. 4C). The intensity of the positive peak was very significant, and it was not present in either the protease or the VPg CD spectrum. The presence of a 230 nm peak only in the fusion protein suggested a conformational change in the fusion protein. Further, treatment of ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A with 2 m urea resulted in almost 50% reduction in the 230 nm peak, and incubation with 3 and 4 m urea completely eliminated the 230 nm positive peak (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4CD spectral analysis shows unfolded nature of VPg and 230 nm positive peak in ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A fusion protein. The CD spectra were recorded using 0.5 mg/ml of purified proteins from 190 to 250 nm. The CD spectra of ΔN70Pro, VPg, and ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A are shown in A, B, and C, respectively. D, the CD spectra of denatured ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A were recorded upon treatment with 1-4 m urea.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fluorescence Spectroscopic Analysis—Fluorescence spectrum of ΔN70Pro showed maximum emission at 340 nm upon excitation at 280 nm, typical of a folded protein. The emission maximum showed a red shift to 359 nm upon the addition of 8 m urea due to the exposure of the aromatic residues to the solvent (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the fluorescence spectrum of VPg showed a maximum emission at 357 nm even in the native state. The emission maximum remained the same upon the addition of 8 m urea, indicating that VPg lacks tertiary structure (Fig. 5B). The fusion protein (ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A) behaved like ΔN70Pro, with maximum emission at 342 nm, which upon denaturation increased to 356 nm (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5Fluorescence spectrum of VPg demonstrates absence of tertiary structure under native condition. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm after exciting the protein at 280 nm under native and denatured conditions. The protein was denatured by treatment with 8 m urea. A, B, and C correspond to ΔN70Pro, VPg, and ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A fusion proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtration analysis was carried out using an analytical column, Superdex S200. ΔN70Pro eluted as a single peak with the expected molecular mass of 25 kDa of the monomer (Fig. 6A). As expected, VPg did not elute at a position corresponding to its size of 9 kDa. It gave a peak corresponding to the size of 120 kDa, further confirming its open and random conformation (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A gave three peaks, a major peak corresponding to the size of 400 kDa (peak 2), two minor peaks corresponding to 130 kDa (peak 3), and that in the void volume (peak 1) (Fig. 6C). The gel filtration analysis suggests a change in the oligomeric status of the protease when present in fusion with VPg. The protease activities of different oligomeric fractions were checked by trans-catalytic assay with ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A with equal concentrations of ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A from each peak fraction. ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A eluted in peaks 2 and 3 retained protease activity, whereas the higher aggregate eluted in void volume (peak 1) was not active (Fig. 6D). However, the nature of the oligomeric states was difficult to assess because of the abnormal behavior of VPg.Fig. 6ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A exists in multiple aggregation states.

The positions corresponding to the different protein bands are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutational Analysis of VPg—Comparison of the VPg amino acid sequence between Sobemo- and Poleroviruses revealed a conserved W(A/G)D motif followed by a stretch of acidic amino acid residues (10Makinen K.

In addition to this conserved motif, the amino acid sequence of VPg in SeMV, Southern cowpea mosaic virus, and Southern bean mosaic virus-Ark contains a proline-rich sequence toward the C terminus. Since polyprolineII-like helix gives a positive CD peak at 230 nm (17Parrot I. Huang P.C. Khosla C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45572-45578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we have examined whether proline-rich and acidic domains can form the polyproline II helix. Mutational analysis of VPg was carried out by the deletion of 18 (removal of a proline-rich sequence) and 25 (removal of a acidic and proline-rich stretch) residues from the C terminus (Fig. 7A). The CD spectral analysis of these truncated proteins (ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A-CΔ18 and ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A-CΔ25) also showed a 230 nm positive peak, ruling out the potential involvement of the C-terminal 25 residues in contributing to the positive CD band at 230 nm (Fig. 7B). Further, the results suggested that poly-proline like helix is not responsible for the positive CD at 230 nm in this case. Therefore, the role of aromatic residues in VPg was examined.Fig. 7Identification of amino acid residue in VPg responsible for 230 nm positive peak in CD spectrum. A, the positions of amino acid residues Trp and Tyr and the sites of C-terminal deletions carried out in VPg are indicated. The CD spectral profiles of ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A-CΔ18 and ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A-CΔ25 are depicted in B; ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A-CΔ28 is depicted in C; site-directed mutant ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A-Y21F is detected in D; and ΔN70Pro-VPg-E325A-W43F is depicted in E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Trp-43 of VPg Contributes for Positive CD Band—The positive CD peak at 230 nm has been attributed to the contribution from aromatic amino acid residues, mainly tyrosine and tryptophan (18Woody R.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). VPg has two tyrosine and three tryptophan residues in its amino acid sequence (Fig. 7A). Deletion of 25 amino acids from the VPg C terminus resulted in removal of one of the tryptophan residues (Trp-72), ruling out its role in the positive CD band at 230 nm. Another tryptophan residue is present in the WAD motif Trp-51, which is preceded by Tyr-50. To check whether these residues contribute for the 230 nm peak, C-terminal deletion was carried out using a unique ScaI restriction enzyme site present in the VPg sequence. Restriction digestion of the PCR product of ΔN70Pro-VPg with ScaI enzyme followed by cloning of this PCR product resulted in the removal of 28 residues from the C terminus of VPg (Fig. 7A). CD profile of this mutant ΔN70Pro-VPg-S284A-CΔ28 also showed the 230 nm peak (Fig. 7C), sugg"

In rod cells of the vertebrate retina, phosphorylation of rhodopsin is mediated by GRK1. In cone cells, either GRK1, GRK7, or both, depending on the species, are speculated to initiate signal termination by phosphorylating the cone opsins. To compare the biochemical properties of GRK1 and GRK7, we measured the Km and Vmax of these kinases for ATP and rhodopsin, a model substrate. The results demonstrated that these kinases share similar kinetic properties. We also determined that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylates GRK1 at Ser21 and GRK7 at Ser23 and Ser36 in vitro. These sites are also phosphorylated when FLAG-tagged GRK1 and GRK7 are expressed in HEK-293 cells treated with forskolin to stimulate the endogenous production of cAMP and activation of PKA. Rod outer segments isolated from bovine retina phosphorylated the FLAG-tagged GRKs in the presence of dibutyryl-cAMP, suggesting that GRK1 and GRK7 are physiologically relevant substrates. Although both GRKs also contain putative phosphorylation sites for PKC and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, neither kinase phosphorylated GRK1 or GRK7. Phosphorylation of GRK1 and GRK7 by PKA reduces the ability of GRK1 and GRK7 to phosphorylate rhodopsin in vitro. Since exposure to light causes a decrease in cAMP levels in rod cells, we propose that phosphorylation of GRK1 and GRK7 by PKA occurs in the dark, when cAMP levels in photoreceptor cells are elevated, and represents a novel mechanism for regulating the activities of these kinases.

They mediate cellular responses to a variety of environment stimuli, including light, taste, odorants, ions, nucleotides, peptides, and lipids, through the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (1.Bockaert J.

Phosphorylation of ligand-activated GPCRs by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) is the initial step in the rapid termination or desensitization of GPCR signal transduction. For example, in rod cells of the vertebrate retina, desensitization occurs when light-activated rhodopsin is phosphorylated by GRK1, followed by the binding of visual arrestin to the phosphorylated rhodopsin, which blocks its interaction with transducin, the rod cell G protein (5.Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Palczewski K. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2003; 22: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although desensitization also occurs in cone cells, less is known about the proteins involved and their regulation. GRK1 and a cone-specific GRK, GRK7, are coexpressed in human and monkey cone cells (6.Weiss E.R. Raman D. Shirakawa S. Ducceschi M.H. Bertram P.T. Wong F. Kraft T.W. Osawa S. Mol.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9175-9184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Chen C.K. Zhang K. Church-Kopish J. Huang W. Zhang H. Chen Y.J. Frederick J.M. Baehr W. Mol.

Sci. 2003; 44: 1268-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, only GRK7 is expressed in the cones of pigs and dogs. However, it is absent from the mouse genome altogether and mouse cones express only GRK1 (7.Weiss E.R. Ducceschi M.H. Horner T.J. Li A. Craft C.M. Osawa S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9175-9184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, differences in cone visual transduction between species may result in part from variations in the expression pattern of GRK1 and GRK7. We recently implicated GRK7 in the phosphorylation of cone opsins in retinas from the pig and the 13-lined ground squirrel, rod-dominant and cone-dominant mammals, respectively (10.Liu P. Osawa S. Weiss E.R. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the role of GRK7 in cones might be similar to the role of GRK1 in rods. Very little is known regarding the regulation of GRKs in the retina apart from the interaction of GRK1 with recoverin, a retina-specific Ca2+ sensor protein that inhibits the binding of GRK1 to rhodopsin (11.Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Since both GRK1 and GRK7 may phosphorylate cone opsins in primates, a comparison of their enzyme activities and their regulation by other signaling molecules is essential for understanding their potential contributions to cone opsin deactivation. In this report, we compare the activities of human GRK1 and GRK7 in vitro. GRK1 and GRK7 share a similar Km and Vmax for bovine rhodopsin, a model GPCR substrate. We also determined that PKA phosphorylates the amino termini of GRK1 and GRK7, resulting in reduced ability of these two kinases to phosphorylate rhodopsin in vitro. Because cAMP levels are regulated by light in photoreceptor cells (12.Salceda R. van Roosmalen G.R. Jansen P.A. Bonting S.L. Daemen F.J.

Expression and Purification of Human FLAG-GRK1 and FLAG-GRK7—The FLAG amino acid sequence (Sigma), DYKDDDDK, was placed at the amino terminus of GRK1 and GRK7 by PCR amplification. Point mutations in GRK1 and GRK7 were generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis using the QuikChange® multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequence analysis. HEK-293 cells were transfected using the diethylaminoethyl dextran method as described previously (20.Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After 72 h in medium supplemented with 1 mm mevalonolactone (Sigma), the cells were lysed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.5% n-dodecyl maltoside, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin followed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C and washed six times by centrifugation with TBS. The GRKs were eluted with FLAG peptide according to directions from the manufacturer. The eluted FLAG-GRKs were separated by SDS-PAGE (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) and stained with SYPRO Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The purified GRKs were visualized with a STORM imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations and purity were determined using a concentration curve of bovine serum albumin as a standard. The GRKs were stored at 4 °C or at –20 °C in 50% glycerol. Experiments were performed within 2–3 weeks using batches of GRKs isolated at the same time to prevent errors due to different storage times. Isolation of Urea-stripped Rod Outer Segment (UROS) Membranes from Bovine Retina—Procedures were performed under dim red light (Kodak No. 2 Safelight). Frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas (J. A.

The supernatant was diluted with 2 volumes of Buffer A and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-14 rotor. After resuspending the membrane pellet in Buffer A, the membranes were layered over a sucrose gradient (25–30%, v/v in Buffer A) and centrifuged at 27,000 rpm for 30 min using a Beckman SW 28 rotor. The membranes collected from the interface were washed three times by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti70 rotor for 30 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA, followed by three washes in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. The membranes were homogenized in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 m urea, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After 5-fold dilution in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT, the membranes were centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti70 rotor and washed four times in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT. The membranes were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT and stored at –80 °C. To determine the concentration of rhodopsin, UROS membranes were solubilized in 2% CHAPS in the dark with 20 mm hydroxylamine and the absorption spectrum measured before and after bleaching under bright fluorescent light for 10 min as described (20.Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After subtracting the rhodopsin spectrum (normalized at 700 nm) measured in the light from the spectrum measured in the dark, the concentration of rhodopsin was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 42,700 m–1 cm–1 at 498 nm (22.Hong K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4517-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of Bovine Rhodopsin—UROS membranes containing bovine rhodopsin were used as a substrate for phosphorylation by FLAG-tagged GRK1 and GRK7. Rhodopsin phosphorylation was measured by incubating UROS membranes in 25 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 6 mm MgCl2, and [γ-32P]ATP concentrations as indicated in the legends to Figs. 1, 2, 10, and 11 in the presence or absence of light at 30 °C. Assays were performed in triplicate and 10-μl aliquots of each reaction were spotted onto P81 Whatman® phosphocellulose discs (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK), dried, and washed three times in 50 mm phosphoric acid and once in acetone. Phosphorylation of rhodopsin was quantified by the Ceren-kov method. Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad PRISM, San Diego, CA) after subtracting the level of phosphorylation measured in the dark from the level of phosphorylation in the light. For determination of the Km and Vmax for ATP, 50 nm GRK1 or GRK7 was incubated for 2 min with 10 μm rhodopsin and 10–400 μm ATP. The ATP concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. For determination of the Km and Vmax for rhodopsin, 50 nm GRK1 or GRK7 was incubated for 2 min with 300 μm [γ-32P]ATP (500–1000 cpm/pmol) and 0.2–12.5 μm rhodopsin. The phosphorylation of rhodopsin was linear during this time period, as demonstrated in Fig. 1C. In some experiments, phosphorylation of rhodopsin by GRK1 and GRK7 was measured after phosphorylation of the GRKs by the catalytic subunit of PKA (100 units/μl reaction mixture, New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). GRKs (50 nm) were incubated with or without PKA catalytic subunit for 10 min at 30 °C. Rhodopsin (2 μm) was added for an additional 2 min, and the reactions were stopped by spotting aliquots onto P81 Whatman® phosphocellulose discs. Phosphorylation was monitored by the Cerenkov method.Fig. 2Kinetic parameters of human GRK1 and GRK7.

Phosphorylation of rhodopsin in the dark was subtracted from phosphorylation in the light and normalized to the levels of rhodopsin phosphorylation by wild-type GRK1 preincubated in the absence of ATP or PKA (–ATP/–PKA). The values for phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant GRK1 in the dark were ∼101 ± 24 nmol/min/mg of kinase. In contrast, the values in the light range from 194 ± 29 to 548 ± 75.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE or spotted onto P81 Whatman® phosphocellulose discs, washed as described above, and quantified using the Cerenkov method to determine the amount of phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by PKCα (Invitrogen) was assessed using a mixture of phosphatidylserine (Sigma) and diacylglycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) as described by the manufacturer. Histone (H1) Type III (Sigma) was used as a control substrate to monitor PKCα activity. Phosphorylation of GRK1 and GRK7 by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (Calbiochem) was measured in the presence of calmodulin (Calbiochem). Syntide 2 (Sigma) was used as a control substrate to monitor CaMKII activity.Fig. 7Phosphorylation of wild-type (WT) and mutant GRK7.

Wild-type and mutant GRKs were incubated with 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/reaction) in the presence (+) or absence (–) of PKA for 1 h at 30 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimage analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In Situ Phosphorylation of GRK1 and GRK7—Phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant GRK1 and GRK7 was assessed after transient expression of the proteins in HEK-293 cells using the Lipofectamine Plus transfection method (Invitrogen). Three days after transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-free DMEM and preincubated with phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.1% serum for 30 min. Cells were washed in phosphate-free DMEM and preincubated with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free DMEM for 1 h. Cells were incubated with 25 μm forskolin (Sigma) in Me2SO or Me2SO only for 15 min, then lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The lysates were centrifuged at 40,000 × g and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin for 4 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed five times with TBS and incubated with Laemmli buffer before separation by SDS-PAGE (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was visualized by phosphorimage analysis using a STORM imaging system. The expression levels of the GRKs were compared by Western blot analysis using the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and the Western-Star™ protein detection kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for chemiluminescence detection. Phosphorylation of FLAG-tagged GRKs by PKA from Rod Outer Segments—ROS were isolated from frozen dark-adapted bovine retina (J. A. Lawson, Inc.) using a stepwise sucrose density gradient as described (23.Bigay J. Chabre M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24.Cabrera J.L. de Freitas F. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of FLAG-tagged GRK1 and GRK7 was performed under dim red light using methods described previously (25.Balasubramanian N. Levay K. Keren-Raifman T. Faurobert E. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12619-12627Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. ROS containing 20 μm rhodopsin were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100. FLAG-tagged GRK or GRK7 (1 μg) and 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP (30 μCi) were added to the ROS and incubated in the presence or absence of 200 μm dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) and 10 μm H-89 (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 10 mm NaF. After centrifugation of the ROS lysates for 15 min at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA45 rotor, the supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with lysis buffer, incubated with Laemmli buffer, and the extracted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and phosphorylation was observed by phosphorimage analysis. Western blot analysis was performed with the same nitrocellulose membrane using the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and a chemiluminescent detection system as described above. Chemical Cleavage of GRK1—FLAG-tagged GRK1 (10 μg) was incubated with or without PKA catalytic subunit and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/reaction) for 30 min at 30 °C. Chemical digestion of GRK1 with 70% formic acid was performed at 37 °C for 48 h while shaking. Cleavage of GRK1 with iodosobenzoic acid was performed after heating GRK1 at 70 °C for 10 min with 0.1% SDS (final concentration). The heated samples were diluted with water (1:1, v/v) prior to the addition of iodosobenzoic acid (2 mg/ml in acetic acid, final concentration). The cleavage reaction was incubated under N2 in the dark for 48 h at room temperature. After chemical digestion with formic acid or iodosobenzoic acid, the reaction mixtures were subjected to five wash cycles with water by SpeedVac lyophilization, resuspended in 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and analyzed using a 4–12% NuPAGE gel system. Two-dimensional Chromatography of GRK1 and GRK7—Peptide maps were generated using proteins radiolabeled in vitro or in situ as described by Boyle et al. (26.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) and Schaller and Parsons (27.Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). For in vitro experiments, 1–2 μg of GRK1 or GRK7 were incubated with PKA catalytic subunit (100 units/μl reaction mixture, New England Biolabs Inc.) and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/reaction) at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The radioactive bands were excised and incubated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 100 mm acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with distilled water, the nitrocellulose was incubated with either 20 μg trypsin (GRK1) or chymotrypsin (GRK7) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 16 h at 37 °C. Following proteolysis, the reaction mixture was lyophilized and washed with distilled water by centrifugation in a SpeedVac. The GRK1 peptides were separated by thin layer electrophoresis (TLE) for 9–12 min at 1000 V in 0.126 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.9, using a Hunter thin layer peptide mapping system (CBS Scientific, Del Mar, CA). The GRK7 peptides were separated by TLE in pH 1.9 buffer (88% formic acid:acetic acid: H2O, 25:78:897, v/v/v). The plates were dried and subjected to ascending TLC in chromatography buffer (butanol:acetic acid:pyridine:H2O:isobutyric acid, 2:3:5:29:65, v/v/v/v/v). The chromatography plates were dried and exposed to x-ray film to visualize the phosphopeptides. Comparison of the Kinetic Parameters of GRK1 and GRK7—A comparison of the enzymatic activities of GRK1 and GRK7 may help distinguish their potential roles in cone opsin desensitization. FLAG-tagged human GRK1 and GRK7 were purified from transiently transfected HEK-293 cells using affinity chromatography. One contaminating band is visible at ∼67 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1A). The positions of the FLAG-tagged GRKs were confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the same sample using an anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). GRK1 exhibited a slightly higher mobility than GRK7, although its predicted molecular size is slightly larger (64.8 kDa for FLAG-GRK1 and 63.5 kDa for FLAG-GRK7). Both kinases were composed of 2–3 bands, possibly due to heterogeneous isoprenylation or phosphorylation. The expressed proteins were ∼70–80% pure (Fig. 1B). To measure the activities of these kinases in vitro, UROS membranes containing bovine rhodopsin were used as a model substrate. Rhodopsin was selected as a substrate because of its ease of isolation in large quantities from bovine retina. In contrast, the cone opsins cannot be isolated in sufficient amounts for these studies. The cone opsins possess serine/threonine-rich carboxyl termini that serve as substrates for phosphorylation (28.Kefalov V. Fu Y. Marsh-Armstrong N. Yau K.W. Nature. 2003; 425: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29.Kennedy M.J. Dunn F.A. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2004; 41: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similarly, rhodopsin possesses seven serines and threonines in the carboxyl terminus that serve as substrates for GRK1 (5.Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Palczewski K. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2003; 22: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To define the appropriate conditions for analyzing the activities of these kinases, a time course of rhodopsin phosphorylation by GRK1 and GRK7 was performed (Fig. 1C). The results demonstrated that phosphorylation reaches a plateau in ∼60 min and the reaction is linear for at least 2 min (Fig. 1C, inset). Phosphorylation of rhodopsin in the dark by either GRK1 or GRK7 was negligible over the 60-min time period (data not shown). Therefore, a 2-min assay was used for all subsequent experiments. The kinetic parameters of GRK1 and GRK7 were determined in vitro for ATP (Fig. 2A) and rhodopsin (Fig. 2B) and are summarized in Table I. GRK7 has a Km for ATP (21.4 μm) that is twice that of GRK1 (10.6 μm). The Km values for rhodopsin were 1.9 μm and 3.5 μm for GRK7 and GRK1, respectively. GRK7 and GRK1 also display similar catalytic activities and phosphorylate rhodopsin with a Vmax of 916 and 1132 nmol/min/mg kinase, respectively. The Km values for ATP and rhodopsin reported here are similar to those reported by Palczewski and colleagues using bovine GRK1 to phosphorylate bovine rhodopsin in membranes (30.Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2306-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31.Palczewski K. Ohguro H. Premont R.T. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15294-15298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The affinity of GRK1 for detergent-solubilized rhodopsin reported by Thurmond et al. (32.Thurmond R.L. Creuzenet C. Reeves P.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1715-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is 10-fold higher (0.45 μm) than the affinity of GRK1 for rhodopsin measured in our experiments. Their studies also reported a lower Vmax for detergent-extracted rhodopsin. Althoug"

Here we show that cell surface expression of the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 is compromised in mouse cells from which the Bap31 gene has been deleted. CD9 and CD81 facilitate the function of multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane, including integrins. Of note, BAP31 does not appear to influence the egress of α5β1 or αvβ3 integrins to the cell surface, but in Bap31-null mouse cells, these integrins are not able to maintain cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix in the presence of reduced serum. Consequently, Bap31-null cells are sensitive to serum starvation-induced apoptosis. Reconstitution of wild-type BAP31 into these Bap31-null cells restores integrin-mediated cell attachment and cell survival after serum stress, whereas interference with the functions of CD9, α5β1, or αvβ3 by antagonizing antibodies makes BAP31 cells act similar to Bap31-null cells in these respects. Finally, in human KB epithelial cells protected from apoptosis by BCL-2, the caspase-8 cleavage product, p20 BAP31, inhibits egress of tetraspanin and integrin-mediated cell attachment. Thus, p20 BAP31 can operate upstream of BCL-2 in living cells to influence cell surface properties due to its effects on protein egress from the endoplasmic reticulum.

Regulation of the transport of newly synthesized integral membrane proteins of the ER has important implications for maintaining the integrity of many cell surface functions, and defects in this process are well known to contribute to numerous diseases (16Amara J.F.

In this study, we have investigated the role of BAP31 in maintaining the cell surface expression of small integral membrane proteins called tetraspanins, which are implicated in the regulation of diverse plasma membrane activities.

In addition, some TM4SF proteins associate with intracellular signaling molecules on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, including tyrosine phosphatases (29Carmo A.M. Wright M.D. Eur. J.

Two TM4SF proteins, CD9 and CD81, have been implicated in the maintenance of functional integrins at the cell surface (20Feigelson S.W. Grabovsky V. Shamri R. Levy S. Alon R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry (Mosc). 2003; 68: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The integrin family comprises non-covalent heterodimers of different type I transmembrane protein subunits called α and β, which facilitate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates, including fibronectin (α5β1 and α4β1), laminin (α3β1), and collagens (α2β1) (33Berman A.E.

The ability of integrins to decrease or increase binding of cells to ECM ligands depends on the transition between inactive and active conformations of these receptors (35Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Cellular factors known to induce the activation of integrins include inside-out signaling pathways, integrin clustering, the concentration of Mg2+ and Mn2+ in the extracellular medium, and temperature (35Hughes P.E.

Additionally, specific “activating” and “antagonizing” monoclonal antibodies have been generated that induce a high affinity/avidity conformational change upon binding to particular integrin epitopes (39Clark K.

Moreover, the activation state of integrins, including α5β1, can be monitored by monoclonal antibodies that recognize conformation-dependent integrin epitopes that become exposed only upon changes in integrin conformations associated with changes in the affinity/avidity for ligand (41Tsuchida J. Ueki S. Takada Y. Saito Y. Takagi J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Luque A. Gomez M. Puzon W. Takada Y. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. J. Biol.

Some members of the β1 integrin subfamily, including α5β1 (VLA-5), have been found associated with CD9 and CD81 in the tetraspanin web (20Feigelson S.W. Grabovsky V. Shamri R. Levy S. Alon R. J.

Consistent with this, CD81 has also been implicated in the regulation of α5β1 adhesion strengthening in monocytes and primary mouse B cells (20Feigelson S.W. Grabovsky V. Shamri R. Levy S. Alon R. J.

Moreover, tetraspanins contribute to adhesion-dependent signaling by stimulating recruitment of signaling molecules, such as protein kinase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, into integrin complexes on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (47Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 48Zhang X.A. Bontrager A.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25005-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Changes in integrin-mediated signaling in response to serum starvation, for example, interferes with integrin-transduced survival pathways, alters cytoskeletal organization, and induces a form of programmed cell death called anoikis (49Zhan M. Zhao H. Han Z.C. Histol. Histopathol. 2004; 19: 973-983PubMed Google Scholar). Cells with non-functional or improperly activated integrins are more susceptible to anoikis (30Yauch R.L. Hemler M.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 50Brooks PC Montgomery AM Rosenfeld M Reisfeld RA Hu T Klier G Cheresh DA Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). Here we show by gene deletion that BAP31 controls the egress of tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 to the cell surface and, in so doing, indirectly regulates integrin-mediated cell attachment and survival. In the Fas death pathway, BAP31 is a target of caspase-8, generating p20 BAP31, which induces a pro-apoptotic ER-mitochondrial pathway inhibited by pro-survival BCL-2 (2Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Breckenridge D.G. Stojanovic M. Marcellus R.C. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Of note, p20 BAP31 can also operate upstream of BCL-2 in BCL-2-protected living cells to inhibit egress of tetraspanin to the cell surface and compromise integrin-mediated cell attachment. This novel finding argues that the caspase cleavage product of BAP31 can regulate important cell surface events in cells protected from cell death. Cell Culture, Antibodies, Reagents, and Viral Infection—A C57BL/6 mouse embryonic stem cell line was generated following deletion of the Bap31 gene by homologous recombination and differentiated into epithelial-like cells (13Breckenridge D.G. Nguyen M. Kuppig S. Reth M. Shore G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4331-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The cells were reconstituted with plasmid stably expressing either neomycin (Bap31-null) or BAP31-FLAG (10Wang B. Pelletier J. Massaad M.J. Herscovics A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the cell lines maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in KNOCKOUT™ Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% FBS, 1 mm minimal essential medium, nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml streptomycin sulfate and penicillin, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. KB epithelial cells stably expressing BCL-2 (Bcl-2 cells) have been described previously (51Nguyen, M., Branton, P.E., Roy, S., Nicholson, D.W., Alnemri, E.S., Yeh, W.C., Mak, T.W.Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used in this study: chicken or rabbit anti-human BAP31 (10Wang B. Pelletier J. Massaad M.J. Herscovics A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); rat anti-mouse CD9 (clone KMC8) (Research Diagnostics, Inc.); hamster anti-mouse CD81/TAPA1 (clone EAT2) (eBioscience); mouse anti-β actin (clone C4) (ICN Pharmaceuticals); rabbit anti-γ-actin (2Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); hamster anti-mouse CD51 (integrin αv, clone H9.2B8) (BD Biosciences); rat anti-mouse CD49e (integrin α5, clone 5H10–27) (BD Biosciences); rabbit anti-mouse CD49e (clone H-104) (Santa Cruz Biothechnology); goat anti-mouse CD29 (integrin β1, clone N-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); hamster anti-mouse CD49b (integrin α2, clone Ha1/29) (BD Biosciences); hamster anti-mouse CD61 (integrin β3, clone 2C9.G2) (BD Biosciences); mouse anti-p130CAS (BD Transduction Laboratories); 0.1% solution Fibronectin (Sigma). The construction of Adp20 and AdrtTa and all viral infections were conducted as described previously (14Breckenridge D.G. Stojanovic M. Marcellus R.C. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). FACS Analysis—To assess the cell surface levels of specific tetraspanins and integrins in the presence or absence of BAP31, Bap31-null/Neo and Bap31-null/BAP31-FLAG cells were removed from plates by trypsinization and incubated on ice for 30 min in 50 μl of FACS buffer (PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% NaN3) containing 1.5 μg of specific primary antibodies, either against tetraspanins or integrins. The cells were washed three times with FACS buffer and labeled with a species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody for 30 min on ice. After washing, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur system. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded at 60% confluency on glass coverslips, and then 24 h later were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 23 mm NaH2PO4, and 77 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.3. Cells were permeabilized in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 and then incubated in blocking buffer (10% fetal calf serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). Primary and secondary antibody incubations were done in blocking buffer for 1 h each at room temperature using the indicated antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody coupled to Alexa 488 (green) (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The cells were visualized by conventional fluorescence microscopy using an inverted microscope (TE-FM Epi-fl, Nikon). Purification of ECM and Cell Adhesion Assays—The ECM secreted by the BL6 parental cell line was extracted as follows: 1 × 104 cells/cm2 were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates and cultured for 4 days. Confluent cultures were washed twice with cold PBS, incubated for 10 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS on ice to remove cell membranes, and another 10 min with 0.25 mm ammonium acetate to remove remaining nuclei and cytoskeleton. The remaining ECM was washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated overnight with a solution of 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C to cover exposed plastic surfaces. The ECM was washed once with serum-free medium before use in the adhesion assays. To measure cell-ECM adhesion, confluent Bap31-null/Neo and Bap31-null/BAP31-FLAG cell cultures were collected by light trypsinization, incubated at 37 °C in general medium for 1 h, washed three times with serum-free medium, and suspended at a concentration of 4 × 105cells/ml in serum-free medium. 0.25 ml/well of each cellular suspension was added to purified ECM, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed twice with PBS to remove unattached cells. The remaining attached cells were removed with trypsin and their number determined using a particle counter (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL). Adhesion to fibronectin was measured using 24-well plates coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin or 2 mg/ml poly-l-lysine as a negative control (0.25 ml/well) by overnight incubation at 4 °C, followed by incubation for a minimum of 8 h at 4 °C with 1% bovine serum albumin, and subsequently washing with serum-free medium. The number of adherent cells was determined as described above for adhesion to purified ECM. For experiments with blocking antibodies, the cells were pre-incubated with 5 μg/ml purified antibodies on ice for 30 min, and adhesion assays were performed in the presence of antibodies. Immunoblotting—Confluent cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA) for 1 h at 4°C, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transferring to nitrocellulose membrane, proteins were probed with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies and visualized using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Serum Starvation and Apoptotic Assays—Bap31-null/neo and Bap31-null/BAP31-FLAG cells were plated in 15% FBS KNOCKOUT Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 24 h later the cells were washed with PBS and cultured in 0.5% FBS KNOCKOUT Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 21 and 48 h of serum starvation, cell morphology was examined by phase-contrast microscopy. DEVD-aminomethyl coumarin caspase activity (Upstate Biothechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and Annexin V staining (BioVision, MountView, CA) were conducted according to the manufacturer's protocols. For experiments with blocking antibodies, serum starvation was performed in the presence of 5 μg/ml monoclonal antibodies. Deletion of BAP31 Affects the Surface Expression of Tetraspanins CD81 and CD9 —To investigate the contribution of BAP31 to the cell surface expression of CD81 and CD9, we employed a differentiated C57BL/6 embryoid epithelial-like mouse cell line deleted of the Bap31 gene and stably transfected with plasmid expressing either neo (Bap31-null) or wild-type BAP31-FLAG (Bap31-null/BAP31) (10Wang B. Pelletier J. Massaad M.J. Herscovics A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). For the cell line expressing the wild-type BAP31-FLAG put-back, the expression level of the BAP31-FLAG was similar to the level of Bap31 found in parental C57BL/6 cells. Bap31-null cells were found to express total cellular CD81 and CD9 at levels similar to that of Bap31-null/BAP31 cells, as judged by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). In contrast, FACS analysis using anti-CD9 and anti-CD81 indicated a significant reduction in the cell surface levels of these proteins in cells lacking Bap31 (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the FACS analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy showed that CD9 was enriched and punctuated at the cell surface in Bap31-null/BAP31 cells, but in Bap31-null cells, it was enriched in a perinuclear region of the cell (Fig. 1D). The CD81 antibody was not adequate for this analysis. The results indicate, therefore, that BAP31 does not influence the total amount of CD9 and CD81 expressed by these cells but that BAP31 is required to maintain expression of CD9 and CD81 at the cell surface. BAP31 Promotes Cell Adhesion to Fibronectin without Affecting Cell Surface Expression of α5β1 and αvβ3 Integrins—In view of the fact that CD9 and CD81 are adaptors that influence the activation status of select integrins at the cell surface, we surveyed the Bap31- and Bap31-null/BAP31 cells for their ability to manifest integrin-mediated properties, including attachment to the ECM. To that end, cell culture plates were coated with purified ECM or fibronectin (the component of the ECM that is recognized by α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins). As documented in Fig. 2A, Bap31-null/BAP31 cells displayed a significantly higher cell binding to both ECM and fibronectin compared with Bap31-null cells, whereas the two cell lines bound equally well to poly-l-lysine-coated plates. In contrast to CD9 and CD81, however, overall expression of the two main fibronectin integrin receptors at the cell surface, α5β1 and αvβ3, was not significantly different in either cell line, as demonstrated by flow cytometry; if anything, Bap31-null cells expressed slightly more α5 subunit than did Bap31-null/BAP31 cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, the absence of BAP31 decreases cell adhesion to ECM and fibronectin with no apparent effect on the cell surface expression of α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins. Blocking Cell Surface CD9 Inhibits Attachment of Bap31-null/BAP31 Cells to Fibronectin—To examine the possibility that the reduction in cell attachment to fibronectin in the absence of BAP31 expression was because of the reduced expression of tetraspanin at the surface of these cells, we explored the use of antibodies known to interfere with the function of tetraspanin. Only one antibody was identified that binds and functionally neutralizes certain CD9 functions in mouse (52Oritani K. Wu X. Medina K. Hudson J. Miyake K. Gimble J.M. Burstein S.A. Kincade P.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 2252-2261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When added to Bap31-null/BAP31 cells, this anti-CD9 antibody reduced the binding of these cells to fibronectin, whereas a control antibody (anti-α2) did not (Fig. 2C). Anti-CD9, therefore, recapitulated the reduction in the integrin-mediated cell attachment that was observed due to targeted deletion of Bap31, suggesting that BAP31 maintains integrin function by promoting tetraspanin expression at the cell surface. BAP31 Promotes Cell Attachment by Maintaining Integrin Activity—The Bap31-null and Bap31-null/BAP31 cells are differentiated epithelial-like cells, and epithelial cells are known to require α5β1 and/or αvβ3 for their attachment to fibronectin (20Feigelson S.W. Grabovsky V. Shamri R. Levy S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51203-51212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 53Schultz J.F. Armant D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11522-11531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To further confirm that these integrins were functional in BAP31-expressing cells, treatment of cells with integrin-blocking antibodies, which bind to the activated conformers of α5β1 or αvβ3 integrins and inhibit their interactions with the ECM (53Schultz J.F. Armant D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11522-11531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), were examined. Indeed, when Bap31-null/BAP31 cells were plated on fibronectin in the presence of inhibiting antibody to either α5 and αv integrin subunits, cell adhesion was decreased by half (Fig. 3). Thus, BAP31 maintains integrin activation to facilitate cell attachment to ECM. The fact that anti-α5 antibody also retarded the residual binding of Bap31-null cells to fibronectin suggests that inhibition of α5β1 function following deletion of Bap31 was not absolute. BAP31-expressing Cells Resist Apoptosis Triggered by Serum Deprivation—Many types of cells, including epithelial cells, require appropriate cell-ECM interactions for survival, and they undergo apoptosis in response to stimuli, such as serum depletion, when these anchorage-dependent interactions are lost (54Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar, 55Meredith Jr., J. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Our finding that BAP31 is required to maintain integrin activity at the cell surface suggests that BAP31 should also confer resistance to serum starvation-induced cell death. This was tested by plating Bap31-null and Bap31-null/BAP31 cells in serum-reduced medium and examining their morphology by light microscopy. Bap31-null cells displayed typical apoptotic morphological changes, such as cell rounding, condensation, and detachment, whereas the majority of Bap31-null/BAP31 cells remained attached and well spread even after 42 h of serum starvation (Fig. 4A). In addition to changes in cell morphology, Bap31-null cells (but not Bap31-null/BAP31 cells) displayed a strong induction of effector caspase (DEVDase) activity after 42 h of exposure to low serum (Fig. 4B), which was the time at which maximal DEVDase activity was observed (not shown). This was associated with loss of plasma membrane asymmetry, as demonstrated by annexin V staining (Fig. 4C). The results demonstrated that Bap31-null cells are susceptible to apoptosis in response to serum deprivation and that reconstitution of wild-type BAP31 in these cells maintains resistance to this apoptotic stimulus. Bap31-null/BAP31 Cells Die in Response to Serum Deprivation after Functional Inhibition of Integrins—To confirm that cell surface expression of α5β1 and/or αvβ3 in Bap31-null/BAP31 cells confers resistance to serum starvation-induced cell death, we investigated this stress response in Bap31-null/BAP31 cells in either the presence or the absence of antibodies against α5 and αV, which are known to antagonize the function of the respective integrin. The cells were cultured in medium containing 0.5% FBS without (control) or with blocking antibodies, and the samples were analyzed after 0 and 48 h. Induction of apoptosis was monitored by the appearance of DEVDase activity. As shown in Fig. 5, serum withdrawal induced DEV-Dase activity only in Bap31-null/BAP31 cells treated with blocking antibodies to α5 or αV. Thus, interference with functional α5β1 or αvβ3 in cells expressing wild-type BAP31 recapitulated the sensitivity of Bap31-null cells to serum starvation, arguing that maintenance of functional cell surface integrins by BAP31 confers cell survival in response to serum deprivation. The Caspase-8 Cleavage Product of BAP31 Inhibits Egress of CD9 to the Cell Surface in Human Epithelial Cells Protected by BCL-2—BAP31 is cleaved by caspase-8 following activation of the Fas death pathway upstream of the BCL-2-regulated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (2Nguyen M.

The resulting p20 BAP31 product remains at the ER where it strongly interacts with full-length, uncleaved BAP31 and, independently of this association, initiates a BCL-2-inhibitable pathway that results in mitochondrial fragmentation and sensitization of the organelle to other pro-apoptotic stimuli (4Wang B.

To determine whether the caspase cleavage product of BAP31 influences egress of tetraspanins to the cell surface independently of other potential changes caused by Fas stimulation, p20 BAP31 was ectopically expressed in human KB epithelial cells employing an adenovirus vector (14Breckenridge D.G. Stojanovic M. Marcellus R.C. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). To prevent p20-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, these cells also stably overexpressed BCL-2 (51Nguyen, M., Branton, P.E., Roy, S., Nicholson, D.W., Alnemri, E.S., Yeh, W.C., Mak, T.W.Google Scholar). At 24 h post-infection with Adp20, the caspase-3/7 target p130Cas remained intact (Fig. 6B), and <5% of these p20-expressing cells were scored as apoptotic (Fig. 6D). FACS analysis of the cells revealed, however, that, compared with control adenovirus vector (Ad rTta), p20 BAP31 had indeed interfered with expression of CD9 at the cell surface (Fig. 6C). Similar analyses of CD81 were not conducted because of the quality of the antibody recognizing the human protein. Consequently, Adp20 caused a reduction in cell attachment to fibronectin (Fig. 6E). Because these cells also expressed full-length BAP31 (Fig. 6B), the results clearly showed that the p20 cleavage product is a dominant-interfering protein that compromises the ability of BAP31 to maintain cell surface expression of tetraspanin. In conclusion, we have provided evidence that, similar to mIgD (5Schamel W.W. Kuppig S. Becker B. Gimborn K. Hauri H.P. Reth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 7548-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), cell surface expression of the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 is regulated by BAP31, a resident chaperone located in the ER membrane. As shown here, loss of BAP31 function, although not lethal to differentiated epithelial-like mouse embryonic stem cells, does have predictable outcomes in terms of influencing complex pathways that are expressed at the cell surface. Although loss of BAP31 did not manifest in transport defects of α5β1 or αvβ3 integrins to the cell surface, for example, the compromised transport of CD9 and CD81 tetraspanins indirectly affected the functional integrity of these integrins. As a result, loss of BAP31 correlated with increased sensitivity to the induction of apoptosis by serum starvation. An additional outcome of these findings is the fact that BAP31 exhibits selectivity for the transmembrane proteins which egress out of the ER it supports. Interrogating differences between BAP31-dependent and -independent mechanisms will be important to better understand the export of newly synthesized integral membrane proteins. Importantly, BAP31 itself is a target of regulation during the cellular response to death receptor stimulation (2Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Wang B. Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Stojanovic M. Clemons P.A. Kuppig S. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14461-14468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-8 is a proximal event following death receptor stimulation and results in cleavage of BAP31 upstream of the mitochondrial death pathway, destroying its ability to resist Fas-mediated cell death (2Nguyen M.

J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Conversely, the cleavage product is pro-apoptotic and induces a rapid release of ER Ca2+, initiating a pathway that sensitizes mitochondria to apoptotic stimuli (11Ng. F.W. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 14Breckenridge D.G. Stojanovic M. Marcellus R.C. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In type II epithelial cells, overexpression of BCL-2 prevents cell death induced by Fas stimulation, because the mitochondrial death pathway and ER Ca2+-release are blocked (14Breckenridge D.G. Stojanovic M. Marcellus R.C. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 56Breckenridge D.G. Germain M. Mathai J.P. Nguyen M. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). What we have demonstrated here, however, is that upstream generation of p20 BAP31 by activated caspase-8 in living cells overexpressing BCL-2 could influence the integrity of cell surface functions, including integrin-mediated attachment to extracellular matrices. BAP31 is emerging as an important regulator of the egress of a subset of newly synthesized integral membrane proteins out of the ER, which includes quality control (5Schamel W.W. Kuppig S. Becker B.

Following caspase cleavage of BAP31, it loses its association with actomyosin (2Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Ducret A. Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Shore G.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This, together with potential influences of caspase cleavage on the large BAP31 complex itself, could contribute to the resulting inhibition of the role of BAP31 in supporting the transport of membrane proteins to the cell surface. We thank Dr. Stanners for providing the antibodies to integrins α2 and β3, as well as for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2079449199,"Caspase-9 (Casp-9) induces death signals by triggering other types of caspase activation, and its expression greatly influences the onset of apoptosis. During the isolation of apoptosis-related genes involved in glucocorticoid (GC)-induced cell death in murine thymic lymphomas, we found that the antisense gene of the transcription factor activator protein-4 (AP-4) inhibited dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of Bcl-xL, Bax, and Apaf-1 was not affected in cells transfected with sense or antisense AP-4 genes. In contrast, both the expression and activation of Casp-9 were inhibited in the antisense AP-4 transfectants. We isolated the 2.4-kb 5′-flanking region of Casp-9, and the promoter activity was investigated. We found the AP-4-binding sites at –1.55 and –1.38 kb to be responsible for the promoter activity. Furthermore, a negative cis-element was expected to exist between bases –1140 and –944. When the cells were treated with dexamethasone, a rapid down-regulation of AP-4 and Casp-9 was observed whether the cells were GC-sensitive lymphomas or GC-insensitive L929 fibroblast cells. In addition, L929 cells pretreated with dexamethasone were found to be resistant to subsequent treatment with etoposide, an apoptosis-inducing reagent. GC has a two-sided effect on apoptosis, i.e. a pro-apoptotic effect on certain cell types and a prosurvival effect on other cell types. Our findings will explain, at least in part, this effect.

GC has a two-sided effect on apoptosis, i.e. a pro-apoptotic effect on certain cell types and a prosurvival effect on other cell types. Our findings will explain, at least in part, this effect. Apoptosis is physiological cell death, and it is essential for successful embryonic development and the maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis (1Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Many apoptosis-inducing stimuli induce the apoptotic mechanism by causing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and by inducing the oligomerization of Apaf-1, followed by the recruitment of procaspase-9 into a large complex apoptosome (2Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar, 3Genini D. Budihardjo I. Plunkett W. Wang X. Carrera C.J. Cottam H.B. Carson D.A. Leoni L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). After activation by Apaf-1, caspase (Casp) 1The abbreviations used are: Casp, caspase; GC, glucocorticoid; AS, antisense; AP-4, activator protein-4; HLH, helix-loop-helix. 1The abbreviations used are: Casp, caspase; GC, glucocorticoid; AS, antisense; AP-4, activator protein-4; HLH, helix-loop-helix.-9 initiates a proteolytic cascade by cleaving and activating both Casp-3 and the downstream caspases and thereby inducing cell death. As a result, both Apaf-1 and Casp-9 play a central role in initiating the events of apoptosis, and the level of expression of these two factors also greatly influences the onset of apoptosis. Among the various apoptosis-inducing agents, glucocorticoid (GC) is one of the most well known and is the most widely prescribed compound in current medical practice (4Cidlowski J.A. King K.L. Evans-Storms R.B. Montague J.W. Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 457-490PubMed Google Scholar). GC is used in high doses for the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. GC also plays a major role in attenuating inflammatory responses. GC is expected to exert its apoptotic effect on the lymphocytes and macrophages that are responsible for inflammation. Furthermore, GC also physiologically helps to maintain homeostasis. Thymocytes are highly sensitive to GC-induced apoptosis, especially at the CD4+CD8+ stage (5Gruber J. Sgonc R. Hu Y.H. Beug H. Wick G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). GC is thought to play an important role in eliminating any discarded cells during the selection of T cells in the thymus (6Zacharchuk C.M. Mercep M. June C.H. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 460-465PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, some studies have reported the balance of the signals via the T cell and GC receptors to contribute to the positive selection in the thymus (7Zacharchuk C.M. Mercep M. Chakraborti P.K. Simons Jr., S.S. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4037-4045PubMed Google Scholar, 8Iwata M. Hanaoka S. Sato K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We established a dexamethasone-sensitive CD4+CD8+ thymocyte cell line (2-257-20). With this cell line, we tried to isolate the apoptosis-related genes involved in GC-induced cell death (9Sato M. Matsuki Y. Oguma T. Tsujimoto K. Takayama E. Tadakuma T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). During this investigation, we identified the antisense (AS) activator protein-4 (AP-4) gene as one of the candidates that work to inhibit GC-induced apoptosis. A further analysis revealed that, in the AS AP-4 transfectants, both the expression and activation of Casp-9 were inhibited. In this study, we isolated the 5′-flanking region of Casp-9 and demonstrated the promoter activity of Casp-9 to be dependent on the presence of AP-4. In addition, we demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment rapidly induced AP-4 down-regulation, followed by down-regulation of Casp-9 in both 2-257-20 cells and L929 fibroblast cells, which are resistant to dexamethasone-induced cell death. From the viewpoint of apoptosis, GC has an ambivalent effect depending on the target cells (10Amsterdam A. Tajima K. Sasson R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). GC induces apoptosis in cells of the hematopoietic system such as monocytes and lymphocytes, whereas there is increasing evidence that GC in cells such as hepatocytes and fibroblasts plays a protective role against the apoptotic signals evoked by various other apoptosis-inducing agents. Our findings are discussed with reference to this two-sided effect of GC. Cell Lines—The CD3+CD4+CD8+ thymic cell line 2-257-20 was established as described previously (11Yasutomi D. Odaka C. Saito S. Niizeki H. Kizaki H. Tadakuma T. Immunology. 1992; 77: 68-74PubMed Google Scholar). The cells are sensitive to apoptosis induced by dexamethasone, cAMP, and anti-CD3 antibody. They were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. NIH/3T3 and L929 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cloning of the AS AP-4 Gene—2-257-20 cells were treated with ethyl methanesulfonate (Sigma), and the dexamethasone-resistant cell line 7-15 was selected. The cDNA library was established from this cell line and then inserted into the pPyori-SRα-BX vector. These constructs were transfected into 2-257-20 cells, which express polyomavirus large T antigen upon transfection with the pPyLT-BSD vector, and selected with both blasticidin S hydrochloride (10 μg/ml; Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) and dexamethasone (1 μm). Transfection was performed by the DEAE-dextran method as modified by Takai and Ohmori (12Takai T. Ohmori H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1048: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Three weeks after addition of 1 μm dexamethasone, the surviving cells were isolated, and episomal DNA was collected by the Hirt method. The rescued plasmids were pooled, re-transfected, and then further selected in the presence of blasticidin S hydrochloride and dexamethasone. After a third screening, AP-4 was isolated as an antisense gene. The sample was purified using a BigDye™ DNA sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems), and AP-4 sequence was analyzed using the Applied Biosystems Model 310 DNA sequencing system. Establishment of AP-4 Stable Transfectants—2-257-20 cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. 25 μg of pcDNA-BSD containing an antisense or sense cDNA fragment was added to the cell suspension. Thereafter, electroporation was carried out at 300 V and 960 microfarads with a Gene Pulsar (Bio-Rad). The cells were selected in the presence of blasticidin S hydrochloride (10 μg/ml). In this study, the mock transfectants V30 and V43; the sense AP-4 transfectants S5 and S6; and the AS AP-4 transfectants AS3, AS15, AS23, and AS40 were used. Cell Viability and Determination of Apoptosis-associated Alterations—2-257-20 cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with 1 μm dexamethasone for 24 or 48 h to induce cell death. The cells were harvested, and viability was determined by trypan blue staining. The frequency of subdiploid cells was determined by staining with propidium iodide after permeabilization with Nonidet P-40 and analyzed by flow cytometry. The mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed by flow cytometry after staining with 20 nm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The results of flow cytometry were analyzed using the CellQuest software package. To observe etoposide-induced cell death upon dexamethasone treatment, L929 cells were pretreated with 1 μm dexamethasone for 48 h. Thereafter, 10 or 30 μm etoposide (Sigma) was added, and cell viability was determined after additional incubation for 48 h. When a steroid receptor antagonist was included, 10 μm RU-486 (mifepristone, Sigma) was added to the culture medium 1 h before addition of 1 μm dexamethasone. Antibodies—Antibodies for Western blotting were purchased as follows: anti-Apaf-1 polyclonal antibody (rabbit IgG) from Imgenex Corp., anti-Casp-9 polyclonal antibody (rabbit IgG) from Cell Signaling Technology, anti-Bcl-xL monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG) from Pharmingen, and anti-Bax monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG) and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG) from Sigma. Anti-AP-4 antibody was obtained by injecting rabbits with glutathione S-transferase-AP-4 fusion protein produced using the GST gene fusion system (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—2-257-20 cells and their AP-4 transfectants treated with or without 1 μm dexamethasone were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm EDTA). Total protein was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked using Block Ace for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with anti-AP-4, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-Bax, anti-Apaf-1, or anti-Casp-9 antibody overnight at 4 °C or with anti-β-actin antibody for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and then washed again. Each specific band was detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). L929 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish (Falcon 3004) the day before assay. Cells treated with or without dexamethasone were harvested after treatment with trypsin/EDTA and then subjected to immunoblotting. Quantification of AP-4 and Caspase-9 mRNA Expression by Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from 2-257-20 or L929 cells using RNeasy (Qiagen Inc.). mRNA was reverse-transcribed, and quantitative PCR was performed using a TaqMan Gold RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI Prism 7700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). Both the primers and probes were designed using the Primer Express software package (Applied Biosystems). The primers and probes were as follows: AP-4, 5′-AGTCCCTCAAGACCCTCATTCC-3′ (forward primer), 5′-TCTCCAGCAGACAGCAGAATACA-3′ (reverse primer), and 5′-carboxyfluorescein-ACACAGATGGAGAGAAGCTCAGCAAGGCA-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-3′ (TaqMan probe); Casp-9, 5′-ATGACCACCACAAAGCAGTCC-3′ (forward primer), 5′-CGTGACCATTTTCTTGGCAG-3′ (reverse primer), and 5′-carboxyfluorescein-TTCCGGTGTGCCATCTCCATCAAAG-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-3′ (TaqMan probe); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-ATGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGAC-3′ (forward primer), 5′-TCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCAGG-3′ (reverse primer), and 5′-carboxyfluorescein-CGCCTGGAGAAACCTGCCAAGTATGATGAC-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-3′ (TaqMan probe). Reverse transcription and PCR were performed as a one-step reaction. The reverse transcription conditions were 48 °C for 30 min and AmpliTaq Gold activation at 95 °C for 10 min, and the PCR cycling conditions were 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. A relative standard curve was generated for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in 2-257-20 or L929 cells. Relative quantification of their AP-4, Casp-9, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs was determined from the curve, and AP-4 and Casp-9 mRNAs were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Isolation of the Mouse Casp-9 Promoter Region—Genomic DNA was purified from 2-257-20 cells using a DNeasy™ tissue kit (Qiagen Inc.). Primary and nested PCRs were performed with ExTaq™ (hot start version, TaKaRa, Tokyo). The forward primers were designed based on the rat Casp-9 promoter region sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY027666): 5′-CTCATTACTGCTCTCCCCAGATTTCCTGT-3′ for the primary reaction and 5′-ACCTCAGCTGCTCCTCCCGAGTGTACATCC-3′ for the nested reaction. The reverse primers were designed based on the mouse Casp-9 mRNA: 5′-CGACATGATCGAGGATATTCAGGTGCG-3′ for the primary reaction and 5′-CGAGAGCTCTTCACGCGCGACATGATCGA-3′ for the nested reaction. 1.67 kb of DNA was isolated, and the sequence was clarified. In addition, ∼1 kb of the upstream region was isolated. The forward primers were designed based on the mouse Casp-9 promoter sequence draft data (UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Human Genome Project working draft, available at genome.ucsc.edu/): 5′-GACTGTACAGAGAAACCCTGTCTTG-3′ for the primary reaction and 5′-AAGAACCGAGGGAAGAGGGCGTGGTGAATA-3′ for the nested reaction. The reverse primers were the same as those of the 1.67-kb construct. Ultimately, ∼2.4 kb of DNA was isolated. The three deduced AP-4-binding sites were all submitted to MOTIF: Searching Protein and Nucleic Acid Sequence Motifs (available at www.motif.genome.jp). Mouse Casp-9 Promoter Mutants and Promoter Activity—The 2.4-kb promoter region was inserted into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) by TA cloning and then digested with HindIII and NcoI restriction sites. The multiple cloning site of pCR2.1 has no NcoI site, but the mouse Casp-9 translational start codon was CCATGG. This fragment was cloned into pGL3-Basic at the cohesive ends and then used as a template to generate the AP-4-binding site point mutants and 5′-sequential deletion mutants. Seven AP-4-binding site point mutants were prepared: three of them had a one point mutation; three had two point mutations; and the last had three point mutations. The forward primers of the one-point mutants were 5′-ACCCTCCTCCCGAGTGTACATCCT-3′, 5′-ACCTCATCAAGGAATAACTATATCCCTGTC-3′, and 5′-ACCGTCCTCTTTACCCTGAACCATCCATCTC-3′, and the reverse primers were 5′-CCAGATTTCCTGTTTGTAAATTCACCTTAT-3′, 5′-CGCTGTGAGATCCCTGACACATGTCTATAT-3′, and 5′-GACCTCTGGAAGAATAT-3′, respectively. The underlined regions indicate the replaced bases that have been described in a previous study (13King-Jones K. Korge G. Lehmann M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). First, one-point mutants were generated; then these constructs were used as templates for the two-point mutants; and one of the three two-point mutants were used as a template for the three-point mutant. The 5′-sequential deletion mutants were 1.55, 1.37, 1.14, and 0.94 kb. The forward primers were 5′-ACCTCAGCTGCTCCTCCCGAGTGTACATCC-3′, 5′-ATCAAGGAATAACTATATCCCTGTCAGGA-3′, 5′-CCTCTTTACCCTGAACCATCCATCTC-3′, and 5′-GTGTTCTTAACCGCTGAGCCATCTCTCCAG-3′, respectively. The reverse primer was the same for the four constructs, 5′-CTGCGATCTAAGTAAGCTT-3′. These constructs and pGL3-Basic were transfected with phRL (inner control DNA; Promega) into 2-257-20 cells by the DEAE-dextran method or into NIH/3T3 cells by jetPEI (Polyplus Transfection). The luciferase activities were measured after 48 h with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—2-257-20 cell nuclear extracts were purified with NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (Pierce). Each probe (double-strand DNA) was designed for each AP-4-binding site to be located in the center of the probe and labeled with 32P. A negative control that could not bind to the AP-4-binding sites was also generated (13King-Jones K. Korge G. Lehmann M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract, poly(dI-dC), binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and 4 mm dithiothreitol), and the 32P-labeled probe were mixed on ice for 1 h to achieve the binding reaction. Both the competition and supershift tests were performed by incubating nuclear extract with a large number of unlabeled probes or anti-AP-4 antibody for 1 h before the binding reaction. Samples were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gel. The dried gels were exposed on an image plate and analyzed using a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer. Statistical Analysis—Differences were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E., and a p value <0.05 was considered to be significant. Dexamethasone-induced Cell Death Is Inhibited in the AS AP-4 Transfectants—Using functional cloning, we isolated several genes that could inhibit GC-induced apoptosis. Many of the candidate genes were AS genes, and one of them was the AS gene of the basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factor AP-4. We analyzed the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA and deduced the amino sequence of AP-4 (GenBank™ accession number AF161262). The cDNA is 2124 bp, and the open reading frame starts at base 205 and ends at base 1218. The basic HLH motif and two leucine repeat motifs are observed. Several vector-alone and AS AP-4 transfectants were established, and cell death was induced by treatment with 1 μm dexamethasone. At 0, 24, and 48 h, the cells were harvested, and cell viability was determined (Fig. 1A). All four AS AP-4 stable transfectants showed a reduced susceptibility to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in comparison with the vector-alone transfectants, especially at the 24-h assessment. Sense AP-4 transfectants were also established and similarly investigated. An increase in cell death was observed at various doses of dexamethasone (data not shown). The induction of apoptosis causes various alterations in cells. One of the typical events in apoptosis is the fragmentation of nuclear DNA, and this phenomenon can be detected as the appearance of subdiploid cells by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1B, the frequency of subdiploid cells at 24 h was reduced in the AS AP-4 transfectants. Another typical event during apoptosis is the disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. This disruption was also reduced in the AS AP-4 transfectants (Fig. 1C). Expression of the Factors Involved in the Apoptosis Pathway in the AP-4 Transfectants—Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis is mediated by the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, and in various cells, the balance of repressive and promotive factors of the Bcl-2 family is known to influence the mitochondrial pathway (14Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 expression is barely detectable in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (15Moore N.C. Anderson G. Williams G.T. Owen J.J. Jenkinson E.J. Immunology. 1994; 81: 115-119PubMed Google Scholar, 16Veis D.J. Sentman C.L. Bach E.A. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2546-2554PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chao D.T.

Med. 1995; 182: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and in this experiment, the expression of Bcl-xL and Bax was examined (Fig. 2A). There were no big differences in their expression levels among the vector-alone and sense and AS AP-4 transfectants. Furthermore, we could not detect any differences in the mRNA expression of Bcl-xL, Bak, Bax, and Bad in an RNase protection assay (data not shown). Apaf-1 and Casp-9 are critical factors in the initiation of the cascade of cleavage and activation of other caspases, thus resulting in eventual cell death. The expression of Apaf-1 did not differ substantially among the AP-4 transfectants (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the expression of procaspase-9 was suppressed in the AS AP-4 transfectants (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the kinetics of Casp-9 expression after treatment with 1 μm dexamethasone showed the appearance of the activated form of Casp-9 to be delayed (Fig. 2D). Subsequently, we evaluated the expression of Casp-9 mRNA by real-time PCR, and its expression was increased in sense AP-4 transfectants, but decreased in AS AP-4 transfectants (data not shown). AP-4 and Promoter Activity of Casp-9—We isolated ∼2.4 kb of the upstream region of the mouse Casp-9 gene by the nested PCR method (Supplemental Fig. 1). Three AP-4-binding sites were presumed to be on the 5′-flanking region of Casp-9. To evaluate the relationship between these sites and the Casp-9 promoter activity, we prepared five deletion and seven point mutation constructs. They were inserted into the pGL3-Basic reporter gene vector containing firefly luciferase cDNA and then transfected into 2-257-20 cells. The control vector containing Renilla luciferase cDNA was cotransfected, and Dual-Luciferase reporter assay was performed. A remarkable reduction in the promoter activity was observed when the two distal AP-4-binding sites at –1.55 and –1.38 kb were mutated (Fig. 3A). In addition, in the deletion constructs containing 1373- and 1140-bp promoter sequences, the promoter activities decreased remarkably (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that a negative cis-element exists between bases –1140 and –944. The experiments were repeated with NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 3C). Again, the results clearly demonstrated the AP-4-binding sites at –1.55 and –1.38 kb to be important. Furthermore, the presence of a negative cis-element between bases –1140 and –944 was confirmed. To clarify whether the binding site of the AP-4 sequence is directly involved, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed (Fig. 4A). We prepared 31-bp oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the three AP-4-binding sites, and all of them were found to form complexes with nuclear protein extracts. These complexes disappeared upon addition of a 100-fold excess of an unlabeled probe, and the complexes were super-shifted when the AP-4-specific antibody was included (Fig. 4B). These results strongly suggest these three binding sites to be specific for the transcription factor AP-4. Kinetics of AP-4 and Casp-9 Expression after Dexamethasone Treatment—To evaluate the physiological function of dexamethasone treatment and AP-4, the expression of AP-4 mRNA and protein was examined at various times after dexamethasone treatment. The expression of mRNA in 2-257-20 cells rapidly decreased, and a significant reduction was observed at 2 h (Fig. 5A). The down-regulation of AP-4 at the protein level was detected at 4 h (Fig. 5B). Following AP-4 down-regulation, the Casp-9 mRNA level also decreased after 2 h (Fig. 5C). To investigate whether the differences in the AP-4 levels in various transfectants correlated with both the level of Casp-9 and the induction of apoptosis, we treated three transfectants with 1 μm dexamethasone (Fig. 5D). The sense and AS AP-4 plasmids are driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, and therefore, their expression would not be much influenced by dexamethasone treatment. In the sense AP-4 transfectant, down-regulation of Casp-9 was less because of the presence of AP-4, and the induction of apoptosis was accelerated. In contrast, in the antisense AP-4 transfectant, the low level of Casp-9 from the start delayed the onset of apoptosis. We next examined whether this series of events, dexamethasone/AP-4/Casp-9, is observed in fibroblast cells, which are resistant to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. We examined the expression of AP-4 mRNA and protein in mouse L929 fibroblast cells (Fig. 6, A and B), and a significant down-regulation of mRNA was clearly observed after 6 h and also at the protein level. L929 cells themselves are not induced to undergo cell death by dexamethasone. However, if AP-4 expression is down-regulated by dexamethasone treatment, it is expected that L929 cells pretreated with dexamethasone would be resistant to subsequent treatment with apoptosis-inducing agents. This assumption was tested in Fig. 6 (C and Fig. D). As shown in Fig. 6C, L929 cells pretreated with dexamethasone for 48 h demonstrated a decrease in the expression of AP-4 and Casp-9, and this decrease was blocked in the presence of the steroid receptor antagonist RU-486. In this situation, the cells were further treated with the anticancer drug etoposide, which is reported to induce apoptosis via Casp-9 (18Wu G.S. Ding Z. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Suppression of cell death was observed in the cells pretreated with dexamethasone (Fig. 6D).Fig. 6Dexamethasone treatment results in the down-regulation of AP-4 in L929 cells and causes the cells to prevent apoptosis induced by etoposide. L929 cells were treated with 1 μm dexamethasone, and the expression of AP-4 at the mRNA (A) and protein (B) levels was assessed at various hours. L929 cells were treated with 1 μm dexamethasone (Dex) and/or 10 μm RU-486 for 48 h (C). RU-486 was added to the cells 1 h before addition of dexamethasone. The expression of AP-4 and Casp-9 was assessed by Western blot analysis. L929 cells pretreated with (▪) or without (□) dexamethasone for 48 h were further incubated in the presence of 10 or 30 μm etoposide (D). Cell viability was determined 48 h after addition of etoposide. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we have demonstrated that the transcription factor AP-4 directly bound to the promoter region of Casp-9 and regulated the expression of Casp-9. Casp-9 is an initiator of a cascade of cleavage and activation of other caspases, and the deletion of Casp-9 from cell extracts abrogates the cytochrome c-inducible activation of Casp-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -10 (19Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). Casp-9 therefore plays a critical role in the induction of apoptosis and is regulated at various levels. Casp-9 requires cytochrome c, Apaf-1, and ATP to form a huge complex “apoptosome,” and the lack of any component greatly influences the activation of Casp-9 (2Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar, 3Genini D. Budihardjo I. Plunkett W. Wang X. Carrera C.J. Cottam H.B. Carson D.A. Leoni L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of Casp-9 is regulated by the presence of cIAP and XIAP (20Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Recently, Allan et al. (21Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) reported another regulation mechanism, i.e. the inhibition of Casp-9 through phosphorylation at Thr125 by ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) mitogen-activated protein kinase. In this study, we identified a new regulation mechanism for the expression of Casp-9. Until now, most experiments on the regulation of apoptosis have concentrated on the interaction of pro-apoptotic and contra-apoptotic factors. However, several studies have already reported on regulation via transcription factors such as the expression of Bax and Noxa by p53 (22Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 23Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Science. 2000; 288: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). The enhancer binding protein AP-4 is a transcription factor that activates both viral and cellular genes by binding to symmetrical DNA sequences (CAGCTG) (24Hu Y.-F. Luscher B. Admon A. Mermod N. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1741-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). AP-4 has a HLH motif. Like other members of this family, the AP-4 HLH motif and the adjacent basic domain are necessary to confer site-specific DNA binding. However, unlike other HLH motif-containing proteins, AP-4 also contains two additional protein dimerization motifs consisting of leucine repeat elements LR1 and LR2. AP-4 binds the other leucine repeats to each other and thereby makes a dimer, but AP-4 is not considered to make a heterodimer. AP-4 has been reported to bind many promoters and enhancers of various genes (25Mermod N. Williams T.J. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 332: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 26Fodor E.

Ra C. Shirai T. Hirose S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4340-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As an enhancer, AP-4 binds to the specific genes of pancreatic cells; for example, it is well known that the amylase-2A gene is regulated by AP-4 (26Fodor E. Weinrich S.L. Meister A. Mermod N. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8102-8108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the field of immunology, AP-4 has been reported to be a ligand of immunoglobulin κ-chain E-box elements (30Aranburu A. Carlsson R. Persson C. Leanderson T. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas the AP-4-binding site of Fcgr2b, which is responsible for the negative regulation of the B cell antigen receptor, is deleted in autoimmunodeficient New Zealand Black mice (31Xiu Y. Nakamura K. Abe M. Li N. Wen X.S. Jiang Y. Zhang D. Tsurui H. Matsuoka S. Hamano Y. Fujii H. Ono M. Takai T. Shimokawa T. Ra C. Shirai T. Hirose S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4340-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, there has yet to be a report on AP-4 concerning apoptosis-related genes as far as we could determine. In AS AP-4 transfectants, Casp-9 expression decreased at both the protein and mRNA levels. In contrast, it was a surprise that the increase in the expression of Casp-9 was small in the sense AP-4 transfectants. AP-4 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor and probably works to maintain the basic level of Casp-9. Therefore, AP-4 at more than a certain level would not much influence the expression of Casp-9, although the precise mechanism must await further investigations, including the possibility of the involvement of other transcription factors. We isolated the 5′-flanking region of Casp-9 and thus found three AP-4-binding sites to exist. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed these binding sequences to be specific for AP-4, and two distal binding sites (–1.55 and –1.38 kb) had a strong promoter activity. The sequence of the Casp-9 promoter region has already been described in the rat (32Nishiyama J. Yi X. Venkatachalam M.A. Dong Z. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 49-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found four AP-4-binding sites in MOTIF; two of them were located at –1.52 and –1.35 kb, and these positions were very similar to those in mouse Casp-9. Although the expression of Casp-9 mRNA has been reported to double under hypoxic conditions, the transcriptional regulation of AP-4 has not yet been examined. It will be interesting to clarify whether Casp-9 is similarly regulated in the rat and human. During an analysis of the promoter activity in deletion construct experiments, we found a negative cis-element to exist between bases –1140 and –944. Therefore, a decrease in the quantity of AP-4 causes a reduction in Casp-9 expression. Quite a similar situation has been demonstrated in the Fas antigen, in which a silencer exists between bases –1035 and –1008, and the presence of an enhancer just adjacent to the silencer between bases –1007 and –964 was reported (33Rudert F. Visser E. Forbes L. Lindridge E. Wang Y. Watson J. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Rudert F. Lindridge E. Lasham A. Wang Y. Grandison P. Watson J.

In this study, we have focused our efforts on AP-4 and Casp-9. However, as determined by the kinetics of AP-4 and Casp-9 down-regulation (Fig. 5, A–C), there is a possibility that dexamethasone treatment induces other factors that are involved in Casp-9 down-regulation. This possibility will be investigated in the future experiments. GC plays a major role in the attenuation of the inflammatory response. Steroid hormones can induce apoptosis in hematopoietic cells such as T lymphocytes, which are involved in the inflammation reaction (36Schwartzman R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1994; 105: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, GC has been reported recently to protect fibroblasts, hepatocytes, etc., which are vulnerable to the inflammation reaction, against apoptosis induced by other reagents (37Yamamoto M. Fukuda K. Miura N. Suzuki R. Kido T. Komatsu Y. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Iida N. Sugiyama A. Myoubudani H. Inoue K. Sugamata M. Ihara T. Ueno Y.

Investig. 1993; 16: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GC is frequently used as a co-treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer cells to reduce side effects (40Evans-Storms R.B. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast to the pro-apoptotic effect of GC in malignant lymphoid cells, GC also sometimes induces resistance to cancer therapy mediated-apoptosis in solid tumors. Recently, Herr et al. (41Herr I. Ucur E. Herzer K. Okouoyo S. Rudiger R. Krammer P.H. von Knebel-Doeberitz M. Debatin K.-M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3112-3120PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the expression of most pro-apoptotic factors, including CD95L, Trail, Casp-9, and Casp-8, is down-regulated in carcinomas pretreated with dexamethasone. They further demonstrated that the transfection of Casp-8 and Casp-9 cDNAs or proteins neutralizes resistance to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. In this work, we have demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment induced the down-regulation of AP-4 in 2-257-20 thymic lymphoma cells and in L929 fibroblast cells, followed by the down-regulation of Casp-9. In addition, apoptosis was not induced in L929 cells by dexamethasone treatment itself, but dexamethasone-treated L929 cells were found to be resistant to apoptosis induced by subsequent treatment with etoposide. Based on our observations, we speculate that, in GC-sensitive cells, the expression level of AP-4 will influence the sensitivity to apoptosis. However, once the pro-apoptotic signals are triggered by GC, the subsequent down-regulation of AP-4 and Casp-9 will not be sufficient for the prosurvival response. In contrast, in GC-insensitive cells, the pretreatment with GC induces the down-regulation of Casp-9 and thus contributes to the resistance against subsequent treatment with apoptosis-inducing agents. We are currently investigating how the down-regulation of AP-4 is induced by GC and whether our findings are related to the attenuation of inflammation observed upon GC treatment. We thank Dr. N. Kondo for help in performing the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and N. Sakamoto for excellent secretarial work. Download .pdf (.19 MB) Help with pdf files"

The overall effect of this trio of post-translational modification steps is an increase in the hydrophobicity of the modified protein, directing otherwise soluble proteins to their proper intracellular membrane location. Ste14p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the founding member of a homologous family of Icmt enzymes present in all eukaryotic organisms (13Sapperstein S. Berkower C. Michaelis S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Ste14p is a 26-kDa integral membrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and contains six putative transmembrane spans. A 33-kDa functional human ortholog of the yeast protein, hIcmt (also called pcCMT), which is also localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, was recently identified and characterized (11Dai Q.

The yeast and human Icmt share 41% identity and 63% similarity, overall, suggesting that their three-dimensional structures and mechanisms of action are similar. In fact, human Icmt expressed in yeast complements a ste14Δ deletion (11Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J. Slivka S.R. Steitz S.A. Michaelis S. Philips M.R. J. Biol.

We have recently overexpressed both yeast and human Icmt in S. cerevisiae to high levels and characterized their activities in vitro (14Anderson J.L. Frase H. Michaelis S. Hrycyna C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7336-7345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, this study). Both of these Icmt variants recognize and modify both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated substrates (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev.

To date, the nature of the isoprenylcysteine binding site in all Icmt enzymes remains relatively unexplored. Previous studies have indicated that the isoprene moiety is a crucial recognition element for Icmt, as the minimal compounds N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine (AFC) and N-acetyl-S-geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine (AGGC) are good substrates (1Zhang F.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 7336-7345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, aminoacyl modifications were also shown to block protein methylation by crude Icmt (16Marciano D. Ben-Baruch G. Marom M. Egozi Y. Haklai R. Kloog Y. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Ding J. Lu D.J. Perez-Sala D. Ma Y.T. Maddox J.F. Gilbert B.A. Badwey J.A. Rando R.R. J. Biol.

In this study, to explore the substrate specificity of Icmt, we focused on the isoprene moiety itself via the synthesis of N-acetyl isoprenylcysteine analogs. Our goals are to use these synthetic compounds as tools for further biochemical exploration of the mechanism of action of the enzyme and starting points for the development of inhibitors. Icmt has emerged as a particularly intriguing target for potential anticancer agents, especially against K-Ras. K-Ras is the most commonly mutated form of Ras found in human malignancies, particularly in solid malignancies (18Adjei A.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1062-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Targeted inactivation of the Icmt gene in mammalian cells led to a profound mislocalization of K-Ras and a blockage of its ability to promote cellular transformation (19Bergo M.O. Gavino B.J. Hong C.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17605-17610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that blocking the methylation of K-Ras blocks its association with microtubules, which may be crucial for the localization and biological activity of this Ras variant. These findings suggest that the development of inhibitors of the methylation step may prove to be useful for the treatment of human cancers (22Clarke S. Tamanoi F. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Recently, potent FTase inhibitors have exhibited promise as anticancer agents in human clinical trials. These inhibitors are thought to have multiple cellular targets, including some Ras proteins. Although these agents can inhibit the growth of H-Ras tumors, they have surprisingly little effect on many K-Ras-transformed tumor types. Importantly, K-Ras can be alternatively geranylgeranylated in the presence of FTase inhibitors whereas H-Ras is not (24Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J.

Recent studies with Icmt–/– fibroblasts have indicated that the methylation of K-Ras proteins by Icmt plays a central role in the cellular localization and transformation ability of this key oncoprotein (19Bergo M.O. Gavino B.J. Hong C. Beigneux A.P. McMahon M. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Bergo M.O. Leung G.K. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C.

Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17605-17610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Combined, these data provide compelling reasons that inhibitors of Icmt have great potential as novel anticancer agents (22Clarke S. Tamanoi F. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Many signaling proteins undergo -CAAX processing, and inhibiting Icmt could also target the abnormally high activity of these other signaling proteins in tumor cells, regardless of the specific prenyl group attached to the protein. However, although a recent study confirms that methylation is required for the proper localization of Ras, it also demonstrates that the modification is not necessary for localization of the Rho proteins, another class of CAAX proteins (26Michaelson D. Ali W. Chiu V.K. Bergo M. Silletti J. Wright L. Young S.G. Philips M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1606-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This differential effect was linked to the fact that Ras is farnesylated, and the Rho proteins are geranylgeranylated, suggesting that Icmt inhibition will have a much more profound inhibitory effect on the activity of farnesylated proteins, such as Ras, than geranylgeranylated proteins. To study both the nature of the substrate binding site as well as to develop potentially useful inhibitors of Icmt, modified analogs of the minimal Icmt substrate AFC, 1 (Fig. 1B), were synthesized (Fig. 2) (27Brown M.J. Milano P.D. Lever D.C. Epstein W.W. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 3176-3177Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and evaluated as substrates and inhibitors of Icmt using crude membrane preparations from yeast cells overexpressing either Ste14p or human Icmt. These compounds were found to vary widely in their ability to act as substrates, and revealed structural requirements of the key isoprene moiety necessary for recognition by Icmt. Two of the compounds synthesized, the isobutenyl derivative, 3, and the isobutenyl biphenyl derivative, 4, were selected for further study because of their minimal substrate activity, combined with significant inhibitory activity. Both compounds were found to be inhibitors of both yeast and human Icmt in micromolar concentrations. Such inhibitors may be valuable lead compounds for the development of novel anticancer agents (22Clarke S. Tamanoi F. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar).

Cloning of Human Icmt—Wild-type human Icmt (hIcmt) cDNA was a generous gift from S. Michaelis (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). The hIcmt gene was amplified by PCR after removal of an internal EagI restriction site, which does not result in a change in the amino acid sequence, and the product cloned into the pCHH10m3N vector. The resulting plasmid was pCHH10m3N-hIcmt (His-hIcmt). The plasmid was sequenced bidirectionally to confirm the DNA sequence. Isolation of Membrane Fraction from Yeast Cells—Membrane fractions from yeast cells were isolated as previously described (14Anderson J.L. Frase H. Michaelis S. Hrycyna C.A. J. Biol.

The assay mixture contained a total volume of 60 μl and a final Tris-HCl concentration of 100 mm, pH 7.5. All reactions contained 20 μm S-adenosyl-[14C-methyl]methionine and 5 μg of membrane protein from the His-Ste14p-overexpressing strain CH2704 or the His-hIcmt-overexpressing strain CH2766. Substrate curves were generated by varying the amount of compound in each reaction. Inhibition curves were generated by varying the amount of compound in each reaction while in the presence of 33 μm AFC. KI curves were generated by varying the amount of AFC in the presence of a constant concentration of 3 or 4. 3 was dissolved in ethanol. 1 and 4 were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. In all cases, the solvent was kept at a final concentration of <1% (v/v). The 60-μl reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 50 μl of 1 m NaOH/1% SDS. 100 μl of this mixture was spotted on folded filter paper (5.5 cm × 1.5 cm) and lodged in the neck of a scintillation vial containing 10 ml of scintillation fluid and capped to allow for diffusion of the released [14C]methanol into the scintillant. The filters were pulled out after 2–3 h, the vials were shaken, and counted in a liquid scintillation analyzer.

For substrate curves with purified His-Ste14p, liposomes containing substrate were prepared by rapid filtration through a Sephacryl S-100 high resolution (Amersham Biosciences) column, the substrate concentration was quantified, and the liposomes used in in vitro vapor diffusion methyltransferase assays as previously described (14Anderson J.L.

For inhibition assays, both the substrate, AFC, and the inhibitor, either compound 3 or compound 4, were incubated with lipid. The substrate was at a constant concentration (50 μm), and the inhibitor was in increasing concentrations. The purified protein was reconstituted, and in vitro vapor diffusion methyltransferase assays were performed as previously described (14Anderson J.L. Frase H. Michaelis S. Hrycyna C.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2139287136,"We have developed yeast as an expression and genetic system for functional studies of the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which cleaves and inactivates certain small peptide molecules, including insulin and the neurotoxic Aβ peptide. We show that heterologously expressed rat IDE is enzymatically active, as judged by the ability of IDE-containing yeast extracts to cleave insulin in vitro. We also show that IDE can promote the in vivo production of the yeast a-factor mating pheromone, a function normally attributed to the yeast enzymes Axl1p and Ste23p. However, IDE cannot substitute for the function of Axl1p in promoting haploid axial budding and repressing haploid invasive growth, activities that require an uncharacterized activity of Axl1p. Particulate fractions enriched for Axl1p or Ste23p are incapable of cleaving insulin, suggesting that the functional conservation of these enzymes may not be bidirectionally conserved. We have made practical use of our genetic system to confirm that residues composing the extended zinc metalloprotease motif of M16A family enzymes are required for the enzymatic activity of IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p. We have determined that IDE and Axl1p both require an intact C terminus for optimal activity. We expect that the tractable genetic system that we have developed will be useful for investigating the enzymatic and structure/function properties of IDE and possibly for the identification of novel IDE alleles having altered substrate specificity.

In animal models, IDE deficiency correlates with increased levels of insulin and Aβ and increased risks of type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease (4Farris W. Mansourian S. Chang Y. Lindsley L. Eckman E.A. Frosch M.P. Eckman C.B. Tanzi R.E. Selkoe D.J. Guenette S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4162-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 5Leissring M.A. Farris W.

Despite these and other findings, the biological role of IDE and its importance in the clearance of insulin and Aβ remains to be fully clarified (7Tanzi R.E. Moir R.D. Wagner S.L. Neuron. 2004; 43: 605-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The Ste23p and Axl1p proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have significant sequence homology to IDE (36 and 19% identity, respectively) (8Fujita A. Oka C. Arikawa Y. Katagai T. Tonouchi A. Kuhara S. Misumi Y. Nature. 1994; 372: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Genetic and mutational studies indicate that Ste23p and Axl1p are required for the proteolytic maturation of the yeast a-factor mating pheromone, a lipid-modified peptide that is produced by a multistep process (9Adames N. Blundell K. Ashby M.N. Boone C. Science. 1995; 270: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 10Chen P. Sapperstein S. Choi J.D. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This pheromone is produced by MATa haploid cells and is required for yeast mating, the fusion of MATa and MATα haploid cells to form a diploid cell. Although Ste23p and Axl1p can independently promote a-factor maturation, the enzymes are not fully redundant. Ste23p is significantly less efficient than Axl1p at producing biologically active pheromone (9Adames N. Blundell K. Ashby M.N. Boone C. Science. 1995; 270: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Axl1p has several cellular roles. In addition to its role in pheromone production, Axl1p is required for the efficient post-conjugation fusion of haploid mating partners (11Elia L. Marsh L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1473-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This role may be indirectly related to the ability of Axl1p to produce a-factor, because limiting levels of pheromone similarly lead to fusion defects (12Brizzio V. Gammie E. Nijbroek G.L. Michaelis S. Rose M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1727-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Axl1p is also required for maintenance of the axial budding pattern that is characteristic of haploid yeast (8Fujita A. Oka C. Arikawa Y. Katagai T. Tonouchi A. Kuhara S. Misumi Y. Nature. 1994; 372: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Adames N. Blundell K. Ashby M.N. Boone C. Science. 1995; 270: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the absence of Axl1p, haploid yeasts exhibit a bipolar budding pattern that is typical of diploid cells. The function of Axl1p in this process does not require its proteolytic activity, suggesting that Axl1p is a bi-functional enzyme (9Adames N. Blundell K. Ashby M.N. Boone C. Science. 1995; 270: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Axl1p also represses the invasive growth of haploid yeast (13Palecek S.P. Parikh A.S. Kron S.J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1005-1023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cullen P.J. Sprague Jr., G.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2990-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the proteolytic, bud site selection, or another activity of Axl1p is required for this process has not been reported. By contrast to Axl1p, the only reported cellular role for Ste23p is in a-factor production. Additional functions for this enzyme are likely because Ste23p is expressed in both the MATα and diploid cell types that do not produce a-factor. 2S. Kim, A. N. Lapham, C. G. K. Freedman, T. L. Reed, and W. K. Schmidt, unpublished observations. IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p are members of the M16A protease subfamily. M16A proteases are characterized by a core inverted zinc metalloprotease motif that is typically located within the first 200 residues of these enzymes and a pair of glutamic acid residues that are 70 and 77 amino acids distal to the core motif (i.e. HXXEHX69EX6E). The spacing between the core motif and the distal glutamates is invariant for all 46 M16A enzymes identified so far, except in the case of Axl1p where the spacing is 76 residues. The histidine residues and most distal glutamate residue are putative zinc ligands, and mutational alteration of these residues inactivates IDE and Axl1p (9Adames N. Blundell K. Ashby M.N. Boone C. Science. 1995; 270: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Perlman R.K. Gehm B.D. Kuo W.L. Rosner M.R. J. Biol.

Some members of the M16A subfamily, including IDE, are sensitive to thiol modifiers, suggesting that a cysteine residue(s) is critical for proper structure of the active site or the overall tertiary or quaternary structure of these proteins (1Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Perlman R.K. Gehm B.D. Kuo W.L. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21538-21544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of IDE and its yeast orthologs reveals two conserved cysteine residues. One is within the core metalloprotease motif, and this residue can reportedly be altered without affecting enzymatic activity (15Perlman R.K. Gehm B.D. Kuo W.L. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21538-21544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other conserved cysteine is exactly 67 amino acids distal to the extended motif (HXXEHX69EX6EX67C). This distal cysteine is not conserved in Escherichia coli Protease III, a bacterial M16A enzyme that is insensitive to thiol modifiers (17Ding L. Becker A.B. Suzuki A. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2414-2420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p has prompted us to investigate the hypothesis that these proteins have conserved enzymatic properties and substrate specificity. To this end, we present evidence indicating that rat IDE can substitute for Axl1p and Ste23p in a-factor production but not for the other known functions of Axl1p. More importantly, these findings establish yeast as a genetically tractable system for future studies of IDE function. We have made practical use of this system to create and characterize novel mutations that alter the enzymatic properties of IDE.

An NcoI site was inserted immediately prior to the stop codon of AXL1 into which a DNA fragment encoding a triply iterated HA tag was inserted; in actuality, two tandem copies of the tag were inserted. The plasmid was further modified to delete a portion of the 5′-untranslated region corresponding to an XhoI fragment in order to reduce the overall size of this plasmid from 12.1 to 10.6 kb; this deletion had no effect on protein expression. pWS482 (CEN URA3 STE23-2HA) was created by modifying p137 in a similar manner to that described for p80. In this instance, a BamHI site was introduced immediately prior to the stop codon of STE23 into which a triply iterated HA tag was inserted; as with pWS371, two tandem copies of the tag were actually inserted. pWS511 (2μ URA3 PPGK-IDE-HA) was created by PCR amplification of IDE from pSRα-rat IDE such that the PCR product had ends homologous to the parent yeast vector (pSM703) and a BglII restriction site immediately before the stop codon of IDE (21Seta K.A. Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The BglII site was used for insertion of the triply iterated HA epitope tag. pWS496 is identical to pWS511 except that it contains two copies of the triply iterated HA tag. Restriction digest analysis and DNA sequencing were used to confirm the presence of the tag in each of the plasmids described above. The general strategy for the creation of site-directed mutations in the above plasmids also involved PCR-directed recombination-mediated plasmid construction. In brief, a DNA fragment encoding an appropriate segment of the target open reading frame was amplified by PCR where one of the oligonucleotides contained the mutation of interest and typically a silent restriction site. The DNA fragments were co-transformed with a target plasmid that had been linearized or gapped with restriction enzymes near the intended site of mutation. Recombinant plasmids were recovered from yeast, amplified in E. coli, and screened by restriction analysis and/or sequencing to verify the presence of the mutation. All mutant alleles were confirmed by immunoblot to encode the full-length protein. The epitope tagging of Ste23p was not straightforward. DNA sequencing of an intermediate plasmid in the construction pWS482 revealed an extra nucleotide near the 3′ end of the open reading frame that was not present in the public sequence of STE23. The presence of the extra nucleotide was confirmed in the STE23 sequence derived from three different sources: p137 and PCR products derived from chromosomal amplification of the STE23 gene from two distinct strain backgrounds (IH1783 and YPH499). An independent group (22Brachat S. Dietrich F.S. Voegeli S. Zhang Z. Stuart L. Lerch A. Gates K. Gaffney T. Philippsen P. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has proposed recently the identical sequence annotation as part of an effort to identify mistakes in published genome sequences. The extra nucleotide alters and extends the translation of the STE23 open reading frame such that amino acids 971–988 now code for 18 distinct amino acids and an additional 39 amino acids are gained as an extension to the original proposed translation. Protein Extract Preparations—Whole cell protein extracts for Western analysis were prepared by the NaOH/trichloroacetic acid method (23Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In brief, mid-log cells (an amount equivalent to 2 ml of a 1.0 A600 culture) were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with cold water, resuspended in 1 ml of cold water, and treated with a solution of 2 n NaOH, 1 m β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins released were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (11.5% final), recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in Urea Sample Buffer (USB; 250 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 6 m urea, 4% SDS, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), heated, and cleared of insoluble material before analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. HA-tagged proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Roche Applied Science) after immunodecorating proteins with mouse anti-HA and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies. Particulate fractions used for in vitro assays were prepared by mechanical breakage of yeast cells expressing either IDE, Ste23p, or Axl1p (24Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 25Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6227-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In brief, mid-log cells were harvested, washed with cold 10 mm NaN3, and treated with Tris/dithiothreitol (100 mm Tris, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min on ice. Cells were resuspended in Oxalyticase Buffer (50 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 1.4 m sorbitol, and 10 mm NaN3) containing Oxalyticase (1 μg/A600; Enzogenetics, Corvallis, OR) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with gentle mixing. The spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in cold Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m sorbitol, and 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each leupeptin, chymostatin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed using a glass Dounce homogenizer. The primary lysate was cleared twice of cell debris by centrifugation (500 × g, 10 min) and fractionated into supernatant and particulate fractions by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min). The fractions were adjusted to 1 mg/ml with Lysis Buffer and stored at –80 °C as aliquots. To assess the effect of chaotropic agents on the association of IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p with the yeast particulate fraction, freshly prepared samples of the particulate fraction were exposed to either 1 m NaCl, 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5), 1% SDS, or buffer alone for 10 min on ice, and the samples were subjected to centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min). Equivalent portions of each supernatant and particulate fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot as described above. Insulin Degradation Assay—Insulin degradation assays were carried out essentially as described previously but using yeast-derived lysates as the source of enzyme activity (4Farris W. Mansourian S. Chang Y. Lindsley L. Eckman E.A. Frosch M.P. Eckman C.B. Tanzi R.E. Selkoe D.J. Guenette S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4162-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). In brief, reactions were assembled to contain 0.5 mg/ml yeast lysate and 60 pm (∼10,000 cpm) of 125I-insulin (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) in 50 μl of Reaction Buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.2 m sorbitol, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated in the appropriate figure legend. Final sample preparation involved the addition of bovine serum albumin (1% final), trichloroacetic acid precipitation (10% final) for 10 min on ice, and centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C. The supernatant containing insulin fragments was transferred to a new tube, and the radioactivity associated with the supernatant and particulate fractions was determined using a Wallac γ-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Yeast Mating Assay—To evaluate the ability of plasmid-transformed MATaaxl1Δ ste23Δ strains to promote a-factor production, patch mating tests were performed using IH1793 (MATα lys1) and established methods (26Nijbroek G.L.

This test provides an indirect assessment of M16A enzyme function because a-factor production in the MATa cells is entirely dependent on the plasmid-encoded copy of the M16A enzyme. In brief, master plates were prepared by patching MATa yeast strains expressing Axl1p, Ste23p, or IDE onto YEPD agar plates. After 2–3 days of growth, the patches were replica-printed onto lawns of MATα cells (IH1793) spread on minimal media agar plates, and the replica-printed plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C. The MATα cell suspensions were prepared to approximately the same cell density in solutions of 1, 10, or 100% YEPD, which were prepared as mixtures of YEPD and the appropriate amount of sterile H2O. The trace amount of YEPD added to the minimal media allows for limited survival of the auxotrophic haploid cells, which is necessary for the mating process. Decreasing the YEPD amount shortens the survival window of the haploid cells and thus results in decreased mating efficiency. The diploid cells that result from mating events are prototrophic, and thus the growth of diploids in this test is indicative of mating and a functional M16A enzyme. Mass Spectroscopy—The a-factor mating pheromone produced by yeast expressing IDE, Ste23p, or Axl1p was purified according to published methods and analyzed by mass spectroscopy (26Nijbroek G.L. Michaelis S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, yeast were cultured in polypropylene culture tubes, and the a-factor secreted from the yeast cultures was recovered by washing the polypropylene culture tubes with methanol; secreted a-factor adsorbs to polypropylene and can be removed with organic solvents. The enriched a-factor samples were concentrated by speed-vac, desalted using Zip-tip C18 beads (Millipore), washed three times with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, eluted with 70% acetonitrile, and subjected to MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectroscopy using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix and a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). a-Factor Halo Assay—The total secreted a-factor produced by the saturated cultures of indicated strains was recovered as described above. The enriched samples were dried by a speed-vac and resuspended in 50 μl of MeOH. 2-Fold serial dilutions of the samples prepared in YEPD were spotted onto a lawn of RC757 (MATα sst2-1 his6 met1 can1 cyh2) or RC631 (MATasst2-1 his6 met1 can1 cyh2 rme ade2-1 ura1) cells; the latter served as a control for the unlikely possibility that a toxic product was being produced by the IDE-expressing strain (27Chan R.K. Otte C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The formation of a spot in the lawn is indicative of the presence of pheromone in the sample, and the relative potency of pheromone can be determined from the serial dilutions of the sample. The highest dilution having biological activity is referred to as the end point and is equivalent to a concentration of 12 pg/μl of a-factor (28Marcus S. Caldwell G.A. Miller D. Xue C.-B. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Invasive Growth Assay—The ability of haploid yeast cells to invade yeast agar was determined using a plate-washing assay (14Cullen P.J. Sprague Jr., G.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2990-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cell suspensions were spotted onto SC-ura plates, and the cells were grown for 4 days at 30 °C. The plates were washed under running H2O while gently rubbing the surface of the agar plate with a gloved finger. Agar plates were scanned prior to and immediately after washing. Budding Assay—Mid-log cells grown in selective liquid media were harvested to concentrate the cell suspension ∼2 times, and the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml Calcofluor (Sigma) for 5 min. The cells were washed twice with H2O, absorbed onto polylysine-coated glass slides, and viewed at ×100 with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with fluorescence optics. Fluorescent images were captured using a digital camera (Optronics, DEI-750). Bud scars on 100 cells were evaluated and categorized into three patterns: axial, bipolar, and random. The axial pattern was defined as bud scars located solely at one pole of the cell; the bipolar pattern had scars at both poles, and the random pattern displayed at least one bud scar in the region between both poles (8Fujita A.

(type I diabetes) is a T cell-mediated, autoimmune disease. The pathogenesis of IDDM involves the activation of autoimmune T cells followed by their homing into the pancreatic islets (1Homann D. von Herrath M. Clin. Immunol. 2004; 112: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the islets, T cells destroy insulin-producing β cells (2Mathis D. Vence L. Benoist C. Nature. 2001; 414: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The CD44 surface receptor is elevated in activated T cells and, via its interactions with endothelial hyaluronan, contributes to T cell adhesion on the endothelium and the subsequent transmigration events (3DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. Siegelman M.H. Science. 1997; 278: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP, a multifunctional membrane-tethered enzyme, functions in cancer cells as one of the main mediators of pericellular proteolytic events and directly cleaves cell receptors (4Egeblad M. Werb Z.

MT1-MMP cleavage releases the extracellular domain of CD44 from the cell surfaces and inactivates the functionality of the CD44 adhesion receptor. Evidence suggests that MT1-MMP proteolysis of CD44 significantly affects the adhesion and migration of malignant cells (6Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J.

In agreement with our hypothesis, we have determined here that pharmacological inhibition of T cell MT1-MMP enhances adhesion of the diabetogenic T cells to the pancreatic endothelium. Conversely, the enhanced adhesion of T cells significantly diminishes their subsequent homing into the pancreatic islets. Our results also imply that the inhibition of T cell MT1-MMP is key to the delay of the onset of diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a well-accepted rodent model of IDDM.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice and Cells—NOD mice of NOD/LtJ strain were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. IS-CD8+ T cells (insulin-specific, CD8-positive, Kd-restricted T cells of the TGNFC8 clone from the pancreas of NOD mouse) (11Wong F.S. Visintin I. Wen L. Flavell R.A. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) were maintained in Click's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 × 10-5m β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm penicillin-streptomycin, 3 mg/ml l-glutamine, and 5 units/ml recombinant murine interleukin-2 (12Savinov A.Y. Wong F.S. Stonebraker A.C. Chervonsky A.V. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Every 3 weeks IS-CD8+ cells were mixed with irradiated NOD splenocytes (2000 rads) loaded with the L15YLVCGERG23 insulin B chain peptide (10 μg/ml) (13Wong F.S. Karttunen J. Dumont C. Wen L. Visintin I. Pilip I.M. Shastri N. Pamer E.G. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The animal treatment protocols have been reviewed and approved by The Burnham Institute review committee.Induction of Diabetes in NOD Mice—IS-CD8+ cells were incubated both with and without AG3340 (50 μm or 21 μg/ml) for 2 h and then injected intravenously into the irradiated (725 rads, 24 h in advance), 5–8-week-old mice (1 × 107 cells/animal). Mice were monitored for 21 days. On days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 following the injection of the cells, mice received intraperitoneal injection with AG3340 (30 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline alone. The onset of diabetes was identified by assessing urine glucose levels with Diastix strips. Mice with urine glucose levels of >2000 mg/dl for 3 consecutive days were considered diabetic. AG3340 (molecular mass = 421 Da) was a kind gift of Dr. Peter Baciu (Allergan, Irvine, CA). According to numerous publications (e.g. Ref. 14Traisman H.S. Greenwood R.D. Clin. Pediatr. (Phila.). 1973; 12: 357-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the level of glucose in the urine closely follows that in the blood. The measurement of glucose in urine is a widely accepted method to follow the development of diabetes in NOD mice (15Pomerleau D.P. Bagley R.J. Serreze D.V. Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1603-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Fluorescent Tracing and Morphometric Analysis—For trafficking studies, IS-CD8+ T cells were incubated at 1 × 107 cells/ml for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark in complete Click's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 0.0075 mg/ml of the fluorescent dye 1,1′-didodecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI; Molecular Probes). After incubation, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess DiI. Labeled IS-CD8+ cells (1 × 107 cells) were injected intravenously in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline into irradiated (725 rads, 24 h in advance) NOD mice. Mice were sacrificed 24 h after injection of DiI-labeled cells. The spleen and the pancreata were excised and fixed in 0.1 m periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer. The organs were next sucrose-saturated, freeze-molded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek Inc.), and freeze-sectioned. 7-μm-thick cryostat sections of the entire pancreas were prepared at 60-μm intervals using a Leica CM1900 cryotom. Distribution of DiI-labeled CD8+ cells within the islets was examined using a fluorescent microscope. At least 100 individual islets per mouse (4Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5077) Google Scholar, 5Sabeh F. Ota I. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Soloway P. Balbin M. Lopez-Otin C. Shapiro S. Inada M. Krane S. Allen E. Chung D. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar mice/experimental group) were examined. The characteristic morphology of the islets is easily identified on the cryosections. DiI-labeled cells were counted within the area relevant to each individual islet (see Fig. 3 for a representative image; the islet-relevant area is depicted by the solid white line, and the islet boundaries are shown by the white dotted line). The position of each IS-CD8+ labeled cell was determined relative to the islet boundary. The labeled cells localized within the islet boundary were considered to be “inside,” whereas the labeled cells adjacent to the islet but outside of the islet boundary were considered to be “at the entrance.” This method was described in substantial detail in our prior work (12Savinov A.Y.

Where indicated, GM6001 (50 μm; Chemicon) was added to the samples. Following treatment, the cells were injected into the irradiated mice or used for DiI labeling, Western blotting, FACS analysis, and other analytical procedures (12Savinov A.Y. Wong F.S.

Following washes to remove biotin, cells were co-incubated for 2 h with MT1-MMP-CAT in serum-free, unsupplemented Click's medium. The cells were then lysed with 50 mmN-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin (1 μg/ml each). Biotin-labeled CD44 was captured from the cell lysate and from the medium aliquots on streptavidin-agarose beads. The captured samples were examined by Western blotting with the CD44 (clone IM7.8.1) antibody to determine the released, soluble, CD44 ectodomain in the medium samples and the residual, membrane-anchored, cellular CD44 in the cell lysates.MT1-MMP-dependent MMP-2 Activation and Gelatin Zymography— IS-CD8+ cells (1 × 106) were either allowed to adhere for 4 h in serum-free unsupplemented Click's medium to plastic coated with 2% gelatin or kept in solution. Under these experimental conditions, the vast majority of cells became attached to gelatin. In 4 h, media samples (30 μl each) were withdrawn and analyzed by gelatin zymography (17Deryugina E.I.

Where indicated, cells were supplemented with external purified pro-MMP-2 (20 ng). Pro-MMP-2 was isolated from a conditioned medium of p2AHT2A72 cells derived from an HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line sequentially transfected with the E1A and MMP-2 cDNAs (19Strongin A.Y. Collier I.

To determine the levels of CD44, IS-CD8+ cells were also stained with soluble fluorescently-labeled hyaluronan (Sigma). IS-C8+ cells were counterstained with phycoerythrin or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD8 antibody (Sigma).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMT1-MMP Sheds Cellular CD44—We determined that MT1-MMP proteolysis of T cell CD44 regulates adhesion and subsequent transmigration and homing of T cells into the pancreas.FACS analyses with MT1-MMP and CD44 antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled hyaluronan demonstrated the presence of high levels of cell surface-associated MT1-MMP and CD44 in IS-CD8+ cells in suspension (Fig. 1A). IS-CD8+ cells recognize an insulin B chain-derived L15YLVCGERG23 peptide in the context of the Kd major histocompatibility complex class I molecule (13Wong F.S. Karttunen J. Dumont C. Wen L. Visintin I. Pilip I.M. Shastri N. Pamer E.G. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Injection of IS-CD8+ cells induces diabetes in sub-lethally irradiated NOD/LtJ mice in 1 week (12Savinov A.Y. Wong F.S. Stonebraker A.C. Chervonsky A.V. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). NOD mice are widely used as the best animal model of IDDM (20Delovitch T.L. Singh B. Immunity. 1997; 7: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Because the Ab815 antibody against MT1-MMP recognizes the hinge domain of the protease, FACS tests do not distinguish the pro-enzyme, the activated enzyme forms, and the inert complexes of MT1-MMP with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2.Fig. 1Excessive MT1-MMP proteolysis of CD44 decreases the rate of islet homing of T cells and delays the onset of diabetes in mice.A, FACS analyses of IS-CD8+ cells. IS-CD8+ cells were stained with the MT1-MMP and CD44 antibodies, followed by the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody, and then subjected to FACS analyses. Similar results were obtained when CD44 was stained with soluble fluorescently labeled hyaluronan (data not shown). Left panel, staining of MT1-MMP (bold line, MT1-MMP; dotted line, isotype control). Right panel, staining of CD44 (bold line, untreated cells; dotted line, cells co-incubated with MT1-MMP-CAT). B, MT1-MMP sheds cellular CD44 and releases its soluble fragments into the medium. IS-CD8+ cells were surface biotinylated and then co-incubated with MT1-MMP-CAT (26Ratnikov B. Deryugina E. Leng J. Marchenko G. Dembrow D. Strongin A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cells were then lysed with N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture. Biotin-labeled CD44 was captured from the cell lysate, and the captured samples were examined by Western blotting with the CD44 antibody to determine the released, soluble, CD44 ectodomain (Medium) and the residual, membrane-anchored CD44 (Cells). Where indicated, GM6001 was added to the samples. C, MT1-MMP proteolysis of CD44 reduces diabetogenicity of IS-CD8+ cells. Left panel, cells were co-incubated with MT1-MMP-CAT, labeled with a fluorescent DiI dye, and then injected into NOD mice. In 24 h, the number of the labeled cells within the islets was counted in the cryostat sections of the pancreas. Right panel, MT1-MMP-CAT-treated and untreated IS-CD8+ cells were injected into NOD mice. The incidence of diabetes was 100% (6 of 6) with untreated cells and 70% (7 of 10) with the cells co-incubated with MT1-MMP-CAT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The levels of CD44 were significantly reduced in the majority of IS-CD8+ cells co-incubated with the external, purified, catalytically potent MT1-MMP-CAT (Fig. 1A). This treatment did not affect the levels of other T cell receptors including CD3, CD8, CD29, and CD49 or the viability of T cells (data not shown). To support these observations, we also surface-labeled IS-CD8+ cells with membrane-impermeable biotin and then co-incubated them with MT1-MMP-CAT. The liberated, soluble CD44 fragments were next captured on streptavidin-agarose beads and detected by Western blotting. These studies confirmed that during co-incubation of MT1-MMP-CAT with IS-CD8+ cells, the limited quantities of MT1-MMP-CAT released significant amounts of the digest fragments of cellular CD44 and reduced the residual levels of cell surface-associated CD44. These data correlate well with the results of the FACS analyses shown in Fig. 1A. Consistent with the role of MT1-MMP in the cleavage of CD44, GM6001 (a potent hydroxamate inhibitor of MT1-MMP) reversed the effect of MT1-MMP-CAT (Fig. 1B).IS-CD8+ cells co-incubated with MT1-MMP-CAT were also labeled with a fluorescent DiI dye and then injected into irradiated NOD mice. In 24 h, labeled cells were counted in the pancreatic islets. MT1-MMP proteolysis of CD44 caused an ∼4.5-fold decrease in cell homing and almost a 2-fold delay of the onset of diabetes in mice (Fig. 1C). These results suggested that cleavage of T cell CD44 by the external MT1-MMP-CAT decreased the number of the IS-CD8+ cells that were capable of adhering to hyaluronan of the pancreatic endothelium. Consequently, following co-incubation with MT1-MMP-CAT, the number of transmigrating cells was also low.MT1-MMP Is Activated in Adherent IS-CD8+Cells—Endogenous MT1-MMP is latent in non-adherent IS-CD8+ cells, whereas adhesion of IS-CD8+ cells induces the activation of MT1-MMP, the cleavage of CD44, and the stimulation of T cell transmigration. Thus, IS-CD8+ cells were capable of activating MMP-2, the enzyme known to be directly activated by MT1-MMP, only after their adhesion to gelatin (Fig. 2). Non-adherent cells did not activate MMP-2. In agreement, release of the CD44 proteolytic fragments into medium was detected only in adherent IS-CD8+ cells. CD44 remained intact in non-adherent cells. GM6001 blocked both the activation of MMP-2 and the shedding of CD44 in adherent cells (Fig. 2). These results suggest that MT1-MMP proteolysis of CD44 is induced only following adhesion of the diabetogenic cells to the substratum. It is likely that, following adhesion, activated MT1-MMP cleaves CD44, and this event promotes the liberation of T cells, which is followed by the transmigration of T cells through the endothelium and their homing into the pancreatic islets. Conversely, we suggest that inhibition of MT1-MMP enhances the adhesion of T cells and represses their transmigration efficiency.Fig. 2Proteolytically active MT1-MMP activates MMP-2 and cleaves cellular CD44 in adherent IS-CD8+ cells. IS-CD8+ cells were either allowed to adhere to plastic coated with gelatin or kept in solution. Top panel, cells adherent to gelatin-coated plastic (A) and non-adherent cells in suspension (NA) were co-incubated with purified MMP-2 (MMP-2 alone; no cells). In 4 h, media samples were withdrawn and analyzed by gelatin zymography to identify the proteolytic activity and the activation status of MMP-2. To observe the activation of MMP-2 naturally synthesized by T cells, no external MMP-2 was added to the two samples on the left. P, I, and E, the 68-kDa pro-enzyme, the 64-kDa intermediate, and the active 62-kDa mature enzyme of MMP-2. Bottom panel, cells were either surface-biotinylated and allowed to adhere to gelatin or kept in suspension. Cell lysate and medium aliquots were captured with streptavidin-agarose beads. CD44 was analyzed in the captured samples by Western blotting with a CD44 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of MT1-MMP Represses the Diabetogenicity of IS-CD8+Cells—To confirm the role of MT1-MMP in T cell transmigration, homing, and diabetogenesis, we used another potent hydroxamate inhibitor, AG3340 (21Shalinsky D.R. Brekken J. Zou H. McDermott C.D. Forsyth P. Edwards D. Margosiak S. Bender S. Truitt G. Wood A. Varki N.M. Appelt K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 236-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). AG3340 inhibits MT1-MMP with a Ki in a sub-nanomolar range. AG3340 was used in cancer Phase I–III clinical trials (22Hande K.R. Collier M. Paradiso L. Stuart-Smith J. Dixon M. Clendeninn N. Yeun G. Alberti D. Binger K. Wilding G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To evaluate AG3340, we used both IS-CD8+ cells and the splenocytes isolated from newly diabetic NOD mice (12Savinov A.Y. Wong F.S. Stonebraker A.C. Chervonsky A.V. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The cells were co-incubated with AG3340 or left untreated and then injected in NOD mice, which then received AG3340 (30 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg) or solvent alone (control). AG3340 at a concentration as low as 1 mg/kg delayed the onset of diabetes ∼2-fold compared with the control (Fig. 3A). These data are consistent with earlier work showing that inhibiting CD44 with neutralizing antibodies protects NOD mice from IDDM (23Weiss L. Slavin S. Reich S. Cohen P. Shuster S. Stern R. Kaganovsky E. Okon E. Rubinstein A.M. Naor D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).In agreement, AG3340, by increasing the number of IS-CD8+ cells that remained firmly adhered to the hyaluronan of the pancreatic endothelium, significantly delayed the process of T cell entry into the pancreatic islets. IS-CD8+ cells co-incubated with AG3340 and labeled with DiI were injected into NOD mice. In 24 h, labeled IS-CD8+ cells were counted both at the periphery and inside the islets (Fig. 3, B and C). In the presence of AG3340, T cells were detected at the islet entrance, and a smaller number of cells were found inside the islets. In the absence of AG3340, the situation was reversed, and T cells efficiently transmigrated into the islets. Our findings suggest that inhibition of T cell MT1-MMP is key to delaying the onset of diabetes in a well-accepted model of IDDM in rodents. The putative mechanism by which MT1-MMP proteolysis of CD44 regulates diapedesis is explained in Fig. 3D.Interestingly, injection of the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor KB-R7785 at 100 mg/kg twice daily (i.e. 200 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks resulted in a significant decrease in plasma glucose levels in a rodent model of type II diabetes in KKAy mice. The proposed mechanism and the target proteins were, however, distinct from those determined in our model of type I diabetes (24Morimoto Y. Nishikawa K. Ohashi M. Life Sci. 1997; 61: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, the dosages of the inhibitors used in our work were ∼100-fold lower. Additional studies that suggested the importance of MMP action in diabetes complications including cataract development, proteinuria, and periodontitis were reported by Ryan et al. (25Ryan M.E. Ramamurthy N.S. Sorsa T. Golub L.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Overall, these earlier works and our studies imply that the broad spectrum MMP inhibitors may be used to control diabetes by targeting MT1-MMP and probably also disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)-like proteases (8Nakamura H. Suenaga N. Taniwaki K. Matsuki H. Yonezawa K. Fujii M. Okada Y. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).We conclude that pharmacological inhibition of easily accessible, T cell surface-associated MT1-MMP by low dosages of the readily available anticancer hydroxamate class drugs will reduce transmigration of cytotoxic T cells into the pancreatic islets. We believe that our results have the potential for therapeutic translation and need further testing (which is in progress) in a spontaneous animal model of IDDM. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) 1The abbreviations used are: IDDM, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; DiI, 1,1′-didodecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1-MMP, membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase; MT1-MMP-CAT, the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP; NOD, non-obese diabetic; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell-sorting. 1The abbreviations used are: IDDM, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; DiI, 1,1′-didodecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1-MMP, membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase; MT1-MMP-CAT, the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP; NOD, non-obese diabetic; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell-sorting. (type I diabetes) is a T cell-mediated, autoimmune disease. The pathogenesis of IDDM involves the activation of autoimmune T cells followed by their homing into the pancreatic islets (1Homann D. von Herrath M. Clin. Immunol. 2004; 112: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the islets, T cells destroy insulin-producing β cells (2Mathis D. Vence L. Benoist C. Nature. 2001; 414: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The CD44 surface receptor is elevated in activated T cells and, via its interactions with endothelial hyaluronan, contributes to T cell adhesion on the endothelium and the subsequent transmigration events (3DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. Siegelman M.H. Science. 1997; 278: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP, a multifunctional membrane-tethered enzyme, functions in cancer cells as one of the main mediators of pericellular proteolytic events and directly cleaves cell receptors (4Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5077) Google Scholar, 5Sabeh F. Ota I. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Soloway P. Balbin M. Lopez-Otin C. Shapiro S. Inada M. Krane S. Allen E. Chung D. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). CD44, a major hyaluronan receptor, is a well-established target of MT1-MMP in tumor cells (6Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 7Mori H. Tomari T. Koshikawa N. Kajita M. Itoh Y. Sato H. Tojo H. Yana I. Seiki M.

MT1-MMP cleavage releases the extracellular domain of CD44 from the cell surfaces and inactivates the functionality of the CD44 adhesion receptor. Evidence suggests that MT1-MMP proteolysis of CD44 significantly affects the adhesion and migration of malignant cells (6Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 9Suenaga N. Mori H. Itoh Y. Seiki M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, we hypothesized that MT1-MMP also targets CD44 in T cells and that these proteolytic events regulate transmigration of the diabetogenic T cells into the pancreatic islets. In agreement with our hypothesis, we have determined here that pharmacological inhibition of T cell MT1-MMP enhances adhesion of the diabetogenic T cells to the pancreatic endothelium. Conversely, the enhanced adhesion of T cells significantly diminishes"

That enzyme catalyzes the formation of riboflavin with the same regiochemistry as the riboflavin synthases of eubacteria and eukaryotes described above (i.e. an antiparallel arrangement of the substrate molecules in the activated complex). The riboflavin synthases of Archaea show sequence similarity with the penultimate enzyme of the riboflavin pathway, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase, which catalyzes the condensation of 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione with 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate under release of inorganic phosphate (34.Volk R.

Isolation of the Pentacyclic Intermediate of E. coli Riboflavin Synthase (Compound Q)—The isolation procedure for the pentacyclic intermediate of E. coli riboflavin synthase has been described previously (30.Illarionov B.

Isolation of the Pentacyclic Intermediate of M. jannaschii Riboflavin Synthase (Compound Q′), Steady-state Kinetic Measurements, Analytical Reverse Phase High Pressure Liquid Chromatography, CD Spectroscopy, NMR Spectroscopy, and Computer Modeling—The detailed procedures are described in the on-line supplemental data. Riboflavin synthases are inherently slow catalysts. The enzymes from E. coli and M. jannaschii catalyze the formation of product at rates of 5.3 and 0.16 molecules per minute and per subunit, respectively, at 25 °C (24.Illarionov B. Kemter K. Eberhardt S. Richter G. Cushman M. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11524-11530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33.Fischer M. Schott A.-K. Römisch W. Ramsperger A. Augustin M. Fidler A. Bacher A. Richter G. Huber R. Eisenreich W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). That slow rate makes it possible to perform acid quenched single turnover experiments with relatively large reaction mixture volumes. In that way, the pentacyclic intermediate of riboflavin synthase of E. coli was obtained earlier by quenching a reaction mixture containing the S41A mutant of riboflavin synthase and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (at a ratio of 2 substrate equivalents/subunit) with trifluoroacetic acid (30.Illarionov B. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7224-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). At room temperature, the M. jannaschii enzyme operates at an even slower rate than the E. coli enzyme, and it is therefore easily accessible to the same experimental approach. Specifically, a mixture containing 2.8 mm 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine and 0.3 mm (per enzyme pentamer) M. jannaschii wild type riboflavin synthase was incubated for 45 s. Trichloroacetic acid was then added rapidly, with stirring to a final concentration of 0.15 m. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the mixture was subjected to chromatographic separation affording 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, riboflavin, and a compound subsequently designated Q′, whose optical spectrum closely resembled that of the pentacyclic intermediate of E. coli riboflavin synthase, Compound Q (Fig. 2). The isolated Compound Q′ was converted to riboflavin at a rate of 21 nmol mg-1 min-1 by riboflavin synthase of M. jannaschii under steady-state conditions, whereas 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine was converted to riboflavin at a rate of 11 nmol mg-1 min-1. Hence, Q′ fulfills the criteria for a kinetically competent intermediate. The partitioning factor for enzyme-catalyzed formation of riboflavin and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine from Compound Q′ was determined to be more than 2000:1, i.e. practically all Q′ used in this experiment was converted to riboflavin. This contrasts with earlier observation of the E. coli riboflavin synthase in which the transformation of Compound Q into riboflavin and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine proceeds with a partitioning factor of 5:1 (30.Illarionov B. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7224-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When Compound Q (i.e. the putative intermediate of the E. coli enzyme) was tested as a substrate for M. jannaschii riboflavin synthase, the rates of formation for riboflavin and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine were below the limit of detection (<10 pmol mg-1 min-1). Similarly, when Compound Q′ was tested as substrate for riboflavin synthase of E. coli, the rates of formation for riboflavin and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine were <10 pmol mg-1 min-1. Retention volumes for Q and Q′ on an RP18 column were identical. Absorption spectra of Compound Q generated by the E. coli enzyme and of the novel Compound Q′ generated by the M. jannaschii enzyme are similar under acidic as well as alkaline conditions (Fig. 2, A and B). On the other hand, circular dichroism revealed similar envelopes but opposite signs (Fig. 3). Fig. 4B shows 13C NMR signals of a sample of Compound Q′ prepared from [U-13C13]6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine. The multiplicity of 13C signals suggests a dimer formed from 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, in parallel to our earlier studies with Compound Q, the intermediate of E. coli riboflavin synthase. With the exception of two signals (C-2 and C-2*), which appear as singlets, all 13C signals appear as multiplets due to 13C13C coupling. Information on carbon/carbon connectivity was obtained from the 13C13C coupling pattern and from a two-dimensional 13C13C homocorrelation experiment (INADEQUATE), which identified 10 directly linked 13C pairs (Table I). Two spin systems each comprising five 13C atoms in the range of 45–75 ppm represent two topologically non-equivalent d-ribityl side chains. Their signals all appear as multiplets due to 13C13C coupling. The line widths are relatively narrow, in the range of 20–40 Hz.Table INMR data of [U-13C26]Compound Q′ d, doublet signal; t, triplet signal.PositionChemical shift (δ13C)Line width (V1/2)Coupling constant (Jcc)Correlation pattern (INADEQUATE)7α*18.41606α*20.51506*7α34.51506α36.51401′*47.02341 (d)2′*1′50.21737 (d)2′6*56.5906α*7*59.8905′, 5′*62.74040 (d)4′*, 4′2′68.72040 (t)2′*, 3′*, 4′*, 4′72.9 to 70.91′*, 1′, 5′, 5′*3′73.62042 (t)4a*87.4704a134.61508a6137.11507144.91208a*146.64082 (d)8a150.8854a2*150.8102157.7104*160.32585 (d)4162.22076 (d) Open table in a new tab The line widths of the 13C signals of the heterocyclic moiety vary over a much wider range of 10–160 Hz. Unusual line broadening of certain signals had also been observed previously with Compound Q, the reaction intermediate of E. coli riboflavin synthase (30.Illarionov B. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7224-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Connectivities for about one-half of the carbon atoms of Compound Q′ could be established directly by INADEQUATE spectroscopy of the universally 13C-labeled samples (see above). However, certain carbon atoms escaped detection in the INADEQUATE spectrum due to their increased line widths. To unequivocally assign all 13C NMR signals, we prepared Compound Q′ from a mixture of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine isotopologs obtained by fermentation with [3-13C]glucose as carbon source (43.Illarionov B. Fischer M. Lee C.Y. Bacher A. Eisenreich W. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 5588-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). That mixture predominantly contained the [2′-13C]-, [3′-13C]-, [6-13C]-, [8a-13C]-, [7-13C]-, and [4-13C]-labeled isotopologs of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine; 13C enrichments of these species were shown previously (43.Illarionov B. Fischer M. Lee C.Y. Bacher A. Eisenreich W. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 5588-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to vary between 20% and 70% 13C. Naturally, the amplitudes of the Compound Q′ sample derived from that isotopolog mixture must reflect the different 13C abundance in different carbon positions (Table II). This amplitude variation can be used to trace individual carbon atoms in Compound Q′ to the atoms in 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine from which they were derived. Two sections of the 13C NMR spectrum of Q′ obtained from this library of selectively 13C enriched 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazines are shown in Fig. 4A. The signal integrals are given below the respective signals. The relative 13C enrichments of the sample whose spectrum is shown in Fig. 4A were calculated from the ratios of the integrals in Fig. 4, A and B. Taking the absolute 13C enrichments at C-6 of 6,7-dimetyl-8-ribityllumazine as a reference value (73%), the relative enrichments of Q′ at different carbon atoms were normalized (observed enrichments in Table II). The observed values are in almost perfect agreement with the predicted ones and establish the basis for the signal assignments shown in Figs. 4 and 5 and Table I.Table II13C pattern of Compound Q′ synthesized from an isotopolog mixture of 13C-labeled 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine Values larger than 15% are shown in bold.Position13C EnrichmentPredictedObserved%%7α*1<56α*5<57α1<56α5<51′*661′656*7373aUsed as the reference value7*32325′, 5′*112'62572′*, 3′*, 4′*, 4′, 3′23174a*4<54a4<567373aUsed as the reference value732NDbND, not determined8a*43ND8a43ND2*1<521<54*312243118a Used as the reference valueb ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Based on these data, we conclude that Compounds Q and Q′ have the same constitution but diastereomeric configurations. This implies that the two lumazine substrates at the respective active sites of the E. coli and the M. jannaschii enzyme must be arranged with different topologies relative to each other. The terminal enzyme reaction in the biosynthesis of riboflavin has a surprisingly large number of unique features. (i) The substrate, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, has an extremely acidic methyl group with a pK around 9, and the facile formation of the cognate lumazine anion is believed to represent an early step in the biosynthesis of vitamin B2 (28.Plaut G.W. Beach R.L. Singer T.P. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier, Amsterdam1976: 737-746Google Scholar). (ii) In a formal sense, the conversion of the lumazine derivative 1 into riboflavin under formation of a benzenoid ring is a dismutation. However, the reaction is set apart from typical dismutations by the sheer size of the exchanged module, a C4H6 fragment, whereas typical dismutations involve the exchange of hydride ions. (iii) The trajectory of the reaction under study must proceed via a complex series of transition states and reaction intermediates, but despite that mechanistic complexity, the reaction can proceed without catalysis even under mild conditions (neutral aqueous solution). (iv) Two different riboflavin synthase types have evolved independently, and these enzyme classes are not only entirely different with respect to their amino acid sequences but also differ with respect to the inherent symmetry properties of their respective active sites (for details, see below). Earlier work with E. coli riboflavin synthase identified a pentacyclic intermediate that can be formally described as an adduct of two identical substrate molecules and affords riboflavin by molecular fragmentation. In the present study, we isolated a putative intermediate of the reaction catalyzed by an archaeal riboflavin synthase that has the same constitution as the pentacyclic eubacterial intermediate but different stereochemical features. Each of the two different pentacyclic intermediates of eubacterial and archaeal origin is metabolized exclusively by the respective enzyme by which it can be formed. To discuss in more depth the stereochemical properties of the pentacyclic intermediates, it must be noted that each of the two 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine molecules that serve as substrate for the formation of riboflavin has three chiral centers, i.e. the 2′, 3′, and 4′ carbon atoms of the ribityl side chain. Hence, the pentacyclic intermediates have a total of six chiral centers located to their ribityl side chains. Moreover, the adduct formation involves the formation of two additional chiral carbons (carbons 6* and 7*) that bridge the two lumazine moieties. The stereochemical features of the pentacyclic intermediate of E. coli have been derived previously by a comparison between the x-ray structures of the riboflavin synthases of E. coli and S. pombe (16.Gerhardt S. Schott A.-K. Kairies N. Cushman M. Illarionov B. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Fischer M. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1371-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The structures of both domains of the yeast enzyme in complex with a bound intermediate analog were determined by x-ray crystallography (16.Gerhardt S. Schott A.-K. Kairies N. Cushman M. Illarionov B. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Fischer M. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1371-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, because the conditions used for crystal growth were conducive to the dissociation of the trimeric protein into monomers, no active site capable of adduct formation was present in the crystals. On the other hand, the E. coli protein had been crystallized as a homotrimer, but without a bound ligand (17.Liao D.I. Calabrese J.C. Wawrzak Z. Viitanen P.V. Jordan D.B. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By homology modeling of the ligands bound to the yeast enzyme into the E. coli structure, it became apparent that a single active site is formed in the E. coli crystal structure by the close apposition of an N-terminal domain of one subunit with the C-terminal domain of a second subunit. In that complex, the two substrate molecules are in close contact and form a quasi-c2-symmetric pair that is located in a pseudo-c2-symmetric environment formed by the apposition of the two domains described. Based on this unique topology, we proposed a cis linkage between the donor and acceptor pteridine systems in the pentacyclic intermediate of E. coli. Notably, a trans linkage was later proposed by other authors on the basis of computer modeling studies (31.Zheng Y.-J. Jordan D.B. Liao D.-I. Bioorg. Chem. 2003; 31: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, that hypothesis is at odds with the experimental data reported in our earlier study. Based on the comparison of the CD and NMR data of Compounds Q and Q′, we propose that both molecular species share (i) the same constitution, (ii) the same stereochemistry of their ribityl side chains (which is of course not affected in the course of the riboflavin synthase-catalyzed reaction), and (iii) the cis linkage of the two pteridine systems, but that the pentacyclic ring systems of the two compounds are related by mirror symmetry. Both compounds have eight chiral centers (the ring carbon atoms 6* and 7* and the chiral centers of each respective ribityl side chain). Because the chiral centers of both ribityl side chains have the same configuration, Compounds Q and Q′ differ by their configurations at the ring carbon atoms 6* and 7* and must be designated as diastereomers (Fig. 6). This is very well in line with the CD spectra. The chromophores of both compounds under study are inherently asymmetric due to the impact of the chiral ring atoms 6* and 7*, and the CD spectra should predominantly reflect the influence of these chiral centers. However, due to the additional influence of chiral centers, the CD spectra can be expected to differ in the details of the spectral envelopes, not just with respect to the signs, and this expectation is perfectly in line with the experimental findings. Based on previous mechanistic hypotheses (7.Beach R.L. Plaut G.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1969; 6: 3489-3492Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9.Paterson T. Wood H.C.S. J. Chem. Soc. Chem.

Elsevier, Amsterdam1976: 737-746Google Scholar), the stereochemical features of hypothetical reaction intermediates in the trajectories of the two enzyme types are summarized in Fig. 6. Amino acid sequence arguments indicate that riboflavin synthases have developed independently in Archaea on one side and in eubacteria and eukaryotes (plants and fungi) on the other side (33.Fischer M. Schott A.-K. Römisch W. Ramsperger A. Augustin M. Fidler A. Bacher A. Richter G. Huber R. Eisenreich W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Specifically, completely sequenced archaeal genomes comprise sets of two similar genes, which specify paralogous riboflavin synthases and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthases. On the other hand, in eubacteria, plants, and fungi, single genes of the 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthases type are accompanied by genes specifying riboflavin synthases of the eubacterial/eukaryotic type characterized by internal sequence similarity and without similarity with 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase. Sequence arguments also showed that the divergence between the two domains of eubacteria/eukaryotic riboflavin synthase occurred very early in evolution; similarly, the divergence between 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase and archaebacterial riboflavin synthase occurred early in evolution (33.Fischer M. Schott A.-K. Römisch W. Ramsperger A. Augustin M. Fidler A. Bacher A. Richter G. Huber R. Eisenreich W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The structure and mechanism of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase has been studied in considerable detail. For example, the enzymes from S. cerevisiae (41.Meining W. Mortl S. Fischer M. Cushman M. Bacher A. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), S. pombe (44.Gerhardt S. Haase I. Steinbacher S. Kaiser J.T. Cushman M. Bacher A.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2355-2365PubMed Google Scholar) are homopentamers; the enzymes of B. subtilis (46.Schott K. Ladenstein R. Konig A. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12686-12689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), M. jannaschii (47.Haase I. Mortl S. Kohler P. Bacher A. Fischer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and E. coli (48.Mörtl S. Fischer M. Richter G. Tack J. Weinkauf S. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33201-33207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) form icosahedral capsids, which are best described as dodecamers of pentamers. Each of the topologically equivalent active sites is located at the interface between two adjacent subunits in a pentamer. Hydrodynamic measurements show that riboflavin synthase of M. jannaschii is a homopentamer (33.Fischer M. Schott A.-K. Römisch W. Ramsperger A. Augustin M. Fidler A. Bacher A. Richter G. Huber R. Eisenreich W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is therefore virtually certain that the enzyme also shares the 5-fold rotational symmetry that is a common feature of all known lumazine synthases (because even the icosahedral lumazine synthases are best described as dodecamers of pentamers). The active sites of lumazine synthases are invariably located at the interfaces between adjacent subunits in the pentameric modules, and it is likely that the active sites of archaebacterial riboflavin synthases have the same approximate location. The orientation of the product, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine in the enzyme-product complex of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase is well documented by x-ray structures (44.Gerhardt S. Haase I. Steinbacher S. Kaiser J.T. Cushman M. Bacher A. Huber R. Fischer M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1317-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 49.Zhang X. Meining W. Haase I. Fischer M. Bacher A. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The heterocyclic ring system of the product has been shown to form a π complex with an aromatic amino acid residue (phenylalanine or tryptophan). It is highly plausible that one of the substrate molecules in the paralogous riboflavin synthase could occupy the same place as the product lumazine molecule in 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase. It is also likely that a second molecule of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine must be embedded in the spacious active site cavity with the ribityl side chains of the two substrate molecules pointing into opposite directions, i.e. in a quasi-c2-symmetrical arrangement. However, whereas the pseudo-c2-symmetry of the respective N-terminal and C-terminal domains that together form the active site of the E. coli enzyme is by necessity conducive to the required quasi-c2-topology of the substrate molecules, the archaeal enzyme is devoid of any symmetry properties that would inherently enforce the required symmetry properties of the substrate topology. We are not aware of any precedent in which a given reaction occurs via stereochemically different intermediates under the catalytic influence of structurally unrelated enzymes. More importantly, however, the data are relevant in terms of the evolution of the flavin biosynthetic pathway, which affords one of the central catalysts of all organisms. The evolution of a riboflavin synthase would be expected to depend to a significant degree on the availability of the substrate, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine. Hence, it appears plausible that the evolution of lumazine synthase, in the case of Archaea, should not have been preceded by the evolution of the paralog enzyme, riboflavin synthase. The pathway intermediate, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, differs structurally from the flavocoenzymes by the absence of the benzenoid ring. Despite that, the redox properties of 8-substituted pteridines and 10-substituted isoalloxazine-type flavocoenzymes are similar (50.Harders H. Forster S. Voelter W. Bacher A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3360-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that lumazine-type coenzymes could have preceded present day flavocoenzymes. In that context, it is notable that 8-substituted lumazines function as cofactors of certain luminescent proteins such as lumazine protein and blue fluorescent protein in certain luminescent bacteria that are believed to serve as optical transponders (51.Lee J. Matheson I.B.C. Müller F. O'Kane D.J. Vervoort J. Visser A.J.W.G. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 109-151Google Scholar, 52.Petushkov V.N. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Notably, however, these proteins appear not to be involved in any redox biochemistry and may in fact be entirely devoid of catalytic activity. Download .pdf (.07 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2087437136,"The single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding protein LEF-3 of <i>Autographa californica</i> multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus promoted Mg<sup>2+</sup>-independent unwinding of DNA duplexes and annealing of complementary DNA strands. The unwinding and annealing activities of LEF-3 appeared to act in a competitive manner and were determined by the ratio of protein to DNA. At subsaturating and saturating concentrations, LEF-3 promoted annealing, whereas it promoted unwinding at oversaturation of DNA substrates. The LEF-3 binding to ssDNA and unwinding activity were sensitive to redox agents and were inhibited by oxidation of thiol groups in LEF-3 with 1,1′-azobis(<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethylformamide) (diamide) or by modification with the thiol-conjugating agent <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide. Both oxidation and alkylation increased the dissociation constant of the interaction with model oligonucleotides indicating a decrease in an intrinsic affinity of LEF-3 for ssDNA. These results proved that free thiol groups are essential both for LEF-3 interaction with ssDNA and for DNA unwinding. In contrast, oxidation or modification of thiol groups stimulated the annealing activity of LEF-3 partially due to suppression of its unwinding activity. Treatment of LEF-3 with the reducing agent dithiothreitol inhibited annealing, indicating association of this activity with the oxidized protein. Thus, the balance between annealing and unwinding activities of LEF-3 was determined by the redox state of protein with the oxidized state favoring annealing and the reduced state favoring unwinding. An LEF-3 mutant in which the conservative cysteine Cys<sup>214</sup> was replaced with serine showed both a decreased binding to DNA and a reduced unwinding activity, thus indicating that this residue might participate in the regulation of LEF-3 activities."

The combined biochemical and biological data available from mutagenesis studies lend strong support to the proposed functions of these protein motifs.Information gleaned from such studies has accrued almost exclusively from analysis of retroviral enzymes, in particular those of human, avian, and murine origin. In contrast, there is a paucity of detailed biochemical information on equivalent events mediated by RT from long terminal repeat (LTR)-containing retrotransposons such as Ty1 and Ty3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Ty5 of Saccharomyces paradoxus. Such an analysis is particularly important in view of differences at several steps of the LTR-containing retrotransposon reverse transcription cycle. Examples of such differences include (a) initiation of (-)-strand DNA synthesis from an internal site of the cognate tRNA primer in Ty5 (21Ke N. Gao X. Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Voytas D.F. RNA (N.

Crystallographic analyses of HIV-1 RT have indicated that Gln258, Gly262, and Trp266 of this α-helix are in close contact with the sugar phosphate backbone of the primer, playing an important role in translocation and as a “sensor” of nucleic acid configuration (1Jacobo-Molina A.

Our data indicate that Gly294, Asn297, and Tyr298 of Ty3 RT may mediate the same role as their HIV RT counterparts (Gly262, Asn265, and Trp266, respectively). Alterations in template-primer usage were noted when Ty3 RT Phe292 (HIV-1 RT Leu260) was altered, whereas alanine substitution at the conserved Gln290 (HIV-1 RT Gln258) was tolerated with minimal alteration to DNA polymerase and RNase H functions. Collectively, our data provide the first comprehensive biochemical study of an important structural motif of the Ty3 RT DNA polymerase domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotides—Standard DNA oligonucleotides and those containing locked nucleic acid analogs or abasic lesions were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). RNA oligonucleotides for analysis of RNase H activity were purchased from Dharmacon (Boulder, CO).Preparation and Purification of Ty3 RT Mutants—Point mutations in the DNA polymerase domain of Ty3 RT expressed on plasmid p6HTy3RT (30Rausch J.W.

Briefly, sense and antisense mutagenic oligonucleotides were purchased for each point mutation and annealed to the denatured p6HTy3RT plasmid. Extension and incorporation of the mutagenic primers during temperature cycling were performed with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The reaction was treated with DpnI endonuclease to digest the parental DNA template and then transformed into Escherichia coli XL10-Gold ultracompetent cells. Ty3 RT mutants were purified by a combination of metal chelate and size exclusion chromatography according to Lener et al. (31Lener D. Budihas S.R. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26486-26495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and stored in a 50% glycerol-containing buffer at -20 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Quick Start™ Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad).DNA Polymerase Activity—RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was evaluated on a 152-nucleotide (nt) RNA template (prepared by in vitro transcription), corresponding to nucleotides 2225-2363 of the Ty3 genome plus 14 additional nucleotides, hybridized to a 32P-5′-endlabeled 21-nt DNA primer. Template-primer was annealed by incubation at 95 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 100 mm NaCl and slow cooling to room temperature. A reaction mixture containing 50 nm template-primer and each dNTP at a final concentration of 250 μm was prepared in buffer comprising 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 9 mm MgCl2. DNA synthesis was initiated at 30 °C by addition of wild-type or mutant RT to a final concentration of 100 nm in a final reaction volume of 10 μl and terminated after 10 min by mixing with an equal volume 89 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA, and 95% (v/v) formamide containing 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Polymerization products were resolved by high voltage denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by phosphorimaging. Processivity during RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was evaluated using the substrate indicated above, but with the RT concentration increased to 200 nm. After incubating RT and template-primer for 5 min at 30 °C, DNA synthesis was initiated by addition of dNTPs and a heparin trap to final concentrations of 250 μm and 2 mg/ml, respectively. The efficiency of the competitor was determined by adding it prior to Ty3 RT and template-primer, which resulted in complete inhibition of DNA synthesis (data not shown). DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was evaluated on HhaI-digested single-stranded M13mp18 DNA (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) to which the 32P-end-labeled M13 universal primer was hybridized. (Unlike the majority of restriction enzymes, HhaI cleaves single-stranded DNA.) Assay conditions were similar to those described above, with the exception that 1.5 nm template-primer was used.Determination of Dissociation Rate Constants by Nucleotide Incorporation—Wild-type and mutant Ty3 RTs (100 nm) were preincubated for 5 min at 30 °C with 8 nm template-primer (40-mer DNA hybridized to a 32P-5′-end-labeled 30-mer DNA primer) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 9 mm MgCl2. Heparin was subsequently added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml, and incubation was continued for varying times before 250 μm dNTP was added. One minute following dNTP addition, the reaction was stopped with an equal volume of 89 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA, and 95% (v/v) formamide containing 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Starting polymerization with the dNTP mixture at varying times following heparin addition reveals the fraction of enzyme bound to the template at a particular time point. The fraction of enzyme bound to the template as a function of time was plotted and fit using KaleidaGraph with a single exponential function: f(t) = exp(-koff·t), where koff is the dissociation rate constant and t is the incubation time with the trap.DNA Polymerase Activity on Substrate Analogs—A 40-nt DNA template containing an abasic lesion was hybridized to a 32P-end-labeled 18-nt DNA primer such that the lesion was positioned 3, 4, 5, or 7 nucleotides from the primer 3′-OH (defining position -1 as the first template-primer base pair in the catalytic center). Template-primer (2.5 nm) was preincubated at 30 °C with 15 nm Ty3 RT in the reaction mixture described above. Synthesis was initiated by addition of dATP to a final concentration of 8 μm, which permitted addition of a single nucleotide. Single nucleotide extension on duplexes containing locked nucleic acid (LNA) substitutions of the primer or template was evaluated in a similar manner or in the presence of all four dNTPs.RNase H Activity—Nonspecific RNase H activity was determined on a 5′-end-labeled 40-nt RNA template annealed to a 30-nt DNA primer (31Lener D. Budihas S.R. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26486-26495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A reaction mixture containing 50 nm template-primer was prepared in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 9 mm MgCl2. Hydrolysis was initiated by addition of enzyme to a final concentration of 100 nm in a final volume of 10 μl and terminated after 30 min by mixing with an equal volume of 89 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA, and 95% (v/v) formamide containing 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Hydrolysis products were resolved by high voltage denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by phosphorimaging. For Ty3 PPT selection, a 46-nt (-)-strand DNA template (corresponding to nucleotides 4780-4809 of the Ty3 genome) was hybridized to a 29-nt PPT-containing RNA including 13 nt 3′ to the PPT/U3 cleavage site. The duplex was annealed as described above, and a reaction mixture containing 50 nm template-primer was prepared in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 9 mm MgCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100. Hydrolysis was initiated by addition of RT to a final concentration of 150 nm in a 80-μl volume. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C. Hydrolysis products were evaluated by high voltage electrophoresis and autoradiography.Sequence Alignment and Structure Modeling—The RT sequences of chosen retroviruses and LTR-containing retrotransposons were multialigned using the ClustalW function of MacVector. The alignment was done in respect to well defined amino acid motifs 1-7 from the RT fingers and palm subdomains (38Xiong Y. Eickbush T.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3353-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). The secondary and tertiary structure prediction was accomplished using MetaServer (available at bioinfo.pl). Two templates with the highest 3D-Jury score (Protein Data Bank codes 1HMV and 1MU2 for HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs, respectively) were chosen to predict the tertiary structure of Ty3 RT using the MODELLER program of the same server.RESULTSMutagenesis Strategy—The lack of detailed structural information for Ty3 RT necessitated applying amino acid sequence alignment and structural prediction programs to locate the counterpart of HIV-1 RT helix αH. Within the DNA polymerase active center of Ty3 RT, the proposed-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Asp-active-site motif between residues 211 and 214 was recently verified biochemically by site-directed mutagenesis (39Bibillo A. Lener D. Klarmann G.J. Le Grice S.F.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Multiple alignments involving amino acid sequences of both retroviral and LTR-containing retrotransposon RTs were conducted (Fig. 1A). Using this strategy, seven conserved segments defined previously by Xiong and Eickbush (38Xiong Y. Eickbush T.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3353-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) were identified within Ty3 RT. As revealed by crystallographic data for retroviral RTs (1Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G.

Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 819-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), these conserved segments are located within the fingers and palm subdomains, with the last segment (motif 7 or the β12-β13 hairpin of HIV-1 RT) connecting the palm and thumb subdomains. C-terminal to this segment in Ty3 RT (amino acids 288-300) is a region with homology to HIV-1 RT helix αH (residues 256-268). Secondary structure prediction analysis was also used to confirm that this sequence of Ty3 RT could assume a helical configuration. Based on these combined approaches, we have tentatively designated Ty3 RT residues 290-298 as the structural counterpart to HIV-1 RT helix αH. The same structural prediction analysis was used to identify the Ty3 counterpart of helices αI and αJ in the thumb of HIV-1 RT (Fig. 1C). Because Gln258, Gly262, and Trp266 of HIV-1 RT occupy the same face of helix αH and are involved in multiple contacts with the sugar phosphate backbone of the primer (Fig. 1B) (1Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughesi S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, Ty3 Asn297 was selected because its HIV-1 equivalent (Asn265) contacts the sugar phosphate backbone of the template. Finally, Ty3 Phe292 was altered to alanine based on the high degree of conservation at this position of LTR-containing retrotransposon RTs.DNA Polymerase Activity of Thumb Mutants—Mutations in the Ty3 RT thumb were initially characterized with respect to their DNA- and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities. Activity was determined in the context of multiple rounds of DNA synthesis or by inclusion of the competitor heparin, restricting this to a single binding event, the results of which are presented in Fig. 2. Under conditions allowing multiple rounds of synthesis, DNA-dependent DNA synthesis activity and pausing patterns of mutants Q290A, N297A, Y298F, and Y298W (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 6, 8, and 9, respectively) were similar to those of wild-type Ty3 RT (lane w). All Phe292 substitutions and mutant Y298A caused a slight diminution in DNA polymerase activity (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-4 and lane 7, respectively). In contrast, the relatively modest G294A substitution resulted in enhanced pausing at multiple positions on the DNA template, some of which were unique to this mutant (Fig. 2A, lane 5). In the presence of heparin, only mutants Q290A and Y298F displayed activity similar to that of wild-type Ty3 RT (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 8, and w, respectively), whereas other mutants showed varying levels of activity. A significant reduction in polymerase activity was observed with mutants F292A, G294A, Y298A, and Y298W. Such a reduction may reflect decreased affinity for template-primer or, alternatively, template-specific features such as secondary structure. A second processivity assay with a shorter DNA template was performed and likewise demonstrated that the processivity of these mutants was still affected (data not shown).Fig. 2A and B, DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of Ty3 RT mutants. Activity was determined in either the absence (A) or presence (B) of the competitor heparin. The amino acids selected for mutagenesis are indicated above each panel, below which is the residue to which they were altered. Lane w, wild-type Ty3 RT. P, unextended primer. The reaction was performed with an HhaI-digested single-stranded M13 DNA template to which a 5′-radiolabeled M13 universal primer was annealed. C and D, RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity evaluated in the absence and presence of heparin, respectively. The nucleic acid substrate used was an in vitro transcribed 152-nt RNA template (comprising sequence 2225-2363 of the Ty3 genome) to which a 5′-radiolabeled DNA primer was annealed. Lanes c, no enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity in the absence of heparin (Fig. 2C) was essentially the same pattern for all mutants, with the exception that enhanced pausing was not evident with mutant G294A on an RNA template (lane 5). Under conditions permitting a single binding event, the activity of mutants Q290A, Y298F, and Y298W was equivalent to or slightly less than that of Ty3 RT (Fig. 2D, lanes 1, 8, 9, and w, respectively). All remaining mutants displayed severe polymerization and processivity defects under these conditions.Dissociation Rate Constants—As a more quantitative measure of interactions involving Ty3 RT and duplex DNA, dissociation rate constants were determined for mutants carrying alanine substitutions (Fig. 3). For each mutant, a time course is presented, and dissociation rate constants have been tabulated in the inset. The value for mutant Q290A (0.098 s-1) is close to that of wild-type Ty3 RT (0.055 s-1), which is in keeping with the data of Fig. 2. Such values are within the general range we (43Cristofaro J.V.

The most significant effect was observed for mutant G294A, which dissociated ∼8-fold more rapidly from template-primer (0.425 s-1), followed by F292A (0.247 s-1), Y298A (0.224 s-1), and N297A (0.150 s-1)"
