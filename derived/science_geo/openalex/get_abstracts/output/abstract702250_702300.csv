https://openalex.org/W4304698157,"The initial step in the sensory transduction pathway underpinning hearing and balance in mammals involves the conversion of force into the gating of a mechanosensory transduction channel1. Despite the profound socioeconomic impacts of hearing disorders and the fundamental biological significance of understanding mechanosensory transduction, the composition, structure and mechanism of the mechanosensory transduction complex have remained poorly characterized. Here we report the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of the native transmembrane channel-like protein 1 (TMC-1) mechanosensory transduction complex isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans. The two-fold symmetric complex is composed of two copies each of the pore-forming TMC-1 subunit, the calcium-binding protein CALM-1 and the transmembrane inner ear protein TMIE. CALM-1 makes extensive contacts with the cytoplasmic face of the TMC-1 subunits, whereas the single-pass TMIE subunits reside on the periphery of the complex, poised like the handles of an accordion. A subset of complexes additionally includes a single arrestin-like protein, arrestin domain protein (ARRD-6), bound to a CALM-1 subunit. Single-particle reconstructions and molecular dynamics simulations show how the mechanosensory transduction complex deforms the membrane bilayer and suggest crucial roles for lipid-protein interactions in the mechanism by which mechanical force is transduced to ion channel gating."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying spinal disinhibition after nerve injury remain unclear. Here, we show in mice that spared nerve injury (SNI), which induces mechanical hypersensitivity and neuropathic pain, triggers homeostatic reduction of inhibitory outputs from dorsal horn parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons onto both primary afferent terminals and excitatory interneurons. The reduction in inhibitory outputs drives hyperactivation of the spinal cord nociceptive pathway, causing mechanical hypersensitivity. We identified the retinoic acid receptor RARα, a central regulator of homeostatic plasticity, as the key molecular mediator for this synaptic disinhibition. Deletion of RARα in spinal PV+ neurons or application of an RARα antagonist in the spinal cord prevented the development of SNI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Our results identify RARα as a crucial molecular effector for neuropathic pain and a potential target for its treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4304698260,"Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is an extraordinary enhancement of the electrical conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field. It is conventionally associated with a field-induced spin polarization that drastically reduces spin scattering and electric resistance. Ferrimagnetic Mn3Si2Te6 is an intriguing exception to this rule: it exhibits a seven-order-of-magnitude reduction in ab plane resistivity that occurs only when a magnetic polarization is avoided1,2. Here, we report an exotic quantum state that is driven by ab plane chiral orbital currents (COC) flowing along edges of MnTe6 octahedra. The c axis orbital moments of ab plane COC couple to the ferrimagnetic Mn spins to drastically increase the ab plane conductivity (CMR) when an external magnetic field is aligned along the magnetic hard c axis. Consequently, COC-driven CMR is highly susceptible to small direct currents exceeding a critical threshold, and can induce a time-dependent, bistable switching that mimics a first-order ‘melting transition’ that is a hallmark of the COC state. The demonstrated current-control of COC-enabled CMR offers a new paradigm for quantum technologies. Current-control of chiral orbital current-enabled colossal magnetoresistance offers a new paradigm for quantum technologies."

It supports the entire clinical workflow from diagnosis, therapy planning, intervention, and follow-up. In this paper, we propose a novel tool to accurately process a full-face segmentation in about 5 minutes that would otherwise require an average of 7h of manual work by experienced clinicians. This work focuses on the integration of the state-of-the-art UNEt TRansformers (UNETR) of the Medical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence (MONAI) framework. We trained and tested our models using 618 de-identified Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) volumetric images of the head acquired with several parameters from different centers for a generalized clinical application. Our results on a 5-fold cross-validation showed high accuracy and robustness with a Dice score up to 0.962±0.02. Our code is available on our public GitHub repository."
https://openalex.org/W4304694746,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) represent a major advance in ovarian cancer, now as a treatment and as a maintenance therapy in the upfront and recurrent settings. However, patients often develop resistance to PARPis, underlining the importance of dissecting resistance mechanisms. Here, we report different dosing/timing schemes of PARPi treatment in BRCA2-mutant PEO1 cells, resulting in the simultaneous development of distinct resistance mechanisms. PARPi-resistant variants PEO1/OlaJR, established by higher initial doses and short-term PARPi treatment, develops PARPi resistance by rapidly restoring functional BRCA2 and promoting drug efflux activity. In contrast, PEO1/OlaR, developed by lower initial doses with long-term PARPi exposure, shows no regained BRCA2 function but a mesenchymal-like phenotype with greater invasion ability, and exhibits activated ATR/CHK1 and suppressed EZH2/MUS81 signaling cascades to regain HR repair and fork stabilization, respectively. Our study suggests that PARPi resistance mechanisms can be governed by treatment strategies and have a molecular basis on BRCA2 functionality. Further, we define different mechanisms that may serve as useful biomarkers to assess subsequent treatment strategies in PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4304758004,"Changes in metabolism are a hallmark of cancer, but molecular signatures of altered bioenergetics to aid in clinical decision-making do not currently exist. We recently identified a group of human tumors with constitutively reduced expression of the mitochondrial structural protein, Mic60, also called mitofilin or inner membrane mitochondrial protein (IMMT). These Mic60-low tumors exhibit severe loss of mitochondrial fitness, paradoxically accompanied by increased metastatic propensity and upregulation of a unique transcriptome of Interferon (IFN) signaling and Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). Here, we show that an optimized, 11-gene signature of Mic60-low tumors is differentially expressed in multiple malignancies, compared to normal tissues, and correlates with poor patient outcome. When analyzed in three independent patient cohorts of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the Mic60-low gene signature was associated with aggressive disease variants, local inflammation, FOLFIRINOX failure and shortened survival, independently of age, gender, or stage. Therefore, the 11-gene Mic60-low signature may provide an easily accessible molecular tool to stratify patient risk in PDAC and potentially other malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W4304758327,"Airway epithelial damage is a common feature in respiratory diseases such as COPD and has been suggested to drive inflammation and progression of disease. These features manifest as remodeling and destruction of lung epithelial characteristics including loss of small airways which contributes to chronic airway inflammation. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) has been shown to play a role in epithelial function and dysregulation, such as in cilia disassembly, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oxidative stress responses, and has been implicated in several diseases. We thus used ACY-1083, an inhibitor with high selectivity for HDAC6, and characterized its effects on epithelial function including epithelial disruption, cytokine production, remodeling, mucociliary clearance and cell characteristics. Primary lung epithelial air-liquid interface cultures from COPD patients were used and the impacts of TNF, TGF-β, cigarette smoke and bacterial challenges on epithelial function in the presence and absence of ACY-1083 were tested. Each challenge increased the permeability of the epithelial barrier whilst ACY-1083 blocked this effect and even decreased permeability in the absence of challenge. TNF was also shown to increase production of cytokines and mucins, with ACY-1083 reducing the effect. We observed that COPD-relevant stimulations created damage to the epithelium as seen on immunohistochemistry sections and that treatment with ACY-1083 maintained an intact cell layer and preserved mucociliary function. Interestingly, there was no direct effect on ciliary beat frequency or tight junction proteins indicating other mechanisms for the protected epithelium. In summary, ACY-1083 shows protection of the respiratory epithelium during COPD-relevant challenges which indicates a future potential to restore epithelial structure and function to halt disease progression in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W4304701090,"A dynamical model linking stress, social support, and health has been recently proposed and numerically analyzed from a classical point of view of integer-order calculus. Although interesting observations have been obtained in this way, the present work conducts a fractional-order analysis of that model. Under a periodic forcing of an environmental stress variable, the perceived stress has been analyzed through bifurcation diagrams and two well-known metrics of entropy and complexity, such as spectral entropy and C0 complexity. The results obtained by numerical simulations have shown novel insights into how stress evolves with frequency and amplitude of the perturbation, as well as with initial conditions for the system variables. More precisely, it has been observed that stress can alternate between chaos, periodic oscillations, and stable behaviors as the fractional order varies. Moreover, the perturbation frequency has revealed a narrow interval for the chaotic oscillations, while its amplitude may present different values indicating a low sensitivity regarding chaos generation. Also, the perceived stress has been noted to be highly sensitive to initial conditions for the symptoms of stress-related ill-health and for the social support received from family and friends. This work opens new directions of research whereby fractional calculus might offer more insight into psychology, life sciences, mental disorders, and stress-free well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4304701148,"The causes that trigger the onset of dementia are still unknown. Recently there has been an increasing interest in the possible role of infectious agents in the brain in the pathogenesis of this condition. Amongst the viruses, members of the Herpesviridae family, namely herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV6), human herpesvirus-7 (HHV7) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) have been suggested as potential causes of the disease. However, the relative importance of these and other viruses in contributing to dementia remains unclear. We evaluated the association between seropositivity status of all viruses available in a large, population-based dataset (the UK Biobank) and dementia risk in an unbiased way. Of the 15 viruses investigated, our results showed a statistically significant increase of dementia risk associated only with HSV1 seropositivity (OR 2.14, 95% C.I. 1.21–3.81). However, by combining the data we found that seropositivity for 4 viruses (HSV1, HHV6, HHV7 and VZV) also significantly increases the risk of dementia (OR = 2.37, 95% C.I. 1.43–3.92). These four viruses have been described previously as neurotropic viruses. Our results provide support for a role for neurotropic viruses in the pathology of dementia."
https://openalex.org/W4304758916,"Renal fibrosis represents the final common outcome of chronic kidney disease of virtually any etiology. However, the mechanism underlying the evolution of renal fibrosis remains to be addressed. This study sought to clarify whether RIP1-RIP3-mediated necroptosis is involved in renal fibrosis via Wnt3α/β-catenin/GSK-3β signaling in vitro and in a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Rats with UUO were administered RIP inhibitors (necrostatin-1 or GSK872) or β-catenin/TCF inhibitor ICG-001 daily for 7 consecutive days. UUO caused significant renal tubular necrosis and overexpression of RIP1-RIP3-MLKL axis proteins, and was accompanied by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and renal fibrosis. Oxidative stress caused by UUO was closely associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which resulted in apoptotic cell death via Wnt3α/β-catenin/GSK-3β signaling. All of these effects were abolished by an RIP inhibitor (necrostatin-1 or GSK872) or ICG-001. In H 2 O 2 -treated HK-2 cells, both RIP inhibitor and ICG-001 decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species production and apoptotic cells, but increased cell viability. Activated Wnt3α/β-catenin/GSK-3β signaling was decreased by either RIP inhibitor or ICG-001. Our findings suggest that RIP1-RIP3-mediated necroptosis contributes to the development of renal fibrosis via Wnt3α/β-catenin/GSK-3β signaling in UUO and may be a therapeutic target for protection against renal scarring of other origins."
https://openalex.org/W4304172770,"Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, a chromatin modifying complex, which mediates methylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3), a repressive chromatin mark. Genetic alterations in EZH2 in melanoma include amplifications and activating point mutations at tyrosine 641 (Y641) whose underlying oncogenic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we found that expression of Ezh2Y641F causes upregulation of a subset of interferon-regulated genes in melanoma cells. Upregulation of these genes was not a direct effect of changes in H3K27me3, but via a non-canonical interaction between Ezh2 and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (Stat3). Ezh2 and Stat3 together function as transcriptional activators to mediate gene activation of numerous genes, including MHC Class 1b antigen processing genes. Furthermore, expression of Stat3 is required to maintain an anti-tumor immune response in Ezh2Y641F melanomas and to prevent melanoma progression and recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W4304757291,"Myoglobin (MB) is known to bind and deliver oxygen in striated muscles at high expression levels. MB is also expressed at much reduced levels in mammary epithelial cells, where the protein´s function is unclear. In this study, we aim to determine whether MB impacts fatty acid trafficking and facilitates aerobic fatty acid ß-oxidation in mammary epithelial cells. We utilized MB-wildtype versus MB-knockout mice and human breast cancer cells to examine the impact of MB and its oxygenation status on fatty acid metabolism in mouse milk and mammary epithelia. MB deficient cells were generated through CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN approaches and exposed to various oxygen tensions. Fatty acid profiling of milk and cell extracts were performed along with cell labelling and immunocytochemistry. Our findings show that MB expression in mammary epithelial cells promoted fatty acid oxidation while reducing stearyl-CoA desaturase activity for lipogenesis. In cells and milk product, presence of oxygenated MB significantly elevated indices of limited fatty acid ß-oxidation, i.e., the organelle-bound removal of a C2 moiety from long-chain saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids, thus shifting the composition toward more saturated and shorter fatty acid species. Presence of the globin also increased cytoplasmic fatty acid solubility under normoxia and fatty acid deposition to lipid droplets under severe hypoxia. We conclude that MB can function in mammary epithelia as intracellular O2-dependent shuttle of oxidizable fatty acid substrates. MB's impact on limited oxidation of fatty acids could generate inflammatory mediator lipokines, such as 7-hexadecenoate. Thus, the novel functions of MB in breast epithelia described herein range from controlling fatty acid turnover and homeostasis to influencing inflammatory signalling cascade. Future work is needed to analyse to what extent these novel roles of MB also apply to myocytic cell physiology and malignant cell behaviour, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4304758303,"FOXG1 Syndrome (FS) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutation of the FOXG1 gene, which encodes a transcriptional regulator important for telencephalic brain development. People with FS have marked developmental delays, impaired ambulation, movement disorders, seizures, and behavior abnormalities including autistic features. Current therapeutic approaches are entirely symptomatic, however the ability to rescue phenotypes in mouse models of other genetic neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and Phelan-McDermid syndrome by postnatal expression of gene products has led to hope that similar approaches could help modify the disease course in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as FS. While FoxG1 protein function plays a critical role in embryonic brain development, the ongoing adult expression of FoxG1 and behavioral phenotypes that present when FoxG1 function is removed postnatally provides support for opportunity for improvement with postnatal treatment. Here we generated a new mouse allele of Foxg1 that disrupts protein expression and characterized the behavioral and structural brain phenotypes in heterozygous mutant animals. These mutant animals display changes in locomotor behavior, gait, anxiety, social interaction, aggression, and learning and memory compared to littermate controls. Additionally, they have structural brain abnormalities reminiscent of people with FS. This information provides a framework for future studies to evaluate the potential for post-natal expression of FoxG1 to modify the disease course in this severe neurodevelopmental disorder."

However, in sub-Saharan Africa, increases in ANC coverage have not correlated well with improved maternal and fetal outcomes suggesting the quality of ANC received could be the missing link. This study assessed ANC quality and its effect on adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who delivered at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital.A cross-sectional study was conducted among women who delivered at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital within the study period. Women were selected through systematic sampling and interviewed using a pretested structured questionnaire as well as review of their medical records. Data were collected on their sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics, care provided during ANC and delivery outcomes. Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test. Factors associated with quality of ANC and adverse pregnancy outcomes were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression to generate crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS and GraphPad Prism. P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.950 women were recruited into the study with mean age of 30.39±5.57 years. Less than one-tenth (7.6%) of the women received good quality ANC, 63.4% had average quality ANC, and 29.0% received poor quality ANC. Increasing educational level and initiating ANC in the first trimester [aOR 0.2; 95%CI 0.08-0.68; p<0.001] increased the odds of receiving good quality ANC while being unemployed decreased the odds of receiving good quality ANC [aOR 0.3; 95% CI 0.12-0.65; p = 0.003]. Receiving poor and average quality of ANC were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing anaemia during pregnancy, preeclampsia with severe features or delivering a low birth weight baby.Most women did not receive good quality ANC. High quality ANC should be provided while the women are encouraged to comply with the recommendations during ANC."
https://openalex.org/W4303859356,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is the most medically relevant tick-transmitted Flavivirus in Eurasia, targeting the host central nervous system and frequently causing severe encephalitis. The primary function of its capsid protein (TBEVC) is to recruit the viral RNA and form a nucleocapsid. Additional functionality of Flavivirus capsid proteins has been documented, but further investigation is needed for TBEVC. Here, we show the first capsid protein 3D structure of a member of the tick-borne flaviviruses group. The structure of monomeric Δ16-TBEVC was determined using high-resolution multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Based on natural in vitro TBEVC homodimerization, the dimeric interfaces were identified by hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (MS). Although the assembly of flaviviruses occurs in endoplasmic reticulum–derived vesicles, we observed that TBEVC protein also accumulated in the nuclei and nucleoli of infected cells. In addition, the predicted bipartite nuclear localization sequence in the TBEVC C-terminal part was confirmed experimentally, and we described the interface between TBEVC bipartite nuclear localization sequence and import adapter protein importin-alpha using X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, our coimmunoprecipitation coupled with MS identification revealed 214 interaction partners of TBEVC, including viral envelope and nonstructural NS5 proteins and a wide variety of host proteins involved mainly in rRNA processing and translation initiation. Metabolic labeling experiments further confirmed that TBEVC and other flaviviral capsid proteins are able to induce translational shutoff and decrease of 18S rRNA.

These findings may substantially help to design a targeted therapy against TBEV. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is an important human pathogen belonging to the tick-borne viruses from the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus. Except for tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFVs), the Flavivirus genus also includes mosquito-borne flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), or Zika virus (ZIKV). As a neurotropic virus, TBEV targets mainly the central nervous system, and the infection in humans may result in severe encephalitis or meningoencephalitis (1Gould E.A. Solomon T. Pathogenic flaviviruses.Lancet (London, England). 2008; 371: 500-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). All members of the genus Flavivirus share a similar architecture of their virions, genomic organization, and life cycle. The flavivirus genome consists of a single-stranded RNA of positive polarity, approximately 11 kilobases long. Viral genomic RNA (gRNA) contains one open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein of about 3400 amino acids. The polyprotein is cotranslationally and post-translationally processed to three structural (pre-membrane [prM/M], capsid [C], and envelope [E]) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). While the structural proteins represent the main building units of the viral particle, the nonstructural proteins participate in viral replication. In addition, the flavivirus genome includes 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, which are characterized by the presence of many secondary structures. Flaviviruses enter the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the released viral gRNA is translated into an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–associated transmembrane polyprotein using the host enzymes. Viral gRNA is replicated by the nonstructural proteins in ER-derived vesicular compartments. Nascent gRNA is associated with the capsid protein resulting in nucleocapsid assembly. Formed nucleocapsids are further enveloped by ER-derived membrane containing prM/M and E proteins while budding into the ER lumen. Enveloped virions are then transported along the host cell secretory pathway and released from the cell by fusion of transport vesicles with the plasma membrane (2Barrows N.J. Campos R.K. Liao K.C.

Despite being one of the least conserved proteins among flaviviruses (identity is lower than 40%), the 3D structure of various flaviviral C proteins is remarkably similar (4Byk L.A. Gamarnik A.V. Properties and functions of the dengue virus capsid protein.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2016; 3: 263-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5Pulkkinen L.I.A. Butcher S.J. Anastasina M. Tick-borne encephalitis virus: a structural view.Viruses. 2018; 10: 350Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Flaviviral C proteins are highly basic proteins of approximately 100 amino acid residues forming a homodimer in solution. Based on the structural studies on DENV, ZIKV, and WNV, monomeric C protein consists of four α-helices (α1–α4) and an unstructured N-terminal domain. Dimerization of C protein is facilitated mainly by interactions of antiparallel α2–α2′ and α4–α4′ helices of the two monomeric subunits, forming thus the main dimer interface. The dimer shows asymmetric charged surface distribution: the apolar surface on one side of a molecule and the positively charged region on the other side. Hydrophobic cleft formed by α1–α1′ and α2–α2′ helices was proposed to interact with the membrane, whereas highly positively charged regions of α4–α4′ helices are supposed to interact with viral gRNA (6Ma L. Jones C.T. Groesch T.D. Kuhn R.J. Post C.B. Solution structure of dengue virus capsid protein reveals another fold.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The structure of TBEVC has not been experimentally described yet; however, the predictions closely follow the structures of already characterized C proteins from DENV, ZIKV, and WNV (5Pulkkinen L.I.A.

Hadravová R. et al.Characterization and in vitro assembly of tick-borne encephalitis virus C protein.FEBS Lett. 2020; 594: 1989-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) in combination with the occurrence of TBEV-induced transcriptional and translational shutoff (23Selinger M.

Here, we characterize the capsid protein of a TBFV for the first time, focusing on its structure, subcellular distribution, interacting network, and biological relevance during TBEV infection in human neural cells. To better understand the structure–function relationship of TBEVC, we solved its 3D structure using high-resolution multidimensional NMR spectroscopy in combination with computational methods. The resonances were assigned to protein atoms and deposited into the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) with BMRB ID: 34709. Structure calculation was based on intramolecular distance 1H–1H constraints obtained from NOE experiments and backbone dihedral angle (φ, ψ) restrictions estimated by TALOS+ (24Shen Y. Delaglio F.

The 20 best-calculated structures of Δ16-TBEVC [23] out of 1000 were chosen and superimposed over the backbone heavy atoms of helices (Fig. 1A). The average RMSD relative to the mean heavy atom positions of the best-defined parts (all four α-helices) is 1.3 ± 0.3 Å. The monomeric Δ16-TBEVC consists of four α-helices connected by loops (Fig. 1B). The individual parts of the structure were denoted as: α-helix 1 (α1), post-α1 loop, α-helix 2 (α2), post-α2 loop, α-helix 3 (α3), post-α3 loop, and α-helix 4 (α4). Such structural motives arrangement is conserved among the capsid proteins across the whole family of flaviviruses (6Ma L. Jones C.T. Groesch T.D. Kuhn R.J. Post C.B.

The main difference is that TBEVC N-terminal unstructured part is shorter (by 7–17 amino acids). Thus, while within Δ20-DENVC, Δ25-ZIKVC, and Δ23-WNVC, helices 2, 3, and 4 start almost at the same position, all helices in Δ16-TBEVC are sequentially shifted by more than six amino acids toward the N terminus (Table 1). Even so, the length of individual helices across structures is very similar.

Although we determined the NMR structure of the monomeric Δ16-TBEVC protein, the structures of other flaviviral capsid proteins suggested that these proteins occur naturally as homodimers (6Ma L. Jones C.T. Groesch T.D. Kuhn R.J. Post C.B. Solution structure of dengue virus capsid protein reveals another fold.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To investigate whether Δ16-TBEVC protein forms dimerize, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and chemical crosslinking coupled with mass spectrometric detection (XL–MS) were employed. SEC, performed under the same conditions as the NMR experiments, demonstrated the approximate molecular weight of Δ16 TBEVC of about 24 kDa, corresponding to the dimeric form (Fig. 2. A and B). The only conditions under which we observed signal for the monomeric form was in a 10-times diluted TBEVC in the presence of 1% SDS (Fig. 2C). Thus, we concluded that under native conditions, the equilibrium between monomer and dimer was shifted toward the dimeric form. This was also consistent with the results of SEC analysis during the purification process, where Δ16-TBEVC (of molecular weight 9 kDa) eluted earlier than lysozyme, a protein of molecular weight 11 kDa (Fig. 2, D and E). This indicated that the formation of Δ16-TBEVC dimer or even its higher oligomers occurs during the protein production in bacterial cells. Next, we performed XL–MS using the amine-reactive homobifunctional and MS-cleavable crosslinker C2 capable to generate covalent bonds mainly between lysine residues in close proximity of up to 25 Å (26Ihling C.H.

Five different protein-to-crosslinker molar ratios (1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) were applied, and crosslinking products were visualized by SDS-PAGE. Figure 3A shows the presence of both monomeric and dimeric forms, also with the indication of trimers with increasing C2 concentration. For further LC–MS/MS analysis, the protein-to-crosslinker molar ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2 were selected to target mainly the covalently bound Δ16-TBEVC dimers. The XL–MS resulted in the identification of four unique lysine–lysine linkages (Table 2) observed at all three ratios (Table S2 and Figs. S2–S5). Evaluation and visualization (Fig. 3B) of these linkages were done on a model predicted by I-TASSER server (5Pulkkinen L.I.A. Butcher S.J. Anastasina M.

Based on the measured distances and spatial comparison, we evaluated all four linkages as intermonomeric ones. Their intramonomeric character was excluded because of the following findings (Table 2): K59–K19 and K59–K24 are not possible because of steric hindrance, K59–K90 exceeds the Cα–Cα linkable distance (26Ihling C.H.

Thus, similarly to other flaviviral capsid proteins (6Ma L. Jones C.T. Groesch T.D. Kuhn R.J. Post C.B. Solution structure of dengue virus capsid protein reveals another fold.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Open table in a new tab To calculate the structure of the Δ16-TBEVC dimer, we first identified the residues involved in the dimeric interface. As NMR spectroscopy provided only a few weak signals, which could not be conclusively taken as intermonomeric restraints, we performed the hydrogen–deuterium exchange experiment (HDX–MS). It was performed in three repetitions, including protein labeling at five different time points: 20 s, 2 min, 20 min, 2 h, and 6 h (Table S3 and Fig. 4A). To visualize the HDX evolution of 16 peptides, which have survived the filtering process, the web-based application MStools (31Kavan D. Man P. MSTools—web based application for visualization and presentation of HXMS data.Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2011; 302: 53-58Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was applied using the values of relative fractional uptake (RFU) obtained from DynamX software. The HDX evolution for selected peptides Q27–H47, M38–L45, F61–A70, T71–L84, and M85–R95 is shown on the deuteration uptake plots (Fig. 4B), and the deuteration profiles of full-length Δ16-TBEVC obtained at 20 s and 6 h are presented on the predicted structure of the Δ16-TBEVC monomer (Fig. 4C). The results showed that HDX was the slowest within α2 and α4, especially in their middle regions. It means that these regions were spatially poorly accessible, indicating the compactness of this part of the structural motif as an effect of the dimer formation. Thus, this experiment not only confirmed the protein dimerization but also provided information about the regions highly involved in the interaction of Δ16-TBEVC monomers within the dimer. We selected the following interacting residues for docking by Haddock (32Van Zundert G. Rodrigues J. Trellet M. Schmitz C. Kastritis P.

The docking was performed for all the best previously calculated 20 Δ16-TBEVC monomer structures, and the final dimeric structures were superimposed over the backbone heavy atoms of α2–α4 (Fig. 5A). The average RMSD relative to the mean heavy atom positions was 1.7 ± 0.4 Å. Finally, the resulting dimers were deposited into the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) with PDB ID: 7YWQ. The average structure of the Δ16-TBEVC homodimer (Fig. 5B) is a tightly packed and centrally symmetric molecule in which the contact surfaces of the monomers are formed predominantly by antiparallel α2/α2′ and α4/α4′ and probably also by the participation of α1/post-α1′ loop and α1’/post-α1 loop. The experimental homodimer structure of Δ16-TBEVC matches the predicted structure well, sharing the same topology with already solved structures of Δ20-DENVC (6Ma L. Jones C.T. Groesch T.D. Kuhn R.J.

Close inspection of the helix 4 of TBEVC revealed a putative bipartite nuclear localization sequence (bNLS) 75-RKIKR-79 and 90-KRGKRR-95 (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, alignment of the amino acid sequence of capsid proteins of other TBFVs, Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV), Louping ill virus (LIV), and Powassan virus (POWV), to TBEVC proteins revealed similar arginine- and lysine-rich bNLS motifs at the C terminus (Fig. 6B).

https://openalex.org/W4304701078,"Background Despite the current sustainable development goal period (i.e. SDG 3), the prevention of maternal and neonatal mortality is not satisfactory in Ethiopia. Keeping women knowledgeable about antenatal care and maintaining a positive attitude towards its uptake, particularly in the marginalized rural community is crucial. However, evidence regarding the knowledge and attitude of women towards antenatal care uptake is scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to assess factors affecting comprehensive knowledge of antenatal care and attitude towards its uptake among women delivered at home in rural Sehala Seyemit district, northern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 1 st to October 15 th , 2020. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 653 women. The data were collected using a semi-structured interview guide. Data were entered into EPI INFO 7.1.2 and analyzed by SPSS version 25. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were undertaken to identify factors associated with women’s knowledge of antenatal care and attitude towards its uptake. The level of significant association in the multivariable analysis was determined based on a p-value of &lt; 0.05. Results Women’s knowledge of antenatal care and positive attitude towards its uptake was 56.5% and 75.2%, respectively. Older age (AOR = 7.2; 95% CI: 3.43, 15.1), media exposure (AOR = 3.69; 95% CI: 2.41, 5.65), history of abortion (AOR = 11.6; 95% CI: 3.3, 14.6), time to reach health facility (AOR = 4.58; 95% CI: 3.05, 6.88), and history of obstetric danger signs (AOR = 7.3; 95% CI: 3.92, 13.64) were factors significantly associated with knowledge of antenatal care. Furthermore, higher decision-making power (AOR = 8.3; 95% CI: 4.8, 13.83), adequate knowledge of antenatal care (AOR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.26, 3.71), delivery attended by health extension workers (AOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1), and media exposure (AOR = 2.27; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.97) were predictors of a favorable attitude towards antenatal care utilization. Conclusion Although the majority of women in the present study had a favorable attitude towards antenatal care uptake, their knowledge level was inadequate. Strengthening access to transportation, mass media, involvement in household decision-making, and encouraging women to deliver at a health facility by a skilled provider may increase women’s knowledge and attitude towards antenatal care uptake, thereby improving maternal healthcare service uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4304701102,"Removal or protection from biostratinomic agents of decomposition, such as predators and scavengers, is widely seen as a requirement for high-quality preservation of soft tissues in the fossil record. In this context, extremely rapid burial is an oft-cited mechanism for shielding remains from degradation, but not all fossils fit nicely into this paradigm. Dinosaurian mummies in particular seemingly require two mutually exclusive taphonomic processes to preserve under that framework: desiccation and rapid burial. Here we present a recently prepared Edmontosaurus mummy that reveals an alternate fossilization pathway for resistant soft tissues (e.g., skin and nails). While the skin on this specimen is well-preserved in three dimensions and contains biomarkers, it is deflated and marked by the first documented examples of injuries consistent with carnivore activity on dinosaurian soft tissue during the perimortem interval. Incomplete scavenging of the carcass provided a route for the gases, fluids, and microbes associated with decomposition to escape, allowing more durable soft tissues to persist through the weeks to months required for desiccation prior to entombment and fossilization. This pathway is consistent with actualistic observations and explains why dinosaurian skin, while rare, is more commonly preserved than expected if extreme circumstances were required for its preservation. More broadly, our assumptions guide specimen collection and research, and the presence of soft tissues and biomolecules in fossils that demonstrably were not rapidly buried, such as this mummy, suggests that such types of evidence may be substantially more common than previously assumed."
https://openalex.org/W4304701114,"Gynandropsis gynandra (spider plant) is an African traditional leafy vegetable rich in minerals, vitamins and health-promoting compounds with potential for health promotion, micronutrients supplementation and income generation for stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies. However, information on biomass productivity is limited and consequently constrains breeders’ ability to select high-yielding genotypes and end-users to make decisions on suitable cultivation and production systems. This study aimed to assess the phenotypic variability in biomass and related traits in a collection of G . gynandra advanced lines to select elite genotypes for improved cultivar development. Seventy-one advanced lines selected from accessions originating from Asia, West Africa, East Africa and Southern Africa were evaluated over two years with two replicates in a greenhouse using a 9 x 8 alpha lattice design. Significant statistical differences were observed among lines and genotype origins for all fourteen biomass and related traits. The results revealed three clusters, with each cluster dominated by lines derived from accessions from Asia (Cluster 1), West Africa (Cluster 2), and East/Southern Africa (Cluster 3). The West African and East/Southern African groups were comparable in biomass productivity and superior to the Asian group. Specifically, the West African group had a low number of long primary branches, high dry matter content and flowered early. The East/Southern African group was characterized by broad leaves, late flowering, a high number of short primary branches and medium dry matter content and was a candidate for cultivar release. The maintenance of lines’ membership to their group of origin strengthens the hypothesis of geographical signature in cleome diversity and genetic driver of the observed variation. High genetic variance, broad-sense heritability and genetic gains showed the potential to improve biomass yield and related traits. Significant and positive correlations among biomass per plant, plant height, stem diameter and leaf size showed the potential of simultaneous and direct selection for farmers’ desired traits. The present results provide insights into the diversity of spider plant genotypes for biomass productivity and represent key resources for further improvement in the species."

The ISARIC 4C mortality score provides mortality risk prediction at admission to hospital based on demographic and physiological parameters. Here we evaluate dynamic use of the 4C score at different points following admission. Score components were extracted for 6,373 patients admitted to Barts Health NHS Trust hospitals between 1st August 2020 and 19th July 2021 and total score calculated every 48 hours for 28 days. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) statistics were used to evaluate discrimination of the score at admission and subsequent inpatient days. Patients who were still in hospital at day 6 were more likely to die if they had a higher score at day 6 than others also still in hospital who had the same score at admission. Discrimination of dynamic scoring in those still in hospital was superior with the area under the curve 0.71 (95% CI 0.69-0.74) at admission and 0.82 (0.80-0.85) by day 8. Clinically useful changes in the dynamic parts of the score are unlikely to be associated with subject-level measurements. Dynamic use of the ISARIC 4C score is likely to provide accurate and timely information on mortality risk during a patient's hospital admission."

Here, we tackle one of the enduring puzzles about the U.S. Endangered Species Act, often considered a model for endangered species protection globally: Why have so few species been successfully recovered? For the period of 1992–2020, we analyzed trends in the population sizes of species of concern, trends in the time between when species are first petitioned for listing and when they actually receive protection, and trends in funding for the listing and recovery of imperiled species. We find that small population sizes at time of listing, coupled with delayed protection and insufficient funding, continue to undermine one of the world’s strongest laws for protecting biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W4303859357,"Metabolic networks are complex, intersecting, and composed of numerous enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions that transfer various molecular moieties among metabolites. Thus, robust reconstruction of metabolic networks requires metabolite moieties to be tracked, which cannot be readily achieved with mass spectrometry (MS) alone. We previously developed an Ion Chromatography-ultrahigh resolution-MS1/data independent-MS2 method to track the simultaneous incorporation of the heavy isotopes 13C and 15N into the moieties of purine/pyrimidine nucleotides in mammalian cells. Ultrahigh resolution-MS1 resolves and counts multiple tracer atoms in intact metabolites, while data independent-tandem MS (MS2) determines isotopic enrichment in their moieties without concern for the numerous mass isotopologue source ions to be fragmented. Together, they enabled rigorous MS-based reconstruction of metabolic networks at specific enzyme levels. We have expanded this approach to trace the labeled atom fate of [13C6]-glucose in 3D A549 spheroids in response to the anticancer agent selenite and that of [13C5,15N2]-glutamine in 2D BEAS-2B cells in response to arsenite transformation. We deduced altered activities of specific enzymes in the Krebs cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis, and UDP-GlcNAc synthesis pathways elicited by the stressors. These metabolic details help elucidate the resistance mechanism of 3D versus 2D A549 cultures to selenite and metabolic reprogramming that can mediate the transformation of BEAS-2B cells by arsenite."
https://openalex.org/W4304701079,"Questions on the timing and the center of the Indo-European language dispersal are central to debates on the formation of the European and Asian linguistic landscapes and are deeply intertwined with questions on the archaeology and population history of these continents. Recent palaeogenomic studies support scenarios in which the core Indo-European languages spread with the expansion of Early Bronze Age Yamnaya herders that originally inhabited the East European steppes. Questions on the Yamnaya and Pre-Yamnaya locations of the language community that ultimately gave rise to the Indo-European language family are heavily dependent on linguistic reconstruction of the subsistence of Proto-Indo-European speakers. A central question, therefore, is how important the role of agriculture was among the speakers of this protolanguage. In this study, we perform a qualitative etymological analysis of all previously postulated Proto-Indo-European terminology related to cereal cultivation and cereal processing. On the basis of the evolution of the subsistence strategies of consecutive stages of the protolanguage, we find that one or perhaps two cereal terms can be reconstructed for the basal Indo-European stage, also known as Indo-Anatolian, but that core Indo-European, here also including Tocharian, acquired a more elaborate set of terms. Thus, we linguistically document an important economic shift from a mostly non-agricultural to a mixed agro-pastoral economy between the basal and core Indo-European speech communities. It follows that the early, eastern Yamnaya of the Don-Volga steppe, with its lack of evidence for agricultural practices, does not offer a perfect archaeological proxy for the core Indo-European language community and that this stage of the language family more likely reflects a mixed subsistence as proposed for western Yamnaya groups around or to the west of the Dnieper River."
https://openalex.org/W4304701109,"Francisella tularensis, the bacterium that causes the zoonosis tularemia, and its genetic near neighbor species, can be difficult or impossible to cultivate from complex samples. Thus, there is a lack of genomic information for these species that has, among other things, limited the development of robust detection assays for F. tularensis that are both specific and sensitive. The objective of this study was to develop and validate approaches to capture, enrich, sequence, and analyze Francisella DNA present in DNA extracts generated from complex samples. RNA capture probes were designed based upon the known pan genome of F. tularensis and other diverse species in the family Francisellaceae. Probes that targeted genomic regions also present in non-Francisellaceae species were excluded, and probes specific to particular Francisella species or phylogenetic clades were identified. The capture-enrichment system was then applied to diverse, complex DNA extracts containing low-level Francisella DNA, including human clinical tularemia samples, environmental samples (i.e., animal tissue and air filters), and whole ticks/tick cell lines, which was followed by sequencing of the enriched samples. Analysis of the resulting data facilitated rigorous and unambiguous confirmation of the detection of F. tularensis or other Francisella species in complex samples, identification of mixtures of different Francisella species in the same sample, analysis of gene content (e.g., known virulence and antimicrobial resistance loci), and high-resolution whole genome-based genotyping. The benefits of this capture-enrichment system include: even very low target DNA can be amplified; it is culture-independent, reducing exposure for research and/or clinical personnel and allowing genomic information to be obtained from samples that do not yield isolates; and the resulting comprehensive data not only provide robust means to confirm the presence of a target species in a sample, but also can provide data useful for source attribution, which is important from a genomic epidemiology perspective."
https://openalex.org/W4304701129,"Introduction Breastfeeding has numerous advantages for infant, mother and society. However, many mothers discontinue breastfeeding due to problems they encounter. This study aimed to identify problems commonly experienced by breastfeeding mothers during the first six months in Kinshasa. Methods A prospective cohort study was carried out in Kinshasa from October 2012 to July 2013. A total of 422 mother-infant couples were recruited shortly after being discharged from twelve maternity facilities in Kinshasa and followed-up for six months. Interviews were conducted at the mother’s house during the first week after birth, and thereafter at monthly intervals for six months. Data included mother’s sociodemographic characteristics, the breastfeeding problems she experienced and information on child’s feeding. Incidences of breastfeeding problems encountered during different periods were calculated as well as their confidence intervals. Results Cracked or sore nipples, insufficient production of milk and breast engorgement were the most commonly experienced problems by lactating mothers. The problems occurred mainly during the first week (17.1%; CI 95% 13.7–21.1) and the rest of the first month (16.2%; CI 95% 12.8–20.3). Conclusions The first month after birth presents the most risk for the occurrence of breastfeeding problems. Mothers should be supported as soon as possible after delivery, to improve their breastfeeding performance and to be informed on how to maintain breast milk supply."

The equity is an important index of a reasonable allocation of health resources. This study aims to evaluate the mental health resources and its equity allocation in Hunan Province, which is one of the typical central south areas of China, so as to provide reference for the development of mental health in China and other areas.Data related to mental health resources was obtained from the Project of Mental Health Resources in Hunan Province, which was conducted by the Department of Hunan Mental Health Center in 2019. The Gini coefficient, the Theil index and other indicators were employed to quantitatively evaluate the equity of mental health resources' allocation.By the end of 2018, there were a total of 141 mental health institutions in Hunan Province of China, the bed density was 5.31 beds per 10,000 people, the ratio of doctors to nurses was 2.20, the number of outpatients of mental health institutions was 1288,047 per year. The mental health resources' allocation in terms of demographic dimension were in a preferred status with the Gini values all less than 0.3, and the Gini values for mental health resources`allocation in terms of geographical dimension ranged from 0.24 to 0.35. The Theil index for mental health allocation in terms of demographic dimension was lower than 0.05, and the Theil index for mental health allocation in terms of geographical dimension ranged from 0.04 to 0.11.The shortage of mental health resources is still the priority issue to be increased and optimized by policy-makers in Hunan in the future, especially the human resources. Moreover, the utilization of mental health resources was low though its equity was fair. Policy-makers need to consider the high utilization and geographical accessibility of health resources among different regions to ensure people in different regions could get access to available health services."
https://openalex.org/W4304757177,"The present study was conducted to determine the effect of endurance exercise under low energy availability (EA) on exogenous glucose oxidation during endurance exercise. Ten active males (21.4 ± 0.6 years, 170.4 ± 1.4 cm, 62.4 ± 1.5 kg, 21.5 ± 0.4 kg/m2) completed two trials, consisting of two consecutive days (days 1 and 2) of endurance training under low EA (19.9 ± 0.2 kcal/kg fat free mass [FFM]/day, LEA trial) or normal EA (46.4 ± 0.1 kcal/kg FFM/day, NEA trial). The order of these two trials was randomized with at least a 1-week interval between trials. As an endurance training, participants performed 60 min of treadmill running at 70% of maximal oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) during two consecutive days (on days 1 and 2). On day 1, the endurance training was performed with consumed individually manipulated meals. During the endurance exercise on day 2, exogenous glucose oxidation was evaluated using 13C-labeled glucose, and respiratory gas samples were collected. In addition, blood glucose and lactate concentrations were measured immediately after exercise on day 2. Body composition, blood parameters, and resting respiratory gas variables were evaluated under overnight fasting on days 1 and 2. Body weight was significantly reduced in the LEA trial on day2 (day1: 61.8 ± 1.4 kg, day 2: 61.3 ± 1.4 kg, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between trials in 13C excretion (P = 0.33) and area under the curve during the 60 min of exercise (LEA trial: 40.4 ± 3.1 mmol•60min, NEA trial: 40.4 ± 3.1 mmol•60min, P = 0.99). However, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER, LEA trial: 0.88 ± 0.01, NEA trial: 0.90 ± 0.01) and carbohydrate oxidation (LEA trial: 120.1 ± 8.8 g, NEA trial: 136.8 ± 8.6 g) during endurance exercise showed significantly lower values in the LEA trial than in the NEA trial (P = 0.01 for RER and carbohydrate oxidation). Serum insulin and total ketone body concentrations were significantly changed after a day of endurance training under low EA (P = 0.04 for insulin, P < 0.01 for total ketone). In conclusion, low EA during endurance exercise reduced systemic carbohydrate oxidation; however, exogenous glucose oxidation (evaluated by 13C excretion) remained unchanged during exercise under low EA."

Here, we report on a scoping study to assess the completeness of epidemiological data available for COVID-19 pandemic management in the United States, enumerating authoritative US government estimates of parameters of infectious transmission, infection severity, and disease burden and characterizing the extent and scope of US public health affiliated epidemiological investigations published through November 2021. While we found authoritative estimates for most expected transmission and disease severity parameters, some were lacking, and others had significant uncertainties. Moreover, most transmission parameters were not validated domestically or re-assessed over the course of the pandemic. Publicly available disease surveillance measures did grow appreciably in scope and resolution over time; however, their resolution with regards to specific populations and exposure settings remained limited. We identified 283 published epidemiological reports authored by investigators affiliated with U.S. governmental public health entities. Most reported on descriptive studies. Published analytic studies did not appear to fully respond to knowledge gaps or to provide systematic evidence to support, evaluate or tailor community mitigation strategies. The existence of epidemiological data gaps 18 months after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for more timely standardization of data collection practices and for anticipatory research priorities and protocols for emerging infectious disease epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W4304757227,"Despite the growing body of literature on the influence of industrial agglomeration on urban innovation, no consensus has been reached on the mechanism of the spillover effect. This empirical study exploits heterogeneity in spillover effects between manufacturing and producer service agglomerations on urban innovation based on a sample of 262 prefecture-level cities in China. We find some intriguing and new findings: (1) The threshold effect can be identified for the spillover effect of manufacturing agglomeration but not for that of producer service agglomeration. (2) Manufacturing and producer service agglomerations have opposite decomposition indirect effect. (3) The spatial spillover effect of industrial agglomeration can be restrained by absorptive capacity of nearby cities. This study not only provides empirical evidence for the reconciliation of the debate on the effect of manufacturing and producer service agglomeration, but also has important policy implication for reconsidering the role of industrial agglomeration in urban innovation."
https://openalex.org/W4304758422,"Introduction Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are comprised by a heterogenous group of diagnoses with multifaceted and complex etiologies. Although diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (MSD) have been reported as risk factors for developing TMD, no nationwide population-based registry studies have been conducted to investigate this possible link. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between MSD and TMD in a population-based sample using Swedish registry data, and to further investigate the difference in such association between patients diagnosed with TMD in a hospital setting and patients surgically treated for the condition. Materials and methods Population based case-control study using Swedish nationwide registry data. Data was collected between 1998 and 2016 from 33 315 incident cases and 333 122 controls aged ≥18, matched for sex, age, and living area. Cases were stratified into non-surgical (NS), surgically treated once (ST1) and surgically treated twice or more (ST2). Information on MSD exposure (ICD-10 M00-M99) was collected between 1964 and 2016. Odds ratios were calculated using conditional logistic regression, adjusted for country of birth, educational level, living area, and mental health comorbidity. Results A significant association between MSD and the development of TMD was found for all diagnostic categories: arthropathies (OR 2.0, CI 1.9–2.0); systemic connective tissue disorders (OR 2.3, CI 2.1–2.4); dorsopathies (OR 2.2, CI 2.1–2.2); soft tissue disorders (OR 2.2, CI 2.2–2.3); osteopathies and chondropathies (OR 1.7, CI 1.6–1.8); and other disorders of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (OR 1.9, CI 1.8–2.1). The associations were generally much stronger for TMD requiring surgical treatment. The diagnostic group with the strongest association was inflammatory polyarthropathies, M05-M14 (OR 11.7, CI 8.6–15.9), which was seen in the ST2 group. Conclusions Patients with MSD diagnoses have a higher probability of being diagnosed with TMD, in comparison to individuals without MSD. This association is even stronger for TMD that requires surgery. The results are in line with earlier findings, but present new population-based evidence of a possible causal relationship between MSD and TMD, even after adjusting for known confounders. Both dentists and physicians should be aware of this association and be wary of early signs of painful TMD among patients with MSD, to make early referral and timely conservative treatment possible."

Promoting these technologies will not be successful without an effective data-driven method to identify cutting-edge technologies. This paper proposes a data-driven model for identifying global cutting-edge science technologies based on SpaCy. In this model, we collected data released by 17 well-known American technology media websites from July 2019 to July 2020 using web crawling with Python. We combine graph-based neural network learning with active learning as the research method in this paper. Next, we introduced a ten-fold cross-check to train the model through machine learning with repeated experiments. The experimental results show that this model performed very well in entity recognition tasks with an F value of 98.11%. The model provides an information source for cutting-edge technology identification. It can promote innovations in cutting-edge technologies through its effective identification and tracking and explore more efficient scientific and technological research work modes."
https://openalex.org/W4304775595,"Brain metastasis in breast cancer remains difficult to treat and its incidence is increasing. Therefore, the development of new therapies is of utmost clinical relevance. Recently, toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 was correlated with IL6 expression and poor prognosis in 1 215 breast cancer primaries. In contrast, we demonstrated that TLR4 stimulation reduces microglia-assisted breast cancer cell invasion. However, the expression, prognostic value, or therapeutic potential of TLR signaling in breast cancer brain metastasis have not been investigated. We thus tested the prognostic value of various TLRs in two brain-metastasis gene sets. Furthermore, we investigated different TLR agonists, as well as MyD88 and TRIF-deficient microenvironments in organotypic brain-slice ex vivo co-cultures and in vivo colonization experiments. These experiments underline the ambiguous roles of TLR4, its adapter MyD88, and the target nitric oxide (NO) during brain colonization. Moreover, analysis of the gene expression datasets of breast cancer brain metastasis patients revealed associations of TLR1 and IL6 with poor overall survival. Finally, our finding that a single LPS application at the onset of colonization shapes the later microglia/macrophage reaction at the macro-metastasis brain-parenchyma interface (MMPI) and reduces metastatic infiltration into the brain parenchyma may prove useful in immunotherapeutic considerations."
https://openalex.org/W4304701082,"To investigate the biogas generation characteristics of the organic matter in lignite, methanol extraction was conducted to obtain the soluble fraction and the residual of lignite, which were subsequently taken as the sole carbon source for biogas production by a methanogenic consortium. Afterward, the composition of compounds before and after the fermentation was characterized by UV-Vis, GC-MS, and HPLC-MS analysis. The results indicated that the methanogenic microorganisms could produce H2 and CO2 without accumulating CH4 by utilizing the extract, and the methane production of the residue was 18% larger than that of raw lignite, reaching 1.03 mmol/g. Moreover, the organic compounds in the methanol extract were degraded and their molecular weight was reduced. Compounds such as 1, 6-dimethyl-4-(2-methylethyl) naphthalene, 7-butyl-1-hexylnaphthalene, simonellite, and retene were completely degraded by microorganisms. In addition, both aromatic and non-aromatic metabolites produced in the biodegradation were detected, some of which may have a negative effect on the methanogenesis process. These results revealed the complexity of the interaction between coal and organism from another point of view."
https://openalex.org/W4304701117,"Arbovirus outbreaks in communities are affected by how vectors, hosts and non-competent species interact. In this study, we investigate how ecological interactions between species and epidemiological processes influence the invasion potential of a vector-borne disease. We use an eco-epidemiological model to explore the basic reproduction number R0 for a range of interaction strengths in key processes, using West Nile virus infection to parameterize the model. We focus our analysis on intra and interspecific competition between vectors and between hosts, as well as competition with non-competent species. We show that such ecological competition has non-linear effects on R0 and can greatly impact invasion risk. The presence of multiple competing vector species results in lower values for R0 while host competition leads to the highest values of risk of disease invasion. These effects can be understood in terms of how the competitive pressures influence the vector-to-host ratio, which has a positive relationship with R0. We also show numerical examples of how vector feeding preferences become more relevant in high competition conditions between hosts. Under certain conditions, non-competent hosts, which can lead to a dilution effect for the pathogen, can have an amplification effect if they compete strongly with the competent hosts, hence facilitating pathogen invasion in the community."

Past study findings suggest ACEs contribute to depression, while physical activity alleviates depression. Little is known about the link between ACEs and physical activity as it relates to depression among U.S. adults. This research had a primary objective of determining the role of physical activity within the link between ACEs and depression. The significance of this study involves examining physical activity as a form of behavioral medicine.Data from the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were fit to Pearson chi-square and multivariable logistic regression models to examine the links between ACEs and depression, ACEs and physical activity, and physical activity and depression among U.S. adults ages 18-and-older (n = 117,204) from 21 states and the District of Columbia, while also determining whether physical activity attenuates the association between ACEs and depression.Findings from chi-square analyses indicated that ACEs are related to physical activity (χ2 = 19.4, df = 1; p<0.01) and depression (χ2 = 6,841.6, df = 1; p<0.0001). Regression findings suggest ACEs were linked to depression (AOR = 1.050; 95% CI = 1.049, 1.051). ACEs and physical activity (AOR = 0.994; 95% CI = 0.992, 0.995) and physical activity and depression (AOR = 0.927; 95% CI = 0.922, 0.932) were both inversely related. Physical activity mitigated the link between ACEs and depression (AOR = 0.995; 95% CI = 0.993, 0.996).This research addressed a critical knowledge gap concerning how ACEs and physical activity contribute to depression outcomes among U.S. adults. Findings suggest physical activity mitigates the effect of ACEs on depression. Future studies should apply physical activity interventions to alleviate depression among U.S. adults with high ACEs."
https://openalex.org/W4304701184,"Contrasting with the predominance of blade-based assemblages in the Eurasian Upper Paleolithic, the large-scale persistence of a core-and-flake technology remains one of the defining features of Late Pleistocene lithic technology in East Asia. In North China, Shuidonggou is an exceptional site where both technologies are documented, therefore, it is an important archaeological sequence to understand regional technological evolution during the Marine Isotopic Stage 3. Blade technology first occurred at Shuidonggou Locality 1 and 2 around 41 ka cal BP while core-and-flake assemblages were widespread in North China. However, systematic technological studies on assemblages postdating 34 ka cal BP have not been conducted to examine whether the blade technology appeared and disappeared over a short yet abrupt episode, or persists and integrates into other forms in the region. Here, we conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses to reconstruct lithic productions on the assemblages at Shuidonggou Locality 2, dated after 34 ka cal BP. Our results show that there is a total absence of laminar elements in stone artifacts dated to 34-28 ka cal BP at Shuidonggou. Instead, we observe a dominance of an expedient production of flakes in the younger assemblages, illustrating a rapid return to flake-based technology after a relatively brief episode of stone blade production. Combining archaeological, environmental, and genetic evidence, we suggest that this technological 'reversal' from blades back to core and flake technology reflect population dynamics and adaptive strategies at an ecological interface between East Asian winter and summer monsoon."

Descriptive statistics, One-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation, Independent t-tests, and multiple linear regression were examined.Spirituality, health engagement and attitude toward vaccines, as well as health beliefs constructs (all scores of perceived benefits and barriers) were significant key factors of acceptance of vaccines. Interestingly, the spirituality, attitude toward vaccine, and health beliefs constructs including perceived susceptibility, and benefits indicated a significantly higher willingness.Results demonstrated the utility of spirituality, health engagement, health belief model, and attitudes towards vaccines in understanding acceptance and willingness to pay for a vaccine. Specifically, a key obstacle to the acceptance of and willingness to pay COVID-19 vaccination included a high score of the perceived barrier construct. Moreover, the acceptance of and willingness to pay could be impaired by worries about the side-effects of a COVID-19 vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4304757273,"Reactive balance, a critical automatic movement pattern in response to a perturbation, is directly linked to fall prevention in older adults. Various exercise interventions have been broadly performed to improve reactive balance and thus prevent falls. Curiously, aquatic exercises have been suggested as an effective balance intervention and a safer alternative to exercises on dry land yet the efficacy of aquatic exercises on reactive balance has not been formally investigated. The present clinical trial aims to identify if skills acquired during aquatic exercise are more effectively transferred to a reactive balance task than land exercise. This study is designed as a double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial. Forty-four older adults aged 65 years or above who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomized into an aquatic exercise group or land exercise group. Each group will participate in the same single bout intervention that includes a ball throwing and catching task. A modified lean-and-release test will be implemented on land immediately before, after, and one week after the single bout intervention. The outcomes will include reaction time, rapid response accuracy, and mini-BESTest scores obtained from stepping and grasping reactions. All statistical analyses will be conducted using an intention-to-treat approach. Our conceptual hypothesis is that participants in the aquatic exercise group will demonstrate more improved outcome scores in the lean-and-release test when compared to those in the land exercise group. The results of the present study are expected to provide evidence to support the benefits of aquatic exercises for improving reactive balance in older adults. Further, participants may find aquatic exercises safer and more motivating, thus encouraging them to participate in further aquatic exercise programs."

Information concerning transition from BOS to RAS is limited. We aimed to characterize the lung volume change after BOS diagnosis by computed tomography (CT) volumetry and to determine the incidence, risk factors and clinical significance of BOS to RAS transition.CT volumetry measurements were performed from 63 patients with CLAD initially classified as BOS by CT volumetry. BOS patients with lung volume remaining >85% of baseline were classified as persistent BOS, whereas BOS patients whose lung volume permanently decreased to ≤85% of baseline were classified as BOS to RAS transition.During follow-up (median 9.8 years) eight patients (12.7%) were classified as BOS to RAS transition, which decreased recipient (p = 0.004) and graft survival (p = 0.020) in comparison to patients with persistent BOS. Opacities on chest imaging preceded BOS to RAS transition in 88% of patients. Opacities on chest imaging at BOS diagnosis and early CLAD diagnosis after transplantation were risk factors for transition.Based on lung volume decrease measured by CT volumetry, a small proportion of BOS patients transitioned to RAS which had an adverse effect on recipient and graft survival."

We assessed the carriage of Spn, and its antibiotic resistance patterns, among participants ≥50 years of age living in the city of Novi Sad during the second year of COVID-19 pandemic.Analysis of prospectively collected data among participants with or without symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection who visited their elected physicians in the Primary Health Care Centre of Novi Sad (outpatient facility) was conducted from May 18, 2021 to December 7, 2021. Both nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) samples from each participant were collected.A total of 1042 samples from 521 study subjects (1 NP and 1 OP sample from each person) were collected. Sixteen samples from the same number of persons (3.1%, 95% confidence interval: 1.76%-4.94%) were culture positive for the presence of Spn. Overall, the median age of study participants was 71 years (range, 50-93 years; 90th percentile, 77 years), and most (197/521, 37.8%) of them were 70-79 years of age. A majority of the study subjects were: females (324/521; 62.2%), sampled during May and June 2021 (376/521, 72.2%), those who did not have contact with children aged 0-10 years in the family (403/521; 77.4%), without smokers in the household (443/521; 85.0%), and those who did not receive vaccine against Spn (519/521; 99.6%). Out of 16 Spn positive samples, for six participants, Spn carriage serotypes were obtained and there were four vaccine (6A, 11A, 15B, and 18C) serotypes, and two (6C and 35F) non-vaccine serotypes. Remaining 10 (62.50%) samples were non-typeable isolates of pneumococci. Among four vaccine serotypes, two (6A and 18C) were represented in PCV13, and 18C along with the other two (11A and 15B) in PPSV23 vaccine. The highest level of resistance of Spn isolates was observed for erythromycin, (10 or 62.50%), and tetracycline, (7 or 43.75%), one isolate showed resistance to penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, while none of them were resistant to ceftriaxone, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and levofloxacin. There were three multi-drug resistant isolates; one was identified as 6C (non-vaccine serotype), and two other were non-typeable isolates of Spn.In this first study conducted in Serbia on Spn carriage in adults ≥50 years of age, we found low prevalence of Spn carriage and identified 6 serotypes of Spn, four of which were represented in vaccines. These results may support future Spn colonization studies among middle-aged and older adults."

The 42-questions questionnaire was designed to assess the KAP regarding fluid replacement and urination. The questionnaire included knowledge of fluid replacement (KFR), attitudes of fluid replacement (AFR), knowledge of urination (KU), and attitudes of urination (AU), which were awarded 20 scoring points. Descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's correlation analysis, Multiple linear stepwise regression and Chi-square test were performed.A total of 779 valid questionnaires were collected and the effective rate is 98.4%. We finally conducted an assessment of 646 questionnaires of elite athletes. The mean score for KFR, AFR, KU, and AU was 2.8±1.3, 2.3±0.6, 3.0±1.5, and 2.1±0.8, respectively, with higher scores indicating positive hydration knowledge and attitudes. KFR and AFR scores of winter sports athletes were higher than those of summer sports athletes(P<0.05). Athletes who had lower athletic grades and training years had a worse KFR(P<0.05). Only 31.0% athletes knew that rehydration should be carried out before, during, and after training, which was scarcer among women, lower-athletic grades athletes, or athletes with lower training years (P<0.05). Male athletes had a worse KU but a better AU than female athletes(P<0.05). And athletes who were international-class athletic grades had the highest KU scores(P<0.05). The athletic grades and sport events were the main factors influencing the total scores of knowledge and attitudes (P<0.05, 95% CI -0.789--0.168,95% CI 0.025-1.040). Most of athletes tend to get hydration knowledge from internet. In practices, thirst is the main reason for rehydration (77.9%). The percentages of athletes with normal urine color (42.0%), frequency (75.0%,) and volume (20.0%) were low.These findings indicate that Chinese elite athletes did not have sufficient KAP on fluid replacement and urination, more marked in the individuals who were summer sport events, the lower athletic grades and in lower training years. It is recommended that education should be provided in the early stages of professional training for athletes."

While the causes and consequences of intra-specific synchrony on population size and demographic rates have received considerable attention only a few factors that may affect inter-specific synchrony have been described. We formulate the hypothesis that food subsidies can buffer the influence of environmental stochasticity on community dynamics, disrupting and masking originally synchronized systems. To illustrate this hypothesis, we assessed the consequences of European policies implementation affecting subsidy availability on the temporal synchrony of egg volume as a proxy of breeding investment in two sympatric marine top predators with differential subsidy use. We show how 7-year synchrony appears on egg volume fluctuations after subsidy cessation suggesting that food subsidies could disrupt interspecific synchrony. Moreover, cross correlation increased after subsidy cessation and environmental buffering seems to act during synchronization period. We emphasize that subsidies dynamics and waste management provide novel insights on the emergence of synchrony in natural populations."
https://openalex.org/W4304758078,"Many endophytic fungi have the potential to function as saprotrophs when living host tissues senesce and enter the litter pool. The consumption of plant litter by fungi obviously requires moisture but, in the arid, western USA, the native range of Quercus gambelii Nutt., most of the precipitation occurs during the coldest months of the year. Therefore, we hypothesized that the endophytic fungi of Q. gambelii have the potential to function as psychrotolerant saprotrophs, which we defined in this study as an organism capable of significant growth on leaf litter at 5°C. We further hypothesized that a tradeoff exists between growth of endophytic fungi at 5°C and at 17°C such that fungal isolates are either cold- or warm-temperature specialists. Consistent with our first hypothesis, we found that 36 of our 40 isolates consumed leaf litter at 5°C, but there was a surprisingly high degree of variability among isolates in this ability, even among isolates of a given species. Contrary to our second hypothesis, there was no tradeoff between saprotrophic growth at 5°C and saprotrophic growth at 17°C. Indeed, the isolates that grew poorly as saprotrophs at 5°C were generally those that grew poorly as saprotrophs at 17°C. By virtue of being endophytic, endophytic fungi have priority in litter over decomposer fungi that colonize plant tissues only after they enter the litter pool. Moreover, by virtue of being psychrotolerant, some endophytic fungi may function as saprotrophs during the cold months of the year when moisture is temporarily available. Therefore, we suggest that some endophytic fungi of Q. gambelii could play significant ecosystem roles in litter decomposition and nutrient cycling."
https://openalex.org/W4304758094,"Erect-crested penguins are the least studied of all penguins. They breed on two isolated subantarctic island groups, the Antipodes and Bounty Islands. Sporadic nest counts indicate a dramatic decline in numbers of erect-crested penguins over the last 50 years. Here we present data from a study undertaken in 1998 on the breeding biology, behavior and hormones of erect-crested penguins. It represents, even today, by far the most detailed data available on this species. The penguins exhibited extreme reversed egg-size dimorphism, whereby the first-laid A-egg was much smaller than the second-laid B-egg. A-eggs were lost before (42.3%) or on (37.8%) the day the B-egg was laid, and none survived more than 7 days after that. The penguins were in a low state of reproductive readiness, as evidenced by low levels of copulation, fighting, and testosterone in males during the courtship/laying period when, curiously, plasma levels of testosterone were at least as high in females. The laying interval (5.4 days) is the longest recorded for any penguin species, and incubation was highly variable until clutch completion. Most nests (91.2%) contained no nesting material and eggs were laid directly onto the ground. A-eggs were lost mainly by rolling out of the nest. However, even when prevented from doing so by an experimental manipulation, A-eggs survived no longer than those in control nests. Testosterone levels in males increased after clutch completion, when they remained in attendance at the nest for up to 13 days, despite females assuming most of the incubation duties. The bills of males were significantly larger than those of females and probably help with guarding the nest. We discuss explanations for obligate brood reduction in crested penguins and the options for conservation in light of our census results, which indicate that this enigmatic penguin species could be in trouble."
https://openalex.org/W4304758116,"Objectives Our study aims to investigate the health benefit of regular physical exercise participation on a series of COVID-19 outcomes including COVID-19 morbidity, mortality, and cure rate. Methods Prefecture-level panel data related to physical exercise and the COVID-19 pandemic in China were collected from January 1 to March 17, 2020, (N = 21379). Multiple linear regression was conducted, and the ordinary least squares technique was used to estimate the coefficient. Results It was shown that regular sports participation significantly negatively affected COVID-19 morbidity (estimate = -1.1061, p&lt;0.01) and mortality (estimate = -0.3836, p&lt;0.01), and positively affected cure rate (estimate = 0.0448, p&lt;0.01), implying that engaging in physical exercise regularly does have a significant positive effect on COVID-19 outcomes. Then, we explored the heterogeneity of the effect of physical exercise on areas with different risk levels and it was revealed that the effect of physical exercise was more pronounced in high-risk areas in terms of morbidity (estimate = -1.8776, p&lt;0.01 in high-risk areas; estimate = -0.0037, p&lt;0.01 in low-risk areas), mortality (estimate = -0.3982, p&lt;0.01 in high-risk areas; estimate = -0.3492, p&lt;0.01 in low-risk areas), and cure rate (estimate = 0.0807, p&lt;0.01 in high-risk areas; 0.0193 = -0.0037, p&lt;0.05 in low-risk areas). Conclusions Our results suggest that regularly engaging in physical exercise before the pandemic has positive health effects, especially in the case of a more severe epidemic. Therefore, we urge readers to actively engage in physical exercise so that we can reduce the risks in the event of a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4304758136,"Tuna is one of the most widely consumed fish on the European market, being available in various consumable options. Among them, Thunnus albacares , also called yellowfin tuna, is a delicacy and is consumed by millions of people around the world. Due to its comparatively high cost and demand, it is more vulnerable to fraud, where low-cost tuna or other fish varieties might be replaced for economic gain. In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed and validated for targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene for fast and direct detection of Thunnus albacares , which is a valuable tuna species. The analytical specificity was confirmed using 18 target samples ( Thunnus albacares ) and 18 samples of non-target fish species. The analytical sensitivity of the LAMP assay was 540 fg DNA per reaction. In addition, a simple and direct swab method without time-consuming nucleic acid extraction procedures and the necessity for cost-intensive laboratory equipment was performed that allowed LAMP detection of Thunnus albacares samples within 13 minutes. Due to its high specificity and sensitivity, the LAMP assay can be used as a rapid and on-site screening method for identifying Thunnus albacares , potentially providing a valuable monitoring tool for food authenticity control by the authorities."
https://openalex.org/W4304758274,"Indonesia belongs to endemic areas of Japanese encephalitis (JE), yet data regarding the true risk of disease transmission are lacking. While many seroprevalence studies reported its classic enzootic transmission, data related to the role of bats in the transmission of JE virus are limited. This current study aimed to identify the potential role of bats in the local transmission of the JE virus to aid the ongoing active case surveillance in Indonesia, in order to estimate the transmission risk. Mosquitoes and bats were collected from 11 provinces in Indonesia. The detection of the JE virus used polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Maps were generated to analyze the JE virus distribution pattern. Logistic regression analysis was done to identify risk factors of JE virus transmission. JE virus was detected in 1.4% (7/483) of mosquito pools and in 2.0% (68/3,322) of bat samples. Mosquito species positive for JE virus were Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Cx . vishnui , whereas JE-positive bats belonged to the genera Cynopterus , Eonycteris , Hipposideros , Kerivoula , Macroglossus , Pipistrellus , Rousettus , Scotophilus and Thoopterus . JE-positive mosquitoes were collected at the same sites as the JE-positive bats. Collection site nearby human dwellings (AOR: 2.02; P = 0.009) and relative humidity of &gt;80% (AOR: 2.40; P = 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for JE virus transmission. The findings of the current study highlighted the likely ongoing risk of JE virus transmission in many provinces in Indonesia, and its potential implications on human health."
https://openalex.org/W4304758277,"Health-promoting interventions at workplaces can be effective in modifying lifestyle-related behavioral risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, the interventions are not always successful in the real-world setting, and the evidence for effective strategies to implement the interventions has been limited. We propose a scoping review to identify the topics in need of study and areas for future research on barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of workplace health-promoting interventions.This scoping review will explore these issues from the perspective of supply-side stakeholders, who have a direct role in the implementation of these interventions. An electronic systematic search of MEDLINE (using PubMed), Web of Science, and Scopus databases from 1986 to 2022, in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, will be performed. Supplementary hand searching will be undertaken with reference lists from included articles and consulting with relevant stakeholders. Two authors will be responsible for individually screening the corresponding articles by first reading the titles and abstracts and then the full texts to assess whether they meet the inclusion criteria. Data extraction will be conducted using standardized data collection forms, and data analysis will be aligned to the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR), a determinant framework of factors affecting implementation, using a directed content analysis approach.We will present the findings from this review at national and international conferences and submit them to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. Future workplace interventions will significantly benefit from this comprehensive scoping review to identify factors that enable improvement of the implementation, and the barriers to improvement, of evidence-based health-promoting interventions at workplaces."
https://openalex.org/W4304758453,"For a very long time in the COVID-19 crisis, behavioural change leading to physical distancing behaviour was the only tool at our disposal to mitigate virus spread. In this large-scale naturalistic experimental study we show how we can use behavioural science to find ways to promote the desired physical distancing behaviour. During seven days in a supermarket we implemented different behavioural interventions: (i) rewarding customers for keeping distance; (i) providing signage to guide customers; and (iii) altering shopping cart regulations. We asked customers to wear a tag that measured distances to other tags using ultra-wide band at 1Hz. In total N = 4, 232 customers participated in the study. We compared the number of contacts (< 1.5 m, corresponding to Dutch regulations) between customers using state-of-the-art contact network analyses. We found that rewarding customers and providing signage increased physical distancing, whereas shopping cart regulations did not impact physical distancing. Rewarding customers moreover reduced the duration of remaining contacts between customers. These results demonstrate the feasibility to conduct large-scale behavioural experiments that can provide guidelines for policy. While the COVID-19 crisis unequivocally demonstrates the importance of behaviour and behavioural change, behaviour is integral to many crises, like the trading of mortgages in the financial crisis or the consuming of goods in the climate crisis. We argue that by acknowledging the role of behaviour in crises, and redefining this role in terms of the desired behaviour and necessary behavioural change, behavioural science can open up new solutions to crises and inform policy. We believe that we should start taking advantage of these opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W4304758872,"Genotype × environment (G×E) interaction is an important source of variation in soybean yield, which can significantly influence selection in breeding programs. This study aimed to select superior soybean genotypes for performance and yield stability, from data from multi-environment trials (METs), through GGE biplot analysis that combines the main effects of the genotype (G) plus the genotype-by-environment (G×E) interaction. As well as, through path analysis, determine the direct and indirect influences of yield components on soybean grain yield, as a genotype selection strategy. Eight soybean genotypes from the breeding program of Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (EMBRAPA) were evaluated in field trials using a randomized block experimental design, in an 8 x 8 factorial scheme with four replications in eight different environments of the Cerrado of Northeastern Brazil during two crop seasons. Phenotypic performance data were measured for the number of days to flowering (NDF), height of first pod insertion (HPI), final plant height (FPH), number of days to maturity (NDM), mass of 100 grains (M100) and grain yield (GY). The results revealed that the variance due to genotype, environment, and G×E interaction was highly significant (P &lt; 0.001) for all traits. The ST820RR, BRS 333RR, BRS SambaíbaRR, M9144RR and M9056RR genotypes exhibited the greatest GY stability in the environments studied. However, only the BRS 333RR genotype, followed by the M9144RR, was able to combine good productive performance with high yield stability. The study also revealed that the HPI and the NDM are traits that should be prioritized in the selection of soybean genotypes due to the direct and indirect effects on the GY."
