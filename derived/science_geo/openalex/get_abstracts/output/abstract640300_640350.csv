https://openalex.org/W3106016811,"Present-day galaxies are surrounded by cool and enriched halo gas extending to hundreds of kiloparsecs. This halo gas is thought to be the dominant reservoir of material available to fuel future star formation, but direct constraints on its mass and physical properties have been difficult to obtain. We report the detection of a fast radio burst (FRB 181112) with arcsecond precision, which passes through the halo of a foreground galaxy. Analysis of the burst shows the halo gas has low net magnetization and turbulence. Our results imply predominantly diffuse gas in massive galactic halos, even those hosting active supermassive black holes, contrary to some previous results."
https://openalex.org/W2976436270,"tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) have been defined as a novel class of small noncoding RNAs. tRFs have been reported to be deregulated in cancer, but their biologic function remains to be fully understood. We have identified a new tRF (named tRF3E), derived from mature tRNAGlu, that is specifically expressed in healthy mammary glands but not in breast cancer (BC). Consistently, tRF3E levels significantly decrease in the blood of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive BC reflecting tumor status (control > early cancer > metastatic cancer). tRF3E down-regulation was recapitulated in Δ16HER2 transgenic mice, representing a BC preclinical model. Pulldown assays, used to search for proteins capable to selectively bind tRF3E, have shown that this tRF specifically interacts with nucleolin (NCL), an RNA-binding protein overexpressed in BC and able to repress the translation of p53 mRNA. The binding properties of NCL-tRF3E complex, predicted in silico and analyzed by EMSA assays, are congruent with a competitive displacement of p53 mRNA by tRF3E, leading to an increased p53 expression and consequently to a modulation of cancer cell growth. Here, we provide evidence that tRF3E plays an important role in the pathogenesis of BC displaying tumor-suppressor functions through a NCL-mediated mechanism.-Falconi, M., Giangrossi, M., Elexpuru Zabaleta, M., Wang, J., Gambini, V., Tilio, M., Bencardino, D., Occhipinti, S., Belletti, B., Laudadio, E., Galeazzi, R., Marchini, C., Amici, A. A novel 3'-tRNAGlu-derived fragment acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer by targeting nucleolin."
https://openalex.org/W2976784976,"Germany is ethnically diverse and the social climate is more or less welcoming for different immigrant groups. The social climate can be described by stereotypes of members of the receiving society about immigrant groups, which in turn shape receiving-society members' behavioral tendencies of support or discrimination. We investigated warmth and competence stereotypes about 17 immigrant groups in Germany. Results showed four clusters of immigrant groups in the two-dimensional space of warmth and competence. Groups who immigrated comparatively recently and from regions of conflict (e.g., the Balkans, Northern Africa) were stereotyped most negatively (moderate warmth, low competence). Across groups, path analysis investigated the socio-structural relations proposed by the stereotype content model and the BIAS map for immigrant groups in the German context. In a pre-registered model all hypothesized paths were significant but model fit was not good. Therefore, an exploratory model included additional paths as well as intercorrelations between exogenous variables and error terms. The modified model showed good fit and partly replicated the relations proposed by the BIAS map. Threat predicted warmth, whereas status predicted competence. Warmth predicted active behavioral tendencies and competence predicted passive behavioral tendencies. Additional paths from status to warmth, threat to competence, as well as from warmth to passive behavioral tendencies and competence to active behavioral tendencies were also significant. Thus, findings support receiving-society members' active role in the process of integrating immigrant groups into German society. Based on the results, social-psychological approaches to foster immigrant integration are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2975240215,"Pathogen activation of innate immune pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) stimulates cellular signaling pathways. This often leads to outcomes that contribute to pathogen clearance. Alternatively, activation of specific PRR pathways can aid pathogen survival. The human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is a case in point, employing strategies to escape innate immune recognition and killing by the host. As for other bacteria, PRR-stimulated type I interferon (IFN-I) induction has been proposed as one such immune escape pathway that may favor S. aureus. Cell wall components of S. aureus elicit TLR2-dependent cellular responses, but the exact signaling pathways activated by S. aureus–TLR2 engagement and the consequences of their activation for the host and bacterium are not fully known. We previously showed that TLR2 activates both a cytoplasmic and an endosome-dependent signaling pathway, the latter leading to IFN-I production. Here, we demonstrate that S. aureus infection of human monocytes activates a TLR2-dependent endosomal signaling pathway, leading to IFN-I induction. We mapped the signaling components of this pathway and identified roles in IFN-I stimulation for the Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) adaptor Myd88 adaptor-like (Mal), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and IκB kinase (IKK)-related kinases, but not for TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) and TRAF3. Importantly, monocyte TLR2-dependent endosomal signaling enabled immune escape for S. aureus, because this pathway, but not IFN-I per se, contributed to intracellular bacterial survival. These results reveal a TLR2-dependent mechanism in human monocytes whereby S. aureus manipulates innate immune signaling for its survival in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2977237750,"Longitudinal designs provide a strong inferential basis for uncovering reciprocal effects or causality between variables. For this analytic purpose, a cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) has been widely used in medical research, but the use of the CLPM has recently been criticized in methodological literature because parameter estimates in the CLPM conflate between-person and within-person processes. The aim of this study is to present some alternative models of the CLPM that can be used to examine reciprocal effects, and to illustrate potential consequences of ignoring the issue. A literature search, case studies, and simulation studies are used for this purpose. We examined more than 300 medical papers published since 2009 that applied cross-lagged longitudinal models, finding that in all studies only a single model (typically the CLPM) was performed and potential alternative models were not considered to test reciprocal effects. In 49% of the studies, only two time points were used, which makes it impossible to test alternative models. Case studies and simulation studies showed that the CLPM and alternative models often produce different (or even inconsistent) parameter estimates for reciprocal effects, suggesting that research that relies only on the CLPM may draw erroneous conclusions about the presence, predominance, and sign of reciprocal effects. Simulation studies also showed that alternative models are sometimes susceptible to improper solutions, even when reseachers do not misspecify the model."
https://openalex.org/W2976125873,"Reflectin proteins are widely distributed in reflective structures in cephalopods. However, only in loliginid squids are they and the subwavelength photonic structures they control dynamically tunable, driving changes in skin color for camouflage and communication. The reflectins are block copolymers with repeated canonical domains interspersed with cationic linkers. Neurotransmitter-activated signal transduction culminates in catalytic phosphorylation of the tunable reflectins' cationic linkers; the resulting charge neutralization overcomes coulombic repulsion to progressively allow condensation, folding, and assembly into multimeric spheres of tunable well-defined size and low polydispersity. Here, we used dynamic light scattering, transmission EM, CD, atomic force microscopy, and fluorimetry to analyze the structural transitions of reflectins A1 and A2. We also analyzed the assembly behavior of phosphomimetic, deletion, and other mutants in conjunction with pH titration as an in vitro surrogate of phosphorylation. Our experiments uncovered a previously unsuspected, precisely predictive relationship between the extent of neutralization of a reflectin's net charge density and the size of resulting multimeric protein assemblies of narrow polydispersity. Comparisons of mutants revealed that this sensitivity to neutralization resides in the linkers and is spatially distributed along the protein. Imaging of large particles and analysis of sequence composition suggested that assembly may proceed through a dynamically arrested liquid–liquid phase-separated intermediate. Intriguingly, it is this dynamic arrest that enables the observed fine-tuning by charge and the resulting calibration between neuronal trigger and color in the squid. These results offer insights into the basis of reflectin-based biophotonics, opening paths for the design of new materials with tunable properties."
https://openalex.org/W2994409610,"Immunotherapy shows a promise for treating glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant and immunosuppressive glioma. The mesenchymal phenotype of cancer cells was frequently reported to be associated with their induction of immunosuppression within the cancer microenvironment. Overexpressed insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) promotes GBM cell migration and invasion, and contributes to glioma progression and cancer recurrence and poor survival in GBM. However, whether IGFBP2 can induce immunosuppression in GBM was not reported yet. Thus, the study applied a syngeneic mouse GBM model, human GBM samples, and cancer-immune cell co-culture experiments to investigate the effect of IGFBP2 on GBM exposed immune cells and its association with the mesenchymal induction. We found that IGFBP2 promoted the mesenchymal feature of GBM cells. The inhibition of IGFBP2 relieved immunosuppression by increasing CD8+ T and CD19+ B cells and decreasing CD163+ M2 macrophages. Further, the IGFBP2-promoted immunosuppression was associated with its induction of the mesenchymal feature of GBM cells and the inhibitory phosphorylated FcγRIIB of GBM exposed immune cells. Blocking IGFBP2 suppressed tumor growth and improved survival of tumor bearing mice in the mouse GBM model. These findings support the notion that targeting the IGFBP2 may present an effective immunotherapeutic strategy for mesenchymal GBMs."
https://openalex.org/W2975119747,"The Warburg Effect has emerged as a potential drug target because, in some cancer cell lines, it is sufficient to subvert it in order to kill cancer cells. It has also been shown that the Warburg Effect occurs in innate immune cells upon infection. Innate immune cells play critical roles in the tumour microenvironment but the Warburg Effect is not fully understood in monocytes. Furthermore, it is important to understand the impact of infections on key players in the tumour microenvironment because inflammatory conditions often precede carcinogenesis and mutated oncogenes induce inflammation. We investigated the metabolic programme in the acute monocytic leukaemia cell line, THP-1 in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide, mimicking bacterial infections. We found that stimulation of THP-1 cells by LPS induces a subset of pro-inflammatory chemokines and enhances the Warburg Effect. Surprisingly, perturbation of the Warburg Effect in these cells does not lead to cell death in contrast to what was observed in non-myeloid cancer cell lines in a previous study. These findings indicate that the Warburg Effect and inflammation are activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and may have a profound influence on the microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2975539899,"Feruloyl esterases (EC 3.1.1.73), belonging to carbohydrate esterase family 1 (CE1), hydrolyze ester bonds between ferulic acid (FA) and arabinose moieties in arabinoxylans. Recently, some CE1 enzymes identified in metagenomics studies have been predicted to contain a family 48 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM48), a CBM family associated with starch binding. Two of these CE1s, wastewater treatment sludge (wts) Fae1A and wtsFae1B isolated from wastewater treatment surplus sludge, have a cognate CBM48 domain and are feruloyl esterases, and wtsFae1A binds arabinoxylan. Here, we show that wtsFae1B also binds to arabinoxylan and that neither binds starch. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that wtsFae1B's Kd for xylohexaose is 14.8 μm and that it does not bind to starch mimics, β-cyclodextrin, or maltohexaose. Interestingly, in the absence of CBM48 domains, the CE1 regions from wtsFae1A and wtsFae1B did not bind arabinoxylan and were also unable to catalyze FA release from arabinoxylan. Pretreatment with a β-d-1,4-xylanase did enable CE1 domain-mediated FA release from arabinoxylan in the absence of CBM48, indicating that CBM48 is essential for the CE1 activity on the polysaccharide. Crystal structures of wtsFae1A (at 1.63 Å resolution) and wtsFae1B (1.98 Å) revealed that both are folded proteins comprising structurally-conserved hydrogen bonds that lock the CBM48 position relative to that of the CE1 domain. wtsFae1A docking indicated that both enzymes accommodate the arabinoxylan backbone in a cleft at the CE1–CBM48 domain interface. Binding at this cleft appears to enable CE1 activities on polymeric arabinoxylan, illustrating an unexpected and crucial role of CBM48 domains for accommodating arabinoxylan.

https://openalex.org/W2976324394,"Ascorbic acid was used for the first time to synthesize cellulose nanoparticles (CNP) extracted from okra mucilage. The physical properties of the CNP including their size distribution, and crystalline structures were investigated. The rheological properties of the cellulose nanofluid (CNF) were compared with the bulk okra mucilage and commercial polymer xanthan. The interfacial properties of the CNF at the interface of oil-water (O/W) system were investigated at different concentrations and temperatures. The effects of the interaction between the electrolyte and ultrasonic were determined. Core flooding experiment was conducted at reservoir condition to justify the effect of the flow behaviour and disperse phase behaviour of CNF on additional oil recovery. The performance of the CNF was compared to conventional EOR chemical. The combined method of ultrasonic, weak-acid hydrolysis and nanoprecipitation were effective in producing spherical and polygonal nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 100 nm, increased yield of 51% and preserved crystallinity respectively. The zeta potential result shows that the CNF was stable, and the surface charge signifies long term stability of the fluid when injected into oil field reservoirs. The CNF, okra and xanthan exhibited shear-thinning and pseudoplastic behaviour. The IFT decreased with increase in concentration of CNF, electrolyte and temperature. The pressure drop data confirmed the stability of CNF at 120°C and the formation of oil bank was enough to increase the oil recovery by 20%. CNF was found to be very effective in mobilizing residual oil at high-temperature high-pressure (HTHP) reservoir condition. The energy and cost estimations have shown that investing in ultrasonic-assisted weak-acid hydrolysis is easier, cost-effective, and can reduce energy consumption making the method economically advantageous compared to conventional methods."
https://openalex.org/W2975120536,"Mechanical overloading is a major cause of tendinopathy, but the underlying pathogenesis of tendinopathy is unclear. Here we report that high mobility group box1 (HMGB1) is released to the tendon extracellular matrix and initiates an inflammatory cascade in response to mechanical overloading in a mouse model. Moreover, administration of glycyrrhizin (GL), a naturally occurring triterpene and a specific inhibitor of HMGB1, inhibits the tendon’s inflammatory reactions. Also, while prolonged mechanical overloading in the form of long-term intensive treadmill running induces Achilles tendinopathy in mice, administration of GL completely blocks the tendinopathy development. Additionally, mechanical overloading of tendon cells in vitro induces HMGB1 release to the extracellular milieu, thereby eliciting inflammatory and catabolic responses as marked by increased production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in tendon cells. Application of GL abolishes the cellular inflammatory/catabolic responses. Collectively, these findings point to HMGB1 as a key molecule that is responsible for the induction of tendinopathy due to mechanical overloading placed on the tendon."
https://openalex.org/W2975046285,"Information on how insulin and insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and -2) activate insulin receptors (IR-A and -B) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is crucial for understanding the difference in the biological activities of these peptide hormones. Cryo-EM studies have revealed that insulin uses its binding sites 1 and 2 to interact with IR-A and have identified several critical residues in binding site 2. However, mutagenesis studies suggest that Ile-A10, Ser-A12, Leu-A13, and Glu-A17 also belong to insulin's site 2. Here, to resolve this discrepancy, we mutated these insulin residues and the equivalent residues in IGFs. Our findings revealed that equivalent mutations in the hormones can result in differential biological effects and that these effects can be receptor-specific. We noted that the insulin positions A10 and A17 are important for its binding to IR-A and IR-B and IGF-1R and that A13 is important only for IR-A and IR-B binding. The IGF-1/IGF-2 positions 51/50 and 54/53 did not appear to play critical roles in receptor binding, but mutations at IGF-1 position 58 and IGF-2 position 57 affected the binding. We propose that IGF-1 Glu-58 interacts with IGF-1R Arg-704 and belongs to IGF-1 site 1, a finding supported by the NMR structure of the less active Asp-58–IGF-1 variant. Computational analyses indicated that the aforementioned mutations can affect internal insulin dynamics and inhibit adoption of a receptor-bound conformation, important for binding to receptor site 1. We provide a molecular model and alternative hypotheses for how the mutated insulin residues affect activity.

https://openalex.org/W2977025315,"Worldwide, the ecto-parasitic mite Varroa destructor has been assigned as an important driver of honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony losses. Unlike the subspecies of European origin, the honey bees in some African countries such as Uganda and Ethiopia may not be as threatened or suffer less from mite-infestations. However, only little is known about the factors or traits that enable them to co-exist with the mite without beekeepers’ intervention. Hence, this study was designed to investigate these factors or traits that limit the Varroa mite population in Ethiopian honey bees (Apis mellifera simensis). The study was conducted in the primary honey producing region of Ethiopia, i.e. Tigray. Mite infestation levels were shown to be lower in traditional hives (when compared to framed hives) and when colonies were started up from swarm catching (when compared to colony splitting). However, the influence of the comb cell size on mite infestation was not observed. With respect to the bee biology, the hygienic behavior was shown to be high (pin-test: 92.2% removal in 24 hours) and was negatively correlated with phoretic mite counts (Pearson; r = -0.79; P < 0.01) and mite infestation levels in brood (Pearson; r = -0.46; P < 0.001). Efforts to estimate the Varroa mite reproductive capacity were seriously hampered by an extremely low brood infestation level. From the 133 founder mites found (in 6727 capped brood cells) only 18.80% were capable of producing a reproductive progeny. Failure to produce adult male progeny was unexpectedly high (79.70%). We have suggested a few adaptations to the test protocols allowing to estimate the protective traits of honey bee colonies under very low Varroa pressure. Apart from that, this study demonstrates that the honey bees from Ethiopia are suitable targets to further decipher the genetic predisposition of resistance against V. destructor. It is still unclear to what extent simensis differs from the more common scutellata subspecies."
https://openalex.org/W2975503490,"The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is the causative agent of chytridiomycosis and has been a key driver in the catastrophic decline of amphibians globally. While many strategies have been proposed to mitigate Bd outbreaks, few have been successful. In recent years, the use of probiotic formulations that protect an amphibian host by killing or inhibiting Bd have shown promise as an effective chytridiomycosis control strategy. The North American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is a common carrier of Bd and harbours a diverse skin microbiota that includes lactic acid bacteria (LAB), a microbial group containing species classified as safe and conferring host benefits. We investigated beneficial/probiotic properties: anti-Bd activity, and adhesion and colonisation characteristics (hydrophobicity, biofilm formation and exopolysaccharide-EPS production) in two confirmed LAB (cLAB-Enterococcus gallinarum CRL 1826, Lactococcus garvieae CRL 1828) and 60 presumptive LAB (pLAB) [together named as LABs] isolated from bullfrog skin.We challenged LABs against eight genetically diverse Bd isolates and found that 32% of the LABs inhibited at least one Bd isolate with varying rates of inhibition. Thus, we established a score of sensitivity from highest (BdGPL AVS7) to lowest (BdGPL C2A) for the studied Bd isolates. We further reveal key factors underlying host adhesion and colonisation of LABs. Specifically, 90.3% of LABs exhibited hydrophilic properties that may promote adhesion to the cutaneous mucus, with the remaining isolates (9.7%) being hydrophobic in nature with a surface polarity compatible with colonisation of acidic, basic or both substrate types. We also found that 59.7% of LABs showed EPS synthesis and 66.1% produced biofilm at different levels: 21% weak, 29% moderate, and 16.1% strong. Together all these properties enhance colonisation of the host surface (mucus or epithelial cells) and may confer protective benefits against Bd through competitive exclusion. Correspondence analysis indicated that biofilm synthesis was LABs specific with high aggregating bacteria correlating with strong biofilm producers, and EPS producers being correlated to negative biofilm producing LABs. We performed Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis and demonstrated a higher degree of genetic diversity among rod-shaped pLAB than cocci. Based on the LAB genetic analysis and specific probiotic selection criteria that involve beneficial properties, we sequenced 16 pLAB which were identified as Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus thailandicus, Lactobacillus pentosus/L. plantarum, L. brevis, and L. curvatus. Compatibility assays performed with cLAB and the 16 species described above indicate that all tested LAB can be included in a mixed probiotic formula. Based on our analyses, we suggest that E. gallinarum CRL 1826, L. garvieae CRL 1828, and P. pentosaceus 15 and 18B represent optimal probiotic candidates for Bd control and mitigation."

Given its prevalence as the third leading cause of death in Syria, cancer is likely to be an important health burden among Syrian refugees. Against this background, our aim was to describe the clinical, ethical and policy decision-making experiences of health actors working within the current refugee cancer care system; the impact of refugee cancer care health policies on health care providers and policy makers in this context; and provide suggestions for the way delivery of care should be optimised in a sustained emergency situation.From April-July 2016, we conducted in-depth interviews with 12 purposively sampled health officials and health care workers from the Jordanian Ministry of Health, multilateral donors and international non-governmental organisations. Data were analysed using a framework analysis approach to identify systemic, practical and ethical challenges to optimising care for refugees, through author agreement on issues emerging from the data and those linked more directly to areas of questioning.As has been previously reported, central challenges for policy makers and health providers were the lack of quality cancer prevalence data to inform programming and care delivery for this refugee population, and insufficient health resource allocation to support services. In addition, limited access to international funding for the host country, the absence of long-term funding schemes, and barriers to coordination between institutions and frontline clinicians were seen as key barriers. In this context where economic priorities inevitably drive decision-making on public health policy and individual care provision, frontline healthcare workers and policy makers experienced significant moral distress where duties of care and humanitarian values were often impossible to uphold.Our findings confirm and expand understanding of the challenges involved in resource allocation decisions for cancer care in refugee populations, and highlight these for the particular situation of long term Syrian refugees in Jordan. The insights offered by frontline clinicians and policy makers in this context reveal the unintended personal and moral impact of resource allocation decisions. With many countries facing similar challenges in the provision of cancer care for refugees, the lessons learned from Jordan suggest key areas for policy revision and international investment in developing cancer care policies for refugees internationally."
https://openalex.org/W2975104346,"Raman chemometric urinalysis (Rametrix™) was used to analyze 235 urine specimens from healthy individuals. The purpose of this study was to establish the “range of normal” for Raman spectra of urine specimens from healthy individuals. Ultimately, spectra falling outside of this range will be correlated with kidney and urinary tract disease. Rametrix™ analysis includes direct comparisons of Raman spectra but also principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) models, multivariate statistics, and it is available through GitHub as the Rametrix™ LITE Toolbox for MATLAB®. Results showed consistently overlapping Raman spectra of urine specimens with significantly larger variances in Raman shifts, found by PCA, corresponding to urea, creatinine, and glucose concentrations. A 2-way ANOVA test found that age of the urine specimen donor was statistically significant (p < 0.001) and donor sex (female or male identification) was less so (p = 0.0526). With DAPC models and blind leave-one-out build/test routines using the Rametrix™ PRO Toolbox (also available through GitHub), an accuracy of 71% (sensitivity = 72%; specificity = 70%) was obtained when predicting whether a urine specimen from a healthy unknown individual was from a female or male donor. Finally, from female and male donors (n = 4) who contributed first morning void urine specimens each day for 30 days, the co-occurrence of menstruation was found statistically insignificant to Rametrix™ results (p = 0.695). In addition, Rametrix™ PRO was able to link urine specimens with the individual donor with an average of 78% accuracy. Taken together, this study established the range of Raman spectra that could be expected when obtaining urine specimens from healthy individuals and analyzed by Rametrix™ and provides the methodology for linking results with donor characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2976535162,"Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) have been reported to ameliorate neurological deficits after acute ischemic stroke. As neuregulin 1 (NRG1, or heregulin 1), a growth factor with versatile functions in the central nervous system, has demonstrated protective effects against ischemic brain injuries, we have generated NRG1-overexpressing AdMSCs in order to investigate whether NRG1-AdMSCs could enhance therapeutic benefits of AdMSCs in ischemic stroke. After AdMSCs were infected with adenoviral NRG1, increased NRG1 secretion in NRG1-AdMSCs was confirmed with ELISA. At 1 d after ischemic stroke that was induced by the occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCAo) for 60 min in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, adenoviral NRG1, AdMSCs, NRG1-AdMSCs, or PBS were injected into the striatum and serial neurologic examinations were performed. Administration of NRG1-AdMSCs resulted in significant improvement of functional outcome following stroke compared to AdMSCs- or adenoviral NRG1-treated group, in addition to the reduction in the infarct size evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. When NRG1 expression in the brain was examined by double immunofluorescence to human nuclei (HuNu)/NRG1 and ELISA, NRG1-AdMSCs demonstrated marked increase in NRG1 expression. Moreover, western blot analysis further showed that transplantation of NRG1-AdMSCs significantly increased both endogenous and adenoviral NRG1 expression compared to AdMSCs-treated group. To elucidate molecular mechanisms, NRG1-associated downstream molecules were evaluated by western blot analysis. Expression of ErbB4, a receptor for NRG1, was markedly increased by NRG1-AdMSCs administration, in addition to pMAPK and pAkt, crucial molecules of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling. Taken together, our data suggest that NRG1-AdMSCs can provide excellent therapeutic potential in ischemic stroke by activating NRG1-ErbB4 signaling network."
https://openalex.org/W2976177361,"Background It is well established that Ebola Survivors experience a myriad of physical and psychological sequelae. However, little is known about how they seek care to address their health needs. Our study determines the current healthcare seeking behaviour among Ebola survivors and determines the prevalence, pattern of use and correlates of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) use among Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone. Methods We conducted a nationwide questionnaire survey among a cross-sectional sample of Ebola Survivors in Sierra Leone between January and August 2018. We employed descriptive statistics, chi-square test, Fisher exact two-tailed test and backward stepwise binary regression analysis for data analysis. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Ebola Survivors who participated in our study (n = 358), visited a healthcare provider (n = 308, 86.0%), self-medicated with conventional medicines (n = 255, 71.2%) and visited a private pharmacy outlet (n = 141, 39.4%). Survivors also self-medicated with T&CM products (n = 107, 29.9%), concurrently self-medicated with conventional and T&CM products (n = 62, 17.3%), and visited a T&CM practitioner (n = 41, 11.5%). Almost half of (n = 163, 45.5%) Ebola survivors reported using T&CM treatments for post ebola related symptoms and non-Ebola related symptoms since their discharge from an Ebola treatment centre. Ebola survivors who considered their health to be fair or poor (AOR = 4.08; 95%CI: 2.22–7.50; p<0.01), presented with arthralgia (AOR = 2.52; 95%CI: 1.11–5.69, p = 0.026) and were discharged three years or less (AOR = 3.14; 95%CI: 1.13–8.73, p = 0.028) were more likely to use T&CM. Family (n = 101,62.0%) and friends (n = 38,23.3%) were the common sources of T&CM information. Abdominal pain (n = 49, 30.1%) followed by joint pain (n = 46, 28.2%) and back pain (n = 43, 26.4%) were the most cited post–Ebola indications for T&CM use. More than three-quarters of T&CM users (n = 135, 82.8%) failed to disclose their use of T&CM to their healthcare providers. Conclusion Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone employ a myriad of healthcare options including T&CM in addressing their healthcare needs. Researchers, health policy makers and healthcare providers should be aware of the substantial role of T&CM in the health seeking of survivors, and this topic that should be factored into future research, policy formulation and implementation as well as routine practice regarding Ebola survivors."

The aim of this mixed method cross-sectional study was to estimate the linkage and long-term retention in care of PLWHIV and to identify factors potentially interfering along the HIV-care continuum in southern Mozambique.A home-based semi-structured interview was conducted in 2015 to explore barriers and facilitators to the HIV-care cascade among individuals that had been newly HIV-diagnosed in community testing campaigns in 2010 or 2012. Linkage and long-term retention were estimated retrospectively through client self-reports and clinical records. Cohen's Kappa coefficient was calculated to measure the agreement between participant self-reported and documented cascade outcomes.Among the 112 interviewed participants, 24 (21.4%) did not disclose their HIV-positive serostatus to the interviewer. While 84 (75.0%) self-reported having enrolled in care, only 69 (61.6%) reported still being in-care 3-5 years after diagnosis of which 17.4% reported having disengaged and re-engaged. An important factor affecting optimal continuum in HIV-care was the impact of the fear-based authoritarian relationship between the health system and the patient that could act as both driver and barrier.Special attention should be given to quantify and understand repeated cycles of patient disengagement and re-engagement in HIV-care. Strategies to improve the relationship between the health system and patients are still needed in order to optimally engage PLWHIV for long-term periods."
https://openalex.org/W2976509107,"The alteration of the microbial community in the upper respiratory tract (URT) can contribute to the colonization and invasion of respiratory pathogens. However, there are no studies regarding whether the characteristics of the URT microbiota can be affected by infections in lower respiratory tract (LRT). To elucidate the microbial profiles of the URT during pneumonia, the oral, nasal, and lung microbiota was evaluated at the early phase in a murine pneumonia model by direct intratracheal inoculation of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The meta 16S rRNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after K. pneumoniae inoculation presented alterations in the beta diversity of the microbes, but not in the alpha diversity. At this point, a significant increase in microbial alpha diversity was observed in the oral cavity, but not in the nasal cavity. The significant increase was observed in the family Carnobacteriaceae and family Enterococcaceae. These results suggest that characterizing the microbial community of the respiratory tract may not just involve a simple downstream relationship from the URT to the LRT. The health status of the LRT may influence the oral microbiota. Thus, evaluation of the oral microbiota may contribute towards monitoring lung health; the oral microbiota may act as a diagnostic marker of pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2976736893,"Objective The purpose of this study was the assessment of volumetric CT-perfusion (CTP) of the lower leg musculature in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower extremities, comparing it with established angiographic and hemodynamic parameters. Materials and methods Thirty-five consecutive patients with symptomatic PAD of the lower extremities requiring interventional revascularization were assessed prospectively. All patients underwent a CTP scan of the lower leg, and hemodynamic and angiographic assessment. Hemodynamic parameters, specifically ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI), ankle blood pressure (ABP), peak systolic velocity (PSV), and segmental pulse oscillography (SPO) level, were determined. Lesion length and degree of collateralization were assessed by interventional angiography. CTP parameters were calculated with a perfusion software, acting on a no outflow assumption. A sequential two-compartment model was used. Differences in CTP parameters and correlations between CTP, hemodynamic and angiographic parameters were assessed with non-parametric tests. Results The cohort consisted of 27 subjects with an occlusion, and eight with a high-grade stenosis. The mean blood flow (BF) was 7.71 ± 2.96 ml/100ml*min-1, mean blood volume (BV) 0.71 ± 0.33 ml/100ml, and mean mean transit time (MTT) 7.22 ± 2.66 s. BF and BV were higher in subjects with longer lesions, and BV was higher in subjects with lower ABI. Significant correlations were found between lesion length and BV (r = 0.65) and BF (r = 0.52). Significant inverse correlations were found between BV and ABI and between BV and ABP (r = -0.56, for both correlations). Conclusions In our study, we have shown the feasibility of CTP for the assessment of PAD. In the future, this quantitative method might serve as a non-invasive method, possibly complementing the diagnostic workup of patients with peripheral arterial disease."
https://openalex.org/W2977154009,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is generated by proteolytic cleavage of a prodomain from the proBDNF precursor either intracellularly by furin-like proteases or extracellularly by plasmin or matrix metalloproteinases. ProBDNF carries a single N-glycosylation sequon (Asn-127) that remains virtually unstudied despite being located in a highly conserved region proximal to the proteolytic site. To study the proBDNF structure and function, here we expressed the protein and its nonglycosylated N127Q mutant in HEK293F cells. We found that mutation of the Asn-127 prevents intracellular maturation and secretion, an effect reproduced in WT proBDNF by tunicamycin-induced inhibition of N-glycosylation. Absence of the N-glycan did not affect the kinetics of proBDNF cleavage by furin in vitro, indicating that effects other than a direct furin–proBDNF interaction may regulate proBDNF maturation. Using an optimized LC-MS/MS workflow, we demonstrate that secreted proBDNF is fully glycosylated and carries rare N-glycans terminated by GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-R (LacdiNAc) extensively modified by terminal sulfation. We and others noted that this type of glycosylation is protein-specific, extends to proBDNF expressed in PC12 cells, and implies the presence of interacting partners that recognize this glycan epitope.

https://openalex.org/W2975161184,"Background Cirrhosis can alter several metabolic pathways. Metabolomics could prognosticate outcomes like hepatic encephalopathy (HE), transplant, hospitalization and death. Aim Determine changes in serum and urine metabolomics in cirrhotics who develop outcomes. Methods Cirrhotic outpatients underwent data, serum/urine collection and were followed for 90 days. Demographics, cirrhosis details and medications were collected. Metabolomics was performed on urine/serum using GC/MS with subsequent bioinformatics analyses (ChemRICH, MetaMAPP and PLS-DA). Logistic regression adjusting for covariates (demographics, alcohol etiology, prior HE, PPI, SBP prophylaxis, rifaximin/lactulose) were performed and ROC curves comparing MELD to adjusted serum & urine metabolites were created. Results 211 patients gave serum, of which 64 were hospitalized, 19 developed HE, 13 were transplanted and 11 died. 164 patients gave urine of which 56 were hospitalized, 18 developed HE, 12 were transplanted and 11 died. Metabolomics: Saturated fatty acids, amino acids and bioenergetics-related metabolites differentiated patients with/without outcomes. After regression, 232, 228, 284 and 229 serum metabolites were significant for hospitalization, HE, death and transplant. In urine 290, 284, 227 & 285 metabolites were significant for hospitalization, HE, death and transplant respectively. AUC was higher for serum metabolites vs MELD for HE (0.85 vs.0.76), death (0.99 vs.0.88), transplant (0.975 vs.0.94) and hospitalizations (0.84 vs.0.83). Similarly, urinary metabolite AUC was also higher than MELD for HE (0.87 vs.0.72), death (0.92 vs 0.86), transplant (0.99 vs.0.90) and hospitalizations (0.89 vs.0.84). Conclusions In this exploratory study, serum and metabolites focused on lipid, bioenergetics and amino acid metabolism are altered in cirrhotics who develop negative outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2976270343,"Angiostrongyliasis is a parasitic disease caused by nematodes of the genus Angiostrongylus. Distribution of this worm corresponds to the dispersal of its main intermediate host, the giant African land snail Achatina fulica. Genetic characterization can help identify parasitic pathogens and control the spreading of disease. The present study describes infection of A. fulica by Angiostrongylus, and provides a genetic outlook based on sequencing of specific regions. We collected 343 land snails from 22 provinces across six regions of Thailand between May 2017 and July 2018. Artificial digestion and Baermann’s technique were employed to isolate Angiostrongylus larvae. The worm and its intermediate host were identified by sequencing with specific nucleotide regions. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to evaluate the relationship with other isolates. A. fulica from Chaiyaphum province was infected with A. cantonensis, whereas snails collected from Phrae and Chiang Rai provinces were infected with A. malaysiensis. The maximum likelihood tree based on 74 A. fulica COI sequences revealed monophyletic groups and identified two haplotypes: AF1 and AF2. Only AF1, which is distributed in all regions of Thailand, harbored the larvae of A. cantonensis and A. malaysiensis. Two mitochondrial genes (COI and cytb) and two nuclear regions (ITS2 and SSU rRNA) were sequenced in 41 Angiostrongylus specimens. The COI gene indicated that A. cantonensis was closely related to the AC10 haplotype; whereas the cytb gene revealed two new haplotypes: AC19 and AC20. SSU rRNA was useful for the identification of A. cantonensis; whereas ITS2 was a good genetic marker for differentiating between A. cantonensis and A. malaysiensis. This study provides genetic information about the parasite Angiostrongylus and its snail intermediate host. The data in this work may be useful for further study on the identification of Angiostrongylus spp., the genetic relationship between intermediate host and parasite, and control of parasites."

Firstly, a multi-agent genetic algorithm (MAGA) is proposed. During the process, a multi-agent grid environment is constructed based on characteristics of multi-agent systems and genetic algorithm (GA), and a corresponding neighbor interaction operator, a mutation operator based on neighborhood structure and a self-learning operator are designed. Then, combining tabu search algorithm with a MAGA, the algorithm MAGATS are presented. Finally, 43 benchmark instances are tested with the new algorithm. Compared with four other algorithms, the optimization performance of it is analyzed based on obtained test results. Effectiveness of the new algorithm is verified by analysis results."
https://openalex.org/W2975593799,"PCR inhibition is frequent in medical microbiology routine practice and may lead to false-negative results; however there is no consensus on how to detect it. Pathogen-specific and human gene amplifications are widely used to detect PCR inhibition. We aimed at comparing the value of PCR inhibitor detection using these two methods. We analysed Cp shifts (ΔCp) obtained from qPCRs targeting either the albumin gene or the pathogen-specific sequence used in two laboratory-developed microbiological qPCR assays. 3152 samples including various matrixes were included. Pathogen-specific amplification and albumin qPCR identified 62/3152 samples (2.0%), and 409/3152 (13.0%) samples, respectively, as inhibited. Only 16 samples were detected using both methods. In addition, the use of the Youden's index failed to determine adequate Cp thresholds for albumin qPCR, even when we distinguished among the different sample matrixes. qPCR targeting the albumin gene therefore appears not adequate to identify the presence of PCR inhibitors in microbiological PCR assays. Our data may be extrapolated to other heterologous targets and should discourage their use to assess the presence of PCR inhibition in microbiological PCR assays."

This resulted in a median calculated cost of US$477 per manuscript or US$1,908 per person, per year.To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the cost of manuscript formatting in scientific publishing. Our results suggest that scientific formatting represents a loss of 52 hours, costing the equivalent of US$1,908 per researcher per year.

https://openalex.org/W2975865866,"Paraquat (PQ), one of the most widely used herbicides worldwide, causes severe toxic effects in humans and animals. 1-methylhydantoin (MH) is an active ingredient of Ranae Oviductus, which has broad pharmacological activities, e.g., eliminating reactive oxygen species and inhibiting inflammation. This study investigated the effects of MH on lung injury induced by PQ. A PQ poisoning model was established by intragastric infusion of PQ (25 mg/kg), and the control group was simultaneously gavaged with the same dose of saline. The MH group was intraperitoneally injected with 100 mg/kg once per day after intragastric infusion of PQ (25 mg/kg) for five consecutive days. All animals were sacrificed on the sixth day, and the lung tissues were dissected for metabolomics analysis. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, TNF-α and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were determined according to the instructions of the detection kit. Compared with that in the control group, the content of LDH, TNF-α and MDA in the lung tissue of the PQ group was significantly higher, and the activity of SOD in the lung tissue was significantly lower (all p<0.05). Compared with that in the control group, the content of LDH, TNF-α and MDA in the MH group was significantly higher, and the activity of SOD was significantly lower (all p<0.05). However, the differences in SOD activity, LDH activity between the PQ and MH groups were not statistically significant (all p > 0.05). There were significant differences in MDA and TNF-α content between the PQ group and MH group (all p<0.05). MH decreased the production of malondialdehyde and TNF-α to protect against the lung injury caused by PQ poisoning, but it had no significant effect on the activity of LDH and SOD. There were significant differences in metabolomics between the MH group and the PQ poisoning group, primarily in bile acid biosynthesis and metabolism of cholesterol, nicotinate, nicotinamide, alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glycine, threonine, serine, phenylalanine and histidine. Therefore, this study highlights that MH has non-invasive mechanisms and may be a promising tool to treat lung injury induced by PQ poisoning."
https://openalex.org/W2976483416,"Collapse of the lateral cerebral ventricles after ventriculo-peritoneal drainage is a fatal complication in dogs with internal hydrocephalus. It occurs due to excessive outflow of cerebrospinal fluid into the peritoneal cavity (overshunting). In most shunt systems, one-way valves with different pressure settings regulate flow into the distal catheter to avoid overshunting. The rationale for the choice of an appropriate opening pressure is a setting at the upper limit of normal intracranial pressure in dogs. However, physiological intraventricular pressure in normal dogs vary between 5 and 12 mm Hg. Furthermore, we hypothesise that intraventricular pressure in hydrocephalic dogs might differ from pressure in normal dogs and we also consider that normotensive hydrocephalus exists in dogs, as in humans. In order to evaluate intraventricular pressure in hydrocephalic dogs, twenty-three client owned dogs with newly diagnosed communicating internal hydrocephalus were examined before implantation of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt using a single use piezo-resistive strain-gauge sensor (MicroSensor ICP probe). Ventricular volume and brain volume were measured before surgery, based on magnetic resonance images. Total ventricular volume was calculated and expressed in relation to the total volume of the brain, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem (ventricle-brain index). Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the influence of the covariates ""age"", ""gender"", ""duration of clinical signs"", ""body weight"", and ""ventricle-brain index"" on intraventricular pressure. The mean cerebrospinal fluid pressure in the hydrocephalic dogs was 8.8 mm Hg (standard deviation 4.22), ranging from 3-18 mm Hg. The covariates ""age"", (P = 0.782), ""gender"" (P = 0.162), ""body weight"", (P = 0.065), or ventricle-brain index (P = 0.27)"" were not correlated with intraventricular pressure.

https://openalex.org/W2976580427,"The therapeutic options for advanced gastric cancer are still limited. Several drugs targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor family have been developed. So far, the HER2 antibody trastuzumab is the only drug targeting the HER-family that is available to gastric cancer patients. The pan-HER inhibitor afatinib is currently investigated in clinical trials and shows promising results in cell culture experiments and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. However, some cell lines do not respond to afatinib treatment. The determination of resistance factors in these cell lines can help to find the best treatment option for gastric cancer patients. In this study, we analyzed the role of MET as a resistance factor for afatinib therapy in a gastric cancer cell line. MET expression in afatinib-resistant MET-amplified Hs746T cells was reduced by means of siRNA transfection. The effects of MET knockdown on signal transduction, cell proliferation and motility were examined. In addition to the manual assessment of cell motility, a computational motility analysis involving parameters such as (approximate) average speed, displacement entropy or radial effectiveness was realized. Moreover, the impact of afatinib was compared between MET knockdown cells and control cells. MET knockdown in Hs746T cells resulted in impaired signal transduction and reduced cell proliferation and motility. Moreover, the afatinib resistance of Hs746T cells was reversed after MET knockdown. Therefore, the amplification of MET is confirmed as a resistance factor in gastric cancer cells. Whether MET is a useful resistance marker for afatinib therapy or other HER-targeting drugs in patients should be investigated in clinical trials."

The primary Endpoint was the proportion of patients with undetectable viremia (VL<50 copies/mL) after 48 weeks. The planned sample size for this trial was 350 patients.In 3 years, 53 patients were screened and 46 enrolled: 22 randomized to raltegravir and 24 to darunavir/r; 7 patients were excluded, 4 because of a VL >500,000 copies/mL and 3 for HLAB5701 positivity. The snapshot analysis at 48 weeks showed a virologic success of 77.3% in raltegravir and 66.7% in darunavir/r. Time to starting treatment was 34.5 days in raltegravir and 53 days in darunavir/r. At the as treated analysis, the median CD4 counts at 48 weeks was 297 cells/μL in raltegravir and 239 cells/μL in darunavir/r. No difference in total cholesterol, while triglycerides were higher in the darunavir/r arm. No statistical analyses were performed due to the low number of patients enrolled.Late presenter patients are frequent but very difficult to enroll in clinical trials, especially in western countries.

https://openalex.org/W2975365597,"Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are predisposed to several diabetes-related complications. Dysregulation of the haemostatic mechanisms have been implicated. There are however no current studies assessing the levels and activity of protein C (PC), protein S (PS), and antithrombin III (AT III), which are essential in haemostatic regulation, in a single cohort of T2DM patients. This study evaluated the effect of poorly-managed T2DM on the levels and activity of PC, PS, and AT III. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Diabetes Clinic, Cocoa Clinic in Kumasi, Ghana. A total of 242 T2DM patients, comprising 152 patients with poorly-managed diabetes and 90 well-managed diabetes patients, were recruited for the study. Fasting blood glucose, liver function tests and lipid profile were performed for each respondent. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was estimated by turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay. The levels and activity of PC, PS and AT III were measured by solid phase sandwich ELISA method. Results There was a negative correlation between HbA1c and the levels and activity of PC, PS and AT III. The levels and activity of PC [(5.78 vs 4.64 μg/ml, p<0.0001) and (42.22 vs 36.21 U/ml, p = 0.01) respectively], PS [(22.55 vs 20.29 μg/ml, p = 0.010) and (235.94 vs 211.67 U/ml, p<0.0001) respectively] and AT III [(16.28 vs 14.41μg/ml, p<0.0001) and (176.01 vs 160.09 U/ml, p = 0.03) respectively] were significantly increased in patients with well-managed T2DM compared to the poorly-managed diabetes patients. Likewise, the levels and activity of PC, PS, and AT III was higher among T2DM patients using statins than patients who were statin-naïve. Among patients with well-managed T2DM, those who were on statins had significantly higher levels and activities of PC, PS, and AT III compared to well-managed T2DM patients not on statins. However, there no statistically significant differences between the level and activity of PC, PS, and AT III among poorly-managed T2DM patients with respect to statin status. Conclusion Poorly-managed type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with reduced levels and activity of PC, PS and AT III compared to well-managed T2DM. Though use of statins may improve the levels and activity of the PC, PS and AT III in T2DM, their effect is limited in the presence of poorly-controlled T2DM. Proper management of diabetes is essential to reduce the likelihood of thrombotic events among T2DM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2977008234,"Purpose To provide population-based reference values for cervical spinal canal parameters and vertebral body (VB) width and to study their associations with sex, age, body height, body weight and body mass index (BMI) using MRI. Methods Cross-sectional analyses included data from 2,453 participants, aged 21–89 years, of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) who underwent whole-body MRI at 1.5 Tesla between July 2008 and March 2011. A standardised reading was performed for the C2-C7 cervical spine levels at sagittal T2 TSE weighted sequences. Results Reference intervals for spinal canal parameters were similar in males and females, while VB width was on average 2.1–2.2 mm larger in males. Age effects were only substantial regarding VB width with a 0.5 mm per ten-year age increase. Body height effects were only substantial regarding the osseous spinal canal and VB width. Body weight and BMI effects are mostly not substantial. Conclusions Our study provides MRI-based reference values for the cervical spinal canal parameters in an adult Caucasian population. Except for VB width, associations with sex, age and somatometric measures are mostly small and thus have only limited clinical implications. Some available cut-off values may need a revision because they likely overestimate risks."
https://openalex.org/W2977144409,"In the absence of constraints, preference for larger mates is expected to evolve, as larger individuals are typical of higher potential fitness. Large females are often more fecund and carry larger eggs (which result in higher number and better quality of offspring), whereas large males usually have more conspicuous ornaments and are better at defending resources. However, intrasexual competition can constrain the access to larger partners, especially when opportunities for mate takeover abound. Here we investigate the relationship between individual’s size and mate choice in relation to one’s own size and their respective mate’s size using the sailfin tetra, a sexually dimorphic Amazonian fish species. We show that ornaments of larger males are exponentially more conspicuous, and larger females are more fecund and carry larger eggs. Contrary to expectation, neither males nor females associated for longer with the larger of two offered potential mates. Instead, individuals of both genders chose opposite-sex individuals of similar sizes to themselves. Additionally, similar-sized pairs were more likely to spawn than couples with higher size asymmetries. Grounded on field observations, we propose that prudent choice should be particularly important in this system, since courtship is long (often taking several days), which offers opportunities for mate takeover. Intrasexual competition, however, cannot readily explain female choice for similar-sized males. We thus suggest that such preference might be best explained by avoidance of filial cannibalism."
https://openalex.org/W2976052519,"Observational studies have demonstrated that de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy is independently associated with lower mortality. This most probably results from confounding by indication. Reaching clinical stability is associated with the decision to de-escalate and with survival. However, studies rarely adjust for this confounder. We quantified the potential confounding effect of clinical stability on the estimated impact of de-escalation on mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Data were used from the Community-Acquired Pneumonia immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. We performed Cox proportional-hazards regression with de-escalation as time-dependent variable and adjusted for baseline characteristics using propensity scores. The potential impact of unmeasured confounding was quantified through simulating a variable representing clinical stability on day three, using data on prevalence and associations with mortality from the literature. Of 1,536 included patients, 257 (16.7%) were de-escalated, 123 (8.0%) were escalated and in 1156 (75.3%) the antibiotic spectrum remained unchanged. Crude 30-day mortality was 3.5% (9/257) and 10.9% (107/986) in the de-escalation and continuation groups, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio of de-escalation for 30-day mortality (compared to patients with unchanged coverage), without adjustment for clinical stability, was 0.39 (95%CI: 0.19–0.79). If 90% to 100% of de-escalated patients were clinically stable on day three, the fully adjusted hazard ratio would be 0.56 (95%CI: 0.27–1.12) to 1.04 (95%CI: 0.49–2.23), respectively. The simulated confounder was substantially stronger than any of the baseline confounders in our dataset. Quantification of effects of de-escalation on patient outcomes without proper adjustment for clinical stability results in strong negative bias. This study suggests the effect of de-escalation on mortality needs further well-designed prospective research to determine effect size more accurately."

Predictive equations tested included the modified Atwater (MA equation), NRC 2006 equations using both crude fibre (NRC 2006cf) and total dietary fibre (NRC 2006tdf), and new equations reported in the most recent study assessing ME predictive equations (Hall equations; PLoS ONE 8(1): e54405). Where appropriate, equations were tested using both predicted gross energy (GE) and GE measured by bomb calorimetry. Associations between measured and predicted ME were compared with Deming regression, whilst agreement was assessed with Bland-Altman plots. 335 feeding trials were included, comprising 207 canine (182 dry food; 25 wet food) and 128 feline trials (104 dry food, 24 wet food). Predicted ME was positively associated with measured ME whatever the equation used (P<0.001 for all). Agreement between predicted and actual ME was worst for the MA equation, for all food types, with evidence of both a systematic bias and proportional errors evident for all food types. The NRC 2006cf and Hall equations were intermediate in performance, whilst the NRC 2006tdf equations performed best especially when using measured rather than predicted GE, with the narrowest 95% limits of agreement, minimal bias and proportional error. In conclusion, when predicting ME content of pet food, veterinarians, nutritionists, pet food manufacturers and regulatory bodies are strongly advised to use the NRC 2006tdf equations and using measured rather than predicted GE."
https://openalex.org/W2976808286,"Background Excess weight gain throughout adulthood can lead to adverse clinical outcomes and are influenced by complex factors that are difficult to measure in free-living individuals. Metabolite profiling offers an opportunity to systematically discover new predictors for weight gain that are relatively easy to measure compared to traditional approaches. Methods and results Using baseline metabolite profiling data of middle-aged individuals from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS; n = 1,508), we identified 42 metabolites associated (p < 0.05) with longitudinal change in body mass index (BMI). We performed stepwise linear regression to select 8 of these metabolites to build a metabolite risk score (MRS) for predicting future weight gain. We replicated the MRS using data from the Mexico City Diabetes Study (MCDS; n = 768), in which one standard deviation increase in the MRS corresponded to ~0.03 increase in BMI (kg/m2) per year (i.e. ~0.09 kg/year for a 1.7 m adult). We observed that none of the available anthropometric, lifestyle, and glycemic variables fully account for the MRS prediction of weight gain. Surprisingly, we found the MRS to be strongly correlated with baseline insulin sensitivity in both cohorts and to be negatively predictive of T2D in MCDS. Genome-wide association study of the MRS identified 2 genome-wide (p < 5 × 10−8) and 5 suggestively (p < 1 × 10−6) significant loci, several of which have been previously linked to obesity-related phenotypes. Conclusions We have constructed and validated a generalizable MRS for future weight gain that is an independent predictor distinct from several other known risk factors. The MRS captures a composite biological picture of weight gain, perhaps hinting at the anabolic effects of preserved insulin sensitivity. Future investigation is required to assess the relationships between MRS-predicted weight gain and other obesity-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2975351739,"Golden alga Prymnesium parvum Carter is a euryhaline, ichthyotoxic haptophyte (Chromista). Because of its presumed coastal/marine origin where SO42- levels are high, the relatively high SO42- concentration of its brackish inland habitats, and the sensitivity of marine chromists to sulfur deficiency, this study examined whether golden alga growth is sensitive to SO42- concentration. Fluoride is a ubiquitous ion that has been reported at higher levels in golden alga habitat; thus, the influence of F- on growth also was examined. In low-salinity (5 psu) artificial seawater medium, overall growth was SO42—dependent up to 1000 mg l-1 using MgSO4 or Na2SO4 as source; the influence on growth rate, however, was more evident with MgSO4. Transfer from 5 to 30 psu inhibited growth when salinity was raised with NaCl but in the presence of seawater levels of SO42-, these effects were fully reversed with MgSO4 as source and only partially reversed with Na2SO4. Growth inhibition was not observed after acute transfer to 30 psu in a commercial sea salt mixture. In 5-psu medium, F- inhibited growth at all concentrations tested. These observations support the hypothesis that spatial differences in SO42- –but not F-–concentration help drive the inland distribution and growth of golden alga and also provide physiological relevance to reports of relatively high Mg2+ concentrations in golden alga habitat. At high salinity, however, the ability of sulfate to maintain growth under osmotic stress was weak and overshadowed by the importance of Mg2+. A mechanistic understanding of growth responses of golden alga to SO42-, Mg2+ and other ions at environmentally relevant levels and under different salinity scenarios will be necessary to clarify their ecophysiological and evolutionary relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2976117489,"Open data science and algorithm development competitions offer a unique avenue for rapid discovery of better computational strategies. We highlight three examples in computational biology and bioinformatics research in which the use of competitions has yielded significant performance gains over established algorithms. These include algorithms for antibody clustering, imputing gene expression data, and querying the Connectivity Map (CMap). Performance gains are evaluated quantitatively using realistic, albeit sanitized, data sets. The solutions produced through these competitions are then examined with respect to their utility and the prospects for implementation in the field. We present the decision process and competition design considerations that lead to these successful outcomes as a model for researchers who want to use competitions and non-domain crowds as collaborators to further their research."
https://openalex.org/W2975036852,"During resections of brain tumors, neurosurgeons have to weigh the risk between residual tumor and damage to brain functions. Different perspectives on these risks result in practice variation. We present statistical methods to localize differences in extent of resection between institutions which should enable to reveal brain regions affected by such practice variation.Synthetic data were generated by simulating spheres for brain, tumors, resection cavities, and an effect region in which a likelihood of surgical avoidance could be varied between institutions. Three statistical methods were investigated: a non-parametric permutation based approach, Fisher's exact test, and a full Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model. For all three methods the false discovery rate (FDR) was determined as a function of the cut-off value for the q-value or the highest density interval, and receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves were created. Sensitivity to variations in the parameters of the synthetic model were investigated. Finally, all these methods were applied to retrospectively collected data of 77 brain tumor resections in two academic hospitals.Fisher's method provided an accurate estimation of observed FDR in the synthetic data, whereas the permutation approach was too liberal and underestimated FDR. AUC values were similar for Fisher and Bayes methods, and superior to the permutation approach. Fisher's method deteriorated and became too liberal for reduced tumor size, a smaller size of the effect region, a lower overall extent of resection, fewer patients per cohort, and a smaller discrepancy in surgical avoidance probabilities between the different surgical practices. In the retrospective patient data, all three methods identified a similar effect region, with lower estimated FDR in Fisher's method than using the permutation method.Differences in surgical practice may be detected using voxel statistics. Fisher's test provides a fast method to localize differences but could underestimate true FDR. Bayesian MCMC is more flexible and easily extendable, and leads to similar results, but at increased computational cost."

https://openalex.org/W2976631010,"This paper brings advances in weather data collection and modeling, and developments in socioeconomic climate microsimulations to bear on the analysis of the implications of climate change (CC) in the design of public policies to combat food insecurity. It uses new downscaled predictions of future climate in 2050, derived from three Earth System Models calibrated with a new historical weather station dataset for Peru. This climate data is used in a three-stage socioeconomic microsimulation model that includes climate risk, and deals with the endogeneity of incomes and simultaneity of expected food consumption and its variability. We estimate the impact of CC on agricultural yields, and find results consistent and fully bounded within what the global simulations literature has found, with yields falling up to 13% in some regions. However, we show that these drops (and increases) in yields translate to much smaller changes in food consumption, and also surprisingly, to very minor impacts on vulnerability to food insecurity. The document explores what explains this surprising result, showing that in addition to characteristics that are specific to Peru, there are household and market mediating mechanisms that are available in all countries, which explain how changes in yields, and corresponding farm incomes have a reduced impact in vulnerability to food insecurity. Finally, in light of these findings, we explore which policies might have greater impact in reducing food insecurity in contexts of hunger prevalence."

Sixty percent of respondents perceived FIFA officials as being dishonest, and people from countries with less institutional corruption and stronger rule of law perceived FIFA officials as being more corrupt and less competent running the tournament than people from countries with more corruption and weaker rule of law. In contrast, respondents evaluated players as skilled and honest and match officials as competent and honest. We discuss the implications of our findings for perceptions of corruption in general."
https://openalex.org/W2976197179,"Chloroplast plays an important role in the plant life cycle. However, the details of its development remain elusive in rice. In this study, we report the fine-mapping of a novel rice gene wpb1 (white panicle branch 1), which affects chloroplast biogenesis, from a tropical japonica variety that results in an albino panicle branches at and after the heading stage. The wpb1 variety was crossed with Nipponbare to generate the F2 and BC1F2 populations. Green and white panicle branch phenotypes with a 3:1 segregation ratio was observed in the F2 population. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) based on whole genome resequencing was conducted to determine the wpb1 locus. A candidate interval spanning from 11.35 to 23.79M (physical position) on chromosome 1 was identified. The results of BSA analysis were verified by a 40K rice SNP-array using the BC1F2 population. A large-scale F2 population was used to pinpoint wpb1, and the locus was further narrowed down to a 95-kb interval. Furthermore, our results showed that the expression levels of the majority of the genes involved in Chl biosynthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development were remarkably affected in wpb1 variety and in F2 plants with a white panicle branch phenotype. In line with the results mentioned above, anatomical structural examination and chlorophyll (Chl) content measurement suggested that wpb1 might play an important role in the regulation of chloroplast development. Further cloning and functional characterization of the wpb1 gene will shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying chloroplast development in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2975230938,"Starting your own academic lab is a wonderful opportunity to impact science through research and trainee mentoring. In this article, we share some thoughts and resources for this undertaking in the hope that they may enhance the experience of others. Starting your own academic lab is a wonderful opportunity to impact science through research and trainee mentoring. In this article, we share some thoughts and resources for this undertaking in the hope that they may enhance the experience of others. The job of the principal investigator (PI) is one of possibility, joy, creativity, and opportunity. It is one of the few paid gigs that allows nearly limitless and self-directed variations on what success looks like and how it is achieved. At its best, it also allows individuals to freely pursue their ideas bounded only by their interest and ability. Yet, when we step into the role of a PI, we are no longer a team of one. Instead, our success is now dependent on our ability to form, lead, inspire, and manage a group of trainees. Because most of our own training to this point has focused on research, we can often find ourselves without the necessary leadership skills to navigate this process. In the past few years, both of us have started our own labs at quite different institutions. Our scientific paths have been unique, our personalities are different, and our research is distinct, and yet, we found ourselves facing the same challenging conundrums with a joint sense of gratitude for the opportunity and anxiety about getting it right. To help us navigate this process, we have relied on extensive discussions with seasoned PIs, other new PIs, mentors, leadership trainers, and HR experts. In this article, we provide perspectives from the trenches on what we have learned, including: (1) building an intentional culture; (2) strategic planning; (3) effective recruitment; and (4) growing skills for success. While every individual and situation is unique, we hope these real-time perspectives inform future and new PIs in designing and navigating their own academic adventures. Culture is the compilation of beliefs and behaviors that govern how a group of people interact and make decisions. Every organization has its own unique culture, and labs are no exception. If left to its own devices, the values and culture of a new group will arise organically, deriving from the people within it and the institutional environment. Once a culture has become established, it is often difficult to change as it can be passed from one generation of lab members to the next. If you are lucky, the organic values and culture that grow may match what you desire. Yet, this is often not the case. Indeed, many of us may have experienced challenging or even debilitating lab cultures in our own training. Fortunately, as the head of the lab you can directly shape the culture that your lab adopts. Start by defining what values are important to you. Do you most highly value hard work, creativity, collaboration, diversity, or collegiality? Consider choosing three words that communicate your core values as a person and a scientist. Next, clearly define what these values mean in a sentence or two. Writing these values down will make it easier to communicate them to your group and to reinforce them. Try to bring these values to life in your lab meetings, one-on-one meetings, collaborations, and your own behavior. And once you have defined your cultural values, you can help enable group members to exhibit them such that the decisions and behavior of the group begin to be derived from these values. You can also begin to recruit people to your lab who exhibit these traits. We have found that setting an intentional culture increases productivity, streamlines decision-making, enables better hiring decisions, and strengthens the scientific training environment and group cohesion. It also makes for a stellar and inspiring work environment for you and for your lab. Just like any small business, an academic lab can increase its impact, productivity, and thus fundability by developing and executing a strategic plan. This plan can be composed for different timescales, but a useful starting place can be a two-tiered approach composed of short-term (3 to 6 months) and long-term (1 to 3 years) goals. This plan acts as a map that defines for yourself and for your group where you are headed and how you will get there. There are many ways to structure strategic plans, but we suggest that they should contain at least four components: (1) the scientific mission statement of the lab; (2) what is most important right now; (3) how the short-term goals will be achieved; and (4) the longer-term vision or plans for scientific growth. Let’s tackle each of these areas in turn. The mission statement of the lab should be broad and impactful. Apple provides us with a good example. Their original mission statement was not to make computers. Rather it was, “to make a contribution to the world by making tools for the mind that advance humankind.” Thus, though their products would change over time, their mission would be consistent. By analogy, the mission of your group should be meaningful and stand the test of time as the science evolves. Next, decide what is most important right now (3 to 6 months) and make a list. Is it purchasing all the major equipment for your new lab? Getting an R01 funded? Hiring two new people? Submitting three papers that are near completion? Define your priorities and set a realistic timeline. Third, write down how you will achieve these goals. For example, will you leverage the whole group to push papers to completion? Or will you take the full day on Tuesdays and Thursdays to write that grant? Think about what resources, people, time, and organization structures will help get you where you want to go. Fourth, write down the longer-term goals of your group. Where do you want to be in 2 years? What publications/grants/technology/employees would you like to have and what might you need to do now to help make this possible? Now that you have a strategic plan, it’s time to implement it. Call a special meeting with your group and communicate your ideas and the reasoning behind your plan. Talk about what each lab member can do to make that plan a reality, and build in milestones to help hold yourself and your lab accountable. This can also be an excellent springboard toward helping trainees complete their individual development plans so that individual and group goals are aligned. You can take this process a step further by detailing a project management plan for each project or paper and structuring each goal. There are many software packages that aid in this process, including OmniPlan, Trello, and many others. In addition, Slack can be a good way for the lab to sync its discussion and for subgroups working on a given project to communicate. Finally, consider the strategic plan as a living document that should be evaluated and updated annually. In these evaluations ask whether the lab achieved its goals for the year. Celebrate successes and identify bottlenecks or impediments that may have caused shortfalls. We find that annual lab retreats or “state of the lab” meetings are a good time to evaluate progress, update plans for the future, and build group cohesion around these goals. Staffing a lab is one of the most important of all new PI tasks, and it’s also one of the most challenging. Since the people in the lab are the ones who primarily do the bench work, identifying and recruiting the right people are essential for a successful laboratory. However, accomplishing these tasks can be challenging even for seasoned group leaders. Below, we provide some perspectives for identifying, recruiting, and retaining good people as a new group leader. As new PIs, we are often relatively unknown. This means we need to go the extra mile to put ourselves out into the community so that we can recruit people into our labs. What can this extra mile look like? There are many options, but we have used the following strategies effectively. First, give local talks. It can be challenging to attract good candidates nationally at the beginning so often some of the best talent can be found close to home. These need not only be data talks. Several of our hires have approached us after we’ve given non-data talks on topics such as the academic job market. These types of interactions can point out the unique training environment that you offer and showcase your mentorship abilities. Second, go out of your way to interact with students. While postdoctoral fellows may want to go to well-established laboratories with track records of success, many students actively seek out new PIs with smaller labs who may have more time for one-on-one mentorship. Effective strategies for interacting with students can include teaching, serving on graduate student program committees, participating in recruitment events, going to social events and talks, or simply saying hello to new students in the hallway. In addition, get to know students at local and national meetings who could become future postdocs. Once you are fortunate enough to attract trainees to your lab, treat them well and foster their professional growth. Students and postdocs talk to each other, and one of the best recruitment strategies is being a good mentor who has a real interest in trainee success. Third, leverage your network. When recruiting, email your colleagues and friends, advertise at local universities and attend their job fairs, post on Twitter and LinkedIn, visit student posters at conferences and let them know about your group, ask your lab to be on the lookout, and get the word out about your position. Our experience has been that great hires can come from any of these approaches, and casting as wide a net as possible increases your chances of finding desirable candidates. Once you have identified candidates interested in your lab, the next challenge is determining what a “good” candidate looks like for your position. It helps to have a precise idea of what you are looking for and how you will evaluate a candidate for these features. Stick to your guns. Everyone is motivated to get people into their lab when starting out, but making bad personnel decisions at the beginning can have serious consequences. Be patient. In making hiring decisions think about what is most important for your science, your strategic plan, and your lab culture. This greatly simplifies the selection process and makes designing an appropriate interview easier. Are you looking for a specific skill set and will hire only in that space? Will you take all comers as long as they are trainable? If so, how will you determine who might be trainable? How will you assess the skills of these candidates when you interview them? And finally (and perhaps most importantly), how will you assess if they are also a good cultural fit for your group? Speaking directly with references regarding these issues can provide crucial insight. In addition, you may find that your hiring plan needs to be flexible. When we started our groups, we had master plans that included recruiting certain skills to the lab in a certain order. Within 6 months, we had to throw those plans out the window. These unicorn candidates did not exist; at least, not in our applicant pools. Instead, we redesigned the lab around the skill sets of the people whom we were fortunate enough to attract. This requires flexible thinking and planful management but has the advantage of optimizing for trainability, passion, commitment, and cultural fit. In this latter approach, then, it becomes vital to know what personal and culture features you are looking for and develop ways to assess them. Among other features, we look for and attempt to evaluate a candidate’s drive, resiliency, and humility. One approach is to combine an in-person skills assessment during an interview together with questions designed to understand why the person is engaged in science. This can take several forms. For example, if your work involves molecular biology and tissue handling, you could combine a written assessment of basic solution preparation and cloning principles together with mock tissue preps. This could be followed by questions designed to learn about a candidate’s personality and approach. The questions and assessment should vary depending on the position you are hiring for, but intentionally interviewing for scientific qualities as well as for the personal traits that will bring out the best in you and the lab will help increase the chance of a successful hire. Your next job is to get your best candidate to agree to join your young, but promising, lab. This can be a challenge because new PIs are competing for good talent with industry, established faculty, and a myriad of other career trajectories. Thus, you need to develop an effective closing strategy. The first piece of this puzzle is articulating what advantages your group offers. New PIs have several things working in their favor that they can offer: enthusiasm, flexibility, time, attention, and usually lots of good scientific ideas. The challenge is knowing how to effectively communicate this to incoming candidates. We have found it effective to follow up an interview with a phone call or email in which you clearly lay out all the advantages your group has to offer. Here is where your work on intentional culture comes into play. You can communicate your training culture to potential recruits so that they know they are signing on to an environment that is aware of and values them. You can also communicate how these values shape your mentoring style, science, and expectations of lab members. Finally, you can use this conversation as a platform to learn more about what the interviewee is looking for in an employer so you can make sure these needs align with your goals and approach. Achieving clarity about what you and your group offer and communicating your approach to mentoring will help candidates know they will have a firm foundation for the future. Science may be a calling, but for many the sound of this call can be distorted by elitism, unconscious bias, or simply a stringent “survival of the fittest” culture that can naturally advantage trainees with particular pedigrees or experiences. As lab heads, we have the power to change this. In fact, we believe that it is our responsibility to do so intentionally and actively. To address this, we have to become aware of the problem, not shy away from discussion, ask and listen, be open to new ideas, admit when we are wrong, and be willing to change. We also need to closely examine our own systems of evaluation in hiring and recruitment to determine if they are biased to exclude or devalue particular groups, identities, races, cultures, or genders. The traditional “meritocracy” at play in many hiring decisions can itself present problems. As so beautifully stated by Kenneth Gibbs in a recent article, “ … ‘scientific talent’ is not innate. It is cultivated through many hours of training and effort. Moreover, teams, not individuals, conduct most scientific research. … When we consider scientific research as group problem-solving, instead of the unveiling of individual brilliance, diversity becomes key to excellence” (Gibbs, 2014Gibbs, K.J. (2014). “Diversity in STEM: What It Is and Why It Matters.” Voices, Scientific American Blogs, https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/diversity-in-stem-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/. Accessed July 19, 2019.Google Scholar). Diversity and inclusion lead to better and more productive science by increasing the spectrum of ideas, perspectives, and approaches in our work and our solutions. While all of us hope and expect that all of our hires will be successful, sometimes this is not the case. An employee that is underperforming or exhibiting behaviors that are unacceptable can rapidly become detrimental to the group environment. Further, if not dealt with this can result in “sanctioned incompetence”: the appearance of multiple standards for performance among employees that can compromise motivation and productivity overall. First, be proactive in evaluating your employees and providing feedback, both positive and negative. If problems arise, say something—the sooner the better. Importantly, have these conversations in private and with compassion, but don’t wait for days or weeks to correct a behavior. Second, document your conversations and communications. Be clear about what needs to change and when and how this change will be evaluated. Finally, become familiar with documentation requirements, and if needed, offboarding rules and regulations at your institution. While employee transitions are never easy, being prepared helps smooth the process for all parties. In addition, an outcome that better matches the employee with a more appropriate job or employer will result in an improved future for the lab and the individual. As a new PI, it is often easy to feel somewhat powerless or overwhelmed in the face of the need to master a host of management and leadership skill sets we may lack. While we certainly learn from our mistakes (and we will make them), these errors can be costly to our productivity, lab environment, budget, and personal sense of well-being. Fortunately, there are ways to minimize the number of mistakes we will make by identifying our strengths and weaknesses as PIs. We can then put into place a plan to improve those areas in which we are weaker. We discuss some approaches to achieve this below. Each of us excels in certain areas and struggles in others. The good news is that we don’t have to be good at everything to succeed. In addition, the skills of leadership, management, politics, networking—all of the things we discuss in this article—can be learned. The first step is to perform an honest self-evaluation of your own PI skills and deficiencies. The next step is to apply the principles of science to becoming a more skilled PI. If there were a new protocol you needed to learn, you would first identify someone who was an expert in that approach. You would then ask them to collaborate so you could learn the approach, watch them, practice, and then try it yourself repeatedly until you had mastered it. Leadership skills are no different. For areas where you’d like to improve, look around for faculty who are knocking this area out of the park. Get to know them. Don’t be afraid to use the words, “Will you be my mentor?” For example, we each have different faculty we seek out for different sets of conundrums: the grant-writing gurus, the trainee whisperers, those who navigate sticky political situations with ease, etc. It also can be incredibly useful to have a set of peers at a similar career stage with whom you can bounce ideas off of. Local or virtual peer mentoring groups such as New PI Slack and Future PI Slack can provide such communities. Having someone to talk to when your grants or papers get rejected, or when you’ve had a difficult interaction, can make you feel less alone and can help you navigate these situations. Ask for what you need and seek help early and often. This allows mistakes to be less frequent and less costly. We also need to strive to admit when we’ve made mistakes and apologize—not only to colleagues, but also to our trainees. Being honest about where we are at in our learning trajectory can help everyone approach the young lab environment and the new PI with a sense of understanding and helpfulness. Now that you’ve identified mentors who can help you grow and develop PI skills, it is time to expand this network to help support your personal and professional growth. These individuals fall into two general categories: those that may be useful to your science, and those that may be useful to your management skills. Both are valuable. For building your science network, revisit your strategic plan. Are your immediate goals to get papers published? If so, meet with editors at meetings and get to know them. Discuss your findings to identify an appropriate journal. Get the community excited about your story by going to meetings. Science is about people, and if people know who you are and know your work, your name will come to mind when an opportunity arises. Travel and give talks. Look for occasions to speak in geographical areas you will be visiting. Don’t be afraid to ask for opportunities. Let your colleagues know that you would love to visit. Send emails to see if there are speaking slots locally or even nationally. Navigate this process with sensitivity and care, but often as new PIs we need to knock to find doors that may open. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that this type of networking can be uncomfortable or even downright scary for many of us introverts. Having a plan can be very helpful. Who at that next meeting would you like to talk to? Make a list, and then determine how you might arrange to meet these individuals. You can ask a colleague to introduce you or even set up formal or informal meetings on your own. Finally, decide what you’re going to say. You can write down these thoughts and practice out loud. This can take much of the mystery and uncertainty out of these initial encounters and can help foster your ability to make professional connections. In growing your managing skills, keep in mind that since almost no PIs have received formal training in leadership, business management, mentoring, etc., many of our mentors may not have the skills we seek. Fortunately, there is a wide world of management experts at your disposal. These individuals have made careers out of advising executives on a range of issues from strategic planning, to mentoring, to hiring, to networking, to brand management. Being open to these outside perspectives can help bring new and creative solutions to problems. It can also help set your lab apart as one that takes mentorship and leadership seriously. The other advantage is that since such advisors are outside academia, the new PI can feel at liberty to be completely honest about any issues without the potential of negatively impacting the perception of their colleagues. Finally, any advice they offer will be from a place of experience and expertise designed only with you and your lab in mind. Time is a finite resource, and the flat management structure of most labs means that the PI’s time quickly can become a bottleneck to productivity. In part this is because PIs can find themselves with many demands on their time: teaching, committees, institutional service, talks, meetings, writing, and travel—all of which can take time away from thinking about and managing the science and the lab. How can we navigate these many new demands? There are three common culprits to PI time drain. The first is saying “yes” when we should say “no.” When you are asked to do something, evaluate whether it advances your strategic plan. If not, strongly consider no. To make this process easier, consider prewriting a few types of “no” emails that you can modify when needed. This helps lessen the emotional burden of no. The second culprit is a lack of clearly defined goals. If priorities aren’t defined, it becomes much more difficult to determine how many hours per day should be devoted to which tasks. By tackling strategic planning, you will then be able to budget your time in line with these goals. The third culprit is distractions. This can come in the form of well-meaning distractions (lab members or faculty swinging by to chat), less well-intentioned distractions (lab drama or institutional politics), or technology (email and phones). Learn to protect your productivity from these time thieves. Turn off email at designated times of the day, develop a kind but clear note for your door, and have some prepared sentences to considerately end conversations with when you need to get to work. Like time, money is also a rate-limiting resource. Regardless of the startup package that you have negotiated, the money that you will receive to start your lab is finite. Since it is difficult to predict when additional grants may be funded, deciding when and how to spend your money can present a significant challenge. We suggest two strategies. The first may be obvious but it is nonetheless important: apply for grants early and often. Indeed, a number of grants that tend to have reduced requirements for preliminary data exist solely for new PIs. This “more shots on goal” approach (within reason) statistically increases the likelihood of funding. Second, plan your budget around your strategic scientific goals. What financial commitment is it going to take to achieve your short-term goals? Your long-term goals? How risk-averse or risk-tolerant are you? Do any goals need to be revised to better fund the lab? Identify options to maximize your lab dollars through collaboration, negotiating with companies when buying equipment, or helping to secure additional funding for your lab members through trainee grants. When hiring, consider the entire life cycle of the trainee salary and supply costs and the impact this will have on your budget. In addition, determine what significant non-salary costs your lab will incur (e.g., animal housing, sequencing, etc.) and design strategies to keep these costs in check. In these calculations it can be helpful to partner with financial analyst administrators at your institution. Finally, designate a quarterly time to review your lab’s finances and adjust your scientific, grant writing, and publishing goals based on these reviews. While money management is not the reason many of us entered science, it is vital to running a successful lab. The job of a PI is one of incredible possibility and stunning joy. However, the first few years of PI-hood can also be among the more stressful years of a scientific career. As you progress, remember to savor this well-earned opportunity. Take the time to do things in and out of the lab that give you energy and fulfillment so that the journey can be part of the fun. We hope that these tips will enable scientists to continue to find success, delight, and creativity in their roles as PIs that enable them to make discoveries and train mentees that change the world for the better.

I advocate here for investment in policymaker-scientist networks dedicated to such translation for a range of diseases.
https://openalex.org/W2975757717,"Respiratory variations in pulse pressure (dPP) and photoplethysmographic waveform amplitude (dPOP) are used for evaluation of volume status in mechanically ventilated patients. Amplification of intrathoracic pressure changes may enable their use also during spontaneous breathing. We investigated the association between the degree of hypovolemia and dPP and dPOP at different levels of two commonly applied clinical interventions; positive expiratory pressure (PEP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).20 healthy volunteers were exposed to progressive hypovolemia by lower body negative pressure (LBNP). PEP of 0 (baseline), 5 and 10 cmH2O was applied by an expiratory resistor and CPAP of 0 (baseline), 5 and 10 cmH2O by a facemask. dPP was obtained non-invasively with the volume clamp method and dPOP from a pulse oximeter. Central venous pressure was measured in 10 subjects. Associations between changes were examined using linear mixed-effects regression models.dPP increased with progressive LBNP at all levels of PEP and CPAP. The LBNP-induced increase in dPP was amplified by PEP 10 cmH20. dPOP increased with progressive LBNP during PEP 5 and PEP 10, and during all levels of CPAP. There was no additional effect of the level of PEP or CPAP on dPOP. Progressive hypovolemia and increasing levels of PEP were reflected by increasing respiratory variations in CVP.dPP and dPOP reflected progressive hypovolemia in spontaneously breathing healthy volunteers during PEP and CPAP. An increase in PEP from baseline to 10 cmH2O augmented the increase in dPP, but not in dPOP."
