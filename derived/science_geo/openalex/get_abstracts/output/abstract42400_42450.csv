https://openalex.org/W1977348907,"NF-kappa B is a nuclear protein, found only in cells that transcribe immunoglobulin light chain genes, that interacts with a defined site in the kappa immunoglobulin enhancer. This protein can be induced in pre-B cells by stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The induction involves a posttranslational activation, and the combined action of LPS and cycloheximide causes a superinduction. An active phorbol ester also induces this factor, and with kinetics more rapid than those for LPS stimulation. Phorbol-ester-mediated induction of NF-kappa B was observed in a T cell line (Jurkat) and a nonlymphoid cell line (HeLa), and is therefore not restricted to B-lymphoid cells. We interpret these results to indicate that factors that control transcription of specific genes in specific cells may be activated by posttranslational modification of precursor factors present more widely."
https://openalex.org/W1971057735,"The isolation of clones encoding the human surface protein T4, and the expression of the T4 gene in new cellular environments, have enabled us to examine the role of this protein in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Our studies support a mechanism of AIDS virus infection that initially involves the specific interaction of the AIDS virus with T4 molecules on the cell surface. This association can be demonstrated on T4+ transformed T and B lymphocytes as well as epithelial cells. Furthermore, the presence of T4 on the surface of all human cells examined is sufficient to render these cells susceptible to AIDS virus infection. Our data suggest that the T4-AIDS virus complex is then internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Finally, we find that the T4 gene is expressed in the brain as well as in lymphoid cells, providing an explanation for the dual neurotropic and lymphotropic character of the AIDS virus. In this manner, a T lymphocyte surface protein important in mediating effector cell-target cell interactions has been exploited by a human retrovirus to specifically target the AIDS virus to populations of T4+ cells."

https://openalex.org/W2005394493,"Formation of syncytia, with progression to cell death, is a characteristic feature of in vitro cultures of susceptible cells infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV)1–3. Viral antigen-positive multi-nucleated giant cells have also been observed in histological sections from infected individuals4,5. In vitro, formation of these multinucleated giant cells occurs through cell fusion which is dependent on cell-surface expression of the differentiation antigen CD4 (ref. 1). Utilizing a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the gene for the envelope glycoprotein of HTLV-III/LAV6, we demonstrate that cell-surface expression of this protein, in the absence of other HTLV-III/LAV structural or regulatory proteins, is sufficient to induce CD4-dependent cell fusion, leading to cell death, one of the characteristic manifestations of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) virus cytopathology. This process may contribute to the loss of CD4+ T cells seen in AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1986924748,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) binds to both high- and low-affinity classes of IL-2 receptors on activated T lymphocytes. Only the high-affinity receptors are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and normally transduce the mitogenic signals of IL-2; however, the structural features distinguishing the high- and low-affinity receptors are unknown. When 125I-labeled IL-2 was chemically cross-linked to activated human T lymphocytes, two major bands were identified. First, as predicted, a 68- to 72-kilodalton band, consisting of IL-2 (15.5 kilodaltons) cross-linked to the IL-2 receptor (55 kilodaltons), was observed. Second, an unpredicted 85- to 92-kilodalton moiety was detected. This band was not present when IL-2 was cross-linked to transfected C127 cells, which exclusively express low-affinity receptors. The data presented are most consistent with the existence of a 70- to 77-kilodalton glycoprotein subunit (p70) which, upon associating with the 55-kilodalton low-affinity receptor (p55), transforms it into a high-affinity site. It is proposed that p55 and p70 be referred to as the alpha and beta subunits, respectively, of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1660900149,"Human rheumatoid synovial cells in culture stimulated with the conditioned culture medium of rabbit macrophages secrete three distinct latent metalloproteinases. One of them, a proteinase that digests proteoglycan and other connective tissue matrix components, was purified as two active forms after activation with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. The two forms were homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis with Mr = 45,000 and Mr = 28,000, whereas the latent precursor was estimated to have Mr = 51,000 by gel permeation chromatography. Both active enzymes had optimal activity at pH 7.5-7.8 and were inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline but not by inhibitors for cysteine, serine, or aspartic proteinases. Removal of Ca2+ from the enzyme solution resulted in a complete loss of activity that could be fully restored by the addition of 1 mM Ca2+. The activity of the apoenzyme was restored by the addition of 0.5 mM Zn2+, 5 mM Co2+, or 5 mM Mn2+ in the presence of Ca2+ but not by each metal ion alone. The identical digestion patterns of reduced, carboxymethylated protein substrates indicated that both active forms of the enzyme have the same substrate specificity. The enzyme degraded cartilage proteoglycans, type I gelatin, type IV collagen, laminin, and fibronectin, and removed the NH2-terminal propeptides from chick type I procollagen. This enzyme may play a role in the normal turnover of the connective tissue matrix as well as in the joint destruction of chronic synovitis."

https://openalex.org/W2111224981,"Krüppel (Kr), a segmentation gene of Drosophila, encodes a protein sharing structural features of the DNA-binding ""finger motif"" of TFIIIA, a Xenopus transcription factor. Low-stringency hybridization of the Kr finger coding sequence revealed multiple copies of homologous DNA sequences in the genomes of Drosophila and other eukaryotes. Molecular analysis of one Kr-homologous DNA clone identified a developmentally regulated gene. Its product, a finger protein, relates to Kr by the invariant positioning of crucial amino acid residues within the finger repeats and by a stretch of seven amino acids connecting the finger loops, the ""H/C link."" This H/C link is conserved in several nuclear and chromosome-associated proteins of Drosophila and other eukaryotic organisms including mammals. Our results demonstrate a new subfamily of evolutionarily conserved nuclear and possibly DNA-binding proteins that again relate to a Drosophila segmentation gene as in the case of the homeo domain."
https://openalex.org/W2026488427,"Cells infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) show decreased expression of the 58-kilodalton T4 (CD4) antigen on their surface. In this study, the effect of HIV infection on the synthesis of T4 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein products was evaluated in T-cell lines. Metabolically labeled lysates from the T4+ cell line Sup-T1 were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to T4. Compared with uninfected cells, HIV-infected Sup-T1 cells showed decreased amounts of T4 that coprecipitated with both the 120-kilodalton viral envelope and the 150-kilodalton envelope precursor molecules. In four of five HIV-producing T-cell lines studied, the steady-state levels of T4 mRNA were also reduced. Thus, the decreased T4 antigen on HIV-infected cells is due to at least three factors: reduced steady-state levels of T4-specific mRNA, reduced amounts of immunoprecipitable T4 antigen, and the complexing of available T4 antigen with viral envelope gene products. The data suggested that the T4 protein produced after infection may be complexed with viral envelope gene products within infected cells. Retroviral envelope-receptor complexes may thus participate in a general mechanism by which receptors for retroviruses are down-modulated and alterations in cellular function develop after infection."
https://openalex.org/W1592919876,"Rat liver cytosol has low hydrolytic activity against [3H]methylcasein at neutrality, but activity increases greatly on addition of various compounds such as poly-L-lysine, N-ethylmaleimide, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting that it contains latent proteolytic activity. The latent enzyme was found to be stabilized in the presence of 20% glycerol and to be activated by addition of poly-L-lysine. The latent enzyme was purified from a crude extract of rat liver to apparent homogeneity in the presence of 20% glycerol by conventional chromatographic techniques. The purified enzyme showed endoproteolytic activity toward various proteins when it was activated by the compounds listed above. It preferentially degraded N-substituted tripeptide substrates with a basic amino acid at the carboxyl terminus, as well as peptides containing neutral hydrophobic amino acids. It did not require activation for these peptidase activities, in contrast to its activity toward large proteins. Interestingly, a proteinase and a trypsin-like and a chymotrypsin-like peptidase activity could not be separated by customary chromatographic methods but were distinguishable by their sensitivities to various inhibitors, activators, and covalent modifiers, suggesting that the enzyme has three distinct active sites within a single protein. The enzyme seems to be a seryl endopeptidase showing maximal activity at neutral and weakly alkaline pH values. Thus, the enzyme is a unique protease with latent multifunctional catalytic sites. The distribution of the protease in soluble extracts of various rat tissues and cells was examined quantitatively by an enzyme immunoassay. The enzyme level was highest in liver and also in spleen, stomach, lung, small intestine, and kidney, but was low in heart, diaphragm, skeletal muscle, brain, and skin. The concentrations of enzyme in some established cell lines including hepatoma and rat kidney cells were comparable to that in normal liver hepatocytes. The enzyme was found mainly in the cytosol fraction, although a small amount was associated with microsomal membranes, suggesting that it is an extralysosomal protease. Immunohistochemical staining of the liver and skeletal muscles showed that the protease is distributed diffusely in panlobular hepatocytes with slight centrilobar predominance and is present in Kupffer cells, vascular endothelial cells, and bile duct epithelial cells in the liver and also diffusely in the intermyofibrillar spaces and vascular endothelial cells in skeletal muscle. The quantitative data obtained in the present study indicate the presence of the protease in the cytosol fraction of all rat tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2016930286,"We have identified a factor in nuclear extracts that binds to the c-fos enhancer. Treatment of A431 cells with epidermal growth factor results in a rapid increase in the level of transcription and a concomitant increase in binding of the factor to the enhancer. Surprisingly, as transcription decreases rapidly, the enhancer-binding activity remains elevated. In addition, although HeLa cells exhibit no detectable transcription of the c-fos gene, they contain significant amounts of binding activity, comparable to those in induced A431 cells. These results suggest that regulation of c-fos transcription involves more than simply an increased level of a factor capable of binding the enhancer. Finally, transcription of c-fos in A431 cells is markedly induced by the tumor promoter TPA and the calcium ionophore A23187, yet neither induced an increased level of the enhancer-binding activity. These agents thus appear to activate c-fos transcription via a mechanism distinct from that used by epidermal growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2005576986,"The macronuclear DNA in the ciliated protozoan O. nova consists of ∼107 gene-sized DNA molecules, all of which terminate with 20 bp of C4A4 repeats followed by a 3′ (G4T4)2 single-stranded tail. Two immunologically distinct proteins of 55 and 26 kd, which are tenaciously, but noncovalently associated with Oxytricha macronuclear DNA termini, have been purified. These proteins protect DNA termini from degradation by the exonuclease Bal31. They also facilitate retention of natural and synthetic telomeric DNAs onto nitrocellulose. The Oxytricha proteins are not simply C4A4-binding proteins. Rather, their efficient binding requires both the 3′ single-stranded (G4T4)2 tail and the adjacent duplex region. Thus, these proteins require both the sequence and the structure of natural DNA termini for efficient binding. As such they represent the first described example of telomeric-specific proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2153942882,"Amplification of the N-myc gene is correlated with increased metastatic ability of human neuroblastomas. We show here that overexpression of the N-myc gene in a rat neuroblastoma cell line following gene transfer causes down-modulation of class I histocompatibility antigen expression and increases in the in vivo growth rate and metastatic ability of these cells. N-myc-mediated down-modulation of MHC class I antigen expression could be reversed by treatment with interferon without affecting the steady state level of N-myc mRNA. No effect on MHC class I antigen expression was found when the N-myc gene was expressed in rat fibroblasts, indicating that some of the effects caused by N-myc gene amplification are cell-type-specific."
https://openalex.org/W2061129160,"The 23.5 kd protein product of the ras-related YPT1 gene of S. cerevisiae was found to be essential for cell growth. The loss of YPT1 function, studied in cells with the YPT1 gene on chromosome VI regulated by the galactose-inducible GAL10 promoter, led to arrested cells that were multibudded and exhibited a complete disorganization of microtubules and an apparent loss of nuclear integrity. The YPT protein binds GTP specifically. GTP binding of the protein is essential for its intracellular function. The Asn121→lle substitution, generated by site-directed mutagenesis, had a dominant lethal phenotype, the expression of the mutant protein led to binucleated cells and abnormal spindles. In contrast to the S. cerevisiae RAS1 and RAS2 gene products, the YPT protein seems to be involved, directly or indirectly, in microtubule organization and function."

https://openalex.org/W1569367290,"We have isolated cDNA clones of the mRNA for rat UDP-glucuronosyltransferase that catalyzes the glucuronidation of 4-nitrophenol, by using synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization probes. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 1,927-base pairs cDNA insert has been determined. With untranslated sequences of 124 and 216 base pairs in the 5'- and 3'-terminal regions, respectively, the cDNA insert contained 1,587 base pairs that encode a complete primary structure of a putative precursor form of 4-nitrophenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase with a calculated molecular weight of 60,114. The cDNA sequence also indicates the presence of 25 amino acids preceding the sequence determined by microsequence of the isolated protein. This extrapeptide, for the most part, consists of hydrophobic amino acids which are characteristic of the signal peptides as found for secretory proteins and most transmembrane proteins. Furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative halt transfer signal of a hydrophobic segment (residues 487-510), which is flanked on both sides by the peptide segments of highly charged amino acid residues (residues 463-486 and 511-529). These features are consistent with the properties of transmembrane proteins. Specific cDNA probes were used to analyze the induction of the enzyme in rat tissues by treatment with 3-methylcholanthrene. RNA blot analysis showed that 3-methylcholanthrene increased 10- to 15-fold the amount of hybridizable mRNA in liver. The livers and kidneys from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats were found to contain almost the same amount of hybridizable mRNA, although the basal level in the kidney was much higher than that of the liver, and the amounts in the lung were much lower than that of the liver and kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2017419438,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and lymphocytes with NK-like activity contain a serine esterase activity which has been localized to their cytoplasmic granules by cytochemistry and subcellular fractionation studies. The serine esterase-specific inhibitor 3H-DFP labels two protein species in the granules. The two proteins, referred to as serine esterases 1 and 2 (SE 1 and SE 2), migrate with Mr of 34-36 kd and 28-30 kd, respectively, under reducing conditions. SE 1 shows trypsin-like activity and has been purified to apparent homogeneity. Under nonreducing conditions, SE 1 has an Mr of 60-66 kd, suggesting that it may consist of two disulfide-linked subunits of 34-36 kd each. SE 1 cleaves fibrin and casein, has a pl greater than 10, and optimal activity at pH 8. The substrate specificity of SE 2 is not known. The serine esterase activity is secreted by lymphocytes that have been stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187. The serine esterases described here could play an active role in cell-mediated killing."
https://openalex.org/W1601425978,"The geometries of two disulfide bridges genetically engineered into subtilisin have been characterized by x-ray crystallography to determine the structural and energetic constraints involved in introducing disulfide bonds into proteins. Both disulfide bridges (Cys-24-Cys-87 and Cys-22-Cys-87) exhibit atypical sets of dihedral angles compared to those for other reported disulfide structures in proteins. The geometric trends for naturally occurring disulfides in protein crystal structures are examined. Comparison of the disulfide-containing mutant protein structures with the wild-type structure shows that, in both cases, disulfide incorporation is accommodated by relatively minor changes in local main-chain conformation. The Cys-22-Cys-87 disulfide has two high energy dihedral angles (X2 = 121 degrees, X2' = 143 degrees). Both disulfides produce short non-bonded contacts with the main-chain."
https://openalex.org/W2009792051,"Mice immunized intradermally with extracts of Schistosoma mansoni in combination with the adjuvant BCG are significantly protected against subsequent infection with living larval forms of the parasite. Remarkably, these vaccinated animals produce antibodies predominantly against a single parasite protein of molecular weight 97 kilodaltons (Sm-97). A complementary DNA that encodes about half of the Sm-97 molecule has now been cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence reveals a protein containing periodic repeats of hydrophobic amino acids characteristic of an alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. The deduced amino acid composition of the cloned gene and several properties of the native protein are similar to that of paramyosin, an alpha-helical protein that forms the core for myosin filaments in invertebrate muscle. Paramyosin was isolated from Schistosoma mansoni adult worms and antibodies to Sm-97 were shown to react with this molecule as well as with a known paramyosin from molluscan muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1494597080,"Two terminal glycosyltransferases, a sialyltransferase and the blood group A alpha 1,3 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, were found to exhibit differential subcompartmentation in the Golgi apparatus of intestinal goblet and absorptive cells. As expected from their role in terminal glycosylation, the two glycosyltransferases and their products, sialic acid residues and blood group A substance, were localized in the trans cisternae of the Golgi apparatus of goblet cells. In contrast, however, they were found throughout the Golgi apparatus stack of adjacent absorptive cells, with the exception of the fenestrated first cis cisterna. The results are in contrast to the general view that enzymes in the glycosylation pathway are arranged in a cis to trans gradient across the Golgi apparatus and that such polarized distributions may instead be cell type-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1597529692,"Prostaglandin (PG) E2, known as a bone-resorption factor, was released as a predominant arachidonate metabolite in the culture medium of an osteoblastic cell line cloned from mouse calvaria (MC3T3-E1). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10 ng/ml) prominently enhanced endogenous PGE2 synthesis, requiring the simultaneous presence of unidentified factor(s) contained in bovine serum. PGE2 synthesis increased after a lag phase for 1-2 h and reached a maximum level at about 3 h after EGF addition. EGF-stimulated PGE2 synthesis was almost completely blocked by 10 microM cycloheximide or 1 microM actinomycin D. Furthermore, when the cells were pretreated with EGF, the microsomes exhibited an increased activity of fatty acid cyclooxygenase (arachidonic acid----PGH2), whereas the activity of PGE synthase (PGH2----PGE2) remained unchanged. These results suggested an EGF-mediated induction of cyclooxygenase. Following increased PGE2 synthesis, DNA synthesis increased and alkaline phosphatase activity decreased in a slower response to EGF. PGE2 (above 0.1 microM) added to the cells could replace EGF. However, such effects of EGF on the osteoblasts could not be attributed totally to an autocrine function of PGE2 produced by stimulation with EGF because these effects of EGF were not abolished by indomethacin, which blocked the PGE2 synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2091504157,"Lipopolysaccharide, a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, activates B lymphocytes and macrophages. Pertussis toxin, which inactivates several members of the G protein family of signaling components, including Gi and transducin, was found to inhibit the lipopolysaccharide-induced responses of the WEHI-231 B lymphoma cell line and the P388D1 macrophage cell line. These results, combined with the demonstration that lipopolysaccharide inhibits adenylate cyclase activity in P388D1 cells, strongly argues that lipopolysaccharide activation of cells is mediated by a Gi-like receptor-effector coupling protein."
https://openalex.org/W1493605791,"The mitochondrial DNA polymerase has been purified to near-homogeneity from early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the highly purified enzyme reveals two polypeptides with molecular masses of 125,000 and 35,000 daltons, in a ratio of 1:1. The enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 7.6 S and a Stokes radius of 51 A. Taken together, the data suggest that the D. melanogaster DNA polymerase gamma is a heterodimer. DNA polymerase activity gel analysis has allowed the assignment of the DNA polymerization function to the large subunit. The DNA polymerase exhibits a remarkable ability to utilize efficiently a variety of template-primers including gapped DNA, poly(rA).oligo(dT) and singly primed phi X174 DNA. Both the crude and the highly purified enzymes are stimulated by KCl, and inhibited by dideoxythymidine triphosphate and by N-ethylmaleimide. Thus, the catalytic properties of the near-homogeneous Drosophila enzyme are consistent with those of DNA polymerase gamma as partially purified from several vertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W2076285440,"Embryonic expression of transcripts from the Drosophila gene fushi tarazu (ftz) progresses through a series of spatial patterns, culminating in a seven-banded pattern at the cellular blastoderm stage. We studied the generation of this pattern using inhibitors of RNA synthesis (alpha-amanitin) and protein synthesis (cycloheximide). Injections of alpha-amanitin revealed that ftz RNA turns over extremely rapidly in the embryo, and we think that this may be essential to effect rapid changes in ftz RNA patterns. Injections of cycloheximide added to the normal domains of ftz expression, creating novel expression patterns that were dependent on the time of injection. These novel patterns suggest that two superimposed systems of repression establish the normal, seven-banded pattern of ftz expression. One system sets up a banded pattern over the entire length of the embryo, and the other restricts actual expression to the middle portion of the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1996010797,"The expression of the cellular src gene product pp60c-src was examined in an embryonal carcinoma cell line that differentiates in vitro into neuronlike cells after being treated with retinoic acid. Quantitative and qualitative changes in c-src expression accompanied the events associated with neuronal differentiation. The levels of pp60c-src increased 8- to 20-fold during the period when the cells elaborated neuritic processes and expressed neuron-specific proteins. The electrophoretic mobility of pp60c-src induced in these cells was retarded in comparison with that in untreated cells or in treated cells before neurite elaboration. The shift in electrophoretic mobility was due to an alteration in the amino terminal 16,000 daltons of pp60c-src and similar to an alteration of c-src protein found in neural tissues and in pure primary cultures of neuronal cells. These results indicate that expression of pp60c-src induced by retinoic acid in these embryonal carcinoma cells mimics the expression of c-src in developing neurons. Therefore, this embryonal carcinoma cell line provides a model system to investigate the function of the src protein in neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1534120898,"The predominant [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)-binding proteins that are released from the secretory granules of activated mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) are demonstrated to have an isoelectric point of approximately 9.1 and to be complexed to proteoglycans. Upon Sepharose CL-2B chromatography of the supernatants of calcium ionophore-activated BMMC, 67-78% of the total exocytosed [3H]DFP-binding proteins co-eluted in the excluded volume of the column as a greater than 1 X 10(7) Mr complex bound to 4-7% of the total exocytosed proteoglycans. The remainder of the exocytosed proteoglycans, which filtered in the included volume of the gel filtration column with a Kav of 0.66, contained chondroitin sulfate E glycosaminoglycans. After dissociation of the large Mr complexes of [3H]DFP-binding proteins-proteoglycans with 5 M NaCl and removal of the proteins via phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, the proteoglycans filtered from the Sepharose CL-2B column as a single peak with a Kav of 0.66. The susceptibility of 24-59% and 36-76% of the glycosaminoglycans in the large Mr complex to degradation by nitrous acid and chondroitinase ABC, respectively, indicated the presence of proteoglycans that contained heparin and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans. Disaccharide analysis revealed that the chondroitin sulfate in the high Mr complex was chondroitin sulfate E. Following chondroitinase ABC treatment of the large Mr complex, the residual heparin proteoglycans filtered on Sepharose CL-4B under dissociative conditions with the same Kav as the original, untreated proteoglycans. Thus, the protein-proteoglycan complexes that are exocytosed from activated mouse BMMC contain approximately equal amounts of proteoglycans of comparable size that bear either predominantly heparin or predominantly chondroitin sulfate E glycosaminoglycans. The demonstration of these secreted complexes indicates that the intragranular protease-resistant heparin and chondroitin sulfate E proteoglycans in the T cell factor-dependent BMMC bind serine proteases throughout the activation-secretion response."
https://openalex.org/W1607978009,"The self-aggregation behavior of casein kinase II from Drosophila melanogaster has been analyzed by velocity sedimentation and electron microscopy. The results indicate that self-aggregation involves the formation of linear polymers or filaments approximately 10 nm in diameter. In the presence of 1 mM EDTA filament length was inversely proportional to total ionic strength over a range from 0.05 to 0.28, and filaments as long as 0.5 micron were observed at the lower ionic strengths. Similar results were obtained in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2, but two additional ionic strength-dependent phenomena were superimposed. First, at subphysiological ionic strength side-to-side aggregation of filaments occurred which resulted in enzyme precipitation. Second, at physiological ionic strength a time- and temperature-dependent increase in filament length occurred which generated polymers up to 5 micron long. No side-to-side aggregation occurred under the latter conditions. Filamentous forms of the kinase could be readily reconverted to the standard alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer by the addition of high salt. Filamentous casein kinase II was observed over a pH range from 6.8 to 8.0, at enzyme concentrations ranging from 6 to 150 micrograms/ml, in the presence of ATP, and at MgCl2 concentrations from 1 to 10 mM. However, time-dependent growth of long filaments was not observed at Mg2+ concentrations below 10 mM. The conditions under which filaments are observed in vitro suggest that they may also exist in vivo. The possibility that filament formation plays a role in the regulation of casein kinase II activity is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2025143790,"Physiological levels of a purified T cell hormone, interleukin 2 (IL-2), were found to stimulate a cloned murine B cell line (BCL1) to secrete pentamer IgM antibody. The peptide hormone acts at the cell surface via specific IL-2 receptors and induces changes in the 5' chromatin of the J chain gene that correlate with its transcription and with the production of the J chain protein required for pentamer IgM assembly. There was no effect of IL-2 on cell proliferation nor on mu heavy chain gene transcription. These results define a specific function for IL-2 in B cell differentiation. In addition, the IL-2/BCL1 system provides a model for examining the mechanism by which signals generated by hormone-receptor interaction are transmitted to the nucleus and regulate gene expression."

Fibronectin is thought to participate in the attachment, and in this study the region of fibronectin that interacts with the surface receptors of T. cruzi trypomastigotes was investigated by testing the binding of the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, corresponding to the cell attachment site of fibronectin to T. cruzi trypomastigotes. Peptides with the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, but not Arg-Phe-Asp-Ser, Arg-Phe-Asp-Ser-Ala-Ala-Arg-Phe-Asp, Ser-Lys-Pro, Glu-Ser-Gly, or Ala-Lys-Thr-Lys-Pro, bound to the parasite surface and inhibited cell invasion by the pathogen. Monoclonal antibodies to the cell attachment domain of fibronectin also inhibited cell infection by the parasite. The immunization of BALB/c mice with tetanus toxoid-conjugated peptide induced a significant protection against T. cruzi. The data support the notion that the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser of cell surface fibronectin acts as a recognition site for attachment of the parasites."
https://openalex.org/W1966152350,"Expression of the dopa decarboxylase gene (Ddc) is regulated in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner throughout the life cycle of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Essential Ddc regulatory elements lie within 208 base pairs upstream from the RNA start point. Functional elements within this 5′ flanking region were mapped by deletion analysis, which assayed expression in vivo after germline integration via P element vectors. One of the elements is essential for expression in both the larval and adult central nervous system, and at least two other elements are necessary for quantitatively normal expression in the hypoderm. Within each of the intervals that have regulatory effects are found sequence elements conserved between the Ddc genes of two distantly related species of flies. On the basis of this correlation, regulatory functions for these sequence elements can be postulated."
https://openalex.org/W1512828307,"Three subspecies of RNA polymerase II, designated IIO, IIA, and IIB, have been described in a variety of eukaryotic cells and shown to differ in the molecular weight of their largest subunit, designated IIo, IIa, and IIb, respectively. The objectives of this study were to establish the in vivo molecular structure of RNA polymerase II in mammalian cells and to examine conditions that influence the stability of RNA polymerase II subspecies. Subunit affinity-purified antibodies were used to determine the relative concentration of subunits IIo, IIa, and IIb in crude extracts of calf thymus tissue, cultured bovine kidney cells, and HeLa cells. HeLa cells contain exclusively RNA polymerase IIO whereas both cultured bovine kidney cells and calf thymus tissue contain RNA polymerases IIO and IIA. RNA polymerase IIB was not detected at significant levels in any of the cell extracts examined. Cell extracts were aged at either 4 degrees or 37 degrees C and the stability of RNA polymerases IIO and IIA determined by protein blotting. In the presence of buffer normally used for RNA polymerase purification, subunit IIo disappears from calf thymus extracts within 24 h at 4 degrees C or within 5 min at 37 degrees C. RNA polymerase IIO is partially stabilized by the inclusion of protease inhibitors and further stabilized by the presence of relatively high concentration of EDTA and EGTA. The prior fractionation of nuclei does not have an appreciable effect on RNA polymerase II stability. An increase in the amount of reducing agent causes a dramatic reduction in the stability of subunit IIo. The following manuscript (Bartholomew, B., Dahmus, M. E., and Meares, C. F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 14226-14231) examines the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerases IIO and IIA in reactions dependent on the major late promoter of adenovirus-2. Photoaffinity labeling of subunits IIo and IIa, relative to their concentration in the transcription extract, indicates that the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase IIO is greater than 10 times that of IIA."
https://openalex.org/W1974557244,"T lymphocytes express on their surface not only a specific receptor for antigen and major histocompatibility complex proteins, but also a number of additional glycoproteins that are thought to play accessory roles in the processes of recognition and signal transduction. L3T4 is one such T-cell surface protein that is expressed on most mouse thymocytes and on mature mouse T cells that recognize class II (Ia) major histocompatibility complex proteins. Such cells are predominantly of the helper/inducer phenotype. In this study, complementary DNA clones encoding L3T4 were isolated and sequenced. The predicted protein sequence shows that L3T4 is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. It is encoded by a single gene that does not require rearrangement prior to expression. Although the protein has not previously been demonstrated on nonhematopoietic cells, two messenger RNA species specific for L3T4 are found in brain. The minor species comigrates with the L3T4 transcript in T cells, whereas the major species is 1 kilobase smaller."
https://openalex.org/W1601196993,"The effects of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) on epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor content and EGF action were studied in cultured granulosa cells from immature diethylstilbestrol-implanted rats. During follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-induced differentiation in vitro, EGF receptors increased by 20-fold as measured by the binding of 125I-EGF to the intact cells. Addition of TGF-beta during the 48-h culture period amplified the stimulatory effects of FSH on EGF receptors up to 2-fold, with ED50 and maximal concentrations of 2.5 and 8 pM, respectively. Also TGF-beta alone in amounts from 1.6 to 16 pM increased EGF receptor content 4-fold. The stimulatory effects of TGF-beta were due to increased numbers of EGF receptors/cell, since the growth factor had no effect on the Kd (3-5 X 10(-11) M) of the high-affinity EGF binding site. TGF-beta action was observed within 20 h of granulosa cell culture and was maximal by 48 h of a 96-h culture. The stimulatory actions of TGF-beta in gonadotropin-induced cells were exerted through the cAMP effector system of the granulosa cell, since the growth factor also amplified the induction of EGF receptors by cholera toxin, forskolin, and 8-bromo-cAMP. The augmentation of EGF receptors by TGF-beta resulted in a parallel 2-fold increase in the inhibitory effects of EGF on FSH-induced cAMP production and luteinizing hormone receptor expression during granulosa cell development. TGF-beta did not increase granulosa cell numbers during culture although it elevated [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by 2-fold over that of FSH-treated cells. These results indicate that TGF-beta regulates the effects of both FSH and EGF during granulosa cell differentiation and provides evidence that ovarian function may be controlled by the combined actions of gonadotropins and multiple growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1565338126,"We studied the ability of fragments of the light chain of human high molecular weight kininogen to bind to plasma prekallikrein. In a competitive fluorescence polarization assay, kallikrein-cleaved light chain (light chain-2; residues 49-255), a cyanogen bromide fragment (residues 185-242), and a tryptic peptide (T-7; residues 185-224) had binding affinities of approximately 20 nM, equivalent to the value for the intact light chain (residues 1-255) of high-molecular-weight kininogen. In contrast, fragments consisting of residues 49-184 and 243-255 showed no binding activity (Kd much greater than 1,000 nM). Direct titrations of fluorescein-labeled derivatives of light chain-2 and peptide T-7 with prekallikrein confirmed that T-7 retained full binding activity for prekallikrein (Kd = 12 +/- 2 nM for labeled light chain-2; Kd = 7 +/- 1 nM for labeled T-7). These results localize the binding site of high molecular weight kininogen for prekallikrein within a region of 40 amino acids (residues 185-224) that resides in the near carboxyl terminus of the light chain of kininogen."
https://openalex.org/W1539834676,"The flavin-containing NADH peroxidase of Streptococcus faecalis 10C1, which catalyzes the reaction: NADH + H+ + H2O2----NAD+ + 2H2O, has been purified to homogeneity in our laboratory for analyses of both its structure and redox behavior. Our findings indicate that the enzyme is a tetramer of four apparently identical subunits (Mr = 46,000/subunit), each containing one FAD coenzyme and a second non-flavin, nonmetal redox center. There is no evidence of nonequivalence among the flavins. Dithionite reduction of the enzyme occurs in two steps, with end points of 0.96 and 2.05 eq/FAD. The first step generates a two-electron reduced form of the enzyme (EH2) which is spectrally identical with that generated by aerobic addition of NADH. Our studies suggest that the long-wavelength absorbance band (lambda max approximately 540 nm) exhibited by this form results from charge-transfer interaction between the reduced non-flavin redox center and the oxidized flavin. A second type of long-wavelength charge-transfer absorbance band (lambda max approximately 770 nm) is generated on anaerobic addition of 1 eq of NADH to EH2 and results from interaction between oxidized FAD and the reduced pyridine nucleotide. Either the EH2 X NAD+ or the EH2 X NAD+ X NADH forms may be involved in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, as both are reactive with hydrogen peroxide."
https://openalex.org/W1637181533,"Affinity labeling with palmitic acid was used to identify long chain fatty acid-binding sites of bovine serum albumin. [1-14C]Palmitic acid was activated by esterification with N-ethyl-5-phenyl-isoxazolium-3'-sulfonate (Woodward's Reagent K). The product was purified by chromatography and shown to compete with unesterified fatty acids for binding sites on bovine serum albumin. Activated [14C]palmitic acid coupled covalently to albumin producing [14C]palmitoyl-albumins containing from 0.12 to a maximum of 6.9 mol of attached label per mol of albumin. The presence of the covalently attached affinity label depressed binding of other long chain fatty acids to albumin. Albumin carrying 1 eq. of [14C]palmitate was cleaved using cyanogen bromide, pepsin, and trypsin. Radioactive peptides were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Three peptides accounted for greater than 90% of the label. Residues labeled with [14C]palmitate were identified as Lys-116, Lys-349 and Lys-473, and the relative distribution of label was 10, 45, and 45% respectively, consistent with the presence of two strong binding sites in the COOH-terminal half of albumin and a somewhat weaker site in the NH2-terminal half."
https://openalex.org/W1599946116,"We have previously described a human tumor T cell line, IARC 301, which constitutively expresses biologically functional interleukin 2 (IL2) receptors. The fate of IL2 after binding to surface high affinity receptors was investigated. After a few minutes, IL2 is internalized at 37 degrees C and is subsequently degraded and released in the medium. The half-life for surface high affinity IL2 receptors, as measured in the presence of cycloheximide, is about 1 h and does not depend upon the presence of IL2. After trypsin digestion of cell surface high affinity receptors in the absence of protein biosynthesis, we could not detect any receptor reappearance on the cell membrane, whether IL2 was added or not. Taken together these results show that IL2 receptors are constantly internalized in these cells in the presence or absence of IL2 and that they do not recycle to the plasma membrane after receptor-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1496300950,"Modification of carboxyl groups on putidaredoxin with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide (EDC) resulted in loss of putidaredoxin reductase activity. The modification did not affect the visible absorption spectrum of putidaredoxin, indicating that the iron-sulfur center was not perturbed. In order to identify the carboxyl groups labeled by EDC, native and EDC-treated putidaredoxin were digested with a combination of trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus protease, and the resulting peptides were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. The most heavily modified carboxyl groups were found to be those at residues 58, 65, 67, 72, and 77. These carboxyl groups are located in the same general region of the protein as those on adrenodoxin that have been shown to be involved in binding to both adrenodoxin reductase and cytochrome P-450scc. Chemical modification was also used to compare the role of lysine, arginine, and histidine residues on putidaredoxin and adrenodoxin. Modification of lysine and arginine residues had no effect on the reductase activity of either protein. The reductase activity of adrenodoxin was unaffected by labeling with 1 eq of diethyl pyrocarbonate/histidine residue, but labeling with a second equivalent completely abolished both activity and the iron-sulfur center spectrum. In contrast, modification of the 2 histidines in putidaredoxin with 1 eq each resulted in nearly complete loss of reductase activity. There was no significant activity for adrenodoxin in the putidaredoxin reductase assay or for putidaredoxin in the adrenodoxin reductase assay, demonstrating that, in spite of the structural similarity between the two proteins, they are not interchangeable functionally."
https://openalex.org/W2065075363,"A stop transfer sequence derived from the extreme carboxyl terminus of membrane IgM heavy chain has been shown to confer predictable transmembrane orientation to secretory proteins by aborting translocation of subsequently synthesized protein domains. Here we demonstrate that, in certain peptide sequence contexts, the same stop transfer sequence is also capable of initiating domain translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Translocation directed by a stop transfer sequence is similar to, but distinguishable from, the action of a conventional signal sequence. Translocation is dependent on participation of the ribosome and protein receptors both in the cytoplasm and in the ER membrane. Moreover, both amino- and carboxy-terminal flanking protein domains can be translocated. Unlike a signal sequence, the stop transfer sequence is not itself translocated across the membrane. These results have implications for the nature of signal sequences, stop transfer sequences, and their receptor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1527089986,"Three tRNA5Asn genes have been subcloned from a tRNA gene cluster isolated from the cytogenetic locus 42A of Drosophila melanogaster. The three tRNAAsn genes, contained on plasmids pAsn6, pAsn7, and pAsn8, have identical mature tRNA coding regions but have different 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences. In vitro transcription in Drosophila Schneider S3 cell-free extracts showed the tRNAAsn genes had different transcription efficiencies. pAsn8 had a transcription efficiency of approximately 8 transcripts/gene/h, whereas pAsn6 was a less active template at 5 transcripts/gene/h. pAsn7 was the poorest template at 1.5 transcripts/gene/h. Exchanging 5'-flanking regions of the tRNAAsn genes showed that the differences in transcription efficiencies were attributable to the corresponding 5'-flanking region. Transcription of each of the tRNAAsn genes revealed a different optimum for KC1 concentration for each template which also was directly attributable to the corresponding 5'-flanking region. The salt is not related to the ability of the three tRNAAsn genes to sequester transcription factors as determined using the stable complex competition assay. Rather, this effect appears to be due to the ability of the respective 5'-flanking regions to interact with RNA polymerase III. The poorest transcription template, pAsn7, was a better competitor in the stable complex formation assay than either pAsn8 or pAsn6. We conclude that the pAsn7 stable complex binds and functionally arrests RNA polymerase III in the initiation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1552144311,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 4D (eIF-4D) was purified from human red blood cells by a simple 5-step procedure. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that most of the preparations of eIF-4D were composed of variable amounts of two closely migrating forms of the factor, each of which contained a single residue of the unique amino acid hypusine. The structural similarity of the two forms of human eIF-4D was evidenced by the indistinguishable patterns of radioactivity on peptide maps of tryptic digests prepared from radioiodinated samples. A peptide containing the single hypusine residue was readily isolated from a tryptic digest of human eIF-4D by virtue of its high positive charge and hydrophilic character. Amino acid sequence determination on this peptide revealed the following primary structure around hypusine: Thr-Gly-hypusine-His-Gly-His-Ala-Lys."
https://openalex.org/W1600041070,"Abstract 1-O-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines (platelet-activating factor (PAF] stimulate exocytosis in isolated lobules from guinea pig parotid glands or pancreas by an acetylcholine-like mechanism (Soling, H. D., Eibl, H. J., and Fest, W. (1984) Eur. J. Biochem. 144, 65-72). We show here that both tissues are able to synthetize PAF themselves. Isolated guinea pig parotid gland acini incorporate labeled acetate into the 2-position of PAF. Stimulation with A23187 or carbamoylcholine lead to a significant stimulation of this process. The newly synthetized PAF is partially released into the medium. Addition of lyso-PAF to the incubation medium does not significantly affect the rate of incorporation of labeled acetate into PAF in the absence or presence of carbamoylcholine. Isolated pancreatic lobules are also able to incorporate labeled acetate into PAF, and cholecystokinin and caerulein lead to a strong stimulation of this process. Incorporation of radioactive lyso-PAF into PAF, but not into 1-O-alkyl-2-long chain acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was also significantly stimulated by carbamoylcholine in isolated parotid acini. Under these conditions, the time-dependent stimulation of amylase release paralled that of lyso-PAF incorporation into PAF. The same holds for the concentration dependency of the carbachol effect on these two parameters. In isolated pancreatic lobules, caerulein also stimulated the incorporation of lyso-PAF into PAF. Pulse-chase experiments with radioactive lyso-PAF indicate that stimulation of incorporation of radioactive lyso-PAF into PAF represents increased net synthesis of PAF rather than increased PAF-turnover. Using the platelet aggregation test, substantial amounts (0.79 nmol/g) of PAF could be determined in isolated acini from guinea pig parotid glands."

https://openalex.org/W1600701683,"Low density lipoprotein (LDL) inhibits phagocytosis of certain negatively charged particulates and also inhibits subsequent cellular secretory and oxidative responses to these particulates. In the present work, we have defined the structural features of LDL involved in this activity. Starch-heptane extraction depleted greater than 95% of neutral lipids but had little effect on the capacity of LDL to inhibit monosodium urate crystal- or polystyrene latex bead-induced neutrophil chemiluminescence (CL). Liposomes containing gamma-palmitoyl-beta-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (PC) with unesterified cholesterol (PC:cholesterol = 2:1), PC and sphingomyelin (PC:sphingomyelin = 2.3:1), or PC alone lacked the capacity to inhibit urate-induced CL. However, incorporation of apoB-100 into liposomes via cholate dialysis rendered them nearly as inhibitory for urate-induced neutrophil CL as LDL on a protein weight basis. Moreover, delipidated apoB-100, containing less than 3% residual phospholipid, inhibited neutrophil responses to urate crystals or latex beads (degranulation and superoxide anion release) in a stimulus-specific manner. Modifications of the lysine residues of apoB (e.g. acetylation) reduced both the capacity of LDL to inhibit urate crystal-induced CL and to bind to urate crystals. The effects of apoB lysine residue modification were reversible, proportional to the extent of modification, and were not attributable to alteration of the net charge of apoB. Thus, the apoB-100 of LDL both mediates and shares the capacity of native LDL to inhibit certain neutrophil responses to particulates."
https://openalex.org/W1548326540,"1-O-[3H]Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([3H]PAF) and 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([3H]lyso-PAF) when incubated with rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were rapidly metabolized to 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([3H]alkyl-acyl-GPC) containing long chain acyl groups in the sn-2 position. The specificity and the absolute requirements of arachidonate (20:4) for acylation into PAF and lyso-PAF were investigated by comparing the rate of [3H]PAF and [3H]lyso-PAF metabolism by control rat PMN with that by rat PMN depleted of 20:4. Comparable rates of metabolism of [3H]PAF and [3H]lyso-PAF by both control and 20:4-depleted PMN were observed at all the concentrations of PAF and lyso-PAF studied. The nature of the fatty acyl group incorporated into the sn-2 position of the [3H]alkyl-acyl-GPC formed was analyzed by argentation chromatography. Dienoic fatty acids were the major fatty acid incorporated into the alkyl-acyl-GPC by both control and 20:4-depleted PMN at all the incubation times studied. At 3 min of incubation with [3H]PAF and [3H]lyso-PAF, control PMN had small but significant amounts of [3H]alkyl-acyl-GPC containing tetraenoic fatty acids, the concentration of which gradually increased as the incubation time progressed. On the other hand, under similar conditions, 20:4-depleted PMN had only trace amounts of the [3H]alkyl-acyl-GPC with tetraenoic fatty acid and the concentration of which remained at the low level throughout the incubation time. At 3 min of incubation, the 20:4-depleted PMN had small but significant amounts of [3H]alkyl-acyl-GPC with saturated fatty acids, the amount of which declined by 10 min and remained at that level as the incubation time progressed. While the concentration of [3H]alkyl-acyl-GPC with dienoic fatty acids in the 20:4-depleted cells gradually increased with the progress of incubation time, these molecular species of GPC in the control PMN remained more or less constant. In spite of a very high concentration (equivalent to that of 20:4 in control PMN) of eicosatrienoic acid (20:3 delta 5,8,11) in the 20:4-depleted PMN, no significant amounts of [3H]alkyl-acyl-GPC with trienoic fatty acid were formed by these cells. The rate of metabolism of [3H]PAF and [3H]lyso-PAF by the resident macrophages isolated from control and 20:4-depleted rats was similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1558113615,"Using a dual-label technique in which 3H- and 14C-labeled forms of putrescine and of spermidine were employed as biosynthetic precursors of hypusine, two -C-H bond cleavages were detected during production of this unique amino acid in Chinese hamster ovary cells. One of these cleavages occurs at C-1 of the 4-aminobutyl group during its transfer from the secondary amine nitrogen of spermidine to the nitrogen at the epsilon-position of a specific lysine residue in the polypeptide precursor of eukaryotic initiation factor 4D. Breakage of the other -C-H bond takes place at C-2 in this aminobutyl segment after it has been coupled to lysine to form the intermediate deoxyhypusine residue. Hydroxylation at this carbon atom, which constitutes the last step in hypusine biosynthesis, is the cause of bond cleavage. The data obtained are consistent with a notion that no additional -C-H bond fissions occur during hypusine biosynthesis. Our findings permit suggestion of a mechanism for enzymic aminobutyl group transfer in which 4-aminobutyraldehyde produced by oxidative cleavage of spermidine is coupled with the epsilon-amino group of a specific lysine residue to form an enzyme-bound imine intermediate."
