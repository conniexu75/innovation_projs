It has also been stated that it is most important that knowledge about the structure, diversity, and function of these ecosystems has priority in future biological research (2). Unfortunately, either these voices have not been heard or their arguments have not been convincing enough to promote action in this direction."

A large size favoring heat retention from muscular activity is probably responsible for this differential. Cooling rates (k) in water, measured on a second animal, were in the order of 0.001°C per minute per degree of difference between body and ambient temperature."

Among the data obtained were images and spectra of the terrestrial atmosphere and geocorona in the wavelength range below 1600 angstroms. These gave the spatial distributions and relative intensities of emissions due to atomic hydrogen, atomic oxygen, molecular nitrogen, and other species-some observed spectrographically for the first time."

The temperature of the psychrometer has been found to stay within 0.025 degrees C of the temperature of a simulated leaf when the latter temperature was changing at a rate of 1 degrees C per minute. Leaf water potentials can be measured with a precision of +/- 1 bar, or better."
https://openalex.org/W1981918524,Because the inflammatory process is complex its biochemistry is not yet well understood. Allergic reactions are actually harmful manifestations of the immune response causing inflammation in the affected part of the body. PGs (prostaglandins) have been implicated in the inflammatory and allergic reactions. Researchers however disagree on the precise nature of their involvement. Some researchers have demonstrated that PGs or certain ones can inhibit inflammation and hypersensitivity in both in vitro and in vivo models. Others have shown data which support the hypothesis that PGs are mediators of the inflammatory response. The problem is complicated by the fact that PGs vary in their effects depending on the species the cell or the organ system studied. Several researchers have hypothesized that PGs may influence inflammation through a feedback inhibition acting as an inflammatory agent at low concentrations and as an anti-inflammatory agent at higher concentrations.

https://openalex.org/W2024368445,"An assumption that equality problems are either absent or relatively trivial and easy is seen particularly in connection with issues related to the environment, national resources, knowledge and technology, and population growth. This chapter examines that assumption and systematically shows how a concern with rationality that ignores questions of ethics or justice is self-deluding if not self-serving. The entire basis of major national resource allocations is rarely probed in any depth. If national interest and prestige are to be useful in determining national goals, they must be defined by reference to other values whose independent validity is clear. In the case of military security, of course, there must be a national policy—it cannot be left up to the individual. Admittedly, many people submit in a docile fashion to paternalism in military affairs, although fewer are docile about less important but more personal matters such as pornography and marijuana."
