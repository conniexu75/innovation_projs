A persistent high frequency of these errors (chromosomal instability (CIN)) is predicted to profoundly impact tumor evolution and therapy response. It is unknown, however, how prevalent CIN is in human tumors. Using three-dimensional live-cell imaging of patient-derived tumor organoids (tumor PDOs), we show that CIN is widespread in colorectal carcinomas regardless of background genetic alterations, including microsatellite instability. Cell-fate tracking showed that, although mitotic errors are frequently followed by cell death, some tumor PDOs are largely insensitive to mitotic errors. Single-cell karyotype sequencing confirmed heterogeneity of copy number alterations in tumor PDOs and showed that monoclonal lines evolved novel karyotypes over time in vitro. We conclude that ongoing CIN is common in colorectal cancer organoids, and propose that CIN levels and the tolerance for mitotic errors shape aneuploidy landscapes and karyotype heterogeneity."

However, little is known regarding cardiovascular health in Indonesia. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of elevated CVD risk in a specific region of Indonesia. Methods We conducted full household screening for cardiovascular risk factors among adults aged 40 years and older in 8 villages in Malang District, East Java Province, Indonesia, in 2016–2017. 10-year cardiovascular risk scores were calculated based on the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension’s region-specific charts that use age, sex, blood pressure, diabetes status and smoking behaviour. Results Among 22,093 participants, 6,455 (29.2%) had high cardiovascular risk, defined as the presence of coronary heart disease, stroke or other atherosclerotic disease; estimated 10-year CVD risk of ≥ 30%; or estimated 10-year CVD risk between 10% to 29% combined with a systolic blood pressure of > 140 mmHg. The prevalence of high CVD risk was greater in urban (31.6%, CI 30.7–32.5%) than in semi-urban (28.7%, CI 27.3–30.1%) and rural areas (26.2%, CI 25.2–27.2%). Only 11% and 1% of all the respondents with high CVD risk were on blood pressure lowering and statins treatment, respectively. Conclusions High cardiovascular risk is common among Indonesian adults aged ≥40 years, and rates of preventive treatment are low. Population-based and clinical approaches to preventing CVD should be a priority in both urban and rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2943312188,"Iron–sulfur clusters are essential cofactors of proteins. In eukaryotes, iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis requires a mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster machinery (ISC) and a cytoplasmic iron–sulfur protein assembly machinery (CIA). Here we used mitochondria and cytoplasm isolated from yeast cells, and [35S]cysteine to detect cytoplasmic Fe–35S cluster assembly on a purified apoprotein substrate. We showed that mitochondria generate an intermediate, called (Fe–S)int, needed for cytoplasmic iron–sulfur cluster assembly. The mitochondrial biosynthesis of (Fe–S)int required ISC components such as Nfs1 cysteine desulfurase, Isu1/2 scaffold, and Ssq1 chaperone. Mitochondria then exported (Fe–S)int via the Atm1 transporter in the inner membrane, and we detected (Fe–S)int in active form. When (Fe–S)int was added to cytoplasm, CIA utilized it for iron–sulfur cluster assembly without any further help from the mitochondria. We found that both iron and sulfur for cytoplasmic iron–sulfur cluster assembly originate from the mitochondria, revealing a surprising and novel mitochondrial role. Mitochondrial (Fe–S)int export was most efficient in the presence of cytoplasm containing an apoprotein substrate, suggesting that mitochondria respond to the cytoplasmic demand for iron–sulfur cluster synthesis. Of note, the (Fe–S)int is distinct from the sulfur intermediate called Sint, which is also made and exported by mitochondria but is instead used for cytoplasmic tRNA thiolation. In summary, our findings establish a direct and vital role of mitochondria in cytoplasmic iron–sulfur cluster assembly in yeast cells. Iron–sulfur clusters are essential cofactors of proteins.

Iron–sulfur clusters are vital cofactors of proteins that perform critical functions inside mitochondria (e.g. electron transfer by respiratory complexes or aconitase activity in the TCA cycle) and outside of mitochondria (e.g. ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, DNA repair, DNA transcription, iron regulation, and tRNA modifications) (1Melber A.

However, such a mitochondria–cytoplasm interaction has thus far not been mechanistically understood.

The situation in the cytoplasm is different. The CIA machinery is apparently incomplete, requiring a contribution from mitochondria to function as an assembly apparatus for cytoplasmic iron–sulfur clusters. This idea was originally hinted at by in vivo experiments in which mitochondrial Nfs1 cysteine desulfurase was depleted from yeast cells using a regulated promoter. These experiments resulted in deficient sulfur use in both mitochondria and cytoplasm (35Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R.

Here we show that mitochondria export an essential intermediate, called (Fe–S)int, to the cytoplasm that is then used for cytoplasmic iron–sulfur cluster assembly. However, the situation is even more complex, because another intermediate, a sulfur-only intermediate called Sint, is made and exported by mitochondria and is required for cytoplasmic tRNA thiolation (39Pandey A.

However, these intermediates are distinct; they are not biochemically equivalent, and they are not interchangeable. A key feature that emerges from this study is that iron for (Fe–S)int originates in mitochondria. The TCA cycle enzyme aconitase [4Fe-4S] resides in the mitochondrial matrix. We found that mitochondria isolated from wild-type (WT) yeast cells contain a pool of apoaconitase (apo-Aco1) that can serve as a substrate for [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly (19Pain J. Balamurali M.M.

For example, when isolated WT mitochondria were incubated with [35S]cysteine, nucleotides (GTP, NADH, and ATP), and iron, the endogenous apo-Aco1 became radiolabeled because of insertion of newly formed Fe–35S clusters (Fig. 1A, lane 1, mitochondrial pellet P). In contrast, no radiolabeled signal was detected when isolated WT cytoplasm was incubated with [35S]cysteine under identical conditions (Fig. 1A, lane 2, cytoplasmic supernatant S). WT mitochondria were then added to WT cytoplasm and incubated with [35S]cysteine in a similar manner. The reaction mixture was centrifuged, separating mitochondria from cytoplasm. As expected, radiolabeled aconitase was found in the mitochondrial pellet (Fig. 1A, lane 3). A strong radiolabeled band was now detected in the cytoplasm, and this was due to 35S-thiolation of endogenous tRNAs (39Pandey A. Pain J. Dziuba N. Pandey A.K. Dancis A. Lindahl P.A. Pain D.

TNBCs have an altered metabolism, including an increased Warburg effect and glutamine dependence, making the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 therapeutically promising for this tumor type. Accordingly, CB-839 is currently in phase I/II clinical trials. However, not all TNBCs respond to CB-839 treatment, and the tumor resistance mechanism is not yet fully understood. Here we classified cell lines as CB-839–sensitive or –resistant according to their growth responses to CB-839. Compared with sensitive cells, resistant cells were less glutaminolytic and, upon CB-839 treatment, exhibited a smaller decrease in ATP content and less mitochondrial fragmentation, an indicator of poor mitochondrial health. Transcriptional analyses revealed that the expression levels of genes linked to lipid metabolism were altered between sensitive and resistant cells and between breast cancer tissues (available from The Cancer Genome Atlas project) with low versus high glutaminase (GLS) gene expression. Of note, CB-839–resistant TNBC cells had increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) protein and CPT1 activity levels. In agreement, CB-839–resistant TNBC cells mobilized more fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidation, which responded to AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase signaling. Moreover, chemical inhibition of both glutaminase and CPT1 decreased cell proliferation and migration of CB-839–resistant cells compared with single inhibition of each enzyme. We propose that dual targeting of glutaminase and CPT1 activities may have therapeutic relevance for managing CB-839–resistant tumors.

https://openalex.org/W2943123860,"The black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens (L., 1758) (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), is an endemic fly species from the tropical, subtropical and warm temperate zones of America. This saprophagous species relies on its environment where it finds the decomposing matter for the larvae to grow. The polyphagous diet and the macronutrient quality (mainly lipids and proteins) of these larvae make them excellent candidates for various applications such as waste and organic material management, incorporation in animal feed or alternative energy source. Although rearing development in temperate regions requires artificial processes to continuously produce high quality eggs and larvae, few studies have been conducted on the mating and oviposition processes governing H. illucens reproduction. Research conducted in semi-artificial rearing conditions showed that the number of mating varied according to the season. It has been speculated that this behavior could be due to differences in the intensity of sunlight caused by the change of seasons. This study aims at evaluating the influence of sex-ratio, density and nycthemeral cycle on H. illucens reproduction. In order to tackle this issue, an artificial set up for oviposition to collect eggs has been developed. This egg collection system aims at centralize oviposition and simplify eggs collection. Two populations with opposite sex-ratio (male-dominant and female-dominant) were selected. Their respective eggs productions have been evaluated for five breeding densities. Eggs weights varied significantly among the densities for each opposite sex-ratio population and female dominant population produced most eggs weight from 6500 individuals /m3. Finally, four nycthemeral cycles (2, 6, 12 and 18h of daily light) were simulated to evaluate the impact of light duration on reproduction. Early oviposition pic associated with a decrease of the oviposition period are shown when H. illucens are exposed to increasing light duration. These experiments enable improvement of the understanding on artificial reproduction of H. illucens."

Cellular interactions and transitions are mechanisms that facilitate membrane remodeling to maintain its integrity. Dysregulation of cellular remodeling, primarily mediated by oxidative stress (OS), is often associated with preterm birth. However, the mechanisms that maintain membrane homeostasis remain unclear. To understand these mechanisms, we developed an amnion membrane organ-on-chip (AM-OOC) and tested the interactive and transition properties of primary human AECs and AMCs under normal and OS conditions. AM-OOC contained 2 chambers connected by type IV collagen-coated microchannels, allowing independent culture conditions that permitted cellular migration and interactions. Cells grown either independently or coculture were exposed to OS inducing cigarette smoke extract, antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), or both. When grown independently, AECs transitioned to AMCs and migrated, whereas AMCs migrated without transition. OS caused AECs' transition but prevented migration, whereas AMCs' migration was unhindered. Coculture of cells facilitated transition, migration, and eventual integration in the contiguous population. OS cotreatment in both chambers facilitated AECs' transition, prevented migration, and increased inflammation, a process that was prevented by NAC. AM-OOC recapitulated cellular mechanisms observed in utero and enabled experimental manipulation of cells to determine their roles during pregnancy and parturition.-Richardson, L., Jeong, S., Kim, S., Han, A., Menon, R.

To define components critical for lysosomal homeostasis that are affected by this disease, here we quantified the lysosomal proteome in cerebellar cell lines derived from a CLN3 knock-in mouse model of human Batten disease and control cells. We purified lysosomes from SILAC-labeled, and magnetite-loaded cerebellar cells by magnetic separation and analyzed them by MS. This analysis identified 70 proteins assigned to the lysosomal compartment and 3 lysosomal cargo receptors, of which most exhibited a significant differential abundance between control and CLN3-defective cells. Among these, 28 soluble lysosomal proteins catalyzing the degradation of various macromolecules had reduced levels in CLN3-defective cells. We confirmed these results by immunoblotting and selected protease and glycosidase activities. The reduction of 11 lipid-degrading lysosomal enzymes correlated with reduced capacity for lipid droplet degradation and several alterations in the distribution and composition of membrane lipids. In particular, levels of lactosylceramides and glycosphingolipids were decreased in CLN3-defective cells, which were also impaired in the recycling pathway of the exocytic transferrin receptor.

To gain insight into mechanisms underlying neuronal degeneration, and to define components critical for lysosomal homeostasis in CLN3 disease, we performed a SILAC-based comparative mass spectrometric analysis of isolated lysosomes from cerebellar cell lines of WT and Cln3 knock-in mice (Cln3Δex7/8) exhibiting the 1-kb deletion in the Cln3 gene (12Fossale E.

We found that the protein concentration of 28 soluble lysosomal enzymes was significantly reduced in Cln3Δex7/8 lysosomes associated with various changes in the lipid composition of Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells. These were biochemically evaluated and found to contribute to differentially affected transport routes of endocytic cargo receptors. We performed SILAC-based comparative proteomics and quantified the relative amounts of lysosomal proteins at steady state in lysosomal fractions isolated from WT and Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells (PXD004548; lysosomal proteome analysis) exhibiting storage material (Fig. S1) by means of internalized dextran-stabilized magnetite transported to LysoTracker-positive organelles (Fig. S2). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that 197 and 170 of the identified proteins were annotated to vacuole and lysosome annotation in the database, containing 502 and 411 mouse proteins, respectively. We found in the isolated lysosomal fractions 104 of 185 experimentally confirmed lysosomal proteins comprising 47 soluble and 23 core membrane proteins (Table S1), and 34 associated proteins on the cytoplasmic lysosomal membrane. The majority exhibited a statistically significant differential abundance. In addition, the concentrations of three cargo receptors, 300-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor (Mpr300), LDL receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1), and Lrp2 (also known as megalin), involved in trafficking of M6P-containing and nonphosphorylated lysosomal enzymes (16Hiesberger T.

Furthermore, numerous peripheral membrane proteins on the cytoplasmic side of lysosomes involved in vesicular targeting, positioning, and signaling have been covered by our proteomic analysis. Six lysosomal enzymes were increased 1.5- to 2.3-fold in lysosomal fractions of Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells compared with WT controls (Fig. 1A): dipeptidylpeptidase 2 (Dpp7), tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 (Tpp1), RNase T2 (Rnaset2), lysosomal α-glucosidase (Gaa), α-galactosidase A (Gla), and palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (Ppt1). In contrast, the amounts of 28 proteins were clearly decreased. Among these are enzymes involved in the degradation of glycans (arylsulfatase B (Arsb), β-gal (Glb1), β-hexosaminidase subunit α (Hexa) and β (Hexb), GalNAc-6-sulfatase (Galns), β-mannosidase (Manba), β-glucuronidase (Gusb), and α-l-fucosidase (Fuca1)), or lipids (Glb1, N-acylethanolamine–hydrolyzing acid amidase (Naaa), Hexa, Hexb, prosaposin (Psap), putative phospholipase B-like 2 (Pldb2), galactosylcerebrosidase (Galc), arylsulfatase A (Arsa), acid ceramidase (Asah1), group XV phospholipase A2 (Pla2g15), and lysosomal acid lipase (Lipa)). These proteins, as well as the following were decreased by 16 to 80% in Cln3Δex7/8 lysosomal fractions compared with WT: neuronal ceroid-lipofuscin protein 5 (Cln5), Niemann Pick type C2 protein (Npc2), cathepsin D (Ctsd), DNase-2-α (Dnase2), cathepsin Z (Ctsz), lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase (Prpc), Creg1, legumain (Lgmn), carboxypeptidase Q (Cpq), sialate O-acetylesterase (Siae), and mammalian ependymin-related protein 1 (Epdr1). To verify the proteomic data, the expression levels of nine soluble lysosomal proteins were determined by Western blotting and enzymatic activity in whole cell lysates (Fig. 1, B and C). The amounts of immunoreactive Ctsd, Ctsz, and Creg1 were strongly reduced or almost absent in Cln3Δex7/8 cells (Fig. 1B). In agreement with the comparative proteomic data, the activities of Ppt1 and Gla, representing the most enriched proteins in lysosomal fractions of Cln3Δex7/8 cells, were significantly increased, whereas the activities of Hexb, Arsa, Manba, and Gusb were reduced in Cln3Δex7/8 cells (Fig. 1C). Next, we examined whether changes in the amounts of lysosomal membrane proteins in Cln3Δex7/8 cells affect other lysosomal functions. Although three subunits of the vATPase (Atp6d1, Atp6g1, and Atp6v1h) and the accessory protein 1 (Atp6ap1) were significantly changed in their abundance in lysosomal fractions of Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells (Fig. 2A and Table S1), ratiometric pH measurements showed unchanged lysosomal H+ concentrations in mutant cells (pH 4.53 ± 0.08 (WT) versus 4.49 ± 0.09 (Cln3Δex7/8); Fig. 2B). Therefore, our data do not support a role of CLN3 in lysosomal pH maintenance of neuronal cells, although previous studies reported on changes in vacuolar pH in yeast cells lacking the CLN3 homologue btn1 (8Gachet Y. Codlin S. Hyams J.S. Mole S.E. btn1, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of the human Batten disease gene CLN3, regulates vacuole homeostasis.J.

Clonal effects responsible for the observed phenotype in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells are unlikely because we found similar reductions in Ctsd and Ctsz protease or Lrp1 level in primary embryonic fibroblasts isolated from Cln3Δex7/8 mice (Fig. S3) The proteomic analysis of lysosomal fractions revealed a 2.2-fold increased concentration of Mpr300 in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells compared with WT controls (Fig. 3A) which was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the relative number of Mpr300 was also determined by ligand-binding experiments on saponin-treated cerebellar cells (representing the total number of Mpr300) or on untreated cells (representing Mpr300 localized at the cell surface) using recombinant human 125I-labeled arylsulfatase B (125I-ARSB) as lysosomal indicator ligand. Binding studies with 125I-ARSB at 4 °C revealed about doubled Mpr300 sites at the surface of Cln3Δex7/8 cells compared with WT cells, which corresponded to the 2.2-fold higher expression in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells determined in the presence of saponin (Fig. 3C). To examine the functional significance of increased amounts of Mpr300 in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells, we performed Mpr300-dependent internalization assays using 125I-ARSB as Mpr300 ligand. Because there is a continuous and constitutive exchange between Mpr300 localized at the cell surface and Mpr300 in all intracellular membranes with the same kinetics (21Braulke T. Gartung C. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Is movement of mannose 6-phosphate-specific receptor triggered by binding of lysosomal enzymes?.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104 (2953746): 1735-174210.1083/jcb.104.6.1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the uptake is proportional to the total number of Mpr300. Cerebellar cells were incubated with 125I-ARSB for 20 to 100 min. The specificity of Mpr300-mediated uptake of 125I-ARSB was demonstrated by the complete inhibition by M6P (Fig. 3D, lanes 6 and 12). In both WT and Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells, the amounts of 125I-ARSB precursors increased with incubation time. Quantification of both cell-associated radioactivity and measurement of radioactivity in excised 125I-ARSB bands from the gel demonstrated 2-fold higher amounts of 125I-ARSB in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells compared with WT controls (Fig. 3E). Because the amounts of 11 soluble lysosomal proteins involved in lipid degradation are significantly reduced in lysosomes of Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells, we analyzed the lipidome of WT and Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells by electrospray ionization MS (ESI-MS). To increase the sensitivity of MS detection, cerebellar cells of three independent preparations were combined, and anionic and neutral lipids were analyzed separately (Tables S2 and S3). The eight anionic lipid species which showed the most pronounced change in their relative amount included several GM3 and GD1 ganglioside species with a sphingosine (d18:1) backbone and variable acyl chains. The levels of GM3 species were increased 1.4- to 2.8-fold in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells compared with the WT cells, whereas GD1 species were reduced by 50%. Particular phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS) species (38:3) had 1.6-fold elevated values in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells (Table S2). In addition, numerous alterations in the relative amounts of neutral lipid species were detected in Cln3Δex7/8 cells. Lactosylceramides (LacCer) 24:0 and 16:0 showed the strongest increase (5.0- and 4.7-fold, respectively) in Cln3Δex7/8 cells. The elevated levels of LacCer were confirmed by BODIPY® FL C5-Lactosylceramide (Bodipy-LacCer) fluorescence live cell microscopy. Following binding at 4 °C and a switch to 33 °C, in WT cells, the majority of Bodipy-LacCer co-localized with Golgi-RFP used to stain the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, in Cln3Δex7/8 cells, the total Bodipy fluorescence was higher than in WT cells and mostly co-localized in LysoTracker-positive organelles (Fig. 4, C and D). Other lipid species that showed increased levels (1.5- to 2.1-fold) for these cells included lysophosphatidyl-ethanolamine (LPE) 20:3, sphingomyelin (SM) 24:1, ceramides (Cer) 24:0 and 24:1, and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) 38:3 and 40:3. At the same time SM14:0 and 15:0, PE40:4, phosphatidylcholine (PC) 38:4, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 20:4, and hexose cerebrosides (HexCer) 18:0, 20:0, 22:0, and 23:0 were reduced to 30–60% of the WT levels (Table S3). GC with mass selective detection (GC-MS) revealed losses of essential arachidonic acid, 20:4n-6 (in PE40:4, PC38:4) compensated by increases of its precursor 20:3n-6 and nonessential 20:3n-9 (in LPE20:3, PE38:3, PE40:3) (Table S4). In addition, immunofluorescence intensity of perilipin-2 (Plin2), an envelope protein of lipid droplets (22Sztalryd C. Brasaemle D.L. The perilipin family of lipid droplet proteins: Gatekeepers of intracellular lipolysis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Biol. Lipids. 2017; 1862 (28754637): 1221-123210.1016/j.bbalip.2017.07.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), was increased in Cln3Δex7/8 compared with WT cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, loading of the cells with oleate revealed a stronger expansion in cytosolic Plin2-associated lipid droplets in Cln3Δex7/8 cells, suggesting impaired degradative capabilities. Taken together, the comparative lipidome analyses of cerebellar cells revealed distinct alterations, in particular in the relative contents of glycosphingolipids in Cln3Δex7/8 cells, which can be partially explained by changes in the steady-state expression levels of lysosomal sphingolipid-degrading hydrolases. To determine whether re-expression of CLN3 could reverse alterations in lysosomal homeostasis, we infected WT and Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells with lentiviruses expressing human CLN3 N-terminally tagged with GFP (GFP-CLN3) or GFP alone under a CMV promotor driving high transgene expression. After antibiotics selection for GFP- and GFP-CLN3–positive cells (Fig. S4), in both cell lines GFP-CLN3 was found primarily localized in the ER and to some extent in lysosomes (Fig. S5). However, re-expression of GFP-CLN3 neither affected the reduced cathepsin D and Z levels and decreased activities of lysosomal glycosidases, nor the oleate-induced formation/accumulation of Plin2-positive lipid droplets in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells (Fig. S6). Because the intracellular distribution and transport of membrane proteins between different subcellular compartments, in particular along the endocytic and autophagic pathways, depend on the lipid composition of the membranes (23Kobayashi T.

The TrfR protein level was not changed in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells (Fig. S7). However, the amount of Trf-Alexa Fluor® 546 detected intracellularly after 30-min incubation was significantly increased in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells compared with WT cells (Fig. 6, A and D). The continuously internalized Trf-Alexa Fluor® 546 is detectable beneath the plasma membrane, in small vesicles evenly distributed over the whole cell, and in larger, more dilated structures in perinuclear regions partially co-localizing with Rab11a and the Golgi marker protein Gm130 characteristic for the transferrin-recycling pathway (Fig. S8) (26Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. Rab11 regulates recycling through the pericentriolar recycling endosome.J.

The identity of organelles mainly retaining Trf in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells needs to be studied. To examine whether the increased accumulation of Trf-Alexa Fluor® 546 in Cln3Δex7/8 cells is because of elevated uptake or reduced recycling and exocytosis, the cells were incubated for 30 min with Trf-Alexa Fluor® 546, washed, and further incubated for 15 min in the presence of Trf-Alexa Fluor® 488 (Fig. 6B). As expected, the Alexa Fluor® 546 fluorescence completely disappeared in WT cells because of the release of Apo-Trf into the medium accompanied by the accumulation of Trf-Alexa Fluor® 488 (Fig. 6, B and D, upper row). In contrast, in Cln3Δex7/8 cells both Trf-coupled fluorophores partially co-localized in the same intracellular membrane structures (Fig. 6, B and D, lower row). During a further 15-min chase in medium lacking Trf-Alexa Fluor® ligands, almost no ligand-related fluorescence was observed in WT cells (Fig. 6, C and D, upper row), whereas both Trf-Alexa Fluor® 546 and Trf-Alexa Fluor® 488 were still detectable in Cln3Δex7/8 cells (Fig. 6, C and D, lower row). These data demonstrate that the exocytic pathway of Trf from the recycling endosome to the plasma membrane is strongly disturbed in Cln3Δex7/8 cells. The homeostasis of lysosomes relies on the balance between the biosynthetic replenishment of lysosomal components, degradation, and recycling of macromolecules obtained by endocytosis and autophagy. Our analysis of the lysosomal proteome of Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells provides novel insight into complex regulatory mechanisms linking altered composition of lysosomes and dysregulated membrane transport. We found that the amounts of only few enzymes are increased, whereas the majority is decreased in Cln3Δex7/8 lysosomes (Fig. 1A and Table S1). Therefore, we predicted impaired capabilities for degradation of multiple classes of substrates in Cln3Δex7/8 lysosomes, which was supported by transmission EM revealing heterogeneous storage material in enlarged lysosomes composed by dense and multilamellar bodies, electron-lucent floccular bodies and curvilinear and fingerprint-like material in Cln3Δex7/8 cerebellar cells characteristic for accumulation of proteins, glycans, and glycolipids (Fig. S1). Recently, Sabatini and colleagues (28Wyant G.A. Abu-Remaileh M. Frenkel E.M. Laqtom N.N. Dharamdasani V. Lewis C.A. Chan S.H. Heinze I. Ori A. Sabatini D.M.

Although both LysoIP and our magnetite-loading protocol differ in recovery of lysosomes, cell types (lysosomal membrane protein–overexpressing HEK 293T cells versus SILAC-labeled mouse-derived cerebellar cells), the total number of identified proteins in the lysosomal fractions, the composition of soluble and integral lysosomal membrane proteins, and peripheral proteins on the cytoplasmic side of lysosomes are relatively similar. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of MS leads to the identification of a considerable number of nonlysosomal “contaminating” proteins. Because the role of lysosomes as purely degradative organelles changed in the past years toward central players in autophagy/mitophagy/ribophagy, energy metabolism, nucleus signaling, physical contacts with other organelles, or adaptive intracellular positioning (28Wyant G.A.

https://openalex.org/W2943772525,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes act as transporters for different molecules across biological membranes and are involved in a diverse range of biological processes. In this study, we performed a genome-wide identification and expression analysis of genes encoding ABC transporter proteins in three Capsicum species, i.e., Capsicum annuum, Capsicum baccatum and Capsicum chinense. Capsicum is a valuable horticultural crop worldwide as an important constituent of many foods while containing several medicinal compounds including capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin. Our results identified the presence of a total of 200, 185 and 187 ABC transporter genes in C. annuum, C. baccatum and C. chinense genomes, respectively. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content were determined in green pepper fruits (16 dpa). Additionally, we conducted different bioinformatics analyses including ABC genes classification, gene chromosomal location, Cis elements, conserved motifs identification and gene ontology classification, as well as profile expression of selected genes. Based on phylogenetic analysis and domain organization, the Capsicum ABC gene family was grouped into eight subfamilies. Among them, members within the ABCG, ABCB and ABCC subfamilies were the most abundant, while ABCD and ABCE subfamilies were less abundant throughout all species. ABC members within the same subfamily showed similar motif composition. Furthermore, common cis-elements involved in the transcriptional regulation were also identified in the promoter regions of all Capsicum ABC genes. Gene expression data from RNAseq and reverse transcription-semi-quantitative PCR analysis revealed development-specific stage expression profiles in placenta tissues. It suggests that ABC transporters, specifically the ABCC and ABCG subfamilies, may be playing important roles in the transport of secondary metabolites such as capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin to the placenta vacuoles, effecting on their content in pepper fruits. Our results provide a more comprehensive understanding of ABC transporter gene family in different Capsicum species while allowing the identification of important candidate genes related to capsaicin content for subsequent functional validation."
https://openalex.org/W2943228997,"Haloferax volcanii is a well-established model species for haloarchaea. Small scale RNomics and bioinformatics predictions were used to identify small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), and deletion mutants revealed that sRNAs have important regulatory functions. A recent dRNA-Seq study was used to characterize the primary transcriptome. Unexpectedly, it was revealed that, under optimal conditions, H. volcanii contains more non-coding sRNAs than protein-encoding mRNAs. However, the dRNA-Seq approach did not contain any length information. Therefore, a mixed RNA-Seq approach was used to determine transcript length and to identify additional transcripts, which are not present under optimal conditions. In total, 50 million paired end reads of 150 nt length were obtained. 1861 protein-coding RNAs (cdRNAs) were detected, which encoded 3092 proteins. This nearly doubled the coverage of cdRNAs, compared to the previous dRNA-Seq study. About 2/3 of the cdRNAs were monocistronic, and 1/3 covered more than one gene. In addition, 1635 non-coding sRNAs were identified. The highest fraction of non-coding RNAs were cis antisense RNAs (asRNAs). Analysis of the length distribution revealed that sRNAs have a median length of about 150 nt. Based on the RNA-Seq and dRNA-Seq results, genes were chosen to exemplify characteristics of the H. volcanii transcriptome by Northern blot analyses, e.g. 1) the transcript patterns of gene clusters can be straightforward, but also very complex, 2) many transcripts differ in expression level under the four analyzed conditions, 3) some genes are transcribed into RNA isoforms of different length, which can be differentially regulated, 4) transcripts with very long 5’-UTRs and with very long 3’-UTRs exist, and 5) about 30% of all cdRNAs have overlapping 3’-ends, which indicates, together with the asRNAs, that H. volcanii makes ample use of sense-antisense interactions. Taken together, this RNA-Seq study, together with a previous dRNA-Seq study, enabled an unprecedented view on the H. volcanii transcriptome."
https://openalex.org/W2942859174,"Heartland virus (HRTV) is a pathogenic phlebovirus recently identified in the United States and related to severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) emerging in Asia. We previously reported that SFTSV disrupts host antiviral responses directed by interferons (IFNs) and their downstream regulators, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. However, whether HRTV infection antagonizes the IFN-STAT signaling axis remains unclear. Here, we show that, similar to SFTSV, HRTV also inhibits IFN-α- and IFN-λ-mediated antiviral responses. As expected, the nonstructural protein (NSs) of HRTV (HNSs) robustly antagonized both type I and III IFN signaling. Protein interaction analyses revealed that a common component downstream of type I and III IFN signaling, STAT2, is the target of HNSs. Of note, the DNA-binding and linker domains of STAT2 were required for an efficient HNSs-STAT2 interaction. Unlike the NSs of SFTSV (SNSs), which blocks both STAT2 and STAT1 nuclear accumulation, HNSs specifically blocked IFN-triggered nuclear translocation only of STAT2. However, upon HRTV infection, IFN-induced nuclear translocation of both STAT2 and STAT1 was suppressed, suggesting that STAT1 is an additional HRTV target for IFN antagonism. Consistently, despite HNSs inhibiting phosphorylation only of STAT2 and not STAT1, HRTV infection diminished both STAT2 and STAT1 phosphorylation. These results suggest that HRTV antagonizes IFN antiviral signaling by dampening both STAT2 and STAT1 activities. We propose that HNSs-specific targeting of STAT2 likely plays an important role but is not all of the tactics of HRTV in its immune evasion."
https://openalex.org/W2943796681,"Heat stress-induced sperm DNA damage has recently been demonstrated in boars during tropical summer; which could negatively impact early embryo survival and litter size in sows. Given the boar’s inefficient capacity to sweat, non-pendulous scrotum and low antioxidant activity in seminal plasma, elevated endogenous levels of antioxidants are needed to combat reactive oxygen species induced during periods of heat stress. This should prevent the build-up of pathological levels of DNA damage in boar spermatozoa. Our aim was to investigate whether a combined antioxidant supplement could mitigate sperm DNA damage in boars exposed to tropical summer conditions. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling and flow cytometry of 20,000 spermatozoa/boar/treatment revealed that boar diets supplemented with 100 g/day custom-mixed antioxidant during peak wet summer effectively reduced sperm DNA damage by as much as 55% after 42 and 84 days treatment respectively (16.1 ± 4.9 peak wet control vs. 9.9 ± 4.5 42 day vs. 7.2 ± 1.6% 84 day treatments; P ≤ 0.05). Supplementation did not improve sperm concentration beyond control levels for either season (P > 0.05); nor alter total motility, progressive motility or several other motion parameters measured by computer assisted sperm analysis of 20 x 106 sperm/mL at 38°C (P > 0.05). Antioxidant supplementation during tropical summer appears to mitigate the negative impact of heat stress on DNA integrity but not concentration nor motility of boar spermatozoa; which may provide one solution to the problem of summer infertility in the pig."
https://openalex.org/W2943527776,"Among cereal crops, salinity tolerance is rare and complex. Multiple genes control numerous pathways, which constitute plant's response to salinity. Cell cultures act as model system and are useful to investigate the salinity response which can possibly mimic a plant's response to stress. In the present study two indica rice varieties, KS-282 and Super Basmati which exhibited contrasting sodium chloride (NaCl) stress response were used to establish cell cultures. The cell cultures showed a contrasting response to salt stress at 100 mM NaCl. High level of intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) were observed in sensitive cell culture for prolonged period as compared to the tolerant cells in which an extracellular H2O2 burst along with controlled intracellular H2O2 and NO signal was seen. To evaluate the role of NO in inducing cell death under salt stress, cell death percentage (CDP) was measured after 2-4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) pre-treatment. CDP was reduced significantly in both tolerant and sensitive cell cultures emphasizing NO's possible role in programmed cell death. Expression analysis of apoplastic NADPH oxidase, i.e. OsRbohA and recently characterised OSCA family members i.e. OsOSCA 1.2 and OsOSCA 3.1 was done. Intracellular H2O2/NO levels displayed an interplay between Ca2+ influx and ROS/RNS signal. Detoxifying enzyme (i.e. ascorbate peroxidase and catalase) activity was considerably higher in tolerant KS-282 while the activity of superoxide dismutase was significantly prominent in the sensitive cells triggering greater oxidative damage owing to the prolonged presence of intracellular H2O2. Salt stress and ROS responsive TFs i.e. OsSERF1 and OsDREB2A were expressed exclusively in the tolerant cells. Similarly, the expression of genes involved in maintaining high [K+]/[Na+] ratio was considerably higher and earlier in the tolerant variety. Overall, we suggest that a control over ROS production, and an increase in the expression of genes important for potassium homeostasis play a dynamic role in salinity tolerance in rice cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2942680836,"The hypoxia of high-altitude (HA) residence increases the risk of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preeclampsia 3-fold, augmenting perinatal morbidity and mortality and the risk for childhood and adult disease. Currently, no effective therapies exist to prevent these vascular disorders of pregnancy. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) is an important regulator of uteroplacental vascular development and function and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IUGR and preeclampsia. Here, we used a model of HA pregnancy in mice to determine whether hypoxia-induced fetal growth restriction reduces placental PPAR-γ protein expression and placental vascularization and, if so, to evaluate the effectiveness of the selective PPAR-γ agonist pioglitazone (PIO) for preventing hypoxia-induced IUGR. Hypoxia resulted in asymmetric IUGR, placental insufficiency, and reduced placental PPAR-γ expression; PIO prevented approximately half of the fetal growth restriction and attenuated placental insufficiency. PIO did not affect fetal growth under normoxia. Although PIO was beneficial for fetal growth, PIO treatment reduced placental vascular density of the labrynthine zone in normoxic and hypoxic (Hx) conditions, and mean vascular area was reduced in the Hx group. Our results suggest that pharmacological PPAR-γ activation is a potential strategy for preventing IUGR in pregnancies complicated by hypoxia, although further studies are needed to identify its likely metabolic or vascular mechanisms.-Lane, S.

The methodology was developed using the ES matrix approach, which can be applied to evaluate and map ES at different geospatial units such as land use/land cover classes. A Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) was constructed in order to include additional spatial information on environmental characteristics in the assessment. The integration of additional data, which describes site-specific characteristics such as soil type and slope, resulted in shifted probability distributions for the nutrient regulation ES potential. The focal objective of the study was of methodological nature: to test the application of a BBN as an integrative modelling approach combining the information from the ES matrix with additional data sets. In the process, both study areas were assessed with a regional differentiation with regard to the predominant landscape types. For both study areas, regional differences could be detected. Furthermore, the results indicate a spatial mismatch between ES demand and supply of the nutrient regulation potential. Land management and agricultural practices seem not to be in harmony with the spatial patterns of the environmental characteristics in the study areas. The assessment on the local scale, which comprised higher resolution input data, emphasized these circumstances even more clearly."
https://openalex.org/W2943761045,"A healthy gastrointestinal (GI) tract with a properly established microbiota is necessary for a foal to develop into a healthy weanling. A foal’s health can be critically impacted by aberrations in the microbiome such as with diarrhea which can cause great morbidity and mortality in foals. In this study, we hypothesized that gut establishment in the foal transitioning from a diet of milk to a diet of grain, forage, and pasture would be detectable through analyses of the fecal microbiotas. Fecal samples from 37 sets of foals and mares were collected at multiple time points ranging from birth to weaning. Bacterial DNA was isolated from the samples, and the V4 domain of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified via polymerase chain reaction. Next generation sequencing was then performed on the resulting amplicons, and analyses were performed to characterize the microbiome as well as the relative abundance of microbiota present. We found that bacterial population compositions followed a pattern throughout the early life of the foal in an age-dependent manner. As foals transitioned from milk consumption to a forage and grain diet, there were recognizable changes in fecal microbial compositions from initial populations predominant in the ability to metabolize milk to populations capable of utilizing fibrous plant material. We were also able to recognize differences in microbial populations amongst diarrheic foals as well as microbial population differences associated with differences in management styles between facilities. Future efforts will gauge the effects of lesser abundant bacterial populations that could also be essential to GI health, as well as to determine how associations between microbial population profiles and animal management practices can be used to inform strategies for improving upon the health and growth of horses overall."
https://openalex.org/W2943530694,"Whether growing cancer cells prefer lactate as a fuel over glucose or vice versa is an important but controversial issue. Labeling of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates with glucose or lactate isotope tracers is often used to report the relative contributions of these two metabolites to the TCA cycle. However, this approach may not yield accurate results, as isotopic labeling may not accurately reflect net contributions of each metabolite. This may be due to isotopic exchange occurring during the conversion between pyruvate and lactate. To evaluate this quantitatively, we used an equation (CG − CG′ = CL′ − CL) assessing the relationship between isotopic labeling and net consumption measurements in vitro. CG and CL refer to the contributions of glucose and lactate to the TCA cycle as measured by their net consumption, whereas CG′ and CL′ refer to glucose's and lactate's contributions determined with isotopic labeling. We found that the isotopic labeling data overestimate the net contribution of lactate to the TCA cycle and underestimate that of glucose. The overestimated amount is equal to the isotopic exchange amount between pyruvate and lactate. After excluding the interference of isotopic exchange, the major carbon contribution (i.e. acetyl-CoA) to the TCA cycle comes from glucose rather than lactate in vitro. We propose that these relative contributions of glucose and lactate may also be present in cancer cells in vivo."

We hypothesized that by simultaneously applying directed evolution to both domains of a full-length TIMP on the yeast surface, we might probe the roles of each individual domain as well as any cooperative dynamic in MMP recognition; by evolving the intact multidomain protein holistically, we could optimize functional domain interplay. Here, by creating a YSD library incorporating diversity into both domains of TIMP-1 and analyzing mutations of variants selected for improved binding to an already extremely high-affinity natural target, the MMP-3 catalytic domain (MMP-3cd), we aimed to evaluate the potential contributions of each TIMP domain to MMP affinity. The results of our analyses identify an unsuspected role for the TIMP-1 C-terminal domain in evolving MMP-3 affinity, mediated through synergistic effects between distant sites on the opposing TIMP domains. Protein structures of TIMP-1 mutants cocrystallized with MMP-3cd provide insights into the domain cooperativity of TIMP-1 variants with improved MMP-3cd binding. Our results have important implications for development of therapeutic TIMPs with optimized MMP-binding characteristics, while our conceptual approach may be more widely applicable to the application of directed evolution as a tool to probe domain interplay in other multidomain proteins. To explore the roles of each TIMP-1 domain in modulating MMP binding and inhibition, we first developed a platform for YSD of full-length human TIMP-1. The free, exposed N terminus of TIMP-1 is required for MMP binding and inhibition (6Gomis-Rüth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P.

Display of TIMP-1 bearing the correctly processed, mature N terminus was optimized by deletion of Glu-Ala residues from the signal sequence, which otherwise were inefficiently removed by yeast STE13 protease (Fig. 1). The optimized construct was N-terminally processed by yeast protease Kex2, resulting in efficient display of a functional TIMP-1 fusion that demonstrated robust MMP binding, as detected using biotinylated MMP-3cd (Figs. 1C and 2, A and D). MMP-3cd was selected as a model for the TIMP-1/MMP interaction as it offers a well-studied, well-behaved minimal MMP catalytic domain, and its interaction with TIMP-1 has been structurally characterized (6Gomis-Rüth F.X.

We also evaluated the potential benefit of codon optimization of the human TIMP-1 gene for yeast but found minimal impact on efficiency of display (Fig. 1D).Figure 2Screening a library of TIMP-1 mutants for MMP-3 binding. A, schematic diagram illustrates how a library of TIMP-1 mutants (blue/green) was displayed on the yeast surface. TIMP-1 expression was measured using fluorescent conjugated c-myc antibody (red star), and MMP-3 binding was measured using biotinylated MMP-3cd (orange) and fluorescent conjugated streptavidin (purple star). TIMP-1 variants with improved MMP-3cd binding were screened using FACS. B, library diversity was focused in 17 residues of TIMP-1 (loops in red), located in both the N-terminal (blue) and C-terminal (green) domains, that interact with bound MMP-3cd (orange) in PDB structure 1UEA. Targeted residues are located in the AB-loop, C-connector, and EF-loop of the N-terminal domain, and the GH-loop and MTL of the C-terminal domain.

The TIMP-1 mutant library was constructed aiming to achieve on average three to four mutations per variant through incorporation of degenerate codons and yielded a library size of ∼5 × 106 independent TIMP-1 variants in yeast upon transformation. The YSD TIMP-1 library was screened using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) by incrementally decreasing the concentration of biotinylated MMP-3cd in successive rounds of sorting, selecting for clones with enhanced affinity toward MMP-3cd (Fig. 2, A and D). After several rounds of FACS to enrich the pool for variants with highest MMP-3 binding relative to TIMP-1 expression, the enriched pool showed significant enhancement in MMP-3 binding compared with both the naïve library and WT TIMP-1 (Fig. 2D). The further enriched TIMP-1 variants isolated after six rounds of FACS screening, representing a total of four unique sequences, showed up to 10-fold binding improvement compared with WT TIMP-1 (Fig. 3, A–C). The high-affinity MMP-3-binding TIMP-1 variants obtained from library screening contained four to five mutations per gene; notably, all sequences contained mutations in both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Fig. 3C). To identify the mutations directly responsible for affinity improvements, we next generated single-mutant constructs representing the most prevalent mutations and assessed MMP-3cd binding on the yeast surface. Mutations L34G located in the AB-loop and T98D located in the EF-loop of the TIMP-1 N-terminal domain each conferred significant improvement (Fig. 4A), and yet the binding enhancements of these single mutants were modest by comparison with the composite mutants selected from the library (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the L34G mutation co-occurred repeatedly in combination with Gly-154 mutations in the multiple-turn loop (MTL) of the C-terminal domain located ∼30 Å away. To evaluate the potential functional interaction of these distant residues, we next generated and evaluated several TIMP-1 double-mutant constructs. We found that although TIMP-1 single mutations affecting Gly-154 in isolation had no significant impact on MMP-3 binding (Fig. 4A), several substitutions at this position (Ala, His, and Lys) had a powerful synergistic effect when combined with the L34G mutation (Fig. 4, B–D). In each case examined, the L34G/G154X double mutants showed binding improvements indistinguishable from those of the corresponding library clones, suggesting that mutations at these two sites were sufficient to confer the full functional improvements of selected clones C1, C9, and C14. By contrast, TIMP-1 double mutants combining G154A/H with T98D did not demonstrate similar augmentation of MMP-3 binding affinity above that of the T98D single mutant (Fig. 4, E and F), suggesting that Gly-154 mutations modify MMP affinity in a context-dependent fashion rather than conferring an independent and additive effect. To extend our findings and quantitatively evaluate protease-inhibitory activity of TIMP-1 variants in solution, we next cloned, expressed, and purified soluble forms of several of the mutant TIMP-1 proteins using a human cell expression system. We then assessed inhibition of MMP-3cd activity by soluble WT TIMP-1 and TIMP-1 variants L34G, L34G/G154A, and C1 using an enzyme inhibition assay that measured the reduced rate of cleavage of a fluorometric substrate in the presence of increasing concentrations of the inhibitor. Data were fitted to Morrison’s tight binding equation (Equation 1) to determine equilibrium inhibition constants (Ki) (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Importantly, these solution studies corroborated the YSD findings; variant C1 showed >5-fold improvement compared with WT TIMP-1, an effect fully recapitulated by theTIMP-1-L34G/G154A variant (Table 1). Thus, we find consistent evidence from both solution studies and YSD demonstrating that TIMP-1 C-terminal domain mutations can act cooperatively with N-terminal domain mutations to modulate MMP binding and inhibition.Table 1Ki values for TIMP-1 variantsTIMP-1 mutantKipmWT93.4 ± 8.1L34G33.5 ± 4.2L34G/G154A16.7 ± 1.5C117.8 ± 1.8 Open table in a new tab To gain structural insights into the effect of amino acid substitutions on the binding mechanism of TIMP-1 with MMP-3cd, we cocrystallized the TIMP-1-L34G and TIMP-1-C1 (L34G/L151C/L133P/G154A) mutants in complex with MMP-3cd and solved the crystal structures of the complexes.

The two Tyr rings, one from each protein, stretch across the interface to form H-bonds with the partner protein, TIMP-1 Tyr-35 with the MMP-3 Phe-154 backbone carbonyl and MMP-3 Tyr-155 with the TIMP-1 Gly-34 backbone carbonyl. Additionally, the two Tyr aromatic rings form hydrophobic and edge-to-face π interactions bridging the interface. Formation of this reciprocal tyrosine clasp is facilitated by substantial backbone displacements in the TIMP-1-L34G AB-loop and the MMP-3 S-loop compared with the WT TIMP-1/MMP-3cd complex (Fig. 6C). In the WT TIMP-1 structure, bulkier Leu-34 pushes these two loops apart, preventing Tyr-35 of TIMP-1 from H-bonding to the Phe-154 carbonyl, whereas in the L34G mutant structure the distance between oxygens is shortened from 3.5 to 3 Å. The H-bond between MMP-3 Tyr-155 and TIMP-1 Gly-34 is already present in the WT TIMP-1 complex with a distance of 2.6 Å between oxygens; however, the shift of the MMP-3 S-loop in the mutant complexes enables this short H-bond to be cinched even tighter in the TIMP-1 mutant complexes (Fig. 6). The TIMP-1-C1/MMP-3cd crystal structure reflects near-identical conformational changes in the TIMP-1 AB-loop and MMP-3cd S-loop, resulting from the L34G mutation, with consequent cinching of the reciprocal tyrosine clasp. In addition, mutations in the C-terminal domain of TIMP-1 produce significant conformational changes in this domain, the effect of which is to strengthen interactions both with the TIMP-1 N-terminal domain and with MMP-3cd. TIMP-1-C1 mutation G154A results in adoption of an α-helical conformation by residues 154–157 of the multiple-turn loop at the interface between the TIMP-1 N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 7, A, D, and E). Glycine, the native TIMP-1 residue at this position, is known to destabilize α-helical secondary structures (24Chakrabartty A. Schellman J.A. Baldwin R.L. Large differences in the helix propensities of alanine and glycine.Nature. 1991; 351 (2046766): 586-58810.1038/351586a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and each of the mutations of this residue identified in our library screen, to Ala, His, and Lys, are predicted to confer greater propensity for α-helix formation (25Blaber M. Zhang X.-J. Matthews B.W. Structural basis of amino acid α helix propensity.Science. 1993; 260 (8503008): 1637-164010.1126/science.8503008Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 26Pace C.N.

This alteration in secondary structure allows the two domains of TIMP-1 to pack together more tightly and introduces a new H-bond stabilizing the interdomain interaction (Fig. 7D). Additional conformational alterations in the TIMP-1-C1 structure result in closer contact with MMP-3cd, including hydrophobic contacts of TIMP-1-C1 Leu-152 with MMP-3 Thr-215, Tyr-220, and Leu-222 side chains (Fig. 7B) and a new intradomain H-bond between TIMP-1 residues Gln-150 and Pro-133 (Fig. 7C). In sum, the stabilizing effects of the mutations on TIMP-1 C-terminal domain secondary structure and on interdomain interactions serve to integrate the domains of this multidomain protein, producing functional cooperativity, which in turn improves MMP-3cd binding. Despite the common belief that the N-terminal domain of a TIMP is solely responsible for MMP binding and inhibition, here we have found that the C-terminal domain of TIMP-1 and the interplay between the two domains play a significant role in MMP-3 binding. We further have shown that not only the MMP-contacting interface but also the interactions between TIMP domains can be optimized in an integral fashion to achieve desired binding characteristics. Prior studies seeking to define and reshape the protease-inhibitory function of TIMPs have focused on the N-terminal domain due to the early finding that the isolated N-TIMP domain is independently capable of MMP inhibition with only modest loss of affinity compared with full-length TIMPs (7Murphy G.

https://openalex.org/W2943521585,"Poststroke recovery requires multiple repair mechanisms, including vascular remodeling and blood-brain barrier (BBB) restoration. Brain pericytes are essential for BBB repair and angiogenesis after stroke, but they also give rise to scar-forming platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR-β)-expressing cells. However, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying this pericyte response after stroke still remain unknown. Regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5) has been associated with pericyte detachment from the vascular wall, but whether it regulates pericyte function and vascular stabilization in the chronic phase of stroke is not known. Using RGS5-knockout (KO) mice, we study how loss of RGS5 affects the pericyte response and vascular remodeling in a stroke model at 7 d after ischemia. Loss of RGS5 leads to a shift toward an increase in the number of perivascular pericytes and reduction in the density of parenchymal PDGFR-β-expressing cells associated with normalized PDGFR-β activation after stroke. The redistribution of pericytes resulted in higher pericyte coverage, increased vascular density, preservation of vessel lengths, and a significant reduction in vascular leakage in RGS5-KO mice compared with controls. Our study demonstrates RGS5 in pericytes as an important target to enhance vascular remodeling.-Roth, M., Gaceb, A., Enström, A., Padel, T., Genové, G., Özen, I., Paul, G.

This posttranscriptional process diversifies a plethora of transcripts, including coding and noncoding RNAs. Interestingly, few studies have been carried out to determine the role of RNA editing in vascular disease. The aim of this study was to determine the potential role of ADARs in congenital heart disease. Strong downregulation of ADAR2 and increase in ADAR1 expression was observed in blood samples from congenital heart disease (CHD) patients. The decrease in expression of ADAR2 was in line with its downregulation in ventricular tissues of dilated cardiomyopathy patients. To further decipher the plausible regulatory pathway of ADAR2 with respect to heart physiology, miRNA profiling of ADAR2 was performed on tissues from ADAR2-/- mouse hearts. Downregulation of miRNAs (miR-29b, miR-405, and miR-19) associated with cardiomyopathy and cardiac fibrosis was observed. Moreover, the upregulation of miR-29b targets COL1A2 and IGF1, indicated that ADAR2 might be involved in cardiac myopathy. The ADAR2 target vascular development associated protein-coding gene filamin B (FLNB) was selected. The editing levels of FLNB were dramatically reduced in ADAR2-/- mice; however, no observable changes in FLNB expression were noted in ADAR2-/- mice compared to wild-type mice. This study proposes that sufficient ADAR2 enzyme activity might play a vital role in preventing cardiovascular defects."
https://openalex.org/W2942529532,"Introduction of alien fish is a major problem for the conservation of amphibians inhabiting originally fishless mountain streams. While fish eradication programs in lakes and ponds have proven successful for the recovery of amphibian populations, there is no such information for stream-dwelling amphibians, possibly because fish removal from streams is difficult and costly. Here, we show the first case of successful recovery of a stream-dwelling amphibian (Rana iberica) in a mountain area of central Spain, following eradication of introduced brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and native brown trout (Salmo trutta) translocated from downstream reaches by local anglers. Electrofishing for 12 consecutive years eradicated both fish species in the introduced area, and allowed the recovery of the R. iberica population as a result of natural recolonization from nearby streams and reintroduction of captive-reared individuals. Our results demonstrate how electrofishing can be a costly but effective method for the eradication of introduced fish and the conservation of stream-dwelling amphibians."

This dual relationship has not been examined in the same population. The objectives of this study are (1) to examine the relationship between baseline caries and changes in weight and height; and (2) to assess whether baseline weight and height are associated with changes in dental caries in a sample of preschool Chinese children. Children were recruited from 15 kindergarten in Liaoning Province at baseline (8 in rural area and 7 in urban area), a total of 1,111 of children were included at baseline. The mean age of children at baseline was 50.82 months. Data were collected through clinical oral examination, assessment of anthropometric measures and structured questionnaire. Dental caries was assessed according World Health Organization (WHO) methods by one dentist. Sociodemographic and behaviour data were also collected. At follow-up, 772 children were included (attrition rate: 30%), dental caries and anthropometric measures were assessed again. Z-score for weight-for-age and height-for-age were calculated using the 2006 and 2007 WHO Child Growth Standards. The sum of decayed, missing and filled primary teeth (dmft) were used in the analysis. Multilevel analysis for longitudinal data was conducted to explore the relationship between z-score for weight-for-age and height-for-age, and dental caries among children. The median follow-up time was 10.12 months. There was a significant negative association between dmft at baseline and change in height-for-age. On the other hand, weight-for-age at baseline was negatively associated with change in dmft at follow-up. The findings suggest that dental caries impedes children’s growth indicated by height for age. Low weight children appear to be more susceptible to dental caries in the same population."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence rate of ankle sprain and chronic ankle instability among rural adolescents and subsequently compare their physical activity levels based on ankle injury status. The study was conducted in a rural high school in North Carolina. High school students completed an online survey that assessed ankle injury history, perception of ankle instability and function, and physical activity. Respondents were categorized into one of four groups based on ankle injury history and complaints of instability: 1) uninjured (no history of injury); 2) unstable (history of injury >1 year and recurrent instability); 3) copers (history of injury >1 year and no recurrent instability); and 4) potentially unstable (injury within the past year). Frequency of physical activity was compared across groups using analysis of variance, Kruskall-Wallis test (α = 0.05), and responses to activity type were assessed using chi-square. Physical activity was found to differ significantly between the four groups with unstable respondents reporting more physical activity than uninjured respondents (unstable = 4706.05 ± 4610.56 MET-minutes/week; uninjured = 2592.93 ± 2946.02 MET-minutes/week). No differences were found between other groups. Despite injury history and sensations of instability, respondents with chronic ankle instability reported greater physical activity levels than uninjured participants. As this is contrary to pre-existing hypotheses, it is possible that continued physical activity after injury among adolescents may contribute to deleterious outcomes such as increased frequency of chronic instability."

The aim of this study was to identify factors that are associated with the occurrence of joint EIM and therefore allow an early diagnosis and guide medical treatment.We studied clinical and epidemiological data from 3298 patients included in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study (SIBDCS), 1860 suffered from Crohn's disease (CD) and 1438 from ulcerative colitis or IBD unclassified (UC/IBDU).We found female gender as well as a longer disease duration and activity (specified as CDAI or MTWAI, respectively) to be related to the appearance of arthritis/arthralgia, but also sacroiliitis/ankylosing spondylitis in IBD patients. IBD patients with arthritis/arthralgia or sacroiliitis/ankylosing spondylitis were more often treated with anti-TNF and patients with arthritis/arthralgia underwent more often IBD-related surgeries. We revealed that eye or skin EIM were more frequent in patients with arthritis/arthralgia or sacroiliitis/ankylosing spondylitis. In multivariate analysis, we confirmed female gender, longer disease duration, IBD-related surgery, presence of other EIM and treatment with anti-TNF to be independent risk factors for the onset of arthritis/arthralgia in CD and UC/IBDU patients.In this study, we demonstrated that markers for a more severe disease course were associated with the onset of joint EIM in IBD patients. Our data suggest that in particular females under anti-TNF treatment and patients suffering from non-joint and/or IBD-related surgery should be close and carefully monitored for presence of arthritis or sacroiliitis/ankylosing spondylitis."
https://openalex.org/W2943634132,"Ribonuclease 1 (RNase1) is a circulating extracellular endonuclease that regulates the vascular homeostasis of extracellular RNA and acts as a vessel- and tissue-protective enzyme. Upon long-term inflammation, high amounts of proinflammatory cytokines affect endothelial cell (EC) function by down-regulation of RNase1. Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of RNase1 upon inflammation in HUVECs. TNF-α or IL-1β stimulation reduced the expression of RNase1 relative to the acetylation state of histone 3 at lysine 27 and histone 4 of the RNASE1 promoter. Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1, 2, and 3 by the specific class I HDAC inhibitor MS275 abolished the TNF-α- or IL-1β-mediated effect on the mRNA and chromatin levels of RNase1. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation kinetics revealed that HDAC2 accumulates at the RNASE1 promoter upon TNF-α stimulation, indicating an essential role for HDAC2 in regulating RNase1 expression. Thus, proinflammatory stimulation induced recruitment of HDAC2 to attenuate histone acetylation at the RNASE1 promoter site. Consequently, treatment with HDAC inhibitors may provide a new therapeutic strategy to stabilize vascular homeostasis in the context of inflammation by preventing RNase1 down-regulation in ECs.-Bedenbender, K., Scheller, N., Fischer, S., Leiting, S., Preissner, K.

https://openalex.org/W2796801442,"Scientific research is often thought of as being conducted by individuals and small teams striving for disciplinary advances. Yet as a whole, this endeavor more closely resembles a complex and integrated system of people, papers, and ideas. Studies of co-authorship and citation networks have revealed important structural properties of researchers and articles, but currently the structure of scientific ideas themselves is not well understood. In this study, we posit that topic networks may be a useful framework for revealing the nature of conceptual relationships. Using this framework, we map the landscape of interconnected research topics covered in the multidisciplinary journal PNAS since 2000, constructing networks in which nodes represent topics of study and edges give the extent to which topics occur in the same papers. The network displays small-world architecture, characterized by regions of dense local connectivity with sparse connectivity between them. In this network, dense local connectivity additionally gives rise to distinct clusters of related topics. Yet notably, these clusters tend not to align with assigned article classifications, and instead contain topics from various disciplines. Using a temporal graph, we find that small-worldness has increased over time, suggesting growing efficiency and integration of ideas. Finally, we define two measures of interdisciplinarity, one of which is found to be positively associated with PNAS’s impact factor. Broadly, this work suggests that complex and dynamic patterns of knowledge emerge from scientific research, and that structures reflecting intellectual integration may be beneficial for obtaining scientific insight."

The current study investigated short-term effects of using Walkasins, an external lower-limb sensory neuroprosthesis, on clinical outcomes of balance and gait in persons who reported peripheral neuropathy and balance problems. The device replaces lost plantar sensation with tactile balance information that modulates cutaneous mechanoreceptors above the ankle where sensation is intact. Thirty-one male community-dwelling Veterans, 56–84 years old with insensate feet and balance problems participated. Initial Functional Gait Assessment, gait speed, and 4-Stage Balance Test outcomes were assessed. After initial assessment, subjects were randomly assigned to either wearing Walkasins turned ON, or OFF, and outcomes were re-assessed following a set of standardized balance exercises. Following a one-hour rest and washout period, treatments were crossed-over between groups and a third outcomes assessment was performed. Before cross-over, 10 of 15 subjects in the ON-then-OFF group improved their Functional Gait Assessment score by at least four points, the Minimal Clinically Important Difference, compared to 5 of 16 in the OFF-then-ON group. After cross-over, 7 of 16 subjects in the OFF-then-ON group improved by at least four points versus 2 of 15 in the ON-then-OFF group. ON treatment was associated with a Functional Gait Assessment improvement of 4.4 ± 3.7 points versus 1.5 ± 1.2 for the OFF treatment (p<0.01). Overall, Functional Gait Assessment scores changed from 15.2 ± 4.8 at initial assessment to 21.1 ± 5.2 after final assessment (p<0.001). At the end of the two treatment sessions, 16 of the 31 individuals had improved their Functional Gait Assessment score beyond 23, indicating normal fall-risk status. Future studies should investigate long-term benefits of the device to reduce fall risk and actual falls in patients with peripheral neuropathy and balance problems."

Analysis of a near-complete genome sequence of the ossamycin producer has allowed the identification of the 127-kbp ossamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. The presence in the cluster of a specific crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase homologue suggests that the 5-methylhexanoate extension unit used in construction of the macrocyclic core is incorporated intact from the unusual precursor isobutyrylmalonyl-CoA. Surprisingly, the modular polyketide synthase uses only 14 extension modules to accomplish 15 cycles of polyketide chain extension, a rare example of programmed iteration on a modular polyketide synthase. Specific deletion of genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes has given insight into the late-stage tailoring of the ossamycin macrocycle required for the attachment of the unusual 2,3,4,6-deoxyaminohexose sugar l-ossamine to C-8 of the ossamycin macrocycle. The ossamycin cluster also encodes a putative spirocyclase enzyme, OssO, which may play a role in establishing the characteristic spiroketal moiety of the natural product."

The eye-tracking system is a proven method for assessing decision-making processes that have been used in different fields of science. Our aim was to evaluate the lifeguards’ capacity to perform the ABCDE (Airway-Breathing-Circulation-Disability-Exposure) approach when facing a simulated critically ill-drowned victim. Methods A cross-sectional simulation study was designed to assess the skills and sequence of the ABCDE approach by 20 professional lifeguards. They had to assess a victim and act according to his/her clinical status by following the ABCDE primary assessment approach. The two kinds of variables were recorder: those related to the quality of each step of the ABCDE approach and the visual behaviour using a portable eye-movement system. The eye-tracking system was the Mobile Eye system (Bedford, USA). Results None of the study participants were able to complete correctly the ABCDE approach. Lifeguards spent more time in the Circulation step: Airway (15.5±11.1 s), Breathing (25.1±21.1 s), Circulation (44.6±29.5 s), Disability (38.5±0.7 s). Participants spent more time in viewpoints considered as important (65.5±17.4 s) compared with secondary ones (34.6±17.4 s, p = 0.008). This was also represented in the percentage of visual fixations (fixations in important viewpoints: 63.36±15.06; fixation in secondary viewpoints: 36.64±15.06; p = 0.008). Conclusion Professional lifeguards failed to fully perform the ABCDE sequence. Evaluation by experts with the help of eye-tracking technology detected the lifeguards’ limitations in the assessment and treatment of an eventual critically ill victim. Such deficits should be considered in the design and implementation of lifeguards’ training programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2942704082,"Introduction Cervical cancer is a major public health problem in developing countries like Ethiopia. Cervical cancer screening service has been offered to high-risk groups in Ethiopia since 2013. However, there is no evidence on the willingness to pay for the screening. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the female health professionals’ willingness to pay for cervical cancer screening at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study design was used to assess the health professionals’ willingness to pay for the cervical screening from March to April, 2018. Simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants from a list of female health professionals who has been working for the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar. The data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and exported to STATA version 14 for analysis. Tobit models were used to identify factors which had statistical significant association with willingness to pay for cervical cancer screening service. Results A total of 392 respondents participated in the study with a response rate of 92.7%. The majority (83.4%) of participants were willing to pay for cervical cancer screening. The average amount of money they were willing to pay was ETB 194.7 (US$7.16) per service. Age ≥ 30 years, educational status, perceived seriousness of cervical cancer, perceived quality of cervical cancer screening service and monthly income were significantly associated with willingness to pay for cervical cancer screening. Conclusion High proportion of study participants were willing to pay for cervical cancer screening. Therefore, the policy makers can scale-up cervical cancer screening by setting appropriate fee for service charge. They can also raise awareness of cervical cancer and offer quality service in order to increase the benefits of the program."
https://openalex.org/W2942732466,"Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is an important step in melanoma staging and prognostication. It is commonly performed for patients with intermediate thickness melanomas, based on clinicopathological features. However, only 20-25% of patients eventually demonstrate nodal involvement. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether tissue biomarkers with links to melanoma biology, together with clinicopathological parameters, could aid in the prediction of sentinel node involvement and improve selection of patients for SNB. In addition, we examined the role of these clinical or biological markers in disease outcome.We collected a case-control cohort of 140 intermediate thickness (Breslow 0,9-4,0mm) melanoma patients with or without SNB involvement matched for age, gender, Breslow thickness and location. From this cohort, we tested the predictive value of common clinicopathological parameters (ulceration, mitotic count and tumor regression) and FMNL-2, ezrin and BRAF V600E immunoreactivity, for sentinel node involvement and survival. We further analyzed the correlations in the superficial spreading melanoma subtype.Based on our case control analysis, of the markers, BRAF V600E status (p = 0.010) and mitotic count (p = 0.036) correlated with SNB involvement. SNB status was a strong independent prognosticator for recurrence free survival (RFS p<0.001), melanoma specific survival (MSS p = 0.000) and overall survival (OS p = 0.029). In the superficially spreading melanoma subgroup, BRAF V600E positivity indicated poorer RFS (p = 0.039) and OS (p = 0.012). By combining the Breslow thickness, mitotic count and BRAF immunohistochemistry, we identified a group of superficially spreading melanomas with an excellent survival probability independent of SNB status.These results demonstrate that BRAF immunohistochemistry could serve as a useful addition to a marker panel for selecting intermediate thickness melanoma patients for SNB."
https://openalex.org/W2943204760,"Purpose End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients exhibit silent white-matter alterations after long-term hemodialysis, which may be due to ESRD itself or the hemodialysis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the longitudinal white-matter alterations in the ESRD patients under 3-year long-term hemodialysis using voxel-wise analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Materials and methods 15 ESRD patients and 15 age-matched healthy controls participated in this study. Due to the development of abnormal brain lesions in some cases, 13 ESRD patients and 13 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled and underwent cognitive function assessment and DTI acquisition at two-time points separated by 3 years. Voxel-based analysis was performed to globally detect white-matter alterations between the two groups as well as between the two scans within the two groups. Results In the ESRD patients, diffusivity indices were significantly increased and the fractional anisotropy was significantly decreased in both scans, as compared with healthy controls. Longitudinal comparisons showed significant white-matter alterations in healthy controls in three years, but little or no significant alterations were noted in the ESRD patients after additional 3-year hemodialysis. Conclusion Poorer white matter integrity and cognitive function are noted in ESRD patients and the toxic effect of ESRD may be the major factor of white matter alterations."

A total of 35 S. suis serotypes (SS) have been identified and genotyped into > 700 sequence types (ST) by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Eurasian ST1 isolates are the most virulent of all S. suis SS2 strains while North American ST25 and ST28 strains display moderate to low/no virulence phenotypes, respectively. Notably, S. suis 90–1330 is an avirulent Canadian SS2-ST28 isolate producing a lantibiotic bacteriocin with potential prophylactic applications. To investigate the suitability of this strain for such purposes, we sequenced its complete genome using the Illumina and PacBio platforms. The S. suis 90–1330 bacteriocin was found encoded in a locus cargoed in what appears to be an integrative and conjugative element (ICE). This bacteriocin locus was also found to be widely distributed across several streptococcal species and in a few Staphylococcus aureus strains. Because the locus also confers protection from the bacteriocin, the potential prophylactic benefits of using this strain may prove limited due to the spread of the resistance to its effects. Furthermore, the S. suis 90–1330 genome was found to code for genes involved in blood survival, suggesting that strain may not be a benign as previously thought."

The average intensities of head, bone and/or joints, back, chest, abdomen, neck and/or shoulder, general muscle, and limb pain in the past week were evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). At follow-up, active headache was defined as a score on the VAS > 3. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate the associations of migraine at baseline with other PPS at follow-up.Compared with the migraine with inactive headache group and the non-migraine group, patients with migraine with active headache had significantly higher intensities of other PPS and a lower remission rate of depression. There were no significant differences in the pain intensities of the other seven PPS between the migraine with inactive headache group and the non-migraine group. Headache intensity was significantly correlated with the intensities of other PPS at baseline and follow-up. Migraine with active headache independently predicted other PPS after controlling for depression and anxiety at baseline.Migraine with active headache among MDD patients could predict other PPS. Prevention and treatment of headache might help to decrease other PPS and improve the prognosis of depression. Integration of treatment for depression and headache is indicated."

However, the mechanism for HIRA complex deposition of H3.3/H4 into nucleosomes remains unclear. Here, we characterize a central region of UBN1 (UBN1 middle domain) that is evolutionarily conserved and predicted to have helical secondary structure. We report that the UBN1 middle domain has dimer formation activity and binds to H3/H4 in a manner that does not discriminate between H3.1 and H3.3. We additionally identify a nearby DNA-binding domain in UBN1, located between the UBN1 HRD and middle domain, which binds DNA through electrostatic contacts involving several conserved lysine residues. Together, these observations suggest a mechanism for HIRA-mediated H3.3/H4 deposition whereby UBN1 associates with DNA and dimerizes to mediate formation of an (H3.3/H4)2 heterotetramer prior to chromatin deposition.

https://openalex.org/W2943060808,"Cholinesterases (ChE), the enzymes whose primary function is the hydrolysis of choline esters, are widely expressed throughout the nature. Although they have already been found in plants and microorganisms, including ascomycete fungi, this study is the first report of ChE-like activity in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. This activity was detected in almost a quarter of the 45 tested aqueous fungal extracts. The ability of these extracts to hydrolyse acetylthiocholine was about ten times stronger than the hydrolytic activity towards butyrylthiocholine and propionylthiocholine. In-gel detection of ChE-like activity with acetylthiocholine indicated a great variability in the characteristics of these enzymes which are not characterized as vertebrate-like based on (i) differences in inhibition by excess substrate, (ii) susceptibility to different vertebrate acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors, and (iii) a lack of orthologs using phylogenetic analysis. Limited inhibition by single inhibitors and multiple activity bands using in-gel detection indicate the presence of several ChE-like enzymes in these aqueous extracts. We also observed inhibitory activity of the same aqueous mushroom extracts against insect acetylcholinesterase in 10 of the 45 samples tested; activity was independent of the presence of ChE-like activity in extracts. Both ChE-like activities with different substrates and the ability of extracts to inhibit insect acetylcholinesterase were not restricted to any fungal family but were rather present across all included Basidiomycota families. This study can serve as a platform for further research regarding ChE activity in mushrooms."
https://openalex.org/W2943103545,"Chronotype (morningness/eveningness) is associated with preference for the timing of many types of behavior, most notably sleep. Chronotype is also associated with differences in the timing of various physiologic events as well as aspects of personality. One aspect linked to personality, prosocial behavior, has not been studied before in the context of chronotype. There are many variables contributing to who, when, and why one human might help another and some of these factors appear fixed, while some change over time or with the environment. It was our intent to examine prosocial behavior in the context of chronotype and environment.Randomly selected adults (N = 100, ages 18-72) were approached in a public space and asked to participate in a study. If the participants consented (n = 81), they completed the reduced Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, then prosocial behavior was assessed.We found that people exhibited greater prosocial behavior when they were studied further from their preferred time of day. This did not appear to be associated with subjective sleepiness or other environmental variables, such as ambient illumination. This suggests the importance of appreciating the differentiation between the same individual's prosocial behavior at different times of day. Future studies should aim at replicating this result in larger samples and across other measures of prosocial behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2943167159,"Canine cutaneous leishmaniasis (CCL) is a zoonosis of public health interest, and in the Americas, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis has been identified as the main etiological agent. The present study sought to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs from a rural area of the Xapuri municipality, Acre state, Brazilian Amazonia. For this purpose, visits were carried out to domiciles where the human cases of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) occurred, followed by the clinical evaluation of the animals in search of clinical signs suggestive of CCL. Blood samples were collected from 40 dogs, 13 of which had lesions suggestive of CCL, and biopsies of these lesions were performed. The methods used were Neal, Novy, and Nicolle's (NNN) medium cultures and direct parasitological examination. Further, to detect and characterize Leishmania DNA some molecular techniques were performed such as conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing targeting SSU rDNA and ITS1, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and high resolution melting (HRM) analysis targeting hsp70. The investigation revealed that the results obtained from the parasitological methods were negative. In PCR by ITS1 and network topology sequences, six strains from dogs, isolated from the Peruvian Andes, appeared identical to Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis type 2 (99-100%). By other molecular methods these samples turned out to be positive to Leishmania (Viannia) sp.. The diagnosis of Leishmania in domestic dogs from Acre state showed a high proportion of infected animals, and the occurrence of L. braziliensis type 2 in Brazil for the first time. This new report suggests that L. braziliensis type 2 is both trans- and cis-Andean. However, more studies are needed regarding the clinical and diagnostic aspects of this species of Leishmania."
https://openalex.org/W2943268232,"The ability to identify mixed-species infections and track the origin of Plasmodium parasites can further enhance the development of treatment and prevention recommendations as well as outbreak investigations. Here, we explore the utility of using the full Plasmodium mitochondrial genome to classify Plasmodium species, detect mixed infections, and infer the geographical origin of imported P. falciparum parasites to the United States (U.S.). Using the recently developed standardized, high-throughput Malaria Resistance Surveillance (MaRS) protocol, the full Plasmodium mitochondrial genomes of 265 malaria cases imported to the U.S. from 2014–2017 were sequenced and analyzed. P. falciparum infections were found in 94.7% (251/265) of samples. Five percent (14/265) of samples were identified as mixed- Plasmodium species or non-P. falciparum, including P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale curtisi, and P. ovale wallikeri. P. falciparum mitochondrial haplotypes analysis revealed greater than eighteen percent of samples to have at least two P. falciparum mitochondrial genome haplotypes, indicating either heteroplasmy or multi-clonal infections. Maximum-likelihood phylogenies of 912 P. falciparum mitochondrial genomes with known country origin were used to infer the geographical origin of thirteen samples from persons with unknown travel histories as: Africa (country unspecified) (n = 10), Ghana (n = 1), Southeast Asia (n = 1), and the Philippines (n = 1). We demonstrate the utility and current limitations of using the Plasmodium mitochondrial genome to classify samples with mixed-infections and infer the geographical origin of imported P. falciparum malaria cases to the U.S. with unknown travel history."
https://openalex.org/W2943337853,"Aim To provide a Portuguese version of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP), investigating its validity and reliability in Brazilian patients with COPD. Methods This was a cross-sectional study for translation and linguist validation of the Portuguese MDP version for patients with COPD. The process occurred according to the protocol of Mapi Research Trust, Lyon, France. Three scores of MDP were used for the analysis: the immediate unpleasantness of dyspnea (A1); the “immediate perception domain” (S) (sum of A1 plus the sensory descriptors) and the “emotional response domain” (A2) (sum of the emotional descriptors). The questionnaires COPD assessment Test (CAT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and Medical Research Council scale (MRC) were used as anchors to investigate MDP’s validity. Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach’s alpha. Test–retest reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concurrent validity was assessed with Spearman correlation coefficients. Results Thirty patients with moderate-severe COPD were studied for MDP’s validation analysis (43% male, 63±8years, body mass index [BMI] 27±6Kg/m2, forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1] 48±15%predicted, six-minute walking test [6MWT] 464±84m and 84±16%predicted), whereas 10 patients were excluded from the test-retest reliability analysis due to missing data, resulting in a sample of 20 subjects for this purpose (50% male, 62±8years, BMI 27±6Kg/m2, FEV1 48±15%predicted, 6MWT 452±93m and 82±19%predicted). Both samples were similar regarding general characteristics (P>0,05 for all variables). MDP presented strong correlations, i.e., ICC intra-rater: A1: 0.77 (0.48–0.90), S: 0.78 (0.52–0.91), and A2: 0.85 (0.66–0.94), with high internal consistency (Cronbach's α 0.86, 0.88 and 0.92 respectively); and ICC inter-rater: A1: 0.74 (0.46–0.89), S: 0.75 (0.48–0.89) and A2: 0.91 (0.78–0.96) with Cronbach's α 0.85, 0.86 and 0.95 respectively. Conclusion The Portuguese version of the MDP is the first valid and reliable instrument to assess dyspnea multidimensionally in Portuguese-speaking patients with COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2943498305,"Objectives Occupational exposures significantly contribute to the risk of adverse cancer outcomes, and firefighters face many carcinogenic exposures. Occupational research using cancer registry data, however, is limited by missing and inaccurate occupation-related fields. The objective of this study is to determine the frequency and predictors of missing and inaccurate occupation data for a cohort of career firefighters in a state cancer registry. Methods We conducted a linkage between data from the Florida Cancer Data System (1981–2014) and the Florida State Fire Marshal’s Office (1972–2012). The percentage and the odds of having a firefighting-related occupation code in the cancer record were calculated, adjusting for other occupation and cancer-related factors. Results Among 3,928 career firefighters, nearly half (47%) were missing a registry-dervived occupation code and only 17% had a firefighting-related code. Males were more likely to have a firefighting-related code (OR = 2.31;95%CI: 1.41–3.76), as were those with more recent diagnoses (OR1992-2002 = 2.98;95%CI: 1.57–5.67; OR2003-2014 = 11.40;95%CI: 6.17–21.03), and those of younger ages (OR45-64y = 1.26;95%CI: 1.03–1.54; OR20-44y = 2.26;95%CI: 1.73–2.95). Conclusions Accurate occupation data is key for identifying increased risk of advserse cancer outcomes. Cancer registry occupation fields, however, are overwhelmingly missing for firefighters and are missing disproportionally by sociodemographic and diagnosis characteristics. This study highlights the lack of accurate occupation data available for hypothesis-driven cancer research. Cancer registry linkage with external occupational data sources represents an essential resource for conducting studies among at-risk populations such as firefighters."
https://openalex.org/W2943512163,"Glutathione is an endogenous antioxidant found in oxidized (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) forms. Glutathione depletion is indicative of oxidative stress and occurs in various pathological conditions and following extreme exercise activity. Raising blood glutathione concentration has potential to attenuate and prevent chronic disease and also to improve recovery from exercise. There are a number of challenges to achieving this through traditional dietary supplements, and thus there is a need to develop optimized delivery methods to improve blood glutathione status. This study evaluated the effect of a novel glutathione formulation on blood glutathione parameters in healthy individuals.15 (8 male) healthy individuals (25±5y old, 78.0±14.6kg) participated in a single-blinded randomized placebo-controlled crossover study, with a minimum one-week washout period between treatments. Participants were overnight fasted and administered 1mL of a non-liposomal nano-size glutathione solution (NLNG) containing 200mg of glutathione or 1mL of placebo lacking glutathione. The solution was held in the mouth for 90 seconds before the remainder was swallowed. Blood was collected at baseline, 5, 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes post-treatment. Protein-bound plasma and erythrocyte lysate concentrations of GSH and GSSG were measured at all time points using previously validated procedures. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare differences between baseline and post-treatment glutathione concentrations between NLNG and placebo for each parameter.There was a significant main effect for treatment type, such that increases in GSH concentration in erythrocyte lysate were greater following NLNG than placebo (p = 0.001). Similar significant main effects for treatment were also found for total (protein bound + erythrocyte lysate) GSH (p = 0.015) and GSSG (p = 0.037) concentration, as well as total blood glutathione pool (GSH+GSSG, p = 0.006).NLNG increased multiple blood glutathione parameters compared to placebo. Future research should examine whether NLNG can attenuate oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2943310922,"To examine how stratifying persons born outside Canada according to tuberculosis (TB) incidence in their birth country and other demographic factors refines our understanding of TB epidemiology and local TB transmission.Population-level TB surveillance programs and research studies in low incidence settings often report all persons born outside the country in which the study is conducted as ""foreign-born""-a single label for a highly diverse population with variable TB risks. This may mask important TB epidemiologic trends and not accurately reflect local transmission patterns.We used population-level data from two large cohorts in British Columbia (BC), Canada: an immigration cohort (n = 337,492 permanent residents to BC) and a genotyping cohort (n = 2290 culture-confirmed active TB cases). We stratified active TB case counts, incidence rates, and genotypic clustering (an indicator of TB transmission) in BC by birth country TB incidence, age at immigration, and years since arrival.Persons from high-incidence countries had a 12-fold higher TB incidence than those emigrating from low-incidence settings. Estimates of local transmission, as captured by genotyping, versus reactivation of latent TB infection acquired outside Canada varied when data were stratified by birthplace TB incidence, as did patient-level characteristics of individuals in each group, such as age and years between immigration and diagnosis.Categorizing persons beyond simply ""foreign-born"", particularly in the context of TB epidemiologic and molecular data, is needed for a more accurate understanding of TB rates and patterns of transmission."

Plastic waste is a major and growing global concern. Here we describe a new cell culture dish that offers a culture area equivalent to three petri dishes but that is on average 61% lighter and occupies 67% less volume. Our dish is composed of a lid and three thin containers surrounded by a light outer shell. Cell culture can be performed in each of the containers sequentially. The outer shell provides the appropriate structure for the manipulation of the dish as a whole. The prototype was tested by sequentially growing cells in each of its containers. As a control, sequential cultures in groups of 3 petri dishes were performed. No statistical differences were found between the prototype and the control in terms of cell number, cell viability or cell distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2942808715,"For most complex traits, the majority of SNPs identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reside within noncoding regions that have no known function. However, these regions are enriched for the regulatory enhancers specific to the cells relevant to the specific trait. Indeed, many of the GWAS loci that have been functionally characterized lie within enhancers that regulate expression levels of key genes. In order to identify polymorphisms with potential allele-specific regulatory effects, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline that harnesses epigenetic signatures as well as transcription factor (TF) binding motifs to identify putative enhancers containing a SNP with potential allele-specific TF binding in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a GWAS-identified SNP. We applied the approach to GWAS findings for blood lipids, revealing 7 putative enhancers harboring associated SNPs, 3 of which lie within the introns of LCAT and ABCA1, genes that play crucial roles in cholesterol biogenesis and lipoprotein metabolism. All 3 enhancers demonstrated allele-specific in vitro regulatory activity in liver-derived cell lines. We demonstrated that these putative enhancers are in close physical proximity to the promoters of their respective genes, in situ, likely through chromatin looping. In addition, the associated alleles altered the likelihood of transcription activator STAT3 binding. Our results demonstrate that through our approach, the LD blocks that contain GWAS signals, often hundreds of kilobases in size with multiple SNPs serving as statistical proxies to the true functional site, can provide an experimentally testable hypothesis for the underlying regulatory mechanism linking genetic variants to complex traits."

However, few studies have compared the emotional mechanisms activated by loved faces and names and none have simultaneously examined fMRI and autonomic measures. The present study combined fMRI with the heart rate response when 21 participants (10 males) passively viewed the face or the written name of 4 loved people and 4 unknown people. The results showed accelerative patterns in heart rate, together with brain activations, which were significantly higher for loved people than for unknown people. Significant correlations were found between heart rate and brain activation in frontal areas, for faces, and in temporal areas, for names. The results are discussed in the context of previous studies using the same passive viewing procedure, highlighting the relevance of integrating peripheral and central measures in the scientific study of positive emotion and love."
https://openalex.org/W2943160378,"Assessing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) viability by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) microscopy can predict TB culture results, treatment response and infectiousness. However, diverse methods have been published. We aimed to optimise FDA microscopy, minimising sputum processing, biohazard and complexity for use in resource-constrained settings.Optimization: Patients with smear-positive pulmonary TB before treatment and healthy control participants provided sputa. These were divided into equal aliquots that were tested directly or after NaOH centrifuge-decontamination. Each aliquot was cultured and used to prepare slides (n = 80). FDA microscopy used: 1 or 3 drops of sputum; with/out acid-alcohol wash; with/out phenol sterilization; with 0/30/60 seconds KMnO4 quenching. Control samples all had negative culture and microscopy results. FDA microscopy had higher sensitivity when performed directly (without centrifuge-decontamination) on 1 drop of sputum (P<0.001), because 3 drops obscured microscopy. Acid-alcohol wash and KMnO4 quenching made bacilli easier to identity (P = 0.005). Phenol sterilization did not impair microscopy (P>0.1). Validation: The 2 protocols that performed best in the optimization experiments were reassessed operationally by comparing duplicate slides (n = 412) stained with KMnO4 quenching for 30 versus 60 seconds. FDA microscopy results were similar (P = 0.4) and highly reproducible, with 97% of counts agreeing within +/-1 logarithm. Storage: Smear microscopy slides and aliquots of the sputum from which they were made were stored for 4 weeks. Twice-weekly, paired slides (n = 80) were stained with freshly prepared versus stored FDA and read quantitatively. Storing sputum, microscopy slides or FDA solution at 4°C or room temperature had no effect on FDA microscopy results (all P>0.2). Cost: Material costs for each slide tested by FDA microscopy using reagents purchased locally were USD $0.05 and required the same equipment, time and skills as auramine acid-fast microscopy.We recommend a simple, bio-secure protocol for FDA microscopy that provides sensitive and repeatable results without requiring centrifugation."

https://openalex.org/W2943321962,"What concepts and words do communicative gestures activate in the minds of people who view them? It's widely believed that many gestures grow from iconic origins-they look like what they mean-but also that at some point they may become emblematic-conventionalized as culturally agreed-upon symbols. How long do links between physical movements of the body and the things in the world they denote persist in the minds of gesture-users? A pair of experiments asks this question for the Middle-Finger, a cross-culturally recognized obscene gesture. The prevailing view is that the gesture originates in a phallic symbol. Yet it is now predominantly used as an emblematic gesture displaying contempt (among other things). It is currently unknown whether the iconic origins of gestures persist through the emblematic stage in the minds of gesture users. Two experiments tested the hypothesis that viewing the Middle-Finger primes thoughts about penises or the word penis. The results showed that the Middle-Finger induced no priming of penis compared with control, unlike another obscene penis-representing gesture (Finger-Bang), which did. This suggests that the Middle-Finger no longer activates thoughts of penises in the minds of contemporary American English speakers. Emblematic gestures with iconic origins may undergo historical change not just in the functions they serve but also in the effects they have on the minds of people who use them."
