https://openalex.org/W2951325776,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 100 risk loci for schizophrenia, but the causal mechanisms remain largely unknown. We performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) integrating a schizophrenia GWAS of 79,845 individuals from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium with expression data from brain, blood, and adipose tissues across 3,693 primarily control individuals. We identified 157 TWAS-significant genes, of which 35 did not overlap a known GWAS locus. Of these 157 genes, 42 were associated with specific chromatin features measured in independent samples, thus highlighting potential regulatory targets for follow-up. Suppression of one identified susceptibility gene, mapk3, in zebrafish showed a significant effect on neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Expression and splicing from the brain captured most of the TWAS effect across all genes. This large-scale connection of associations to target genes, tissues, and regulatory features is an essential step in moving toward a mechanistic understanding of GWAS. A transcriptome-wide association study integrating genome-wide association data with expression data from brain, blood and adipose tissues identifies new candidate susceptibility genes for schizophrenia, providing a step toward understanding the underlying biology."

https://openalex.org/W2798230823,"Efforts to develop drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown promise in animal studies, only to fail in human trials, suggesting a pressing need to study AD in human model systems. Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD. Human iPSC-derived neurons are generated from individuals with or without Alzheimer's disease carrying different APOE alleles and reveal a toxic, neuron-intrinsic gain of function of the ApoE4 variant that is a strong genetic risk factor for AD."

This longitudinal study seeks to advance understanding regarding implications of systemic maternal inflammation during pregnancy, indexed by plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations, for large-scale brain system development and emerging executive function skills in offspring. We assessed maternal IL-6 during pregnancy, functional magnetic resonance imaging acquired in neonates, and working memory (an important component of executive function) at 2 years of age. Functional connectivity within and between multiple neonatal brain networks can be modeled to estimate maternal IL-6 concentrations during pregnancy. Brain regions heavily weighted in these models overlap substantially with those supporting working memory in a large meta-analysis. Maternal IL-6 also directly accounts for a portion of the variance of working memory at 2 years of age. Findings highlight the association of maternal inflammation during pregnancy with the developing functional architecture of the brain and emerging executive function. The authors show that maternal inflammation during pregnancy, indexed by IL-6, can be estimated from the newborn brain connectome and predicts future working memory performance in offspring at two years of age."

https://openalex.org/W2796625358,"The phytohormone jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) regulates defense, growth and developmental responses in vascular plants. Bryophytes have conserved sequences for all JA-Ile signaling pathway components but lack JA-Ile. We show that, in spite of 450 million years of independent evolution, the JA-Ile receptor COI1 is functionally conserved between the bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha and the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana but COI1 responds to different ligands in each species. We identified the ligand of Marchantia MpCOI1 as two isomeric forms of the JA-Ile precursor dinor-OPDA (dinor-cis-OPDA and dinor-iso-OPDA). We demonstrate that AtCOI1 functionally complements Mpcoi1 mutation and confers JA-Ile responsiveness and that a single-residue substitution in MpCOI1 is responsible for the evolutionary switch in ligand specificity. Our results identify the ancestral bioactive jasmonate and clarify its biosynthetic pathway, demonstrate the functional conservation of its signaling pathway, and show that JA-Ile and COI1 emergence in vascular plants required co-evolution of hormone biosynthetic complexity and receptor specificity. The jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) receptor COI1 is functionally conserved between the bryophyte Marchantia polymopha and the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana, with two isomers of the JA-Ile precursor dinor-OPDA acting as the ligand for Marchantia COI1."
https://openalex.org/W2796811655,"Individual risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is modified by perturbations to the mass, distribution and function of adipose tissue. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these associations, we explored the molecular, cellular and whole-body effects of T2D-associated alleles near KLF14. We show that KLF14 diabetes-risk alleles act in adipose tissue to reduce KLF14 expression and modulate, in trans, the expression of 385 genes. We demonstrate, in human cellular studies, that reduced KLF14 expression increases pre-adipocyte proliferation but disrupts lipogenesis, and in mice, that adipose tissue–specific deletion of Klf14 partially recapitulates the human phenotype of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and T2D. We show that carriers of the KLF14 T2D risk allele shift body fat from gynoid stores to abdominal stores and display a marked increase in adipocyte cell size, and that these effects on fat distribution, and the T2D association, are female specific. The metabolic risk associated with variation at this imprinted locus depends on the sex both of the subject and of the parent from whom the risk allele derives. Analysis of the imprinted KLF14 locus shows that the type 2 diabetes risk alleles in this region act in adipocytes to reduce KLF14 expression and modulate the expression of almost 400 genes in trans, leading to a shift in body-fat distribution and insulin resistance specifically in females."
https://openalex.org/W2797554353,"‘Sundowning’ in dementia and Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by early-evening agitation and aggression. While such periodicity suggests a circadian origin, whether the circadian clock directly regulates aggressive behavior is unknown. We demonstrate that a daily rhythm in aggression propensity in male mice is gated by GABAergic subparaventricular zone (SPZGABA) neurons, the major postsynaptic targets of the central circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Optogenetic mapping revealed that SPZGABA neurons receive input from vasoactive intestinal polypeptide suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons and innervate neurons in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which is known to regulate aggression. Additionally, VMH-projecting dorsal SPZ neurons are more active during early day than early night, and acute chemogenetic inhibition of SPZGABA transmission phase-dependently increases aggression. Finally, SPZGABA-recipient central VMH neurons directly innervate ventrolateral VMH neurons, and activation of this intra-VMH circuit drove attack behavior. Altogether, we reveal a functional polysynaptic circuit by which the suprachiasmatic nucleus clock regulates aggression. Todd et al. show a daily rhythm in aggression propensity in male mice and reveal a novel polysynaptic circuit within the hypothalamus by which the central circadian clock (the suprachiasmatic nucleus) influences neurons that regulate attack behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2797311248,"Ribosomal surveillance pathways scan for ribosomes that are transiently paused or terminally stalled owing to structural elements in mRNAs or nascent chain sequences1, 2. Some stalls in budding yeast are sensed by the GTPase Hbs1, which loads Dom34, a catalytically inactive member of the archaeo-eukaryotic release factor 1 superfamily. Hbs1-Dom34 and the ATPase Rli1 dissociate stalled ribosomes into 40S and 60S subunits. However, the 60S subunits retain the peptidyl-tRNA nascent chains, which recruit the ribosome quality control complex that consists of Rqc1-Rqc2-Ltn1-Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4. Nascent chains ubiquitylated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1 are extracted from the 60S subunit by the ATPase Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 and presented to the 26S proteasome for degradation3-9. Failure to degrade the nascent chains leads to protein aggregation and proteotoxic stress in yeast and neurodegeneration in mice10-14. Despite intensive investigations on the ribosome quality control pathway, it is not known how the tRNA is hydrolysed from the ubiquitylated nascent chain before its degradation. Here we show that the Cdc48 adaptor Vms1 is a peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase. Similar to classical eukaryotic release factor 1, Vms1 activity is dependent on a conserved catalytic glutamine. Evolutionary analysis indicates that yeast Vms1 is the founding member of a clade of eukaryotic release factor 1 homologues that we designate the Vms1-like release factor 1 clade."

https://openalex.org/W2797717130,"Understanding the functional effects of DNA sequence variants is of critical importance for studies of basic biology, evolution, and medical genetics; however, measuring these effects in a high-throughput manner is a major challenge. One promising avenue is precise editing with the CRISPR–Cas9 system, which allows for generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at genomic sites matching the targeting sequence of a guide RNA (gRNA). Recent studies have used CRISPR libraries to generate many frameshift mutations genome wide through faulty repair of CRISPR-directed breaks by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)1. Here, we developed a CRISPR-library-based approach for highly efficient and precise genome-wide variant engineering. We used our method to examine the functional consequences of premature-termination codons (PTCs) at different locations within all annotated essential genes in yeast. We found that most PTCs were highly deleterious unless they occurred close to the 3′ end of the gene and did not affect an annotated protein domain. Unexpectedly, we discovered that some putatively essential genes are dispensable, whereas others have large dispensable regions. This approach can be used to profile the effects of large classes of variants in a high-throughput manner. The authors present a CRISPR-library-based approach for highly efficient and precise genome-wide variant engineering. They examine the functional consequences of premature termination codons within all annotated essential genes in yeast."

Five anthocyanin monomers in black rice extract were identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and the major anthocyanin monomer (cyanidin-3-glucoside, C3G) was purified by preparative HPLC (Pre-HPLC). The proliferative effects of the anthocyanins on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were investigated by determining the media pH, bacterial populations and metabolic products. After anaerobic incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, not only the pH of the media containing C3G was lower than that of the extract of black rice anthocyanin (BRAE), but the numbers of both Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were also significantly increased. Furthermore, hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, and hydroxybenzoic acids and other metabolites were detected by GC-MS in vitro. Our results revealed that the anthocyanins and anthocyanin monomers from black rice had prebiotic activity and they were metabolized into several small molecules by Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus."
https://openalex.org/W2796525063,"Candida auris is an emerging yeast pathogen of global significance. Its multidrug-resistant nature and inadequacies of conventional identification systems pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This study investigated occurrence of C. auris in clinical specimens in Kuwait and its susceptibility to antifungal agents. Clinical yeast strains isolated during 3.5-year period and forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida were studied by wet mount examination for microscopic morphology and Vitek 2 yeast identification system. A simple species-specific PCR assay was developed for molecular identification and results were confirmed by PCR-sequencing of rDNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing of one isolate from each patient was determined by Etest. The 280 isolates forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida, were identified by Vitek 2 as Candida haemulonii (n = 166), Candida utilis (n = 49), Candida kefyr (n = 45), Candida guilliermondii (n = 9), Candida famata (n = 6) and Candida conglobata (n = 5). Species-specific PCR and PCR-sequencing of rDNA identified 166 C. haemulonii isolates as C. auris (n = 158), C. haemulonii (n = 6) and Candida duobushaemulonii (n = 2). C. auris isolates originated from diverse clinical specimens from 56 patients. Of 56 C. auris isolates tested, all were resistant to fluconazole, 41/56 (73%) and 13/56 (23%) were additionally resistant to voriconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. Eleven (20%) isolates were resistant to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. One isolate was resistant to caspofungin and micafungin. Increasing isolation of C. auris in recent years from diverse clinical specimens including bloodstream shows that C. auris is an emerging non-albicans Candida species in Kuwait causing a variety of infections. Inability of conventional identification methods to accurately identify this pathogen and multidrug-resistant nature of many strains calls for a greater understanding of its epidemiology, risk factors for acquiring C. auris infection and management strategies in high-risk patients. This is the first comprehensive study on the emergence of this multidrug-resistant yeast from Kuwait and the Middle East."

Recent studies indicate that at the very early stage of this disease, increased phosphorylation in Tau’s MDr domain correlates with reduced levels of neuronal excitability. Mechanistically, we show that pyramidal neurons and some parvalbumin-positive interneurons in 1-month-old triple-transgenic AD mice accumulate hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and that this accumulation correlates with changes in theta oscillations in hippocampal neurons. Pyramidal neurons from young triple-transgenic AD mice exhibited less spike accommodation and power increase in subthreshold membrane oscillations. Furthermore, triple-transgenic AD mice challenged with the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine had reduced theta amplitude compared with 4-aminopyridine–treated control mice and, unlike these controls, displayed no seizure-like activity after this challenge. Collectively, our results provide new insights into AD pathogenesis and suggest that increases in Tau phosphorylation at the initial stages of the disease represent neuronal responses that compensate for brain circuit overexcitation.

https://openalex.org/W2797212074,"Visual information is delivered to the brain by >40 types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Diversity in this representation arises within the inner plexiform layer (IPL), where dendrites of each RGC type are restricted to specific sublaminae, limiting the interneuronal types that can innervate them. How such dendritic restriction arises is unclear. We show that the transcription factor Tbr1 is expressed by four mouse RGC types with dendrites in the outer IPL and is required for their laminar specification. Loss of Tbr1 results in elaboration of dendrites within the inner IPL, while misexpression in other cells retargets their neurites to the outer IPL. Two transmembrane molecules, Sorcs3 and Cdh8, act as effectors of the Tbr1-controlled lamination program. However, they are expressed in just one Tbr1+ RGC type, supporting a model in which a single transcription factor implements similar laminar choices in distinct cell types by recruiting partially non-overlapping effectors."

A critical factor determining the biological activities of the sphingolipid, ceramide, and of more complex sphingolipids is their N-acyl chain length, which in mammals is determined by a family of six ceramide synthases (CerS). Little information is available about the CerS regions that determine specificity toward different acyl-CoA substrates. We previously demonstrated that substrate specificity resides in a region of ∼150 residues in the Tram-Lag-CLN8 domain. Using site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analyses, we now narrow specificity down to an 11-residue sequence in a loop located between the last two putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) of the CerS.

Moreover, a chimeric protein, CerS4(291–301→CerS2), based on CerS4 (which normally generates C18–C22 ceramides) displayed significant activity toward C24:1-CoA. Additional data supported the notion that substitutions of these 11 residues alter the specificities of the CerS toward their cognate acyl-CoAs. Our findings may suggest that this short loop may restrict adjacent TMDs, leading to a more open conformation in the membrane, and that the CerS acting on shorter acyl-CoAs may have a longer, more flexible loop, permitting TMD flexibility.

https://openalex.org/W2797640007,"Muscle atrophy (loss of skeletal muscle mass) causes progressive deterioration of skeletal function. Recently, excessive intake of fats was suggested to induce insulin resistance, followed by muscle atrophy. Green tea extracts (GTEs), which contain polyphenols such as epigallocatechin gallate, have beneficial effects on obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, but their effects against muscle atrophy are still unclear. Here, we found that GTEs prevented high-fat (HF) diet-induced muscle weight loss in senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8), a murine model of senescence. SAMP8 mice were fed a control diet, an HF diet, or HF with 0.5% GTEs (HFGT) diet for 4 months. The HF diet induced muscle weight loss with aging (measured as quadriceps muscle weight), whereas GTEs prevented this loss. In HF diet-fed mice, blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations increased in comparison with the control group, and these mice had insulin resistance as determined by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In these mice, serum concentrations of leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), which is known to induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, were elevated, and insulin signaling in muscle, as determined by the phosphorylation levels of Akt and p70 S6 kinases, tended to be decreased. In HFGT diet-fed mice, these signs of insulin resistance and elevation of serum LECT2 were not observed. Although our study did not directly show the effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, insulin resistance examined using HOMA-IR indicated an intervention effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, as revealed by partial correlation analysis. Accordingly, GTEs might have beneficial effects on age-related and HF diet-induced muscle weight loss, which correlates with insulin resistance and is accompanied by a change in serum LECT2."
https://openalex.org/W2798044885,"α-Synuclein (α-Syn)-positive intracytoplasmic inclusions, known as Lewy bodies, are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Although growing evidence suggests that cell-to-cell transmission of α-Syn is associated with the progression of PD and that extracellular α-Syn promotes formation of inclusion bodies, its precise mechanism of action in the extracellular space remains unclear. Here, as indicated by both conventional fractionation techniques and FRET-based protein–protein interaction analysis, we demonstrate that extracellular α-Syn causes expulsion of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 (S1P1R) from the lipid raft fractions. S1P1R regulates vesicular trafficking, and its expulsion involved α-Syn binding to membrane-surface gangliosides. Consequently, the S1P1R became refractory to S1P stimulation required for activating inhibitory G-protein (Gi) in the plasma membranes. Moreover, the extracellular α-Syn also induced uncoupling of the S1P1R on internal vesicles, resulting in the reduced amount of CD63 molecule (CD63) in the lumen of multivesicular endosomes, together with a decrease in CD63 in the released exosomes from α-Syn–treated cells. Furthermore, cholesterol-depleting agent–induced S1P1R expulsion from the rafts also resulted in S1P1R uncoupling. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular α-Syn–induced expulsion of S1P1R from lipid rafts promotes the uncoupling of S1P1R from Gi, thereby blocking subsequent Gi signals, such as inhibition of cargo sorting into exosomal vesicles in multivesicular endosomes. These findings help shed additional light on PD pathogenesis."

Recently, the natural products cyclomarin, ecumicin, and lassomycin have been shown to efficiently kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis persisters.

MtbClpC1 is a member of the class II AAA+ family of proteins, which contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) and two distinct ATP-binding modules, D1 and D2 (Fig. 1a). The active form of ClpC is a homohexamer, and in MtbClpC1 and Synechococcus elongatus ClpC ATP alone is essential and sufficient for efficient protein degradation in association with ClpP (3Andersson F.I.

These phosphorylation sites are often found in secondary structure elements and thus are accessible only when the protein is unfolded or misfolded. This innovative work revealed a new pathway for selective degradation of misfolded proteins in bacteria, but the structural consequences of arginine-phosphate (ArgP) binding to ClpC are unclear. Indeed, although the crystal structure of BsClpC NTD shows two ArgP molecules bound to the protein, no significant structural changes were observed, which is quite surprising because arginine-phosphorylated substrates (e.g. casein) can stimulate BsClpC ATPase activity and promote complex oligomerization (5Trentini D.B.

PZA is a critical first-line TB drug used with isoniazid, ethambutol, and rifampicin for the treatment of TB and is also frequently used to treat multidrug-resistant TB (1Zumla A. Nahid P. Cole S.T.

In addition to PZA, three natural product antibiotics that specifically target MtbClpC1 have been discovered recently: cyclomarin (8Vasudevan D. Rao S.P. Noble C.G.

Cyclomarin, identified and since synthetized by independent groups, is bactericidal against TB and able to kill nonreplicating bacteria (9Schmitt E.K. Riwanto M. Sambandamurthy V. Roggo S. Miault C.

Despite the absence of resistance mutations, ClpC1 NTD was identified as the drug target using affinity chromatography with cyclomarin conjugated to Sepharose (9Schmitt E.K. Riwanto M.

Although the crystal structure of the NTD was identical with or without cyclomarin bound, observations in Mycobacterium smegmatis suggest that cyclomarin can increase proteolysis by the ClpC1P1P2 machine (8Vasudevan D. Rao S.P. Noble C.G. Structural basis of mycobacterial inhibition by cyclomarin A.J. Biol.

Ecumicin is another potent natural antibiotic that efficiently kills Mtb persisters, and resistance mutations in ClpC fall within its NTD (Fig. 1b). When tested in vitro, ecumicin increases ClpC1 ATPase activity severalfold while simultaneously compromising the degradation of ClpC1P1P2 substrates (10Gao W. Kim J.Y. Anderson J.R. Akopian T. Hong S. Jin Y.Y. Kandror O. Kim J.W. Lee I.A. Lee S.Y. McAlpine J.B. Mulugeta S. Sunoqrot S. Wang Y.

Lassomycin, an actinomycetes ribosomally encoded cyclic peptide, is yet another natural antibiotic able to kill Mtb persisters with efficiency (11Gavrish E. Sit C.S. Cao S. Kandror O. Spoering A.

Despite differing structurally from ecumicin, lassomycin also activates ATP hydrolysis by ClpC1 ATPase, and resistant mutants map to a basic domain in the protein's NTD (11Gavrish E. Sit C.S. Cao S.

Because of their high molecular weights and structural complexity, these natural products are challenging for structure–activity relationship studies, but compounds with similar modes of actions may be very attractive as drug candidates. Comprehending the mechanism of action of these compounds will provide valuable insights for the development of more effective TB drugs. Unfortunately, the intrinsic flexibility and exchange dynamics between different oligomeric states of ClpC1 have thus far impeded structural studies. For example, crystallization of BsClpC was only possible upon the removal of flexible loop regions, rendering the protein nonfunctional and, at the same time, underlining the importance of dynamics for the function of these complexes (13Wang F. Mei Z. Qi Y. Yan C. Hu Q. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of the hexameric MecA-ClpC molecular machine.Nature. 2011; 471 (21368759): 331-33510.1038/nature09780Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For this purpose, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) offer important advantages in investigating protein conformation in solution and testing the effects of ligands. Here we have studied the interaction of these potent new antibiotics with ClpC1 by using state-of-the-art NMR and SAXS to elucidate their mode of action. A proper comprehension of the ways these drugs influence ClpC1 mechanism may also clarify how the family of AAA+ ATPases functions upon substrate binding. It is now widely accepted that the conformational heterogeneity of proteins can be an important factor in ligand binding and drug mechanisms of action (14Hart K.M. Ho C.M. Dutta S. Gross M.L. Bowman G.R. Modelling proteins' hidden conformations to predict antibiotic resistance.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27708258): 1296510.1038/ncomms12965Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the case of cyclomarin, no significant changes in the ClpC1 NTD X-ray structure were observed upon ligand binding. Therefore, it was proposed that hidden unexplored conformations could be the basis for the compound's specific actions (8Vasudevan D. Rao S.P. Noble C.G. Structural basis of mycobacterial inhibition by cyclomarin A.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 (24022489): 30883-3089110.1074/jbc.M113.493767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although the linking of conformational heterogeneity or dynamics to protein function is a difficult task, NMR is a powerful method for elucidating such phenomena. Full-length MtbClpC1 contains 849 residues that form a functional hexamer of 561 kDa in the presence of ATP. The large size of this complex, together with its low solubility and expression, prohibits NMR studies of the full-length protein even when perdeuterated and specifically methyl-labeled samples are used. To circumvent this problem, we cloned and expressed separately the MtbClpC1 domains NTD (1–145 aa), D1 (165–493 aa), D2 (494–849 aa), NTD-D1 (1–493 aa), and D1-D2 (165–849 aa). With the exception of the NTD, NTD-D1, and D2 constructs, all of the others yielded insoluble proteins when expressed. Moreover, the D2 domain when purified did not show any detectable ATPase activity and did not form oligomers in the presence of ATP, whereas the NTD-D1 construct was soluble when expressed in ArticExpress cells at 4 °C but precipitated when ATP was added. Mutations in the NTD of MtbClpC1 have been shown to confer resistance to cyclomarin, ecumicin, lassomycin, and PZA, indicating a pivotal role for this domain (Fig. 1b). This 16-kDa domain is easily accessible for solution-state NMR even without perdeuteration. Therefore, we focused our work on MtbClpC1 NTD and tested the effects of the different antibiotics on its structure in solution. MtbClpC1 NTD behaved as a homogeneous monomeric protein upon size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. S1a) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Fig. S1a), resulting in high-quality NMR spectra with excellent peak dispersion, indication of a well-folded, globular protein (Fig. 2a). Two sets of assignment experiments were done. At pH 7.5, we were unable to assign loop regions because of amide exchange, but at pH 6.0 we were able to assign 95% of all residues, allowing the mapping of almost the entire protein structure. ClpC1 NTD consists of eight helices that fold as two repeats of a four-helix motif sharing 58% identity (Fig. 2b). A 14–amino acid loop between helices 4 and 5 connects the two motifs (8Vasudevan D. Rao S.P. Noble C.G. Structural basis of mycobacterial inhibition by cyclomarin A.J. Biol.

Analysis of the backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts with TALOS+ (15Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+: A hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44 (19548092): 213-22310.1007/s10858-009-9333-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar) showed that the predicted secondary structure elements in the NTD in solution are highly similar to the elements in the crystal structure (Fig. 2b). We proceeded by testing the effect of cyclomarin binding on MtbClpC1 NTD spectra. When cyclomarin was added to the MtbClpC1 NTD, substantial changes in the spectrum were observed (Fig. 2a). Similar changes were observed with the analogue desoxycyclomarin (Fig. S1b) (16Barbie P. Kazmaier U. Total synthesis of desoxycyclomarin C and the cyclomarazines A and B.Org. Biomol. Chem. 2016; 14 (27241664): 6055-606410.1039/C6OB00801ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, given the amplitude of chemical shift perturbations (CSP), a new set of assignment experiments was required to identify the shifted residues. The large magnitude of the CSP (Fig. 2c) observed is likely a consequence of the rich content of aromatic residues in the cyclomarin molecule and the corresponding ring-current effect. As the chemical shift is very sensitive to a change in the local chemical environment, we were able to map the compound binding site to the region between helices 1 and 5 (Fig. 2d) in agreement with the X-ray structure of this domain in the presence of bound cyclomarin (8Vasudevan D. Rao S.P. Noble C.G. Structural basis of mycobacterial inhibition by cyclomarin A.J. Biol.

Analysis of the chemical shifts in backbone amides CO, Cα, and Cβ with TALOS+ (15Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A.

Based on the location of the resistance mutations (Fig. 1b), ecumicin was proposed to target the MtbClpC1 NTD as well (10Gao W. Kim J.Y. Anderson J.R. Akopian T. Hong S. Jin Y.Y. Kandror O. Kim J.W. Lee I.A. Lee S.Y. McAlpine J.B. Mulugeta S. Sunoqrot S. Wang Y. Yang S.H. et al.The cyclic peptide ecumicin targeting ClpC1 is active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vivo.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2015; 59 (25421483): 880-88910.1128/AAC.04054-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For this reason, we tested whether we could observe similar effects for ecumicin as we had for cyclomarin using NMR. Compared with cyclomarin, ecumicin caused only modest spectral changes (Fig. S2). These small perturbations did not indicate a strong binding of ecumicin to the MtbClpC1 NTD and were inconsistent with previous biochemical data, where ecumicin was found to be a potent inhibitor of MtbClpC1 degradation of casein but a stimulator of MtbClpC1 ATPase activity (result confirmed here (Fig. S2d)) (10Gao W. Kim J.Y. Anderson J.R. Akopian T. Hong S. Jin Y.Y. Kandror O. Kim J.W. Lee I.A. Lee S.Y. McAlpine J.B. Mulugeta S. Sunoqrot S. Wang Y. Yang S.H. et al.The cyclic peptide ecumicin targeting ClpC1 is active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vivo.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2015; 59 (25421483): 880-88910.1128/AAC.04054-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consequently, we tested ecumicin binding to the NTD using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Although we were able to confirm the nanomolar Kd for cyclomarin (8Vasudevan D. Rao S.P. Noble C.G. Structural basis of mycobacterial inhibition by cyclomarin A.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 (24022489): 30883-3089110.1074/jbc.M113.493767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. S3), we were unable to obtain a saturation curve with ecumicin under the conditions used (up to 100 μm ecumicin (Fig. S3)). In contrast to cyclomarin and ecumicin, the addition of PZA did not result in any changes in the NTD NMR spectra, and furthermore, no binding of PZA was observed by ITC (Fig. S3). Analysis of the 15N backbone relaxation rates can provide detailed information about protein dynamics on different time scales. In particular, motions in the μs–ms time scale, associated with conformational changes between different states, often occur in sites that are important for protein function (17Kleckner I.R. Foster M.P. An introduction to NMR-based approaches for measuring protein dynamics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1814 (21059410): 942-96810.1016/j.bbapap.2010.10.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 18Eisenmesser E.Z. Millet O. Labeikovsky W. Korzhnev D.M. Wolf-Watz M. Bosco D.A. Skalicky J.J. Kay L.E. Kern D. Intrinsic dynamics of an enzyme underlies catalysis.Nature. 2005; 438 (16267559): 117-12110.1038/nature04105Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Studying the dynamics of MtbClpC1 NTD was particularly interesting because it acts as a ligand recognition site that has to transmit information about the bound state to the D1 and D2 rings for ATP-driven translocation and unfolding. Given the very modest structural differences of the NTD in its apo- and cyclomarin-bound states, we reasoned that dynamics may be important in the allosteric process. To investigate whether such μs–ms motions are indeed relevant for the NTD, we performed Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation–dispersion (RD) NMR experiments. Briefly, RD profiles monitor the effective spin relaxation rate constant (R2,eff) as a function of a variable repetition rate, νCPMG, of refocusing pulses applied during a relaxation delay. The presence of conformational dynamics is manifest as a dependence of R2,eff on νCPMG, i.e. “nonflat” RD profiles. Such dispersions arise when the local environment around the atom under consideration fluctuates on a μs–ms time scale, either because of the motion of the considered atom(s) or of neighboring atoms, e.g. through binding events. When we applied this technique to apoNTD, we observed flat RD curves for all backbone amides. Thus, this domain alone does not exhibit significant μs–ms motions. Furthermore, cyclomarin binding did not induce ms dynamics in the NTD. In B. subtilis, phosphorylation of arginines targets certain proteins for ClpCP-mediated degradation (5Trentini D.B. Suskiewicz M.J. Heuck A. Kurzbauer R. Deszcz L. Mechtler K. Clausen T. Arginine phosphorylation marks proteins for degradation by a Clp protease.Nature. 2016; 10.1038/nature20122Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated proteins are first detected and bound by the NTD of ClpC and then transferred to the D1 domain for subsequent unfolding and degradation (5Trentini D.B. Suskiewicz M.J. Heuck A. Kurzbauer R. Deszcz L. Mechtler K. Clausen T. Arginine phosphorylation marks proteins for degradation by a Clp protease.Nature. 2016; 10.1038/nature20122Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Analyzing the MtbClpC1 NTD sequence, we found that the binding site of ArgP in B. subtilis is strictly conserved in Mtb (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, comparing the overall structures of the two NTDs, it is clear that they are structurally identical, with a root mean square deviation of 1.7 Å (Fig. S3b). This striking similarity motivated us to test whether MtbClpC1 NTD could also bind ArgP. Indeed, using ITC we confirmed that NTD bound ArgP with a Kd of 5.2 μm (Fig. 3b), a value similar to that reported for BsClpC NTD (5Trentini D.B. Suskiewicz M.J. Heuck A. Kurzbauer R. Deszcz L. Mechtler K. Clausen T. Arginine phosphorylation marks proteins for degradation by a Clp protease.Nature. 2016; 10.1038/nature20122Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition, a pulldown showed that McsB-phosphorylated lysozyme and casein bind to ClpC1 NTD, whereas no binding was observed with the control substrate (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, as reported previously for BsClpC, a large excess of free ArgP was required to inhibit this association, likely reflecting a stronger binding of NTD to the protein substrate (Fig. 3c). Despite some residual binding of nonphosphorylated lysozyme, a similar result was observed when full-length ClpC1 was used instead of isolated NTD (Fig. S3c). The addition of ArgP to MtbClpC1 NTD resulted in strong perturbations of its backbone amide NMR spectrum (Fig. 3d). This effect was specific to ArgP because no significant changes were observed with unmodified arginine or phosphoserine (Fig. S4). In contrast to the rather small changes in peak intensity observed upon cyclomarin or ecumicin addition, ArgP caused significant changes in peak intensity, with 45% of the peaks falling below the level of detection into the background noise (Fig. 3e). As shown below, this decrease in intensity may indicate exchange events at the affected residues. Interestingly, these residues do not map exclusively to the putative binding site of ArgP but are localized over a large part of the core of the structure, whereby helices 2, 3, 6, and 7 are most affected (Fig. 3, e and f). Using CPMG RD experiments, we were able to prove that the observed decrease in intensity is indeed caused by millisecond dynamics (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, these dynamics can be seen throughout the domain. In Fig. 4a the affected residues and the ΔR2,eff are plotted on the structure of MtbClpC1 NTD. Furthermore, we assumed that the part of the protein showing the highest degree of motion were the three helices with disappearing resonances (refer to Fig. 3f). Although CPMG RD experiments provide residue-resolved direct evidence of the existence of dynamics, they do not actually reveal what the underlying motion corresponds to. In the case of low-affinity binding, ms dynamics also can be caused by the on/off binding dynamics of the compound. Considering the ArgP Kd, we could calculate the population of free NTD with the concentrations of ArgP used (2 mm), resulting in full-domain saturation (calculated free NTD, 0.3%). Fitting of the CPMG RD data with the software Chemex provided an exchange rate between the ground and excited states, the population of the excited state, and the chemical shift diff"

However, the mechanism of its biogenesis remains controversial. CD38 is the only enzyme known to catalyze NAADP synthesis from NADP and nicotinic acid. CD38-mediated catalysis requires an acidic pH, suggesting that NAADP may be produced in acidic endolysosomes, but this hypothesis is untested. In this study, using human cell lines, we specifically directed CD38 to the endolysosomal system and assessed cellular NAADP production. First, we found that nanobodies targeting various epitopes on the C-terminal domain of CD38 could bind to cell surface–localized CD38 and induce its endocytosis. We also found that CD38 internalization occurred via a clathrin-dependent pathway, delivered CD38 to the endolysosome, and elevated intracellular NAADP levels. We also created a CD38 variant for lysosome-specific expression, which not only withstood the degradative environment in the lysosome, but was also much more active than WT CD38 in elevating cellular NAADP levels. Supplementing CD38-expressing cells with nicotinic acid substantially increased cellular NAADP levels. These results demonstrate that endolysosomal CD38 can produce NAADP in human cells.

https://openalex.org/W2796776203,"The uncharacterized protein family 0016 (UPF0016) is a family of secondary ion transporters implicated in calcium homeostasis and some diseases. More precisely, genetic variants of the human UPF0016 ortholog transmembrane protein 165 (TMEM165) have been linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog Gdt1p has been shown to be involved in calcium homeostasis and protein glycosylation. Moreover, plant and bacterial UPF0016 members appear to have putative roles in Mn2+ homeostasis. Here, we produced the yeast UPF0016 member Gdt1p in the bacterial host Lactococcus lactis. Using Mn2+-induced quenching of Fura-2–emitted fluorescence, we observed that Gdt1p mediates Mn2+ influx, in addition to its previously reported regulation of Ca2+ influx. The estimated Km values of Gdt1p of 15.6 ± 2.6 μm for Ca2+ and 83.2 ± 9.8 μm for Mn2+ indicated that Gdt1p has a higher affinity for Ca2+ than for Mn2+. In yeast cells, we found that Gdt1p is involved in the resistance to high Mn2+ concentration and controls total Mn2+ stores. Lastly, we demonstrated that GDT1 deletion affects the activity of the yeast Mn2+-dependent Sod2p superoxide dismutase, most likely by modulating cytosolic Mn2+ concentrations. Taken together, we obtained first evidence that Gdt1p from yeast directly transports manganese, which strongly reinforces the suggested link between the UPF0016 family and Mn2+ homeostasis and provides new insights into the molecular causes of human TMEM165-associated CDGs. Our results also shed light on how yeast cells may regulate Golgi intraluminal concentrations of manganese, a key cofactor of many enzymes involved in protein glycosylation. The uncharacterized protein family 0016 (UPF0016) is a family of secondary ion transporters implicated in calcium homeostasis and some diseases. More precisely, genetic variants of the human UPF0016 ortholog transmembrane protein 165 (TMEM165) have been linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog Gdt1p has been shown to be involved in calcium homeostasis and protein glycosylation. Moreover, plant and bacterial UPF0016 members appear to have putative roles in Mn2+ homeostasis. Here, we produced the yeast UPF0016 member Gdt1p in the bacterial host Lactococcus lactis. Using Mn2+-induced quenching of Fura-2–emitted fluorescence, we observed that Gdt1p mediates Mn2+ influx, in addition to its previously reported regulation of Ca2+ influx. The estimated Km values of Gdt1p of 15.6 ± 2.6 μm for Ca2+ and 83.2 ± 9.8 μm for Mn2+ indicated that Gdt1p has a higher affinity for Ca2+ than for Mn2+. In yeast cells, we found that Gdt1p is involved in the resistance to high Mn2+ concentration and controls total Mn2+ stores. Lastly, we demonstrated that GDT1 deletion affects the activity of the yeast Mn2+-dependent Sod2p superoxide dismutase, most likely by modulating cytosolic Mn2+ concentrations. Taken together, we obtained first evidence that Gdt1p from yeast directly transports manganese, which strongly reinforces the suggested link between the UPF0016 family and Mn2+ homeostasis and provides new insights into the molecular causes of human TMEM165-associated CDGs. Our results also shed light on how yeast cells may regulate Golgi intraluminal concentrations of manganese, a key cofactor of many enzymes involved in protein glycosylation."

https://openalex.org/W2797574258,"Background Pain levels in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee are commonly assessed by using a numeric scoring system, but results may be influenced by factors other than the patient’s actual physical discomfort or disease severity, including psychosocial and demographic variables. We examined the possible relation between knee-pain scores and several psychosocial, sociodemographic, disease, and treatment variables in 355 patients with knee OA. Methods The pain-evaluation instrument was a 0- to 10-point rating scale. Data obtained retrospectively from the patients’ medical records were demographic characteristics, body mass index (BMI), concomitant disorders, illicit and prescription drug use, alcohol use, smoking, knee OA treatment, and severity of knee OA indicated by Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) radiographic grade. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine whether these variables correlated with reported pain scores. Results On univariate analysis, higher pain scores were significantly associated with Native American or Hispanic ethnicity; a higher BMI; current prescription for an opioid, antidepressant, or gabapentinoid medication; depression; diabetes mellitus; fibromyalgia; illicit drug use; lack of health insurance; smoking; previous knee injection; and recommendation by the clinician that the patient undergo knee surgery. Neither the patient’s sex nor the KL grade showed a correlation. On multivariate analysis, depression, current opioid prescription, and Native American or Hispanic ethnicity retained a significant association with higher pain scores. Conclusions and implications Our results in a large, ethnically diverse group of patients with knee OA suggest that psychosocial and sociodemographic factors may be important determinants of pain levels reported by patients with knee OA."
https://openalex.org/W2796855833,"The conserved serine/threonine protein kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) is a major regulator of eukaryotic cellular and organismal growth and a valuable target for drug therapy. TOR forms the core of two evolutionary conserved complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, TORC2 responds to glucose levels and, by activating the protein kinase Gad8 (an orthologue of human AKT), is required for well-regulated cell cycle progression, starvation responses, and cell survival. Here, we report that TORC2–Gad8 is also required for gene silencing and the formation of heterochromatin at the S. pombe mating-type locus and at subtelomeric regions. Deletion of TORC2–Gad8 resulted in loss of the heterochromatic modification of histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and an increase in euchromatic modifications, including histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone 4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16Ac). Accumulation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at subtelomeric genes in TORC2–Gad8 mutant cells indicated a defect in silencing at the transcriptional level. Moreover, a concurrent decrease in histone 4 lysine 20 dimethylation (H4K20me2) suggested elevated histone turnover. Loss of gene silencing in cells lacking TORC2–Gad8 is partially suppressed by loss of the anti-silencer Epe1 and fully suppressed by loss of the Pol II–associated Paf1 complex, two chromatin regulators that have been implicated in heterochromatin stability and spreading. Taken together, our findings suggest that TORC2–Gad8 signaling contributes to epigenetic stability at subtelomeric regions and the mating-type locus in S. pombe."
https://openalex.org/W2797298727,"Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of class IIa histone deacetylases (i.e. HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9) is a synaptic activity- and nuclear calcium–dependent mechanism important for epigenetic regulation of signal-regulated gene expression in hippocampal neurons. HDAC4 in particular has been linked to the regulation of genes important for both synaptic structure and plasticity. Here, using a constitutively nuclear-localized, dominant-active variant of HDAC4 (HDAC4 3SA), we demonstrate that HDAC4 accumulation in the nucleus severely reduces both the length and complexity of dendrites of cultured mature hippocampal neurons, but does not affect the number of dendritic spines. This phenomenon appeared to be specific to HDAC4, as increasing the expression of HDAC3 or HDAC11, belonging to class I and class IV HDACs, respectively, did not alter dendritic architecture. We also show that HDAC4 3SA decreases the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGFD), a key protein required for the maintenance of dendritic arbors. The expression of other members of the VEGF family and their receptors was not affected by the nuclear accumulation of HDAC4. VEGFD overexpression or administration of recombinant VEGFD, but not VEGFC, the closest VEGFD homologue, rescued the impaired dendritic architecture caused by the nuclear-localized HDAC4 variant. These results identify HDAC4 as an epigenetic regulator of neuronal morphology that controls dendritic arborization via the expression of VEGFD."
https://openalex.org/W2797448967,"Aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO) is an essential enzyme for production of long-chain alkanes as drop-in biofuels, which are compatible with existing fuel systems. The most active ADOs are present in mesophilic cyanobacteria, especially Nostoc punctiforme Given the potential applications of thermostable enzymes in biorefineries, here we generated a thermostable (Cts)-ADO based on a consensus of ADO sequences from several thermophilic cyanobacterial strains. Using an in silico design pipeline and a metagenome library containing 41 hot-spring microbial communities, we created Cts-ADO. Cts-ADO displayed a 3.8-fold increase in pentadecane production on raising the temperature from 30 to 42 °C, whereas ADO from N. punctiforme (Np-ADO) exhibited a 1.7-fold decline. 3D structure modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of Cts- and Np-ADO at different temperatures revealed differences between the two enzymes in residues clustered on exposed loops of these variants, which affected the conformation of helices involved in forming the ADO catalytic core. In Cts-ADO, this conformational change promoted ligand binding to its preferred iron, Fe2, in the di-iron cluster at higher temperature, but the reverse was observed in Np-ADO. Detailed mapping of residues conferring Cts-ADO thermostability identified four amino acids, which we substituted individually and together in Np-ADO. Among these substitution variants, A161E was remarkably similar to Cts-ADO in terms of activity optima, kinetic parameters, and structure at higher temperature. A161E was located in loop L6, which connects helices H5 and H6, and supported ligand binding to Fe2 at higher temperatures, thereby promoting optimal activity at these temperatures and explaining the increased thermostability of Cts-ADO."
https://openalex.org/W2951488903,"The Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirotris) is a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirus-induced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three G-tetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all TmPVs, G4 sequences were located in the non-coding region near putative E2 binding sites. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are possible regulatory elements in TmPVs."
https://openalex.org/W2796519766,"Background During the last decade, an increasing popularity of marathons has been seen. Although running has been shown to have considerable positive health effects, the risk of sudden death, most often due to sudden cardiac arrests, is also a risk runners expose themselves to. Whilst there are some studies on the mortality amongst long-distance runners, much of the evidence is dated. Given the increased popularity in running during the 21st century as well as the improvements in medical care at marathons, more knowledge is required on the mortality risk. Materials and method Publicly available racing and news databases were used to identify the number of entrants and finishers in half to full marathons in Sweden between 2007 and 2016 and the number of deaths that occurred in conjunction with the races. Results A total of 1,156,271 runners entered a long distance (21-42km) running race in Sweden between 2007 and 2016, and 834,412 runners finished the races (72.2%). A large majority of the finishers (677,050 (81%)) competed in distances under a full marathon. Two deaths occurred during the time period, meaning that the death rate was 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.04–0.79) per 100,000 finishers. Conclusions This study can show that death rates in long distance running races between 2007 and 2016 in Sweden are very low, compared to previous studies. When added to the existing literature, the combined picture suggests a general downward trend in the risk of death during marathons since the 1980s."
https://openalex.org/W2797184287,"Objectives The aim was to examine the association between serum vitamin D concentration and isometric strength of various muscle groups, vertical jump performance, and repeated sprint ability in young ice hockey players. The secondary aim was to determine the association between vitamin D deficiency and indices of iron status. Methods Fifty male ice hockey players (17.2±0.9 years) participated in this cross-sectional study. Exercise performance was evaluated using isometric strength measures of upper and lower extremities, vertical jump performance and repeated sprint ability (RSA). Blood samples were collected for the determination of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and multiple indicies of iron status. Results The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 30.4 ng·ml-1 and ranged from 12.5 to 91.4 ng·ml-1. Eleven participants (22%) had vitamin D deficiency and 20 athletes (40%) had vitamin D insufficiency. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was not positively correlated with isometric muscle strength, vertical jump performance, or RSA after adjusting for age, training experience, fat mass, fat free mass and height. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was not associated with indices of iron status. Conclusion Vitamin D insufficiency is highly prevalent in ice hockey players, but 25(OH)D concentration but it is not associated with exercise performance or indices of iron status."
https://openalex.org/W2796561124,"The foraging ecology of pelagic seabirds is difficult to characterize because of their large foraging areas. In the face of this difficulty, DNA metabarcoding may be a useful approach to analyze diet compositions and foraging behaviors. Using this approach, we investigated the diet composition and its seasonal variation of a common seabird species on the Ogasawara Islands, Japan: the wedge-tailed shearwater Ardenna pacifica. We collected fecal samples during the prebreeding (N = 73) and rearing (N = 96) periods. The diet composition of wedge-tailed shearwater was analyzed by Ion Torrent sequencing using two universal polymerase chain reaction primers for the 12S and 16S mitochondrial DNA regions that targeted vertebrates and mollusks, respectively. The results of a BLAST search of obtained sequences detected 31 and 1 vertebrate and mollusk taxa, respectively. The results of the diet composition analysis showed that wedge-tailed shearwaters frequently consumed deep-sea fishes throughout the sampling season, indicating the importance of these fishes as a stable food resource. However, there was a marked seasonal shift in diet, which may reflect seasonal changes in food resource availability and wedge-tailed shearwater foraging behavior. The collected data regarding the shearwater diet may be useful for in situ conservation efforts. Future research that combines DNA metabarcoding with other tools, such as data logging, may provide further insight into the foraging ecology of pelagic seabirds."
https://openalex.org/W2796695648,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a major transducer of estrogen-mediated physiological signals. ERα is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which encompasses ligand-dependent transcription factors. The C terminus of nuclear receptors, termed the F domain, is the least homologous region among the members of this family. The ERα F domain possesses 45 amino acids; however, its function remains unclear. We noticed that the homology of the F domains between mouse and human ERαs is remarkably lower (75.6% similarity) than that between the entire proteins (94.7% similarity). To assess the functionality of the ERα F domains, here we generated chimeric ERα expression constructs with mouse-human–exchanged F domains. Using cell-based in vitro assays, we analyzed the transcriptional coactivator interaction and ligand-binding domain dimerization activities of these mouse–human F domain–swapped ERαs. We found that the transcriptional activity of the mouse WT ERα is more potent than that of the human WT ERα in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT)-mediated transcriptional activity of mouse–human F domain–swapped ERαs was the inverse of the WT ERα activities but not estradiol-mediated transcriptional activities. Further experiments with constructs containing deletion or point mutations of a predicted β-strand region within the F domain suggested that this region governs the species-specific 4OHT-mediated transcriptional activity of ERα. We conclude that the ERα F domain has a species-specific function in 4OHT-mediated receptor transactivation and that mouse–human F domain–swapped ERα mutants enable key insights into ERα F domain structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2798001025,"We applied an in vitro selection approach using two different plant lectins that bind to α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialic acids to determine which genetic changes of the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus alter hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding toward α2,3- or α2,6-linked glycans. Consecutive passages of the A/California/04/09 virus with or without lectins in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells led to development of three HA1 amino acid substitutions, N129D, G155E, and S183P, and one mutation in the neuraminidase (NA), G201E. The S183P mutation significantly increased binding to several α2,6 SA-linked glycans, including YDS, 6'SL(N), and 6-Su-6'SLN, compared to the wild-type virus (↑3.6-fold, P < 0.05). Two other HA1 mutations, N129D and G155E, were sufficient to significantly increase binding to α2,6-linked glycans, 6'SLN and 6-Su-6'SLN, compared to S183P (↑4.1-fold, P < 0.05). These HA1 mutations also increased binding affinity for 3'SLN glycan compared to the wild-type virus as measured by Biacore surface plasmon resonance method. In addition, the HA1 N129D and HA1 G155E substitutions were identified as antigenic mutations. Furthermore, the G201E mutation in NA reduced the NA enzyme activity (↓2.3-fold). These findings demonstrate that the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus can acquire enhanced receptor affinity for both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic receptors under lectin-induced selective pressure. Such changes in binding affinity are conferred by selection of beneficial HA1 mutations that affect receptor specificity, antigenicity, and/or functional compatibility with the NA protein."
https://openalex.org/W2797616263,"To determine the effect of mechanical stretching load and the efficacy of postmenopausal estrogen therapy (ET) on pelvic organ prolapse (POP), vaginal fibroblasts isolated from postmenopausal women with or without POP were subjected to 0.1-Hz uniaxial cyclic mechanical stretching (CS) with 10% elongation and 10−8 M 17-β-estradiol (E2) treatment. We investigated the morphological characteristics of extracellular polymers using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and monitored the mRNA expression of type I collagen (COL I) and type III collagen (COL III) as well as the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family members decorin (DCN), biglycan (BGN), fibromodulin (FMO), and lumican (LUM), using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using SEM, certain viscoelastic polymers were found to be randomly distributed among fibroblasts, which for normal fibroblasts formed clusters of plum flower-like patterns under static-culture conditions and resembled stretched strips when stretched in culture, whereas polymers among POP fibroblasts resembled stretched strips under static-cultured conditions and presented broken networks when stretched in culture. RT-PCR revealed that COL I, DCN, BGN, FMO, and LUM mRNA expression was significantly higher in POP than in normal fibroblasts under static-culture condition. Following CS, COL I and BGN mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in normal fibroblasts, and DCN and FMO mRNA expression was down-regulated in POP fibroblasts. Following concomitant CS and E2 treatment, significantly elevated COL I and DCN mRNA expression was observed in normal fibroblasts, and significantly elevated COL I and BGN mRNA expression was observed in POP fibroblasts. COL III mRNA expression was not significantly different between the POP and normal group, and CS did not significantly affect expression in either group, though COL III was down-regulated in normal fibroblasts concomitantly treated with E2 and CS. We conclude that the morphological distribution of extracellular polymers in POP fibroblasts exhibited higher sensitivity and lower tolerance to stretching loads than do normal fibroblasts. These mechanical properties were further reflected in the transcription of COL I. Defects in the compensatory function of BGN for DCN and LUM for FMO exist in POP fibroblasts, which further affect the structure and function of COL I in response to stretching load, ultimately resulting in abnormal reconstruction of pelvic supportive connective tissues and the occurrence of POP. ET can maintain stretching-induced elevations in COL I and DCN transcription in healthy women and improve stretching-induced COL I, DCN, BGN, and FMO transcriptional changes in POP women to prevent and improve POP. Only down-regulated COL III transcription was observed upon concomitant CS and E2 treatment in normal fibroblasts, which suggests that the tensile strength, not the elasticity, of the supportive connective tissues is damaged in POP and that the higher tensile strength induced by ET in healthy fibroblasts prevents POP. These findings confirm the role of higher sensitivity and lower tolerance to mechanical stretching in the pathogenesis of POP and further provide evidence supporting the use of ET to prevent and inhibit POP in postmenopausal women."
https://openalex.org/W2798104393,"Background During the last decade, the incidence and mortality rates of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been steadily increasing in young women but not in men. Environmental variables that contribute to cardiovascular events in women remain ill-defined. Methods and results A total of 2199 consecutive patients presenting with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 25.8% women, mean age 62.6±12.4 years) were admitted at the Montreal Heart Institute between June 2010 and December 2014. Snow fall exceeding 2cm/day was identified as a positive predictor for STEMI admission rates in the overall population (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07–1.48, p = 0.005), with a significant effect being seen in men (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06–1.53, p = 0.01) but not in women (p = NS). An age-specific analysis revealed a significant increase in hospital admission rates for STEMI in younger women ≤55 years, (n = 104) during days with higher outside temperature (p = 0.004 vs men ≤55 years) and longer daylight hours (p = 0.0009 vs men ≤55 years). Accordingly, summer season, increased outside temperature and sunshine hours were identified as strong positive predictors for STEMI occurrence in women ≤55 years (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.1–2.5, p = 0.012, RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.007, and RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.011, respectively), while an opposite trend was observed in men ≤55 years (RR for outside temperature 0.8, 95% CI 0.73–0.95, p = 0.01). Conclusion The impact of environmental variables on STEMI is age- and sex-dependent. Higher temperature may play an important role in triggering such acute events in young women."
https://openalex.org/W2797681273,"Background Echocardiography is the most valuable tool for assessing cardiac abnormalities of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients even though it has its limitations, including high equipment cost and the need for specialized personnel. Assessment of volume status is important not only for volume management, but also for prevention of cardiovascular disease of the CKD patients. Recently, bioimpedance is gaining acceptance as a way to quantitatively assess patient hydration status at bedside. Methods 127 patients who were admitted for planning their first dialysis treatment were enrolled. The echocardiography and bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) were performed. The association between echocardiographic data and clinical values such as NT-proBNP and OH/ECW was examined. Results OH/ECW, which indicates relative fluid overload, was positively associated with LA dimension (r = 0.25, P = 0.007), LAVI (r = 0.32, P < 0.001), and E/e´ ratio (r = 0.38, P < 0.001). While OH/ECW was not significantly associated with echocardiographic values such as LVEDD, LVEDV, LVMI, and LVEF, NT-proBNP were significantly associated with all echocardiographic parameters. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed E/e´ ratio (odds ratio, 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01 to 1.29]; P = 0.031), NT-proBNP (odds ratio, 4.78 [95% CI, 1.51 to 15.11]; P = 0.008), and albumin (odds ratio, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.66]; P = 0.007) were significantly associated with OH/ECW. Conclusions Since OH/ECW measured by BIS is associated with echocardiographic parameters related to diastolic dysfunction, preliminary screening through laboratory findings, including serum albumin in conjunction with OH/ECW and NT-proBNP, may find patient with risk of diastolic dysfunction. Our study suggests that a timely detection of fluid overload in patients with CKD as well as their proper treatment may help reduce diastolic dysfunction. Further research may be needed to validate the consistency of this association across other stages of CKD."

We determined the apo form crystal structure of a member of the OYE class, glycerol trinitrate reductase XdpB, from Agrobacterium bohemicum R89-1 at 2.1 Å resolution. In agreement with the structures of the related bacterial OYEs, the structure revealed the TIM barrel fold with an N-terminal β-hairpin lid, but surprisingly, the structure did not contain its cofactor FMN. Its putative binding site was occupied by a pentapeptide TTSDN from the C-terminus of a symmetry related molecule. Biochemical experiments confirmed a specific concentration-dependent oligomerization and a low FMN content. The blocking of the FMN binding site can exist in vivo and regulates enzyme activity. Our bioinformatic analysis indicated that a similar self-inhibition could be expected in more OYEs which we designated as subgroup OYE C1. This subgroup is widespread among G-bacteria and can be recognized by the conserved sequence GxxDYP in proximity of the C termini. In proteobacteria, the C1 subgroup OYEs are typically coded in one operon with short-chain dehydrogenase. This operon is controlled by the tetR-like transcriptional regulator. OYEs coded in these operons are unlikely to be involved in the oxidative stress response as the other known members of the OYE family because no upregulation of XdpB was observed after exposing A. bohemicum R89-1 to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2796663500,"The modulatory role of the primary motor cortex (M1), reflected by an inhibitory effect of M1-stimulation on clinical pain, motivated us to deepen our understanding of M1’s role in pain modulation. We used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)-induced virtual lesion (VL) to interrupt with M1 activity during noxious heat pain. We hypothesized that TMS-VL will effect experimental pain ratings. Three VL protocols were applied consisting of single-pulse TMS to transiently interfere with right M1 activity: (1) VLM1- TMS applied to 11 subjects, 20 msec before the individual’s first pain-related M1 peak activation, as determined by source analysis (sLORETA), (2) VL-50 (N = 16; TMS applied 50 ms prior to noxious stimulus onset), and (3) VL+150 (N = 16; TMS applied 150 ms after noxious stimulus onset). Each protocol included 3 conditions ('pain-alone', ' TMS-VL', and ‘SHAM-VL’), each consisted of 30 noxious heat stimuli. Pain ratings were compared, in each protocol, for TMS-VL vs. SHAM-VL and vs. pain-alone conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance, corrected for multiple comparisons revealed no significant differences in the pain ratings between the different conditions within each protocol. Therefore, our results from this exploratory study suggest that a single pulse TMS-induced VL that is targeted to M1 failed to interrupt experimental pain processing in the specific three stimulation timing examined here."
