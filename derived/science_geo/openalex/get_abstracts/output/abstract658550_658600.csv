https://openalex.org/W3081090897,"Temperature controls plant growth and development, and climate change has already altered the phenology of wild plants and crops1. However, the mechanisms by which plants sense temperature are not well understood. The evening complex is a major signalling hub and a core component of the plant circadian clock2,3. The evening complex acts as a temperature-responsive transcriptional repressor, providing rhythmicity and temperature responsiveness to growth through unknown mechanisms2,4–6. The evening complex consists of EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3)4,7, a large scaffold protein and key component of temperature sensing; ELF4, a small α-helical protein; and LUX ARRYTHMO (LUX), a DNA-binding protein required to recruit the evening complex to transcriptional targets. ELF3 contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat8–10, embedded within a predicted prion domain (PrD). Here we find that the length of the polyQ repeat correlates with thermal responsiveness. We show that ELF3 proteins in plants from hotter climates, with no detectable PrD, are active at high temperatures, and lack thermal responsiveness. The temperature sensitivity of ELF3 is also modulated by the levels of ELF4, indicating that ELF4 can stabilize the function of ELF3. In both Arabidopsis and a heterologous system, ELF3 fused with green fluorescent protein forms speckles within minutes in response to higher temperatures, in a PrD-dependent manner. A purified fragment encompassing the ELF3 PrD reversibly forms liquid droplets in response to increasing temperatures in vitro, indicating that these properties reflect a direct biophysical response conferred by the PrD. The ability of temperature to rapidly shift ELF3 between active and inactive states via phase transition represents a previously unknown thermosensory mechanism. The adaptability of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana to different temperatures is regulated by the ability of its ELF3 protein to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation, in a manner that is dependent on the protein’s prion-like domain."

Inducing such an ability to spontaneously maintain undetectable plasma viraemia is a major objective of HIV-1 cure research, but the characteristics of proviral reservoirs in elite controllers remain to be determined. Here, using next-generation sequencing of near-full-length single HIV-1 genomes and corresponding chromosomal integration sites, we show that the proviral reservoirs of elite controllers frequently consist of oligoclonal to near-monoclonal clusters of intact proviral sequences. In contrast to individuals treated with long-term antiretroviral therapy, intact proviral sequences from elite controllers were integrated at highly distinct sites in the human genome and were preferentially located in centromeric satellite DNA or in Krüppel-associated box domain-containing zinc finger genes on chromosome 19, both of which are associated with heterochromatin features. Moreover, the integration sites of intact proviral sequences from elite controllers showed an increased distance to transcriptional start sites and accessible chromatin of the host genome and were enriched in repressive chromatin marks. These data suggest that a distinct configuration of the proviral reservoir represents a structural correlate of natural viral control, and that the quality, rather than the quantity, of viral reservoirs can be an important distinguishing feature for a functional cure of HIV-1 infection. Moreover, in one elite controller, we were unable to detect intact proviral sequences despite analysing more than 1.5 billion peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which raises the possibility that a sterilizing cure of HIV-1 infection, which has previously been observed only following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation2,3, may be feasible in rare instances."
https://openalex.org/W2996825230,"The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), one of the best studied palaeoclimatic intervals, offers an excellent opportunity to investigate how the climate system responds to changes in greenhouse gases and the cryosphere. Previous work has sought to constrain the magnitude and pattern of glacial cooling from palaeothermometers1,2, but the uneven distribution of the proxies, as well as their uncertainties, has challenged the construction of a full-field view of the LGM climate state. Here we combine a large collection of geochemical proxies for sea surface temperature with an isotope-enabled climate model ensemble to produce a field reconstruction of LGM temperatures using data assimilation. The reconstruction is validated with withheld proxies as well as independent ice core and speleothem δ18O measurements. Our assimilated product provides a constraint on global mean LGM cooling of −6.1 degrees Celsius (95 per cent confidence interval: −6.5 to −5.7 degrees Celsius). Given assumptions concerning the radiative forcing of greenhouse gases, ice sheets and mineral dust aerosols, this cooling translates to an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.4 degrees Celsius (2.4–4.5 degrees Celsius), a value that is higher than previous LGM-based estimates but consistent with the traditional consensus range of 2–4.5 degrees Celsius3,4. A compilation of proxy data are used with an isotope-enabled climate model ensemble to constrain cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum, producing estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity that agree well with the current consensus range."

https://openalex.org/W3080783441,"This is a population-based prospective cohort study on archive data describing the age- and sex-specific prevalence of COVID-19 and its prognostic factors. All 2653 symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from February 27 to April 2, 2020 in the Reggio Emilia province, Italy, were included. COVID-19 cumulative incidence, hospitalization and death rates, and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated according to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Females had higher prevalence of infection than males below age 50 (2.61 vs. 1.84 ‰), but lower in older ages (16.49 vs. 20.86 ‰ over age 80). Case fatality rate reached 20.7% in cases with more than 4 weeks follow up. After adjusting for age and comorbidities, men had a higher risk of hospitalization (HR 1.4 95% CI 1.2 to 1.6) and of death (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1). Patients over age 80 compared to age < 50 had HR 7.1 (95% CI 5.4 to 9.3) and HR 27.8 (95% CI 12.5 to 61.7) for hospitalization and death, respectively. Immigrants had a higher risk of hospitalization (HR 1.3, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.81) than Italians and a similar risk of death. Risk of hospitalization and of death were higher in patients with heart failure, arrhythmia, dementia, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension, while COPD increased the risk of hospitalization (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.5) but not of death (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.7). Previous use of ACE inhibitors had no effect on risk of death (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.34). Identified susceptible populations and fragile patients should be considered when setting priorities in public health planning and clinical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3080122093,"Speciation rates vary considerably among lineages, and our understanding of what drives the rapid succession of speciation events within young adaptive radiations remains incomplete1–11. The cichlid fish family provides a notable example of such variation, with many slowly speciating lineages as well as several exceptionally large and rapid radiations12. Here, by reconstructing a large phylogeny of all currently described cichlid species, we show that explosive speciation is solely concentrated in species flocks of several large young lakes. Increases in the speciation rate are associated with the absence of top predators; however, this does not sufficiently explain explosive speciation. Across lake radiations, we observe a positive relationship between the speciation rate and enrichment of large insertion or deletion polymorphisms. Assembly of 100 cichlid genomes within the most rapidly speciating cichlid radiation, which is found in Lake Victoria, reveals exceptional ‘genomic potential’—hundreds of ancient haplotypes bear insertion or deletion polymorphisms, many of which are associated with specific ecologies and shared with ecologically similar species from other older radiations elsewhere in Africa. Network analysis reveals fundamentally non-treelike evolution through recombining old haplotypes, and the origins of ecological guilds are concentrated early in the radiation. Our results suggest that the combination of ecological opportunity, sexual selection and exceptional genomic potential is the key to understanding explosive adaptive radiation. Analyses of the genomes of cichlid species reveal that the combination of ecological opportunity, sexual selection and exceptional genomic potential is the key to understanding explosive adaptive radiation in cichlids."
https://openalex.org/W3100749447,"Technologies that rely on quantum bits (qubits) require long coherence times and high-fidelity operations1. Superconducting qubits are one of the leading platforms for achieving these objectives2,3. However, the coherence of superconducting qubits is affected by the breaking of Cooper pairs of electrons4–6. The experimentally observed density of the broken Cooper pairs, referred to as quasiparticles, is orders of magnitude higher than the value predicted at equilibrium by the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory of superconductivity7–9. Previous work10–12 has shown that infrared photons considerably increase the quasiparticle density, yet even in the best-isolated systems, it remains much higher10 than expected, suggesting that another generation mechanism exists13. Here we provide evidence that ionizing radiation from environmental radioactive materials and cosmic rays contributes to this observed difference. The effect of ionizing radiation leads to an elevated quasiparticle density, which we predict would ultimately limit the coherence times of superconducting qubits of the type measured here to milliseconds. We further demonstrate that radiation shielding reduces the flux of ionizing radiation and thereby increases the energy-relaxation time. Albeit a small effect for today’s qubits, reducing or mitigating the impact of ionizing radiation will be critical for realizing fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers. Ionizing radiation from environmental radioactivity and cosmic rays increases the density of broken Cooper pairs in superconducting qubits, reducing their coherence times, but can be partially mitigated by lead shielding."
https://openalex.org/W3081133783,"Transmembrane channels and pores have key roles in fundamental biological processes1 and in biotechnological applications such as DNA nanopore sequencing2–4, resulting in considerable interest in the design of pore-containing proteins. Synthetic amphiphilic peptides have been found to form ion channels5,6, and there have been recent advances in de novo membrane protein design7,8 and in redesigning naturally occurring channel-containing proteins9,10. However, the de novo design of stable, well-defined transmembrane protein pores that are capable of conducting ions selectively or are large enough to enable the passage of small-molecule fluorophores remains an outstanding challenge11,12. Here we report the computational design of protein pores formed by two concentric rings of α-helices that are stable and monodisperse in both their water-soluble and their transmembrane forms. Crystal structures of the water-soluble forms of a 12-helical pore and a 16-helical pore closely match the computational design models. Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments show that, when expressed in insect cells, the transmembrane form of the 12-helix pore enables the passage of ions across the membrane with high selectivity for potassium over sodium; ion passage is blocked by specific chemical modification at the pore entrance. When incorporated into liposomes using in vitro protein synthesis, the transmembrane form of the 16-helix pore—but not the 12-helix pore—enables the passage of biotinylated Alexa Fluor 488. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 16-helix transmembrane pore closely matches the design model. The ability to produce structurally and functionally well-defined transmembrane pores opens the door to the creation of designer channels and pores for a wide variety of applications. An approach for the design of protein pores is demonstrated by the computational design and subsequent experimental expression of both an ion-selective and a large transmembrane pore."
https://openalex.org/W3080219868,"Tight coupling of transcription and translation is considered a defining feature of bacterial gene expression1,2. The pioneering ribosome can both physically associate and kinetically coordinate with RNA polymerase (RNAP)3-11, forming a signal-integration hub for co-transcriptional regulation that includes translation-based attenuation12,13 and RNA quality control2. However, it remains unclear whether transcription-translation coupling-together with its broad functional consequences-is indeed a fundamental characteristic of bacteria other than Escherichia coli. Here we show that RNAPs outpace pioneering ribosomes in the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and that this 'runaway transcription' creates alternative rules for both global RNA surveillance and translational control of nascent RNA. In particular, uncoupled RNAPs in B. subtilis explain the diminished role of Rho-dependent transcription termination, as well as the prevalence of mRNA leaders that use riboswitches and RNA-binding proteins. More broadly, we identified widespread genomic signatures of runaway transcription in distinct phyla across the bacterial domain. Our results show that coupled RNAP-ribosome movement is not a general hallmark of bacteria. Instead, translation-coupled transcription and runaway transcription constitute two principal modes of gene expression that determine genome-specific regulatory mechanisms in prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W3081076923,"Atmospheric warming threatens to accelerate the retreat of the Antarctic Ice Sheet by increasing surface melting and facilitating ‘hydrofracturing’1–7, where meltwater flows into and enlarges fractures, potentially triggering ice-shelf collapse3–5,8–10. The collapse of ice shelves that buttress11–13 the ice sheet accelerates ice flow and sea-level rise14–16. However, we do not know if and how much of the buttressing regions of Antarctica’s ice shelves are vulnerable to hydrofracture if inundated with water. Here we provide two lines of evidence suggesting that many buttressing regions are vulnerable. First, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to map the surface expressions of fractures in satellite imagery across all Antarctic ice shelves. Second, we developed a stability diagram of fractures based on linear elastic fracture mechanics to predict where basal and dry surface fractures form under current stress conditions. We find close agreement between the theoretical prediction and the DCNN-mapped fractures, despite limitations associated with detecting fractures in satellite imagery. Finally, we used linear elastic fracture mechanics theory to predict where surface fractures would become unstable if filled with water. Many regions regularly inundated with meltwater today are resilient to hydrofracture—stresses are low enough that all water-filled fractures are stable. Conversely, 60 ± 10 per cent of ice shelves (by area) both buttress upstream ice and are vulnerable to hydrofracture if inundated with water. The DCNN map confirms the presence of fractures in these buttressing regions. Increased surface melting17 could trigger hydrofracturing if it leads to water inundating the widespread vulnerable regions we identify. These regions are where atmospheric warming may have the largest impact on ice-sheet mass balance. Using a neural network trained on continent-wide data and a fracture model, the ice shelves in Antarctica that may be prone to hydrofracturing under further atmospheric warming are identified."
https://openalex.org/W3049565363,"Disparate biases associated with datasets and trained classifiers in hateful and abusive content identification tasks have raised many concerns recently. Although the problem of biased datasets on abusive language detection has been addressed more frequently, biases arising from trained classifiers have not yet been a matter of concern. Here, we first introduce a transfer learning approach for hate speech detection based on an existing pre-trained language model called BERT and evaluate the proposed model on two publicly available datasets annotated for racism, sexism, hate or offensive content on Twitter. Next, we introduce a bias alleviation mechanism in hate speech detection task to mitigate the effect of bias in training set during the fine-tuning of our pre-trained BERT-based model. Toward that end, we use an existing regularization method to reweight input samples, thereby decreasing the effects of high correlated training set' s n-grams with class labels, and then fine-tune our pre-trained BERT-based model with the new re-weighted samples. To evaluate our bias alleviation mechanism, we employ a cross-domain approach in which we use the trained classifiers on the aforementioned datasets to predict the labels of two new datasets from Twitter, AAE-aligned and White-aligned groups, which indicate tweets written in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE) respectively. The results show the existence of systematic racial bias in trained classifiers as they tend to assign tweets written in AAE from AAE-aligned group to negative classes such as racism, sexism, hate, and offensive more often than tweets written in SAE from White-aligned. However, the racial bias in our classifiers reduces significantly after our bias alleviation mechanism is incorporated. This work could institute the first step towards debiasing hate speech and abusive language detection systems."
https://openalex.org/W3081224187,"Glandular epithelia, including the mammary and prostate glands, are composed of basal cells (BCs) and luminal cells (LCs)1,2. Many glandular epithelia develop from multipotent basal stem cells (BSCs) that are replaced in adult life by distinct pools of unipotent stem cells1,3–8. However, adult unipotent BSCs can reactivate multipotency under regenerative conditions and upon oncogene expression3,9–13. This suggests that an active mechanism restricts BSC multipotency under normal physiological conditions, although the nature of this mechanism is unknown. Here we show that the ablation of LCs reactivates the multipotency of BSCs from multiple epithelia both in vivo in mice and in vitro in organoids. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that, after LC ablation, BSCs activate a hybrid basal and luminal cell differentiation program before giving rise to LCs—reminiscent of the genetic program that regulates multipotency during embryonic development7. By predicting ligand–receptor pairs from single-cell data14, we find that TNF—which is secreted by LCs—restricts BC multipotency under normal physiological conditions. By contrast, the Notch, Wnt and EGFR pathways were activated in BSCs and their progeny after LC ablation; blocking these pathways, or stimulating the TNF pathway, inhibited regeneration-induced BC multipotency. Our study demonstrates that heterotypic communication between LCs and BCs is essential to maintain lineage fidelity in glandular epithelial stem cells. The multipotency of basal stem cells is directly regulated by luminal cells through the secretion of TNF, and, following luminal cell ablation, the Notch, Wnt and EGFR signalling pathways reactivate basal cell multipotency."
https://openalex.org/W3081367893,"The properties of knots are exploited in a range of applications, from shoelaces to the knots used for climbing, fishing and sailing1. Although knots are found in DNA and proteins2, and form randomly in other long polymer chains3,4, methods for tying5 different sorts of knots in a synthetic nanoscale strand are lacking. Molecular knots of high symmetry have previously been synthesized by using non-covalent interactions to assemble and entangle molecular chains6–15, but in such instances the template and/or strand structure intrinsically determines topology, which means that only one type of knot is usually possible. Here we show that interspersing coordination sites for different metal ions within an artificial molecular strand enables it to be tied into multiple knots. Three topoisomers—an unknot (01) macrocycle, a trefoil (31) knot6–15, and a three-twist (52) knot—were each selectively prepared from the same molecular strand by using transition-metal and lanthanide ions to guide chain folding in a manner reminiscent of the action of protein chaperones16. We find that the metal-ion-induced folding can proceed with stereoinduction: in the case of one knot, a lanthanide(iii)-coordinated crossing pattern formed only with a copper(i)-coordinated crossing of particular handedness. In an unanticipated finding, metal-ion coordination was also found to translocate an entanglement from one region of a knotted molecular structure to another, resulting in an increase in writhe (topological strain) in the new knotted conformation. The knot topology affects the chemical properties of the strand: whereas the tighter 52 knot can bind two different metal ions simultaneously, the looser 31 isomer can bind only either one copper(i) ion or one lutetium(iii) ion. The ability to tie nanoscale chains into different knots offers opportunities to explore the modification of the structure and properties of synthetic oligomers, polymers and supramolecules. A molecular strand can be knotted and unknotted into three different topologies, depending on the complexing metal ion used (copper or lanthanide or none)."

https://openalex.org/W3081042567,"Mutation of C9orf72 is the most prevalent defect associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration1. Together with hexanucleotide-repeat expansion2,3, haploinsufficiency of C9orf72 contributes to neuronal dysfunction4-6. Here we determine the structure of the C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex by cryo-electron microscopy. C9orf72 and SMCR8 both contain longin and DENN (differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells) domains7, and WDR41 is a β-propeller protein that binds to SMCR8 such that the whole structure resembles an eye slip hook. Contacts between WDR41 and the DENN domain of SMCR8 drive the lysosomal localization of the complex in conditions of amino acid starvation. The structure suggested that C9orf72-SMCR8 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), and we found that C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 acts as a GAP for the ARF family of small GTPases. These data shed light on the function of C9orf72 in normal physiology, and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3080640400,"Abstract The dominant paradigm for HPV carcinogenesis includes integration into the host genome followed by expression of E6 and E7 (E6/E7). We explored an alternative carcinogenic pathway characterized by episomal E2, E4, and E5 (E2/E4/E5) expression. Half of HPV positive cervical and pharyngeal cancers comprised a subtype with increase in expression of E2/E4/E5, as well as association with lack of integration into the host genome. Models of the E2/E4/E5 carcinogenesis show p53 dependent enhanced proliferation in vitro, as well as increased susceptibility to induction of cancer in vivo. Whole genomic expression analysis of the E2/E4/E5 pharyngeal cancer subtype is defined by activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway and this subtype is susceptible to combination FGFR and mTOR inhibition, with implications for targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2974573793,"At the end of mitosis, eukaryotic cells must segregate the two copies of their replicated genome into two new nuclear compartments1. They do this either by first dismantling and later reassembling the nuclear envelope in an 'open mitosis' or by reshaping an intact nucleus and then dividing it into two in a 'closed mitosis'2,3. Mitosis has been studied in a wide variety of eukaryotes for more than a century4, but how the double membrane of the nuclear envelope is split into two at the end of a closed mitosis without compromising the impermeability of the nuclear compartment remains unknown5. Here, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (a classical model for closed mitosis5), genetics, live-cell imaging and electron tomography, we show that nuclear fission is achieved via local disassembly of nuclear pores within the narrow bridge that links segregating daughter nuclei. In doing so, we identify the protein Les1, which is localized to the inner nuclear envelope and restricts the process of local nuclear envelope breakdown to the bridge midzone to prevent the leakage of material from daughter nuclei. The mechanism of local nuclear envelope breakdown in a closed mitosis therefore closely mirrors nuclear envelope breakdown in open mitosis3, revealing an unexpectedly high conservation of nuclear remodelling mechanisms across diverse eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W3081334000,"Paclitaxel as a microtubule-stabilizing agent is widely used for the treatment of a vast range of cancers. Corylus avellana cell suspension culture (CSC) is a promising strategy for paclitaxel production. Elicitation of paclitaxel biosynthesis pathway is a key approach for improving its production in cell culture. However, optimization of this process is time-consuming and costly. Modeling of paclitaxel elicitation process can be helpful to predict the optimal condition for its high production in cell culture. The objective of this study was modeling and forecasting paclitaxel biosynthesis in C. avellana cell culture responding cell extract (CE), culture filtrate (CF) and cell wall (CW) derived from endophytic fungus, either individually or combined treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD), based on four input variables including concentration levels of fungal elicitors and MBCD, elicitor adding day and CSC harvesting time, using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multiple regression methods. The results displayed a higher accuracy of ANFIS models (0.94–0.97) as compared to regression models (0.16–0.54). The great accordance between the predicted and observed values of paclitaxel biosynthesis for both training and testing subsets support excellent performance of developed ANFIS models. Optimization process of developed ANFIS models with genetic algorithm (GA) showed that optimal MBCD (47.65 mM) and CW (2.77% (v/v)) concentration levels, elicitor adding day (16) and CSC harvesting time (139 h and 41 min after elicitation) can lead to highest paclitaxel biosynthesis (427.92 μg l-1). The validation experiment showed that ANFIS-GA method can be a promising tool for selecting the optimal conditions for maximum paclitaxel biosynthesis, as a case study."

This study focuses to explore that how environmental performance is affected by these economic, political and social indicators by using the annual data of 163 developed and developing countries covering the time period of 1996-2016.The data is collected from World Development Indicators, World Governance Indicators, Freedom House and Cline Centre. The stationarity of variables is analyzed through LLC, IPS and ADF Fisher Chi-square test.

The findings of study highlight that ethnic diversity; institutional quality and political freedom play a significant role to decrease CO2emissions while energy consumption, GDP growth and financial development are increasing the environmental degradation. Ethnic diversity is a source of creative and innovative approaches about problem solving of environmental degradation. Political freedom allows people to participate in decision making that posits much compliance with environmental agreements. The foreign direct investment is attracted by good quality institutions which cause to advent of more environment friendly technology along with attractions for further innovations that may helpful to reduce CO2 emissions. Contrary, GDP growth, financial development and energy consumption enhance the industrialization and urbanization leading to increase the level of CO2 emissions. It is suggested for policy makers that cohesion among different ethnic groups; improving institutional quality; providing political freedom to people and inclusive financial sector will acknowledge the less pollutant environment."
https://openalex.org/W3080613857,"In the Netherlands, there was a sharp increase in the number of suicides among 10- to 19-year-olds in 2017. A multi-method psychological autopsy study (PA) was conducted to assess feasibility, identify related factors, and study the interplay of these factors to inform suicide prevention strategies.Coroners identified youth suicides in 2017 in their records and then general practitioners (GPs) contacted the parents of these youths. Over a period of 7 months, 66 qualitative interviews were held with the parents, peers, and teachers, providing information on precipitating factors and five topics involving 35 cases (17 boys and 18 girls, mean age 17 years). Furthermore, 43 parents and care professionals filled in questionnaires to examine risk and care-related factors. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed.Although registration problems faced by coroners and resistance to contacting bereaved families by GPs hampered the recruitment, most parents highly appreciated being interviewed. Several adverse childhood experiences played a role at an individual level, such as (cyber) bullying, parental divorce, sexual abuse, as well as complex mental disorders, and previous suicide attempts. Two specific patterns stood out: (1) girls characterized by insecurity and a perfectionist attitude, who developed psychopathology and dropped out of school, and (2) boys with a developmental disorder, such as autism, who were transferred to special needs education and therefore felt rejected. In addition, adolescents with complex problems had difficulty finding appropriate formal care. Regarding potential new trends, contagion effects of social media use in a clinical setting and internet use for searching lethal methods were found.This first national PA study showed that, as expected, a variety of mostly complex clusters of problems played a role in youth suicides. An infrastructure is needed to continuously monitor, evaluate, and support families after each youth suicide and thereby improve prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3080978765,"Lipids secreted by the meibomian glands (MGs) of the eyelids are essential to the protection of the eye's surface. An altered meibum composition represents the primary cause of evaporative dry eye disease (DED). Despite the critical importance of the meibum, its biosynthetic pathways and the roles of individual lipid components remain understudied. Here, we report that the genetic deletion of Acyl-CoA:wax alcohol acyltransferase 2 (AWAT2) causes the obstruction of MGs and symptoms of evaporative DED in mice. The lipid composition of the meibum isolated from Awat2−/− mice revealed the absence of wax esters, which was accompanied by a compensatory overproduction of cholesteryl esters. The resulting increased viscosity of meibum led to the dilation of the meibomian ducts, and the progressive degeneration of the MGs. Overall, we provide evidence for the main physiological role of AWAT2 and establish Awat2−/− mice as a model for DED syndrome that can be used in studies on tear film-oriented therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3080568141,"Introduction Despite the broad success of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs, HIV care engagement during the pregnancy and postpartum periods is suboptimal. This study explored the perspectives of women who experienced challenges engaging in PMTCT care, in order to better understand factors that contribute to poor retention and to identify opportunities to improve PMTCT services. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews with 12 postpartum women to discuss their experiences with PMTCT care. We used data from a larger longitudinal cohort study conducted in five PMTCT clinics in Moshi, Tanzania to identify women with indicators of poor care engagement (i.e., medication non-adherence, inconsistent clinic attendance, or high viral load). Women who met one of these criteria were contacted by telephone and invited to complete an interview. Data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis. Results We observed a common pathway that fear of stigma contributed to a lack of HIV disclosure and reduced social support for seeking HIV care. Women commonly distrusted the results of their initial HIV test and reported medication side effects after care initiation. Women also reported barriers in the health system, including difficult-to-navigate clinic transfer policies and a lack of privacy and confidentiality in service provision. When asked how care might be improved, women felt that improved counseling and follow-up, affirming patient-provider interactions, and peer treatment supporters would have a positive effect on care engagement. Conclusion In order to improve the impact of PMTCT programs, there is a need to implement active tracking and follow-up of patients, targeting individuals with evidence of poor care engagement. Tailored supportive intervention approaches may help patients to cope with both the perceived and actual impacts of HIV stigma, including navigating disclosures to loved ones and accessing social support. Fostering HIV acceptance is likely to facilitate commitment to long-term treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3080094789,"For many tumor types chemotherapy still represents the therapy of choice and many standard treatments are based on the use of platinum (PT) drugs. However, de novo or acquired resistance to platinum is frequent and leads to disease progression. In Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) patients, PT-resistant recurrences are very common and improving the response to treatment still represents an unmet clinical need. To identify new modulators of PT-sensitivity, we performed a loss-of-function screening targeting 680 genes potentially involved in the response of EOC cells to platinum. We found that SGK2 (Serum-and Glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 2) plays a key role in PT-response. We show here that EOC cells relay on the induction of autophagy to escape PT-induced death and that SGK2 inhibition increases PT sensitivity inducing a block in the autophagy cascade due to the impairment of lysosomal acidification. Mechanistically we demonstrate that SGK2 controls autophagy in a kinase-dependent manner by binding and inhibiting the V-ATPase proton pump. Accordingly, SGK2 phosphorylates the subunit V1H (ATP6V1H) of V-ATPase and silencing or chemical inhibition of SGK2, affects the normal autophagic flux and sensitizes EOC cells to platinum. Hence, we identified a new pathway that links autophagy to the survival of cancer cells under platinum treatment in which the druggable kinase SGK2 plays a central role. Our data suggest that blocking autophagy via SGK2 inhibition could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to improve patients' response to platinum."
https://openalex.org/W3081083099,"As passive investment through index funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) has become pervasive, the structure of corporate control in the global capital market is more complex than before. We propose a new model and calculation algorithm to measure a shareholder’s power to control corporations in the global economy. Our method takes into account how fragmented voting rights attached to dispersed ownership may be consolidated to generate corporate control. Analyzing the ownership holdings in 49 million companies worldwide by 69 million shareholders in 2016, we find that the landscape of global corporate control appears differently if we adequately evaluate indirect influence via dispersed ownership. In particular, a larger portion of corporate control appears to be concentrated in the hands of sovereign governments than has been recognized before. Yet, such governmental capacities are “hidden” if we use the conventional method. Moreover, financial institutions appear to not be as powerful as emphasized before. These results point to important financial and political risks both for scholars and policymakers."

Objective We aimed to derive models for hospital mortality, 180-day mortality and 30-day readmission, implement these models within our electronic health record and prospectively validate these models for use across an entire health system. Materials & methods We developed, integrated into our electronic health record and prospectively validated three predictive models using logistic regression from data collected from patients 18 to 99 years old who had an inpatient or observation admission at NorthShore University HealthSystem, a four-hospital integrated system in the United States, from January 2012 to September 2018. We analyzed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for model performance. Results Models were derived and validated at three time points: retrospective, prospective at discharge, and prospective at 4 hours after presentation. AUCs of hospital mortality were 0.91, 0.89 and 0.77, respectively. AUCs for 30-day readmission were 0.71, 0.71 and 0.69, respectively. 180-day mortality models were only retrospectively validated with an AUC of 0.85. Discussion We were able to retain good model performance while optimizing potential model impact by also valuing model derivation efficiency, usability, sensitivity, generalizability and ability to prescribe timely interventions to reduce underlying risk. Measuring model impact by tying prediction models to interventions that are then rapidly tested will establish a path for meaningful clinical improvement and implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3080525242,"Epithelial ovarian carcinoma tissues express high levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and other inflammatory cytokines. The underlying mechanism leading to the abnormal TNF-α expression in ovarian cancer remains poorly understood. In the current study, we demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid mediator present in ascites of ovarian cancer patients, induced expression of TNF-α mRNA and release of TNF-α protein in ovarian cancer cells. LPA also induced expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) mRNA but no significant increase in IL-1β protein was detected. LPA enhanced TNF-α mRNA through NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activation. Inactivation of ADAM17, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase, with a specific inhibitor TMI-1 or by shRNA knockdown prevented ovarian cancer cells from releasing TNF-α protein in response to LPA, indicating that LPA-mediated TNF-α production relies on both transcriptional upregulations of the TNF-α gene and the activity of ADAM17, the membrane-associated TNF-α-converting enzyme. Like many other biological responses to LPA, induction of TNF-α by LPA also depended on the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Interestingly, our results revealed that ADAM17 was also the shedding protease responsible for the transactivation of EGFR by LPA in ovarian cancer cells. To explore the biological outcomes of LPA-induced TNF-α, we examined the effects of a TNF-α neutralizing antibody and recombinant TNF-α soluble receptor on LPA-stimulated expression of pro-tumorigenic cytokines and chemokines overexpressed in ovarian cancer. Blockade of TNF-α signaling significantly reduced the production of IL-8, IL-6, and CXCL1, suggesting a hierarchy of mechanisms contributing to the robust expression of the inflammatory mediators in response to LPA in ovarian cancer cells. In contrast, TNF-α inhibition did not affect LPA-dependent cell proliferation. Taken together, our results establish that the bioactive lipid LPA drives the expression of TNF-α to regulate an inflammatory network in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3080640760,"Growing evidence supports a central role of NADPH oxidases (NOXs) in the regulation of platelets, which are circulating cells involved in both hemostasis and thrombosis. Here, the use of Nox1−/− and Nox1+/+ mice as experimental models of human responses demonstrated a critical role of NOX1 in collagen-dependent platelet activation and pathological arterial thrombosis, as tested in vivo by carotid occlusion assays. In contrast, NOX1 does not affect platelet responses to thrombin and normal hemostasis, as assayed in tail bleeding experiments. Therefore, as NOX1 inhibitors are likely to have antiplatelet effects without associated bleeding risks, the NOX1-selective inhibitor 2-acetylphenothiazine (2APT) and a series of its derivatives generated to increase inhibitory potency and drug bioavailability were tested. Among the 2APT derivatives, 1-(10H-phenothiazin-2-yl)vinyl tert-butyl carbonate (2APT-D6) was selected for its high potency. Both 2APT and 2APT-D6 inhibited collagen-dependent platelet aggregation, adhesion, thrombus formation, superoxide anion generation, and surface activation marker expression, while responses to thrombin or adhesion to fibrinogen were not affected. In vivo administration of 2APT or 2APT-D6 led to the inhibition of mouse platelet aggregation, oxygen radical output, and thrombus formation, and carotid occlusion, while tail hemostasis was unaffected. Differently to in vitro experiments, 2APT-D6 and 2APT displayed similar potency in vivo. In summary, NOX1 inhibition with 2APT or its derivative 2APT-D6 is a viable strategy to control collagen-induced platelet activation and reduce thrombosis without deleterious effects on hemostasis. These compounds should, therefore, be considered for the development of novel antiplatelet drugs to fight cardiovascular diseases in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3080135216,"Radiotherapy is one of the most effective treatments for head and neck tumors. However, delayed radiation-induced brain necrosis (RN) remains a serious issue due to the lack of satisfying prevention and effective treatment. The pathological role of radiation in the delayed onset of brain necrosis is still largely unknown, and the traditional animal model of whole brain irradiation, although being widely used, does not produce reliable and localized brain necrosis mimicking clinical features of RN. In this study, we demonstrated a successful RN mouse model using optimized gamma knife irradiation in male C57BL/6 mice. On the premise that brain necrosis started to appear at 6 weeks postirradiation in our RN model, as confirmed by both MRI and histopathological examinations, we systematically examined different time points before the onset of RN for the histopathological changes and biochemical indicators. Our initial results demonstrated that in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the irradiated brains, a significant decrease in neuronal numbers that occurred at 4 weeks and a sustained increase in TNF-α, iNOS, and other inflammatory cytokines beginning at 1-week postirradiation. Changes of cell morphology and cell numbers of both microglia and astrocytes occurred as early as 1-week postirradiation, and intervention by bevacizumab administration resulted in reduced microglia activation and reduction of radiation-induced lesion volume, indicating that chronic glial activation may result in subsequent elevation of inflammatory factors, which led to the delayed onset of neuronal loss and brain necrosis. Since C57BL/6 is the most widely used strain of genetic engineered mouse model, our data provide an invaluable platform for the mechanistic study of RN pathogenesis, identification of potential imaging and biological biomarkers, and the development of therapeutic treatment for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3080289515,"Distinct lineages of Gammaproteobacteria clade Woeseiales are globally distributed in marine sediments, based on metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene analysis. Yet little is known about why they are dominant or their ecological role in Arctic fjord sediments, where glacial retreat is rapidly imposing change. This study combined 16S rRNA gene analysis, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), and genome-resolved metatranscriptomics uncovered the in situ abundance and transcriptional activity of Woeseiales with burial in four shallow sediment sites of Kongsfjorden and Van Keulenfjorden of Svalbard (79°N). We present five novel Woeseiales MAGs and show transcriptional evidence for metabolic plasticity during burial, including sulfur oxidation with reverse dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrAB) down to 4 cm depth and nitrite reduction down to 6 cm depth. A single stress protein, spore protein SP21 (hspA), had a tenfold higher mRNA abundance than any other transcript, and was a hundredfold higher on average than other transcripts. At three out of the four sites, SP21 transcript abundance increased with depth, while total mRNA abundance and richness decreased, indicating a shift in investment from metabolism and other cellular processes to build-up of spore protein SP21. The SP21 gene in MAGs was often flanked by genes involved in membrane-associated stress response. The ability of Woeseiales to shift from sulfur oxidation to nitrite reduction with burial into marine sediments with decreasing access to overlying oxic bottom waters, as well as enter into a dormant state dominated by SP21, may account for its ubiquity and high abundance in marine sediments worldwide, including those of the rapidly shifting Arctic."
https://openalex.org/W3080564163,"Thiol-based redox regulation is a post-translational protein modification for controlling enzyme activity by switching oxidation/reduction states of Cys residues. In plant cells, numerous proteins involved in a wide range of biological systems have been suggested as the target of redox regulation; however, our knowledge on this issue is still incomplete. Here we report that 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH) is a novel redox-regulated protein. PGDH catalyzes the first committed step of Ser biosynthetic pathway in plastids. Using an affinity chromatography-based method, we found that PGDH physically interacts with thioredoxin (Trx), a key factor of redox regulation. The in vitro studies using recombinant proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana showed that a specific PGDH isoform, PGDH1, forms the intramolecular disulfide bond under nonreducing conditions, which lowers PGDH enzyme activity. MS and site-directed mutagenesis analyses allowed us to identify the redox-active Cys pair that is mainly involved in disulfide bond formation in PGDH1; this Cys pair is uniquely found in land plant PGDH. Furthermore, we revealed that some plastidial Trx subtypes support the reductive activation of PGDH1. The present data show previously uncharacterized regulatory mechanisms of PGDH and expand our understanding of the Trx-mediated redox-regulatory network in plants."
https://openalex.org/W3081416127,"Cancer can metastasize from early lesions without detectable tumors. Despite extensive studies on metastasis in cancer cells from patients with detectable primary tumors, mechanisms for early metastatic dissemination are poorly understood. Her2 promotes breast cancer early dissemination by inhibiting p38, but the downstream pathway in this process was unknown. Using early lesion breast cancer models, we demonstrate that the effect of p38 suppression by Her2 on early dissemination is mediated by MK2 and heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27). The early disseminating cells in the MMTV-Her2 breast cancer model are Her2highp-p38lowp-MK2lowp-Hsp27low, which also exist in human breast carcinoma tissues. Suppression of p38 and MK2 by Her2 reduces MK2-mediated Hsp27 phosphorylation, and unphosphorylated Hsp27 binds to β-catenin and enhances its phosphorylation by Src, leading to β-catenin activation and disseminating phenotypes in early lesion breast cancer cells. Pharmacological inhibition of MK2 promotes, while inhibition of a p38 phosphatase Wip1 suppresses, early dissemination in vivo. These findings identify Her2-mediated suppression of the p38-MK2-Hsp27 pathway as a novel mechanism for cancer early dissemination, and provide a basis for new therapies targeting early metastatic dissemination in Her2+ breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3080093217,"Lactic acid (LA) is a byproduct of glycolysis resulting from intense exercise or a metabolic defect in aerobic processes. LA metabolism is essential to prevent lactic acidosis, but the mechanism through which LA regulates its own metabolism is largely unknown. Here, we identified a LA-responsive protein, named LRPGC1, which has a distinct role from PGC1α, a key metabolic regulator, and report that LRPGC1 particularly mediates LA response to activate liver LA metabolism. Following LA stimulation, LRPGC1, but not PGC1α, translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus through deactivation of nuclear export signals, interacts with the nuclear receptor ERRγ, and upregulates TFAM, which ensures mitochondrial biogenesis. Knockout of PGC1 gene in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells decreased the LA consumption and TFAM expression, which were rescued by LRPGC1 expression, but not by PGC1α. These LRPGC1-induced effects were mediated by ERRγ, concomitantly with mitochondrial activation. The response element for LRPGC1/ERRγ signaling pathway was identified in TFAM promoter. Notably, the survival rate of a mouse model of lactic acidosis was reduced by the liver-targeted silencing of Lrpgc1, while it was significantly ameliorated by the pharmacological activation of ERRγ. These findings demonstrate LA-responsive transactivation via LRPGC1 that highlight an intrinsic molecular mechanism for LA homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3080150447,"Bears do not suffer from osteoporosis during hibernation, which is associated with long-term inactivity, lack of food intake, and cold exposure. However, the mechanisms involved in bone loss prevention have scarcely been elucidated in bears. We investigated the effect of serum from hibernating Japanese black bears (Ursus thibetanus japonicus) on differentiation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to osteoclasts (OCs). PBMCs collected from 3 bears were separately cultured with 10% serum of 4 active and 4 hibernating bears (each individual serum type was assessed separately by a bear PBMCs), and differentiation were induced by treatment with macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL). PBMCs that were cultured with the active bear serum containing medium (ABSM) differentiated to multi-nucleated OCs, and were positive for TRAP stain. However, cells supplemented with hibernating bear serum containing medium (HBSM) failed to form OCs, and showed significantly lower TRAP stain (p < 0.001). On the other hand, HBSM induced proliferation of adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) similarly to ABSM (p > 0.05), indicating no difference on cell growth. It was revealed that osteoclastogenesis of PBMCs is hindered by HBSM, implying an underlying mechanism for the suppressed bone resorption during hibernation in bears. In addition, this study for the first time showed the formation of bears’ OCs in-vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3080462344,"Rapid diagnostic tests are first-line assays for diagnosing infectious diseases, such as malaria. To minimize false positive and false negative test results in population-screening assays, high-quality reagents and well-characterized antigens and antibodies are needed. An important property of antigen-antibody binding is recognition specificity, which best can be estimated by mapping an antibody's epitope on the respective antigen. We have cloned a malarial antigen-containing fusion protein, MBP-pfMSP119, in Escherichia coli, which then was structurally and functionally characterized before and after high pressure-assisted enzymatic digestion. We then used our previously developed method, intact transition epitope mapping-targeted high-energy rupture of extracted epitopes (ITEM-THREE), to map the area on the MBP-pfMSP119 antigen surface that is recognized by the anti-pfMSP119 antibody G17.12. We identified three epitope-carrying peptides, 386GRNISQHQCVKKQCPQNSGCFRHLDE411, 386GRNISQHQCVKKQCPQNSGCFRHLDEREE414, and 415CKCLLNYKQE424, from the GluC-derived peptide mixture. These peptides belong to an assembled (conformational) epitope on the MBP-pfMSP119 antigen whose identification was substantiated by positive and negative control experiments. In conclusion, our data help to establish a workflow to obtain high-quality control data for diagnostic assays, including the use of ITEM-THREE as a powerful analytical tool. Data are available via ProteomeXchange: PXD019717."
https://openalex.org/W3080491096,"We report trends in mortality patterns and causes among HIV positive patients, who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART), at an urban clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe.A retrospective cohort study was conducted in which routinely collected data for patients enrolled and followed up between February 2004 and December 2017 were assessed. Patients follow up was from the day of the treatment initiation until exit by death, transfer out or loss to follow up. Two doctors categorized causes of death (COD) as tuberculosis (TB), communicable AIDS, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), malignancies, others and unknown. We used competing risk survival analysis, first to estimate all-causes and cause-specific mortality rates over time, and then to assess risk factors of different causes of death.A total of 4 868 patients were followed up for 27 527 person years (PY). Among the 506 patients who died, COD was unknown for 76 patients (15%) and common COD were TB (n = 71, 14%), Malignancies (n = 54, 10.7%) Meningitis (n = 39, 7.7%) and NCDs (n = 60, 11.9%). 49.4% of the deaths were within the first year of starting ART. Median age at death was 36 years (IQR:19-46). There was a near threefold increase in proportion of deaths due to NCDs and malignancies over the period of follow up. Low baseline CD4 cell count and WHO stages 3 & 4 were significant risk factors for all-cause mortality.TB remains the leading cause of death among HIV infected people. Deaths due to NCDs and malignancies increased over time. ART facilities need to incorporate management of NCDs including cancer as part of comprehensive care of PLHIV to reduce mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3080694336,"Objective To evaluate the 9-year incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) and cumulative adherence to perform a next test in a cohort of women aged 40+ years with no cervical screening cytology within a window of 5 years (underscreened women), after baseline cervical cytology and HPV tests. Methods In Catalonia, Spain, co-testing with cytology and HPV test has been recommended in the Public Health system since 2006 for underscreened women. In 2007, 1,594 women with underscreened criteria were identified and followed through medical records form Pathological Department. 9-year cumulative incidence of histologically confirmed CIN2+ and cumulative adherence to perform a next test were estimated using Kaplan-Meier statistics. Results Follow-up was available for 1,009 women (63.3%) resulting in 23 women with. CIN2+ (2.3%). Of them, 4 women (17%) had both tests negative at baseline (3CIN2 and 1CIN3) with cumulative incidence of CIN2+ of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.1–1.4) at 5-years and 1.3% (95% CI: 0.4–3.7) at 9-years. During the first year, the prevalence among women with both tests positive was 27.0% (95% CI: 13.0–50.6) for CIN2+. Lost to follow-up was higher among women with both tests negative compared to those with both positive tests (38.7% vs 4.2%, p-value <0.001). 40.5% of the women HPV-/cyto- had a re-screening test during the 4 years following the baseline, increasing until 53.5% during the 6 years of follow-up. Conclusions HPV detection shows a high longitudinal predictive value at 9-year to identify women at risk to develop CIN2+. The data validate a safe extension of the 3-year screening intervals (current screening interval) to 5-year intervals in underscreened women that had negative HPV result at baseline. It is necessary to establish mechanisms to ensure screening participation and adequate follow-up for these women."
https://openalex.org/W3080415091,"Factors regulating self-antigen directed immune-responses in autoimmunity are poorly understood. Signal regulatory protein gamma (SIRPγ) is a human T-cell specific protein with genetic variants associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). SIRPγ’s function in the immune system remains unclear. We show that T1D and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) subjects have significantly greater frequency of rs2281808 T genetic variant, that correlates with reduced SIRPγ-expression in T-cells. Importantly, reduced SIRPγ-expression in RRMS and T1D subjects was not restricted to T variant, suggesting SIRPγ-expression is also regulated by disease specific factors in autoimmunity. Interestingly, increased frequencies of SIRPγlow T-cells in RRMS and T1D positively correlated with proinflammatory molecules from T-cells. Finally, we show that SIRPγlow T-cells have enhanced pathogenecity in vivo in a GVHD model. These findings suggest that decreased-SIRPγ expression, either determined by genetic variants or through peripherally acquired processes, may have a mechanistic link to autoimmunity through induction of hyperactive T-cells."
https://openalex.org/W3080990858,"The recent literature reports promising results from using intelligent systems to support decision making in healthcare operations. Using these systems may lead to improved diagnostic and treatment protocols and to predict hospital bed demand. Predicting hospital bed demand in emergency department (ED) attendances could help resource allocation and reduce pressure on busy hospitals. However, there is still limited knowledge on whether intelligent systems can operate as fully autonomous, user-independent systems.Compare the performance of a computer-based algorithm and humans in predicting hospital bed demand (admissions and discharges) based on the initial SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) records of the ED.This was a retrospective cohort study that compared the performance of humans and machines in predicting hospital bed demand from an ED. It considered electronic medical records (EMR) of 9030 patients (230 used as a testing set, and hence evaluated both by humans and by an algorithm, and 8800 used as a training set exclusively by the algorithm) who visited the ED of a tertiary care and teaching public hospital located in Porto Alegre, Brazil between January and December 2014. The machine role was played by Support Vector Machine Classifier and the human prediction was performed by four ED physicians. Predictions were compared in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).All graders achieved similar accuracies. The accuracy by AUROC for the testing set was 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.77-0.87], 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75-0.85), 0.76 (95% CI: 0.71-0.81) for novice physicians, machine, experienced physicians, respectively. Processing time per test EMR was 0.00812±0.0009 seconds. In contrast, novice physicians took on average 156.80 seconds per test EMR, while experienced physicians took on average 56.40 seconds per test EMR.Our data indicated that the system could predict patient admission or discharge states with 80% accuracy, which was similar the performance of novice and experienced physicians. These results suggested that the algorithm could operate as an autonomous and independent system to complete this task."
https://openalex.org/W3015720579,"Eigenvector alignment, introduced herein to investigate human brain functional networks, is adapted from methods developed to detect influential nodes and communities in networked systems. It is used to identify differences in the brain networks of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) and healthy controls (HC). Well-established methods exist for analysing connectivity networks composed of brain regions, including the widespread use of centrality metrics such as eigenvector centrality. However, these metrics provide only limited information on the relationship between regions, with this understanding often sought by comparing the strength of pairwise functional connectivity. Our holistic approach, eigenvector alignment, considers the impact of all functional connectivity changes before assessing the strength of the functional relationship, i.e. alignment, between any two regions. This is achieved by comparing the placement of regions in a Euclidean space defined by the network’s dominant eigenvectors. Eigenvector alignment recognises the strength of bilateral connectivity in cortical areas of healthy control subjects, but also reveals degradation of this commissural system in those with AD. Surprisingly little structural change is detected for key regions in the Default Mode Network, despite significant declines in the functional connectivity of these regions. In contrast, regions in the auditory cortex display significant alignment changes that begin in aMCI and are the most prominent structural changes for those with AD. Alignment differences between aMCI and AD subjects are detected, including notable changes to the hippocampal regions. These findings suggest eigenvector alignment can play a complementary role, alongside established network analytic approaches, to capture how the brain’s functional networks develop and adapt when challenged by disease processes such as AD."
https://openalex.org/W3080314162,"The first phase of the published OPAL-HK study was a single-group treatment phase, which showed that patiromer normalised serum potassium at 4weeks in patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3-4 who were receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors. We utilised real-world data to provide a control comparison to evaluate patiromer's efficacy in lowering serum potassium.The Salford Kidney Study (SKS) in the United Kingdom provided a matched cohort. After applying OPAL-HK inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients with an outpatient potassium level between 5.1mmol/L to <6.5mmol/L and whose next outpatient level was checked 24-42 days later were selected. Patients underwent 1:1 matching with the 243 OPAL-HK patients using propensity matching based on 6 variables: age, gender, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, heart failure and potassium level. The study outcomes aligned with the OPAL-HK treatment phase: mean change in baseline potassium, and the proportion of patients with a potassium of 3.8 to <5.1mmol/L at follow-up.The study comprised 87 precisely matched patients. The mean follow-up in the 87 SKS patients was 31±5 days. At baseline, matched patients had a mean potassium of 5.5±0.3mmol/L. At follow-up, the mean level was unchanged in SKS patients but was 4.5±0.5mmol/L in the OPAL-HK group (p<0.001), a mean (±SE) change of -1.00±0.06mmol/L. The target range of 3.8 to <5.1mmol/L was reached in 80% of OPAL-HK patients compared with 0% in the SKS cohort. There were very few interventions undertaken to reduce hyperkalaemia in SKS patients.Using real-world data as a matched control arm for the first phase of the OPAL-HK study, we highlight a potential role for patiromer in lowering potassium levels in patients with CKD 3-4 receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors."

However, it is easily confused with imported T. chinensis and T. pseudommus because they have similar morphological characteristics. We identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers of T. rubripes by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and evaluated their ability to distinguish among T. rubripes, T. chinensis, and T. pseudommus. In all, 18 polymorphic SNPs were subjected to phylogenetic analyses of the three Takifugu species. Additionally, we subjected a second set of samples to Sanger sequencing to verify that the polymorphic SNPs could be used to evaluate the genetic variation among the three Takifugu species. A phylogenetic tree that included the analyzed sequence of set A, which is referred to as the reference sequence, and a validation sequence of set B with 18 SNPs were produced. Based on this phylogenetic tree and STRUCTURE analyses, T. rubripes, T. chinensis and T. pseudommus have low genetic variation and should be considered the same gene pool. Our findings suggest that further studies are needed to estimate the genetic association of the three Takifugu species."

We investigated women's recall of receiving counseling on pregnancy complications and how it affects health facility delivery in Bangladesh.Data from the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey was used for the study. After calculating the proportion of women who were informed about pregnancy complications during their last Antenatal Care (ANC) and the number of them who delivered in health facilities, Binary Logistic Regression was utilized in investigating chances of giving birth in health facilities among women who recalled they were told about pregnancy complications and those who were not told. The models were considered significant at 95%.A little above half of the women who were told about pregnancy complications during ANC delivered in health facilities (53.3%) and 43.6% of those who were not told delivered in health facilities. The findings revealed that women who were told about pregnancy complications during ANC were more likely to deliver at the health facility compared to those who were not told [COR = 1.56, CI = 1.31-1.87], and this persisted after controlling for the effect of covariates [AOR = 1.44, CI = 1.21-1.71].This study has stressed the importance of telling women about pregnancy complications during ANC by revealing that telling women about pregnancy complications during ANC is likely to result in health facility delivery. Health workers should intensify health education on pregnancy complications during ANC and motivate women to deliver in health facilities."

Andersen’s behavioral model of health service use is employed to identify the factors influencing their use. Claims data from January 1 to December 31, 2016 were extracted from both the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service and the automobile insurance screening center for all the medical treatments identified with the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale and Injury Severity Score. Using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service’s remote statistical analysis system, hierarchical regression and negative binomial analyses were conducted to determine the effect of predisposing, enabling, and need factors on health service use. The results demonstrate that the use of Korean health services is relatively equitable since medical expenses for trauma patients are greatly influenced by need factors. However, the length of time trauma patients stay in the hospital appears to differ according to insurance type. This study suggests that healthcare policies need to increase coverage benefits and improve medical billing for patients with severe trauma, as well as develop a more robust screening system for patients with mild to moderate impairments."
https://openalex.org/W3081022315,"Background The Republic of Ireland (ROI) has a low incidence of TB. A reform of TB services in 2003 recommended that the delivery of care to patients with TB should primarily be in the outpatient setting, with limited indications for hospitalization. Three hospitals were designated as TB centres. Our aim was to describe the utilization of hospital inpatient care by patients with TB in the ROI. Methods We searched public hospital coding data to identify discharges between 01/01/2015-31/12/18 where TB was the principal diagnosis. The cost of TB episodes of care was calculated using payment rules for public hospitals in the ROI. Results We identified 1185 discharges with TB as the principal diagnosis. Of these, 68% (801/1185) were emergency episodes of care and 32% (384/1185) were elective. We estimate that 65.1% (818/1257) patients with TB notified in the ROI from 2015 to 2018 who had an episode of care in a public hospital was 65.1% (818/1257) and that 50.8% (639/1257) of those notified had an emergency episode of care. The estimated mean annual cost of TB inpatient care per year in the ROI from 2015 to 2018 was €2,638,828–2,955,047, with emergency episodes of care having a mean annual cost of €2,250,926–2,557,397 per year. Conclusions The burden of TB on hospital inpatient care in the Republic of Ireland is significant."
https://openalex.org/W3081184171,"Although many novel phase I designs have been developed in recent years, few studies have discussed how to incorporate external information into dose-finding designs. In this paper, we first propose a new method for developing a phase I design, Bayesian optimal interval design (BOIN)[Liu S et al. (2015), Yuan Y et al. (2016)], for formally incorporating historical information. An algorithm to automatically generate parameters for prior set-up is introduced. Second, we propose a method to relax the fixed boundaries of the BOIN design to be adaptive, such that the accumulative information can be used more appropriately. This modified design is called adaptive BOIN (aBOIN). Simulation studies to examine performances of the aBOIN design in small and large sample sizes revealed comparable performances for the aBOIN and original BOIN designs for small sample sizes. However, aBOIN outperformed BOIN in moderate sample sizes. Simulation results also showed that when historical trials are conducted in settings similar to those for the current trial, their performance can be significantly improved. This approach can be applied directly to pediatric cancer trials, since all phase I trials in children are followed by similar efficient adult trials in the current drug development paradigm. However, when information is weak, operating characteristics are compromised."
https://openalex.org/W3081201573,"The efficiency of communication between animals is determined by the perception range of signals. With changes in the environment, signal transmission between a sender and a receiver can be influenced both directly, where the signal’s propagation quality itself is affected, and indirectly where the senders or receivers’ behaviour is impaired, impacting for example the distance between them. Here we investigated how meerkats (Suricata suricatta) in the Kalahari Desert adjust to these challenges in the context of maintaining group cohesion through contact calls. We found that meerkats changed their calling rate when signal transmission was affected indirectly due to increased dispersion of group members as during a drought, but not under typical wet conditions, when signal transmission was directly affected due to higher vegetation density. Instead under these wetter conditions, meerkats remained within proximity to each other. Overall, both direct and indirect environmental effects on signal perception resulted in an increased probability of groups splitting. In conclusion, we provide evidence that social animals can flexibly adjust their vocal coordination behaviour to cope with direct and indirect effects of the environment on signal perception, but these adjustments have limitations."
