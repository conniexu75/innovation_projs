What lies behind the rapid actions of ketamine? Li et al. (p. 959 ; see the Perspective by Cryan and O'Leary ) found that ketamine administration resulted in fast activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and increased levels of synaptic proteins in the rat prefrontal cortex. Ketamine rapidly increased the density and function of the dendritic spines of layer V pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, the behavioral actions of ketamine in models of depression and antidepressant response are dependent on mTOR signaling."

Zhao and Running (p. 940 ) used satellite data to estimate global terrestrial NPP over the past decade and found that the earlier trend has been reversed and that NPP has been decreasing. Combining this result with climate change data suggests that large-scale droughts are responsible for the decline. Future widespread droughts caused by global warming may thus further weaken the terrestrial carbon sink."

However, the emitted light tends to be omnidirectional, which limits applications that require accurate transmission between sender and receiver. Curto et al. (p. 930 ; see the Perspective by Giessen and Lippitz ) have designed an optical antenna, a shrunk-down version of the Yagi-Uda design used in microwave and radio communication, and show that coupling the quantum dot to the antenna provides control over the direction of the emitted light."

A key feature of cachexia is the progressive depletion of skeletal muscle mass, which occurs in concert with the loss of body fat. Muscle wasting dramatically reduces the quality of life but also appears to correlate with fatal outcomes. The mechanism by which cancers provoke the loss of the host's muscle mass is presently thought to be multifactorial. Various hormones, cytokines and tumor-derived factors have been shown to influence muscle protein balance in normal and disease states, through several major intracellular signal transduction systems. While activation of the AKT pathway is associated with muscle growth, in atrophying muscles there is an activation of FOXO as well as NF-κB and possibly also Smad transcription factors, which promote protein degradation (Glass, 2005Glass D.J.

FOXO3 by itself induces a set of atrophy-related genes, especially the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, which promotes breakdown of myofibrillar apparatus, and genes for autophagy (Cohen et al., 2009Cohen S.

However, it remains unclear which of these signaling systems plays a dominant role in the pathogenesis of cancer-associated muscle loss. ActRIIB is a high affinity activin type 2 receptor and mediates the signaling by a subset of TGF-β family ligands including myostatin, activin, GDF11 and others (Lee and McPherron, 2001Lee S.J.

Expression of a dominant negative ActRIIB in transgenic mice results in skeletal muscle hypertrophy, suggesting an important role of ActRIIB pathway in limiting muscle growth (Lee and McPherron, 2001Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Regulation of myostatin activity and muscle growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Myostatin null mutations also lead to skeletal muscle hypertrophy in multiple species including humans, whereas forced myostatin overexpression in adult mice leads to systemic muscle wasting (Schuelke et al., 2004Schuelke M.

In addition, in inhibin-deficient mice, activins are deregulated, leading to gonadal tumors and marked cachexia (Matzuk et al., 1994Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Mather J.P. Krummen L. Lu H. Bradley A.

Therefore, ActRIIB ligands appear critical in regulating muscle mass (Lee et al., 2005Lee S.J. Reed L.A. Davies M.V. Girgenrath S. Goad M.E. Tomkinson K.N. Wright J.F. Barker C. Ehrmantraut G.

In these investigations we set out (1) to examine in animal models of cancer cachexia the possible therapeutic impact of blocking ActRIIB pathway on muscle wasting and survival, and (2) to define the mechanisms by which ActRIIB pathway may modify the course of cancer cachexia. To antagonize the ActRIIB pathway activity, we have administered an ActRIIB decoy receptor referred to as sActRIIB in multiple cancer cachexia models, including the colon 26 (C26) tumor-bearing mice and inhibin-deficient mice, as well as nude mice bearing human G361 melanoma and TOV-21G ovarian carcinoma xenografts. Bearing tumors of distinctly different origins, these models mimic human cancer cachexia with a promounced loss of muscle mass at low tumor burden and display a dramatic wasting that is eventually lethal (Matzuk et al., 1994Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Mather J.P. Krummen L. Lu H. Bradley A. Development of cancer cachexia-like syndrome and adrenal tumors in inhibin-deficient mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Experimental cancer cachexia induced by transplantable colon 26 adenocarcinoma in mice.Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2290-2295PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that sActRIIB not only prevents further wasting, but also fully reverses skeletal muscle loss and atrophy of the heart, thereby dramatically prolonging survival of the tumor-bearing animals. Importantly, in the C26 model, these marked effects are seen even without any effect on tumor growth, adiposity, or levels of inflammatory cytokines. Our data reveal that ActRIIB antagonism reverses wasting by blocking the activation of muscle protein breakdown and stimulating muscle stem cell growth. Thus, ActRIIB pathway inhibition appears to have therapeutic potential for treating various types of muscle wasting, especially cancer cachexia. We measured the ligand-neutralizing activities of recombinant sActRIIB using C2C12 myoblasts stably transfected with a luciferase reporter for Smad2/3 signaling, as detailed in Experimental Procedures. sActRIIB potently inhibited both myostatin- and activin-mediated Smad2/3 signal transduction with IC50 values around 1.1 nM against myostatin and 3.6 nM against activin A (Figure S1A available online). The half-life (T1/2) of sActRIIB in mice was longer than 10 days. Administration of of a single dose of sActRIIB to adult C57Bl/6 mice led to dose-dependent increases in body weight and lean body mass (Figure S1B). The C26 tumor implanted mice manifested a lethal wasting syndrome characterized by progressive weight loss and death (Tanaka et al., 1990Tanaka Y. Eda H. Tanaka T. Udagawa T. Ishikawa T. Horii I. Ishitsuka H. Kataoka T. Taguchi T. Experimental cancer cachexia induced by transplantable colon 26 adenocarcinoma in mice.Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2290-2295PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1A , weight loss in these tumor-bearing mice began around day 5 after implantation, and within 2–3 weeks of implantation, their body weights declined by > 20%. Analysis of individual body weight changes indicates that when the tumor-free body weight decreased by > 25% after the tumor implantation (i.e., by > 35% compared to the normal control mice), deaths occurred (Figure S2). We administered sActRIIB to this model at different stages of cachexia and analyzed the changes in body weights and survival rates. When administration was begun when weight loss first became evident, weekly injection of sActRIIB not only completely prevented further weight loss, but even caused a rapid gain in body weight which soon exceeded that in non-implanted control mice (Figure 1A). Furthermore, when treatment was initiated during advanced cachexia, when more than 10% body weight was lost, the sActRIIB treatment rapidly and fully reversed the weight loss back to weights of normal control mice (Figure 1B). Remarkably, the gains in body weight were associated with a profound prolongation of survival in the tumor-bearing animals (p < 0.0001) (Figures 1A and 1B). Thus, regardless of the timing of the first dose during the course of cachexia, sActRIIB was able to reverse weight loss completely and to prolong animal survival dramatically.Figure S2Changes in Mean and Individual Body Weights in Normal and C26 Tumor-Bearing Mice, Related to Figure 1Show full captionBody weights of C26 tumor-bearing mice and normal control mice were recorded longitudinally after implantation.

The average body weight changes (A) and individual body weight changes (B) are shown. Note that the desending n values for C26 group in (A) reflect the progressive death of C26 tumor-bearing mice. Body composition analysis further demonstrated that sActRIIB completely blocked the loss of lean body mass, but surprisingly did not inhibit the decrease in fat mass in the C26 mice (Figure 2A ). The weights of extensor digitalis longus (EDL), soleus, calf and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in the untreated C26 mice decreased by more than 25% below levels in normal controls. However, the weights of all these muscles in sActRIIB-treated C26 mice were similar to or even greater than those in controls. Thus, the treatment fully protected the fast-twitch (EDL), slow-twitch (soleus) and mixed-fiber (calf and TA) muscles against cancer-associated atrophy (Figure 2A). Furthermore, the grip strength of the untreated C26 mice declined in parallel with the muscle weights. However, the sActRIIB treatment completely restored grip strength to above the normal levels (Figure 2B). Thus, the sActRIIB treatment caused a buildup of functional muscle in the tumor-bearing animals to levels resembling or exceeding control levels. To monitor possible effects of sActRIIB on growth of the C26 tumor, we measured tumor sizes and weights. As shown in Figure 2C, sActRIIB treatment had no effect on C26 tumor growth rate or weight. Thus, the dramatic muscle sparing is clearly not due to elimination of the primary tumor. Also, because neither fat mass nor tumor growth was affected by the treatment, the prolongation of survival in the C26 mice must be attributable to the large muscle sparing effect of sActRIIB. Therefore, sActRIIB was able to extend the survival by reversing cachexia even without inhibiting tumor growth. Northern blot analysis of the gastrocnemius muscles of C26-bearing mice revealed that myostatin mRNA level increased by more than 2-fold over control level, but sActRIIB treatment prevented this induction of myostatin (Figure 2D). However, no change in activin A (βA) mRNA level was detected in the gastrocnemius (data not shown). This induction of myostatin in muscle apparently was triggered by humoral mediator(s) either secreted by the C26 tumor, which was implanted subcutaneously, or released by the host in response to the tumor burden. Because sActRIIB treatment fully abolished the myostatin overexpression, activation of ActRIIB pathway must be critical for its induction. It is widely believed that proinflammatory cytokines are critical in the development of cancer cachexia (Argiles and Lopez-Soriano, 1999Argiles J.M. Lopez-Soriano F.J. The role of cytokines in cancer cachexia.Med. Res. Rev. 1999; 19: 223-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To test whether sActRIIB treatment might be achieving its anti-cachexia effect by attenuating proinflammatory cytokines, we measured by ELISA the serum levels of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in the C26 mice. As reported previously, these major cytokines, especially IL-6, were elevated in the circulation in C26 mice (Strassmann et al., 1992Strassmann G. Fong M. Kenney J.S. Jacob C.O. Evidence for the involvement of interleukin 6 in experimental cancer cachexia.J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1681-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, Tanaka et al., 1993Tanaka M. Miyazaki H. Takeda Y. Takeo S. Detection of serum cytokine levels in experimental cancer cachexia of colon 26 adenocarcinoma-bearing mice.Cancer Lett. 1993; 72: 65-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the sActRIIB treatment did not change the levels of these cytokines (Figure 2E), and thus they cannot account for the reversal of cachexia seen upon sActRIIB treatment. These findings imply that increased levels of IL-6 by itself can not induce the cachectic syndrome. To test this conclusion, we treated normal adult mice with a pharmacological dose of recombinant IL-6 by continuous infusion, but found no significant change in either body weight or muscle mass (Table S1). Thus, in the C26 model, ligands of the ActRIIB pathway appear to be more important than proinflammatory cytokines in triggering muscle wasting and cachexia. To examine whether ActRIIB pathway blockade is also effective in reversing muscle wasting induced by other cancers, we administered sActRIIB to inhibin-α knockout (KO) mice, which spontaneously form gonadal tumors and manifest marked cachexia (Matzuk et al., 1994Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Mather J.P. Krummen L. Lu H. Bradley A. Development of cancer cachexia-like syndrome and adrenal tumors in inhibin-deficient mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 8817-8821Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). It has been reported that genetic crossing of inhibin-α KO mice with follistatin transgenic or ActRII (ActRIIA) KO mice slows both tumor formation and development of weight loss (Cipriano et al., 2000Cipriano S.C. Chen L. Kumar T.R. Matzuk M.M. Follistatin is a modulator of gonadal tumor progression and the activin-induced wasting syndrome in inhibin-deficient mice.Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2319-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Coerver et al., 1996Coerver K.A. Woodruff T.K. Finegold M.J. Mather J. Bradley A. Matzuk M.M. Activin signaling through activin receptor type II causes the cachexia-like symptoms in inhibin-deficient mice.Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 534-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, administration of ActRIIA-Fc (a soluble receptor different from the sActRIIB studied here) to 3-week-old inhibin-deficient mice (when neither cachexia nor tumor was evident) had similar beneficial effects on body weight and tumor growth (Li et al., 2007Li Q. Kumar R. Underwood K. O'Connor A.E. Loveland K.L. Seehra J.S. Matzuk M.M. Prevention of cachexia-like syndrome development and reduction of tumor progression in inhibin-deficient mice following administration of a chimeric activin receptor type II-murine Fc protein.Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2007; 13: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, blocking deregulated activins before disease onset in inhibin-deficient mice slowed the development of tumor cachexia. However, it is unclear whether inhibiting activins after tumors and weight loss have fully developed in these mice could have any beneficial effect on tumor growth, cachexia, or both. This question is of therapeutic importance, since cachexia is generally found in patients with advanced cancers. Also, none of these studies examined muscle wasting, the most debilitating aspect of cachexia. Here, we administered sActRIIB to the inhibin-α KO mice after tumor cachexia had advanced to a late stage and analyzed the effects on muscle wasting, anorexia and survival. By 8 weeks of age, the weights of the male and female inhibin-α KO mice were 10%–17% lower than those of age-matched wild-type (WT) controls. We initially administered sActRIIB to the KO mice at 8 weeks of age. The WT mice grew steadily while the untreated KO mice of both sexes suffered dramatic weight loss, and nearly all died within a 10-week period (Figure 3A ). It should be noted that the plot of the weights of the surviving KO mice against time (Figure 3A) underestimates the actual weight loss of the inidividual untreated KO mice, because those animals showing greatest weight loss died sooner and thus steadily dropped out from the plots of mean body weights. In fact, individual body weight analysis indicates that at death, the untreated KO mice had lost an average of 24% (p < 0.001) of their initial body weights (i.e., at 8 weeks of age), and their mean muscle mass diminished to less than 50% of that of WT control (p < 0.001) (Figure S3A ). However, within one week of treatment with sActRIIB, the body weights of both male and female KO mice increased rapidly and reached levels in the WT littermates. With continued sActRIIB treatment, their body weights even exceeded the WT controls (Figure 3A). Remarkably, along with the body weight improvement, a dramatic prolongation in survival was observed in the sActRIIB-treated KO mice (p < 0.0001). In fact, when 100% of the untreated male and female KO mice had died, nearly all the treated males and 85% of the treated females were still alive (Figure 3A).Figure S3Additional Data from Inhibin-α KO mice, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Changes in individual body weights and terminal muscle mass in male WT and inhibin-α KO mice.

Student's t test; n = 10. (C) Effect of a single dose of sActRIIB on body weight, food intake, lean body mass, fat mass and calf muscle mass in female inhibin-α KO mice. 12-week-old female KO mice were treated for 2 weeks with a single subcutaneous injection of sActRIIB (30 mg/kg, SC) or PBS. As baseline control, age-matched WT littermates received a single injection of PBS. Values are means ± SEM. ∗p < 0.01, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, Student's t test. n = 10. (D) Effect of a single dose of sActRIIB on the terminal gonadal tumor weights in male and female inhibin-α KO mice. 8-week-old male and 12-week-old female KO mice were treated with a single subcutaneous injection of sActRIIB (30 mg/kg). As controls, age- and sex-matched WT littermates received a single injection of PBS. Two weeks after the single dose, the weight of testes or ovariaies (both the left and right for each mouse) was determined. Values are means ± SEM. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, Student's t test. n = 28/group for males; n = 20/group for females. To test the ability of sActRIIB to reverse muscle loss and cachexia-anorexia syndrome, we then administered a single dose to 8-week-old male and 12-week-old female KO mice. By these ages, gonadal tumors and cachexia had developed to an advanced stage in these KO mice with the animals loosing about 22%–28% of their muscle mass compared to their WT controls (Figure S3B). We analyzed the mice 14 days after the single dose. In the absence of sActRIIB treatment, body weights, food intake, lean body mass, fat mass, and mass of the gastrocnemius in the male and female KO mice were 20%–45% lower than those in the WT controls (Figure 3B and Figure S3C). However, sActRIIB treatment rapidly reversed all these parameters back to or even beyond the levels in the WT controls. Notably, a single injection of sActRIIB was able to cause the doubling of the mass of gastrocnemius muscle in the KO mice within two weeks (Figure 3B). To determine how these ActRIIB pathway perturbations affect muscle function, we analyzed the myosin heavy chain contents as well as muscle grip strength in the inhibin-α KO mice. As shown by western blot analysis, the content of myosin heavy chain in the gastrocnemius was lower in the untreated KO mice than in WT controls, but after sActRIIB treatment, it was increased to an even higher level than in the WT (Figure 3C). Concomitantly, sActRIIB treatment fully restored the weakened grip strength to above normal control levels (Figure 3D). Thus, sActRIIB promoted"

Elevated temperatures increase the rate of diffusion of metal atoms over the support, and larger, less reactive particles grow at the expense of smaller ones. Some supports that contain reducible metals, such as cerium oxide, tend to resist sintering better than oxides such as alumina. Farmer and Campbell (p. 933 ) present an analysis of previous calorimetry data for silver nanoparticles on magnesium oxides and cerium oxide surfaces and show that nanoparticles smaller than 1000 atoms are bound much more strongly to reduced cerium oxide. The energetic driving force for creating larger particles is quite low on these surfaces and increases the lifetime of smaller particles."

Its setting at the bottom of the sea floor posed an unanticipated risk as substantial amounts of hydrocarbons leaked into the deepwater column. Three separate cruises identified and sampled deep underwater hydrocarbon plumes that existed in May and June, 2010—before the well head was ultimately sealed. Camilli et al. (p. 201 ; published online 19 August) used an automated underwater vehicle to assess the dimensions of a stabilized, diffuse underwater plume of oil that was 22 miles long and estimated the daily quantity of oil released from the well, based on the concentration and dimensions of the plume. Hazen et al. (p. 204 ; published online 26 August) also observed an underwater plume at the same depth and found that hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were enriched in the plume and were breaking down some parts of the oil. Finally, Valentine et al. (p. 208 ; published online 16 September) found that natural gas, including propane and ethane, were also present in hydrocarbon plumes. These gases were broken down quickly by bacteria, but primed the system for biodegradation of larger hydrocarbons, including those comprising the leaking crude oil. Differences were observed in dissolved oxygen levels in the plumes (a proxy for bacterial respiration), which may reflect differences in the location of sampling or the aging of the plumes."
https://openalex.org/W2057742915,"Fungal Defenses One of the major driving forces of evolution is the constant arms race between plants and animals and the microbial pathogens that infect them. The fungus Cladosporium fulvum causes leaf mold on tomato plants. One of the ways tomato plants sense infections by C. fulvum is by detecting chitin, a component of fungal cell walls. In response, the fungus has evolved strategies to evade detection. De Jonge et al. (p. 953 ) have now identified one such mechanism in C. fulvum , mediated by the effector protein Ecp6. Secreted Ecp6 is able to bind to chitin oligosaccharides that are released upon degradation of the fungal cell wall and sequester them so that they are not detected by tomato chitin receptors. Proteins with domain structure similar to Ecp6 are conserved throughout the fungal kingdom, which suggests that chitin sequestration may represent a general mechanism used by fungi to evade immune detection."

In most patients, the disorder is associated with contraction of a D4Z4 microsatellite repeat array on chromosome 4q, but this contraction can also occur in the absence of disease, so the underlying genetic mechanisms have remained elusive. Lemmers et al. (p. 1650 , published online 19 August; see the Perspective by Mahadevan ) now show that FSHD patients carry sequence variants that create a canonical polyadenylation signal for transcripts derived from DUX4 , a homeobox gene straddling the last D4Z4 repeat unit and the adjacent sequence. Addition of poly(A) stabilizes the DUX4 transcript, which is likely to be a contributing factor in the disease."

Here, we show that i-proteasomes function to protect cell viability under conditions of IFN-induced oxidative stress.

We find that the ubiquitylation machinery is concomitantly upregulated in response to IFNs, functioning to target defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) for degradation by i-proteasomes. i-proteasome-deficiency in cells and in murine inflammation models results in the formation of aggresome-like induced structures and increased sensitivity to apoptosis. Efficient clearance of these aggregates by the enhanced proteolytic activity of the i-proteasome is important for the preservation of cell viability upon IFN-induced oxidative stress.

The central task of the 26S proteasome is the degradation of polyubiquitylated proteins formed by a cascade of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, which activate, conjugate, and transfer multiple ubiquitin (ub) moieties to protein substrates, targeting these for degradation. Substrates of proteasomes are short-lived regulatory proteins involved in cell differentiation, cell-cycle regulation, transcriptional regulation, or apoptosis (Kloetzel, 2001Kloetzel P.M. Antigen processing by the proteasome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2005Liu Y.C. Penninger J. Karin M. Immunity by ubiquitylation: a reversible process of modification.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The rapid elimination of proteins by the UPS is also of particular importance under stress conditions, such as heat shock or oxidative stress, that cause the production of misfolded or partially denatured proteins (Goldberg, 2003Goldberg A.L. Protein degradation and protection against misfolded or damaged proteins.Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The 20S proteasome, with its active site β subunits β1, β2, and β5, represents the central catalytic unit of the UPS and the catalytic core of the proteasome. The 20S catalytic core associates with 19S regulator complexes to form the 26S proteasome. In addition, the proteasome activator 28 (PA28) can interact with the 20S complex, forming 20S-PA28 or hybrid proteasomes (19S-20S-PA28) (Tanahashi et al., 2000Tanahashi N. Murakami Y. Minami Y. Shimbara N. Hendil K.B. Tanaka K. Hybrid proteasomes. Induction by interferon-gamma and contribution to ATP-dependent proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14336-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, specific catalytically active β subunits, i.e., β1i/LMP2, β2i/MECL1, and β5i/LMP7, are incorporated into nascent proteasome complexes upon interferon (IFN)-mediated induction to form an alternative proteasome composition (Kloetzel, 2001Kloetzel P.M. Antigen processing by the proteasome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Two of these subunits (β1i/LMP2, β5i/LMP7) are encoded within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II region, which led to the term immunosubunits (i-subunits) and immunoproteasome (i-proteasome) (Aki et al., 1994Aki M. Shimbara N. Takashina M. Akiyama K. Kagawa S. Tamura T. Tanahashi N. Yoshimura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Interferon-gamma induces different subunit organizations and functional diversity of proteasomes.J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Together, these findings connected i-proteasome function with antigen presentation. Proteasomes are responsible for the generation of peptides derived from pathogens or cellular proteins that are presented by MHC class I molecules on the cell surface to cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) (Yewdell, 2005Yewdell J.W. The seven dirty little secrets of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen processing.Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). i-proteasomes exhibit altered peptidase activities and cleavage site preferences that result in more efficient liberation of many MHC class I epitopes (Kloetzel and Ossendorp, 2004Kloetzel P.M.

Newly translated polypeptides, a large pool of which are ubiquitylated, represent an important source for MHC class I epitopes (Reits et al., 2000Reits E.A. Vos J.C. Grommé M. Neefjes J. The major substrates for TAP in vivo are derived from newly synthesized proteins.Nature. 2000; 404: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, Schubert et al., 2000Schubert U. Antón L.C.

It thus was proposed that this pool is mostly composed of defective proteins, and hence these proteins were called defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). The DRiP hypothesis, linking antigen processing to translation, would guarantee that the cellular immune system has access to its substrates before they reach their final destination within or outside the cell (Lelouard et al., 2004Lelouard H. Ferrand V. Marguet D. Bania J. Camosseto V. David A. Gatti E. Pierre P.

The seven dirty little secrets of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen processing.Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the idea that a large amount of newly translated proteins should be misfolded or harbor translational errors raised some doubts with regard to the validity of the hypothesis (Vabulas and Hartl, 2005Vabulas R.M. Hartl F.U. Protein synthesis upon acute nutrient restriction relies on proteasome function.Science. 2005; 310: 1960-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, Yewdell and Nicchitta, 2006Yewdell J.W.

Cells rapidly shift to i-proteasome formation in response to proinflammatory cytokines produced by the innate immune system early upon infection. i-proteasome formation is a strongly accelerated and transient response (Heink et al., 2005Heink S. Ludwig D. Kloetzel P.M. Krüger E. IFN-gamma-induced immune adaptation of the proteasome system is an accelerated and transient response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 9241-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), implying an urgent and timely need for their function. However, the absence of fully functional i-proteasomes in mice did not generally reveal effects on T cell priming or on the hierarchy of known T cell epitopes (Nussbaum et al., 2005Nussbaum A.K. Rodriguez-Carreno M.P. Benning N. Botten J. Whitton J.L. Immunoproteasome-deficient mice mount largely normal CD8+ T cell responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection and DNA vaccination.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, in pathogen-challenged tissues, noninfected cells also induce i-proteasome formation in response to cytokines without the need for improved antigen processing (Yewdell, 2005Yewdell J.W. The seven dirty little secrets of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen processing.Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that i-proteasomes must have important non-antigen-processing functions (Nussbaum et al., 2005Nussbaum A.K. Rodriguez-Carreno M.P. Benning N. Botten J. Whitton J.L. Immunoproteasome-deficient mice mount largely normal CD8+ T cell responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection and DNA vaccination.J.

The seven dirty little secrets of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen processing.Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). i-proteasome function has been mainly associated with antigen processing and MHC class I antigen presentation. Here, we show that a major function of the i-proteasome is the maintenance of protein homeostasis and the preservation of cell viability under cytokine-induced oxidative stress. Because IFNs enhance proteasome-dependent antigen presentation efficiency (Kloetzel, 2001Kloetzel P.M. Antigen processing by the proteasome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), we reasoned that IFNs may also enhance the pool of poly-ub conjugates. To test this assumption, we stimulated cells with IFN-γ (Figure 1A and Figure S1C available online), -α, or -β (Figures S1A and S1B). Monitoring of the total amount of poly-ub conjugates over time revealed a significant enrichment of poly-ub conjugates between 4 and 12 hr after IFN stimulation (Figure 1B and Figure S1). This enrichment appeared to be a transient response because the levels of detectable poly-ub conjugates initially increased and the amount of poly-ub conjugates returned to reduced levels between 24 and 48 hr of IFN stimulation. The accumulation of poly-ub conjugates was independent of the cell type and the type of IFN used and was detectable in both mouse and human cells (Figures 1A and 1B and Figure S1). Concomitant with the induction of i-proteasomes, as determined by increased β5i/LMP7 levels, the amount of poly-ub conjugates gradually declined (Figures 1A and 1B and Figure S1). The strong decrease in poly-ub conjugates after 48 hr was due to enhanced proteasome-dependent protein turnover because the poly-ub conjugates were stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin (Figure 1C and Figure S1E). Previously, it was shown that the rate-limiting pool of free ub can be compensated by depletion of ubiquitylated histone H2A (ubH2A) (Dantuma et al., 2006Dantuma N.P. Groothuis T.A. Salomons F.A. Neefjes J. A dynamic ubiquitin equilibrium couples proteasomal activity to chromatin remodeling.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Indeed, at time points displaying strongly enriched levels of ub conjugates in response to IFN-γ, we observed decreased levels of ubH2A, and slightly decreased free ub levels (Figure 1A and Figure S1C). The functional role of ubiquitylation and thus the fate of the modified proteins largely depend on the type of linkage between the ub moieties within a poly-ub chain (Mukhopadhyay and Riezman, 2007Mukhopadhyay D. Riezman H. Proteasome-independent functions of ubiquitin in endocytosis and signaling.Science. 2007; 315: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). To study which type of poly-ub conjugates was induced in IFN-γ-treated cells, we performed in vitro ub conjugation assays using modified forms of epitope-tagged ub. Substitution of the K48 residue by arginine (R) almost completely abrogated the formation of poly-ub conjugates, demonstrating that IFN-γ preferentially stimulated the synthesis of poly-ub chains with K48 linkages (Figure 1D), targeting these ub conjugates for degradation. The inhibitory effect of the K48R ub mutant on IFN-γ stimulated ub conjugation was observed despite the presence of other functional K residues. Thus, other K residues within the ub molecule do not significantly contribute to IFN-γ-induced polyubiquitylation. A slight stimulation of K63 poly-ub chains by IFN-γ is negligible, because the IFN-induced ub conjugation can be completely restored using the K63R ub mutant containing a functional K48 residue (Figure 1D).Figure S1Enhanced Accumulation of Poly-Ub Conjugates Is Caused by Type I and Type II IFN, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) Murine fibroblasts (A) or human HeLa cells (B) were stimulated with IFN-α or IFN-β for up to 48 hr.

(F) Enhanced translation activity was determined by an increase of the phosphorylated form of ribosomal S6 subunit after 2h IFN-γ stimulation in HeLa cells. β-tubulin served as a loading control. As expected, IFN-γ treatment induced translation via the mTOR pathway (Kaur et al., 2008Kaur S. Sassano A. Dolniak B. Joshi S. Majchrzak-Kita B. Baker D.P. Hay N. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Role of the Akt pathway in mRNA translation of interferon-stimulated genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). After 2 hr of IFN stimulation, we detected increased levels of the phosphorylated ribosomal S6 subunit, a marker for increased translational activity (Figure S1F). To determine whether the accumulated poly-ub conjugates derive from newly synthesized proteins, we pulse-labeled IFN-γ-treated cells and immunoprecipitated ub-modified proteins. IFN-γ induced a strong increase in the amount of poly-ub conjugates (Figure 1E, “0 CHX”) suggesting that primarily newly translated proteins shape the pool of poly-ub substrates in response to IFN-γ. In support, cycloheximide chase experiments demonstrated that the increase in poly-ub protein levels was strongly dependent on translation (Figure 1E). Thus, the enhanced polyubiquitylation of newly synthesized proteins in response to IFN-γ is accompanied by augmented de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, the same experiments also revealed that poly-ub proteins are degraded significantly faster in IFN-γ-treated than in untreated cells (see also Figure 4). To determine whether the accumulation of poly-ub conjugates is the result of IFN-induced enhanced polyubiquitylation activity, we performed in vitro ubiquitylation experiments with cellular lysates of IFN-γ-stimulated cells. Enhanced polyubiquitylation activity was detected already at early time points and did not significantly decrease over the time period analyzed (Figure 2A ). This prompted us to study whether IFNs also exert a more general effect on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Therefore, we investigated the expression of UPS-related messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in response to IFN-γ in a focused microarray approach. IFNs specifically induced 20 E3 ub ligases. Of the E2 ub-conjugating enzymes, only UBE2L6 was strongly induced (Table S1), and its mRNA was upregulated more than 50-fold in response to 4 hr of IFN treatment (Figure 2B and Figure S2). To study the role of UBE2L6 in IFN-induced ub conjugation, we silenced expression of UBE2L6 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) to interfere with the thioester cascade. Depletion of UBE2L6 significantly abolished the increase in total poly-ub conjugates 8 hr after IFN-γ stimulation, whereas no differences could be detected in untreated cells (Figure 2C). Thus, UBE2L6-dependent ub conjugation activity plays an important role in accumulation of ub conjugates during the early IFN response. Together, our experiments demonstrate that increased levels of polyubiquitylated proteins in response to IFNs are at least in part the result of augmented ub conjugation activity.Figure S2Upregulation of UBE2L6 in Response to Type I and Type II IFN, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Real-time RT-PCR analysis (A) and immunoblot (B) were performed to illustrate UBE2L6 expression in HeLa cells induced by IFN-α and IFN-β.

In addition to enhanced ubiquitylation activity, a cytokine-dependent partial impairment of proteasomal degradation capacity may also explain the transient increase in cellular levels of poly-ub conjugates. Therefore, we assayed the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) peptide-hydrolyzing activity in total cell lysates of IFN-γ-treated HeLa cells (Figure 3A ). Indeed, IFN stimulation resulted in a transient decrease of proteasomal CT-L activity 4–12 hr after induction, which was restored and even augmented after 24–48 hr. This result was confirmed by measurement of in-gel CT-L activity in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and could be assigned to 26S and to PA28-associated proteasome pools (Figures 3B–3D and Figures S3D and S3E ).Figure S3Cellular Proteasome Pools in Response to IFN-γ, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Proteasomes were precipitated from glycerol gradient fractions of HeLa cells exposed to IFN-γ.

Concomitant with the decreased proteolytic activity between 8 and 12 hr, we detected transiently lower 26S proteasome levels in response to IFN-γ (Figure 3C). To define this phenomenon in more detail, we immunoprecipitated proteasomes from glycerol gradient fractions enriched for 26S complexes, and immunodetection of the 19S regulator subunit Rpn2 followed. In agreement with the measured decrease in proteolytic activity, we observed a transiently reduced association of 19S regulators with 20S complexes (Figure 3E). Total amounts of 20S complexes, as monitored by the α4 subunit levels, remained unchanged, suggesting that IFN-γ induces a transient dissociation of the 20S complexes from the 19S regulator. Next, we studied the kinetics of 26S i-proteasome formation by incorporation of the β1i/LMP2 subunit into the complexes by using native PAGE (Figure 3F). In agreement with the increase in proteasomal activity after 24 hr of IFN-γ exposure, i26S proteasome levels were strongly enhanced at this time point. Reorganization of proteasomes upon IFN exposure was also shown by immunoprecipitation experiments or two-dimensional separation of purified 20S complexes (Figures S3A–S3C). Importantly, the time frames exhibiting the highest accumulation of poly-ub conjugates corresponded exactly with the decline of proteasomal peptidase activity and coincided with the time period required for the formation of i26S proteasomes. The above experiments suggest that i-proteasomes may be more efficient in degrading poly-ub substrates than standard proteasomes (s-proteasomes). We therefore examined the removal of poly-ub conjugates in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human cell lines (T1, T2) with either a fully functional i-proteasome (WT, T1) or cells deficient for one or two of the i-proteasomes subunits (LMP7−/−, T2) after IFN challenge (Figures 4A and 4B and Figure S4A ). Furthermore, to study the requirement of i-proteasomes for the degradation of IFN-γ induced poly-ub conjugates in vivo, we induced inflammation in WT mice and in i-proteasome-deficient mice by using lipopolysaccaride (LPS) and analyzed i-proteasome function in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Figures 4C and 4D).Figure S4i-Proteasomes Display Higher Proteolytic Activity, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Human T1 and T2 cells were treated with IFN-γ up to 48 hr.

However, nuclear movement to reorient the centrosome in migrating fibroblasts occurs through an unknown actin-dependent mechanism. We found that linear arrays of outer (nesprin2G) and inner (SUN2) nuclear membrane proteins assembled on and moved with retrogradely moving dorsal actin cables during nuclear movement in polarizing fibroblasts. Inhibition of nesprin2G, SUN2, or actin prevented nuclear movement and centrosome reorientation. The coupling of actin cables to the nuclear membrane for nuclear movement via specific membrane proteins indicates that, like plasma membrane integrins, nuclear membrane proteins assemble into actin-dependent arrays for force transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2088697466,"Recent studies showed that germ-free (GF) mice are resistant to obesity when consuming a high-fat, high-carbohydrate Western diet. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms are involved in the antiobesity phenotype and whether GF mice develop insulin resistance and dyslipidemia with high-fat (HF) feeding. In the present study, we compared the metabolic consequences of HF feeding on GF and conventional (conv) C57BL/6J mice. GF mice consumed fewer calories, excreted more fecal lipids, and weighed significantly less than conv mice. GF/HF animals also showed enhanced insulin sensitivity with improved glucose tolerance, reduced fasting and nonfasting insulinemia, and increased phospho-Akt((Ser-473)) in adipose tissue. In association with enhanced insulin sensitivity, GF/HF mice had reduced plasma TNF-α and total serum amyloid A concentrations. Reduced hypercholesterolemia, a moderate accretion of hepatic cholesterol, and an increase in fecal cholesterol excretion suggest an altered cholesterol metabolism in GF/HF mice. Pronounced nucleus SREBP2 proteins and up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes indicate that enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis contributed to the cholesterol homeostasis in GF/HF mice. Our results demonstrate that fewer calorie consumption and increased lipid excretion contributed to the obesity-resistant phenotype of GF/HF mice and reveal that insulin sensitivity and cholesterol metabolism are metabolic targets influenced by the gut microbiota."

https://openalex.org/W2084067121,"ATG12, an ubiquitin-like modifier required for macroautophagy, has a single known conjugation target, another autophagy regulator called ATG5. Here, we identify ATG3 as a substrate for ATG12 conjugation. ATG3 is the E2-like enzyme necessary for ATG8/LC3 lipidation during autophagy. ATG12-ATG3 complex formation requires ATG7 as the E1 enzyme and ATG3 autocatalytic activity as the E2, resulting in the covalent linkage of ATG12 onto a single lysine on ATG3. Surprisingly, disrupting ATG12 conjugation to ATG3 does not affect starvation-induced autophagy. Rather, the lack of ATG12-ATG3 complex formation produces an expansion in mitochondrial mass and inhibits cell death mediated by mitochondrial pathways. Overall, these results unveil a role for ATG12-ATG3 in mitochondrial homeostasis and implicate the ATG12 conjugation system in cellular functions distinct from the early steps of autophagosome formation."
https://openalex.org/W2013069561,"Apoptosis is a conserved cellular pathway that results in the activation of cysteine-aspartyl proteases, or caspases. To dissect the nonredundant roles of the executioner caspase-3, -6, and -7 in orchestrating apoptosis, we have developed an orthogonal protease to selectively activate each isoform in human cells. Our approach uses a split-tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease under small-molecule control, which we call the SNIPer, with caspase alleles containing genetically encoded TEV cleavage sites. These studies reveal that all three caspases are transiently activated but only activation of caspase-3 or -7 is sufficient to induce apoptosis. Proteomic analysis shown here and from others reveals that 20 of the 33 subunits of the 26S proteasome can be cut by caspases, and we demonstrate synergy between proteasome inhibition and dose-dependent caspase activation. We propose a model of proteolytic reciprocal negative regulation with mechanistic implications for the combined clinical use of proteasome inhibitors and proapoptotic drugs."

Crystallographic studies have shown how ligand binding induces dimerization of the EGFR extracellular region but cannot explain the ""high-affinity"" and ""low-affinity"" classes of cell-surface EGF-binding sites inferred from curved Scatchard plots. From a series of crystal structures of the Drosophila EGFR extracellular region, we show here how Scatchard plot curvature arises from negatively cooperative ligand binding. The first ligand-binding event induces formation of an asymmetric dimer with only one bound ligand. The unoccupied site in this dimer is structurally restrained, leading to reduced affinity for binding of the second ligand, and thus negative cooperativity. Our results explain the cell-surface binding characteristics of EGF receptors and suggest how individual EGFR ligands might stabilize distinct dimeric species with different signaling properties."

However, it is still unclear how translocation can drive removal of DNA-bound proteins, and basic properties like the elementary step size remain controversial. Using single-molecule fluorescence analysis on a prototypical superfamily 1 helicase, Bacillus stearothermophilus PcrA, we discovered that PcrA preferentially translocates on the DNA lagging strand instead of unwinding the template duplex. PcrA anchors itself to the template duplex using the 2B subdomain and reels in the lagging strand, extruding a single-stranded loop. Static disorder limited previous ensemble studies of a PcrA stepping mechanism. Here, highly repetitive looping revealed that PcrA translocates in uniform steps of 1 nt. This reeling-in activity requires the open conformation of PcrA and can rapidly dismantle a preformed RecA filament even at low PcrA concentrations, suggesting a mode of action for eliminating potentially deleterious recombination intermediates."

Numerical simulations from Palenzuela et al.

https://openalex.org/W2086274343,"The NAD rescue pathway consists of two enzymatic steps operated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases. Recently, the potent Nampt inhibitor FK866 has been identified and evaluated in clinical trials against cancer. Yet, how Nampt inhibition affects NAD contents and bioenergetics is in part obscure. It is also unknown whether NAD rescue takes place in mitochondria, and FK866 alters NAD homeostasis within the organelle. Here, we show that FK866-dependent reduction of the NAD contents is paralleled by a concomitant increase of ATP in various cell types, in keeping with ATP utilization for NAD resynthesis. We also show that poly- and mono(ADP-ribose) transferases rather than Sirt-1 are responsible for NAD depletion in HeLa cells exposed to FK866. Mass spectrometry reveals that the drug distributes in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartment. However, the cytoplasmic but not the mitochondrial NAD pool is reduced upon acute or chronic exposure to the drug. Accordingly, Nampt does not localize within the organelles and their bioenergetics is not affected by the drug. In the mouse, FK866-dependent reduction of NAD contents in various organs is prevented by inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases or the NAD precursor kynurenine. For the first time, our data indicate that mitochondria lack the canonical NAD rescue pathway, broadening current understanding of cellular bioenergetics."

We here examined the molecular mechanism by which CO regulates HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1)-dependent expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is an important angiogenic factor. We found that astrocytes stimulated with CORM-2 (CO-releasing molecule) promoted angiogenesis by increasing VEGF expression and secretion. CORM-2 also induced HO-1 (hemeoxygenase-1) expression and increased nuclear HIF-1α protein level, without altering its promoter activity and mRNA level. VEGF expression was inhibited by treatment with HIF-1α siRNA and a hemeoxygenase inhibitor, indicating that CO stimulates VEGF expression via up-regulation of HIF-1α protein level, which is partially associated with HO-1 induction. CORM-2 activated the translational regulatory proteins p70S6k and eIF-4E as well as phosphorylating their upstream signal mediators Akt and ERK. These translational signal events and HIF-1α protein level were suppressed by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), MEK, and mTOR, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways are involved in a translational increase in HIF-1α.

HIF-1α protein stability is also regulated in an oxygen-independent manner by the competitive binding of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), an ATPase-dependent molecular chaperone that controls folding, activation, and stabilization of several substrate proteins, including HIF-1α (20Kong X.

Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); however, the regulatory mechanism by which CO promotes HIF-1α activation has not been clearly elucidated at the molecular level. In this study, we investigated the effect of CO on HIF-1α protein level and VEGF expression as well as its molecular mechanism in astrocytes. We found that CO increases HIF-1α level by two distinct mechanisms, up-regulation of protein synthesis by activating the translational regulatory proteins p70 S6 kinase and eIF-4E through PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways and inhibition of HIF-1α degradation by promoting the interaction of HIF-1α with HSP90α. Thus, the CO-induced increase in HIF-1α protein level in astrocytes promoted the secretion of VEGF and the subsequent activation of adjacent and surrounding endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis. These results suggest that CO stimulates angiogenesis in a paracrine mode of action by increasing HIF-1α-mediated VEGF production in astrocytes via protein synthesis and stabilization of HIF-1α.

RuCl3, CORM-2 (CO-releasing molecule-2; (Ru(CO)3Cl2)2), hemin, actinomycin D (ActD), cycloheximide (CHx), deguelin, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) were purchased from Sigma. Sn(IV) protoporphyrin IX dichloride (SnPP) was purchased from Frontier Scientific. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from human umbilical cord veins by collagenase treatment as described previously (26Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar) and used in passages 3–8. HUVECs were grown in M199 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 3 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Millipore), and 10 units/ml heparin (Sigma). Primary human brain astrocytes dissociated from normal human brain cortex tissue were purchased from the Applied Cell Biology Research Institute (Kirkland, WA). Primary astrocytes were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone) and used in passages 5–9. For hypoxia experiments, cells were incubated in a hypoxic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI) that maintained the cells under low oxygen tension (5% CO2 with 1% O2, balanced with N2). The human HIF-1α (NM_001530) promoter (1202 bases) was produced by genomic PCR from human astrocyte cells. Primers used were 5′-CGGGGTACCTAGCTTGCAAAGTTGCCAAAGGCC-3′ (forward includes enzyme digestion sites for KpnI) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGTGAATCGGTCCCCGCGATG-3′ (reverse; for HindIII). The product was inserted into pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Astrocytes were transfected with a plasmid for pHIF-1α. Luciferase activity was assayed using the luciferase assay system (Promega). The relative luciferase units were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. HO enzyme activity in astrocyte microsomes was measured by bilirubin generation as described previously (27Balla G. Jacob H.S. Balla J. Rosenberg M. Nath K. Apple F. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human astrocytes were pretreated with or without 50 μm SnPP for 15 min, followed by treatment with DMSO or 100 μm CORM-2 for 8 h. The cells were detached using trypsin/EDTA and centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was suspended in MgCl2 (2 mm) phosphate (100 mm) buffer (pH 7.4), lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to a reaction mixture containing NADPH (0.8 mm), mouse liver cytosol (2 mg) as a source of biliverdin reductase, the substrate hemin (10 μm), glucose 6-phosphate (2 mm), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.2 units) in a final volume of 400 μl. The reaction was performed in the dark for 1 h at 37 °C, and the formed bilirubin was extracted with chloroform (400 μl) and calculated by the difference in absorbance between 464 and 530 nm using the extinction coefficient of 40 mm−1 cm−1 for bilirubin. HO activity is expressed as pmol of bilirubin formed/mg of protein/h. Astrocytes were transiently transfected with HO-1 vector (provided by Dr. Jozef Dulak, Jagiellonian University) or with pcDNA3.1/HIF-1α vector or pcDNA3.1/HIF-1α DM vector (provided by Dr. Gregg L. Semenza, The Johns Hopkins University) using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). All transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 48-h transfection, cells were collected. For preparation of conditioned medium (CM), cells were cultured with serum-free DMEM for different time periods, and CM was collected and concentrated through a centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Beverly, MA). Protein levels of CM were determined by Western blot analysis. For preparation of CM for endothelial cell migration, cells were cultured with M199 containing 5% FBS, and CM was collected and concentrated (3×) through a centrifugal filter device (3 kDa cut-off; Millipore). Human astrocytes were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed gently, blocked, and incubated with the HIF-1α primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor antibody (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained using DAPI (Molecular Probes). Images were obtained with a confocal microscope (Olympus FV300). Nuclear proteins were extracted as follows. Human astrocytes were incubated with RuCl3 or CORM-2 for 8 h and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped into buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA) and centrifuged briefly. The cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) containing 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the nuclear lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was obtained, and the protein concentrations were measured using a Coomassie Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Cellular proteins from transfected astrocytes and secreted proteins in conditioned medium were analyzed by Western blot. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (28Moon E.J. Jeong C.H. Jeong J.W. Kim K.R. Yu D.Y. Murakami S. Kim C.W. Kim K.W. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 382-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used antibodies specific for HIF-1α (BD Biosciences), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (EMD Chemicals, NJ), HO-1 (Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI), phospho-p70S6K, p70S6K, phospho-ERK, ERK, phospho-AKT, AKT, phospho-eIF-4E, eIF-4E (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), HSP90 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), VEGF (Thermo Scientific or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), ubiquitin (Invitrogen), or actin (Sigma). Cellular proteins from astrocytes were incubated with an antibody for HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals) or HSP90 (Stressgen or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in TEG buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100) with constant rotation overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation following incubation with protein G-Sepharose and washed three times with TEG buffer. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. Oligonucleotides of human HIF-1α-specific siRNAs and the control non-silencing RNA were designed by Dharmacon Inc. The sequence of human HIF-1α siRNA was 5′-CTGGACACAGTGTGTTTGA-3′. The human HO-1 siRNA was purchased from Sigma (sc-44306), and the human HSP90α siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (siGENOME SMART pool M-005186-02). Astrocytes were grown to 70% confluence, and siRNA was transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human astrocytes were lysed in HEB buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) containing protease inhibitor mixtures. [35S]Methionine-labeled VHL protein was synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation using pcDNA3.1/hygro-VHL plasmid, according to the instruction manual (Promega). GST-ODD (amino acids 401–603 of human HIF-1α) was purified from cell lysate of Escherichia coli transfected with pGEX-4T-1/HIF-1α-ODD plasmid. Resin-bound GST-ODD (200 μg of protein/∼80 μl of resin volume) was incubated in the presence of 2 mm ascorbic acid, 100 μm FeCl2, and 5 mm α-ketoglutarate with the indicated amounts of enzyme in 200 μl of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with mild agitation for 90 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was centrifuged and washed three times with 10 volumes of NETN buffer. Resin-bound GST-ODD was mixed with 10 μl of 35S-labeled VHL in 500 μl of EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After mild agitation at 4 °C for 2 h, the resin was washed three times with 1 ml of NETN buffer, and proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. The amount of each sample loaded was monitored by staining the GST-ODD with Coomassie Blue. Total RNAs were isolated from the indicated cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously (29Lee M.S. Moon E.J. Lee S.W. Kim M.S. Kim K.W. Kim Y.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3290-3293PubMed Google Scholar). The following sets of primers were used: 5′-AGTCGGACAGCCTCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCTGCCTTGTATAGGA-3′ (reverse) for human HIF-1α; 5′-CAGGCAGAGAATGCTGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTTCACATAGCGCTGCA-3′ (reverse) for human HO-1; 5′-GAGAATTCGGCCTCCGAAACCATGAACTTTCTGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGCATGCCCTCCTGCCCGGCTCACCGC-3′ (reverse) for VEGF; 5′-CAGGGCTGCTTTTAACTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAGAGGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′ (reverse) for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). PCR products were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gels, and the gels were digitally imaged (BioImaging System). Polysome analysis was performed as described previously (30Koritzinsky M. Wouters B.G. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 435: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Human astrocytes were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (0.3 m NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 200 units of Superase-In (Ambion, Foster City, CA)). After centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, heparin (a broad range RNase inhibitor) was added to the supernatant and made up to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. After debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, the cytoxolic supernatants were laid on a 20–50% sucrose gradient (total volume, 5 ml) and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 120 min in a Beckman SW-55Ti rotor at 4 °C. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected and monitored for absorbance at the 254-nm wavelength. Each absorbance was calculated by subtracting the absorbance from blank-containing lysis buffer laid on a sucrose gradient. For RNA isolation from fractions (1.2 ml), samples were precipitated with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol at −80 °C overnight and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. After precipitants were washed with 85% ethanol, pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) and precipitated by adding 4 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.3) and 100 μl of 100% ethanol. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) water, added to 100 μl of Tris-buffered phenol/chloroform, and mixed well. Samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the aqueous (upper) phase was transferred to a new tube. Then, lithium chloride (LiCl) was added to a final concentration of 2 m to remove heparin, a potent RT-PCR inhibitor. After incubation at −20 °C overnight and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, pellets were washed with 75% ethanol. Precipitants were resuspended in 20 μl of DEPC water and precipitated by adding 2 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.3) and 60 μl of 100% ethanol. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min and washed with 75% ethanol. After all ethanol was removed, samples were resuspended in 10 μl of DEPC water and analyzed by RT-PCR using HIF-1α and GAPDH primers. For a migration assay using the co-culture system, astrocytes were seeded on 24-well plates and cultured until reaching 90% confluence. Cells were pretreated with several chemical inhibitors for 30 min and incubated with 100 μm CORM-2 for 8 h. Media were removed and replaced with M199 containing 5% FBS for 20 h. The chemotactic motility of HUVECs was measured using Transwell plates (6.5-mm diameter, 8.0-μm pore size). The lower surface of the Transwell plates was coated with 10 μg of gelatin. HUVECs (1 × 105 cells) were loaded on the upper well. After a 4-h incubation, migrated cells were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Non-migrating cells on the upper surface of the well were removed by wiping with a cotton swab, and migratory cells were observed by using an inverted phase-contrast microscope. Quantification of protein band intensity obtained by Western blot was analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and normalized to the density of the actin or Coomassie staining band. All data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons between groups were done using Student's test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To evaluate whether human astrocytes exposed to CO affect angiogenesis of endothelial cells through a paracrine mechanism, in vitro angiogenesis assays were performed. CM from astrocytes treated with the CO-releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2) for 8 h significantly increased HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation (supplemental Fig. S1). Because VEGF is one of the most potent angiogenic factors known (24Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnürch H. Martinez R. Møller N.P. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar), the potential role of VEGF in CO-induced angiogenesis was explored. CM-induced increases in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation were significantly inhibited by treatment with a VEGF-neutralizing antibody but not by the addition of human IgG as a control (supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggest that paracrine-mediated angiogenic effects of CO-treated cells are derived from VEGF production. HIF-1α is necessary and sufficient for the hypoxia-induced expression of multiple angiogenic growth factors, including VEGF (13Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of CO on HIF-1α expression in human astrocytes. CORM-2 treatment significantly increased HIF-1α protein level in a time-dependent manner in comparison with the noncarbonyl inert control RuCl3, and maximal HIF-1α protein level was detected after 8 h of CORM-2 treatment (Fig. 1A). Exposure of astrocytes to concentrations of CORM-2 between 5 and 100 μm for 8 h resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in HIF-1α expression (Fig. 1B). We further examined whether ActD, a transcription inhibitor, had an effect on HIF-1α and VEGF mRNA levels. The HIF-1α mRNA level was not altered by treatment with CORM-2 alone or in combination with ActD. However, VEGF mRNA level was significantly increased in CORM-2-treated astrocytes, and this increase was blocked by co-treatment with ActD (Fig. 1C). We next examined whether CO regulates HIF-1α promoter activity. CORM-2 treatment did not affect HIF-1α promoter activity, compared with the solvent DMSO or negative control RuCl3 (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that CO promotes HIF-1α protein level without affecting transcriptional induction of HIF-1α and stimulates VEGF expression at the transcriptional step. HIF-1α is a well known transcription factor that easily translocates into the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of various genes, including VEGF (22Maxwell P.H. Dachs G.U. Gleadle J.M. Nicholls L.G. Harris A.L. Stratford I.J. Hankinson O. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 8104-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of CO on the translocation of HIF-1α into the nucleus. Western blot (Fig. 1E) and immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 1F) showed that HIF-1α accumulated in the nuclear fraction and nuclei in CORM-2-treated cells, indicating that CO causes an increase in HIF-1α protein level in astrocytes, particularly in the nuclei. Furthermore, we examined the role of HIF-1α in VEGF expression in astrocytes treated with CORM-2. CORM-2 increases the protein levels of HIF-1α and VEGF, and these effects were blocked by specific knockdown of HIF-1α using siRNA (Fig. 1G). In addition, CORM-2 treatment enhanced the secretion of VEGF into culture medium, and this enhancement was reduced by transfection with HIF-1α siRNA (Fig. 1G). These results demonstrate that CORM-2 induces VEGF production by up-regulating HIF-1α protein level without affecting transcriptional induction of HIF-1α. Because CO, produced by exogenous sources or catabolism of heme by HO-1, induces HO-1 expression in hepatoma cells (31Lee B.S. Heo J. Kim Y.M. Shim S.M. Pae H.O. Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we examined a role of HO-1 in CORM-2-induced increases in HIF-1α protein and VEGF expression. Treatment of human astrocytes with CORM-2 or the HO inducer hemin resulted in an increase in the protein levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, and HO-1 (Fig. 2A). Treatment with CORM-2 or hemin increased mRNA levels of VEGF and HO-1 but not HIF-1α (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, HO enzyme activity was significantly increased in CORM-2-treated cell lysates, as determined by in vitro bilirubin production, and this incre"

Previously, lunar lobate scarps could only be identified clearly in high-resolution Apollo Panoramic Camera images confined to the lunar equatorial zone. Now, an analysis by Watters et al. (p. 936 ) of images returned by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera reveals 14 previously unknown lobate scarps and shows that lunar lobate scarps may be globally distributed. Their appearance suggests that lunar scarps are relatively young landforms (less than 1 Ga), possibly formed during a recent episode of global lunar radial contraction."
https://openalex.org/W1986559385,"Eukaryotic cells use numerous mechanisms to ensure that no segment of their DNA is inappropriately re-replicated, but the importance of this stringent control on genome stability has not been tested. Here we show that re-replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can strongly induce the initial step of gene amplification, increasing gene copy number from one to two or more. The resulting amplicons consist of large internal chromosomal segments that are bounded by Ty repetitive elements and are intrachromosomally arrayed at their endogenous locus in direct head-to-tail orientation. These re-replication-induced gene amplifications are mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination between the repetitive elements. We suggest that re-replication may be a contributor to gene copy number changes, which are important in fields such as cancer biology, evolution, and human genetics."
https://openalex.org/W2136062554,"Fibrillar protein aggregates are the major pathological hallmark of several incurable, age-related, neurodegenerative disorders. These aggregates typically contain aggregation-prone pathogenic proteins, such as amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease and alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease. It is, however, poorly understood how these aggregates are formed during cellular aging. Here we identify an evolutionarily highly conserved modifier of aggregation, MOAG-4, as a positive regulator of aggregate formation in C. elegans models for polyglutamine diseases. Inactivation of MOAG-4 suppresses the formation of compact polyglutamine aggregation intermediates that are required for aggregate formation. The role of MOAG-4 in driving aggregation extends to amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein and is evolutionarily conserved in its human orthologs SERF1A and SERF2. MOAG-4/SERF appears to act independently from HSF-1-induced molecular chaperones, proteasomal degradation, and autophagy. Our results suggest that MOAG-4/SERF regulates age-related proteotoxicity through a previously unexplored pathway, which will open up new avenues for research on age-related, neurodegenerative diseases."

We show here that the S. cerevisiae Csm1/Lrs4 monopolin subcomplex has a distinctive V-shaped structure, with two pairs of protein-protein interaction domains positioned ∼10 nm apart. Csm1 presents a conserved hydrophobic surface patch that binds two kinetochore proteins: Dsn1, a subunit of the outer-kinetochore MIND/Mis12 complex, and Mif2/CENP-C. Csm1 point-mutations that disrupt kinetochore-subunit binding also disrupt sister chromatid co-orientation in S. cerevisiae meiosis I. We further show that the same Csm1 point-mutations affect rDNA silencing, probably by disrupting binding to the rDNA-associated protein Tof2.

In mitosis, chromosomes replicate and the resulting sister-chromatid pairs are held together along their length by cohesin complexes. Associated with the centromere of each chromatid is a kinetochore, a specialized protein assembly that captures microtubules (MTs) of the mitotic spindle. In early mitosis, each sister chromatid pair becomes “bi-oriented” when its kinetochores capture MTs extending from opposite spindle poles. Once all chromatid pairs are properly attached, cleavage of the cohesin links between sisters allows chromosome segregation and subsequent cell division. DNA replication and cell division strictly alternate in mitosis, but in meiosis, DNA replication is followed by two successive divisions to yield four haploid gametes. During meiotic prophase, homologous chromosomes align and form crossovers that hold them together. This organization allows for bi-orientation and segregation of homologs in meiosis I, followed by segregation of sister chromatids in meiosis II (Lee and Amon, 2001Lee B. Amon A. Meiosis: how to create a specialized cell cycle.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Marston and Amon, 2004Marston A.L. Amon A.

Thus, although sister chromatids bi-orient and segregate from each other in mitosis and meiosis II, they instead co-orient and segregate together in meiosis I. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sister chromatid co-orientation in meiosis I depends on the four-protein monopolin complex (Mam1, Csm1, Lrs4, and Hrr25/casein kinase 1), which localizes to centromeres from meiotic prophase through metaphase I (Monje-Casas et al., 2007Monje-Casas F.

It has been proposed that the monopolin complex crosslinks and/or co-orients sister kinetochores in meiosis I, so that they attach to MTs extending from the same spindle pole (Monje-Casas et al., 2007Monje-Casas F.

Although monopolin complex subunits have not been identified outside of fungi, the concept of sister kinetochore “fusion” in meiosis I may have parallels in higher eukaryotes: in maize meiosis I, for example, inner kinetochores of sister chromatids can be resolved by fluorescence microscopy, whereas their outer kinetochores appear fused (Li and Dawe, 2009Li X.

Orthologs of the monopolin subunits Csm1 and Lrs4 are present in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Pcs1 and Mde4, respectively) and also cycle between the nucleolus and kinetochores (Gregan et al., 2007Gregan J.

These proteins inhibit merotelic attachment (capture of a single kinetochore by MTs from opposite spindle poles) during mitosis, but they do not contribute to sister chromatid co-orientation in meiosis I. (An unrelated protein, Moa1, is important for ensuring meiosis I sister co-orientation in S. pombe, probably by modifying cohesin-complex function near centromeres [Yokobayashi and Watanabe, 2005Yokobayashi S.

Although S. cerevisiae kinetochores capture a single MT, S. pombe and higher eukaryotes assemble larger kinetochores that capture multiple MTs (2–4 in S. pombe [Ding et al., 1993Ding R. McDonald K.L.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1567-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar]). In this context, Pcs1 and Mde4 have been proposed to organize S. pombe kinetochores by clamping together adjacent MT-binding sites (Gregan et al., 2007Gregan J. Riedel C.G. Pidoux A.L. Katou Y. Rumpf C. Schleiffer A. Kearsey S.E. Shirahige K. Allshire R.C. Nasmyth K. The kinetochore proteins Pcs1 and Mde4 and heterochromatin are required to prevent merotelic orientation.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1190-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, Pcs1 and Mde4 have recently been shown to localize to the mitotic spindle in anaphase, revealing another potential function for monopolin in anaphase spindle elongation and stability (Choi et al., 2009Choi S.H.

During interphase, S. cerevisiae Csm1/Lrs4 and S. pombe Pcs1/Mde4 are both in the nucleolus, where they have been shown in S. cerevisiae to be important for maintaining the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (Gregan et al., 2007Gregan J.

The repetitive rDNA array (100–200 copies of a 9.1-kb repeat in S. cerevisiae) is normally kept in a silenced, heterochromatin-like state by a network of rDNA-associated proteins, including Fob1, Tof2, Csm1/Lrs4, and the RENT complex (Regulator of nucleolar silencing and telophase exit), which contains Net1/Cfi1, Cdc14, and the Sir2 histone deacetylase (Huang et al., 2006Huang J.

The rDNA is also protected from unequal sister chromatid exchange (USCE), which can lead to addition or deletion of repeats within the rDNA (Sinclair and Guarente, 1997Sinclair D.A. Guarente L.

Horiuchi T. The cis element and factors required for condensin recruitment to chromosomes.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 26-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), in addition to Sir2 (Huang et al., 2006Huang J. Brito I.L. Villen J. Gygi S.P. Amon A. Moazed D.

With the exception of Sir2, which independently contributes to USCE suppression, these proteins appear to tether rDNA repeats to the nuclear periphery, sequestering them from recombination factors (Mekhail et al., 2008Mekhail K. Seebacher J. Gygi S.P. Moazed D. Role for perinuclear chromosome tethering in maintenance of genome stability.Nature. 2008; 456: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and they may also clamp sister chromatids together in register (Brito et al., 2010Brito I.L.

Horiuchi T. The cis element and factors required for condensin recruitment to chromosomes.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 26-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, although Csm1/Lrs4 contributes to both rDNA silencing and USCE suppression, it acts with distinct sets of proteins in these different processes, raising the question of whether a common mechanism underlies these activities. The regulatory functions of monopolin described above suggest that Csm1/Lrs4 and the orthologous Pcs1/Mde4 are molecular crosslinkers, joining MT-binding elements at kinetochores and rDNA repeats in the nucleolus. We report here that S. cerevisiae Csm1 and Lrs4 form a complex with a distinctive “V” shape, which positions two pairs of protein-protein interaction domains ∼10 nm apart. We find that a conserved surface patch on these domains binds two kinetochore subunits: Dsn1, a subunit of the outer-kinetochore MIND/Mis12 complex, and Mif2/CENP-C. Point-mutations in this conserved surface disrupt both Dsn1 and Mif2 binding in vitro and cause bi-orientation of sister chromatids in meiosis I. These data are consistent with a model of monopolin as a crosslinker that clamps kinetochores together to enforce co-orientation in S. cerevisiae meiosis I and inhibit merotelic attachment in S. pombe mitosis. We also find that Csm1 interacts with the nucleolar protein Tof2 through the same conserved surface that interacts with Dsn1 and Mif2, and that mutating the Csm1 surface patch also disrupts rDNA silencing. These mutations do not, however, affect the rate of unequal sister chromatid exchange, demonstrating that Csm1/Lrs4 has two biochemically separate roles in the maintenance of rDNA. Overall, our data show that Csm1/Lrs4 is a molecular crosslinker that regulates kinetochore-microtubule attachment and helps preserve rDNA integrity. We purified full-length S. cerevisiae Csm1 and S. pombe Pcs1 proteins, as well as truncations lacking the bulk of their N-terminal regions, which are predicted to form coiled-coils (Gregan et al., 2007Gregan J. Riedel C.G. Pidoux A.L. Katou Y. Rumpf C. Schleiffer A. Kearsey S.E. Shirahige K. Allshire R.C. Nasmyth K.

By sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, we found that both constructs of Csm1 and Pcs1 are homodimers in solution (Table 1). We obtained crystals of both full-length S. cerevisiae Csm1 and its isolated C-terminal domain (residues 69–181 of 190). We determined the structure of the C-terminal domain to 2.35 Å resolution using anomalous diffraction methods with selenomethionine-derivatized protein (see Table S1, available online, for crystallographic statistics), and we then determined the structure of the full-length protein to 3.4 Å resolution by molecular replacement. The structures show that Csm1 has a 12-nm long, N-terminal coiled-coil (residues 3–82), and a C-terminal globular domain (residues 83–181) containing three α helices and five β strands (Figure 1A ). The β sheet of each monomer wraps around the N-terminal α helix of its dimer mate, forming an intimate dimer interface.Table 1Molecular Mass Determinations from Sedimentation Equilibrium CentrifugationProtein/ComplexObserved MW (kDa)Calculated MW (kDa)aCalculated MW is the expected molecular mass of a complex with the stoichiometry listed in “Oligomeric State.”Oligomeric StateCsm1 full-length43.2 ± 0.943.52 Csm1Csm1 1–18143.4 ± 1.241.22 Csm1Csm1 69–19029.1 ± 2.328.22 Csm1Pcs1 full-length53.4 ± 1.751.82 Pcs1Pcs1 85–22230.1 ± 2.332.22 Pcs1Csm1/Lrs4 full-length172.3 ± 4.7165.64 Csm1 + 2 Lrs4Csm1/Lrs4 1–130120.4 ± 3.1117.64 Csm1 + 2 Lrs4Csm1/Lrs4 1–102108.5 ± 3.0111.04 Csm1 + 2 Lrs4Csm1 1-181/Lrs4 2–3091.3 ± 3.189.74 Csm1 + 2 Lrs4Pcs1/Mde4 full-length164.2 ± 7.8198.94 Pcs1 + 2 Mde4Pcs1/Mde4 1–231160.2 ± 3.6156.94 Pcs1 + 2 Mde4Pcs1/Mde4 1–125127.0 ± 2.7132.54 Pcs1 + 2 Mde4Pcs1/Mde4 1–77108.2 ± 4.1121.04 Pcs1 + 2 Mde4a Calculated MW is the expected molecular mass of a complex with the stoichiometry listed in “Oligomeric State.” Open table in a new tab Csm1 is a structural relative of the kinetochore proteins Spc24 and Spc25 (Figures 1B and 1C) (Wei et al., 2006Wei R.R.

These proteins are paralogs that form a heterodimer similar to the Csm1 homodimer and constitute the inner half of the conserved Ndc80 kinetochore complex (Joglekar et al., 2006Joglekar A.P. Bouck D.C. Molk J.N. Bloom K.S. Salmon E.D. Molecular architecture of a kinetochore-microtubule attachment site.Nat.

Molecular organization of the Ndc80 complex, an essential kinetochore component.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The similarity of the tertiary and quaternary structures of Csm1 and Spc24/Spc25 imply a common evolutionary origin, despite their very low sequence identity (<15%). The C-terminal globular domains of Spc24 and Spc25 are thought to connect the Ndc80 complex with proteins of the inner kinetochore, suggesting that this domain of Csm1 may also be a protein interaction module. Inspection of amino acid conservation among 41 fungal Csm1/Pcs1 orthologs reveals a conserved surface patch on the face directly opposite the coiled-coil, bordering α-3, β-5, and α-4 (Figure 1D; Figure S1). The patch faces away from the dimer interface, so that the Csm1 dimer has two conserved surfaces centered ∼3 nm from each other. Because both α-3 and β-5 are located in a Csm1-specific insertion in the globular domain, this surface is not present in Spc24/Spc25. Therefore, it is unlikely that Csm1 and Spc24/Spc25 have a common binding site at kinetochores, despite their overall structural similarity. S. cerevisiae Csm1 and Lrs4 are known to interact through their N-terminal coiled-coil regions (Rabitsch et al., 2003Rabitsch K.P. Petronczki M. Javerzat J.P. Genier S. Chwalla B. Schleiffer A. Tanaka T.U. Nasmyth K. Kinetochore recruitment of two nucleolar proteins is required for homolog segregation in meiosis I.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Coexpression of Csm1 with full-length Lrs4 (347 residues) or with an isolated N-terminal segment (residues 1–130 or 1–102) yields a complex with four copies of Csm1 and two copies of Lrs4 (Table 1). Coexpression of S. pombe Pcs1 and Mde4 also yields a complex with 4:2 stoichiometry, with the N-terminal region of Mde4 (residues 1–77 of 421 is the smallest segment we have tested) sufficient for complex formation (Table 1; Figure S2). We obtained crystals of the complex between S. cerevisiae Csm1 and residues 1–102 of Lrs4, which diffracted anisotropically to between 6.0 Å (along the a∗ and b∗ reciprocal unit-cell axes) and 3.9 Å (along c∗) resolution, and we determined the structure by molecular replacement. We located two Csm1 homodimers per asymmetric unit and found that the N-terminal coiled-coils of these two dimers sandwich two closely packed, parallel, 30 amino acid α helices, creating a V-shaped complex that positions the two pairs of Csm1 globular domains ∼10 nm apart (Figures 2A and 2B ). Our electron density maps indicated that two copies of a ∼30 amino acid region of Lrs4 might be sufficient for complex formation with Csm1, but the low resolution precluded direct assignment of sequence to this electron density. From sequence conservation and secondary structure predictions, it appeared that the density probably represented two N-terminal segments of Lrs4, with the remainder of the protein (approximately residues 34–102) disordered in our crystals. Mixing Csm1 with a peptide containing Lrs4 residues 2–30 results in a stable complex with the expected molecular mass for a 4:2 complex (Table 1; Figure S2). This complex also forms crystals isomorphous to those of the complex with Lrs4 1–102 (data not shown), supporting the inference that Lrs4 residues 34–102 are disordered in the latter crystals and hence do not contribute to the diffraction intensities. We established the orientation and sequence register of the Lrs4 α helices using selenomethionine anomalous scattering from a construct containing a L8→M mutation in Lrs4. We observed a single anomalous difference peak in the electron density maps, directly between the two Lrs4 α helices (Figure 2C); at this resolution (6.0/3.9 Å), the single peak probably represents the anomalous scattering of both Se atoms in the Lrs4 dimer. This assignment indicates that the disordered C-terminal region of Lrs4 extends outward from the base of the observed V. We also examined the architecture of the native Csm1/Lrs4 complex using negative-stain electron microscopy. We purified Csm1/Lrs4 from mitotically cycling S. cerevisiae by TAP-tagging Lrs4, thus obtaining a near-native nucleolar form of Csm1/Lrs4. Individual particles of this complex, as well as of the recombinant Csm1/Lrs4 1–102 complex, show a clear V shape (Figures 2D and 2E), and class averages of the native full-length complex can be matched with 2D projections of the X-ray structure (Figure 2F). We can draw two conclusions from the close correspondence of the projections and class averages. First, the conformation of the complex is stiff and not grossly affected by the packing in our crystals. Second, the bulk of the two Lrs4 subunits is either largely disordered in solution or flexibly linked to the rest of the complex. This conclusion is consistent with our observation that residues ∼34–102 are disordered in the crystal structure of Csm1/Lrs4 1–102. The C-terminal region of Lrs4 is nonetheless crucial for regulation of monopolin: phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Lrs4 (and its S. pombe ortholog Mde4) is needed for localization and activity at kinetochores (Choi et al., 2009Choi S.H.

Glycomic profiling of SRECs by mass spectrometry revealed a diverse range of glycans terminating in sialic acid or GalαGal. In terms of sialylation, α2-6 linkage was more abundant than α2-3, and NeuAc was more abundant than NeuGc. Virus binding and infection experiments were conducted to determine functionally important glycans for influenza virus infection, with a focus on recently emerged swine viruses. Infection of SRECs with swine and human viruses resulted in different infectivity levels. Glycan microarray analysis with a high infectivity ""triple reassortant"" virus ((A/Swine/MN/593/99 (H3N2)) that spread widely throughout the North American swine population and a lower infectivity human virus isolated from a single pig (A/Swine/ONT/00130/97 (H3N2)) showed that both viruses bound exclusively to glycans containing NeuAcα2-6, with strong binding to sialylated polylactosamine and sialylated N-glycans. Treatment with mannosamine precursors of sialic acid (to alter NeuAc/NeuGc abundances) and linkage-specific sialidases prior to infection indicated that the influenza viruses tested preferentially utilize NeuAcα2-6-sialylated glycans to infect SRECs. Our data indicate that NeuAcα2-6-terminated polylactosamine and sialylated N-glycans are important determinants for influenza viruses to infect SRECs. As NeuAcα2-6 polylactosamine glycans play major roles in human virus infection, the importance of these receptor components in virus infection of swine cells has implications for transmission of viruses between humans and pigs and for pigs as possible adaptation hosts of novel human influenza viruses."

VPA0450 disrupted cytoskeletal binding sites on the inner surface of membranes of human cells and caused plasma membrane blebbing, which compromised membrane integrity and probably contributed to cell death by facilitating lysis.

Proline-directed phosphorylation acted additively to regulate multiple aspects of ATF4 degradation. Stabilized ATF4 mutants exhibit decreased β-TrCP degron phosphorylation, β-TrCP interaction, and ubiquitination, as well as elicit early G(1) arrest. Expression of stabilized ATF4 also had significant consequences in the developing neocortex. Mutant ATF4 expressing cells exhibited positioning and differentiation defects that were attributed to early G(1) arrest, suggesting that neurogenesis is sensitive to ATF4 dosage. We propose that precise regulation of the ATF4 dosage impacts cell cycle control and impinges on neurogenesis."

Because SOS1 is phosphorylated at multiple serine residues upon stimulation, we evaluated the role of the multiplicity by building two simulation models, which we termed the decisive and cooperative phosphorylation models. The two models were constrained by the duration of Ras activation and basal phosphorylation level of SOS1. Possible solutions were found only in the decisive model wherein at least three, and probably more than four, phosphorylation sites decisively suppress the SOS activity. Thus, the combination of experimental approaches and the model analysis has suggested an unexpected role of multiple phosphorylations of SOS1 in the negative regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2132495676,Mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a sensor of cellular energy status. It is activated by phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit on Thr172. The main objective of this study was the identification of a phosphatase involved in the regulation of AMPK activity. Mouse MIN6 β cells were used to study the glucose-induced regulation of the phosphorylation of AMPK. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology was used to deplete putative phosphatase candidate genes that could affect AMPK regulation. The effect of the siRNAs used in the study was compared with the effect observed using a negative control siRNA. A protein phosphatase complex composed of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and the regulatory subunit R6 participates in the glucose-induced dephosphorylation of AMPK. R6 interacts physically with the β-subunit of the AMPK complex and recruits PP1 to dephosphorylate the catalytic α-subunit on Thr172. siRNA depletion of R6 decreases glucose-induced insulin secretion due to the presence of a constitutively active AMPK complex. The characterization of the PP1-R6 complex identifies this holoenzyme as a possible target for therapeutic intervention with the aim of regulating the activity of AMPK in pancreatic β cells.

https://openalex.org/W2052407447,"The molecular cloud in the Orion nebula, at about 414 parsecs from Earth, gives us our closest view of massive-star formation. It has been predicted from star-formation models that the gases heated and ionized in the process will generate wave-like structures as they are blown over pre-existing molecular gas. These waves have now been observed, in a new series of radio maps of the Orion nebula. The waves are thought to result from Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, a phenomenon seen at the interface between fluids with different densities and velocities, and further observations of such periodic structures should provide insight into the mechanisms of massive-star formation and its effects on the surrounding region of the molecular cloud. It has long been suspected that the development of hydrodynamical instabilities can compress or fragment a molecular cloud (in which stars are born). One key signature of an instability would be a wave-like structure in the gas, although this has not yet been seen. Now, the presence of 'waves' is reported at the surface of the Orion cloud, near where massive stars are forming. The waves probably arise as gas that is heated and ionized by massive stars is blown over pre-existing molecular gas. Massive stars influence their parental molecular cloud, and it has long been suspected that the development of hydrodynamical instabilities can compress or fragment the cloud1,2. Identifying such instabilities has proved difficult. It has been suggested that elongated structures (such as the ‘pillars of creation’3) and other shapes arise because of instabilities4,5, but alternative explanations are available6,7. One key signature of an instability is a wave-like structure in the gas, which has hitherto not been seen. Here we report the presence of ‘waves’ at the surface of the Orion molecular cloud near where massive stars are forming. The waves seem to be a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability that arises during the expansion of the nebula as gas heated and ionized by massive stars is blown over pre-existing molecular gas."
https://openalex.org/W2089265990,"The X(+)-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X(+)-CGD) variants are natural mutants characterized by defective NADPH oxidase activity but with normal Nox2 expression. According to the three-dimensional model of the cytosolic Nox2 domain, most of the X(+)-CGD mutations are located in/or close to the FAD/NADPH binding regions. A structure/function study of this domain was conducted in X(+)-CGD PLB-985 cells exactly mimicking 10 human variants: T341K, C369R, G408E, G408R, P415H, P415L, Δ507QKT509-HIWAinsert, C537R, L546P, and E568K. Diaphorase activity is defective in all these mutants. NADPH oxidase assembly is normal for P415H/P415L and T341K mutants where mutation occurs in the consensus sequences of NADPH- and FAD-binding sites, respectively. This is in accordance with their buried position in the three-dimensional model of the cytosolic Nox2 domain. FAD incorporation is abolished only in the T341K mutant explaining its absence of diaphorase activity. This demonstrates that NADPH oxidase assembly can occur without FAD incorporation. In addition, a defect of NADPH binding is a plausible explanation for the diaphorase activity inhibition in the P415H, P415L, and C537R mutants. In contrast, Cys-369, Gly-408, Leu-546, and Glu-568 are essential for NADPH oxidase complex assembly. However, according to their position in the three-dimensional model of the cytosolic domain of Nox2, only Cys-369 could be in direct contact with cytosolic factors during oxidase assembly. In addition, the defect in oxidase assembly observed in the C369R, G408E, G408R, and E568K mutants correlates with the lack of FAD incorporation. Thus, the NADPH oxidase assembly process and FAD incorporation are closely related events essential for the diaphorase activity of Nox2."
https://openalex.org/W1994139792,"Folates are essential vitamins that play a key role as one-carbon donors in a spectrum of biosynthetic pathways including RNA and DNA synthesis. The proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT/SLC46A1) mediates obligatory intestinal folate absorption. Loss-of-function mutations in PCFT result in hereditary folate malabsorption, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by very low folate levels in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Hereditary folate malabsorption manifests within the first months after birth with anemia, immune deficiency, and neurological deficits. Here we studied the role of inducible trans-activators of PCFT gene expression. Bioinformatics identified three putative nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) binding sites in the minimal promoter. The following evidence establish that PCFT is an NRF-1-responsive gene; electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed NRF-1 binding to native but not mutant NRF-1 sites, whereas antibody-mediated supershift analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed NRF-1 binding to its consensus sites within the PCFT promoter. Moreover, mutational inactivation of individual or all NRF-1 binding sites resulted in 40-60% decrease in luciferase reporter activity. Consistently, overexpression of NRF-1 or a constitutively active NRF-1 VP-16 construct resulted in increased reporter activity and PCFT mRNA levels. Conversely, introduction of a dominant-negative NRF-1 construct markedly repressed reporter activity and PCFT mRNA levels; likewise, introduction of NRF-1 siRNA duplexes to cells resulted in decreased PCFT transcript levels. Moreover, NRF-1 silencing down-regulated genes encoding for key folate transporters and enzymes in folate metabolism. These novel findings identify NRF-1 as a major inducible transcriptional regulator of PCFT gene expression. The implications of this linkage between folate transport and metabolism with mitochondria biogenesis and respiration are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2050467268,"Human secreted protein stabilin-1 interacting chitinase-like protein (SI-CLP) has been identified as a novel member of Glyco_18 domain-containing proteins that is involved in host defense and inflammatory reactions. Efficient secretion of SI-CLP is mediated by its interaction with the endocytic/sorting receptor stabilin-1. SI-CLP is expressed abundantly in macrophages and neutrophils and is up-regulated by Th2 cytokine IL-4 and glucocorticoid, which suggest that SI-CLP could be a marker for adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy. To gain insight into the biological function of SI-CLP, we determined the crystal structure of SI-CLP at 2.7 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography and found that it featured a typical triose-phosphate isomerase barrel fold with a putative saccharide-binding cleft. Comparison with other chitinase-like proteins showed the cleft to be atypically wide and open. The saccharide-binding capacity of SI-CLP was investigated, and its ligand-binding specificity was found to relate to the length of the oligosaccharides, with preference for chitotetraose. Further investigations reveal that SI-CLP could bind LPS in vitro and neutralize its endotoxin effect on macrophages. Our results demonstrate the saccharide-binding property of SI-CLP by structure and in vitro biochemical analyses and suggest the possible roles of SI-CLP in pathogen sensing and endotoxin neutralization."
https://openalex.org/W2105993413,"Growing evidence indicates a critical role of ubiquitin-proteosome system in apoptosis regulation. A cardioprotective effect of ubiquitin (Ub) ligase of the C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) on myocytes has been reported. In the current study, we found that the cardioprotective effect of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was mediated by ERK5-CHIP signal module via inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) destabilization. In vitro runoff assay and Ub assay showed ICER as a substrate of CHIP Ub ligase. Both disruption of ERK5-CHIP binding with inhibitory helical linker domain fragment (aa 101-200) of CHIP and the depletion of ERK5 by siRNA inhibited CHIP Ub ligase activity, which suggests an obligatory role of ERK5 on CHIP activation. Depletion of CHIP, using siRNA, inhibited IGF-1-mediated reduction of isoproterenol-mediated ICER induction and apoptosis. In diabetic mice subjected to myocardial infarction, the CHIP Ub ligase activity was decreased, with an increase in ICER expression. These changes were attenuated significantly in a cardiac-specific constitutively active form of MEK5α transgenic mice (CA-MEK5α-Tg) previously shown to have greater functional recovery. Furthermore, pressure overload-mediated ICER induction was enhanced in heterozygous CHIP(+/-) mice. We identified ICER as a novel CHIP substrate and that the ERK5-CHIP complex plays an obligatory role in inhibition of ICER expression, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1972294572,"The MAPK-activated protein kinases (MAPKAP kinases) MK2 and MK3 are directly activated via p38 MAPK phosphorylation, stabilize p38 by complex formation, and contribute to the stress response. The list of substrates of MK2/3 is increasing steadily. We applied a phosphoproteomics approach to compare protein phosphorylation in MK2/3-deficient cells rescued or not by ectopic expression of MK2. In addition to differences in phosphorylation of the known substrates of MK2, HSPB1 and Bag-2, we identified strong differences in phosphorylation of keratin 8 (K8). The phosphorylation of K8-Ser(73) is catalyzed directly by p38, which in turn shows MK2-dependent expression. Notably, analysis of small molecule p38 inhibitors on K8-Ser(73) phosphorylation also demonstrated reduced phosphorylations of keratins K18-Ser(52) and K20-Ser(13) but not of K8-Ser(431) or K18-Ser(33). Interestingly, K18-Ser(52) and K20-Ser(13) are not directly phosphorylated by p38 in vitro, but by MK2. Furthermore, anisomycin-stimulated phosphorylations of K20-Ser(13) and K18-Ser(52) are inhibited by small molecule inhibitors of both p38 and MK2. MK2 knockdown in HT29 cells leads to reduced K20-Ser(13) phosphorylation, which further supports the notion that MK2 is responsible for K20 phosphorylation in vivo. Physiologic relevance of these findings was confirmed by differences of K20-Ser(13) phosphorylation between the ileum of wild-type and MK2/3-deficient mice and by demonstrating p38- and MK2-dependent mucin secretion of HT29 cells. Therefore, MK2 and p38 MAPK function in concert to phosphorylate K8, K18, and K20 in intestinal epithelia."

In the present study, we explored the conditions under which glucose and ribose can glycate spectrin, both on the intact membrane and in solution and the functional consequences of spectrin glycation.

We infer that the absence of glycation in situ is the consequence of the interaction of the target lysine and arginine residues with PS and thus is inaccessible for glycation. The reduced membrane deformability after glycation in the absence of ATP is likely the result of the inability of the glycated spectrin repeats to undergo the obligatory unfolding as a consequence of interhelix cross-links. We thus postulate that through the use of an ATP-driven phospholipid translocase (flippase), erythrocytes have evolved a protective mechanism against spectrin glycation and thus maintain their optimal membrane function during their long circulatory life span.

The metal ion-dependent adhesion site on the I-domain of LFA-1 αL subunit is the key recognition site for ligand binding.

Using the purified HA I-domain locked by disulfide bonds for immunization, we developed an mAb, 2E8, that specifically binds to cells expressing the HA LFA-1. The surface plasmon resonance analysis has shown that 2E8 only binds to the HA I-domain and that the dissociation constant (KD) for HA I-domain is 197 nm.

Constitutively expressed on the surface of leukocytes in an inactive state, LFA-1 activation undergoes two distinct conformational changes that allow ligand binding: 1) a switchblade-like motion that exposes the I-domain, which increases its accessibility; 2) conformational changes in the I-domain that reorient the divalent cation within the MIDAS to be exposed and thus increase the affinity of LFA-1 to its ligand (10Shimaoka M.

However, the withdrawal of Efalizumab due to viral-induced progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy indicates that the effectiveness of anti-LFA-1 therapy might be limited by the inability to target the activated form of LFA-1 (23Pugashetti R.

With recent advances in understanding the structure and function of LFA-1 activation, developing second generation mAbs that selectively target the HA I-domain may prove clinically advantageous as a result of improved specificity and potency. Herein, we report the generation and characterization of an anti-human LFA-1 mAb 2E8. 2E8 binds to the HA I-domain in a metal ion-dependent manner and blocks the binding of HA I-domain to ICAM-1. In addition, the binding of 2E8 is sensitive to the activation and affinity up-regulation of LFA-1 on human cell lines. 2E8 has differential effects on human T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity.DISCUSSIONWe report a novel mAb, 2E8, that specifically binds to the HA I-domain of LFA-1. In addition, 2E8 blocks the interaction of LFA-1 to its ligand ICAM-1. The binding of 2E8 is metal ion-dependent, and thus the binding site is likely associated with the MIDAS. Furthermore, 2E8 recognizes Mn2+-activated LFA-1 but not LFA-1 in the resting state on human cells. Therefore, 2E8 is an activation-sensitive mAb and demonstrates the appearance of activation-induced conformational changes in the I-domain. More importantly, we have shown here that 2E8 can inhibit human T cell proliferation without affecting their cytolytic function.LFA-1 is an important molecule in the immune system, and its activation state influences the outcome of T cell activation (30Huppa J.B.

There has been long standing interest in LFA-1 as a therapeutic target for regulating immunity.

Although Efalizumab showed promise in treating psoriasis patients, it was voluntarily removed from the market due to patients developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, possibly through completely down-regulating T cell function. Developing the second generation of antibodies, such as 2E8, that specifically target the HA LFA-1 I-domain as therapeutic inhibitors is the logical next step.AL-57, an mAb against both the HA and the IA I-domain of LFA-1, was developed recently by phage display and recognizes the affinity-up-regulated I-domain in a ligand mimetic fashion (32Shimaoka M. Kim M. Cohen E.H. Yang W. Astrof N. Peer D. Salas A. Ferrand A. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13991-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Huang L. Shimaoka M.

The crystal structures (3HI5 and 3HI6) of the Fab fragment of AL-57 in complex with the locked IA I-domain demonstrates that AL-57 coordinates with the MIDAS in a similar geometry as ICAM-1 and that the binding site of AL-57 overlaps the ICAM-1 binding site on the I-domain (34Zhang H. Liu J.H. Yang W. Springer T. Shimaoka M. Wang J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18345-18350Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additionally, a hydrophobic patch further stabilizes the AL-57/I-domain interface to outcompete ICAM-1 for the MIDAS site (32Shimaoka M. Kim M. Cohen E.H. Yang W. Astrof N. Peer D. Salas A. Ferrand A. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13991-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Zhang H. Liu J.H. Yang W. Springer T. Shimaoka M. Wang J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18345-18350Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Similar to ICAM-1, the binding of 2E8 to the I-domain requires the presence of a divalent cation and thus is metal ion-dependent (32Shimaoka M. Kim M. Cohen E.H. Yang W. Astrof N. Peer D. Salas A. Ferrand A. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13991-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This indicates that the 2E8/I-domain binding possibly acts in a typical ligand/integrin MIDAS interaction, which requires an acidic residue interacting with the metal ion bound I-domain (16Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.H. Springer T.A.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3366-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 2E8 may have a primary binding site located at the MIDAS and is most likely mediated through a glutamic or aspartic acid carboxyl group. A comparison of binding kinetics demonstrates that the KD of 2E8 to HA I-domain is an order of magnitude weaker than that of AL-57 (197 versus 23 nm, respectively) but close to the KD of ICAM-1 to HA I-domain at 310 nm (26Carreño R. Li D. Sen M. Nira I. Yamakawa T. Ma Q. Legge G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10642-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).An important attribute of 2E8 is the specificity for the HA I-domain over both the IA and the WT forms. In contrast to AL-57, 2E8 does not bind to the IA I-domain (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we have shown that 2E8 not only blocks the binding of HA I-domain to ICAM-1 but also prevents LFA-1-mediated cell aggregation. 2E8 preferentially recognizes the active conformation of the I-domain and selectively binds activated LFA-1 on cells; thus, the binding is in an activation-specific manner.In addition to functioning as an adhesion molecule for leukocyte migration and adhesion, LFA-1 plays a critical role in regulating T cell function in the context of immunological synapse. Specifically, LFA-1 is a costimulatory molecule mediating T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity (30Huppa J.B. Davis M.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 31Dustin M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We demonstrated the affinity changes in the I-domain of LFA-1 during mouse T cell activation (17Wang Y. Li D. Nurieva R. Yang J. Sen M. Carreño R. Lu S. McIntyre B.W. Molldrem J.J. Legge G.B. Ma Q.

However, little is known on the role of high affinity LFA-1 in human T cell function, although Efalizumab has been used in the clinic to target the I-domain of LFA-1 in inflammatory responses (18Nicolls M.R. Gill R.G. Am. J. Transplant. 2006; 6: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Scheinfeld N. Expert. Opin. Drug.

Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 2771-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It binds to both the low and the high affinity form of I-domain (23Pugashetti R. Koo J. J. Dermatolog. Treat. 2009; 20: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Major E.O. Annu. Rev. Med. 2010; 61: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We found that 2E8 can block both human primary CD4+ and human primary CD8+ T cell proliferation, albeit less efficiently than MHM24. Interestingly, the cytolytic activity of human T cells remains intact in the presence of 2E8, which is in contrast to MHM24, which can significantly inhibit specific lysis of target cells. The data suggest that there might be differential requirement of LFA-1 activation in T cell proliferation and cytolytic function, which remains to be investigated and understood in the future.In summary, we developed and characterized 2E8 that specifically binds to the MIDAS site of the high affinity I-domain of LFA-1. Our study improves the understanding of the structure and function aspects of LFA-1 biology. Furthermore, 2E8 is a potentially novel reagent for blocking high affinity LFA-1 and modulating T cell activation.

The ligands for LFA-1 are intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), ICAM-2, and ICAM-3, which are members of the Ig superfamily (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar). Although LFA-1 is constitutively expressed on the surface of leukocytes in an inactive state, binding to its ligands requires cellular activation involving both affinity (conformational change within the molecule) and avidity (receptor clustering) enhancement (3Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 4Hogg N. Smith A. McDowall A. Giles K. Stanley P. Laschinger M. Henderson R. Immunol.

Med. 2003; 349: 2004-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar).The αL subunit of LFA-1 has two prominent structural features, an inserted-domain (I-domain) of about 200 amino acid residues and three EF hand-like repeats containing putative divalent cation binding sites (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar). The I-domain of the LFA-1 αL subunit is the ligand binding site and changes conformation upon activation (10Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The changes in the I-domain from the low affinity state to the high affinity state lead to an increased affinity for ligand binding (11Legge G.B. Morris G.M. Sanner M.F. Takada Y. Olson A.J. Grynszpan F. Proteins. 2002; 48: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10638-10641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The key recognition site for ligand binding is at the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) on the I-domain of the LFA-1 αL subunit (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar, 2Dustin M.L. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 987: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Constitutively expressed on the surface of leukocytes in an inactive state, LFA-1 activation undergoes two distinct conformational changes that allow ligand binding: 1) a switchblade-like motion that exposes the I-domain, which increases its accessibility; 2) conformational changes in the I-domain that reorient the divalent cation within the MIDAS to be exposed and thus increase the affinity of LFA-1 to its ligand (10Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 11Legge G.B. Morris G.M. Sanner M.F. Takada Y. Olson A.J. Grynszpan F. Proteins. 2002; 48: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The conformational states of the I-domain can be classified as low affinity (LA) and high affinity (HA) when in the inactive and active state, respectively. The I-domain exists in open and closed conformations and a recently described intermediate affinity (IA) conformation, which differs in affinity for ligand (16Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). By introducing disulfide bonds into the I-domain, LFA-1 can be locked in either the open or the closed conformation, which represents the HA (K287C/K297C) or LA (K287C/K294C) state, respectively (13Lu C.

We identified antibodies that are sensitive to the affinity changes in the I-domain of mouse LFA-1 and showed that the activation-dependent epitopes were exposed upon mouse T cell activation (17Wang Y.

Taken together, these data demonstrated that the I-domain of LFA-1 changes to the high affinity state upon leukocyte activation.The I-domain of LFA-1 has been a therapeutic target for regulating inflammatory responses (18Nicolls M.R.

Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 2771-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Efalizumab, an mAb blocking non-selectively the HA and LA LFA-1, has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis (21Gordon K.B. Papp K.A. Hamilton T.K. Walicke P.A. Dummer W. Li N. Bresnahan B.W. Menter A. Efalizumab Study Group JAMA. 2003; 290: 3073-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, the withdrawal of Efalizumab due to viral-induced progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy indicates that the effectiveness of anti-LFA-1 therapy might be limited by the inability to target the activated form of LFA-1 (23Pugashetti R. Koo J. J. Dermatolog. Treat. 2009; 20: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Major E.O. Annu. Rev. Med. 2010; 61: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). With recent advances in understanding the structure and function of LFA-1 activation, developing second generation mAbs that selectively target the HA I-domain may prove clinically advantageous as a result of improved specificity and potency. Herein, we report the generation and characterization of an anti-human LFA-1 mAb 2E8. 2E8 binds to the HA I-domain in a metal ion-dependent manner and blocks the binding of HA I-domain to ICAM-1. In addition, the binding of 2E8 is sensitive to the activation and affinity up-regulation of LFA-1 on human cell lines. 2E8 has differential effects on human T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity.

PCC 6803. Complementation analysis of this mutant (Tsll0606) indicated that an intact sll0606 gene could fully restore photoautotrophic growth. Gene organization in the vicinity of sll0606 indicates that it is not contained in an operon. No electron transport activity was detected in Tsll0606 using water as an electron donor and 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone as an electron acceptor, indicating that Photosystem II (PS II) was defective. Electron transport activity using dichlorophenol indolephenol plus ascorbate as an electron donor to methyl viologen, however, was the same as observed in the control strain. This indicated that electron flow through Photosystem I was normal. Fluorescence induction and decay parameters verified that Photosystem II was highly compromised. The quantum yield for energy trapping by Photosystem II (F(V)/F(M)) in the mutant was less than 10% of that observed in the control strain. The small variable fluorescence yield observed after a single saturating flash exhibited aberrant Q(A)(-) reoxidation kinetics that were insensitive to dichloromethylurea. Immunological analysis indicated that whereas the D2 and CP47 proteins were modestly affected, the D1 and CP43 components were dramatically reduced. Analysis of two-dimensional blue native/lithium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels indicated that no intact PS II monomer or dimers were observed in the mutant. The CP43-less PS II monomer did accumulate to detectable levels. Our results indicate that the Sll0606 protein is required for the assembly/stability of a functionally competent Photosystem II."
https://openalex.org/W2151936696,"Bone marrow-derived progenitor cells can fuse with cells of several different tissues, including lung, especially following injury. Despite many reports of cell fusion, few studies have examined the function of the resulting hybrid cells. We cocultured human multipotent stromal cells (hMSCs) and normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs) and observed the formation of hMSC/NHBE heterokaryons. The heterokaryons expressed several proteins characteristic of epithelial cells, such as keratin and occludin. Hybrid cells also expressed the mRNAs and proteins for 2 important ion channels that maintain bronchial and alveolar fluid balance: the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC). By immunocytochemistry, CFTR was expressed in many hybrid cells but was absent or low in others. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated a glibenclamide-sensitive current in the presence of barium chloride, consistent with functional CFTR channels, in control NHBEs and hMSC/NHBE heterokaryons. Total cell capacitance measurements showed that the membrane surface area of heterokaryons was similar to that of NHBEs. Heterokaryons expressed the α- and γ-ENaC subunits but did not express the β-ENaC subunit, indicating the inability to form a complete ENaC channel. In addition, hybrid cells formed by the fusion of hMSCs with immortalized bronchial cells that expressed CFTR ΔF508 did not lead to reprogramming of the hMSC nucleus and expression of wild-type CFTR mRNA. Our data show that reprogramming can be incomplete following fusion of adult progenitor cells and somatic cells and may lead to altered cell function."
