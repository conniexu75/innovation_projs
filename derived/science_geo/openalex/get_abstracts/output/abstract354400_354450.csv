https://openalex.org/W2015018301,"The identification of target mRNAs is a key step for assessing the role of aberrantly expressed microRNAs in human cancer. MiR-221 is upregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as in other malignancies. One proven target of miR-221 is CDKN1B/p27, whose downregulation affects HCC prognosis. Here, we proved that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) CDKN1C/p57 is also a direct target of miR-221. Indeed, downregulation of both CDKN1B/p27 and CDKN1C/p57 occurs in response to miR-221 transfection into HCC-derived cells and a significant upregulation of both CDKN1B/p27 and CDKN1C/p57 occurs in response to antimiR-221 transfection. A direct interaction of miR-221 with a target site on the 3′ UTR of CDKN1C/p57 mRNA was also demonstrated. By controlling these two CDKIs, upregulation of miR-221 can promote growth of HCC cells by increasing the number of cells in S-phase. To assess the relevance of these studies in primary tumors, matched HCC and cirrhosis samples were assayed for miR-221, for CDKN1B/p27 and CDKN1C/p57 expression. MiR-221 was upregulated in 71% of HCCs, whereas CDKN1B/p27 and CDKN1C/p57 proteins were downregulated in 77% of cases. A significant inverse correlation between miR-221 and both CDKN1B/p27 and CDKN1C/p57 was found in HCCs. In conclusion, we suggest that miR-221 has an oncogenic function in hepatocarcinogenesis by targeting CDKN1B/p27 and CDKN1C/p57, hence promoting proliferation by controlling cell-cycle inhibitors. These findings establish a basis toward the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking miR-221 in HCC."

Mitochondrial ROS has also been shown to be involved in cellular signaling. It is generally assumed that ubisemiquinone formed at the ubiquinol oxidation center of the cytochrome bc1 complex is one of two sources of electrons for superoxide formation in mitochondria. Here we show that superoxide formation at the ubiquinol oxidation center of the membrane-bound or purified cytochrome bc1 complex is stimulated by the presence of oxidized ubiquinone indicating that in a reverse reaction the electron is transferred onto oxygen from reduced cytochrome bL via ubiquinone rather than during the forward ubiquinone cycle reaction. In fact, from mechanistic studies it seems unlikely that during normal catalysis the ubisemiquinone intermediate reaches significant occupancies at the ubiquinol oxidation site. We conclude that cytochrome bc1 complex-linked ROS production is primarily promoted by a partially oxidized rather than by a fully reduced ubiquinone pool. The resulting mechanism of ROS production offers a straightforward explanation of how the redox state of the ubiquinone pool could play a central role in mitochondrial redox signaling.

ROS have been implicated in apoptosis, cellular injury during ischemia and reperfusion, and the aging process as well as in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson, Huntington, and Alzheimer diseases (2Benzi G.

Within the respiratory chain, complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and the cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III, ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase) were identified as the main sources of superoxide anion radicals (O2.¯; Fig. 1). In complex I, superoxide was shown to be produced primarily by the oxidation of reduced flavine or flavine semiquinone (5Galkin A. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30129-30135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 6Kussmaul L. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). It has been shown a long time ago (7Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 8Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.I. Stoppani A.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) that superoxide is formed at the ubiquinol oxidation center (Qo site, center P) of the cytochrome bc1 complex. The rate of superoxide formation is strongly increased under conditions of so-called oxidant-induced reduction, i.e. in the presence of the specific center N inhibitor antimycin A, sufficient amounts of reducing equivalents, and an oxidized downstream respiratory chain. According to the general scheme of the protonmotive Q cycle operating in the cytochrome bc1 complex, ubisemiquinone is formed during ubiquinol oxidation (9Brandt U. Trumpower B.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, more recent mechanistic studies aimed at understanding the strict control of the Q cycle suggest that the bifurcated ubiquinol oxidation at center P occurs in a quasiconcerted reaction (10Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Snyder C.H. Gutiérrez-Cirlos E-B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

Sci. 2005; 30: 176-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In fact, formation of semiquinone (O.¯) associated with center P was difficult to show experimentally, and the occupancy for this redox intermediate generated under special conditions is rather low (14de Vries S. Albracht S.P.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11996-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhang H. Osyczka A. Dutton P.L. Moser C.C. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 2007; 104: 7887-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This implies that ubisemiquinone is formed only very transiently at center P, if at all, and never accumulates to significant amounts in the functional enzyme. Therefore, the assumption generally adopted in the ROS field that oxygen reacts with semiquinone formed as a reaction intermediate of the protonmotive Q cycle to form superoxide is probably not suffcient. Here we show with membrane-bound and purified detergent-solubilized enzyme that superoxide formation is maximal at center P of the cytochrome bc1 complex if the ubiquinone pool is partially oxidized. This implies a mechanism by which superoxide is formed in a reverse reaction via oxidation of reduced heme bL (high potential cytochrome b) and with ubiquinone acting as a redox mediator. Sample Preparation—Submitochondrial particles (SMPs) from bovine heart mitochondria were prepared as described by Okun et al. (17Okun J.G. Lümmen P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2625-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The preparation used in the experiments had a protein concentration of 26.8 mg/ml, and the heme content was 17.2 μm cytochrome b and 19.8 μm heme a + a3. Cytochrome bc1 complex was purified from bovine heart mitochondria as described by Engel et al. (18Engel W.D. Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 1753-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The concentration of cytochrome b was determined spectroscopically using ϵ562-575 = 28.5 mm-1 cm-1. Protein concentrations were determined according to a modified Lowry protocol. The reduced form of decylubiquinone (DBH) was produced by dithionite reduction of the oxidized form (DBQ) according to a protocol of Wan et al. (19Wan Y.-P. Williams R.H. Folkers K. Leung K.H. Racker E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The concentration of the ethanolic solution was determined spectrophotometrically using ϵ290: 4.2 mm-1 cm-1. Measurement of ROS Production—ROS were detected by the Amplex Red/HRP (horseradish peroxidase) assay (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) in a SpectraMax Plus microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 30 °C (20Dröse S. Brandt U. Hanley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23733-23739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 0.1 mg/ml SMPs were used in a reaction mixture containing 50 μm Amplex Red, 0.1 unit/ml HRP, 75 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and (where necessary) 100 units/ml superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD). ROS production of purified cytochrome bc1 complex was measured at the isosbestic point of cytochrome c at 540 nm in the presence of 100 units/ml SOD, 50-100 μm cytochrome c, and 200 μm DBH. In some experiments, the oxidation level of the Q pool was adjusted by the application of known mixtures of DBH and DBQ at a total ubiquinone concentration of 200 μm. For activation, the enzyme was mixed with 75% phosphatidylcholine (99%, Sigma type III-E), 20% phosphatidylethanolamine (98%, Sigma type IV-S), and 5% cardiolipin (>80%, bovine heart) dissolved in 1.7% sodium cholate and 2.4% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside at a molar ratio of about 1:3000. Because the ϵ563 could not be used for the calculation of the H2O2 generation, the assay was calibrated with known H2O2 concentrations. Inhibition of Succinate Oxidase—Inhibition of succinate oxidase by malonate and oxalacetate was determined at 25 °C with an Oxygraph-2k (Oroboros), chamber volumes of 2 ml, using 54 μg of SMP and 5 mm succinate in 75 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2O. Statistics—All experiments were performed in triplicate and data are given ±S.D. Partial Inhibition of Complex II Stimulates Complex III-dependent ROS Production—First we analyzed the effect of different respiratory chain inhibitors on the production of ROS by submitochondrial particles prepared from bovine heart mitochondria (Fig. 2). We employed the HRP/Amplex Red assay to monitor ROS generation. This assay detects hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that is formed by spontaneous dismutation of superoxide, the primary ROS species generated by the electron transfer chain. The addition of SOD to the assay had almost no effect on the rate of H2O2 generation indicating that the SMP preparation contained a sufficient amount of endogenous SOD (21Chen Q. Vazquez E.J. Moghaddas S. Hoppel C.L. Lesnefsky E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36027-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Yet, if NADH was used as a substrate, it was necessary to add SOD to reduce the substrate-dependent background rate of the assay. With NADH-consuming SMP (Fig. 2A), the basal rate of H2O2 generation was increased approximately 2-fold following the addition of the complex I inhibitors n-decylquinazolineamine or rotenone due to increased ROS production by complex I. When we added antimycin A, an inhibitor of center N of the cytochrome bc1 complex, ROS production was more than 4 times faster than the basal rate. Addition of the center P inhibitor stigmatellin alone or in the presence of antimycin A reduced the rate back to the “rotenone level.” Also addition of rotenone abolished most of the increase induced by antimycin A. Inhibition of center P-linked ROS production was significantly less efficient with myxothiazol than with stigmatellin (not shown). This is in agreement with recent findings that the bc1 complex can produce some superoxide in the presence of the proximal center P inhibitors like myxothiazol, whereas distal center P inhibitors like stigmatellin completely abolish ROS generation (22Muller F.L. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It should be noted that in contrast to recently published results by Kudin et al. (23Kudin A.P. Debska-Vielhaber G. Kunz W.S. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2005; 59: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we did not observe inhibition of the horseradish peroxidase by stigmatellin (not shown). Succinate-dependent ROS generation was negligible in the absence of respiratory chain inhibitors (Fig. 2B) and complex I inhibitors like rotenone (not shown), and the complex II inhibitor malonate (Fig. 2B) had no effect. In contrast, antimycin A markedly stimulated superoxide production (Fig. 2B). We could assign this ROS production unambiguously to the cytochrome bc1 complex, because it was almost fully suppressed by the addition of the center P inhibitor stigmatellin. Unexpectedly, however, succinate-dependent ROS production in the presence of antimycin A was increased more than 3-fold by the complex II inhibitor malonate (Fig. 2B). This increase was abolished by the addition of stigmatellin but was essentially unaffected by the complex I inhibitor rotenone (Fig. 2B) suggesting that still all ROS was produced by center P under these conditions. However, a marked increase of ROS production was observed if approximately 75% of the succinate oxidase activity was inhibited by malonate or oxalacetate, another inhibitor of complex II (Fig. 3). As direct involvement of complex II and reverse electron flow into complex I could be excluded, it seemed that partially oxidizing the ubiquinone pool by limiting its re-reduction by complex II stimulated ROS production by center P of the cytochrome bc1 complex. Maximal ROS Production by the Cytochrome bc1 Complex Is Observed if the Q Pool Is Partially Oxidized—To test whether indeed partial oxidation of the ubiquinone pool stimulated ROS production we next measured the dependence of the ROS production by antimycin-inhibited cytochrome bc1 complex on the ubiquinone/ubiquinol ratio. With DBH the rate of antimycin-induced ROS generation by SMP was much higher than with NADH or succinate as substrates but was also efficiently suppressed by center P inhibitors (Fig. 4A). When we analyzed the intial rates of ROS production with a preset ubiquinol: ubiquinone ratio, we found that the rate of ROS production increased proportionally until a maximal value was reached at about 25-30% ubiquinone (Fig. 4B). This maximal rate was 3 times the rate observed with DBH alone. To exclude any interference from other mitochondrial components, we finally tested whether we could observe the same dependence on the DBQ/DBH ratio with purified lipid-reactivated cytochrome bc1 complex. The presence of detergent resulted in a higher background activity, but still most of the ROS production was abolished by center P inhibitors. The residual rate was consistently somewhat higher with stigmatellin than in the presence of myxothiazol, but this clearly depended on the presence of cytochrome c. We observed an antimycin A-induced increase in superoxide production that was reduced to background levels by center P inhibitors (Fig. 5A). The reduction of the rate by center P inhibitors c indicated that as in SMP the antimycin-related increase was mainly due to superoxide production at the ubiquinol oxidation side. The maximal rates of ∼0.35 H2O2 s-1 or 0.7 O2.¯ s-1 were in good agreement with the antimycin-induced superoxide generation of ∼1 s-1 by purified cytochrome bc1 complexes determined by other groups (22Muller F.L. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Cape J.L. Strahan J.R. Lenaeus M.J. Yuknis B.A. Le T.T. Shepherd J.N. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34654-34660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Sun and Trumpower (26Sun J. Trumpower B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and Forquer et al. (27Forquer I. Covian R. Bowman M.K. Trumpower B.L. Kramer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38459-38465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) found higher rates, but these results might be misleading because the method used by Sun and Trumpower (cytochrome c reduction ± SOD) even gave high rates for the uninhibited complexes from yeast and bovine heart, whereas Forquer et al. used SMPs, in which a contribution of complex I-dependent ROS production to the antimycin-induced rate seems likely (see Fig. 2A). It should be noted that the high cytochrome c concentrations, a known superoxide scavenger, required in this assay also may have lead to some underestimation of the ROS production rates. At any rate, confirming our results with SMP, the antimycin-induced ROS production of purified bc1 complex increased with the DBQ/DBH ratio (Fig. 5B). Again, maximal stimulation of the initial rate was observed at a DBQ content of about 25%. In contrast, a further decrease of the already low basal rate of ROS generation by the uninhibited or myxothiazol-inhibited cytochrome bc1 complex was observed with increasing DBQ concentrations (not shown). Analyzing the mechanism of superoxide formation at center P of the cytochrome bc1 complex is prerequisite for understanding the importance of this reaction in mitochondrial oxidative stress and redox signaling. Here we show that the rate of ROS production by cytochrome bc1 complex is maximal if the ubiquinone pool is partially oxidized. Moving from a fully reduced to a 25% oxidized ubiquinone pool resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in superoxide formation by membrane-bound cytochrome bc1 complex in the presence of the center N inhibitor antimycin A. Consistent with early observations that ROS production in the presence of antimycin A is maximal only in the presence of malonate (28Erecinska M. Wilson D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 174: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we also observed a 3- to 4-fold stimulation of succinate-supported ROS generation if we inhibited >75% complex II activity by the addition of oxalacetate or malonate. We propose that oxidized ubiquinone supports superoxide formation at center P by acting as a redox mediator to transfer electrons from reduced heme bL onto oxygen in a reverse reaction of center P (Fig. 6). This proposal is quite different from the generally assumed mechanism of ROS formation according to which the semiquinone intermediate is the electron donor for oxygen that is formed during normal turnover at center P of the cytochrome bc1 complex. It has to be stressed however that it remains unclear whether ubiquinol oxidation at center P occurs via a sequential mechanism with semiquinone as a true intermediate (12Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or a concerted mechanism avoiding semiquinone formation during normal turnover (10Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Snyder C.H. Gutiérrez-Cirlos E-B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

Nature. 2004; 427: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Recently direct detection of center P semiquinone radicals by EPR spectroscopy in the antimycin-inhibited complex at high pH (16Cape J.L. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7887-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and in cytochrome bc1 complex from a heme bH knock-out mutant (15Zhang H. Osyczka A. Dutton P.L. Moser C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were reported. Although these findings indicate that center P can be tweaked to form and stabilize semiquinone at low occupancy, they do not prove that this semiquinone is a genuine intermediate during normal turnover, nor do they show that it is the reductant for molecular oxygen responsible for superoxide generation of the cytochrome bc1 complex. Although this is conceded by Zhang et al. (15Zhang H. Osyczka A. Dutton P.L. Moser C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), Kramer and colleagues argue that a semiquinone is in fact a transient intermediate during normal turnover that is destabilized under normal conditions to limit ROS generation (16Cape J.L. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7887-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 27Forquer I. Covian R. Bowman M.K. Trumpower B.L. Kramer D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38459-38465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When judging the significance of the finding that a semiquinone can be detected in center P under very special conditions, it should be noted that our results show that the basal rate of ROS production was much higher and the stimulatory effect by oxidized ubiquinone was much less pronounced when we used purified cytochrome bc1 complex (Fig. 5). This may suggest that other mechanisms like the direct electron transfer from a semiquinone onto oxygen may contribute much more to ROS formation in the detergent-solubilized state with less hydrophobic quinone analogues than if the reaction were studied in the native environment of the mitochondrial membrane in the presence of endogenous ubiquinone 10 (Figs. 3 and 4). At any rate, even if a semiquinone intermediate at center P formed during normal turnover may act as a source of electrons for superoxide formation, the occupancy of this state and thereby the resulting rate of ROS production is expected to be significant only under conditions of the so-called “oxidant-induced reduction” (30Wikström M.K.F. Berden J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 283: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), i.e. a highly reduced ubiquinone pool, a largely oxidized downstream respiratory chain, and in the absence of antimycin A, a very high membrane potential. Although such a scenario may be considered for the rather extreme pathological condition, when tissues experience ischemia followed by reperfusion, it is difficult to envision other physiological situations meeting these criteria, especially for the generation of ROS involved in redox signaling. A very high membrane potential for example would inevitably slow down cytochrome c oxidase resulting in a high reduction state for cytochrome c, thus counteracting ROS production at center P by this mechanism. If most of the superoxide would be formed by reverse electron transfer at center P as proposed here, maximal rates of ROS production are expected under quite different conditions, namely with a partially oxidized Q pool to provide sufficient amounts of the mediator and a moderately high membrane potential to increase the fraction of reduced heme bL. This is a physiological scenario that seems much more typical for active mitochondria. Thus it seems likely that in vivo most of the superoxide formation at center P of the cytochrome bc1 complex occurs via the reverse electron mechanism proposed here. In fact, the redox state of the ubiquinone pool varies considerably depending on the organ analyzed over the entire range from mostly oxidized to almost fully reduced (31Aberg F. Appelkvist E.L. Dallner G. Ernster L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) offering an explanation as to why different tissues are affected differentially by mitochondrial ROS production. This is of particular interest because ROS production by the cytochrome bc1 complex has been implicated to play a major role in hypoxia-induced redox signaling and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α stabilization (4Bell E.L. Klimova T.A. Eisenbart J. Moraes C.T. Murphy M.P. Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N.S. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 32Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S.

In organs like lung, brain, and heart, where the ubiquinone pool is normally too oxidized for efficient ROS generation, already moderate oxygen limitation could directly increase the fraction of reduced ubiquinone to the critical level of about 75% ubiquinol. This would result in a burst of ROS production setting off the hypoxia defense signaling cascade, thus providing a mechanism for hypoxia-induced cardiac preconditioning (33Vanden Hoek T.L. Becker L.B. Shao Z. Li C. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18092-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Indeed exposure of rats to systemic mild hypoxia for several hours has been shown to markedly increase the fraction of oxidized ubiquinone (34Galinier A. Carriere A. Fernandez Y. Bessac A.M. Caspar-Bauguil S. Periquet B. Comtat M. Thouvenot J.P. Casteilla L. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A similar adaptive response has also been shown to occur in liver, kidney, and testis, although in these organs the state of ubiquinone reduction is under normal conditions far above the level required for maximal ROS production (34Galinier A. Carriere A. Fernandez Y. Bessac A.M. Caspar-Bauguil S. Periquet B. Comtat M. Thouvenot J.P. Casteilla L. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In these tissues, adaptation could be mediated by regulatory mechanisms acting at the level of cytochrome c oxidase; it has been shown for astrocytes that hypoxia induces a shift between isoform 1 and isoform 2 of subunit IV of cytochrome oxidase abolishing allosteric inhibition by ATP (35Horvat S. Beyer C. Arnold S. J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This could lower the level of ubiquinol reduction to the critical level of approximately 75% ubiquinol, whereas under normal conditions limitation of the electron flow through the respiratory chain at the level of cytochrome c oxidase would keep the ubiquinone pool in a highly reduced state. It follows from these scenarios that it would depend on the Q pool redox state of a given tissue under normal conditions whether the ROS response is induced by increasing or decreasing the fraction of reduced ubiquinone until it reaches the critical level of 75% ubiquinol. Although further studies will be needed to prove and understand theses regulatory scenarios in detail, it seems clear that the proposed mechanism of cytochrome bc1 complex-dependent ROS production via modulation of the redox state of the ubiquinone pool could contribute significantly to the control of mitochondrial redox signaling.

Using multifocal anterior and posterior fossa delivery of sorted fetal human glial progenitor cells into neonatal shiverer × rag2−/− mice, we achieved whole neuraxis myelination of the engrafted hosts, which in a significant fraction of cases rescued this otherwise lethal phenotype. The transplanted mice exhibited greatly prolonged survival with progressive resolution of their neurological deficits. Substantial myelination in multiple regions was accompanied by the acquisition of normal nodes of Ranvier and transcallosal conduction velocities, ultrastructurally normal and complete myelination of most axons, and a restoration of a substantially normal neurological phenotype. Notably, the resultant mice were cerebral chimeras, with murine gray matter but a predominantly human white matter glial composition. These data demonstrate that the neonatal transplantation of human glial progenitor cells can effectively treat disorders of congenital and perinatal hypomyelination. Congenitally hypomyelinated shiverer mice fail to generate compact myelin and die by 18–21 weeks of age. Using multifocal anterior and posterior fossa delivery of sorted fetal human glial progenitor cells into neonatal shiverer × rag2−/− mice, we achieved whole neuraxis myelination of the engrafted hosts, which in a significant fraction of cases rescued this otherwise lethal phenotype.

Our initial study of the efficacy of isolated human glial progenitors revealed no overt effect of cell transplantation on either the condition or fate of the engrafted recipients; despite widespread forebrain myelination, the transplanted mice typically died between 18 and 21 weeks of age, just as did unengrafted shiverers. In the present study, using a newly developed set of approaches to cell acquisition and transplantation, we attempted a far more extensive and higher-density cell engraftment than any previously noted. Our aim in doing so was to achieve sufficiently widespread central myelination so as to influence the phenotype and survival of the recipient animals. To avoid rejection as a complicating variable in these experiments, we crossed shiverers with rag2 null immunodeficient mice (Shinkai et al., 1992Shinkai Y. Rathbun G. Lam K. Oltz E. Stewart V. Mendelsohn M. Charron J. Datta M. Young F. Stall A. RAG2-deficient mice lack mature lymphocytes owing to inability to initiate V(D)J rearrangement.Cell. 1992; 68: 855-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar), and thereby generated an immunodeficient line of congenitally hypomyelinated mice in which to assess graft efficacy and effect. Using these double-homozygous rag2−/− × shiverershi/shi mice, we established a multisite injection protocol, with concurrent bilateral hemispheric and cerebellar cell injections delivered at birth. This procedure resulted in widespread donor cell engraftment throughout the neuraxis, with infiltration of the forebrain, brainstem, and cerebellum, and ultimately the spinal cord and roots. The engrafted human glial progenitor cells exhibited robust, efficient, and functional myelination, with progressive ensheathment of host axons and restoration of normal nodes of Ranvier and attendant conduction velocities. This ultimately led to the high-efficiency myelination of the major intracerebral, ascending, and descending tracts, the cranial nerves and intracranial ganglia, and the spinal cord to the thoracolumbar level. Most notably, the implanted animals exhibited a substantial recovery of normal neurological phenotype, such that a fraction were frankly rescued by perinatal transplantation, surviving well over a year until sacrificed for histology, which revealed a remyelinated—and essentially humanized—central white matter. The neurological recovery and sustained survival of these transplanted mice was in sharp contrast to the fate of their untreated controls, which uniformly died by 5 months of age. To our knowledge, these data represent the first outright rescue of a congenital hypomyelinating disorder by means of a stem or progenitor cell transplantation and indicate that neonatal glial progenitor cell transplantation may prove an effective means of treating disorders of hereditary and perinatal hypomyelination. Newborn double-homozygous shiverer (shi/shi) × rag2−/− immunodeficient mice were implanted with either 300,000 human glial progenitor cells (GPCs; n = 26), with PBS vehicle control (n = 29), or with nothing (n = 59). Cells were delivered at five sites, including the anterior and posterior corpus callosa bilaterally, and the presumptive cerebellar peduncle as a single midline injection; PBS controls received equal volume injections at each site, while the no-injection controls were not injected. The mice were then returned to their mothers and allowed to develop normally, with weaning at 21 days and small-group housing thereafter. All mice were observed to undergo progressive neurological deterioration, typically first manifest by progressive truncal instability, worse upon ambulation, followed with marked hindlimb weakness by 14–16 weeks of age, and seizures beginning at 4–6 weeks but rapidly increasing in frequency by 18–19 weeks. Thus, by 18 weeks, all mice exhibited markedly impaired forward ambulation and frequent episodes of sustained seizures. Over a range of 130–150 days postnatally, all of the 29 PBS treated and 59 untreated control shiverer mice died, with median and mean (±SEM) survivals of 135.0 ± 1.4 and 132.4 ± 2.1 days, respectively. In sharp contrast, of the 26 implanted mice, 20 died during this period, but 6 (23.1%) survived. Whereas the average survival of the untreated controls approximated 130 days, and none of the 88 total control mice survived to 150 days, these 6 implanted mice survived over 160 days, and 4 appeared to have been frankly rescued, surviving over a year before being sacrificed for analysis. Remarkably, these mice exhibited overtly improved neurological function, with decreased seizure incidence and improved mobility and self-care. Transplanted mice surviving beyond 190 days exhibited apparent treatment-dependent cure, with sustained survival over a year, accompanied by a virtually complete recovery of normal neurological phenotype. As a result, the engrafted mice as a group exhibited significantly prolonged survival: Kaplan-Meier analysis (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1999Hosmer D. Lemeshow S. Applied Survival Analysis. John Wiley & Sons, New York1999Google Scholar) confirmed that the treatment-associated improvement in survival was statistically significant, and profoundly so (p = 0.0003; hazard ratio = 0.4718 (95% CI = 0.30–0.70) (Figure 1A). The rescued mice exhibited substantial resolution of their neurological deficits. Shiverer mice typically exhibit truncal instability and marked intention tremor, evident within weeks of birth, which becomes complicated by a progressive hindlimb weakness, and multimodal sensory and perceptual deficits that include blindness, such that by 18–19 weeks of age they are severely impaired (see Movie S1 available online). In addition, they manifest a progressively worsening seizure disorder (Movie S2), often succumbing to status epilepticus. Given the substantially longer survivals noted in a fraction of the transplanted shiverers, we asked what the behavioral concomitants were to transplantation, as a function of time after cell delivery. We were especially interested in any discernible differences in the behavior or neurological status of shiverer mice that were rescued by neonatal GPC transplant, relative to transplanted littermates that nonetheless died. We noted that all of the shiverers, both transplanted and controls, deteriorated identically over the first several months after birth and transplantation. Indeed, up to 130 days, the point at which mice typically began to die in number, little difference was observed in the behaviors of transplanted relative to untransplanted shiverer mice. However, those mice that survived the period spanning 130–150 days postnatally exhibited noticeable improvement in their neurological exams thereafter, frankly manifest by 7–8 months of age as diminished frequency of seizures and improved ambulation, with more forward motion and less retropulsion or freezing. Over the several months thereafter, the transplanted mice incrementally improved, regaining normal fluidity in ambulation and voluntary explorative behavior, and less truncal intention tremor. All five mice surviving to at least 35 weeks of age were substantially normal by that point and thereafter in terms of their grossly assessable neurological function, save for a coarse axial intention tremor, manifesting as a wobble on forward ambulation (Movie S3). Because the death of most mice at 130–150 days of age was coincident with the period of sharply increasing seizure activity, we next assessed the frequency and duration of spontaneous seizures in untreated and transplanted shi/shi × rag2 nulls, as a function of age. We paid special attention to the incidence of seizures in transplanted mice that were rescued by transplant, compared with their treated counterparts that nonetheless succumbed. We found that the first seizures of shiverer mice—typically characterized by absence-like episodes of tonic akinesia, followed by a rapid evolution to brief tonic-clonic events—appeared by 35–42 days of age (Figure 1B). At approximately 120 days, the incidence of seizures was noted to substantially increase in treated and untreated animals alike. Over the period spanning 120–140 days, the seizure incidence of each group increased, yielding frequent seizures every hour (see Figure S1 for a representative EEG recording); these ictal events progressed to sustained periods of status epilepticus, often associated with death. However, in those animals that survived this period to enjoy long-term survival, seizure incidence fell dramatically, such that no seizure activity whatsoever was observed at 12 months (p < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA, separately comparing 12-month transplanted animal seizure incidence to that of 4-month transplanted and control shiverers). Thus, perinatal GPC transplantation was associated with markedly diminished seizure activity in those shi/shi × rag2 null mice that were rescued by perinatal transplantation, such that by a year, none manifested any residual spontaneous seizure activity, while otherwise exhibiting virtually complete neurological recovery. Besides spontaneous seizures, we noted that shiverers exhibited stimulus-evoked seizure activity that increased in both frequency and duration as a function of age. To quantify this pathological response to handling, we established a brief screening test by which mice were briefly and abruptly suspended by the tail, and their behavioral responses observed. We found that such tail suspension was sufficient to induce seizures in a large proportion of shiverer mice, whether treated or not, by 3 months of age. The induction of seizure activity within 30 s of tail suspension was thus chosen as a metric by which to assess the effect of cell transplant on seizure incidence and duration. We observed that among the transplanted shiverers, the percentage of individual tail suspension challenges resulting in clinically overt seizures rose to 75% ± 2.4% by 3–4 months. Among the transplanted mice that survived at least 5 months, 47% ± 2.8% of tail suspension challenges resulted in seizures. In contrast, by 8 months, none of the four surviving mice could be induced to seize by tail suspension. Linear regression of the percentage of mice induced to seize, plotted against their age in days, revealed a best fit of y = −0.324x + 116.7. Regression analysis confirmed that the negative correlation between seizure incidence and age (r = 0.826; r2 = 0.68) was significant (p < 0.0001; F = 53.68 [1, 25 df]) (see Figure S2). Although these data do not yet allow us to causally attribute the sustained survival of these transplanted shiverers to the diminution of their seizure activity, the increased incidence of spontaneous and stimulus-evoked seizures coincident with the period during which most shiverers die, coupled with the diminished seizure incidence of those transplanted survivors that go on to survive (cf. Figures 1B and 1A), suggests that improved seizure control contributes to the sustained viability of the long-surviving transplant recipients. To assess the terminal distribution of donor cells and robustness of myelination in the transplanted animals, and to compare the extent of donor cell dispersal and myelination between short- and long-term survivors, the latter were ultimately sacrificed at 13 months of age, after assessment of their transcallosal conduction velocities and seizure frequency. The brains and spinal cords of these mice were then analyzed in terms of donor cell distribution and density; myelin production and the proportion of myelinated axons; nodal architecture and reconstitution; and ultrastructural metrics, including myelinated axons and myelin G ratios. Each of these metrics was then compared to those obtained from transplanted mice that had died earlier, as well as to unimplanted shiverer controls and wild-type, normally myelinated, rag2 null mice. These histological data supported the compelling nature of the survival data. Human donor-cell engraftment was extraordinarily extensive, with essentially whole neuraxis penetration and colonization by the human GPCs (Figure 2A). High donor-cell densities were observed throughout the forebrain, cerebellum, brainstem, and cervical spinal cord, diminishing only at the level of the thoracolumbar cord, yet increasing again in the sacral cord and conus medullaris. The pattern of myelination, as indicated by MBP expression, reflected this widespread engraftment, with equally widespread and dense myelination (Figures 2B–2F), including not only all major central white matter tracts but also structures as distant and diverse as the cranial ganglia, optic chiasm, and conus medullaris (e.g., Figure 2G). These long-term survivors, whose neurological exams had largely normalized by 9 months of age, exhibited essentially complete myelination of the brain, brainstem, and cerebellum, with substantial myelination of the optic nerves (Figure 2B), spinal cord (Figure 2E), and spinal roots (Figure 2G), as well as of the cranial roots and ganglia (Figures 3A–3C). In regards to the latter, the cessation of donor GPC migration at the border of CNS and PNS was striking, such that donor-derived myelination occurred up to, but not beyond, the transition points demarcating central ganglia and roots from peripheral nerve (Figures 3A–3E). The resultant densities and patterns of donor cell dispersal resulted in the virtually complete chimerization of the murine hosts' central nervous systems, which thereby acquired a largely humanized white matter. Three-dimensional reconstructions confirmed that both the pattern and density of donor-derived myelination in the brains of transplanted shiverers approximated that of wild-type, normal mice.Figure 3Transplanted GPCs Invade the Cranial and Spinal Roots but Obey the CNS-PNS BorderShow full captionTransplanted mice exhibited robust myelination throughout the entire CNS neuraxis by 9 months of age, that included not only the brain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord, but also the cranial nerves, ganglia, and both cranial and spinal roots (see Figure 2, Figure 4).

We next asked if donor cell-derived myelination of shiverer axons was accompanied by the acquisition of normal nodes of Ranvier and paranodal structure (Figures 4A–4D). Using high-resolution confocal imaging of the corpus callosa, cervical spinal cords, and optic nerves of implanted shiverers killed at 35 or 52 weeks of age, we assessed the distribution pattern of the paranodal and juxtaparanodal proteins Caspr and the KV1.2 voltage-gated potassium channel, respectively—the contiguous interaction of which characterizes the normal node of Ranvier (Rasband and Trimmer, 2001Rasband M.N.

Rasband M.N. Glial regulation of the axonal membrane at nodes of Ranvier.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These potassium channels are assembled at—and functionally define—the juxtaparanodes in myelinated axons, but they are broadly and nonspecifically expressed in unmyelinated fibers (Rasband and Trimmer, 2001Rasband M.N. Trimmer J.S. Developmental clustering of ion channels at and near the node of Ranvier.Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, we determined the axonal expression and compartmentalization of NaV1.6 fast sodium channels, which are typically sequestered at nodes of Ranvier in intact myelinated axons but dispersed broadly along unmyelinated or dysmyelinated fibers. Similarly, we immunostained for βIV spectrin, which couples to ankyrin to organize fast sodium channels at the node of Ranvier, and hence typically coincides with nodal Nav1.6 expression (Schafer and Rasband, 2006Schafer D.P.

Rasband M. βIV spectrin is recruited to axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier by ankyrinG.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Using these complementary nodal markers, we identified an essentially normal organization of the nodes of Ranvier in transplanted mice, which was indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice. Caspr and KV1.2 were expressed in organized paranodal and juxtaparanodal apposition, with an expression pattern that contrasted sharply with the grossly uncoordinated pattern of diffuse Caspr and KV1.2 immunolabeling that was evident in the untransplanted controls (Figures 4A–4D). Similarly, both NaV1.6 (Figures 4A″–4D′) and βIV spectrin (Figures 4A″–4D″) clearly identified nodes of Ranvier in the transplanted shi/shi mice, flanked by Caspr defining the paranodes; their untransplanted controls showed no such sequestration of either NaV1.6 or βIV spectrin expression. Together, these observations suggest that despite interspecies chimerization, the glioaxonal interactions of human GPC-derived oligodendrocytes with host mouse axons were functionally appropriate. More broadly, they indicate that GPC-derived oligodendrocytes are able to communicate effectively with host axons, organizing structurally appropriate nodes of Ranvier while sequestering fast sodium channels within the nodes, and thereby myelinating their axonal substrates effectively and appropriately. In light of the apparent histological reconstitution of normal myelin, we next asked if donor OPC-derived myelin was sufficient in extent and functional competence to restore the conduction speed of newly myelinated central axons. To this end, we assessed the conduction velocity across the corpus callosum in a sample of four long-surviving transplanted shiverer mice 12–13 months after neonatal xenograft. The transcallosal nerve conduction velocities were determined by recording response amplitudes and times from depth electrodes placed bilaterally in the corpus callosa of each of these mice, after contralateral stimulation at symmetric sites during open craniotomy. Equal numbers of age-matched wild-type (congenic C3H) mice and rag2 null controls were assessed identically, as was a necessarily younger (4 months old) sample of untransplanted shiverer × rag2 null mice. As this was a terminal procedure, these animals—all of which had exhibited not only sustained survival but also a substantial restoration of normal neurological function—were sacrificed after measurement of their transcallosal conduction velocities, thus ending the survival study in which they were subjects. We found that though control Fvb wild-type (n = 3) and rag2 null C3H mice (n = 4) exhibited conduction velocities of 0.324 ± 0.01 and 0.328 ± 0.03 m/sec respectively, the shiverer × rag2 mice (n = 4), also on the C3H background, exhibited substantially slower conduction, at 0.260 ± 0.02 m/sec (Figure 4E). In contrast, transplanted shiverer × rag2−/− mice, tested just prior to sacrifice 12–13 months posttransplant (n = 3), had an average conduction velocity of 0.330 ± 0.01 m/sec. Repeated-measures ANOVA with post hoc Boneferroni t tests revealed a significant treatment effect (F = 35.15 [3, 9 df]), such that callosal conduction by the transplanted mice was significantly faster than untransplanted shiverer × rag2−/− mice (p < 0.001), and indistinguishable from that of normally myelinated Fvb wild-type and rag2 null mice. The more rapid transcallosal conduction exhibited by the transplanted mice was sustained across stimulus intensities, and thus appeared to represent improved conduction across a wide spectrum of fiber diameters (Figure 4F). Thus, neonatal transplantation of human OPCs yielded sufficient myelin, in terms of both density and physiological competence, to restore normal interhemispheric conduction velocity to a major central tract, the corpus callosum. We had previously established that the dispersal of donor cells following neonatal implantation of human GPCs was relatively rapid, with the terminal distributions of engrafted progenitors occurring within 4–8 weeks of neonatal administration, and myelination proceeding over the several months thereafter (Windrem et al., 2004Windrem M.S.

In the present study, given the extended survival of mice transplanted both in brain and brainstem, we were able to assess the later progression of myelination in the graft recipients. We asked whether myelination continued to progress even after extended survival had been achieved. To that end, we examined the brains of transplanted shiverers at 18–20 (n = 10), 27 (n = 1), 35 (n = 1), and 52–56 (n = 4) weeks of age, and assessed the distribution pattern and densities of h"

An emerging view is that a core set of transcription factors, including Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, form a robust autoregulatory circuit that maintains ESCs in a self-renewing state. To accommodate the capacity of such cells to undergo germ layer-specific differentiation, we predicted a posttranslational mechanism that could negatively regulate these core self-renewal factors. Here we report caspase-induced cleavage of Nanog in differentiating ESCs. Stem cells lacking the Casp3 gene showed marked defects in differentiation, while forced expression of a caspase cleavage-resistant Nanog mutant in ESCs strongly promoted self-renewal.

Thus, ESCs depend only marginally on mitogenic stimuli typically required for somatic cells to proliferate but stimulate their own growth through endogenous factors. This autonomy is best shown by the unique ability of ESCs, injected into virtually any anatomical site in adult animals, to form rapidly growing tumors called teratocarcinomas (Damjanov and Solter, 1974Damjanov I. Solter D. Experimental teratoma.Curr. Top. Pathol. 1974; 59: 69-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). How, then, do ESCs retain the capacity for rapid differentiation? The most plausible mechanism, in our view, would modify one or more core transcription factors posttranslationally, allowing the ESCs to rapidly escape the constraints of their self-renewal machinery. Attractive candidates for the role of posttranslational modifier of ESC function are the site-specific proteases of the programmed cell death system (Earnshaw et al., 1999Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M.

Caspases: Enemies within.Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6018) Google Scholar). The cysteine protease Caspase-3 is especially notable because it not only cleaves vital proteins, but also activates other caspases, such as Caspase-9, that have their own targets. These proteases are very specific for particular amino acid sequences, are highly regulated in their activities, and, in some contexts, appear to influence the decision of cells to differentiate (Arama et al., 2003Arama E.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), implying functions other than the execution of cell-death programs. Here we report that caspases play a critical role in ESC differentiation by negatively regulating the self-renewal machinery of these stem cells. We first tested differentiating mouse ESC cultures for the presence of caspase activity. As shown in Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online, such activity began to increase very shortly after the ESCs were stimulated with retinoic acid (RA) or plated in differentiation medium. To exclude an effect from increased apoptosis, we assayed the cultures for the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis, demonstrating essentially no increases in this end point over 72 hr poststimulation with RA (Figure 1B). To substantiate that the caspase activity peaks were associated with cell differentiation and not programmed cell death, we generated a caspase activity reporter cell line (Caspsensor; Figure S2A) in which enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) could be seen in the cytoplasm as long as caspase activity was low or absent but appeared in the nucleus when caspases were active (Figure 1C). In their undifferentiated state, the ESCs showed mainly cytoplasmic EYFP staining, but upon induction of differentiation, the EYFP signal shifted to the nucleus in most or an increased percentage of the ESCs (Figures 1C–1D), indicating the presence of caspase activity. Importantly, none of the caspase-positive cells appeared to be undergoing programmed cell death, as they lacked the classical features of nuclear condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and membrane blebbing (data not shown). Western blot analysis revealed marked differences in the sizes of the EYFPs, indicating that the reporter protein had indeed been cleaved by caspases (Figure S2B). We attribute the slight discrepancy in the kinetics of caspase activity shown in Figures 1A and 1D to the different cell densities required for the respective assays. Finally, we asked if PARP-1, a recognized caspase target during the execution of apoptosis (Lazebnik et al., 1994Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by a proteinase with properties like ICE.Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar), might also be cleaved after induction of differentiation. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy with PARP-1 antibodies revealed what appeared to be cleaved PARP-1 (the p85 fragment) at 48 hr poststimulation of ESCs (Figures 1E and 1F), suggesting that, as in cells undergoing apoptosis, PARP-1 was also cleaved by caspases during differentiation. Thus, differentiating ESCs show increased caspase activity that is not associated with programmed cell death. Because many different caspases could have accounted for the increases in caspase activity seen in our differentiating ESC cultures, we performed a western blot analysis for active caspases in protein lysates from these cultures. Using antibodies against five major caspases, we identified active Caspase-3 in the lysates (Figure 2A) but failed to detect other effector cysteine proteases (data not shown). To demonstrate the functional relevance of Caspase-3 to ESC differentiation, we first exposed the cells to the caspase-blocking peptide VAD and induced differentiation with RA. This treatment clearly inhibited ESC differentiation, although the block was not complete (Figures 2B and 2D, left). Thus, while important for differentiation, Caspase-3 activity may not have been the sole factor contributing to this process. Alternatively, the VAD peptide may not have fully inactivated the protease. To substantiate a requirement for Caspase-3 activity in ESC differentiation, we generated both homozygous and heterozygous lines of Casp3 knockout ESCs (Figure S3A). Deletion of the Casp3 locus lacked any discernible effect in undifferentiated ESCs; however, when exposed to RA, the Casp3−/− ESCs showed an obvious delay in differentiation compared with Casp3+/− cells (Figures 2C and 2D, right). Similar results were obtained when the ESCs were induced to differentiate as embryoid bodies (Figure S3B). As in the caspase blocking experiment, more than 25% of the Casp3−/− ESC colonies showed appreciable signs of differentiation after 5 days, while a substantial proportion of the colonies remained either completely undifferentiated (42%) or only partially differentiated (31%). Quantification of Oct4 expression in Casp3−/− ESCs by PCR (Figure S3C and S3D) showed a reduction in this transcription factor with time after differentiation, reinforcing the idea that a differentiation delay is associated with the absence of this protease in ESCs. We also injected Casp3+/− and Casp3−/− ESCs into immunocompromised mice, observing tumor formation at the injection sites 10–14 days later in both experimental groups. Histological examination of the tumors revealed differentiated cells from all germ layers in mice injected with the Casp3+/− ESCs, in contrast to the mainly undifferentiated or immature cells in Casp3−/− ESCs (Figure 2E; Figure S4). Taken together, the caspase-blocking and Casp3 knockout data support direct involvement of Caspase-3 in ESC differentiation. If Caspase-3 indeed promotes the differentiation of ESCs, it should be possible to demonstrate this effect by modulating levels of the active protease. We therefore made targeted insertions of cDNAs encoding a constitutively active (Casp3rev) or mutated (mCasp3rev) form of Caspase-3 upstream of the HPRT locus of A2lox ESCs; these cDNAs were under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Figure S5A). Doxycycline induction of higher levels of inducible Caspase-3 in ESCs stimulated differentiation, coinciding with a reduction of Nanog and Oct4 levels, an increase in the expression of miscellaneous differentiation factors, and an obvious change in cell morphology associated with differentiation (Figures 3A–3C). Whether such stimulation favors differentiation to a particular cell type (e.g., endoderm) or simply releases ESCs from the self-renewal machinery to be stimulated by other extrinsic or intrinsic signals required for cell-fate commitment is unclear. To identify the differentiation-specific molecular targets of Caspase-3 in mouse ESCs, we developed an in vitro Caspase-3 cleavage assay and used it to determine the cleavage of Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog transcription factors, all of which maintain ESCs in a self-renewing state. Caspase-3 cleaved human (h) Nanog in vitro (Figure 4A), while Sox2 and Oct4 remained uncleaved (data not shown). Examination of the hNanog amino acid sequence revealed conserved residues at position 69 and at position 70 between the N-terminal transcriptional transactivator (Pan and Pei, 2003Pan G.J. Pei D.Q. Identification of two distinct transactivation domains in the pluripotency sustaining factor nanog.Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the homeodomain (Figure 4A) that likely serve as the Caspase-3 cleavage site. Indeed, when a single amino acid in this putative recognition sequence was mutated (yielding D69E hNanog), Caspase-3 was no longer able to cleave the protein in vitro (Figure 4A). We also noted that mouse (m) Nanog has a single amino acid substitution (D > G) at position 64 that is three bases upstream of the Caspase-3 cleavage site, a modification that could decrease the ability of Caspase-3 to cleave mNanog. An in vitro Caspase-3 substrate affinity assay revealed that the cleavage site in mNanog (GSPD) was still targeted by Caspase-3 (Figure S6B). However, after performing the same in vitro cleavage assays as used with hNanog, we observed very little or no cleavage of recombinant mNanog by Caspase-3 (Figure S6A). To determine whether both hNanog and mNanog and their corresponding mutants are cleaved in differentiating ESCs in vivo, we studied all four constructs in ESCs treated with RA (Figure 4B). Western blot analysis revealed cleavage of both wild-type hNanog and wild-type mNanog, but not their mutant forms harboring modified caspase cleavage sites (aa 67 to 68 in mNanog and aa 69 to 70 in hNanog) (Figure 4B). In addition, western blot analysis with antibodies against endogenous Nanog detected a smaller band at 24 and 36 hr postinduction that corresponded to the cleaved form of Nanog (Figure 4C). Thus, given the apparently reduced activity of Caspase-3 toward mNanog in vitro compared with its effective cleavage of this transcription factor in vivo, we hypothesized that another, Caspase-3-dependent protease may function with Caspase-3 to modify the regulatory activity of mNanog. By screening a panel of caspases for their ability to cleave mNanog in vitro (Figure 4D, left), we identified Caspase-9 as the most likely candidate for this role (Figure 4D; Figure S6C). Indeed, others have shown that the activity of Caspase-9 can be drastically enhanced either by active Caspase-3 (Zou et al., 2003Zou H. Yang R. Hao J. Wang J. Sun C. Fesik S.W. Wu J.C. Tomaselli K.K. Armstrong R.C. Regulation of the Apaf-1/Caspase-9 Apoptosome by Caspase-3 and XIAP.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8092-8098Google Scholar) or by Procaspase-3 (Yin et al., 2006Yin Q. Park H.O. Chung J.Y. Lin S.-C. Lo Y.-C. da Graca L.S. Jiang X. Wu H. Caspase-9 Holoenzyme Is a Specific and Optimal Procaspase-3 processing Machine.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), supporting an important contribution of Caspase-9 to Nanog cleavage in ESCs. If Nanog is indeed one of the principal targets of Caspases in ESCs, its cleavage should have profound effects on whether the cells remain in a state of pluripotency or differentiate. To test this prediction, we again generated ESCs harboring cDNA coding for hNanog or D69E, the caspase cleavage-resistant form of hNanog targeted upstream of the HPRT locus under the control of a tetracycline-inducible element (Figures S7A and S7B). Importantly, the expression of induced hNanog reached levels comparable to those of endogenous Nanog (Figure S7C). ESCs expressing the D69E form of hNanog had a clear proliferative advantage over cells with the wild-type allele when cultured under conditions that promote differentiation (Figures 4E and 4F). They also lacked evidence of morphological changes, in contrast to ESCs carrying the wild-type form of Nanog (Figure S7D). To assess the antidifferentiation effects of caspase cleavage mNanog, we plated ESCs transfected with wild-type and D67G (cleavage-resistant) mNanog at clonal densities and analyzed colony formation 3 days later. The vast majority of colonies expressing the cleavage-resistant form of mNanog appeared morphologically unaffected and were positive for alkaline phosphatase, whereas a significantly lower number of colonies expressing wild-type mNanog consisted of undifferentiated, alkaline phosphatase-positive cells (Figure 4G). These observations support the hypothesis that caspase-mediated cleavage of Nanog promotes ESC differentiation. Our findings suggest that ESCs exploit caspases for rapid and specific deactivation of Nanog, thus disrupting the autoregulatory circuit that otherwise preserves pluripotency in these cells. They indicate further that Caspase-3 plays a dominant role in this negative regulation by acting directly on Nanog or interacting as a cofactor with Caspase-9, which then deactivates the transcription factor. The action of caspases on Nanog appears to separate the N-terminal domain from the homeodomain, leading to the destabilization and subsequent degradation of the protein. From our experiments, it is clear that both human and mouse Nanog are cleaved by caspases, and therefore, it is likely that both of them are completely interchangeable with regard to caspase-mediated cleavage during the differentiation of ESCs. That the caspase cleavage-resistant forms of Nanog have a significantly stronger antidifferentiation effect in ESCs than does wild-type Nanog firmly suggests that caspase-mediated cleavage of endogenous Nanog plays a critical role in ESC differentiation. The link we have identified between ESC differentiation and programmed cell death helps to explain several poorly understood observations on these ostensibly distinct processes, both in vitro and in the early embryo. For instance, some components of the cell-death system, such as Bcl-2, protect ESCs not only from apoptosis but also from differentiation (Yamane et al., 2005Yamane T. Dylla S.J. Muijtjens M. Weissman I.L. Enforced Bcl-2 expression overrides serum and feeder cell requirements for mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), while p53 has been shown to be directly involved in both the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis and the differentiation of ESCs (Lin et al., 2005Lin T. Chao C. Saito S. Mazur S.J. Murphy M.E. Appella E. Xu Y. p53 induces differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells by suppressing Nanog expression.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Moreover, other proteolytic components of ESCs, such as the proteasome, appear to have direct roles in the control of stem cell self-renewal (Szutorisz et al., 2006Szutorisz H. Georgiou A. Tora L. Dillon N. The proteasome restricts permissive transcription at tissue-specific gene loci in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 127: 1375-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Future studies will need to address the question of whether caspase activity indeed actively promotes differentiation, as our data suggest, or perhaps functions as part of a mechanism for the selective elimination of undifferentiated cells. In either case, the net outcome—cell differentiation—would be the same. Selective targeting of Nanog by caspases is consistent with evidence implicating this transcription factor as a “master” regulator of the pluripotent state (Chambers et al., 2003Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A.

However, given the remarkable complexity of the pathways controlling cell death and differentiation, we find it difficult to imagine how Caspase-3, acting alone or in collaboration with Caspase-9, could be solely responsible for the mediation of proliferation versus differentiation choices in ESCs. We predict, instead, that other mediators of cell death participate in this critical developmental transition, possibly by targeting pluripotency factors other than Nanog. This hypothesis is supported by the absence of any overt phenotype in the preimplantation embryos of Casp3 knockout mice (Kuida et al., 1996Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H.

Kaufman S.A. et al.Essential contribution of caspase-3/CPP32 to apoptosis and iys associated nuclear changes.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Our results leave unanswered the major question of why Caspase-3 activation during differentiation is limited and does not self-amplify as seen during apoptosis. Potential mechanisms for such control of caspase activity include subcellular localization of the enzyme, the caspase activity level itself, phosphorylation or other forms of structural modification, as well as direct or indirect interaction with protein inhibitors, such as IAPs. Given that ESCs carrying the cleavage-resistant form of Nanog proliferate better than those with the wild-type allele, it seems reasonable to suggest that the cleaved form of Nanog might exert a dominant-negative effect on some of the normal functions of Nanog. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathways controlling ESC self-renewal and differentiation, in particular the apparent molecular link between programmed cell death and cell differentiation, would not only accelerate efforts to generate clinically relevant cell types from ESCs but may also facilitate the reprogramming of differentiated cells to enter a pluripotent state (Okita et al., 2007Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Generation of germline-competent induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3359) Google Scholar), (Silva et al., 2006Silva J. Chambers I. Pollard S. Smith A. Nanog promotes transfer of pluripotency after cell fusion.Nature. 2006; 441: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), for example, by blocking caspase activity. We consider the affinity of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 for the transcription factor Nanog to be a paradigm for other potential caspase targets in ESCs; hence, it should be possible to exploit the caspases in experimental screens to identify other factors that regulate stem cell pluripotency. Finally, the involvement of caspases in nonapoptotic pathways, as demonstrated here and elsewhere (Arama et al., 2003Arama E. Agapite J. Steller H.

The mouse ESC lines used were as follows: D3 (from ATCC, no. CRL11632), R1 (from Andras Nagy, Toronto), and E14Tg2a-derived A2lox (from Michael Kyba, UT Southwestern Medical Center) Cells were typically used between passages 10 and 20. A2lox ESCs express the reverse tetracycline transactivator from the endogenous Rosa26 locus and carry an insertion containing a tetracycline response element, loxP-lox2272 sites and the neomycinΔATG-resistance gene upstream of HPRT on the X chromosome. To generate inducible derivatives, we subcloned cDNAs into the p2Lox targeting vector. Cre/Lox recombination was used to insert p2Lox into the inducible locus as described previously (Kyba et al., 2003Kyba M. Perlingeiro R.C. Hoover R.R. Lu C.W. Pierce J. Daley G.Q.

The medium contained 10% FBS (Innovative Research, cat. no. IFBF-H) tested for toxicity to ESCs in a colony-forming assay (Evans, 2004Evans M. Isolation and Maintenance of Murine Embryonic Stem Cells.in: Lanza R. Handbook of Stem Cells. Elsevier Academic Press, Burlington2004: 413-417Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) that included Knockout DMEM (Invitrogen, cat. no. 10829-018), 1x nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen, cat. no. 111140-050), L-glutamine 1% v/v (Invitrogen, cat. no. 25030-081), 2-mercaptoethanol (3.5 μl per 250 ml medium; Sigma, cat. no. M7522), LIF 1000 per ml (Esgro, cat. no. ESG1107). Cells were routinely maintained on irradiated (8400 rad) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from E14.5-old embryos (mouse strain CF1, Charles River timed pregnant mice). For some experiments, ESCs were placed onto 0.1% gelatin type A (Sigma, cat. no. G1890)-coated dishes and passaged 2 to 4 times before the experiment was carried out. For differentiation studies, standard medium was replaced with medium containing 1 μM retinoic acid (RA, Sigma, cat. no. R2625) without LIF or N2B27 medium (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Conversion of embryonic stem cells into neuroectodermal precursors in adherent monoculture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Trypsinized ESCs (R1, 200,000; D3, 250,000) were plated into 6 wells containing normal ESC medium, and on the next day, the medium was changed to 1 μM RA differentiation medium. Cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen, cat. no. 25300-054), and protein extracts were made in 0.1% CHAPS buffer, pH 7.2 (50 mM HEPES; 150 mM KCl; 1x protease inhibitors [Roche, cat. no. 1697498001]); 2 mM Na fluoride, and orthovanadate, respectively, at specified time points. The CaspGlo (Promega, cat. no. G8091) kit was used to directly measure caspase activity. Before determining caspase activity, we tested the system for variability within the dynamic range using recombinant caspase-3 (BD Bioscience, cat. no. 556471). The signal was measured with the Wallac 1429 VictorII instrument (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA). ESCs were derived from E3.5-old mouse embryos. Briefly on day 1, caspase-3 homozygous (Kuida et al., 1996Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A.

Forty-six hours later, the female mice received an i.p. injection of 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG; Calbiochem, cat. no. 230734). Stimulated females were placed into a cage with 8-week-old caspase-3-homozygous stud males. Blastocysts were collected on day 3 postcoitum in the afternoon. The blastocysts were placed onto irradiated mouse embryonic feeder cells and incubated for 3 days in ESC medium, trypsinized, and replated. Colonies apparent on day 7 were picked, expanded, and genotyped with use of the following primers: mCasp3-S, TGTCATCTCGCTCTGGTACG; mCasp3-AS, CCCTTTCTGCCTGTCTTCTG (PCR product SIZE 310 bp); Neomycin-S, AGACAATCGGCTGCTCTGAT; Neomycin-AS, ATACTTTCTCGGCAGGAGCA (PCR product size 260 bp); mOct4-S, GGCGTTCTCTTTGGAAAGGTGTTC; mOct4-AS, CTCGAACCACATCCTTCTCT (PCR product size 312 bp); Actin-S, GGCCCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTATCC, Actin-AS, ACGCACGATTTCCCTCTCAGC (PCR product size 460 bp). For PCR, we used GoTaq green master mix (Promega, cat. no. M7112) with the following program: 1 cycle at 95°C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles with 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30, and 72°C for 30 sec for 30 s followed by one extension of 10 min at 72°C. We generated two caspase-3 knockout cell lines (34A and 34B) and two control caspase-3 heterozygote cell line (22A and 22B). All experiments were carried out with these four cell lines and yielded essentially the same results. We used a constitutively active caspase-3 gene (Casp3rev) as described in Srinivasula et al., 1998Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. MacFarlane M. Luo Z. Huang Z. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S.

The caspase-3 inserts were cut out of their backbone vectors with EcoRI, and the insert (874 bp) was cloned by blunt end ligation into the pLoxP2 vector and digested with XhoI-SmaI (3549 bp). The vector was coelectroporated with pSalk-Cre into 30 × 106 A172 cells (960 μF, 25 millisec pulse). After electroporation, the cells were selected with G418 (400 μg/ml), and individual clones were picked and subsequently expanded. For the differentiation experiment, cells were plated into 6-well plates (1 × 105/well) and stimulated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma, cat. no. D9891) for 36 hr. They were then harvested, and western blots for Oct4 (H-134 Santa Cruz, cat. no. SC9081), Nanog (Abcam, cat. no. AB14959; Chemicon 1/1000), and beta-tubulin (D10; Santa Cruz, cat. no. SC5274) were performed. Secondary antibodies (dilutions 1/5000 and 1/10000) consist of Alexa-680 antirabbit (Molecular Probes, cat. no. A21077) or IRday 800 antirabbit (Rockland, cat. no. 611-131-121). The signal was detected with the Odyssey system. Human Nanog was obtained from ATCC (cDNA clone cat. no. 10806397; Image Clone IDm no. 40004923; Gene Bank ID no. BC09827) and subcloned into pCR-BlendII-TOPO (Invitrogen). The mutation D69E was introduced into human hNanog with a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Quickchange II, Stratagene). Sequencing of both clones confirmed the identity of the human Nanog cDNA wild-type (TOPOT-Nanog) and D69E mutation (TOPO-mut -Nanog). In vitro transcription and translation were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, cat. no. L520A). TOPO-Nanog and TOPO-D69E-Nanog plasmid 1 μg was incubated at 30°C with T7 quick master mix and 1 mM methionine plus biotin-tRNA (Promega, cat. no. L506A) in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was stopped after 90 min, and aliquots frozen at −80 C°. Biotin-labeled human hNanog and D69E-Nanog were detected after transfer to nitrocellulose membranes with streptavidin Alexa fluor 680− (Molecular Probes, cat. no. S21378, dilution 1/10000). Protein was digested with 40 ng recombinant active caspase-3 (BD Bioscience, cat. no. 51-66281V) in a total volume of 15 μl at pH 7.5 (6 mM Tris-Cl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, and 1.5 mM MgCl2) (Laugwitz et al., 2001Laugwitz K.L.

Gene Ther. 2001; 12: 2051-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reaction product was run on 4%–20% gradient PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), and protein was detected as previously described (streptavidin, Alexa Fluor 680 Odyssey system, LI-COR). Nanog and D69E-Nanog clones were plated at a density of 5000 cells into 96-well plates, incubated overnight, and then stimulated with RA for specified times. Cells were then pulsed with methyl-3H thymidine (Perkin Elmer, NET027) for 3 hr and harvested (Packard Filtermate harvester), and scintillation counts were measured with the Packard Topocount-NXT Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter. The inducible cell lines Nanog, D69E mutated Nanog, EGFP, and control A172 were plated and incubated over night with 1 μM doxycycline. The Nanog inducible, D69E Nanog and A172 ESC lines were mixed with the EGFP inducible cell line in a ratio of 20:80 and plated on the next day. Cells were maintained in ESC medium without LIF. The percentage of EGFP-positive cells was determined with a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson) on days 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 after plating.

https://openalex.org/W2135652919,"Circulating stem cells of different origin have been demonstrated to improve repair of various organs both after systemic and local application, although the mechanisms that cause these effects are still not fully understood. We have used a combination of DNA microarray analysis and in vitro migration assays to screen for molecules that mediate homing of long-term renewing adult bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MASCs). We show that the cytokine receptor CCR2 is necessary for organ-specific homing of bone marrow-derived MASCs to the heart in a transgenic mouse model and into hearts damaged by ischemia/reperfusion. Homing and migration of stem cells was dependent on the intracellular adaptor molecule FROUNT, which interacts with CCR2. FROUNT was required for polarization of MASCs, resulting in clustering of CCR2 and reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Recruited MASCs summoned by the CCR2 ligand MCP-1/CCL2 expressed SDF1, which might trap additional bone marrow-derived circulating cells to contribute to the complex process of homing and retention of circulating stem and progenitor cells to remodel diseased organs."
https://openalex.org/W1994219607,"High-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical libraries has become a critical tool in basic biology and drug discovery. However, its implementation and the adaptation of high-content assays to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been hampered by multiple technical challenges. Here we present a strategy to adapt hESCs to HTS conditions, resulting in an assay suitable for the discovery of small molecules that drive hESC self-renewal or differentiation. Use of this new assay has led to the identification of several marketed drugs and natural compounds promoting short-term hESC maintenance and compounds directing early lineage choice during differentiation. Global gene expression analysis upon drug treatment defines known and novel pathways correlated to hESC self-renewal and differentiation. Our results demonstrate feasibility of hESC-based HTS and enhance the repertoire of chemical compounds for manipulating hESC fate. The availability of high-content assays should accelerate progress in basic and translational hESC biology."
https://openalex.org/W1966895787,"Radiation is one of the most effective cancer treatments. However, gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome is a major limiting factor in abdominal and pelvic radiotherapy. The loss of crypt stem cells or villus endothelial cells has been suggested to be responsible for radiation-induced intestinal damage. We report here a critical role of the BH3-only protein p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) in the radiosensitivity of intestinal epithelium and pathogenesis of GI syndrome. PUMA was induced in a p53-dependent manner and mediated radiation-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in the intestinal mucosa. PUMA-deficient mice exhibited blocked apoptosis in the intestinal progenitor and stem cells, enhanced crypt proliferation and regeneration, and prolonged survival following lethal doses of radiation. Unexpectedly, PUMA deficiency had little effect on radiation-induced intestinal endothelial apoptosis. Suppressing PUMA expression by antisense oligonucleotides provided significant intestinal radioprotection. Therefore, PUMA-mediated apoptosis in the progenitor and stem cell compartments is crucial for radiation-induced intestinal damage."
https://openalex.org/W2066337690,"Malaria continues to be a devastating parasitic disease that causes the death of 2 million individuals annually. The increase in multi-drug resistance together with the absence of an efficient vaccine hastens the need for speedy and comprehensive antimalarial drug discovery and development. Throughout history, traditional herbal remedies or natural products have been a reliable source of antimalarial agents, e.g. quinine and artemisinin. Today, one emerging source of small molecule drug leads is the world's oceans. Included among the source of marine natural products are marine microorganisms such as the recently described actinomycete. Members of the genus Salinispora have yielded a wealth of new secondary metabolites including salinosporamide A, a molecule currently advancing through clinical trials as an anticancer agent. Because of the biological activity of metabolites being isolated from marine microorganisms, our group became interested in exploring the potential efficacy of these compounds against the malaria parasite.We screened 80 bacterial crude extracts for their activity against malaria growth. We established that the pure compound, salinosporamide A, produced by the marine actinomycete, Salinispora tropica, shows strong inhibitory activity against the erythrocytic stages of the parasite cycle. Biochemical experiments support the likely inhibition of the parasite 20S proteasome. Crystal structure modeling of salinosporamide A and the parasite catalytic 20S subunit further confirm this hypothesis. Ultimately we showed that salinosporamide A protected mice against deadly malaria infection when administered at an extremely low dosage.These findings underline the potential of secondary metabolites, derived from marine microorganisms, to inhibit Plasmodium growth. More specifically, we highlight the effect of proteasome inhibitors such as salinosporamide A on in vitro and in vivo parasite development. Salinosporamide A (NPI-0052) now being advanced to phase I trials for the treatment of refractory multiple myeloma will need to be further explored to evaluate the safety profile for its use against malaria."

Like protein phosphatases, OGT appears to be targeted to myriad specific substrates by transiently interacting with specific targeting subunits. Here, we show that OGT is activated by insulin signaling. Insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulates both tyrosine phosphorylation and catalytic activity of OGT. A subset of OGT co-immunoprecipitates with the insulin receptor. Insulin stimulates purified insulin receptor to phosphorylate OGT in vitro. OGT is a competitive substrate with reduced and carboxyamidomethylated lysozyme (RCAM-lysozyme), a well characterized insulin receptor substrate. Insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes results in a partial translocation of OGT from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The insulin activation of OGT results in increased O-GlcNAc modification of OGT and other proteins including, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).

O-GlcNAc is on myriad proteins and cycles like phosphorylation. On several proteins, O-GlcNAc is attached at or adjacent to phosphorylation sites, suggesting that the saccharide also plays a competitive role in cell signaling pathways (3Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 599-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc attachment and detachment (cycling) is mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAc specific β-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase), respectively (4Kreppel L.K.

Unlike phosphorylation, which is orchestrated by hundreds of kinases, in mammals, there is predominantly only the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of OGT and a few other isoforms that result from alternative promoter usage and splicing of a single gene (4Kreppel L.K.

Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), protein interactions, and post-translational modifications are beginning to reveal some of the mechanisms that regulate OGT. Mammalian OGT contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeats consisting of 34-residue motifs in an elongated superhelix with a phylogenetically conserved inner surface that is similar in structure to importin-α and the armadillo repeats of β-catenin. This structural similarity and recent data suggest that a wide range of physiological protein-protein interactions with the tetratricopeptide repeats help target OGT to its many substrates in a highly specific manner (14Jinek M.

OGT also has a catalytic domain related to glycogen phosphorylase and is itself modified by O-GlcNAc and tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that the enzyme is regulated by signal transduction cascades (4Kreppel L.K.

Acta. 2006; 1761: 599-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Recently, OGT was found to play an important role in nematode insulin signaling (21Hanover J.A. Forsythe M.E. Hennessey P.T. Brodigan T.M. Love D.C. Ashwell G. Krause M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11266-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). An OGT-1 deletion allele in nematodes suppresses dauer formation induced by the partial loss of daf-2 (insulin-like receptor) and results in defective macronutrient storage analogous to mammalian insulin resistance (21Hanover J.A. Forsythe M.E. Hennessey P.T. Brodigan T.M. Love D.C. Ashwell G. Krause M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11266-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Deletion of OGT resulted in elevated glycogen storage and decreased fat storage, suggesting that OGT and O-GlcNAc are important for the regulation of the insulin-like pathway in worms. OGT is involved in the liver's insulin signaling pathway and contributes to AKT-mediated signaling at the level of IRS-1 in a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent manner (22Yang X. Ongusaha P.P. Miles P.D. Havstad J.C. Zhang F. So W.V. Kudlow J.E. Michell R.H. Olefsky J.M. Field S.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 2008; 451: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In mammals, deletion of OGT is lethal in embryonic stem cells and in single cells in cell culture (23Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl.

Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1680-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). OGT's regulation by nutrients is largely due to its extraordinary sensitivity to intracellular UDP-GlcNAc concentrations. UDP-GlcNAc is the end product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and is the direct donor sugar nucleotide for OGT (25Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Virtually all nutrients including fatty acids, glucose, and amino acids dramatically affect the levels of UDP-GlcNAc in cells, which in-turn affects dynamic O-GlcNAcylation (26Wells L. Vosseller K.

In this study, we show that insulin signaling stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of OGT, increases its catalytic activity, affects OGT localization, and results in the O-GlcNAc modification of STAT3, a key kinase and transcription factor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (29Cernkovich E.R.

Reagents—Antibodies used in this study are against STAT3 (Cell Signaling), α-tubulin (T5168, Sigma), AL-28 OGT (Hart laboratory (31Iyer S.P. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)), anti-O-GlcNAc CTD 110.6 (Hart laboratory and Covance), and the polyclonal insulin receptor β-chain antibody (M. Daniel Lane laboratory (32Modan-Moses D. Janicot M. McLenithan J.C. Lane M.D. Casella S.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences, and anti-IgM was from Sigma. Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 647 and 488 were from Molecular Probes. Blots were developed with ECL reagent and Hyper-film (GE Healthcare). Recombinant human insulin was from Roche Diagnostics. All other reagents used were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown and differentiated into adipocytes, as described with minor modifications (33Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preadipocytes were grown to confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 10% calf serum containing penicillin-streptomycin and biotin. Two days after confluency, preadipocytes were differentiated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum with dexamethasone (390 ng/ml), insulin (1 μg/ml), and methylisobutylxanthine (115 μg/ml) for 48 h and then treated with insulin (1 μg/ml) for an additional 48 h. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used for experiments 8–11 days after differentiation commenced. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Whole cell lysates were harvested by washing 3T3-L1 three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraping into Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture 1, 40 mm GlcNAc (GlcNAc prevents O-GlcNAcase from removing O-GlcNAc from proteins during cell lysis), and 1 mm NaVO4). For Western blot analysis, the cell lysate was sonicated 2 × 10 s with a 30-s pause between on ice. An equal volume (1:1) of ice-cold Freon (1,1,2-trichloro-trifluoroethane) was added and mixed to remove the lipids and centrifuged at 15, 000 × g, and the protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein reagent. For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were rocked at 4 °C for 2 h to gently lyse cells and solubilize proteins in cell membranes before treating samples in a manner similar to Western blot samples, as stated above. Immunoprecipitations where then performed with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C, captured with protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline. In some cases stated in the text, shorter incubations of 4 h were necessary when trying to preserve post-translational modifications of proteins. Proteins were eluted by boiling Sepharose beads in modified Laemmli buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed with precast Criterion gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v, Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline 0.1% Tween 20, and probed with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were incubated with the blots, and ECL detection was used. When necessary, blots were stripped with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8, for 30 min at room temperature and reprobed with antibodies. Confocal Microscope—Essentially, all microscopy was conducted as described by Slawson et al. (20Slawson C. Zachara N.E. Vosseller K. Cheung W.D. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32944-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were plated onto Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma). Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, immunohistochemistry was performed with the indicated antibodies overnight, and cells were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h in the dark and treated with propidium iodide for nuclear staining, and slides were mounted before fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeis Ultra view 2 confocal microscope at The Johns Hopkins University Microscope Core Facility. Overexpression of OGT in Insect Cells—Essentially overexpression of OGT in insect cells was conducted as indicated in Kreppel and Hart (15Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. High Five (Invitrogen) insect cells were grown in Graces's insect medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum to 70–80% confluency (15-cm dishes) and infected for 40–48 h before harvesting. Cell pellets were frozen at -20 °C. Infected cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl) and lysed by sonication (two pulses each lasting 10 s, power 3.5). Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and loaded on a fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (onto a 5-ml chelating column precharged with NiSO4 and pre-equilibrated with buffer A). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A followed by a 10-ml wash at 5% buffer B and then eluted with a 25-min linear gradient of 5–100% Buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 100 mm imidazole) at 1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected throughout the separation and subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed for purity by Coomassie G250 staining and Western blot analysis. Fractions containing OGT were pooled and concentrated using a Vivaspin6 concentrator (MW 10, 000 cutoff) as per the manufacturer's directions (Vivascience) and buffer-exchanged into 12 ml of Buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and concentrated. The pooled concentrate was brought to 40% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol and stored at -20 °C. OGT Activity Assay—Samples treated as indicated were immunoprecipitated with covalently attached AL-28 to Sepharose A beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and one time with OGT assay buffer (10×: 0.5 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.35 m NaF), divided in half for treatment with or without the acceptor substrate CK2 peptide (PGGSTPVS-SANMM) in UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (0.5 μCi/μl), 25 mm AMP, 0.5 μl, 10× buffer, 5 μl, alkaline phosphatase, 0.25 μl, 10 mm CK2 peptide, 5 μl, and H2O, 10 μl on ice. Samples were incubated at 24 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped with 450 μl of 50 mm formate, 0.5 m NaCl. CK-2 peptides were cleaned up with C18 columns and eluted with methanol, and radioactive incorporation was measured by a scintillation counter. Kinase Assay—Insulin receptor kinase assays were performed essentially as outlined in Kohanski et al. (34Kohanski R.A. Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12272-12281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin receptor was immunoprecipitated from ±100 nm insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and restimulated with 1 μm insulin in vitro for 10 min in kinase buffer (20 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm Mn(CH3CO2)2, 50 mm HEPES, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 6.9) before purified OGT substrate was added. Five μg of OGT was added to each reaction and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. Where indicated commercially produced insulin receptor (IR) (Sigma) was incubated in 1 μm insulin for 10 min before 5 μg of OGT or RCAM-lysozyme was added to the reaction for 15 min at 30 °C. Sigma protocol was followed (product I 9266). β-1,4-Galactosyltransferase Labeling—Immunoprecipitated proteins were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then twice with 1× galactostransferase (GalT) labeling buffer (10×: 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm Gal, 50 mm MnCl2) and then incubated in GalT buffer with 1 μCi/reaction of UDP-[3H]Gal, 1 unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase at 4 °C overnight (35Whelan S.A. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 113-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped with modified Laemmli buffer. Insulin Increases Tyrosine Phosphorylation of OGT in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—OGT is modified with both O-GlcNAc and tyrosine phosphorylation when overexpressed in insect cells (Fig. 1A) (15Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). We examined whether increased tyrosine phosphorylation of OGT occurs in insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. OGT was immunoprecipitated from insulin-stimulated (10 min ± 100 nm insulin) 3T3-L1 adipocytes and immunoblotted with a phospho-tyrosine antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation of OGT increased significantly after a 10-min insulin treatment (Fig. 1B). Whole cell extract in adjacent lanes was also examined for OGT and tyrosine phosphorylation, as a control. A Portion of OGT Co-immunoprecipitates with the Insulin Receptor—Insulin receptor was immunoprecipitated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes ±100 nm insulin. Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for the presence of OGT (Fig. 2A). Whole cell extract was used as a positive control for the presence of OGT. There was a slight increase in the amount of OGT interacting with the insulin receptor upon insulin treatment. We also confirmed the presence of IR- and insulin-induced phosphorylation of the IR in the immunoprecipitation and IR in whole cell extracts (Fig. 2B). Isolated Insulin-stimulated IR Complex Phosphorylates OGT in Vitro—To test the hypothesis that OGT is a direct substrate of the insulin receptor and/or interacting with the insulin receptor proteins, we immunoprecipitated insulin receptor from ±100 nm insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes at 10 min and then restimulated the isolated IR complex with insulin in vitro for 10 min to maximize IR activity. Insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes increased the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor and concomitantly caused increased phosphorylation of OGT (Fig. 3A). The incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into OGT was measured by scintillation counting of excised Coomassie G250-stained OGT bands from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). Insulin induced a 3-fold increase in OGT phosphorylation and over an 11-fold increase in insulin receptor autophosphorylation. Experiments were performed in triplicate. We then tested whether OGT could compete with a well characterized insulin receptor substrate, carboxyamidomethylated lysozyme (RCAM-lysozyme), in an in vitro IR kinase assay. Purified OGT was incubated with non-stimulated (Fig. 3C, lanes 7–12) and insulin-stimulated insulin receptor (lanes 1–6 and lanes 13–17), with and without RCAM-lysozyme (Fig. 3C). OGT becomes phosphorylated upon incubation with activated insulin receptor, and OGT phosphorylation is competitively inhibited by the addition of RCAM-lysozyme (Fig. 3C, upper panel, lanes 10–17). Conversely, RCAM-lysozyme phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, lower panel, lanes 16 and 17) is inhibited by the presence of OGT, indicating that both substrates are competing in vitro for insulin-stimulated insulin receptor phosphorylation. Data represent triplicate experiments conducted on two separate occasions. We also tested and found that a well known tyrosine kinase, Src, could phosphorylate OGT similar to the IR (Fig. 4). Purified OGT was incubated with ±Src in Src kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min. Gel bands of OGT incubated with either +Src or -Src from triplicate experiments were cut out of SDS-PAGE, and [32P]ATP was counted via a scintillation counter. Insulin Stimulates OGT Activity in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes activates an entire cascade of insulin signaling proteins. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, resulting in their activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, represents one of the earliest steps in the insulin signaling cascade. Using 100 nm insulin, the same concentration previously used to maximally stimulate IRS-1 and IRS-2 protein activation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found that insulin stimulation (10 min) of 3T3-L1 adipocytes significantly increased OGT activity when compared with control adipocytes (Fig. 5). To further determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with OGT activity, we treated 3T3-L1 cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate (supplemental Fig. 1). Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with vanadate also resulted in increased OGT activity. When insulin was added to 3T3-L1 cells preincubated with sodium vanadate, there was a further increase in OGT activity versus inhibitor alone. Results shown in Fig. 5 are an average of three experiments, and data represent three independent experiments on separate occasions. OGT Localizes to the Cytoplasm upon 20 Min of Insulin Stimulation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved overnight in serum-free media, stimulated with ±100 nm insulin for 20 min, and fixed, and immunohistochemistry was performed with an OGT polyclonal antibody. The nuclei of the 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stained with propidium iodine to locate and differentiate the nucleus from lipid droplets within the cells. The high concentration of OGT within the nuclei of cells has been established (4Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 36Akimoto Y. Kreppel L.K. Hirano H. Hart G.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2407-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After about 20 min of insulin stimulation, OGT becomes less concentrated within the nucleus, and a portion of the enzyme translocates to the cytoplasm (Fig. 6). We also subfractionated ±100 nm insulin-treated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts that overexpress the insulin receptor and analyzed the insulin-dependent concentration of OGT in cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions via Western blot analysis. In these cells, at 20 min of insulin stimulation, the proportion of OGT within the nucleus decreased, whereas that in the cytoplasm increased (supplemental Fig. 2 and cell fractionation protocol). Insulin Stimulates O-GlcNAc Modification on STAT3 and OGT in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Since insulin stimulates OGT activity, we analyzed whether OGT's increased activity resulted in it modifying other O-GlcNAcylated proteins present. Insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in O-GlcNAc modification of STAT3 within 10 min (Fig. 7A). When OGT was incubated in the presence of insulin-activated IR and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, Western blot analysis showed an increase in O-GlcNAc modification of OGT (Fig. 7B). These data support the hypothesis that OGT is activated by insulin signaling through the IR and that insulin stimulates specific O-GlcNAc modification substrates in a dynamic and transient fashion similar to phosphorylation. The role of O-GlcNAc cycling in cell signaling, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, cellular stress, and protein degradation, as well as many other cellular processes, is just beginning to be revealed (1Whelan S.A.

Hart G.W. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 97: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Increased O-GlcNAc has been shown to directly inhibit insulin signaling in several cell lines (42Patti M.E.

Circulation. 2002; 106: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). OGT itself is known to be modified by both O-GlcNAc and tyrosine phosphorylation (15Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The complexity of OGT's regulation, the stimuli that regulate OGT's activity, and specificity, which in turn control the enzyme's actions on its myriad substrates, may be the combinatorial result of: 1) intricate protein-protein interactions at OGT's tetratricopeptide repeats that allow it to interact with potentially thousands of proteins; 2) a number of post-translational modifications of OGT, such as O-GlcNAc, tyrosine, serine, and threonine phosphorylation; 3) OGT's quaternary structure, and; 4) OGT's response to nutrient sensing through different levels of UDP-GlcNAc. OGT has a number of potential tyrosine, serine, and threonine phosphorylation motif sites that may play a role in the regulation of OGT activity. 4Akilesh Pandey, personal communication. Here, we show that OGT is actively involved in the insulin signaling pathway. Insulin stimulation increases OGT tyrosine phosphorylation. The insulin receptor phosphorylates OGT directly, and other down-stream tyrosine kinases may also be involved, such as Src, a known tyrosine kinase. Interestingly, there are potentially 15 Src tyrosine phosphorylation motifs on OGT. 4Akilesh Pandey, personal communication. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with increased OGT activity. Inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases by vanadate also increases OGT activity. Upon insulin stimulation, a portion of the OGT translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Finally, insulin stimulation results in increased O-GlcNAcylation of several endogenous proteins. Since insulin is capable of stimulating OGT activity and increases O-GlcNAc modification, it is plausible that hyperinsulinemia, in conjunction with hyperglycemia, which increases UDP-GlcNAc pools, may be synergistically activating OGT, leading to abnormally increased O-GlcNAc levels in cells and contributing to insulin resistance. In addition, insulin-stimulated self-GlcNAcylation by OGT may also contribute to the activity of OGT. Post-translational Modification of OGT Regulates Its Activity—Western blot analyses of overexpressed OGT in insect cells initially revealed the presence of O-GlcNAc and tyrosine phosphorylation on OGT. Elevations in O-GlcNAc caused by high glucose, glucosamine, insulin, and the inhibition of O-GlcNAcase inhibit the insulin responsiveness of adipocytes, muscle, and endothelial cells (42Patti M.E. Virkamaki A. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. Yki-Jarvinen H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 43Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Circulation. 2002; 106: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Treating 3T3-L1 cells with 100 nm insulin resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of OGT. OGT has a number of predicted Grb2 SH2 binding motifs that may play a role in OGT's interactions with the insulin receptor. We found that OGT co-immunoprecipitates with the insulin receptor in ±insulin-treated cells, with slightly more OGT bound in the insulin-stimulated samples. We found that insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of OGT increased 3-fold after 15 min of incubation. Analyses of substrate competition between OGT and RCAM-lysozyme phosphorylation, a well studied IR substrate, are competitive substrates for the IR. Insulin Stimulation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Also Increased OGT Activity—Insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes not only increased tyrosine phosphorylation but also increased OGT activity as well. Consistent with the increased OGT activity, OGT O-GlcNAc modification increased upon incubation with insulin-induced activated IR. Inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases also increased OGT activity. The finding that Src tyrosine kinase is also capable of phosphorylating OGT implies that there may be many kinases in different signaling pathways that are capable of phosphorylating and regulating OGT function. OGT may also be regulated, or in turn, regulating insulin signaling at a number of check points in the insulin signaling pathway. It remains to be seen whether insulin also stimulates the interaction of OGT with other insulin signaling proteins, but OGT has 17 potential GSK3β serine kinase motifs and two potential phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 tyrosine binding motifs.4 Insulin Affects the Localization of OGT—In most cells, OGT is mostly localized to the nucleus, with smaller amounts within the cytoplasm (36Akimoto Y. Kreppel L.K. Hirano H. Hart G.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2407-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This localization may be important in the regulation of gene transcription since nearly every transcription factor analyzed to date is modified by O-GlcNAc. Significant amounts of OGT translocated from the nucleus at around 20 min after insulin stimulation and relocalized back to the nucleus after about 40 min. Although OGT translocation correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation, we do not claim this is the cause and effect of tyrosine phosphorylation but rather a result of insulin signaling possibly affecting a multitude of mechanisms downstream including kinases, scaffolding proteins, and/or nuclear pore proteins, resulting in a number of possible post-translation modifications on OGT and protein-protein interactions. Insulin Stimulates the O-GlcNAc Modification of Known O-GlcNAc Protein STAT3—Insulin stimulation of adipocytes resulted in the increased O-GlcNAc modification of Stat3. Stat3 is important in adipogenesis (30Deng J. Hua K. Lesser S.S. Harp J.B. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and leptin response in the hypothalamus, regulating food intake and energy expenditure (45Buettner C. Pocai A. Muse E.D.

Prolactin-induced O-GlcNAcylation of Stat5 was found to be an important post-translational modification for Stat5 binding to the coactivator of transcription cAMP-response element-binding protein binding protein (49Gewinner C.

Since this is an essential interaction for Stat5-mediated gene transcription, the insulin-induced OGT O-GlcNAcylation of Stat3 may also have a crucial role in its function in insulin signaling. Further studies would be interesting to see whether O-GlcNAc modification has any effect on SOCS3 and IRS-1 ubiquitination.

We have demonstrated that a major and a well characterized signaling pathway affects the activity of OGT in the insulin-responsive 3T3-L1 cell line. A growing number of groups are only beginning to elucidate the role that OGT and O-GlcNAc plays in a multitude of cellular functions. This study documents that insulin signaling affects OGT activity, tyrosine phosphorylation, localization, and downstream Stat3 O-GlcNAc modification, which may have a role in the etiology of diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W1967569975,"p53 Is an important regulator of normal cell response to stress and frequently mutated in human tumours. Here, we studied the effects of activation of p53 and its target gene p21 in human embryonic stem cells. We show that activation of p53 with small-molecule activator nutlin leads to rapid differentiation of stem cells evidenced by changes in cell morphology and adhesion, expression of cell-specific markers for primitive endoderm and trophectoderm lineages and loss of pluripotency markers. p21 is quickly and dose-dependently activated by nutlin. It can also be activated independently from p53 by sodium butyrate, which leads to the differentiation events very similar to the ones induced by p53. During differentiation, the activating phosphorylation site of CDK2 Thr-160 becomes dephosphorylated and cyclins A and E become degraded. The target for CDK2 kinase in p53 molecule, Ser-315, also becomes dephosphorylated. We conclude that the main mechanism responsible for differentiation of human stem cells by p53 is abolition of S-phase entry and subsequent stop of cell cycle in G0/G1 phase accompanied by p21 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2024984804,"ALS8 is caused by a dominant mutation in an evolutionarily conserved protein, VAPB (vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated membrane protein B)/ALS8). We have established a fly model of ALS8 using the corresponding mutation in Drosophila VAPB (dVAP33A) and examined the effects of this mutation on VAP function using genetic and morphological analyses. By simultaneously assessing the effects of VAP(wt) and VAP(P58S) on synaptic morphology and structure, we demonstrate that the phenotypes produced by neuronal expression of VAP(P58S) resemble VAP loss of function mutants and are opposite those of VAP overexpression, suggesting that VAP(P58S) may function as a dominant negative. This is brought about by aggregation of VAP(P58S) and recruitment of wild type VAP into these aggregates. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the ALS8 mutation in dVAP33A interferes with BMP signaling pathways at the neuromuscular junction, identifying a new mechanism underlying pathogenesis of ALS8. Furthermore, we show that mutant dVAP33A can serve as a powerful tool to identify genetic modifiers of VAPB. This new fly model of ALS, with its robust pathological phenotypes, should for the first time allow the power of unbiased screens in Drosophila to be applied to study of motor neuron diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1997223441,"Limited responsiveness to inflammatory cytokines is a feature of adult hematopoietic stem cells and contributes to the relative quiescence and durability of the stem cell population in vivo. Here we report that the executioner Caspase, Caspase-3, unexpectedly participates in that process. Mice deficient in Caspase-3 had increased numbers of immunophenotypic long-term repopulating stem cells in association with multiple functional changes, most prominently cell cycling. Though these changes were cell autonomous, they reflected altered activation by exogenous signals. Caspase-3(-/-) cells exhibited cell type-specific changes in phosphorylated members of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in response to specific cytokines, while notably, members of other pathways, such as pSTAT3, pSTAT5, pAKT, pp38 MAPK, pSmad2, and pSmad3, were unaffected. Caspase-3 contributes to stem cell quiescence, dampening specific signaling events and thereby cell responsiveness to microenvironmental stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2029270701,"Inflammation generates various changes in body iron homeostasis, including iron sequestration in the reticuloendothelial system with ensuing hypoferremia and anemia of chronic disease. Increased iron accumulation is caused by hepcidin-mediated down-regulation of the iron export protein ferroportin and higher iron uptake. However, enhanced iron acquisition by macrophages cannot be accounted for by the previously reported transferrin receptor (TfR1) down-regulation in macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon gamma (IFNgamma) because it impairs a major iron uptake mechanism. Because TfR1 is up-regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), we investigated the effect of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals on HIF-1-mediated TfR1 gene expression. Exposure of mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7 and J774A.1 cells or peritoneal macrophages) to LPS/IFNgamma up-regulated NF-kappaB, which in turn rapidly and transiently activated HIF-1-dependent TfR1 expression and iron uptake. Activation of an anti-inflammatory pathway by pre-exposure to the adenosine A(2A) receptor agonist CGS21680 prevented the inducing effect of LPS/IFNgamma on HIF-1 and TfR1 expression by inhibiting NF-kappaB activity, whereas treatment with CGS21680 alone increased HIF-1-mediated TfR1 expression by means of an NF-kappaB-independent signaling pathway. In conclusion, an interplay of the HIF-1 and NF-kappaB pathways controls TfR1 transcription in inflammation. The consequent changes in TfR1 expression may be involved in modulating iron retention in inflammatory macrophages, thus possibly contributing to the development of hypoferremia in the early phases preceding the down-regulation of macrophage ferroportin by hepcidin."
https://openalex.org/W1993695454,"In some mammalian systems small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting homologous sequences in promoter regions of genes induce transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). We have previously reported the induction of TGS by an siRNA (prom-A siRNA) targeting the tandem NF-κB-binding motifs within the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), promoter region. Here we report that induction of TGS by prom-A siRNA is accompanied by immediate and sustained local recruitment of Argonaute-1 (Ago1), histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), and induction of dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2), processes known to be associated with transcriptional silencing. Elevated levels of H3K9me2 and HDAC1 spread upstream of the target sequence, and elevated H3K9me2 levels also spread downstream into the coding region. Moreover, this siRNA induces an immediate change in DNA accessibility to restriction enzyme digestion in the region of the transcription initiation site of the HIV-1. This change in accessibility is because of the relocation of a nucleosome known to be associated with this region of the integrated pro-virus. Although there is a theoretical possibility that the observed viral suppression could be mediated by the PTGS mechanism with this siRNA acting at the 3 ®-long term repeat of the virus, we demonstrate that this siRNA, and three other U3 targeted siRNAs, are inefficient inducers of PTGS. These data strongly suggest that siRNA targeting the promoter region acts predominantly at a site within the 5 ®-long term repeat of HIV to induce transcriptional silencing and alterations to chromatin structure of the HIV promoter region that extend well beyond the immediate siRNA target site.

It is accepted that PTGS can be induced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in a wide range of genes in numerous cell types. It has been also demonstrated that TGS can be induced by RNA duplexes homologous to certain sequences within the promoter regions of genes in human cells, in a similar manner to that previously reported in plants, yeasts, and Drosophila (4Mette M.F.

However, the ability of siRNAs targeting promoter regions to induce TGS in mammalian cells has been controversial, and the mechanisms underlying this process are still being defined. Recently it has been demonstrated that this process is associated with the recruitment of at least one of the argonaute proteins (Ago1 and/or Ago2), which appear to be central components of the RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing (RITS) complex in mammalian cells (18Janowski B.A. Huffman K.E.

Furthermore, the process involves changes to the histone code, involving alteration in methylation status of histone tails (e.g. dimethylation of lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9me2) and trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3), and the recruitment of both histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3) and the polycomb group protein, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (10Buhler M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These changes are consistent with the formation of repressive chromatin structure (17Weinberg M.S. Villeneuve L.M.

Recent reports have shown that the antisense strand of siRNA duplexes, acting alone, interacting with an RNA polymerase II-transcribed promoter-associated RNA species, can direct sequence-specific transcriptional gene silencing (17Weinberg M.S. Villeneuve L.M. Ehsani A. Amarzguioui M. Aagaard L. Chen Z.X. Riggs A.D. Rossi J.J. Morris K.V. RNA (N. Y.). 2006; 12: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 22Weinberg M.S.

Peptide nucleic acids can also induce TGS and chromatin changes. These directly target the transcription start site and induce repressive changes in chromatin architecture of the promoter region, which extend through this site (13Janowski B.A. Kaihatsu K. Huffman K.E. Schwartz J.C. Ram R. Hardy D. Mendelson C.R. Corey D.R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is also becoming clear that miRNAs can also induce both changes in the histone code and chromatin remodeling resulting in repressive chromatin structures. This process is initiated by the ability of miRNA to suppress specific genes at the translational level (30Bennasser Y. Le S.Y. Yeung M.L. Jeang K.T. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 31Li L.C. Okino S.T. Zhao H. Pookot D. Place R.F. Urakami S. Enokida H. Dahiya R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

BMC Mol. Biol. 2007; 8: 63Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). There are therefore several mechanisms by which small RNA species, including siRNA and miRNA, induce transcriptional gene silencing. In each case this silencing is associated with biochemical changes in chromatin consistent with heterochromatin formation. In addition, it has also recently been reported that peptides containing a zinc finger motif, fused with DNA methyltransferase can induce DNA cytosine methylation of certain promoter regions in vitro (34Smith A.E. Hurd P.J. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Ford K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9878-9885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore the mechanisms underlying heterochromatin formation are multiple and complex and can result from the actions of a number of different regulatory molecules. We have previously demonstrated that certain siRNAs with sequences homologous to sequences within the U3 region of the 5′-LTR of either the HIV-1 or simian immunodeficiency virus can induce suppression of viral replication by TGS (12Suzuki K. Shijuuku T. Fukamachi T. Zaunders J. Guillemin G. Cooper D. Kelleher A. J. RNAi Gene Silencing. 2005; 1: 66-78PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lim H.G. Suzuki K. Cooper D.A. Kelleher A.D. Mol. Ther. 2008; 16: 565-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In HIV-1, the effectiveness of this silencing correlates with the degree and density of CpG methylation (12Suzuki K. Shijuuku T. Fukamachi T. Zaunders J. Guillemin G. Cooper D. Kelleher A. J. RNAi Gene Silencing. 2005; 1: 66-78PubMed Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that this process involves the recruitment of components of the RITS complex and changes in the histone code. We demonstrate these changes extend beyond the promoter region and result in the rearrangement of the nucleosome structures adjacent to the transcription start site within the integrated HIV-1 genome. Finally, we demonstrate that these U3-targeted siRNAs are poor inducers of the PTGS pathway, adding weight that this process is the result of the siRNA acting at the promoter region of HIV-1 5′-LTR. RNA Duplexes—Double-stranded RNA duplexes were synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sequences of the RNA duplexes used are as follows: prom-A, 5′-GGGACUUUCCGCUGGGGACTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GUCCCCAGCGGAAAGUCCCTT-3′ (antisense); prom-B, 5′-GGCCCGAGAGCUGCAUCCGGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGGAUGCAGCUCUCGGGCCTT-3′ (antisense); prom-C, 5′-GACUGCUGACAUCGAGCUUTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGCTCGATGTCAGCAGTCTT-3′ (antisense); prom-D, 5′-CUGGGGAGUGGCGAGCCCUTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGGCUCGCCACUCCCCAGTT-3′ (antisense); and code-R, 5′-GCCUCAAUAAAGCUUGCCTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCAAGCUUUAUUGAGGCTT-3′ (antisense). HIV Infection, Transfection of siRNA, and Viral Quantification—5 × 106 MAGIC-5 cells (HeLa cells stably transfected with CD4, CCR-5, and CXCR-4) were infected with the HIV-1NL4-3 subtype B strain (infecting dose equivalent to 38 × 106 copies of HIV-1-RNA), and infection was allowed to establish for 2 days. On day 3, cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA and washed three times with PBS. Transfection of cells was performed using an AMAXA device (Cologne, Germany) with 12 μl of 20 μm solution of siRNA according to the kit insert. After electroporation the cells were resuspended in 2.5 ml of culture medium in standard 6-well culture plates and maintained according to standard protocols (36Aldovini A. Walker B.D. Techniques in HIV Research: HIV-Laboratory Manuals. Macmillan Press, Ltd., Hants, UK1990: 51-128Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in culture supernatants was determined as described previously (37Suzuki K. Craddock B.P. Okamoto N. Kano T. Steigbigel R.T. J. Virol. Methods. 1993; 44: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were conducted according to the standard kit procedure (17-295, Upstate). In short, 2-3 million cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and incubated for 5 min with 0.125 m glycine, and after three washes with cold PBS, the pellets were resuspended into 400 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and the lysate was sonicated for 2 min using a 130-watt ultrasonic processor (Cole-Parmer Inc.) to shear DNA. The lysate was then pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was kept for immunoprecipitation. Various immunoprecipitating antibodies were added to aliquots of lysate. Antibody was then recovered with salmon sperm DNA/protein-A-agarose bead slurry. The beads were washed and resuspended into TE buffer. DNA was extracted by the standard phenol/chloroform procedure. Real time PCR analysis was then conducted. Antibodies used for ChIP assay were as follows: HDAC1 (SC-782, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Ago1 (07-599, Upstate), H3K9me2 (07-449, Upstate), histone H3 acetylation (H3Ac, 06-599, Upstate), and RNA polymerase II (pol II, SC-900, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PCR primers used for real time PCR amplification of DNA isolated by the ChIP process were as follows: LTR-forward, 5′-TACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGG-3′, and LTR-reverse, 5′-AGCTTTATTGAGGCTTAAGC-3′ for the Nucleosome-1 (Nuc-1) region of the LTR; LTRup-forward, 5′-CCAAAGAAGACAAGATATCCTTGA-3′, and LTRup-reverse, 5′-TCATCCATTCCATGCAGGC-3′ for Nuc-0 region of the LTR; SK145, 5′-AGTGGGGGGACATCAAGCAGCCATGCAAAT-3′; SKCC1B, 5′-TACTAGTAGTTCCTGCTATGTCACTTCC-3′ for gag region. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 50 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 15 s, and 68 °C for 35 s with AcuuPrime Taq polymerase with 1 mm SYTO-9 (Invitrogen) with Rotor-Gene 4000 (Corbett, Sydney, Australia). HIV copy number was measured with a standard curve generated with serial dilutions of HIV-1 plasmid (pNL4-3) from 10 to 107 copies per reaction. Chromatin Accessibility Real Time PCR (CHART) Assay—CHART assays were conducted as reported previously (38Rao S. Procko E. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4494-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) with some modifications to specifically target the HIV-1 LTR region. MAGIC-5 cells were washed with cold PBS two times followed by treatment with a lysis buffer (3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 5 min. Cells were washed with the lysis buffer once followed by another wash with RE-2 buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.03 mm spermine, 0.1 mm spermidine, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The nuclei were suspended into NE Buffer 2 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and incubated with 10 units of BglII. DNA was extracted by standard phenol/chloroform procedure. LTR-specific PCR primers used for CHART assay were as follows: LTRkBprimerFOR-1, 5′-AGGTTTGACAGCCGCCTAGCA-3′ and HIVTarREV-1, 5′-TCTGAGGGATCTCTAGTTACCAGAGTC-3′. The cycling conditions employed for real time PCR analysis were 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 50 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 45 s with AcuuPrime Taq polymerase with SyBr Green diluted by a factor of 5× 104 (Invitrogen). HIV copy number was determined against serial dilutions of HIV-1 plasmid (pNL4-3). Assessment of Extent of PTGS Induced by U3 Region-targeted siRNAs—The HIV-1 3′-LTR region was amplified by PCR from HIV-1 plasmid (pNL4-3) with primer set of Nef3′-LTR-Fw1, 5′-CGCTCTAGAGTAGTGTGATTGGATGGCCTGCTGT-3′ (XbaI site underlined), and Nef3′-LTR-Rv1, 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTA-3′ (BamHI site underlined). The resulting 3′-LTR amplicon was cloned into an expression vector (pcDNA3.1/Hygro; Invitrogen) using XbaI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites so that its expression was controlled by the CMV immediate early promoter. Resultant purified plasmids were screened by restriction enzyme digest, and correct insertion was confirmed by sequence analysis. HeLa cells were transfected with a clone of the resulting HIV-1 3′-LTR plasmid using Oligofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hygromycin selection (300 μg/ml) was carried out 2 days after transfection. After 10 days, cloning by limiting dilution was performed. After expansion of these cultures for 50 days, expression of the 3′-LTR was screened for by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the primer set of NUAf, 5′-CCAAAGAAGACAAGATATCCTTGA-3′, and Chips2r, 5′-GCAGCTGCTTATATGCAGCATCTG-3′. A stably transfected clone with high levels of 3′-LTR expression, designated CMV-3LTR1-4, was selected for further study. siRNA Targeting HIV-1 Promoter Induces Gene Silencing—Four siRNAs were designed with sequences homologous to target sequences within the U3 promoter region of HIV-1 LTR (Fig. 1A). MAGIC-5 cells were infected with the HIV-1NL4-3 strain. Two days later separate cultures were transfected with each of the four synthetic siRNAs. New virus production was substantially reduced following transfection of prom-A and prom-B siRNAs. Prom-C siRNA had a less marked effect on viral production, whereas prom-D siRNA had a transient effect at day 6 post-transfection that was lost by day 11 (Fig. 1B). We employed two of four siRNAs for further analysis on virus production as follows: prom-A, which induced the most efficient suppression, and prom-D, which induced the least efficient suppression. Furthermore, we confirmed that prom-A siRNA substantially reduced both cell-associated viral RNA levels and syncytia formation compared with mock-transfected cultures, whereas prom-D siRNA had only a marginal effect on either of these read-outs (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1, A and C). Proviral DNA was detected in all cultures (supplemental Fig. 1B), providing evidence that in this system productive viral infection is suppressed at a stage of the viral life cycle after reverse transcription. These data are similar to our previously reported results, where we demonstrated by nuclear run-on assays that inhibition of viral replication by prom-A siRNA was because of silencing of HIV-1 transcription (12Suzuki K. Shijuuku T. Fukamachi T. Zaunders J. Guillemin G. Cooper D. Kelleher A. J. RNAi Gene Silencing. 2005; 1: 66-78PubMed Google Scholar). Ago1, H3K9me2, and HDAC1 Are Recruited to the Promoter Region—Having confirmed our previous observations, we set out to demonstrate that siRNA-induced TGS of HIV-1 was associated with recruitment of important components of RITS and alterations in histone methylation status. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses using antibodies to Ago1, an integral component of the RITS complex (18Janowski B.A. Huffman K.E. Schwartz J.C. Ram R. Nordsell R. Shames D.S. Minna J.D. Corey D.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 19Kim D.H. Villeneuve L.M. Morris K.V. Rossi J.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and to dimethylated histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2), a marker of heterochromatin formation (39Nakayama J. Rice J.C. Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 292: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 40Peters A.H. Mermoud J.E. O'Carroll D. Pagani M. Schweizer D. Brockdorff N. Jenuwein T. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Transfection of prom-A siRNA into productively infected cultures was associated with recruitment of Ago1 (Fig. 2A) and induction of H3K9me2 (Fig. 2B) in the U3 region of the viral LTR by day 1 post-transfection. These changes were maintained until at least day 11 post-transfection. Transfection of prom-D siRNA was not associated with recruitment of Ago1 and induced less marked enrichment of H3K9me2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, we used ChIP to investigate the recruitment of histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1) to this region. Treatment with prom-A siRNA was followed by an enrichment of HDAC1 bound to HIV-1 LTR (Fig. 2C). This change occurred within 24 h and was sustained for 11 days. This is particularly significant because previous studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of HDAC1 are associated with the 5′-LTR of latent forms of HIV-1 and repressive changes in chromatin structure of the HIV-1 promoter region (41Verdin E.

In contrast, prom-D induced a less marked recruitment of HDAC1 at day 1. However, consistent with the viral production profile in this culture, this recruitment was not sustained, and by day 11 there appeared to be less HDAC1 associated with HIV-1 LTR in the prom D-treated cultures than the mock-transfected cultures. In addition we assessed H3 acetylation status and recruitment of pol II at the Nuc-1 region at day 5 (supplemental Fig. 2). The data showed a failure of enrichment of H3Ac and an inhibition of recruitment of pol II in prom-A siRNA-treated cultures compared with mock-treated cultures. In contrast, there was substantial maintenance of levels of H3Ac, but only partial recruitment of pol II, to this region in prom-D siRNA-treated cultures. These data suggest the induction of stable heterochromatin in prom-A siRNA-treated cultures, whereas in the prom-D siRNA-treated cultures there are partial changes in this region of chromatin, resulting in partial and transient inhibition of transcription. siRNA Induces Recruitment of a Nucleosome at the Transcription Initiation Site—The above data suggested that prom-A siRNA treatment may have induced sustained alterations in the structure of the chromatin associated with the LTR of HIV-1, although prom-D did not. The architecture of the nucleosomes associated with HIV-1 5′-LTR after integration has been well described (41Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C.

https://openalex.org/W1973288117,"Nutlin-3 is a selective inhibitor of the p53-Mdm2 interaction, and inhibits growth in most tumor cells with wild-type p53. However, it only induces apoptosis in subsets of tumor cells. We report that the apoptotic response induced by Nutlin-3 correlates with its antitumor effects in xenograft models in athymic mice. We have investigated signals that sensitize cells to undergo apoptosis induced by Nutlin-3. We demonstrate that adenovirus E1A increases Nutlin-3-induced apoptosis through pRb inhibition in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells in a p53-dependent manner. Consistent with this, pRb depletion by siRNA transfection with Nutlin-3 synergistically increases apoptosis in HCT116 human colon cancer cells, which are insensitive to induction of apoptosis by Nutlin-3 alone. As pRb is a key negative regulator of E2F, we asked whether E2F transcriptional activity determines the apoptotic response of cancer cells to Nutlin-3. We demonstrate that transcriptional activity of E2F correlates with the apoptotic response to Nutlin-3 in various tumor cells and depletion of E2F-1 suppresses Nutlin-3-induced apoptosis in cells possessing high transcriptional activity of E2F, including retinoblastoma cells harboring mutated Rb with wild-type p53. Furthermore, we report that expression of the p53 homologue p73, a target of E2F-1, is markedly increased by Nutlin-3 in Rb-mutated tumor cells harboring wild-type p53. Depletion of p73 by siRNA transfection suppresses Nutlin-3-induced apoptosis in these cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that E2F-1 transcriptional activity is a critical determinant of Mdm2 antagonist-induced apoptosis and p73 is important for E2F-1-mediated apoptosis induced by Nutlin-3, especially in tumor cells with mutated Rb. Furthermore, our results suggest that tumor cells, including Rb mutated cells, which harbor wild-type p53 and high E2F transcriptional activity, could be a good target for Mdm2 antagonist therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2138554472,"The crystal structure of a 1:1 complex between the German cockroach allergen Bla g 2 and the Fab′ fragment of a monoclonal antibody 7C11 was solved at 2.8-Å resolution. Bla g 2 binds to the antibody through four loops that include residues 60-70, 83-86, 98-100, and 129-132. Cation-π interactions exist between Lys-65, Arg-83, and Lys-132 in Bla g 2 and several tyrosines in 7C11. In the complex with Fab′, Bla g 2 forms a dimer, which is stabilized by a quasi-four-helix bundle comprised of an α-helix and a helical turn from each allergen monomer, exhibiting a novel dimerization mode for an aspartic protease. A disulfide bridge between C51a and C113, unique to the aspartic protease family, connects the two helical elements within each Bla g 2 monomer, thus facilitating formation of the bundle. Mutation of these cysteines, as well as the residues Asn-52, Gln-110, and Ile-114, involved in hydrophobic interactions within the bundle, resulted in a protein that did not dimerize. The mutant proteins induced less β-hexosaminidase release from mast cells than the wild-type Bla g 2, suggesting a functional role of dimerization in allergenicity. Because 7C11 shares a binding epitope with IgE, the information gained by analysis of the crystal structure of its complex provided guidance for site-directed mutagenesis of the allergen epitope. We have now identified key residues involved in IgE antibody binding; this information will be useful for the design of vaccines for immunotherapy.

Cockroach allergy is associated with the development of asthma and is a risk factor for emergency room admission of asthmatic patients, especially among inner city children living in low-income houses infested with cockroaches (1Arruda L.K.

Cockroaches release allergens to the environment, which are carried by particles (5-40 μm of diameter) that reach the lung by inhalation. Bla g 2 is one of the most important cockroach allergens, eliciting production of specific IgE in ∼70% of cockroach-allergic patients at exposure levels that are 10-100-fold lower than those from other common indoor allergens from dust mite and cat (3Arruda L.K.

Exposure to Bla g 2 results in cross-linking of IgE bound to the surface of mast cells or basophils from sensitized patients (i.e. in immunological terms, cross-linking refers to the non-covalent linkages between the allergen and two IgE molecules at the surface of mast cells or basophils), and induces release of potent mediators (histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, etc.) of allergic reactions. We recently solved the crystal structure of Bla g 2, confirming that the overall fold of this allergen corresponds to that of pepsin-like aspartic proteases, and revealing structural elements that explain why it is enzymatically inactive (6Gustchina A. Li M. Wunschmann S. Chapman M.D. Pomés A. Wlodawer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Wünschmann S. Gustchina A. Chapman M.D. Pomés A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2005; 116: 140-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Bla g 2 contains important amino acid substitutions in the area corresponding to the catalytic site. These modifications impair enzymatic function, and the allergen did not show proteolytic activity in standard in vitro assays using casein and hemoglobin as substrates (7Wünschmann S. Gustchina A. Chapman M.D. Pomés A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2005; 116: 140-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Bla g 2 belongs to a group of inactive aspartic proteases that also includes the family of pregnancy-associated glycoproteins. The latter proteins have similar active site substitutions to Bla g 2 and are produced in the chorion of pregnant females from ungulate species such as pig, sheep, cow, and horse (8Guruprasad K.

Unlike other members of the pepsin family, Bla g 2 is a zinc-binding protein and has five instead of the usual two or three disulfide bonds that are present in typical aspartic proteases. These two features provide stability to the protein, thus increasing the persistence of this allergen in the environment (6Gustchina A. Li M. Wunschmann S. Chapman M.D. Pomés A. Wlodawer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of eight indoor allergens have been solved to date, but there are few studies of epitopes or allergen-antibody interactions. Only three allergen-antibody complex structures have been resolved to date: birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1 (9Spangfort M.D. Mirza O. Ipsen H. Van Neerven R.J. Gajhede M. Larsen J.N. J.

A majority of reports describing epitope mapping have not been based on the tertiary structure, but rather have used different approaches, such as libraries of overlapping synthetic peptides, e.g. for food allergens (12Burks A.W. Shin D. Cockrell G. Stanley J.S. Helm R.M. Bannon G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the expression of allergen peptides as recombinant proteins, and the creation of epitope expression cDNA libraries (13Ball T.

For inhaled allergens, such as Bla g 2, that are globular and stable, approaches to map antigenic determinants involving the tertiary structure of the protein are essential. Determination of the structure of allergen-antibody complexes facilitates epitope mapping and reveals the precise architecture of a conformational epitope. The mapping strategy utilized in this study involved co-crystallization of the allergen with Fab′ fragments of a monoclonal antibody that partially overlaps with IgE antibodies. Site-directed mutagenesis of the epitope identified by this procedure will allow rational design of hypoallergens for immunotherapy. Expression and Purification of rBla g 2—A partially deglycosylated recombinant Bla g 2 mutant protein (rBla g 2 N93Q) was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified by affinity chromatography using 7C11 mAb, as previously described (6Gustchina A. Li M. Wunschmann S. Chapman M.D. Pomés A. Wlodawer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA encoding for the mature form of Bla g 2 with a mutation (N93Q) in one of the three N-glycosylation motifs was inserted into the P. pastoris expression vectorpGAPZαC(Invitrogen) for constitutive expression of the allergen. Recombinant Bla g 2 was expressed and purified from culture media by affinity chromatography over a 7C11 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3The abbreviations used are:mAbmonoclonal antibodyr.m.s.root mean-squaredPEGpolyethylene glycolELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayCDRcomplementarity determining regions. column as described (15Pomés A.

Production of Fab′ from the 7C11 Monoclonal Antibody and Formation of the rBla g 2-Fab′ Complex—Monoclonal anti-Bla g 2 antibody 7C11 (clone 7C11 C2 A6) was purified from ammonium sulfate-precipitated ascites by affinity chromatography through a protein G column. Purified antibody was fragmented using pepsin and F(ab′)2 fragments were purified by protein A chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. In brief, F(ab′)2 fragments were applied to a HiTrap 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.2. Eluted fractions containing F(ab′)2 were further purified by protein A chromatography (Protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow, GE Healthcare). Purity of the (Fab′)2 was analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. F(ab′)2 were reduced with 3 mm dithiothreitol in 20 mm phosphate buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl at pH 7.2 for 30 min at 4 °C. The free disulfide bonds were blocked by adding 300 mm iodoacetamide for 3 h at 4 °C. The solution was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, 0.2 m NaCl at pH 7.2 overnight, concentrated to 15 mg/ml, and loaded onto a Superdex 75 (10/30) gel filtration column. The peak containing Fab′ was collected, concentrated, and mixed with Bla g 2 at a 1:1 molar ratio. The mixture was further purified over a Superdex 200, HPLC column and concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml for crystallization. Sequencing of the Monoclonal Antibody 7C11—The cell line producing the anti-Bla g 2 mAb 7C11 C2 A6 was grown at the Lymphocyte Culture Center (University of Virginia). Total RNA (44 μg/3 × 106 cells) was isolated from the 7C11 mAb cell line using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNAs encoding for the light and heavy chains of the mAb were obtained by reverse transcription from RNA (SuperScript™ III, Invitrogen), and the DNA was PCR-amplified using specific primers, sequenced, and analyzed. To amplify the light and heavy chains of the antibody, two and four pairs of primers were initially tested, respectively. A degenerate primer for the N terminus (VHa: 5′-gag gtt cag ctg cag cag(ct)c-3′, encoding for EVQLQQ), and the C-terminal primer (CH2: 5′-tt agg agt cag agt aat ggt gag cac atc c-3′, encoding for DVLTITLTP) amplified the heavy chain. Forward (5′-c aac aca gcc tac ctg c-3′, encoding for NTAYL) and reverse (5′-a ggt cac tgt cac tgg ctc agg-3′, encoding for PEPVTVT) middle primers were used to complete heavy chain sequencing. To amplify the light chain, a primer was designed based on the N-terminal sequence of the antibody and the sequence of homologous light chains from a BLAST search (primer L2F, 5′-cac aaa ttc atg tcc aca tca-3′, encoding for HKFMSTS). The mAb was isotyped G1 for the heavy chain and kappa (κ) for the light chain using the IsoStrip (Roche Applied Science). Crystallization of the rBla g 2-Fab′ Complex—Crystals of complex of Bla g 2 with Fab′ were obtained using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. Each drop contained 2 μl of ∼5 mg/ml allergen/antibody complex in 20 mm Tris buffer, 0.2 m NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.2, as well as 2 μl of reservoir solution consisting of 16% PEG 10,000 in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.6. The crystals are shaped as thin plates, with the dimensions of ∼0.15 × 0.2 × 0.01 mm. They belong to the monoclinic space group P21, and each asymmetric unit contains two molecules of Bla g 2, as well as two molecules of Fab′. Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Diffraction data extending to nominal 2.8 Å resolution were collected from one crystal at the SER-CAT beamline 22-ID located at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron (Argonne, IL). Data were measured with a Mar225CCD detector and were integrated and scaled with the HKL2000 package (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Prior to data collection, the crystal was rapidly cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen stream, after being transferred to the cryo-solution containing 16% PEG 10K and 10% glycerol, pH 5.6, in sodium citrate buffer. The highest resolution shell, which is over 75% complete, is 2.93-3.0 Å, thus the actual resolution of the structure might be slightly lower than the nominal one of 2.8 Å (Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsWavelength (Å)1.000Space groupP21Unit cell parameters (Å)a = 77.0, b = 103.2, c = 146.3, β = 94.8°Resolution (Å)50-2.8Number of reflections (unique/total)51,667 (170,997)Completeness % (total/last shell)93.3 (65.2)Rmerge % (total/last shell)9.8 (30.1)No. of molecules in a.u.2No. of protein atoms11600No. of solvent molecules111No. of heteroatoms86Rcryst23.2%Rfree (5%)28.1%R.m.s. deviations from idealityBond lengths0.006 ÅAngle distances1.05°Ramachandran plot (most favored/allowed/generously allowed/disallowed)88.9%/10.0%/0.8%/0.2% Open table in a new tab The structure of Bla g 2/Fab′ complex was solved by molecular replacement using the program PHASER (18Storoni L.C.

A number of different models of Fab were used in the search for this component, with the best result provided by Fab D44.1 (PDB accession code 1MLB). Solution of the molecular replacement was unambiguous, with the final Z-score 49.3 and LLG 4915. The structure was refined using the program REFMAC5 (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J.

The final model contains two Bla g 2 molecules, two Fab′ molecules, and 111 water molecules, and is characterized by Rfree of 28.1% and R of 23.2%. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB with accession code 2NR6. Expression of Bla g 2 Mutant Proteins in P. pastoris—Two mutant proteins of either the two cysteines alone (C51aS and C113A), or both cysteines plus additional residues that may be involved in dimerization (C51aA, N52A, Q110N, C113A, and I114A), were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. The DNA template consisted of Bla g 2 cDNA inserted into the P. pastoris expression vector pGAPZαC that allows constitutive expression of the allergen. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed sequentially with two sets of primers per mutant using QuikChangeTM (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutated DNA was used to transform the XL1-Blue supercompetent cells and bacterial clones were sequenced to confirm the desired amino acid substitutions. DNA was linearized and electroporated into P. pastoris for expression. Recombinant allergens were purified by 7C11 mAb affinity chromatography. The presence of dimers in the expressed allergens was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. Bla g 2 proteins in PBS or protein standards (low molecular weight gel filtration kit, GE Healthcare) were applied to a HiTrap 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) and elution profiles were compared. CD Spectra of Wild Type and Mutant Proteins—Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy experiments were performed using an AVIV model 202 CD spectropolarimeter with a 1-mm cuvette. The scanning was set using 0.5-nm steps, 7.5 s averaging time, from 260 to 194 nm. Bla g 2 proteins, wild type and mutants, were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at 0.34-0.66 mg/ml. Data were analyzed with the program CDNN v2.1 (22Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Bla g 2 analysis required CDNN reference set 33 for complex CD spectra proteins. Effect of Bla g 2 Mutant Proteins on IgE-mediated Degranulation from Sensitized Skin Mast Cells—The β-hexosaminidase assay was used to test the effect of the Bla g 2 mutant proteins on IgE-mediated degranulation from sensitized skin mast cells (23Kepley C.L. Taghavi S. Mackay G. Zhu D. Morel P.A. Zhang K. Ryan J.J. Satin L.S. Zhang M. Pandolfi P.P. Saxon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35139-35149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the measurement of β-hexosaminidase released from mast cells from three non-allergic donors, which were sensitized with sera from a cockroach allergic patient (64 ng/ml of anti-cockroach IgE; CAP class 5). Skin mast cells were sensitized overnight with a 1:25 dilution of serum from a cockroach-sensitive patient. The next day, cells were washed and challenged without the allergen (testing for spontaneous release) or with different concentrations of allergen (0.01-10 μg/ml). β-Hexosaminidase activity was measured as a percent of total within the cell, and statistical differences were assessed by Student’s t test. Skin mast cells were obtained from human surgical specimens. All studies were approved by the Human Studies Committee at Virginia Commonwealth University Health Systems. Description of the Complex and Dimerization Mode—The crystal structure of the complex formed between Bla g 2 and the Fab′ fragment of monoclonal antibody 7C11 was solved at 2.8-Å resolution. In the crystals, a dimer of Bla g 2 interacts with two Fab′ molecules, forming two 1:1 complexes, related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry operation (Fig. 1A). Each antibody only interacts with one out of two monomers. Superposition of the two crystallographically independent complexes yielded an r.m.s. deviation of 0.42 Å for 739 Cα atoms, with even lower deviations for the individual components (0.16 Å for 317 Cα atoms of Bla g 2, 0.26 Å for 206 atoms in the antibody light chain, and 0.33 Å for the 206 atoms in antibody heavy chain). The differences in the r.m.s. values for the individual molecules are most likely related to their involvement in the crystal contacts. The Bla g 2 dimer observed in the structure of the allergen-antibody complex is stabilized by the formation of a quasi-four-helical bundle comprised of one short α-helix and one helical turn from each monomer. The α-helix includes residues 48-51, and the helical turn contains residues 110-114, with these elements related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis in a dimer (Fig. 1, A and B). These two fragments are present as two short helices in almost all other pepsin-like aspartic proteases (24Sielecki A.R. Fedorov A.A. Boodhoo A. Andreeva N.S. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The insertion of two residues (Cys51a and Pro51b; see Fig. 4 in Ref. 6Gustchina A. Li M. Wunschmann S. Chapman M.D. Pomés A. Wlodawer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) within the first fragment distorts its conformation, transforming a helix into a helical turn. The interactions within the bundle include hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, and are formed between the residues from both monomers (Fig. 1B). A unique disulfide bridge (Cys51a-Cys113) connects the helix and the helical turn within each Bla g 2 monomer. The overall area of the dimer interface calculated with CNS was 1139 Å2 per molecule (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). A comparison between free and bound state of the allergen did not reveal any major conformational changes (Fig. 2A). The overall r.m.s. deviations between free Bla g 2 and the two allergen molecules in the dimer within the complex were 0.28 Å and 0.30 Å for 309 and 307 Cα atoms, respectively. The largest conformational changes occured in the area interacting with the antibody in the vicinity of Asp68a (2.8 Å) (Fig. 2B). Other differences (r.m.s. deviations 0.8-1.6 Å) include three surface loops, composed of the residues 158-160, 200-202, and 239-245 (Fig. 2A). The latter loop also contributed to the interactions between the monomers in the dimer. The Allergen/Antibody Interface: Continuous versus Discontinous Epitope—Monoclonal antibody 7C11 recognizes a large epitope on the surface of the N-terminal domain of a Bla g 2 monomer, which includes four loops (loop 1, residues 60-70; loop 2, residues 83-86; loop 3, residues 98-100; and loop 4, residues 129-132), interacting with all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the Fab′ and forming tight 1:1 complex (Fig. 3, A and B). In the crystals, two Fab′ molecules (chains C, E and D, F for the light and heavy chains, respectively, in the PDB coordinate file) interact with a dimer of Bla g 2 (chains A and B in the PDB file) in a symmetrical manner, forming two 1:1 complexes (ACD and BEF). The contact areas between the allergen monomer and the Fab′ are calculated to be 862 Å2 for the former and 877 Å2 for the latter (program CNS, Ref. 25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The light chain of the antibody recognizes predominantly one continuous epitope on the surface of Bla g 2 molecule, which consists of nine consecutive residues Lys-60-Asn-70 from loop 1 plus the side chain of Arg-83 of loop 2, protruding through loop 1 in the direction of L3 of the light chain (Fig. 4A). All three CDRs of the light chain (L1, L2, and L3) are involved in the extensive and complex network of the interactions with the residues 60-70 and Arg-83 of Bla g 2. Although the exact nature of the interactions is not always accurately defined at the moderate resolution of 2.8 Å, the identity and orientation of the potentially interacting residues should suffice to postulate the type of contacts. These interactions are predominantly polar, involving a number of potential hydrogen bonds and ion pairs between the antibody and both the main chain and the side chains of the allergen, thus defining this continuous, almost linear epitope (Fig. 4A). Two pairs of residues, Lys-65 (Bla g 2) and Tyr-53 from L2 on one end, and Arg-83 (Bla g 2) and Tyr-92 from L3 on another, are involved in cation-π type interactions (Fig. 4B). The only interactions with the heavy chain within this epitope are found in the vicinity of Asp68A (Fig. 4C). This is a unique residue in the allergen that interacts with both the light and heavy chains of the antibody, involving both carboxyl oxygens of the side chain of Asp68A. One of them forms an ionic pair with His-35 of H1, and the other is hydrogen-bonded to Gln-96 of L3. In addition, several hydrogen bonds are formed between the main chain atoms of residues 67-70 in the allergen with Arg-59 (H2) (Fig. 4A), as well as with Trp-99 (H3) and His-91 (L3) (Fig. 4C). As pointed out before, this is also the area with the largest conformational changes in the allergen bound to the antibody (Fig. 2B). Glu-86 is another residue of loop 2 that interacts with the antibody. This residue, together with Gln-98 and Asp-100 of loop 3, as well as Lys-132 of loop 4, maintain a discontinuous part of the allergen-antibody epitope. All three residues of loops 2 and 3 are involved in charge and polar interactions with Arg-101 of H3 (Fig. 5A). The orientation of the side chain of Arg-101 is stabilized by the hydrophobic contacts with Ile-67 of loop 1. Lys-132 is a major contributor to the interactions between the residues of small loop 4 and two heavy chain CDRs, H1 and H2 (Fig. 5, B and C). It forms an ion pair with Asp-52 (H2) in both monomers. In addition, Lys-132 is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Lys-30 (H1) in one monomer (Fig. 5B), whereas in the other monomer it is involved in cation-π interactions with Tyr-33 (H1) in the heavy chain (Fig. 5C). The orientation of the ring of Tyr-33 (H1) seems to be maintained by the hydrophobic and possible cation-π interactions with Arg-50 (H2) (Fig. 5C). No significant conformational changes were found in the antibody-bound allergen around Lys-132 compared with its unbound state. At the same time, the mobility of the residues in the antibody that interact with Lys-132 is restricted by the intrinsic interactions within H1 and H2 CDRs. The surfaces of both the allergen and the antibody within this epitope appear to possess a high degree of complementarity prior to binding. Therefore, Lys-132 is a good candidate for site-directed mutagenesis aimed at reducing the antibody binding properties of Bla g 2. Relevance of Dimerization to IgE Cross-linking—Mutant proteins that were expected to be unable to dimerize were designed, expressed in P. pastoris, and purified by affinity chromatography. Cysteines 51a and 113 alone (Mut 1), or both cysteines as well as the residues Asn-52, Gln-110, and Ile-114 (Mut 2) were substituted by either alanines or serines by site-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of CD spectra confirmed a similar folding of Bla g 2 wild type and mutants. In agreement with these results, ELISA showed parallel dose-response curves for wild type and mutant proteins (Fig. 6, A and B). No decrease of IgE antibody binding was observed by the mutations (data not shown). Size exclusion chromatography showed that only Mut 2 behaved as a monomer in phosphate buffer, whereas Bla g 2 wild type and Mut 1 behaved as dimers (Fig. 6C). Therefore, the additional disruption of hydrophobic interactions involving residues Asn-52, Gln-110, and Ile-114 was necessary to prevent dimerization. IgE cross-linking by wild type Bla g 2 and the monomeric Mut 2 was assessed by a cell release assay based on the measurement of β-hexosaminidase released from mast cells sensitized with sera from a cockroach allergic patient. The dimeric wild-type Bla g 2 induced significantly more β-hexosaminidase release than the monomeric Mut 2 (Fig. 7). Crystallographic studies of allergen-antibody complexes are the most direct approach to determine the precise molecular structure of a conformational epitope. Given the polyclonal nature and limited amount of IgE antibodies in sera (<1 μg/ml compared with ∼10 mg/ml for IgG) to study the allergen-antibody interaction we selected the Bla g 2-specific monoclonal antibody 7C11, which shows evidence of binding to an overlapping epitope with IgE. The crystal structure of the complex reveals that two antibody mol"

These studies have advanced our understanding of genes associated with neuromuscular transmission and resistance to the antinematodal drug. In lev-8 and lev-1 mutant C. elegans, levamisole resistance is associated with reductions in levamisole-activated whole muscle cell currents. Although lev-8 and lev-1 are known to code for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, an explanation for why these currents get smaller is not available. In wild-type adults, nAChRs aggregate at neuromuscular junctions and are not accessible for single-channel recording. Here we describe a use of LEV-10 knockouts, in which aggregation is lost, to make in situ recordings of nAChR channel currents. Our observations provide an explanation for levamisole resistance produced by LEV-8 and LEV-1 mutants at the single-channel level."

However, the molecular mechanisms of the chemopreventive potential of cocoa and its active ingredient(s) remain unknown. Here we report that cocoa procyanidins inhibit neoplastic cell transformation by suppressing the kinase activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). A cocoa procyanidin fraction (CPF) and procyanidin B2 at 5 mug/ml and 40 mum, respectively, inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ mouse epidermal (JB6 P+) cells by 47 and 93%, respectively. The TPA-induced promoter activity and expression of cyclooxygenase-2, which is involved in tumor promotion and inflammation, were dose-dependently inhibited by CPF or procyanidin B2. The activation of activator protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB induced by TPA was also attenuated by CPF or procyanidin B2. The TPA-induced phosphorylation of MEK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p90 ribosomal s6 kinase was suppressed by CPF or procyanidin B2. In vitro and ex vivo kinase assay data demonstrated that CPF or procyanidin B2 inhibited the kinase activity of MEK1 and directly bound with MEK1. CPF or procyanidin B2 suppressed JB6 P+ cell transformation induced by epidermal growth factor or H-Ras, both of which are known to be involved in MEK/ERK signal activation. In contrast, theobromine (up to 80 mum) had no effect on TPA-induced transformation, cyclooxygenase-2 expression, the transactivation of activator protein-1 or nuclear factor-kappaB, or MEK. Notably, procyanidin B2 exerted stronger inhibitory effects compared with PD098059 (a well known pharmacological inhibitor of MEK) on MEK1 activity and neoplastic cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2047409223,"Oncogenic KIT or PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinase mutations are compelling therapeutic targets in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and the KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitor, imatinib, is standard of care for patients with metastatic GIST. However, most of these patients eventually develop clinical resistance to imatinib and other KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitors and there is an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic strategies. We reported previously that protein kinase C-θ (PKCθ) is activated in GIST, irrespective of KIT or PDGFRA mutational status, and is expressed at levels unprecedented in other mesenchymal tumors, therefore serving as a diagnostic marker of GIST. Herein, we characterize biological functions of PKCθ in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GISTs, showing that lentivirus-mediated PKCθ knockdown is accompanied by inhibition of KIT expression in three KIT+/PKCθ+ GIST cell lines, but not in a comparator KIT+/PKCθ− Ewing's sarcoma cell line. PKCθ knockdown in the KIT+ GISTs was associated with inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway, upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27, antiproliferative effects due to G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis, comparable to the effects seen after direct knockdown of KIT expression by KIT short-hairpin RNA. These novel findings highlight that PKCθ warrants clinical evaluation as a potential therapeutic target in GISTs, including those cases containing mutations that confer resistance to KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitors."

We have developed a series of single (non-consensus) methods (SPARKS, SP(2), SP(3), SP(4)) that are based on weighted matching of two to four sequence and structure-based profiles. There is a robust improvement of the accuracy and sensitivity of fold recognition as the number of matching profiles increases. Here, we introduce a new profile-profile comparison term based on real-value dihedral torsion angles. Together with updated real-value solvent accessibility profile and a new variable gap-penalty model based on fractional power of insertion/deletion profiles, the new method (SP(5)) leads to a robust improvement over previous SP method. There is a 2% absolute increase (5% relative improvement) in alignment accuracy over SP(4) based on two independent benchmarks. Moreover, SP(5) makes 7% absolute increase (22% relative improvement) in success rate of recognizing correct structural folds, and 32% relative improvement in model accuracy of models within the same fold in Lindahl benchmark. In addition, modeling accuracy of top-1 ranked models is improved by 12% over SP(4) for the difficult targets in CASP 7 test set. These results highlight the importance of harnessing predicted structural properties in challenging remote-homolog recognition. The SP(5) server is available at http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu."

Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). From Drosophila to mammals, the TGF-β signaling network centers around the Smad proteins, which are categorized into R-Smads (receptor-activated Smads, i.e. Smads1/2/3/5/8), Co-Smads (i.e. Smad4), and I-Smads (inhibitory Smads, i.e. Smads6/7). The R- and Co-Smads are essential mediators of TGF-β signaling, while the I-Smads served to dampen TGF-β signaling in a feedback manner (2Shi Y. Massagué J.

Such intracellular movement of Smads underlies the inducibility of transcriptional regulation by Smads. In contrast, the I-Smad, Smad7 is largely present in the nucleus at the basal state and reportedly undergoes nucleus-to-cytoplasm translocation in response to TGF-β.

R-Smads and Smad4 can enter the nucleus in both the basal state and upon TGF-β stimulation, regardless of the phosphorylation state at the C termini of R-Smads (7Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massagué J.

Recent RNA interference (RNAi) studies in both Drosophila and human cells provided strong evidence that Msk and its human orthologs Imp7 and Imp8 are indispensable for nuclear accumulation of activated phospho-R-Smads (9Xu L. Yao X. Chen X. Lu P. Zhang B. Ip Y.T. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, Msk and Imp7/8 are not as essential for basal state R-Smad nuclear import, because knockdown of Msk and Imp7/8 did not affect distribution of Mad and Smad2/3 in unstimulated cells (9Xu L. Yao X. Chen X. Lu P. Zhang B. Ip Y.T. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that basal state nuclear import of R-Smads might entail additional pathways, including the importin-independent or the importin-β1-mediated mechanism suggested by previous in vitro studies (10Xu L.

It is not immediately obvious whether Msk/Imp7/8 would be involved in nuclear import of the other Smads including Smad4 and Smad7. Smad7 resides preferentially in the nucleus in unstimulated cells, and Smad4 could become predominantly nuclear when the export factor CRM-1 is blocked by LMB, without TGF-β signaling and completely separate from R-Smads (14Watanabe M.

In this study, we used RNAi to evaluate the roles of Imp7 and Imp8 in the nuclear import of Smad4 and Smad7 either at the basal state or upon TGF-β stimulation. In addition, we overexpressed Imp7 and 8 to comprehensively examine their impact on the distribution of R-Smads, Smad4, and Smad7. These experiments verified the roles of Imp7/8 in nuclear import of Smad4 and ruled out the involvement of either Imp7 or Imp8 in regulating subcellular distribution of Smad7. Interestingly, our data also suggest that despite sequence similarities to other R- and Co-Smads, Smad2 and Medea (Drosophila Smad4) are not bona fide import cargoes of Imp8/Msk. These observations suggested specificity in Smad nuclear import through Imp8. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cytokine Treatment—293T and HeLa cell culture were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s media (DME) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml) (all from Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Mammalian cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Drosophila S2R+ cells were grown at 25 °C in Schneider’s Drosophila Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml, all from Invitrogen). Effectene was used to transfect S2R+ cells using the manufacturer’s recommended procedures (Qiagen). For TGF-β treatment, human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) was used at a final concentration of 100 pm for 1 h. Leptomycin B (LMB, Sigma) was used at 10 ng/ml for 30 min. RNAi in Mammalian and Drosophila Cells—For mammalian cells, synthetic siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon) were transfected at 40 nm using HiperFect following the vendor’s instructions (Qiagen). The sequence for the Imp8 siRNAs was described in our previous publication (9Xu L. Yao X. Chen X. Lu P. Zhang B. Ip Y.T. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).

Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The anti-Imp7/8 antibody was raised against recombinant amino acids 885-1038 of human Imp8. The Smad4 antibody has been described previously (16Jayaraman L. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40710-40717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Other antibodies were purchased from commercial sources (polyclonal and monoclonal anti-Flag: Sigma; anti-HA: Cell Signaling; antilamin A/C: Cell Signaling; Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG: Invitrogen). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were treated with trypsin and harvested into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and supplemented with protease inhibitors. After 5 min, the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was further extracted for 15 min on ice in 20 mm TrisCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was collected as the nuclear fraction. Immunofluorescence Staining and Quantification—The procedures for immunofluorescence staining were described before (9Xu L. Yao X. Chen X. Lu P. Zhang B. Ip Y.T. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fluorescent microscopy was done using a Nikon TE2000-S inverted microscope, and the images were captured by a Spot RT-KE digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). For confocal microscopy, a DMIRE2 Inverted Microscope and a TCS scanning system from Leica were used (Leica). In one method to quantify nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization, cells were categorized based on whether the immunofluorescence signal was predominantly nuclear, even or predominantly cytoplasm. Cells falling into each category were counted in a blind fashion (n > 150). In a second method, fluorescence microscopy images captured under the same exposure conditions were analyzed using Image J to quantify per unit area staining intensity in the cytoplasm and nucleus (∼20 positively stained cells from multiple fields). Protein-Protein Interaction—293T cells with or without prior TGF-β treatment (100 pm, 1 h) were harvested and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 1:2 with 20 mm HEPES and used for immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag-conjugated-agarose beads (Sigma) or anti-Imp7/8 plus protein A beads (Roche Applied Science). After incubation for 6 h, the beads were pelleted and washed 3× in the same buffer used during immunoprecipitation. Impact of Imp7 and 8 Knockdown on Nuclear Translocation of Smad4—In unstimulated HeLa cells, endogenous Smad4 was detected in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by immunoblotting. TGF-β treatment led to a decrease in the cytoplasm/nucleus ratio of Smad4 concentration reflecting signal-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad4 (Fig. 1A). When Imp7 or Imp8 was individually depleted by siRNAs, the cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of Smad4 in response to TGF-β was substantially reduced, suggesting a requirement for Imp7 and Imp8 in nuclear import (Fig. 1, A and B). In the Drosophila cell line S2R+, the Smad4 ortholog Medea was largely excluded from the nucleus when overexpressed (Fig. 1C). Because immunostaining patterns for overexpressed proteins are usually heterogeneous, we categorized cells based on Medea staining patterns as predominantly cytoplasmic, even, or predominantly nuclear. The percentage of cells in each category provides quantitative measurement of nuclear translocation. Using this method, we found, as reported previously, that upon co-expression of Mad and the TGF-β receptor kinases Punt and Thickvien (Tkv), Medea was present predominantly in the nucleus of 68% of transfected cells (n > 150, Fig. 1C) (17Das P. Maduzia L. Wang H. Finelli A. Cho S.H. Smith M. Padgett R. Development. 1998; 125: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, when the Imp7/8 ortholog Msk was knocked down by RNAi, only 7% of the transfected cells contain Medea mostly in the nucleus (Fig. 1, C and D). As a second method to quantify nuclear import, we analyzed multiple confocal microscopic images (taken under the same conditions) using Image J to measure HA-Medea staining intensity per unit area in cytoplasm and nucleus. The calculated nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio (n = 20 in each case) also verified that Msk depletion impaired nuclear accumulation of Medea in cells activated by Punt/Tkv (Fig. 1C, N/C ratio). Therefore, in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, Imp7 and 8 are important for signal-induced nuclear accumulation of the Co-Smad, Smad4. We next tested whether the spontaneous, TGF-β-independent nuclear import of Smad4 also relies on Imp7 and 8. In 293T cells transfected with Flag-Smad4-encoding plasmids, Smad4 was predominantly in the cytoplasm in 95% of the cells (n > 300, see Fig. 2A for representative patterns). After treatment with LMB, in 57% of the cells Flag-Smad4 was predominantly in the nucleus; in 42% of them Flag-Smad4 concentration was equal in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, and only 1% of the cells still had Flag-Smad4 mostly in the cytoplasm. This clearly indicated a shift of Smad4 into the nucleus in the presence of LMB. Using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both Imp7 and 8, we verified that Imp7 or Imp8 was knocked down individually (Fig. 2B). More importantly, co-transfecting Flag-Smad4 with siRNA against either Imp7 or 8 led to substantially decreased percentage of cells exhibiting nuclear accumulation of Flag-Smad4 in response to LMB (Fig. 2C). The direct measurement of nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of Flag-Smad4 staining also indicated that LMB-induced nuclear import of Smad4 was decreased upon Imp7 or Imp8 knockdown (supplemental Table S1). Thus, the TGF-β-independent nuclear import of Smad4 also relied on Imp7 and 8. Subcellular Distribution of Smad7 Is Not Affected by Levels of Imp7 and 8—When overexpressed in 293T and HeLa cells, Smad7 was present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus with a higher concentration in the nucleus, consistent with previous reports (Fig. 2D and data not shown) (18Itoh S.

We wished to ascertain whether Imp7 or Imp8 might also take part in the nuclear import of Smad7. Co-transfection with siRNAs against Imp7 and/or 8 did not noticeably change the distribution pattern of Smad7, suggesting that Imp7 and 8 are not required for Smad7 import into the nucleus (Fig. 2D and supplemental Table S2). Moreover, we overexpressed Imp8 together with Smad7, and again we did not observe any changes in the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of Smad7 distribution (Fig. 2E). Therefore, we concluded that Imp7 and 8 were not critical regulators of Smad7 nuclear import. Imp8 Can Replace Imp7 in Mediating the Nuclear Import of Smad4—To verify that the siRNA effects were not due to off-target artifacts, we tested whether the import defects could be rescued by expressing silent mutants of Imp7 or 8 that are resistant to the siRNAs. This also allowed us to determine if the functions of Imp7 and 8 are interchangeable. We focused on nuclear import of Smad4 in LMB-treated cells. In Imp8 knockdown cells, overexpressing the siRNA-resistant Imp8 readily restored the nuclear import of Flag-Smad4, confirming the specificity of the RNAi result (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S3.). In contrast, when Imp7 was overexpressed, the import defect due to Imp8 depletion could not be rescued (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S3). Immunoblotting confirmed that overexpression of Imp7 was successful (Fig. 3A). Therefore, by itself Imp7 could not replace Imp8 to import Smad4. Furthermore, in cells with combined knockdown of Imp7 and Imp8, introducing siRNA-resistant Imp8, but not Imp7, was sufficient to reinstate nuclear accumulation of Smad4 upon LMB treatment (Fig. 3B and supplemental Table S4). It is important to note that overexpressing Imp8 did not increase the Imp7 protein level (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these knockdown and rescue experiments suggested that in basal state nuclear import of Smad4, Imp8 plays an irreplaceable role while Imp7 can be substituted by Imp8. Smads Preferentially Interact with Imp8—To evaluate the interaction between endogenous Smad4 and Imp7/8, we first carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiment using an antibody recognizing both Imp7 and 8. Indeed, Smad4 was co-immunoprecipitated from 293T cell extract using the anti-Imp7/8 antibody (Fig. 4A). Treatment with TGF-β did not affect the Smad4-Imp7/8 interaction to a significant degree, consistent with the notion that Imp8 mediates both the basal state and TGF-β-induced nuclear import of Smad4 (Fig. 4A). To examine if Smad4 has any preference in interacting with either Imp7 or Imp8, we transfected 293T cells with Flag-Smad4 and carried out anti-Flag immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, we detected only Imp8 in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4B, see the right panel for a better resolved immunoblot). Again, TGF-β treatment did not affect Imp8-Smad4 association (Fig. 4B). For comparison we tested Flag-Smad1 and Flag-Smad3, and indeed these two R-Smads also bound more strongly with endogenous Imp8 (Fig. 4C). These data suggested that the roles of Imp7 and Imp8 in Smad nuclear import are not equal, which also corroborate with the above observation that Imp8 was functionally irreplaceable by Imp7 in nuclear import of Smad4. Overexpression of Imp8 Is Sufficient to Drive Smad4 into the Nucleus Independent of TGF-β—When expressed in HeLa or 293T cells, Smad4 mostly resided in the cytoplasm, presumably because the CRM-1-mediated nuclear export dominated over the nuclear import (Fig. 5A). Upon co-transfection with Imp7, more cells now exhibited even distribution of Smad4 in- and outside of the nucleus, indicating enhanced nuclear import, but few cells could qualify as having Smad4 predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S1A). In contrast, overexpression of Imp8 had a much stronger effect, and in ∼70% of the cells, now Smad4 was predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S1A). Measuring the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of Flag-Smad4 staining also confirmed that Imp8 is much more potent in driving Smad4 into the nucleus (Fig. 5A, N/C ratio). Imp7 and Imp8 were expressed at comparable levels in these experiments judging by immunostaining and immunoblotting (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S1C). Therefore, these experiments once again suggested that Imp8 is a more potent nuclear import factor for Smad4 than Imp7. A Smad4 Motif Required but Not Sufficient for Imp8-mediated Nuclear Import—Previous studies have identified a Lysrich motif in the MH1 domain of Smad4 (45KKLKEKK51) that was necessary for Smad4 to accumulate in the nucleus upon treatment with LMB (15Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This motif is highly conserved in R- and Co-Smads in Drosophila and mammals (Fig. 5B). Despite its similarity to a classic nuclear localization signal (cNLS), previous studies have clearly indicated that this Lys-rich sequence in Smads is not a cNLS, which by definition should bind importin α (10Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Xu L. Alarcon C. Col S. Massagué J. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). When the first three Lys residues in this motif were mutated to Ala, overexpression of Imp8 or Imp7 could no longer drive this Smad4 mutant into the nucleus (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S1B). However, a Smad4 fragment (amino acids 1-63) containing this Lys-rich motif but not the nuclear export sequence (NES) was unable to target a heterologous protein EGFP into the nucleus, even with Imp8 overexpression (Fig. 5C), suggesting that this Lys-rich motif in Smad4 is not sufficient to mediate nuclear import through Imp8. Interestingly, the Lys-to-Ala mutation did not affect interaction between Smad4 and Imp8 when examined by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5D). This raised a possibility that the KKLK motif may serve a critical role in Smad4 nuclear import that is separate from interaction with Imp8. Msk Is Not Required for Basal State Nuclear Import of Medea in Drosophila Cells—The MH1 domain including the KKLK motif in Medea is highly homologous to that of its mammalian counterpart Smad4, but there is considerable divergence in the linker region, and there is an additional 26 amino acids at the N terminus of Medea. Even though data in Fig. 1 clearly suggested that Medea import in stimulated cells was dependent on the Imp7/8 ortholog Msk, we were interested in testing whether at basal state, without the complication of possible piggyback import together with phospho-Mad, nuclear import of Medea was also mediated by Msk. Like Smad4, Medea changed from mostly cytoplasmic to predominantly nuclear when cells were treated with LMB, indicating that both Smad4 and Medea are exported by CRM-1 (Fig. 6A). However, LMB-induced nuclear accumulation of Medea was entirely normal when Msk was depleted by RNAi (Fig. 6A). The efficacy of Msk RNAi was verified by immunostaining and that the nuclear import of Mad was severely affected (Fig. 6A and data not shown). Furthermore, we tested RNAi against all of the known karyopherin family members in Drosophila, and none appeared to be required for LMB-induced Medea import into the nucleus (data not shown). Moreover, when we overexpressed Msk, Medea still remained entirely cytoplasmic while in the control experiment nuclear import of Mad was clearly enhanced by Msk, further suggesting that Msk was not a critical factor in the basal state nuclear import of Medea (Fig. 6B). Therefore, although Medea and Smad4 are considered orthologs and both are exported by the same factor CRM-1, the spontaneous nuclear import at the basal state appeared to be mediated by completely different mechanisms. Given the data in Figs. 1C and 6 and the established fact that Medea complexes with Mad upon Mad phosphorylation, we reasoned that in stimulated Drosophila cells, phospho-Mad piggybacked Medea into the nucleus via Msk. Roles of Imp7 and 8 in Nuclear Import of R-Smads at Basal State—We next investigated whether overexpression of Imp7 or 8 would also alter R-Smad distribution in the absence of TGF-β. Flag-tagged Smad1, 2, and 3 were transfected into HeLa cells, with or without co-transfection of Imp7 or Imp8, and then examined by anti-Flag immunofluorescence staining. As in the above experiments, the nuclear versus cytoplasmic distribution was quantified with two different methods (Fig. 7A). Co-transfection with Imp7 had very limited effects on the distribution patterns of Smad1 and 3 (Fig. 7A). In contrast, Imp8 clearly enhanced the nuclear accumulation of Smad1 and Smad3 (Fig. 7A). Importantly, the overexpression level of Imp7 was actually higher than that of Imp8 in these experiments, suggesting that the differences in R-Smad import efficiency was not due to differential expression of Imp7 and Imp8 (supplemental Fig. S1C). In contrast to both Smad1 and Smad3, the pattern of Smad2 changed very little upon Imp8 overexpression, and most remained evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 7A). The same was also observed in 293T cells (data not shown). Therefore, among R-Smads, Imp8 is effective in importing Smad1 and Smad3, but much weaker for Smad2. Consistent with this, Smad2 did appear to interact more weakly with Imp8 in comparison to Smad3 (Fig. 7B). Smad1, 2, 3, and 4 have highly homologous MH1 domains, including the KKLK motif at relatively the same positions (Fig. 5B). As in Smad4, changing the KKLK sequence to AALA in Smad3 also prevented Imp8 from importing this mutant Smad3 into the nucleus (Fig. 7C and supplemental Table S5). Combining the data in Figs. 5, 6 and 7, we reached the conclusion that the KKLK motif is required, but not sufficient, for Imp8-mediated nuclear import of Smads at the basal state. Thus, there must be additional structural requirements in Smads that enable nuclear import via Imp8, and such structural elements are probably not present in Smad2 and Medea. We recently demonstrated that TGF-β-induced nuclear accumulation of R-Smads depended on Imp7/8 in both Drosophila and mammalian cells. Here we expanded the study to Co-Smad and I-Smad. Both gain- and loss-of-function analyses suggested a critical role of Imp8 in basal state and TGF-β-induced nuclear import of Smad4, while the subcellular distribution of Smad7 appeared to be independent of Imp7 and Imp8 regulation. Our data have now revealed that in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, the signal-induced nuclear accumulation of all R- and Co-Smads clearly require Msk/Imp7/8. On the other hand, for nuclear import in unstimulated cells, Msk/Imp7/8 is dispensable except in the case of Smad4. In addition, overexpression of Msk/Imp7/8 could enhance basal state nuclear import of some, but not all R- and Co-Smads. These observations support the idea that only selected members of the Smad family are direct import cargoes of Msk/Imp8, and different Smads utilize multiple import pathways for nuclear accumulation under different circumstances. Imp7 versus Imp8 in Smad Import—Msk is the only Imp7/8 ortholog in Drosophila and its evolution into Imp7 and Imp8 may reflect demand for cargo specification (20Baker S.E. Lorenzen J.A. Miller S.W. Bunch T.A. Jannuzi A.L. Ginsberg M.H. Perkins L.A. Brower D.L. Genetics. 2002; 162: 285-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Imp7 and Imp8 are nearly 80% homologous. The sequence similarity extends throughout the proteins, with the lowest homology in the last ∼100 amino acid residues (21Gorlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Only two previous studies examined Imp7 and Imp8 functions side-by-side. In the case of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), both Imp7 and Imp8 exhibited similar interaction with GR, but only Imp7 was able to import GR into the nucleus in vitro (22Freedman N.D. Yamamoto K.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2276-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In another study, the signal recognition particle protein 19 (SRP19) was shown to bind a number of importins with similar affinity including Imp7 and 8, and yet in the in vitro reconstituted assay, only Imp8 and transportin showed ability to import SRP19 (23Dean K.A. von Ahsen O. Gorlich D. Fried H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3479-3485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence arguing that the functions of Imp7 and Imp8 in Smad nuclear import are not exchangeable. This conclusion derives from three observations. In RNAi rescue experiments, overexpression of Imp7 could not overcome the deficiency in Imp8; whereas overexpression of Imp8 readily restored Smad4 nuclear import in Imp7 knockdown cells. Secondly, even though endogenous levels of Imp7 and 8 are similar, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, Smad1, Smad3, and Smad4 all interacted much more strongly with endogenous Imp8 than with Imp7. Thirdly, increased expression of Imp8 caused a dramatic redistribution of Smad1, Smad3, and Smad4 into the nucleus, but overexpression of Imp7 to a comparable level had a much weaker effect. Although RNAi experiments suggested that both Imp7 and Imp8 are required for nuclear accumulation of Smads to a similar degree, Imp7 and 8 may serve different roles in this process. Our data are most consistent with the notion that Imp7 and 8 have non-redundant roles and may participate in different aspects of Smad nuclear import. Structural Elements in Smads Required for Nuclear Import by Imp8—The KKLK sequence is conserved in Drosophila and mammalian R-Smads and Smad4, and mutation to AALA abrogated nuclear import of Smad4 and Smad3 (this report and Ref. 15Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, the KKLK motif is not sufficient to facilitate nuclear import of a heterologous protein. In addition, while the KKLK motif is present in Smad2 and Medea, these two Smads are not directly imported by Imp8/Msk. The precise function of the KKLK motif is still not clear. Mutating KKLK to AALA did not affect Imp8 interaction with Smad4. One interpretation is that the KKLK motif is critical for Smad4 import at the steps after Imp8 association. Alternatively, the Imp8-Smad4 interaction involves the KKLK and other domains, but the KKLK sequence is required for an interaction with Imp8 that would generate an import-competent configuration. Indeed there are many examples in which binding to an importin does not result in actual nuclear import (22Freedman N.D. Yamamoto K.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2276-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 24Jakel S. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 25Jakel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It is also possible that another factor binding the KKLK motif is crucial for nuclear import of Smads. For Smad2, the interaction with Imp8 was also significantly weaker when compared with Smad3. The C-terminal MH2 domains of Smad2 and Smad3 are almost identical, so the differences between the two in terms of Imp8 interaction and nuclear import is likely to reside within the MH1 and the linker region. This is also the region in R-Smads where interaction with Imp8 was mapped (9Xu L. Yao X. Chen X. Lu P. Zhang B. Ip Y.T. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The MH1 domains are relatively conserved among all Smads but the linkers are much more divergent. Further investigation is needed to determine precisely what structural elements distinguish Smad2 and Medea from the rest of R- and Co-Smads in their ability to be imported by Imp8 or Msk. In the meantime, questions also arise about how Smad2 and Medea are imported into the nucleus. It is very possible that under TGF-β stimulation, since R-Smads and Co-Smad form complexes, they could be co-imported. Indeed, RNAi experiments clearly demonstrated that Smad2 and Medea import in response to TGF-β activation was dependent on Imp8 and Msk, respectively (9Xu L. Yao X. Chen X. Lu P. Zhang B. Ip Y.T. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At the basal state, Smad2 may be able to enter the nucleus through a previously described importin-independent mechanism that depends on interaction with nucleoporins (7Xu L. Kang Y. Col S. Massagué J. Mol Cell. 2002; 10: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 10Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to propose that Medea can be imported through a similar mechanism because Smad4 was shown to bind nucleoporins as well (11Xu L. Alarcon C. Col S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42569-42577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At present, we favor the notion that there are multiple parallel pathways for importing R-Smads and Co-Smads into the nucleus at the basal state; on the other hand upon TGF-β stimulation, Imp8/Msk is the rate-limiting factor in nuclear import of all R- and Co-Smads. A possible exception is that phospho-Smad2 homotrimers may enter the nucleus through different mechanisms in response to TGF-β, without the involvement of Imp8. The Balance of Smad Nuclear Import and Export Forces—When overexpressed in HeLa or 293T cells, Smad1, Smad3, and Smad4 display different distribution patterns, probably reflecting the sum of counteracting nuclear import and export forces. In all three cases, overexpression of Imp8 was sufficient to cause redistribution of these Smads into the nucleus. It is interesting to note that the level of endogenous Imp8 is apparently sufficient for TGF-β-induced nuclear import of R- and Co-Smads, but clearly not enough to counteract the export factors without TGF-β stimulation. Although it remains to be determined if Imp8 activity can be enhanced by TGF-β, current data seem to support the hypothesis that TGF-β facilitates nuclear accumulation of R-Smads and Smad4 mainly by suppressing their nuclear export activities (8Schmierer B. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9845-9858Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Chen H.B. Rud J.G. Lin K. Xu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21329-21336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Collectively, our observations suggest an important role for Imp8 in nuclear translocation of Smad4, in addition to R-Smads. It will be interesting to further investigate how the functions of Imp8 in Smad import could be regulated. We thank Dr. R.

https://openalex.org/W2017617217,"Some pathogens are capable of suppressing the melanization response of host insects, but the virulence factors responsible are largely unknown. The insect pathogen Microplitis demolitor bracovirus encodes the Egf family of small serine proteinase inhibitors. One family member, Egf1.0, was recently shown to suppress melanization of hemolymph in Manduca sexta in part by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of prophenoloxidase activating proteinase 3 (PAP3). However, other experiments suggested this viral protein suppresses melanization by more than one mechanism. Here we report that Egf1.0 inhibited the amidolytic activity of PAP1 and dose-dependently blocked processing of pro-PAP1 and pro-PAP3. Consistent with its PAP inhibitory activity, Egf1.0 also prevented processing of pro-phenoloxidase, serine proteinase homolog (SPH) 1, and SPH2. Isolation of Egf1.0-protein complexes from plasma indicated that Egf1.0 binds PAPs through its C-terminal repeat domain. Egf1.0 also potentially interacts with SPH2 and two other proteins, ferritin and gloverin, not previously associated with the phenoloxidase cascade. Overall, our results indicate that Egf1.0 is a dual activity PAP inhibitor that strongly suppresses the insect melanization response."
https://openalex.org/W1990425731,"The safener fenclorim (4,6-dichloro-2-phenylpyrimidine) increases tolerance to chloroacetanilide herbicides in rice by enhancing the expression of detoxifying glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Fenclorim also enhances GSTs in Arabidopsis thaliana, and while investigating the functional significance of this induction in suspension cultures, we determined that these enzymes glutathionylated the safener. The resulting S-(fenclorim)-glutathione conjugate was sequentially processed to S-(fenclorim)-gamma-glutamyl-cysteine and S-(fenclorim)-cysteine (FC), the latter accumulating in both the cells and the medium. FC was then either catabolized to 4-chloro-6-(methylthio)-phenylpyrimidine (CMTP) or N-acylated with malonic acid. These cysteine derivatives had distinct fates, with the enzymes responsible for their formation being induced by fenclorim and FC. Fenclorim-N-malonylcysteine was formed from FC by the action of a malonyl-CoA-dependent N-malonyltransferase. A small proportion of the fenclorim-N-malonylcysteine then underwent decarboxylation to yield a putative S-fenclorim-N-acetylcysteine intermediate, which underwent a second round of GST-mediated S-glutathionylation and subsequent proteolytic processing. The formation of CMTP was catalyzed by the concerted action of a cysteine conjugate beta-lyase and an S-methyltransferase, with the two activities being coordinately regulated. Although the fenclorim conjugates tested showed little GST-inducing activity in Arabidopsis, the formation of CMTP resulted in metabolic reactivation, with the product showing good enhancing activity. In addition, CMTP induced GSTs and herbicide-safening activity in rice. The bioactivated CMTP was in turn glutathione-conjugated and processed to a malonyl cysteine derivative. These results reveal the surprisingly complex set of competing catabolic reactions acting on xenobiotics entering the S-glutathionylation pathway in plants, which can result in both detoxification and bioactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1982021390,"Recent evidence indicates that insulin resistance in skeletal muscle may be related to reduce mitochondrial number and oxidation capacity. However, it is not known whether increasing mitochondrial number and function improves insulin resistance. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a combination of nutrients on insulin resistance and mitochondrial biogenesis/function in skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats.We demonstrated that defect of glucose and lipid metabolism is associated with low mitochondrial content and reduced mitochondrial enzyme activity in skeletal muscle of the diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats. The treatment of combination of R-alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, nicotinamide, and biotin effectively improved glucose tolerance, decreased the basal insulin secretion and the level of circulating free fatty acid (FFA), and prevented the reduction of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. The nutrients treatment also significantly increased mRNA levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (Ppar alpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (Ppar delta), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (Mcpt-1) and activity of mitochondrial complex I and II in skeletal muscle. All of these effects of mitochondrial nutrients are comparable to that of the antidiabetic drug, pioglitazone. In addition, the treatment with nutrients, unlike pioglitazone, did not cause body weight gain.These data suggest that a combination of mitochondrial targeting nutrients may improve skeletal mitochondrial dysfunction and exert hypoglycemic effects, without causing weight gain."

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4338-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the case of effector caspase activation, this switchlike response was shown to emanate as a systems property from feedback signaling loops in the caspase activation network (13Rehm M. Huber H.J. Dussmann H. Prehn J.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4338-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Legewie S. Bluthgen N. Herzel H. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e120Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the intracellular signaling dynamics during apoptosis initiation leading to the kinetically invariant activation of MOMP. Especially, since it is conceivable that at both physiological and therapeutic conditions, cells can be exposed to TRAIL receptor ligands over a wide range of different concentrations, it is unclear how this variability can be translated into a clear cell death decision. Here, we address this question by using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach to monitor the real time kinetics of caspase-8/-10 activation and activity via the TRAIL receptor pathway using single cell time lapse imaging. We found that TRAIL exposure induced dose-dependent kinetics of caspase-8/-10 activation and activity. We furthermore identified a threshold mechanism that permits us to integrate such differential caspase activities into an all-or-none decision of apoptosis execution. Importantly, we performed these analyses excluding the potential contribution of high abundant downstream effector caspases with similar substrate specificities. Materials—Embryo-tested mineral oil and cycloheximide (CHX) were from Sigma. TRAIL was from Leinco Technologies (St. Louis, MO). Tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM) was from MobiTec (Göttingen). Staurosporine (STS) was from Alexis (San Diego, CA). The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(O-methyl)-fmk was purchased from Bachem (St Helen's, UK). G418 was from Invitrogen. Molecular Cloning of the IETD FRET Probe—A DEVDase-responsive enhanced CFP-DEVD-Venus FRET cassette was obtained from pSCAT3 (15Takemoto K. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Miura M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (a generous gift of Masayuki Miura, RIKEN Brain Research Institute, Wako, Saitama, Japan) by digestion with BamHI and HindIII. This was subcloned into pTK-RL (Promega, WI), digested at the same sites, and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biologicals/Amersham Biosciences). The resulting plasmid was digested with SacI and KpnI to remove the DEVDase substrate cassette and ligated with excess annealed oligonucleotides, forming an IETDase substrate cassette. This IETD cassette was generated using the following complementary oligonucleotides 5′-G AGC GGA ATC GAG ACC GAT GGTAC-3′ and 5′-C ATC GGT CTC GAT TCC GCT CAGCT-3′. This generated a cassette consisting of a coding sequence for IETD flanked NH2-terminally by a flexible glycine-serine dipeptide and COOH-terminally by a KpnI site (encoding glycine-threonine) and a flexible serine-glycine-serine tripeptide. The oligonucleotide sequences immediately adjacent to the overhangs were designed to destroy the SacI site upon ligation with corresponding vector overhangs and to generate a diagnostic PvuII site to exclude multiple concatenated oligonucleotides. The resulting pTK-reverse SCAT8 vector was digested with BamHI and HindIII to obtain the enhanced CFP-IETD-Venus FRET cassette. This was ligated into pcDNA3.1 vector to generate pSCAT8. Cell Culture and Transfection—All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin (100 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). Cells were transfected with 500 ng of pSCAT8 plasmid DNA, and 4 μl of Metafecten (Biontex Laboratories, Munich, Germany) per milliliter of serum-free medium at 37 °C for 4 h. For the generation of stable cell lines, cells were selected in the presence of 50 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 3-4 weeks, and fluorescent clones were enriched. Generation of Stable Bid-depleted Cells—Three different short hairpin RNA sequences specific for human Bid mRNA were designed using the Dharmacon siRNA design tool (available on the World Wide Web). The following 19-nucleotide sequences were chosen and subjected to BLAST analysis to avoid significant homology to other human genes: Bid-1 sense (5′-AAGCTGTTCTGACAACAGC-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 78-97 downstream of the Bid mRNA start codon; Bid-2 sense (5′-AAGGAGAAGACCATGCTGG-3′), homologous to nucleotides 430-449; and Bid-3 sense (5′-AAGAATAGAGGCAGATTCT-3′, spanning nucleotides 210-229. The Bid-specific short hairpin RNA duplexes along with a scrambled control sequence were ligated into the pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro vector (Ambion, Cambridgeshire, UK) via their BamHI and HindIII sites. To generate stable knockdown cell lines, HeLa cells were transfected with the different short hairpin RNA constructs using Metafectene (Biontex, Munich, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were serially diluted and transferred to 96-well plates, and stable clones were selected using hygromycin B (160 μg/ml). Bid expression in HeLa cells stably expressing Bid siRNA was compared with the Bid expression in parental HeLa cells by Western blotting, and the clone with the strongest Bid depletion was selected for this study. After background subtraction, chemiluminescence intensities from n = 3 independent whole cell protein extracts were densitometrically measured using AlphaEase FC software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Adenoviral Infection—The generation of adenoviruses for XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) expression and control viruses and the infection procedure were described previously (13Rehm M. Huber H.J. Dussmann H. Prehn J.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4338-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16Eberhardt O. Coelln R.V. Kugler S. Lindenau J. Rathke-Hartlieb S. Gerhardt E. Haid S. Isenmann S. Gravel C. Srinivasan A. Bahr M. Weller M. Dichgans J. Schulz J.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9126-9134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, parental and Bid-depleted HeLa cells expressing the SCAT8 FRET probe were grown on WillCo dishes (Willco BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1000 in serum-free medium for 2 h and subsequently cultured in full growth medium. Experiments were carried out >24 h postinfection. Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts and Western Blotting—Cells were collected at 1000 rpm for 3 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerin, 2% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and heated at 95 °C for 20 min. Protein content was determined with the Pierce Micro-BCA protein assay (Pierce). An equal amount of protein (20 μg) was loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were separated at 100 V for 2.5 h and then blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Protean BA 83; 2 μm; Schleicher & Schuell) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol (v/v), and 0.01% SDS) at 18 V for 60 min. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were incubated with the following antibodies: a rabbit polyclonal caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), a mouse monoclonal caspase-8 antibody (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), a mouse monoclonal green fluorescent protein antibody (Clontech), a goat polyclonal Bid antibody (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), a mouse monoclonal α-tubulin antibody (Sigma), and a mouse monoclonal β-actin antibody (Sigma). Membranes were washed with TBST three times for 5 min and incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h. Blots were washed and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence was detected at 12-bit dynamic range using a Fuji LAS 3000 CCD system (Fujifilm UK Ltd., Bedfordshire, UK). Determination of Caspase-3-like Protease Activity—After exposure to staurosporine, TRAIL/CHX, or vehicle, culture medium was aspirated, and cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 42 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Fifty microliters of this extract were added to 150 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 3 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction buffer was supplemented with 10 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC, the preferred fluorigenic substrate for effector caspase-3 and -7. Production of fluorescent AMC was monitored over 120 min using a fluorescent plate reader (excitation 360 nm, emission 465 nm). Autofluorescence of blanks containing lysis buffer only were subtracted. Protein content was determined using the Pierce Coomassie (Bradford) protein assay kit (Pierce). Caspase activity was expressed as change in fluorescent units/h/μg of protein. Epifluorescence Microscopy and Digital Imaging—Cells were cultivated on 12-mm glass bottom dishes (Willco BV) in 1 ml of medium at least overnight to let them attach firmly. Cells were equilibrated with 30 nm TMRM in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum, buffered with HEPES (10 mm; pH 7.4), covered with mineral oil, and placed in a heated (37 °C) incubation chamber that was mounted on the microscope stage. Cells were treated on stage with 1 μm STS or 10-1000 ng/ml TRAIL plus 1 μg/ml CHX. Fluorescence was observed using an Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope equipped with a ×40 numerical aperture 1.3 oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), polychroic mirror, and filter wheels in the excitation and emission light path containing the appropriate filter sets (cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), excitation 436 ± 10 nm, emission 480 ± 20 nm; YFP, excitation 500 ± 10 nm, emission 535 ± 15 nm; FRET, excitation 436 ± 10 nm, emission 535 ± 30 nm; TMRM, excitation 530 ± 25 nm, emission 592.5 ± 22.5 nm; dichroic mirrors for CFP (FRET), YFP, and TMRM; Semrock (Rochester, NY)). Images were recorded using a back-illuminated, cooled electron multiplying CCD camera (Andor Ixon BV 887-DCS, Andor Technologies, Belfast, Northern Ireland). The imaging setup was controlled by MetaMorph 7.1r1 software (Molecular Devices Ltd., Wokingham, UK). Confocal Microscopy and Acceptor Bleaching—To confirm resonance energy transfer within the IETD FRET probe, the acceptor Venus was bleached, and the donor dequenching was analyzed. HeLa cells expressing the FRET probe were placed on the heated stage of an LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat ×63 numerical aperture 1.4 oil immersion differential interference contrast objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The emission spectra were recorded at 10.3-nm step size using the 405-nm laser line (attenuated to 1.0%), and the 405/514 multichroic beamsplitter and the Meta detector in the range of 442-614 nm. Following each cycle of bleach scans with the nonattenuated 514 argon laser line (laser was run at 50% of its maximal power), spectral images were recorded. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨM) and FRET Disruption—After background subtraction, the cellular TMRM fluorescence intensity was calculated for each cell. Caspase cleavage kinetics were detected at the single-cell level by FRET analysis, as described previously (12Rehm M. Dussmann H. Janicke R.U. Tavare J.M. Kogel D. Prehn J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24506-24514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Images were processed using MetaMorph 7.1r1 software (Molecular Devices Ltd., Wokingham, UK). CFP/YFP and FRET/YFP emission ratio traces were obtained by dividing the fluorescence intensity values in the CFP and FRET channels by the YFP emission of single cells after background subtraction. The ratiometric readout automatically corrects for nonspecific changes in fluorescence intensities that affect all channels in parallel, such as slight drifts in optical focus or cellular movements. Statistics—Data are given as means ± S.D. or S.E. For statistical comparison, Student's t test or analysis of variance and subsequent Tukey's test were used for normal distributed data. Otherwise, Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis H test were used. p values smaller than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Kruskal-Wallis H tests returning statistical significances were subsequently followed up with Bonferroni adjusted Mann-Whitney U tests. Acceptor Bleaching Confirms Resonance Energy Transfer in a New IETDase FRET Probe—Previously, recombinant FRET probes based on green fluorescent protein variants were successfully employed to analyze effector caspase activity in single living cells (12Rehm M. Dussmann H. Janicke R.U. Tavare J.M. Kogel D. Prehn J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24506-24514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 13Rehm M. Huber H.J. Dussmann H. Prehn J.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4338-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 15Takemoto K. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Miura M. J.

Here, we developed a new FRET probe based on CFP and Venus, an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein, which are interconnected by a short linker containing a preferred caspase-8/-10 recognition site IETD (18Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 19McStay G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Upon CFP excitation, energy is transferred to the acceptor fluorophore Venus (Fig. 1A). Cleavage of the linker disrupts the resonance energy transfer as the distance between donor and acceptor increases and results in enhanced CFP emission (Fig. 1B). The probe was generated from a previously described FRET probe template for effector caspases, which provided a very high signal/noise ratio upon proteolytic cleavage (15Takemoto K. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Miura M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This high signal/noise ratio facilitates the detection of low caspase activities as expected in the case of caspase-8/-10 during apoptosis initiation. Efficient resonance energy transfer was observed when expressing the IETD FRET probe in HeLa cervical cancer cells; upon photobleaching the acceptor fluorophore Venus in individual cells, CFP emission significantly increased, as observed in cellular fluorescence emission profiles (Fig. 1, C-F). Bid Depletion Can Prevent Apoptosis Execution but Not IETD Probe Cleavage following TRAIL Exposure—Biochemically, it has been shown that besides caspase-8 and -10, downstream effector caspase-3 and -6 can cleave IETD recognition sites as well (19McStay G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Similar overlapping specificities were reported for synthetic caspase inhibitors, such as IETD- and DEVD-fmk, effectively preventing the selective inhibition of individual caspases (18Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 19McStay G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Using the above described new IETD FRET probe, we therefore investigated whether we could establish a model system that enabled us to temporally separate the downstream execution phase from caspase-8/-10-dependent signaling during the initiation phase of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. HeLa cells are type II signaling cells and consequently depend on the mitochondrial pathway for the activation of effector caspases during death receptor-induced apoptosis (20Engels I.H. Stepczynska A. Stroh C. Lauber K. Berg C. Schwenzer R. Wajant H. Janicke R.U. Porter A.G. Belka C. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4563-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We generated HeLa cells stably depleted of Bid expression by siRNA transfection to impair MOMP and subsequent effector caspase activation (Fig. 2A). Bid expression was reduced to ∼4.5 ± 3.0% of the wild type expression level as densitometrically quantified from Western blots. To investigate whether Bid depletion was sufficient to impair effector caspase activation during death receptor-induced apoptosis, we next biochemically characterized the response of parental and Bid-depleted HeLa cells to TRAIL/CHX (hereafter referred to as TRAIL) and intrinsic apoptosis stimulus STS. TRAIL was administered in combination with 1 μg/ml CHX to suppress the activation of translation-dependent survival signaling in response to TRAIL exposure (3Falschlehner C. Emmerich C.H. Gerlach B. Walczak H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 1462-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In both parental and Bid-depleted cells, procaspase-8 was processed into active subunits with apparently identical kinetics in response to TRAIL (Fig. 2B). Although parental cells can activate caspase-3, Bid-depleted HeLa cells did not show any reduction in procaspase-3, and active subunits were only detected in minute amounts (Fig. 2, B and C). To analyze whether the observed caspase-3 processing results in caspase-3-like activity, we employed fluorigenic DEVD-AMC substrate assays. In these assays, Bid depleted HeLa cells exhibited massively reduced cleavage rates following death receptor stimulation with TRAIL, suggesting that downstream apoptosis execution is significantly inhibited in these cells (Fig. 2D). In contrast, Bid depletion did not influence the activation of caspase-3 or caspase-8 (Fig. 2E), which is largely activated downstream of caspase-3 during STS-induced apoptosis (20Engels I.H. Stepczynska A. Stroh C. Lauber K. Berg C. Schwenzer R. Wajant H. Janicke R.U. Porter A.G. Belka C. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4563-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); nor was caspase-3 like activity significantly affected in fluorigenic assays (Fig. 2F). Next, we tested whether the IETD FRET probe can still be cleaved in Bid-depleted cells during TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Following TRAIL exposure, the full-length probe was cleaved into fragments corresponding to the molecular sizes of CFP linker and Venus, as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 2G). The addition of caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fmk blocked FRET substrate cleavage, showing this to be a caspase-dependent process (Fig. 2G). Taken together, these results show that Bid depletion efficiently inhibited apoptosis execution in response to TRAIL addition. Bid depletion, however, did not impair the processing of procaspase-8; nor did it prevent IETD FRET probe cleavage. TRAIL-induced Caspase-8-like Activities Can Persist for Hours without Causing Immediate Apoptotic Cell Death in Bid-depleted HeLa Cells—To analyze profiles of caspase-8-like activities in single living cells by time lapse imaging, we then expressed the IETD FRET probe in the Bid-depleted HeLa cells. Following administration of TRAIL, we observed that probe cleavage began individually in single cells rather than it being a synchronous response throughout the whole population in the field of view (Fig. 3A). Probe cleavage was detected as an intensity increase in the CFP/YFP emission ratio images (Fig. 3A) and a decrease in FRET/YFP emission ratio images (not shown). Previous studies in HeLa cells have shown a loss in ΔΨM in response to MOMP-induced cytochrome c release (9Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 11Rehm M. Dussmann H. Prehn J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Dussmann H.

Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Using TMRM as a ΔΨM-sensitive dye in parallel with the FRET probe, we found that in Bid-depleted cells, mitochondria either did not depolarize (Fig. 3A) or depolarized only at very late times during or after FRET probe cleavage (not shown). Importantly, classical apoptotic morphology, such as cellular shrinkage or membrane blebbing could not be observed as long as the cells did not depolarize. Corresponding to our biochemical analyses (Fig. 2), this indicates that MOMP-dependent mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis execution are efficiently inhibited by Bid depletion. We next plotted the CFP/YFP and FRET/YFP emission ratios of individual Bid-depleted cells to graphically follow substrate cleavage over time. Probe cleavage began following an initial lag time, as observed by an increase in the CFP/YFP and a concomitant decrease in the FRET/YFP ratios (Fig. 3B). In response to 100 ng/ml TRAIL, probe cleavage on average began 56 ± 25 min after drug addition and lasted for 5.5 ± 2.8 h (data are mean ± S.D. from n = 20 cells analyzed). To exclude the possibility that type I-like direct activation of caspase-3 by caspase-8/-10 contributed to the activity measured (4Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar), in additional control experiments we employed adenoviral overexpression of XIAP, the most efficient intracellular inhibitor of downstream caspase-3, -7, and -9. XIAP overexpression did not affect IET-Dase activity in Bid-depleted cells in response to TRAIL (supplemental Fig. 1). These findings demonstrate that HeLa cells individually activate IETDases in response to TRAIL exposure and that this caspase-8-like activity can be a surprisingly stable response that can persist for hours without causing immediate apoptotic cell death. TRAIL-induced Profiles of Caspase-8-like Activities Upstream of MOMP in Parental HeLa Cells—We next analyzed caspase-8-like activities in parental HeLa cells following TRAIL exposure. In contrast to Bid-depleted cells, we observed that parental HeLa cells cleaving the FRET probe subsequently underwent cellular condensation and membrane blebbing characteristic of apoptotic cell death (Fig. 4A).

https://openalex.org/W1978279802,"Nature is governed by local interactions among lower-level sub-units, whether at the cell, organ, organism, or colony level. Adaptive system behaviour emerges via these interactions, which integrate the activity of the sub-units. To understand the system level it is necessary to understand the underlying local interactions. Successful models of local interactions at different levels of biological organisation, including epithelial tissue and ant colonies, have demonstrated the benefits of such 'agent-based' modelling. Here we present an agent-based approach to modelling a crucial biological system--the intracellular NF-kappaB signalling pathway. The pathway is vital to immune response regulation, and is fundamental to basic survival in a range of species. Alterations in pathway regulation underlie a variety of diseases, including atherosclerosis and arthritis. Our modelling of individual molecules, receptors and genes provides a more comprehensive outline of regulatory network mechanisms than previously possible with equation-based approaches. The method also permits consideration of structural parameters in pathway regulation; here we predict that inhibition of NF-kappaB is directly affected by actin filaments of the cytoskeleton sequestering excess inhibitors, therefore regulating steady-state and feedback behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2056739666,"Rheb (Ras-homolog enriched in brain) is a component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway, functioning as a positive regulator of TOR. Constitutively active mutants of Rheb induce oncogenic transformation in cell culture. The transformed cells are larger and contain more protein than their normal counterparts. They show constitutive phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, two downstream targets of TOR. The TOR-specific inhibitor rapamycin strongly interferes with transformation induced by constitutively active Rheb, suggesting that TOR activity is essential for the oncogenic effects of mutant Rheb. Rheb-induced transformation is also dependent on a C-terminal farnesylation signal that mediates localization to a cellular membrane. An engineered N-terminal myristylation signal can substitute for the farnesylation. Immunofluorescence localizes wild-type and mutant Rheb to vesicular structures in the cytoplasm, overlapping with the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2068426891,"Human embryonic stem cell research has elicited powerful debates about the morality of destroying human embryos. However, there are important ethical issues related to stem cell research that are unrelated to embryo destruction. These include particular issues involving different types of cells used, the procurement of such cells, in vivo use of stem cells, intellectual property, and conflicts of interest. Human embryonic stem cell research has elicited powerful debates about the morality of destroying human embryos. However, there are important ethical issues related to stem cell research that are unrelated to embryo destruction. These include particular issues involving different types of cells used, the procurement of such cells, in vivo use of stem cells, intellectual property, and conflicts of interest. Research with human embryonic stem cells has been inextricably associated with ethical, social, and political debates across the globe. Although some of these debates relate to the integrity of research, arguably the most vociferous and strident debates have involved moral questions regarding the destruction of human embryos to derive stem cells. Amidst this continuing controversy, recent reports by different teams of scientists regarding the possibility of reprogramming cells to create induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Holden and Vogel, 2008Holden C. Vogel G. Science. 2008; 319: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have captured the imaginations of scientists and society. Although some accounts in the popular media suggest that the ethical issues associated with stem cell research will be resolved based on these results, because their derivation does not involve destroying embryos, such suggestions neglect scientific arguments for continuing stem cell research with embryos. Setting aside for a moment the particular issues related to research and iPSCs, the recent reports and discussion surrounding them make it at least plausible to imagine a day when there isn't a compelling scientific call to create stem cells from human embryos. If and when that occurs, will all the relevant ethical debates and considerations regarding research and treatment with stem cells be resolved? Unfortunately, they will not. In fact, there is a set of more subtle, yet serious, ethical concerns that are embedded in stem cell research. Accordingly, in this paper, I describe some of the ethical issues that are relevant to stem cell research and treatment that are not related to concerns about the embryo. It is important to acknowledge that, although many of these issues have been raised elsewhere, previous discussions have tended to deal with them in isolation. My hope is that by highlighting the range and nature of these issues, those engaged in stem cell research and its oversight may be better prepared to examine and navigate them in the context of basic and translational research. Such an approach should enhance the likelihood that some of the promises of stem cell research will be realized into safe and effective therapies. I also encourage individuals engaged in stem cell research to continue to develop and adhere to ethical guidelines that reflect the nature of this rapidly moving field. There are particular considerations depending on the types of cells collected and used for stem cell research and treatment, including umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, and other somatic cells. Many of these considerations have been described in different literatures, but reviewing them in aggregate suggests some crosscutting concerns regarding the use of human tissue for stem cell research. Further, awareness of the concerns and how they have been managed with respect to particular cell types may provide useful lessons and analogies for other cell types. An assumption by some involved with cord blood collection is that the placenta would be considered waste save for the use of placental and cord blood. Although this may be true for a majority of persons in some parts of the globe, this may not be true in others (Jenkins and Sugarman, 2005Jenkins G.L. Sugarman J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2005; 145: 118-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Indeed, there are wide variety of beliefs and practices regarding the proper treatment and disposition of the placenta that can have profound implications for those being asked to have cord blood collected. For example, in some cultures, the placenta may be ingested by the mother after delivery or it may be used in a variety of ceremonial practices that can include burial or desiccation. In addition to such cultural concerns, there are additional implications for pregnant women and donors (Kurtzberg et al., 2005Kurtzberg J. Lyerly A.D. Sugarman J. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2592-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). First are a set of questions regarding the appropriate timing of consent. Obviously, labor and delivery are not ideal times for deliberation and careful decision making! Ideally then, parents would provide consent for collection in advance of labor and delivery. However, this may not be feasible due to when and where some women access prenatal care. In some cord blood banking centers, clinicians obtain “miniconsent” solely for the collection of cord blood at the time of delivery. Then, subsequent consent is obtained for testing and banking. Second, if cord blood will be banked for potential use, it is typically necessary to quarantine collected units to ensure that they are free from transmissible disease, such as HIV and hepatitis, so that they do not cause harm to recipients. Nevertheless, the testing of a newborn's blood for transmissible diseases may create unanticipated and inadvertent harms related to privacy. Similarly, suppose researchers tested banked cord blood for adult onset disorders. What should be done with the results of such testing? Should parents have access to such test results even if nothing can be done in childhood to avert the onset of the disorder later in life? Would parents somehow treat differently the child with such a result? Third, many parents have the option of either private cord blood banking, in which cord blood is stored for use in their families and at their expense, and public banking, in which cord blood is donated and stored as a public resource at no cost to the parents. Concerns that have been raised about private banking include whether it is acceptable to market banking services if it is currently unlikely that the material will be used, whether marketing of units of cord blood is acceptable, and the disposition of cord blood should storage fees go unpaid. The harvesting of bone marrow poses obvious pain and risks to the donor. Risks include those related to anesthesia and physical damage coincident to harvesting. Further, a range of cases have been encountered involving the harvesting of bone marrow for use in transplantation that raises important ethical questions. For example, consider the relative who is asked to donate but doesn't feel comfortable doing so or who knows about some medical contraindication to donation (such as being HIV positive) that she does not wish to share with her family. Although such a person would not be eligible to be a donor, how this private information is handled can be difficult for the person believed to be a potential donor as well as for clinicians. Consider also the now famous Ayala case, in which a child was conceived with the hope that she would be a suitable donor for her sibling who stood to benefit from a bone marrow transplant. Ultimately, she was and a transplant was successful (Boyle and Savulescu, 2001Boyle R.J. Savulescu J. BMJ. 2001; 323: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, this case and those similar to it raise important issues related to the appropriate use of sibling donors who are children. Furthermore, the systems used to identify bone marrow donors are associated with a set of issues related to justice or fairness, especially in regard to the ability to provide suitable donors for patients who are members of racial and ethnic minority communities. The collection of other somatic cells (such as adipocytes, hepatocytes, and skin cells) from adults raises some discrete but, at least to date, manageable issues. To be sure the collection of adipocytes and hepatocytes incurs certain discomfort and some discernable physical risk; yet most adults should be capable of providing meaningful informed consent for such collections. Nevertheless, informed consent for such collections, as well as the collection of skin cells by means of a punch biopsy intended for use in developing iPSCs for research, needs to ensure that patients who are asked to provide specimens for the creation of stem cell lines not harbor unrealistic expectations regarding the likelihood that a cell line will certainly be produced and, if so, that it will ultimately redound in personal benefit to them (Hyun, 2008Hyun I. Stem cells from skin cells.Hastings Cent. Rep. 2008; 38: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, when there is intent to create iPSCs, using as an analogy the accepted provisions that have emerged regarding the use of human embryos to create stem cells (Committee on Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Research, National Research Council, 2005Committee on Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Research, National Research CouncilGuidelines for human embryonic stem cell research. National Academies Press, Washington, DC2005Google Scholar, Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research Advisory Committee, National Research Council, 2007Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research Advisory Committee, National Research Council2007 Amendments to the National Academies' Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research. National Academies Press, Washington, DC2007Google Scholar; see also the International Society for Stem Cell Research [ISSCR] guidelines), it is essential that the informed consent process include similar information. For example, donors must understand that their cells may be used to create immortalized cell lines with future uses that may be unclear and include the possibility of in vivo experimentation, genetic manipulation, transfer to other institutions, and commercial potential. The lingering concerns of the family members of the person from whom the HeLa cell line was created underscores this point (Gold, 1986Gold M. A conspiracy of cells: one woman's immortal legacy and the medical scandal it caused. SUNY Press, Albany, NY1986Google Scholar, Washington, 1994Washington H.A. Emerge. 1994; 6: 29Google Scholar). In addition, once cell lines have been created, it may be impossible for donors to meaningfully withdraw consent for use. Further, the extent to which identifiable information about the donor will be maintained should be clarified. Additionally, it appears that it is far easier to derive iPSCs than to develop hESC lines, given in part to that fact that obtaining the necessary cellular materials does not require access to human embryos or oocytes. Although this may prove to be beneficial because easier derivation may make diversity and relative scarcity of stem cells less of an issue, concerns have been raised about their ready use for types of science that raise additional sets of ethical questions (Cyranoski, 2008Cyranoski D. Nature. 2008; 452: 406-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For instance, such cells may be used in an effort to derive embryonic germ cells with a hope of ultimately using gametes derived from them for the treatment of infertility. As part of this endeavor, attempts would likely be made to create embryos in the research and treatment process, again raising ethical questions about the embryo. Of course, these questions could arise with other types of stem cells from different sources, provided it is technically possible to derive germ cells from them, but the ready availability of skin cells from those with infertility may make the iPSC approach seem advantageous. Given that informed consent is now expected for most medical research and treatment, it is not surprising that informed consent would be expected for procuring cells used for stem cell research and treatment (see ISSCR guidelines). Regardless of the setting, at a very basic level informed consent requires that the person being asked to provide this consent be capable of engaging in the consent process, both in terms of their decision-making capacity and ability to make a voluntary decision. If so, they must be given relevant information about what is being asked in a manner in which they can understand it. So, as described earlier, labor and delivery can potentially compromise the ability to provide informed consent due to decision-making capacity at that time, or being a graduate student or lab worker may undermine the ability to make a voluntary choice. It is beyond the scope of this paper to outline all the relevant information to be disclosed during the informed consent process for each type of procurement. However, in addition to information regarding the procedures for procurement and the associated risks (physical and social), issues related to future uses, intellectual property, ownership, and control over cell lines and their derivatives should be incorporated into the consent process. Privacy is another crosscutting issue coupled to cell procurement because it is generally important to keep identifiers when there is a hope to use the cells or their derivatives in clinical settings. After all, there are legitimate concerns regarding the privacy of this information for those who provide cells. For example, data that might be disclosed include information about current illnesses, genetic predispositions to future diseases, and the like, which may pose social or economic risks to the individual. Accordingly, where possible, protections of privacy should be incorporated into the procurement process. Finally, selecting the sources for stem cell procurement may ultimately redound into questions of justice. For example, if stem cell lines are developed only among those of a certain ethnic background, and those lines are the ones banked and used to develop cell-based interventions, it is conceivable that the lines might only be suitable for use in those of a similar background. As a result, such therapies may not be available to those of other ethnic groups (Bok et al., 2004Bok H. Schill K.E. Faden R.R. Lancet. 2004; 364: 118-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Despite the relative ease of creating iPSCs compared to deriving stem cell lines from embryos, at this point it seems premature to conclude that it will be a simple matter to create autologous iPSCs for transplantation or regenerative medicine (assuming of course that at some point they are demonstrated to be safe and effective for doing so) in such a way that will resolve matters of justice. This is due in large part to the current inefficiencies in the process that translate into substantial cost, making personal iPSCs unaffordable to many who might stand to benefit from a future cellular intervention (Cyranoski, 2008Cyranoski D. Nature. 2008; 452: 406-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, depending on the proposed intervention, there may be a substantial time lag between the creation of a cell line and its availability for regenerative purposes. This limitation also adds to the likelihood that individualized iPSC therapies will be largely impractical for widespread clinical use. The in vivo use of stem cells or their derivatives, whether during experimentation with nonhuman animals or humans or by using untested interventions in an attempt to treat patients, can each raise ethical questions, regardless of the cell source. In addition to the ethical issues associated with research involving nonhuman animals in general, particular attention in stem cell research has focused on the creation of chimeras. Although chimeras don't seem to raise substantial ethical issues in some settings, for example in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the creation of nonhuman-human chimeras has animated popular concern. Of special relevance are studies involving the use of neural stem cells and the possibility of creating human-like characteristics in primates. Taken to an extreme is Michael Crichton's fictionalized account of chimeras in the novel Next. Despite the implausibility of Crichton's account, it presents a set of serious issues that are relevant to this sort of science. For example, will the engraftment of stem cells into the brains of nonhuman primates alter the mental capacity of the recipient? As such, it is essential that these sorts of experiments receive close scrutiny (Greene et al., 2005Greene M. Schill K. Takahashi S. Bateman-House A. Beauchamp T. Bok H. Cheney D. Coyle J. Deacon T. Dennett D. Donovan P. et al.Science. 2005; 309: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). First-in-human experiments with cell-based interventions also raise important ethical questions. These include obligations to have adequate preclinical evidence regarding the safety of proposed interventions, that there be reasonable plausibility about benefit, that the scientific design of the first human trials be sound, and that there be robust attention to obtaining meaningful informed consent (Sugarman, 1999Sugarman J. Science. 1999; 285: 2071-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is arguably only acceptable to move to a first-in-human trial with a cell-based intervention if there is scientific agreement about safety. Determining safety may be particularly complex for stem cell research (Scott, 2008Scott C.T. Neurosurg. Focus. 2008; 24: 1-4Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, early findings regarding iPSCs, although exciting, still face a set of obstacles that must be overcome prior to their possible use in treating human disease. In particular, based upon how they are currently generated, there are concerns about the use of viruses to transmit the reprogramming factors, their undetermined developmental potential after transplantation, and the possibility of tumor formation (Cyranoski, 2008Cyranoski D. Nature. 2008; 452: 406-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Holden and Vogel, 2008Holden C. Vogel G. Science. 2008; 319: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Hyun, 2008Hyun I. Stem cells from skin cells.Hastings Cent. Rep. 2008; 38: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, Kuehn, 2008Kuehn B.M. JAMA. 2008; 299: 26PubMed Google Scholar). To the extent possible, these sorts of issues need to be resolved in preclinical testing before assessing them again during first-in-human trials. Once such scientific questions about safety have been addressed, focus must shift toward assessing the likelihood that patients will benefit at some point in the future, even before first-in-human trials are conducted to assess the safety of this approach. That is, future benefit should be plausible based on such factors as determining the mechanisms of disease and the characteristics of the proposed cell-based intervention. This is especially important when the intervention will pose certain harms with unknown benefits, for instance when ablative regimens are used to prevent the rejection of a cell-based intervention. If there is ample suggestion for the possibility of benefit, at least to the level of “clinical equipoise,” meaning that a community of relevant experts is at least divided about the potential for improvement, the next step is the careful design of a particular trial. Essential points for consideration include such issues as dose, route of administration, whether ablative regimens will be employed, choice of monitoring procedures, and the selection of appropriate outcome measures. In addition to these issues, the selection of particular subjects to participate in first-in-human trials also raises important ethical questions. For example, how should the extent of illness affect the appropriateness of participation? Although those who are sickest may have the least to lose, the scientific usefulness of the results of first-in-human trials might be compromised if such patients have a range of comorbidities that confound the results. Alternatively, if healthier patients participate, and the cell-based intervention proves to be harmful, the subjects may have shortened their lives or incurred additional morbidity as a result of participating. Further, given the hype that can be associated with exciting emerging technologies, especially if they provide hope for treating an otherwise untreatable condition, it can be particularly difficult to obtain consent. In short, the combination of hype and desperation may make it difficult to convey that first-in-human trials are conducted primarily to assess safety, not efficacy. As efforts are taken to translate research findings into clinical practice, it seems prudent to use appropriate terms to describe the state of the field when seeking funding, describing results, and obtaining consent. For instance, at this point a term such as “cell--based intervention” rather than “cell-based therapy” would be more precise because we lack information to substantiate a claim that these interventions will indeed be therapeutic. Similar issues were encountered in describing “gene-transfer research” as “gene therapy” (King, 1999King N.M.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Complicating the usual process of carefully staged clinical trials has been the availability of so-called “stem cell therapies” in different parts of the world, prior to rigorous demonstrations of safety and efficacy (see report by C. Bodeen and A. Zagier). Such programs are rarely only local and may also attract “stem cell tourists” who travel across international borders to receive these untested interventions. Whether iPSCs will be associated with an upswing in these practices due to their relative ease of derivation in comparison to stem cells from embryos (but far more complicated than using cord blood or bone marrow) is unclear. However, transplantation of iPSCs may be especially treacherous, given their propensity to give rise to tumors in animal models. Regardless, the use of cell-based interventions of any type may violate clinicians' fiduciary responsibilities to patients because of the distinct possibility of harming patients as a result of using untested and unproven approaches. Moreover, such approaches may also deprive the scientific and medical communities of any data, whether positive or negative, that might enhance current understanding about these interventions. As the history of medicine makes clear, adopting untested interventions without studying them systematically can be fraught with peril and should be avoided. It would be a mistake to suggest that the ethical issues related to intellectual property and conflicts of interest are unique to stem cell research. Nevertheless, because these conflicts can have profound effects at every stage of the research enterprise and the intellectual, financial, and moral stakes in stem cell research are so high, they warrant mention. A central tension in acknowledging legitimate intellectual property rights is the potential effect such acknowledgments can have on advancing research in general. Obviously, this involves a balance of reward for effort and the desire to enhance scientific understanding regarding stem cell biology. Such questions about intellectual property may also arise in international collaboration as well as when working with commercial entities. The ISSCR urges negotiation among collaborating parties regarding these issues so as to conform to local policies while striving for maximal availability of materials to noncommercial entities in the hopes of advancing science and public benefit (see ISSCR guidelines).Whether such recommendations are achievable in all settings remains unclear, yet explicitly discussing such issues seems to be an important first step. Continuing legal debates about patented stem cell lines also deserve close attention (Holden, 2008Holden C. Science. 2008; 319: 1602-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, Scott, 2008Scott C.T. Neurosurg. Focus. 2008; 24: 1-4Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Of note, at a more fundamental level, there is a related debate focusing on the moral acceptability of patenting human tissue, which is reflected in different approaches to patenting across the globe (Plomer et al., 2008Plomer A. Taymor K.S. Scott C.T. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both nonfinancial and financial conflicts of interest may adversely affect good judgment regarding stem cell research. Although this issue is also not unique to stem cell science, substantial concerns have been raised about what could be considered nonfinancial conflicts of interests in stem cell research as scientists rush to publish their findings, sometimes resulting in error. Indeed, recently an editorial in a high-impact journal went so far as to suggest that, “Competition is good. . .Nonetheless, the fast-moving fields of science are showing some unpleasant tendencies. Researchers are cutting corners and making mistakes. They are making over-hyped promises that will probably be broken.” (Editorial, 2008EditorialNature. 2008; 452: 388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) Although at times difficult to assess and manage, it is essential that those engaged in stem cell research be alert to the possibilities of such nonfinancial conflicts in order to maximize the possibility of good science and good medicine. In contrast, financial conflicts of interest in research may be easier to identify, simply because financial interests can be measured and more easily described than those associated with nonfinancial interests, such as the advancement of scientific and professional concerns. Although having financial interest in research is understandable, financial conflicts of interest have the potential to threaten the integrity of a research effort, and the welfare of research participants, and so raise serious concerns that must be managed. Considerable attention has been directed at these issues in the research enterprise more broadly. Elevated awareness in this area was instigated in part by the death of Jesse Gelsinger during a gene transfer experiment. The principal investigator and the University of Pennsylvania, where the research was conducted, were alleged to have financial interests dependent on the study outcome (see reports from the American Association of Medical Colleges, the American Association of Universities, and the United States General Accounting Office). Current guidelines for stem cell research touch only briefly on issues of conflict of interest (Committee on Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Research, National Research Council, 2005Committee on Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Research, National Research CouncilGuidelines for human embryonic stem cell research. National Academies Press, Washington, DC2005Google Scholar; see also ISSCR guidelines) and thus should be expanded to accommodate these important concerns. As should be clear, stem cell research and treatment are immersed in ethical issues that go far beyond questions that are related to the destruction of the embryo. Nevertheless, it is essential that individuals involved in stem cell research and treatment be alert to these less polarizing issues so that this incredibly exciting path of research can be pursued in an ethically appropriate fashion. Guidelines issued by the National Academies of Science and the ISSCR address many of the important ethical issues in stem cell research (Committee on Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Research, National Research Council, 2005Committee on Guidelines for Embryonic Stem Cell Research, National Research CouncilGuidelines for human embryonic stem cell research. National Academies Press, Washington, DC2005Google Scholar, Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research Advisory Committee, National Research Council, 2007Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research Advisory Committee, National Research Council2007 Amendments to the National Academies' Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research. National Academies Press, Washington, DC2007Google Scholar; see also ISSCR guidelines). Experience using such approaches is now being garnered, and the particular approaches taken are rightly expected to change in step with scientific progress (Zettler et al., 2007Zettler P. Wolf L.E. Lo B. Acad. Med. 2007; 82: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although guidelines and oversight mechanisms should not be expected to resolve the full range of ethical issues associated with stem cell research, they provide a useful starting point and a process for sorting through the challenges at hand. As such, it is incumbent on those engaged in stem cell research to become familiar with the available guidelines and to help to improve them as needed to remain in step with scientific advances in the field. Overall, it is imperative that guidelines written to optimize the ethical design and conduct of stem cell research are sensitive to the realities of the enterprise and to its inherent moral concerns.

https://openalex.org/W1974132764,"The prevailing model of the mechanical function of intermediate filaments in cells assumes that these 10 nm diameter filaments make up networks that behave as entropic gels, with individual intermediate filaments never experiencing direct loading in tension. However, recent work has shown that single intermediate filaments and bundles are remarkably extensible and elastic in vitro, and therefore well-suited to bearing tensional loads. Here we tested the hypothesis that the intermediate filament network in keratinocytes is extensible and elastic as predicted by the available in vitro data. To do this, we monitored the morphology of fluorescently-tagged intermediate filament networks in cultured human keratinocytes as they were subjected to uniaxial cell strains as high as 133%. We found that keratinocytes not only survived these high strains, but their intermediate filament networks sustained only minor damage at cell strains as high as 100%. Electron microscopy of stretched cells suggests that intermediate filaments are straightened at high cell strains, and therefore likely to be loaded in tension. Furthermore, the buckling behavior of intermediate filament bundles in cells after stretching is consistent with the emerging view that intermediate filaments are far less stiff than the two other major cytoskeletal components F-actin and microtubules. These insights into the mechanical behavior of keratinocytes and the cytokeratin network provide important baseline information for current attempts to understand the biophysical basis of genetic diseases caused by mutations in intermediate filament genes."
https://openalex.org/W2044578782,"Wide-scale use of antiviral agents in the event of an influenza pandemic is likely to promote the emergence of drug resistance, with potentially deleterious effects for outbreak control. We explored factors promoting resistance within a dynamic infection model, and considered ways in which one or two drugs might be distributed to delay the spread of resistant strains or mitigate their impact.We have previously developed a novel deterministic model of influenza transmission that simulates treatment and targeted contact prophylaxis, using a limited stockpile of antiviral agents. This model was extended to incorporate subclinical infections, and the emergence of resistant virus strains under the selective pressure imposed by various uses of one or two antiviral agents. For a fixed clinical attack rate, R(0) rises with the proportion of subclinical infections thus reducing the number of infections amenable to treatment or prophylaxis. In consequence, outbreak control is more difficult, but emergence of drug resistance is relatively uncommon. Where an epidemic may be constrained by use of a single antiviral agent, strategies that combine treatment and prophylaxis are most effective at controlling transmission, at the cost of facilitating the spread of resistant viruses. If two drugs are available, using one drug for treatment and the other for prophylaxis is more effective at preventing propagation of mutant strains than either random allocation or drug cycling strategies. Our model is relatively straightforward, and of necessity makes a number of simplifying assumptions. Our results are, however, consistent with the wider body of work in this area and are able to place related research in context while extending the analysis of resistance emergence and optimal drug use within the constraints of a finite drug stockpile.Combined treatment and prophylaxis represents optimal use of antiviral agents to control transmission, at the cost of drug resistance. Where two drugs are available, allocating different drugs to cases and contacts is likely to be most effective at constraining resistance emergence in a pandemic scenario."

Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moco biosynthesis is an evolutionarily conserved pathway comprising several reactions starting from GTP via several intermediates to the formation of the molybdopterin (MPT) moiety, a tricyclic pyranopterin with a unique dithiolene group that provides the platform for the coordination of the molybdenum atom thus forming Mo-MPT (2Hänzelmann P.

Genetic deficiencies of enzymes involved in Moco biosynthesis give rise to the pleiotropic loss of molybdoenzymes. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes consequences are dramatic because molybdenum enzymes are essential for diverse metabolic processes. In humans, Moco deficiency leads to premature death of affected newborns, and in bacteria, Moco deficiency leads to dramatically reduced metabolic adaptability and diversity (11Leimkühler S.

Two specific proteins involved in the maturation of Moco-containing enzymes were shown to bind the Moco and to transfer it to the apoprotein. Indeed in Rhodobacter capsulatus, the XdhC protein coordinates Mo-MPT binding, modification to the sulfurated Mo-MPT form, and insertion into the xanthine dehydrogenase enzyme (16Neumann M.

Moreover the Moco carrier protein of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii also identified in other eukaryotes was shown to bind Mo-MPT but not MPT and in vitro can transfer Moco to aponitrate reductase or aposulfite oxidase (17Hänzelmann P. Schindelin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6829-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Molybdoenzyme TorA and its dedicated chaperone TorD from Escherichia coli represent the archetypal model couple; TorD function is the most studied and best understood in the field (14Ilbert M.

TorA is a bis-MGD-containing reductase involved in periplasmic bacterial trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) respiration, and TorD is the dedicated chaperone allowing optimal production of active TorA in the cell (13Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Genest O. Seduk F. Théraulaz L. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 265: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). So far, two roles have been experimentally attributed to TorD. First, TorD binds and protects the N-terminal twin arginine signal peptide of apoTorA (19Genest O. Seduk F. Ilbert M. Mejean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Hatzixanthis K. Clarke T.A. Oubrie A. Richardson D.J. Turner R.J. Sargent F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8460-8465Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); second, TorD binds the core of apoTorA and enhances the bis-MGD insertion by forming the apoprotein in a competent shape (13Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Ilbert M. Méjean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It was also proposed that TorD proofreads in a GTP-dependent way the TorA preprotein for cofactor insertion and targets it to the specific twin arginine translocation system (21Jack R.L. Buchanan G. Dubini A. Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3962-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 22Hatzixanthis K. Clarke T.A. Oubrie A. Richardson D.J. Turner R.J. Sargent F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8460-8465Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, these aspects have not been definitively demonstrated, and they could be side effects of TorD binding and protection of TorA signal peptide. E. coli TorD protein is part of a large family of metalloprotein-associated chaperones presenting a low homology level in their primary amino acid sequences but sharing an all α-helical structure organized in two domains connected by a short hinge region (23Ilbert M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Tranier S. Mortier-Barrière I. Ilbert M. Birck C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Méjean V. Samama J.P.

Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis showed that this interdomain region with two conserved residues was critical for the signal sequence recognition and the proofreading activity of TorD (21Jack R.L. Buchanan G. Dubini A. Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3962-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Nevertheless the affinity of the two TorD variants for the TorA signal peptide was not dramatically modified (22Hatzixanthis K. Clarke T.A. Oubrie A. Richardson D.J. Turner R.J. Sargent F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8460-8465Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here we chose a strategy of random mutagenesis of the torD gene to find the region involved in TorD-TorA interactions. A poorly conserved patch in TorD protein was shown to interact with the core of apoTorA but not with the signal peptide. By using several in vitro and in vivo approaches, we revealed that the maturation of the TorA apoprotein is tightly dependent on this interaction. Finally it appears that TorD has a third function. It is a Moco-binding protein also capable of specific interaction with MobA, the enzyme involved in MGD biosynthesis. TorD thus allows cofactor insertion by connecting all the components necessary for TorA maturation. Our work thus reveals a new role for members of the TorD family. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The E. coli strains used in this work are MC4100 (araD139 Δ(lacI-POZYA-argF) U169 rpsL thi), LCB515 (MC4100 torD::Ω Spcr ΔdmsD Kmr), LCB440 (MC4100 Δ(torSTRCAD) Δ(dmsABC) Kmr) (18Genest O. Ilbert M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol.

Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), and BL21(DE3) (F- ompT hsdSB (rB- mB-) dcm gal (DE3)) (Novagen). The strains were grown in Luria broth medium, and when necessary, ampicillin (50 μg·ml-1) was added to maintain plasmid selection. Plasmids pBD, pBDC79R, and pBDL83P are pBad24 derivatives allowing the synthesis of His6-tagged TorD, His6-tagged TorDC79R, and His6-tagged TorDL83P, respectively (Ref. 18Genest O. Ilbert M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15644-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and this work). Plasmid pBDW40H allows the synthesis of His6-tagged TorDW40H. The site-directed mutagenesis used to construct the torDW40H allele was the overlap extension method of Ho et al. (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) based on two rounds of PCR amplification with two divergent complementary primers, each bearing the expected mutation, and with two convergent primers. The torD allele was introduced in pBad24 as described previously (18Genest O. Ilbert M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15644-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTorA allowing His6-tagged apoTorA production was described previously (14Ilbert M. Méjean V.

To construct plasmid pMobA, which allows the synthesis of His6-tagged MobA, the same cloning strategy as that described previously (14Ilbert M. Méjean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used except that the mobA coding sequence was cloned into the BamHI-HindIII cloning sites of pet21(+) (Novagen). Plasmid pMN56 allowing R. capsulatus MobA production was described previously (28Neumann M. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28493-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Transformations were carried out according to the method of Chung and Miller (29Chung C.T. Miller R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Isolation of Random torD Mutants—For random mutagenesis, the torD coding sequence was amplified from MC4100 chromosomal DNA by PCR using the same primers used for the construction of pTorD. To allow the introduction of mutations in the torD sequence, three successive rounds of PCR amplification (30 cycles each) were performed. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the PCR products were cloned into the corresponding EcoRI and HindIII sites of pBad24 vector. Ligation products were then transformed in strain LCB515, and the resulting colonies were screened on MacConkey plates supplemented with 0.15% maltose and 0.4% TMAO at 43 °C. Strains producing wild type TorD proteins yielded white colonies, whereas strains producing TorD-negative mutant proteins yielded red colonies. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—ApoTorA protein was purified as described previously (14Ilbert M. Méjean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In these production conditions, the first 35 amino acids of the N-terminal extremity of apoTorA are missing (19Genest O. Seduk F. Ilbert M. Mejean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recombinant TorD and TorD variants were purified from the soluble extract of strain LCB515 containing either pBD, pBDC79R, pBDL83P, or pBDW40H grown aerobically at 37 °C in the presence of arabinose (0.2%). Recombinant MobA protein was purified from the soluble extract of strain BL21(DE3)/pMobA grown aerobically at 37 °C in the presence of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm). Protein purifications were performed by HisTrap chelating HP chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (14Ilbert M. Méjean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After purification, apoTorA and the various forms of TorD were dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. Preparation of Extracts—For the soluble fraction analyses, strains were grown anaerobically overnight with 0.2% TMAO at 37 and 43 °C. The cells were resuspended in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, washed twice, and disrupted by a French press. The extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm, and the recovered supernatants were centrifuged at 45,000 rpm to obtain the soluble fractions. Analytical Procedures—TMAO reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 37 °C by following the oxidation of reduced benzyl viologen at 600 nm coupled to the reduction of TMAO (13Pommier J. Méjean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TMAO reductase activity units correspond to μmol of TMAO reduced/min/mg of proteins. Proteins were revealed after SDS-PAGE either by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting using TorA antibodies. In Vitro Activation of apoTorA—The cofactor source (SN440) corresponds to the soluble fraction (40 mg·ml-1, in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7) of strain LCB440 grown anaerobically at 37 °C as described previously (14Ilbert M. Méjean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). ApoTorA (0.5 μm) was mixed with 100 μl of SN440 in the presence of either TorD or TorD variants (2.3 μm). The mixture was incubated for 120 min at 37 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. Units correspond to μmol of TMAO reduced/min/mg of apoTorA. Circular Dichroism Spectra—Far-UV circular dichroism spectra of purified proteins (3.6 μm) were monitored from 195 to 260 nm. The spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 instrument equipped with a Peltier-type temperature control system (model PTC-348WI) with a 2-mm path length and a scan rate of 20 nm·min-1 at 20 °C. Base lines were corrected by subtracting the buffer spectrum. Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—Binding experiments were performed with the surface plasmon resonance-based instrument Biacore™ 2000 and sensor chips (CM5) using the control software 2.1 and evaluation software 3.0 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). TorD was immobilized via amine coupling with 300, 1000, and 2100 resonance units/flow cell. As a control bovine serum albumin was immobilized via amine coupling with 900 resonance units. The running buffer was 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20. MobA with concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 μm was injected at 25 °C for 5 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min followed by a 20-min dissociation using kinject and regeneration of the sensor surface with 10–20 mm HCl for 1 min. Binding curves were normalized by subtraction of buffer injection curves for all flow cells and MobA curves for the control flow cell. Chemical Cross-linking Studies—Interactions of TorD and TorD variants (23 μm) with truncated apoTorA (1.6 μm) or interactions of TorD and TorD variants (40 μm) with MobA (40 μm) were tested using 5 mm bismaleimidohexane or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, respectively, as cross-linkers. Proteins and cross-linkers were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The interactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and were revealed either by Western blotting using TorA antibodies or Coomassie Blue staining. Two-hybrid Assays—PCR product of truncated torA gene (from nucleotide 109 to the end of the gene) coding for a TorA protein devoid of its signal peptide and PCR products of torD and torD derivatives were fused to the two catalytic domains, T18 and T25, of adenylate cyclase using plasmids pEB355 and pEB354, respectively (26Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 30Battesti A. Bouveret E. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1048-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). After co-transformation of BTH101 strain (cya) with the two plasmids expressing the fusions, plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. The strain was then grown in LB medium supplemented with 125 μg·ml-1 ampicillin, 40 μg·ml-1 kanamycin, and 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C overnight. The efficiency of complementation was quantified by measuring β-galactosidase activity by the method of Miller (31Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 72-74Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed at 20 °C using a Micro-Cal MCS instrument. TorD and TorD variants were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.2. The protein concentration was 10 μm in the calorimetric cell. Each experiment consisted of 10-μl injections of 100 μm peptide prepared in the same buffer (30 injections in total). For every injection, the binding enthalpy was calculated by integration of the peak area using the ORIGIN software. The association constant Ka and additional binding parameters (enthalpy and entropy) were obtained through curve fitting with ORIGIN; ΔG values were -7.6·103 and -7.5·103 kJ·mol-1 for TorD and TorDL83P, respectively. Peptide SPTorA10–50 was chemically synthesized by Genosphere Biotechnologies (Paris, France). Form A Detection—Mo-MPT was quantified by conversion to Form A as described earlier (16Neumann M. Schulte M. Jünemann N. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mo-MPT was extracted from TorD by the addition of 50 μl of acidic iodine. After incubation at room temperature for 14 h, excess iodine was removed by the addition of 55 μl of 1% ascorbic acid, and the sample was adjusted with 1 m Tris to pH 8.3. The phosphate monoester of Form A was cleaved by the addition of 40 mm MgCl2 and 1 unit of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. MGD was extracted from TorD and converted to Form A-GMP by overnight treatment with acidic iodine at room temperature as described previously (28Neumann M. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28493-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Form A-GMP was purified by chromatography on Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). 400 μl of Q-Sepharose was equilibrated with H2O, the oxidized samples were loaded, and Form A-GMP was eluted with 50 mm HCl and converted to Form A by the addition of MgCl2, nucleotide pyrophosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase at pH 8.0. After the addition of 10 μl of acetic acid, Form A from Mo-MPT and MGD was identified and quantified by HPLC analysis with a C18 reversed phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250-mm ODS Hypersil; particle size, 5 μm) with 5 mm ammonium acetate, 15% methanol at an isocratic flow rate of 1 ml/min. In-line fluorescence was monitored by an Agilent 1100 series detector with excitation at 383 nm and emission at 450 nm. The quantification of Form A was determined as described earlier (16Neumann M. Schulte M. Jünemann N. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Binding of Mo-MPT—4.6 μm TorD (in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2) was incubated with free Mo-MPT (0–16 μm) for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were transferred to Microcon concentrators (molecular weight cutoff, 10,000; Millipore) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. As a control, free Mo-MPT was used in the absence of TorD. The flow-through containing unbound Mo-MPT was converted to Form A and quantified. Fitting was based on the law of mass action for a Mo-MPT to TorD ratio of n × m (16Neumann M. Schulte M. Jünemann N. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin, TorT (33Baraquet C. Théraulaz L. Guiral M. Lafitte D. Méjean V. Jourlin-Castelli C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38189-38199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), TorD, and TorD variants (4.6 μm each) in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, were mixed with free Moco (10 μm) for 15 min. To remove unbound Mo-MPT, samples were loaded on Nick columns (gel filtration) (GE Healthcare), and fractions containing protein with bound Moco were collected. Mo-MPT was converted to Form A, quantified, and expressed as a percentage of Mo-MPT bound to TorD. Binding of MGD—MobA was expressed from plasmid pMN56 and purified as described earlier (28Neumann M. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28493-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The His tag was removed by usage of the Thrombin CleanCleave kit (Sigma). For MGD synthesis, either 2.5 or 25 μm MobA and 25 μm TorD were incubated in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and 50 μm Mo-MPT in a total volume of 400 μl. The mixtures were loaded onto a 200-μl nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. The column was washed with 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and TorD was eluted in 400 μl of buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Samples were analyzed for MGD content as described above. Screening Method to Isolate Inactive TorD Mutants—TMAO reductase activity is mainly due to the activity of TorA, the periplasmic reductase of the Tor system (34Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). At 43 °C, it was shown previously that TorD is essential for TorA stability (18Genest O. Ilbert M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15644-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus TorD- strain (LCB515) cannot use TMAO as a substrate when grown at 43 °C unless it bears a plasmid carrying and expressing torD gene (18Genest O. Ilbert M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15644-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To discriminate TorD+ and TorD- strains, cells were plated on MacConkey/maltose medium containing TMAO and incubated overnight at 43 °C. Hence cells from strain LCB515 unable to use TMAO as exogenous substrate grew as dark red colonies, whereas cells from the recombinant strain carrying pTorD plasmid were white due to the alkalinization of the medium by the production of trimethylamine (35Bordi C. Théraulaz L. Méjean V. Jourlin-Castelli C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Generation of Random torD Mutations—Random mutagenesis of the torD gene was performed. 20,000 colonies of recombinant strains carrying potential TorD mutants were screened. Among 1380 red candidates, 516 contained the torD gene in the plasmid as shown by appropriate PCR. The presence of the full-length TorD polypeptide was determined by Western blotting using TorD antiserum. A total of 65 clones were found to produce the complete TorD protein in appropriate amounts. Among them, only eight proteins proved stable; these were found in the soluble fraction of the recombinant strain. The eight torD alleles were sequenced, showing that all the mutations were transitions. Substitution L83P was found seven times in mutants carrying single or multiple mutations, and substitution C79R was found once. By directed mutagenesis we showed that the phenotype of double mutants came from the L83P mutation. Finally two TorD mutants, TorDL83P and TorDC79R, were selected for detailed analysis. The purified TorD mutants loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels have a single band profile with no degradation, confirming the stability of the two mutated proteins (Fig. 1A). Moreover circular dichroism confirmed that they were correctly fol"
https://openalex.org/W1973143535,"The honeybee waggle dance, through which foragers advertise the existence and location of a food source to their hive mates, is acknowledged as the only known form of symbolic communication in an invertebrate. However, the suggestion, that different species of honeybee might possess distinct ‘dialects’ of the waggle dance, remains controversial. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether different species of honeybee can learn from and communicate with each other. This study reports experiments using a mixed-species colony that is composed of the Asiatic bee Apis cerana cerana (Acc), and the European bee Apis mellifera ligustica (Aml). Using video recordings made at an observation hive, we first confirm that Acc and Aml have significantly different dance dialects, even when made to forage in identical environments. When reared in the same colony, these two species are able to communicate with each other: Acc foragers could decode the dances of Aml to successfully locate an indicated food source. We believe that this is the first report of successful symbolic communication between two honeybee species; our study hints at the possibility of social learning between the two honeybee species, and at the existence of a learning component in the honeybee dance language."
https://openalex.org/W1999773016,"Pancreatic-duodenal homeobox factor-1 (Pdx1) is highly enriched in islet beta cells and integral to proper cell development and adult function. Of the four conserved 5'-flanking sequence blocks that contribute to transcription in vivo, Area II (mouse base pairs -2153/-1923) represents the only mammalian specific control domain. Here we demonstrate that regulation of beta-cell-enriched Pdx1 expression by the MafA and MafB transcription factors is exclusively through Area II. Thus, these factors were found to specifically activate through Area II in cell line transfection-based assays, and MafA, which is uniquely expressed in adult islet beta cells was only bound to this region in quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation studies. MafA and MafB are produced in beta cells during development and were both bound to Area II at embryonic day 18.5. Expression of a transgene driven by Pdx1 Areas I and II was also severely compromised during insulin+ cell formation in MafB(-/-) mice, consistent with the importance of this large Maf in beta-cell production and Pdx1 expression. These findings illustrate the significance of large Maf proteins to Pdx1 expression in beta cells, and in particular MafB during pancreatic development."

Here we report the isolation of μ-conotoxins SIIIA and SIIIB by 125I-TIIIA-guided fractionation of milked Conus striatus venom. SIIIA and SIIIB potently displaced 125I-TIIIA from native rat brain Nav1.2 (IC50 values 10 and 5 nm, respectively) and muscle Nav1.4 (IC50 values 60 and 3 nm, respectively) VGSCs, and both inhibited current through Xenopus oocyte-expressed Nav1.2 and Nav1.4. An alanine scan of SIIIA-(2–20), a pyroglutamate-truncated analogue with enhanced neuronal activity, revealed residues important for affinity and selectivity. Alanine replacement of the solvent-exposed Trp-12, Arg-14, His-16, Arg-18 resulted in large reductions in SIIIA-(2–20) affinity, with His-16 replacement affecting structure. In contrast, [D15A]SIIIA-(2–20) had significantly enhanced neuronal affinity (IC50 0.65 nm), while the double mutant [D15A/H16R]SIIIA-(2–20) showed greatest Nav1.2 versus 1.4 selectivity (136-fold). 1H NMR studies revealed that SIIIA adopted a single conformation in solution comprising a series of turns and anα-helical motif across residues 11–16 that is not found in larger μ-conotoxins.

To learn more about the different roles played by each of the VGSC subtypes in normal and disease states requires new inhibitors with improved VGSC subtype selectivity. Inhibitors of TTX-S VGSCs include tetrodotoxin (TTX) from puffer fish, the saxitoxins (STXs) from marine dinoflagellates, and the μ-conotoxins from the venom of cone snails. These toxins act competitively at Site 1 in the P-loop region of the ion-conducting pore of the α-subunit of the VGSC (3Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. Waxman S.G. Pharmacol.

To define aspects of their structure that contribute to binding to mammalian VGSCs, we determined the NMR structure of SIIIA. Distinct from other μ-conotoxins, SIIIA adopts a single conformation in solution that includes an α-helical motif not previously seen in other members of this class. This structural change was associated with a significant pharmacophore shift from the dominant arginine residue in loop 2 of the larger μ-conotoxins to a series of five similarly important residues, including four associated with the α-helical region, in the smaller SIIIA. Interestingly, a number of SIIIA analogues had significantly enhanced neuronal selectivity, opening the way to the development of subtype-selective neuronal VGSC inhibitors. Isolation of μ-Conotoxins SIIIA and SIIIB—Crude C. striatus milked venom was separated into 80 1-min fractions by semipreparative RP-HPLC using a Vydac C18 column (250 × 10 mm, 5 μ) eluted at 3 ml/min with a 1% gradient from 100% A to 80% B over 80 min (solvent A 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, solvent B 90% ACN + 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid).

The sequences of SIIIA and SIIIB (Table 1) were determined by Edman sequencing only after pyroglutamate aminopeptidase digestion, indicating that the N-terminal residue of both these conotoxins was a pyroglutamate. The observed masses for native SIIIA and SIIIB (2206.8 and 2120.7 Da, respectively) were consistent with the Edman sequencing results for peptides with an amidated C terminus.

Boc-l-amino acids were purchased from Bachem and Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other reagents and solvents were ACS analytical reagent grade. Radioligand Binding Studies—125I-TIIIA (prepared using IODOGEN) radioligand binding studies were performed using rat brain and rat skeletal muscle preparations to measure Nav1.2 and Nav1.4 affinity, as previously described (15Lewis R.J.

Nonlinear regressions (Hillslope-1) were fitted to triplicate data obtained for each experiment using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Recording of Depolarization-activated Sodium Ion Currents in Rat DRG Neurons—Neonatal rat DRG neurons were prepared as described previously (31Daly N.L. Ekberg J.A. Thomas L. Adams D.J. Lewis R.J. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25774-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Whole cell TTX-S and TTX-R sodium ion currents were recorded in using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices Corp.). Series resistance was routinely compensated by 70–80%. Capacitive and leakage currents were digitally subtracted using a -P/6 pulse protocol. Internal pipette solution contained (in mm): NaCl 10, CsF 130, CsCl 10, EGTA 10, HEPES-CsOH 10, pH 7.2, 290–300 mOsm (with sucrose). The bath solution contained (in mm): NaCl 50, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1, glucose 10, tetraethylammonium (TEA)-Cl 90, HEPES-TEA-OH 10, pH 7.35. TTX-resistant sodium ion currents were recorded from small DRG neurons (≤25 μm diameter) in the presence of 300 nm TTX. Large neurons (≥40 μm diameter), in which the sodium ion current exhibited fast activation and inactivation kinetics and was mostly TTX-sensitive (>90%), were used to study toxin effects on TTX-S sodium ion current after complete washout of TTX block. Toxins were diluted in extracellular solution and added via a gravity-fed perfusion system. Xenopus Oocyte Experiments—Depolarization-activated sodium ion currents were recorded from Xenopus oocytes expressing various VGSC α-subunit subtypes using a two-electrode (virtual ground circuit) voltage clamp at room temperature (20–23 °C) with a GeneClamp 500B amplifier and pCLAMP 8 software (Axon Instruments Inc, Union City, CA). Bath solution contained (in mm) 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.3 CaCl2, and 20 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5. Data were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and leak-subtracted on-line using a -P/6 protocol and analyzed off-line. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 8 software (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA). Rat Nav1.2 and rat Nav1.3 was a gift from A. Goldin (University of California), human Nav1.5 a gift from R. Kass (Columbia University), and human Nav1.7 a gift from N. Klugbauer (Teknischen Universität, Munich). Toxins were added by direct bath application (static bath) followed by extensive mixing to reach the final concentrations stated. The steady-state block was reached after ∼8 min of toxin exposure, and washout of SIIIA was followed for 20–30 min. 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker ARX 500 spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient unit, a Bruker DMX 750, or a Bruker 600 Avance spectrometer equipped with a x,y,z-gradient unit. Peptide concentrations were ∼2 mm. SIIIA and SIIIB were examined in 95% H2O/5% D2O (pH 3.0, 275–298 K) and in 100% D2O (260–293 K). SIIIA analogues were examined in 90% H2O/10% D2O, pH 3.0. For SIIIA, 1H NMR experiments recorded included NOESY, (mixing times 120, 300, and 400 ms), TOCSY (mixing time 80 ms), double-quantum filtered (DQF)-COSY, and E-COSY in 100% D2O. Slowly exchanging amide protons were detected by acquiring one-dimensional NMR spectra immediately after dissolving the peptide in 100% D2O at pH 3.5. For all other analogues, TOCSY experiments with a mixing time of 80 ms were acquired. Additional NOESY experiments were only run if ambiguities arose during assignment. All spectra were run over 6024 Hz (500 MHz), 7184 Hz (600 MHz), or 8192 Hz (750 MHz) with 4K data points, 400–512 FIDs, 8–64 scans, and a recycle delay of 1–2 s. The solvent was suppressed using the WATERGATE sequence (32Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3522) Google Scholar). Spectra were processed using UXNMR as described previously (29Nielsen K.J. Adams D. Thomas L. Bond T. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and using Aurelia, subtraction of background was used to minimize T1-noise. Chemical shift values of SIIIA and analogues were obtained in 90% H2O, 10% D2O and referenced internally to DSS at 0.00 ppm. Secondary Hα shifts were measured and compared with values for random coil shifts (33Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). SIIIA was assigned in sparky (34Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2004Google Scholar), and distance information obtained by integration of a 300 ms mixing time NOESY spectrum. Backbone dihedral restraints were derived from 3JHN-Hαcoupling constants from a DQF-COSY spectrum or a one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum. The ϕ dihedral angle restraints included were restrained to 120 ± 30° for 3JHN-Hα >8 Hz and -60 ± 30° for 3JHN-Hα <5.8 Hz. χ1 dihedral angels were determined from intraresidue nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) and 3JHα-Hβ coupling patterns for an E-COSY spectrum. Initial structures were generated using dyana (35Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

An initial 50 structures were calculated, and the 17 lowest overall energy structures selected to represent the solution structure of SIIIA. Isolation of μ-Conotoxins SIIIA and SIIIB—To identify μ-conotoxins selective for neuronal VGSCs, fractionated milked C. striatus venom was assayed for the ability to displace 125I-TIIIA from rat brain sodium channels (15Lewis R.J.

Three active fractions with retention times of 20, 21, and 24 min (Fig. 1) were purified to homogeneity, digested using pyroglutaminase, and Edman-sequenced to reveal three peptides with a CC-C-C-CC motif characteristic of μ-conotoxins (38Cruz L.J.

Fraction 24 contained the sequence of TIIIA, previously identified in C. tulipa by PCR (15Lewis R.J. Schroeder C.I. Ekberg J. Nielsen K.J. Loughnan M. Thomas L. Adams D.A. Drinkwater R. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 676-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), fraction 20 the sequence for SIIIA, while fraction 21 contained a sequence for a new μ-conotoxin we named SIIIB (Table 1). SIIIA and SIIIB each comprised 20 residues with a net charge of +2 and +3, respectively. Mass spectrometry and co-elution studies of the native and synthetic peptides confirmed the sequences and C-terminal amidation of both peptides (data not shown). Radioligand Binding Studies—Synthetic μ-conotoxin SIIIA and SIIIB each potently displaced 125I-TIIIA from VGSCs in rat brain and rat skeletal muscle (Fig. 2). The pIC50values for SIIIA and SIIIB and selected additional μ-conotoxins are summarized in Table 2. Similar to TTX and STX, SIIIA had a small but significant preference for neuronal Nav1.2 over the skeletal muscle Nav1.4, whereas SIIIB had a preference for Nav1.4. Both SIIIA and SIIIB were full inhibitors of 125I-TIIIA binding to rat brain or skeletal muscle sodium channels. Interestingly, removing the pyro"
https://openalex.org/W2066987472,"Potent cell activation by endotoxin requires sequential protein-endotoxin and protein-protein interactions involving lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, CD14, MD-2, and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). MD-2 plays an essential role by bridging endotoxin (E) recognition initiated by lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and CD14 to TLR4 activation by presenting endotoxin as a monomeric E.MD-2 complex that directly and potently activates TLR4. Secreted MD-2 (sMD-2) exists as a mixture of monomers and multimers. Published data suggest that only MD-2 monomer can interact with endotoxin and TLR4 and support cell activation, but the apparent instability of MD-2 has thwarted efforts to more fully separate and characterize the individual species of sMD-2. We have taken advantage of the much greater stability of sMD-2 in insect culture medium to fully separate sMD-2 monomer from dimer by gel sieving chromatography. At low nanomolar concentrations, the sMD-2 monomer, but not dimer, reacted with a monomeric complex of E.sCD14 to form monomeric E.MD-2 and activate HEK293/TLR4 cells. The monomer, but not dimer, also reacted with the ectodomain of TLR4 with an affinity comparable with the picomolar affinity of E.MD-2. These findings demonstrate directly that the monomeric form of sMD-2 is the active species both for reaction with E.CD14 and TLR4, as needed for potent endotoxin-induced TLR4 activation."
https://openalex.org/W1971188778,"Death-associated protein kinase 2 (DAPK2) belongs to a family of proapoptotic Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated serine/threonine kinases. We recently identified DAPK2 as an enhancing factor during granulocytic differentiation. To identify transcriptional DAPK2 regulators, we cloned 2.7 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the DAPK2 gene. We found that E2F1 and Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) strongly activate the DAPK2 promoter. We mapped the E2F1 and KLF6 responsive elements to a GC-rich region 5′ of exon 1 containing several binding sites for KLF6 and Sp1 but not for E2F. Moreover, we showed that transcriptional activation of DAPK2 by E2F1 and KLF6 is dependent on Sp1 using Sp1/KLF6-deficient insect cells, mithramycin A treatment to block Sp1-binding or Sp1 knockdown cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed recruitment of Sp1 and to lesser extent that of E2F1 and KLF6 to the DAPK2 promoter. Activation of E2F1 in osteosarcoma cells led to an increase of endogenous DAPK2 paralleled by cell death. Inhibition of DAPK2 expression resulted in significantly reduced cell death upon E2F1 activation. Similarly, KLF6 expression in H1299 cells increased DAPK2 levels accompanied by cell death that is markedly decreased upon DAPK2 knockdown. Moreover, E2F1 and KLF6 show cooperation in activating the DAPK2 promoter. In summary, our findings establish DAPK2 as a novel Sp1-dependent target gene for E2F1 and KLF6 in cell death response."

Here, we report a significant increase in the length of proximal colonic crypts in Fabp-PG mice, associated with potent antiapoptotic effects of PG, which likely contributed to the previously reported increase in colon carcinogenesis in Fabp-PG mice. Phosphorylation of kinase of IκBα (IKKα/β), inhibitor of κB (IκB)α and p65NF-κB was significantly elevated in proximal colonic crypts of Fabp-PG versus wild-type mice, which was associated with degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation/activation of p65. Surprisingly, distal colonic crypt cells were not as responsive to elevated levels of PG in Fabp-PG mice. Annexin II, recently described as a high-affinity receptor for PG, strongly co-localized with PG intracellularly and on basolateral membranes of proximal crypt cells, providing evidence that annexin-II binds PG in situ in colonic crypt cells. Proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of PG on proximal crypts of Fabp-PG mice were attenuated to wild-type levels, on treatment with NEMO peptide (an inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation), demonstrating for the first time a critical role of NF-κB in mediating hyperproliferative affects of PG on colonic crypts of Fabp-PG mice, in vivo. Thus, downregulation of NF-κB may significantly reduce the increased risk of colon carcinogenesis in response to PG."

We previously used a tetracycline-inducible stable mammalian cell line, HEK293S-TetR, for regulated high-level expression of G-protein coupled receptors. We here report successfully using this method for high-level expression of de novo oligo-DNA assembled human CD81 gene. CD81 is a member of the vital tetraspanin membrane protein family. It has recently been identified as the putative receptor for the Hepatitis C Virus envelope E2 glycoprotein (HCV-E2). In this study we used a single-step rho-1D4-affinity purification method to obtain >95% purity from HEK293S-TetR-inducible stable cell lines. Using ELISA assay we determined that the affinity of the purified CD81 receptor for HCV-E2 protein is 3.8+/-1.2 nM. Using fluorescent confocal microscopy we showed that the inducibly overexpressed CD81 receptor in HEK293S-TetR cells is correctly located on the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that the combination of high-level expression of CD81 with efficient single-step immunoaffinity purification is a useful method for obtaining large quantities of CD81 membrane receptor suitable for detailed structural analyses of this elusive tetraspanin protein. Furthermore, this simple single-step immunoaffinity purification to high purity of membrane protein could be useful broadly for other membrane protein purifications, thus accelerating the determination of structures for large numbers of difficult-to-obtain membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2147860111,"G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase-2 interacting protein 1 (GIT1) is a multifunctional scaffolding protein that regulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways. We demonstrate that GIT1 interacts with sorting nexin 6 (SNX6), a member of the SNX family that increases EGFR trafficking between endosomes and lysosomes, thereby enhancing EGFR degradation. The GIT1-SNX6 interaction is increased 3-fold after treatment with EGF for 60 min. The second coiled-coil domain (CC2; aa 424-474) of GIT1 mediates binding to SNX6. Subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy data indicate that GIT1 and SNX6 interact in endosomes. Knockdown of GIT1 expression by small interfering RNA decreased the rate of EGF-induced EGFR degradation. Expression of exogenous GIT1 or SNX6 alone did not alter EGFR degradation; however, coexpression of GIT1 and SNX6 decreased EGFR levels both basally and in response to EGF. In contrast, expression of GIT1(CC2 deleted) and SNX6 did not reduce EGFR levels, demonstrating that the interaction between GIT1 and SNX6 was required to regulate EGFR trafficking. Phosphorylation of the EGFR substrate phospholipase C-gamma was decreased by coexpression of GIT1 and SNX6. These data demonstrate an endosomal, EGF-regulated interaction between SNX6 and GIT1 that enhances degradation of the EGFR, and thereby alters EGFR signaling. Our findings suggest a new role for GIT1 in tyrosine kinase receptor trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1967140860,"Background The study of ascidians (Chordata, Tunicata) has made a considerable contribution to our understanding of the origin and evolution of basal chordates. To provide further information to support forward genetics in Ciona intestinalis, we used a combination of natural variation and neutral population genetics as an approach for the systematic identification of new mutations. In addition to the significance of developmental variation for phenotype-driven studies, this approach can encompass important implications in evolutionary and population biology. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we report a preliminary survey for naturally occurring mutations in three geographically interconnected populations of C. intestinalis. The influence of historical, geographical and environmental factors on the distribution of abnormal phenotypes was assessed by means of 12 microsatellites. We identified 37 possible mutant loci with stereotyped defects in embryonic development that segregate in a way typical of recessive alleles. Local populations were found to differ in genetic organization and frequency distribution of phenotypic classes. Conclusions/Significance Natural genetic polymorphism of C. intestinalis constitutes a valuable source of phenotypes for studying embryonic development in ascidians. Correlating genetic structure and the occurrence of abnormal phenotypes is a crucial focus for understanding the selective forces that shape natural finite populations, and may provide insights of great importance into the evolutionary mechanisms that generate animal diversity."

Once chemistry has taken place, the loop dynamics determine the rate of product release. The importance of conformational changes in enzyme catalysis has long been appreciated. These changes are thought to fulfill a number of roles in catalysis: enhanced binding of substrate, correct orientation of catalytic groups, removal of water from the active site, and trapping of intermediates. Loop motion is classified as an enzyme conformational change, where flexible surface loops move to different conformations (1Gutteridge A. Thornton J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Flexible loops are also a common feature of the family of nucleoside hydrolases (EC 3.2.2.1) (2Versees W. Steyaert J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All structures of the nucleoside hydrolases determined until now show two flexible loops in the vicinity of the active sites, which undergo substantial conformational changes upon association of substrates and inhibitors (2Versees W.

It has been shown ciative SN2-type mechanism with an oxocarbenium ion-like transition state (3Horenstein B.A. Parkin D.W. Estupiñán B. Schramm V.L.

The purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase of Trypanosoma vivax (TvNH) has been very well characterized kinetically and structurally. This allowed us to put forward a detailed catalytic mechanism to accomplish these strategies. An aspartate (Asp10) in the ribose binding pocket acts as a general base to activate the nucleophile water (5Versées W. Decanniere K. Pellé R. Depoorter J. Brosens E. Parkin D.W. Steyaert J. J.

Here, the LG of the substrate is stacked between the two indole side chains of Trp83 and Trp260 (Fig. 2A). A novel catalytic mechanism in which the arene-arene stacking interaction between Trp260 and the purine LG substantially increases the latter's pKa at N-7, thus facilitating its protonation by solvent, has been proposed (10Versees W. Loverix S. Vandemeulebroucke A. Geerlings P. Steyaert J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Substrate-assisted catalysis was suggested as an additional mechanism for leaving group activation via hydrogen bond formation between the O-5′ of the ribose moiety and the C-8 hydrogen of the purine leaving group (11Loverix S.

In the unliganded structures of TvNH, two flexible loops at opposite sides of the active site, called loop 1 and 2, are present with low or no associated electron density. Loop 1 is located at the C-terminal end of β3 and comprises residues 75-85; loop 2 is situated at the C-terminal end of a long α-helix and comprises residues 244-258. Binding of the ground state inhibitor 3-deaza-adenosine to wild type TvNH as well as binding of the substrate inosine to a slow mutant of this enzyme orders loop 1 (6Versées W. Decanniere K. Van Holsbeke E. Devroede N. Steyaert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15938-15946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ordering of loop 1 brings Trp83 into a parallel stacking interaction with the nucleobase. Recently, we also solved the structure of TvNH in complex with the transition state analogue inhibitor immucillin-H (ImmH) (12Versees W. Barlow J. Steyaert J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this structure, loop 1 and loop 2 are ordered. Loop 2 folds over the active site, establishing a previously unobserved closed conformation of the active site of TvNH (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the ordered loop 1 of one subunit of the dimeric protein interacts with the ordered loop 2 of the other subunit, and vice versa. A mechanism of loop closure has been proposed that links binding of the substrate's 2′-OH group via a conformational change of Asp14 and Trp242 to loop closure. The Trp260 side chain approaches N-7 of the LG by 0.6 Å in the transition state structure, corroborating its central role in leaving group activation. In this closed conformation, the N-7 of the purine does not interact with any amino acid residue but is connected to bulk solvent by a network of highly ordered water molecules. This water channel, possibly aided by the polar residues of loop 2 lining it (e.g. Arg252 and Asp255), can act as a proton relay system shuttling protons directly to the high pKa N-7. All structural findings suggest an important catalytic role for the flexible loop residues. In this paper, we set out to test this hypothesis by mutagenesis and x-ray crystallography. However, interpretations of effects of mutagenesis on TvNH activity based on steady-state parameters are potentially misleading due to its complex kinetic mechanism. Indeed, a detailed kinetic analysis of TvNH has allowed the assignment of transients corresponding to binding, chemistry, base release, and ribose release (13Vandemeulebroucke A. Versees W. Steyaert J. Barlow J.N. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9307-9318Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Together, this pre-steady state characterization has led to the development of a detailed kinetic mechanism (Scheme 1). The kinetic model is based on fast chemistry (N-glycosidic bond cleavage), followed by an ordered product release. Dissociation of the base precedes the slow overall rate-limiting ribose release. Binding experiments have shown that ribose release in itself is a two-step process consisting of a rate-limiting isomerization of a tightly bound enzyme-ribose complex to a loosely bound complex from which ribose can easily dissociate. The development of this model permitted us to examine the effects of mutagenesis on these individual processes. The here reported analysis of the catalytic role of the flexible loop 2 in the mechanism of TvNH suggests an important function in LG activation. The loop presumably closes over the active site during catalysis, thereby ordering a water channel that is involved in LG activation. Once chemistry has taken place, the loop dynamics determine the rate of product release. Production of the Mutant TvNHs—The TvNH open reading frame was cloned into the BamHI-HindIII restriction sites of the pQE-30 plasmid (Qiagen) and used as the template for all in vitro mutagenic studies. The individual mutations in the loop region (proline scan) were created using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The loop deletion mutant (3GTvNH) was created using a primer extension overlap PCR. A forward primer and a complementary reverse primer containing the codons for three glycine residues replacing the 13 loop residues were used together with a general reverse and forward primer for the pQE-30 plasmid to generate the 3′ and 5′ fragments of the mutated open reading frame. A second PCR with the general primers was used to link both fragments together. This PCR product was recloned in the pQE-30 plasmid using the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. Expression and Purification—Expression and purification of the wild type and mutant TvNHs were performed as described previously (5Versées W. Decanniere K. Pellé R. Depoorter J. Brosens E. Parkin D.W. Steyaert J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1363-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli cells (WK6) containing the TvNH open reading frame cloned in the pQE-30 expression vector were used to express the protein. The presence of an N-terminal His6 tag allowed for a two-step purification scheme, consisting of an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography step (Qiagen), followed by a gel filtration on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences). General Procedures for Kinetic Analysis—The concentrations of nucleosides and purine stock solutions were determined using the following extinction coefficients (14Dunn D.B. Hall R.H. Sober E.K. CRC Handbook of Biochemistry. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1970Google Scholar): ϵ253 = 13.6 mm-1 cm-1 for guanosine; ϵ258 = 8.5 mm-1 cm-1 for 7-methylguanosine; ϵ260 = 1 mm-1 cm-1 for 2-aminopurine; and ϵ248.5 = 12.3 mm-1 cm-1 for inosine. Nucleosides and purine solutions were freshly made in deionized water. Once thawed, enzyme stocks were kept at 4 °C and used over a period of several days but never refrozen to avoid activity loss. All kinetic measurements were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffers, adjusted with NaCl to a constant ionic strength of 200 mm. Steady State Kinetics—Initial rate kinetic measurements were carried out at 25 °C and pH 7.0. Product formation was analyzed spectrophotometrically using the difference in absorption between the nucleoside and the base. The Δϵ values (mm-1 cm-1) used were as follows: guanosine, -4.0 at 260 nm; 7-methylguanosine, -4.4 at 258 nm; and 2-aminopurine riboside, -2.29 at 250 nm. All data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Origin (Microcal). Kinetic parameters were calculated per active site. To determine the inhibition constants for the ImmH, we analyzed the influence of ImmH on the steady state parameters of inosine hydrolysis. Xanthine oxidase was used in a coupled assay to monitor inosine hydrolysis at 25 °C and pH 7.5 (optimal pH of xanthine oxidase). By adding xanthine oxidase, the reaction product hypoxanthine is oxidized to uric acid, which can be monitored spectrophotometrically at 293 nm (ϵ293 uric acid, 12.9 mm-1 cm-1). Reactions were started by adding the NH enzyme to the reaction mixture containing 500 μm inosine, 120 milliunits of xanthine oxidase/ml, and variable concentrations of inhibitor. Inhibition data were analyzed using the linearized plots of Dixon. Solvent Isotope Effect Measurements—The solvent isotope effect measurements were performed as described previously (15Barlow J.N. Steyaert J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1774: 1451-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The pD of the buffer made up in deuterium oxide was adjusted with DCl, and the pD meter reading was corrected using the relation, pD = (meter reading) + 0.4. The buffers were used on the day of making and consisted of 50 mm phosphate buffers at 0.2 m ionic strength with NaCl and pL = 7.0. The enzymes were not exchanged into D2O-containing buffer, but the final concentration of H2O was <0.001%. No change in enzyme activity was observed in D2O-containing buffer after 3 h of incubation on ice. Guanosine was used as a substrate for the initial rate kinetic measurements at 25 °C. Stopped Flow Methods—Stopped flow analysis was performed on an Applied Photophysics model SX18.MV stopped flow spectrofluorimeter fitted with a xenon lamp. All experiments were performed at 5 °C and pH 7.0. All reported concentrations correspond to final concentrations in the reaction chamber after mixing. Progress curves were averaged (generally 10-14 shots) and corrected for background signal changes by subtracting the averaged progress curve for a sample containing substrate only (for absorption measurements) or enzyme only (for fluorescence measurements). Multiple turnovers of substrate (excess of substrate over enzyme) were analyzed by stopped flow absorbance using the difference in absorption between the nucleoside and the base. For these absorption measurements, the photomultiplier voltage corresponding to zero absorbance was set using water in the observation cell (with a 1-cm path length). During multiple substrate turnover and ligand binding, changes in the enzyme tryptophan fluorescence were measured with excitation at 280 nm and detection above 305 nm, using a 305 nm cut-off filter. For the fluorescence experiments, the photomultiplier voltage was set at 80% of the full scale with the enzyme at the working concentration in buffer and a path length of 0.2 cm. Single turnover experiments (excess of enzyme over substrate) were analyzed by stopped flow fluorescence using the fluorescent substrate 2-aminopurine riboside. Changes in the substrate fluorescence during substrate turnover were measured with excitation at 312 nm and detection above 335 nm. The photomultiplier voltage was set at 80% of the full scale with the substrate at the working concentration in buffer and a path length of 0.2 cm. Rapid Quench Analysis—Rapid quench measurements were performed to follow the formation of guanine from guanosine by the 3GTvNH mutant at room temperature and pH 7.0 using a KinTek RQF-3 quenched flow apparatus. The excess of guanosine (1 mm) was mixed with 3GTvNH (50 μm) for various reaction times and quenched with acid (0.4 m HCl). Control samples of guanosine mixed with quencher were also collected and treated the same as the other samples. Samples were kept on ice and filtered at 4 °C using wetted Microcon centrifugal device microconcentrators (YM-30, regenerated cellulose, 30-kDa cut-off; Amicon). The amount of guanine was quantified using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, as described previously (5Versées W. Decanniere K. Pellé R. Depoorter J. Brosens E. Parkin D.W. Steyaert J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1363-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The guanine concentration was calculated from a guanine standard curve using the following equation, [guanine]=(AreaG−AreaCslope)×DF(Eq. 1) where AreaG represents the area of the guanine peak in the reaction sample, AreaC is the area of the guanine peak in the control sample, slope is the gradient of the guanine standard curve (units of area per micromolar guanine), and DF is the dilution factor. Pre-steady State Data Analysis—Linear and nonlinear curve fittings to progress curves were performed using Microsoft Origin version 7. The first 2 ms of the progress curves were discarded. Goodness of fit was estimated by visual inspection of residuals. The fitting functions used have the general form,y(t)=∑iAiexp(−kit)+vt+C(Eq. 2) where y(t) represents the observed signal at time t, i is the number of transients in the progress curves, Ai is the amplitude of the ith transient, ki is the observed rate constant for the ith transient, v is the steady-state velocity, and C is the offset. The fitted parameters were used to make plots of observed rate constants versus substrate or ribose concentrations. The concentration dependences of the different observed rate constants were analyzed as described previously (13Vandemeulebroucke A. Versees W. Steyaert J. Barlow J.N. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9307-9318Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—Crystals of the 3GTvNH·ImmH complex were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. A protein solution (9.7 mg/ml) was preincubated with 0.7 mm ImmH and 2 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 4 °C. Equal volumes of the protein solution and precipitant solution containing 20% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 0.25 m ammonium sulfate in 10 mm potassium acetate, pH 5.0, were mixed and equilibrated at 20 °C. The crystals were soaked in a cryosolution containing 35% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.5 m ammonium sulfate, and 30 μm ImmH in 10 mm potassium acetate, pH 5. After several minutes, crystals were transferred to the cryostream (100 K), and data were collected to a resolution of 1.4 Å on beamline X11 (EMBL, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany). The diffraction data were integrated, scaled, and merged with the HKL package (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38520) Google Scholar). Intensities were converted to structure factors using TRUNCATE (17French S. Wilson K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 517-525Crossref Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Relevant statistics for the data set are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsParametersValuesDiffraction dataSpace groupP21A (Å)54.18B (Å)74.88C (Å)72.42β (deg)98.07Resolution range (Å)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.40-1.4 (1.45-1.4)Rsym (%)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.7.2 (60.5)I/σaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.20.36 (2.19)Completeness (%)100 (99.8)Redundancy4.6 (3.6)Structure refinementRcryst (%)17.73Rfree (%)20.43Root mean square deviation for bond lengths (Å)0.008Root mean square deviation for bond angles (deg)1.252Ramachandran plot (% favoured, allowed, outliers)98.51, 100, 0No. of atoms/atomic unit5668a Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The coordinates of one monomer of the wild-type TvNH (Protein Data Bank code 1HOZ, with all of the ligands and flexible parts removed) were used as a search model to solve the structure of the co-crystallized 3GTvNH·ImmH complex by molecular replacement using the program PHASER (18McCoy A.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). The same set of reflections for cross-validation was used. To remove model bias maximally and to fill up the gaps in the model, the solution from the molecular replacement was subjected to 10 rounds of automated model building (WarpN-trace) in ARP/WARP (19Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The model from ARP/WARP was checked, corrected, and further built in COOT (20Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23213) Google Scholar). Several cycles of refinement using REFMAC (21Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13850) Google Scholar) were alternated with manual rebuilding in σA-weighted (2Fo - Fc, φc) and (Fo - Fc, φc) electron density maps using COOT. The maps in both active sites in the asymmetric unit showed unambiguous electron density for the inhibitor. The completed model contains two chains of 317 amino acids, two ImmH molecules (both in alternative conformations), two calcium ions, and 773 water molecules. Relevant statistics for the refinement are given in Table 1. Figures were prepared with Pymol (22DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Delano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Proline Scan of the Flexible Loop 2—It had previously been suggested that residues from the flexible loop 2 are involved in LG group activation (6Versées W. Decanniere K. Van Holsbeke E. Devroede N. Steyaert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15938-15946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, all residues in loop 2 have been mutated to alanines. Tyr257 and Tyr258 have additionally been replaced by phenylalanines. None of these mutants seemed to have a negative effect on catalysis (kcat), but some showed a significant increase in Km. Remarkably, replacing Arg252 with alanine increases the turnover almost 5-fold. The same phenomenon is observed to a lesser extent in the Y257A and Y258F mutants. In the current study, we extended this analysis and additionally mutated the seven residues that are located in the center of the loop one after the other to proline to further investigate whether the main chain amines of the flexible loop residues make a contribution to catalysis. The steady state kinetic parameters of these mutants with guanosine as a substrate are compared with the corresponding values for the wild type enzyme (wtTvNH). The same trend is observed as for the alanine scan of the flexible loop 2 (Table 2); none of these single site mutants show a drastic effect on the steady state parameters. Interestingly, the R252P mutation again has a positive effect on the catalytic turnover rate of guanosine.TABLE 2Comparison of steady state kinetic parameters of mutant and wild type TvNH at 25 °C and pH 7.0TvNHkcatKmkcat/Kms−1μmm−1s−1GuanosineWild type2.3 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.5(1.0 ± 0.2) × 106H247P4.1 ± 0.48 ± 3(5 ± 2) × 105C248P1.09 ± 0.064 ± 1(2.7 ± 0.7) × 105E249P1.7 ± 0.13 ± 1(4 ± 1) × 105L250P1.4 ± 0.116 ± 4(8 ± 2) × 104L251P2.5 ± 0.121 ± 4(1.2 ± 0.2) × 105R252P13 ± 124 ± 6(5 ± 1) × 105D253P3.9 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.6(2.2 ± 0.7) × 1063G1.52 ± 0.09266 ± 60(6 ± 1) × 1032-Aminopurine ribosideWild type0.57 ± 0.039 ± 3(6 ± 2) × 1053G0.22 ± 00330 ± 15(7 ± 4) × 1047-MethylguanosineWild type1.07 ± 0.020.5 ± 0.1(2.1 ± 0.4) × 1073G56 ± 215 ± 2(3.7 ± 0.5) × 107 Open table in a new tab Pre-steady State Analysis of R252A Mutant—Arginine 252 is located at the tip of loop 2 and is translocated into the active site to form an interaction with the substrate upon loop closure (12Versees W. Barlow J. Steyaert J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and B). Mutations of this arginine to either alanine or proline are the only loop mutations that have a significant effect on the catalytic turnover rate (6Versées W. Decanniere K. Van Holsbeke E. Devroede N. Steyaert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15938-15946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (increase of kcat). All of this indicates that arginine 252 has a functional role in the catalytic mechanism of TvNH. Because the TvNH exhibits a complex multistep kinetic mechanism with an overall rate-limiting ribose release (23Vandemeulebroucke A. Versees W. De Vos S. Van Holsbeke E. Steyaert J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12902-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we also performed a pre-steady state kinetic analysis on the R252A TvNH mutant. Multiple turnovers of guanosine by R252A TvNH, analyzed by stopped flow absorbance, show a biphasic burst of guanine production similar to wtTvNH (Fig. 3A). In the R252A TvNH reaction, a fast chemistry step (N-glycosidic bond cleavage) is followed by slower product release. The concentration dependence of the burst rates (data not shown) reveals comparable apparent rates of chemistry (k2 and k2′ in Scheme 1) for wild type and mutant TvNH. Previously, we have shown that multiple turnovers of purine nucleosides by wtTvNH analyzed by stopped flow fluorescence allow the assignment of transients to substrate binding and base release (13Vandemeulebroucke A. Versees W. Steyaert J. Barlow J.N. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9307-9318Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Progress curves of guanosine hydrolysis by R252A TvNH also consist of two transients that correspond to substrate binding and base release (Fig. 3B). The concentration dependences of the observed rate constants (k1, k-1, and k3 in Scheme 1) indicate that the R252A mutation has no drastic effects on these processes. In the next step, ribose binding to the R252A mutant was analyzed by stopped flow fluorescence. The concentration dependence of the observed rates of ribose binding shows that this process occurs via the same two-step binding mechanism as seen for the wild type enzyme (23Vandemeulebroucke A. Versees W. De Vos S. Van Holsbeke E. Steyaert J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12902-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This two-step binding mechanism consists of a first collision step (Kri-bose in Scheme 1) to form a loosely bound enzyme ribose complex, followed by an isomerization that converts this loosely bound complex into a tightly bound complex (k4 and k-4 in Scheme 1). In the reverse direction, this isomerization is very slow (k4) and is the overall rate-determining step for purine hydrolysis catalyzed by wtTvNH. The rate of this isomerization (k4) is increased from 0.06 s-1 for the wild type enzyme to 2.7 s-1 for the R252A mutant. The rate of ribose release is identical to the steady state turnover rate of guanosine and hence determines the steady state rate of the R252A mutant. To summarize, the increase in the catalytic turnover of guanosine by the R252A mutant compared with wtTvNH results from a faster ribose release in the mutant. In the process of ribose release of the R252A TvNH-catalyzed reaction, the isomerization (k4) prior to ribose dissociation, however, remains the overall rate-limiting step (Table 3).TABLE 3Comparison of pre-steady state kinetic parameters of mutant and wild type TvNH at 5 °C and pH 7.0TvNH substrateSubstrate bindingChemistryBase releaseRibose releasek1k−1k1′k−1′k2k2′k3k4k−4KDμm−1 s−1s−1μm−1 s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1mmWild type guanosineaData taken from Ref. 13.1.2426NObNO, not observed.NO828.5250.062167Wild type 7mguo2.146NONO24015200.062167R252A guanosine0.7225NONO1006.5252.7626753G guanosine1.8730.150.06NONO6.221383G 7mguoToo fastToo fastNONO>300NO>2006.22138a Data taken from Ref. 13Vandemeulebroucke A.

https://openalex.org/W2070667507,"Heterotrimeric G-proteins are integral to a conserved regulatory module that influences metazoan asymmetric cell division (ACD). In the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, GOA-1 (Galpha(o)) and GPA-16 (Galpha(i)) are involved in generating forces that pull on astral microtubules and position the spindle asymmetrically. GPA-16 function has been analyzed in vivo owing notably to a temperature-sensitive allele gpa-16(it143), which, at the restrictive temperature, results in spindle orientation defects in early embryos. Here we identify the structural basis of gpa-16(it143), which encodes a point mutation (G202D) in the switch II region of GPA-16. Using Galpha(i1)(G202D) as a model in biochemical analyses, we demonstrate that high temperature induces instability of the mutant Galpha. At the permissive temperature, the mutant Galpha was stable upon GTP binding, but switch II rearrangement was compromised, as were activation state-selective interactions with regulators involved in ACD, including GoLoco motifs, RGS proteins, and RIC-8. We solved the crystal structure of the mutant Galpha bound to GDP, which indicates a unique switch II conformation as well as steric constraints that suggest activated GPA-16(it143) is destabilized relative to wild type. Spindle severing in gpa-16(it143) embryos revealed that pulling forces are symmetric and markedly diminished at the restrictive temperature. Interestingly, pulling forces are asymmetric and generally similar in magnitude to wild type at the permissive temperature despite defects in the structure of GPA-16(it143). These normal pulling forces in gpa-16(it143) embryos at the permissive temperature were attributable to GOA-1 function, underscoring a complex interplay of Galpha subunit function in ACD."

In striated muscle Z-disks, α-actinin interacts with N-terminal domains of titin to provide a structural linkage crucial for the integrity of the sarcomere. We previously discovered a long titin isoform, originally smitin, hereafter sm-titin, in smooth muscle and demonstrated that native sm-titin interacts with C-terminal EF hand region and central rod R2-R3 spectrin-like repeat region sites in α-actinin. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of RNA from human adult smooth muscles and cultured rat smooth muscle cells and Western blot analysis with a domain-specific antibody presented here revealed that sm-titin contains the titin gene-encoded Zq domain that may bind to the α-actinin R2-R3 central rod domain as well as Z-repeat domains that bind to the EF hand region. We investigated whether the sm-titin Zq domain binds to α-actinin R2 and R3 spectrin repeat-like domain loops that lie in proximity with two-fold symmetry on the surface of the central rod. Mutations in α-actinin R2 and R3 domain loop residues decreased interaction with expressed sm-titin Zq domain in glutathione S-transferase pull-down and solid phase binding assays.

Smooth muscle cells use an extensively organized but poorly understood actin-myosin contractile apparatus to generate force for physiological requirements such as blood pressure regulation, airway constriction, and gut peristalsis. Dynamic changes in the organization of this contractile apparatus support a remarkable degree of smooth muscle cell mechanical and phenotypic plasticity in response to physiological cues (1Gerthoffer W.T. Gunst S.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 2Seow C.Y. Pratusevich V.R. Ford L.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mechanical plasticity enables a smooth muscle cell to adapt to chronic or transient changes in cell length or load by reorganizing its contractile apparatus to maintain maximal force-generating capability (3Ford L.E.

Phenotypic plasticity permits a smooth muscle cell to convert reversibly from a “contractile” state, in which it can generate force for contraction, to a “synthetic” state, in which it can proliferate and migrate to participate in angiogenesis and wound healing or pathological formation of atherosclerotic plaques and thickening of arterial walls (5Nakamura A.

Conversion between the contractile and synthetic phenotypic states involves changes in the expression and organization of smooth muscle contractile apparatus proteins (9Halayko A.J. Solway J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Some of these changes have been defined, but most of the underlying structural and molecular mechanisms supporting smooth muscle contractile apparatus organization and its plasticity have yet to be elucidated. Although there are significant structural and stability differences, certain properties of the smooth muscle contractile apparatus organization resemble those of the better understood striated muscle sarcomere (10Herrera A.M. McParland B.E. Bienkowska A. Tait R. Pare P.D. Seow C.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2381-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Both striated and smooth muscle contractile systems contain antiparallel arrays of actin filaments, each of which anchors to one of a pair of α-actinin-containing functionally homologous structures, the striated muscle sarcomere Z-disk or the smooth muscle dense body. The myosin filaments, large bipolar filaments in striated muscles and large side-polar filaments in smooth muscle, interdigitate with antiparallel actin filaments and use similar crossbridge cycles of force production on actin filaments to pull the Z-disks and dense bodies closer together. In striated muscles, a third major set of filaments, each of which is composed of a single molecule of the protein titin, organizes and stabilizes the sarcomere structure (11Linke W.A. Cardiovasc.

Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 89-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Complete sequences of the human titin gene and of several differentially spliced titin gene transcripts expressed in vertebrate striated muscles are known (15Bang M.L. Centner T. Fornoff F.

The longest striated muscle titin isoforms (∼1.0-μm-contour-length molecules composed of ∼28,000 amino acids) are elastic and span each half-sarcomere, with anchorage points in the Z-disk and M-line and on the myosin filaments. Titin filaments play important roles in sarcomere assembly, stability, and passive tension, as well as in stretch sensing, protein turnover, and gene regulation through interactions with other proteins including α-actinin (11Linke W.A.

We found a long isoform of the protein titin (originally named smitin, hereafter called sm-titin) 3The abbreviations used are: sm-titin, smooth muscle titin; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild type; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; Zr, Z-repeat. 3The abbreviations used are: sm-titin, smooth muscle titin; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild type; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; Zr, Z-repeat. in the smooth muscle contractile apparatus (18Kim K. Keller T.C. II I J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The existence of titin isoforms in smooth muscle recently has been confirmed by others (19Labeit S. Lahmers S. Burkart C. Fong C. McNabb M. Witt S. Witt C. Labeit D. Granzier H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 664-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that sm-titin interacts in vitro with smooth muscle myosin (18Kim K. Keller T.C. II I J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle α-actinin (20Chi R.J. Olenych S.G. Kim K. Keller T.C. II I Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1470-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is likely that the sm-titin-α-actinin interaction plays major roles in establishing and maintaining the smooth muscle contractile apparatus and in regulating it dynamic organization. Determining the molecular basis for sm-titin-α-actinin interaction will yield valuable insight into this undoubtedly important linkage. Smooth muscle α-actinin is localized in dense bodies, the functional equivalents of Z-discs in the smooth muscle contractile apparatus (21Small J.V. Gimona M. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The smooth muscle α-actinin is one of several isoforms of α-actinin encoded by a family of genes that are differentially expressed in different tissues (22Dixson J.D. Forstner M.J. Garcia D.M. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 56: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All α-actinins exist as rod-shaped antiparallel homodimers. Each monomer contains an actin-binding domain at the N terminus, four spectrin-like triple helical repeat regions (R1–4) in the central rod domain, and four C-terminal end cryptic calmodulin-like EF-hands (EF1–4), which in striated and smooth muscle isoforms fail to bind Ca2+. In the striated muscle sarcomere, interaction with N-terminal domains of titin localizes α-actinin in the Z-disk and specifies the number of α-actinin cross-links between overlapping actin filaments (23Sorimachi H. Freiburg A. Kolmerer B. Ishiura S. Stier G. Gregorio C.C. Labeit D. Linke W.A. Suzuki K. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This key structural linkage is required for the assembly and structural integrity of the vertebrate striated muscle sarcomere (24Young P. Ferguson C. Banuelos S. Gautel M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 1614-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Disruption of this interaction by expression of a dominant-negative titin fragment causes sarcomere breakdown (25Ayoob J.C. Turnacioglu K.K. Mittal B. Sanger J.M. Sanger J.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two types of titin N-terminal domains interact with two different sites on α-actinin. One type of titin-α-actinin interaction involves binding any of seven differentially spliced 45-residue titin Z-repeat (Zr) domains to the EF34 set of cryptic EF-hand motifs in the C-terminal domain of each monomer on each end of the α-actinin antiparallel dimer (24Young P. Ferguson C. Banuelos S. Gautel M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 1614-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The structure of this interaction revealed how an α-helical region of the titin Zr7 domain lies in a groove formed by the EF34 domain in striated muscle α-actinin (26Joseph C. Stier G. O'Brien R. Politou A.S. Atkinson R.A. Bianco A. Ladbury J.E. Martin S.R. Pastore A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4957-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Atkinson R.A. Joseph C. Kelly G. Muskett F.W.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that the sm-titin Zr7 domain interacts with similar cryptic EF hands near the C terminus of smooth muscle α-actinin, but regulation of this interaction appears to be different in striated and smooth muscles (20Chi R.J. Olenych S.G. Kim K. Keller T.C. II I Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1470-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A second type of interaction occurs between the striated muscle titin Zq domain and the second and third (R2-R3) spectrin-like triple helical repeats in the striated muscle α-actinin rod (24Young P. Ferguson C. Banuelos S. Gautel M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 1614-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this interaction remains very poorly characterized, even in the interaction between striated muscle titins and striated muscle α-actinin, in part because the entire R2-R3 region appears to be required for Zq binding. Here, we report characterization and molecular mapping of a similar interaction between the sm-titin Zq domain and the R2-R3 region of the smooth muscle α-actinin central rod (24Young P. Ferguson C. Banuelos S. Gautel M. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 1614-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Based on evidence presented here, we propose a model for how Zq domain interaction with loop regions of both R2 and R3 and with itself may contribute to the sm-titin-α-actinin linkage in smooth muscle. Smooth Muscle RT-PCR Analysis—RT-PCR analysis of commercially available human carotid artery, bladder, and uterus RNAs (Stratagene) and Trizol-isolated RNA from the A7r5 rat aorta smooth muscle cell line was used to determine whether a smooth muscle titin isoform contained known α-actinin-binding domains and the sequence of that region. Primers complementary to human and rat titin gene sequence encoding this region were designed using PrimerQuest (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). First strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and primers complementary to the sense strand of exons 20 and 28. Subsequent PCR amplification was done using forward and reverse primer pairs covering sequences in the 5′ end of human titin exons 1, 8, and 20 (forward) and the 3′ end of exons 14, 20, and 28 (reverse). The standard PCR protocol used included 35 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 0.5 °C below the lowest primer calculated melting temperature, and extension for 1 min/kb of possible product sequence at 68 °C. The length of products was assessed when compared with standards on an agarose gel and purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified products were sequenced in both directions using the PCR amplification primers and analyzed for exon-exon junctions to ensure mRNA origin. Forward primers used were designed from the sequences of exon 1, 5′CGTTTCAGAAGCAACCTTGGGCTT-3′; exon 8, 5′ACTGCTGTGCACATCCAACCTGCT-3′; and exon 20, 5′ACCTGCCGCGCCTTACTTTATTAC-3′. The reverse primers used were from exon 14, 5′TGACTGCTTTAGGGACAACGTGGG-3′; exon 20, 5′CCTGCTTGTTCCTCTGTGAGGCTA-3′; and exon 28, 5′TACCAGTTGACTTTGGGCTGAGGGT-3′. Fusion Protein Expression and Mutagenesis—The human sm-titin Zq domain was amplified from human carotid RNA using primers designed against the 5′ end of titin exon 15 and the 3′ end of titin exon 16, cloned into pET-15b vector (Invitrogen), and expressed as a C-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein in BL-21 (DE3) Escherichia coli. After nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Pierce) affinity chromatography, FPLC size exclusion chromatography through Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) run at a rate of 0.5 ml/min was used to remove minor contaminants. The human smooth muscle α-actinin spectrin-like repeat domain (ACTN1-R2-R3-GST) was cloned and expressed as a GST fusion protein, as described previously (20Chi R.J. Olenych S.G. Kim K. Keller T.C. II I Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1470-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Alanine and phosphomimetic mutations of α-actinin R2-R3 loop (K421A, Y423A, T425A, T427D, N586A, T590A, and N591A) and sm-titin Zq domain (S43A/Q53A/K64A) residues were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis with the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. For surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, purified ACTN1-R2-R3-GST was cleaved with thrombin (10 units, Sigma) according to manufacturer's recommendations and passed over immobilized glutathione agarose (Pierce) to isolate the ACTN1-R2-R3 domain. Purified WT-Zq and the S43A/Q53A/K64A-Zq triple mutant were purified to homogeneity (at least 95% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE) and dialyzed extensively into HBS-EP+ running buffer (Biacore Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). Protein concentrations were calculated using predicted extinction coefficients (ProtParam site at us.expasy.org), and absorbance at 280 nm was obtained from a full wavelength scan using a Varian Cary 300 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blots of Native sm-Titin— Chicken striated pectoralis muscle and pig aorta and uterus tissues were obtained from local slaughterhouses. The tissues where transported to the laboratory on ice, minced, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and pulverized into powder. The powder was extracted using 1× SDS-sample buffer. The SDS extract was fractionated on highly porous 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide, as described previously (29Eilertsen K.J. Keller T.C.S. II I J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The gel was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose using semidry blot transfer system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and stained using Ponceau S. The blots were blocked in 5.0% nonfat dry milk for 1–2 h at room temperature. The anti-TKZ rabbit polyclonal primary antibody raised in the T. Keller laboratory against an expressed titin region containing the Z-repeats Zr1, Zr2, Zr3, and Zr7 and the Zq domain, as described previously (30Cavnar P.J. Olenych S.G. Keller T.C. II I Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2007; 64: 418-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), was applied to the membrane and incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature. The membrane then was washed extensively in TBS-Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The chemiluminescent signal was developed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (according to the manufacturer's recommendations). Immunolocalization of sm-Titin in Cryosections and Cultured Cells—A segment of porcine aorta obtained from a slaughterhouse was placed into ice-cold cryoprotectant solution containing sucrose-phosphate and fixed overnight in a solution containing freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde and 0.1% Triton-X-100. The frozen aorta was cross-sectioned at a thickness of 10 μm in a cryostat. The sections were collected on 2% gelatin-coated slides, and the cryosection slides were incubated with anti-TKZ polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:100) followed by Alexa Fluor 488-coupled secondary antibody (diluted 1:500), mounted with ProLong® Gold mounting medium (Invitrogen), and viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 (Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). The A7r5 rat aorta and human coronary artery smooth muscle cells were grown on Nafion®-coated coverslips for 3–4 days (31Salloum D.S. Olenych S.G. Keller T.C. Schlenoff J.B. Biomacromolecules. 2005; 6: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100-phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. To minimize nonspecific binding, the coverslips were blocked in 10% goat serum, 0.05% Triton X-100-phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min before incubation at 37 °C for 1 h each in the anti-TKZ polyclonal antibody primary (diluted 1:100) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated (diluted 1:300) secondary antibodies. The A7r5 cells were double-labeled with phalloidin (rhodamine) and the anti-TKZ polyclonal antibody. The human coronary artery cells were labeled with only the anti-TKZ polyclonal antibody. These coverslips were observed with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS laser confocal microscope. ACTN1-R2-R2-GST Binding Assays—ACTN1-R2-R3-GST or mutations were purified to homogeneity and immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads (1 mg/ml). Purified sm-titin Zq domain (0.5 mg/ml) was dialyzed into interaction buffer containing 100 mm KCl and 0.2% Triton X-100 and mixed with the ACTN1-R2-R3-GST beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with interaction buffer, and eluted with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The amount of sm-titin Zq binding was assessed by SDS-PAGE of the elutant. All pull-down experiments were done in duplicate. Solid-phase protein binding assay using microtiter plates was performed as described previously (20Chi R.J. Olenych S.G. Kim K. Keller T.C. II I Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1470-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For these experiments, microtiter plate wells were coated with expressed sm-titin Zq domain and incubated with ACTN1-R2-R2-GST in 100 mm KCl, 0.2% Triton X-100. The amount of ACTN1-R2-R2-GST bound was assessed with anti-GST antibody (1:1000; Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO). The mean value and standard error were calculated from three separate experiments. Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—For these experiments, 2000 resonance units of ACTN1-R2-R3 domain in 10 mm acetate pH 4.5 were immobilized on a Series S sensor chip CM5 (Biacore Life Sciences) using amine coupling chemistry. The sm-titin Zq domain (WT-Zq) or mutant Zq domain (S43A/Q53A/K64A-Zq) was dialyzed extensively into HBS-EP+ running buffer (Biacore Life Sciences), flowed over the chip at a rate of 10 μl/min (300 s of contact time), and regenerated with running buffer containing 1 m NaCl (30 μl/min). To determine steady state affinity, binding of various concentrations (0–12.8 μm) of WT-Zq or S43A/Q53A/K64A-Zq were assayed. Binding constants were extrapolated from response (resonance units) versus time (seconds) values using the Biacore Life Sciences T-100 analysis software. For relative ranking studies, WT-Zq and S43A/Q53A/K64A-Zq were included in the same experiment, and binding was compared directly from the resulting sensorgrams. All sensorgrams were double zeroed with values of the running buffer alone and from a reference cell consisting of activated/blocked surface and no ACTN1-R2-R3 domain. All experiments were done in duplicate using a Biacore Life Sciences T-100 system housed in the Florida State University College of Medicine Biomedical Proteomics Laboratory. Graphic Modeling and Sequence Alignment—The Visual Molecular Dynamic viewer (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) was used for theoretical modeling of the mutations in the loops of the α-actinin R2-R3 domain and modeling of the Zq domain binding to this region (Protein Data Bank 1SJJ). Sequence similarity and alignment were produced using ClustalW European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute) and Jalview (Barton Group, University of Dundee). Smooth Muscle RNA Contains a Titin Transcript Encoding Z-repeat and Zq α-Actinin-binding Domains—RT-PCR analysis of commercially available human carotid artery, uterus, and bladder total RNAs yielded cDNAs with sequences matching those of exons from the exon 1–28 region of the only known human titin gene. All cDNAs obtained lacked intron sequence and crossed predicted exon-exon boundaries, proving they arose from mRNA transcripts and not contaminating genomic DNA. The three smooth muscle RNA sources each yielded a single cDNA product (∼2100 bp) from a pair of primers designed to exon 1 and exon 14 of the titin gene that was significantly smaller than the predicted size of the product if all exon sequences were present. Sequence analysis verified the exclusion of exons 11–13, with all products bridging the exon boundary between exons 10 and 14 (Fig. 1). The excluded exons 11–13 encode the Z-repeats 4–6. The cDNA products obtained therefore encode the Z1 and Z2 Ig domains, the Zis1 unique sequence, and the α-actinin-binding domains known as the Z-repeats Zr1, Zr2, Zr3, and Zr7 and the Zq domain. The cDNA products obtained using primers designed to exons 20 and exon 28 contained the sequences of all known intervening exons (Fig. 1B). We found the same pattern of exon usage by similar RT-PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from rat aortic smooth muscle A7r5 cells grown in culture. Western Blot Demonstrates Presence of sm-Titin Protein in Smooth Muscle—To confirm the expression of titin containing the α-actinin-binding region in adult smooth muscle tissues, we raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti-TKZ) against the region encoded by cloned exons 8–14 expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria. Western blot analysis using the anti-TKZ antibody demonstrated a reactive band in crude extracts of porcine aorta and stomach smooth muscle (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3) that migrated at a rate similar to that of chicken skeletal muscle titin (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Lack of reactivity with any of the other bands in the crude extracts demonstrated the high titin specificity of the anti-TKZ antibody. Reactivity of the anti-TKZ antibody, which was raised against an expressed fragment encoded by titin gene sequence, with the protein previously identified by the laboratory as smitin confirms smitin as a smooth muscle isoform of titin. Henceforth, we will refer to this protein as sm-titin instead of smitin. Sm-Titin Immunolocalization—Immunofluorescence localization using the anti-TKZ antibody demonstrated the presence of sm-titin in porcine aorta and cultured smooth muscle cells (Fig. 3). In intact porcine aorta, anti-TKZ labeled the smooth muscle layer of the tissue and not the elastic filaments lining the aorta (Fig. 3, A and B). In cultured smooth muscle cells, the anti-TKZ antibody stained in a punctate pattern along the stress fiber-like contractile apparatus structures (Fig. 3, C–F). Loops in the R2-R3 Domain Mediate sm-Titin Binding—In reviewing a recent model of smooth muscle α-actinin structure (32Liu J. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it became apparent that loops from the spectrin-repeat R2 and R3 domains could constitute the unknown binding site for the sm-titin Zq domain. The structural model predicts that an R2 domain loop (residues 421–425) and an R3 domain loop (residues 586–591), which are 145 residues apart in the primary sequence, lie in proximity on the surface of the α-actinin monomer rod and that the sites from both monomers lie on the same side of the dimer (Fig. 4). The juxtaposition of these loops forms an apparent groove on the surface of the a-actinin rod that we hypothesized could constitute the binding site for a helical sm-titin Zq domain. We used pull-down experiments with alanine mutations of several R2 loop residues (K421A, Y424A, and T425A) and R3 loop residues (N586A, T590A, and N591A), and a phosphomimetic mutation of an R2 loop threonine residue (T427D) in a putative protein kinase CKII phosphorylation site (Thr-427-lsE), to investigate whether the predicted α-actinin R2 and R3 loops contribute to the site that binds the titin Zq domain. For the GST pull-down experiments, the R2-R3 domain region constructs were expressed as GST fusion proteins, and the titin Zq region was expressed as a His-tagged fragment. Glutathione-coupled beads efficiently pelleted the GST-R2-R3 domain alone (Fig. 5A, lane 6). A saturable amount of the Zq domain co-pelleted when bound to the wild type R2-R3 (Fig. 5A, lane 5), but none pelleted in the absence of the R2-R3 domain under the same conditions (Fig. 5B, lane 4). Alanine mutations of several residues from both the R2 loop domain and the R3 loop domain significantly decreased Zq binding indicated by the amount of Zq co-pelleted with the R2-R3 region (Fig. 5C). A solid phase binding assay, which revealed relative amounts of the R2-R3 domain wild type and mutant fragments bound to immobilized wild type titin Zq domain, confirmed the results of the pull-down assay. All of the R2-R3 domain mutants exhibited a significant decrease in binding when compared with the wild type binding, with those exhibiting the least interaction in the pull-down assay also yielding the least binding in the solid phase assay (Fig. 6). It is interesting to note that alanine mutation of both the R2-Thr-425 and the R3-Asn-586, which the model predicts to be in proximity, has significantly less effect on binding than mutation of each residue alone (data not shown). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that loops from the R2 and R3 domains combine to form a binding site for the titin Zq domain. Moreover, the effec"
https://openalex.org/W1982181829,"Eukaryotic DNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA) has a strand melting property that assists polymerases and helicases in resolving DNA secondary structures. Curiously, previous results suggested that human RPA (hRPA) promotes undesirable recombination by facilitating annealing of flaps produced transiently during DNA replication; however, the mechanism was not understood. We designed a series of substrates, representing displaced DNA flaps generated during maturation of Okazaki fragments, to investigate the strand annealing properties of RPA. Until cleaved by FEN1 (flap endonuclease 1), such flaps can initiate homologous recombination. hRPA inhibited annealing of strands lacking secondary structure but promoted annealing of structured strands. Apparently, both processes primarily derive from the strand melting properties of hRPA. These properties slowed the spontaneous annealing of unstructured single strands, which occurred efficiently without hRPA. However, structured strands without hRPA displayed very slow spontaneous annealing because of stable intramolecular hydrogen bonding. hRPA appeared to transiently melt the single strands so that they could bind to form double strands. In this way, melting ironically promoted annealing. Time course measurements in the presence of hRPA suggest that structured single strands achieve an equilibrium with double strands, a consequence of RPA driving both annealing and melting. Promotion of annealing reached a maximum at a specific hRPA concentration, presumably when all structured single-stranded DNA was melted. Results suggest that displaced flaps with secondary structure formed during Okazaki fragment maturation can be melted by hRPA and subsequently annealed to a complementary ectopic DNA site, forming recombination intermediates that can lead to genomic instability.

The core of this trimeric protein readily binds to ssDNA sequences with a defined 5′-3′ polarity (8de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Sugasawa K. Weterings E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H.

RPA contains six DNA-binding domains (DBD) distributed among the three subunits. The RPA70 subunit has the highest affinity for ssDNA with four DBDs, whereas the two smaller subunits have one DBD each (10Daughdrill G.W. Ackerman J. Isern N.G. Botuyan M.V. Arrowsmith C. Wold M.S.

Additionally, the N-terminal domain of RPA70 (DBD F) has been shown to be important for binding and melting double-stranded DNA, and for helix destabilization of short DNA strands (12Lao Y. Lee C.G. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3974-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Current models of RPA binding suggest that the domains actually used for binding are contingent on the length of the ssDNA to which the RPA is bound (13Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. J. Biol.

Structural studies have shown that two DBDs of RPA70 (DBD A and DBD B) can interact with an 8-nt segment of ssDNA and that longer DNAs interact with additional domains. The DBD located on RPA32 (DBD D) is thought to bind to the 3′-end of the ssDNA only in the highest affinity binding mode when all four domains are utilized, although a mutation in the D site does not affect RPA binding or function in vivo (15Bochkareva E.

DBD D has also been shown to bind the 3′-hydroxyl of a partial duplex (such as a primer-template junction), whereas the RPA70C domain is bound to the 5′ ssDNA overhang of the other DNA strand in the duplex.

Through various protein interactions, RPA may be directly placed on ssDNA after it emerges from a helicase complex to prevent the separated strands from reannealing or forming any secondary structure. The strand unwinding activities of yeast Srs2 and human RECQ1 helicases both benefit from the addition of RPA (21Cui S. Arosio D. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Falaschi A. Vindigni A.

Yeast RPA has also been shown to stimulate Pif1 helicase activity and aid in unwinding of both DNA-DNA substrates and DNA-RNA hybrids (25Boule J.B. Zakian V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5809-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The analogous single-stranded DNA-binding protein from Escherichia coli has been shown to remove secondary structure from ssDNA at high magnesium concentrations, allowing RecA to form presynaptic complexes, which ultimately facilitate strand annealing and exchange (26Kowalczykowski S.C.

In the first, RPA was found to reduce ssDNA with secondary structure during presynaptic complex formation, inhibiting nonproductive binding of RAD52 to those regions and thus streamlining its activity (28Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In the second, the addition of RPA stimulated RAD52-catalyzed annealing of long plasmid (2961 nt) DNA. The authors suggested that the role of RPA was to reduce secondary structure of the DNA so that it would be susceptible to the annealing and ultimately exchange activities of RAD52 (29Sugiyama T.

In DNA replication, Okazaki fragments are processed by a pathway in which the 5′-end region of each fragment is displaced into a single-stranded flap for nucleolytic removal of the RNA primer (30Kao H.I.

Rev. 2006; 106: 453-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that some flaps become long enough to be coated by RPA (30Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 11: R842-R844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When we tested flap substrates with RPA-coated flaps, we were surprised to find that the RPA promoted annealing of the flap to other single-stranded template DNA (34Bartos J.D. Wang W. Pike J.E. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32227-32239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This result suggested that RPA alone can support rather than suppress recombination. The current study is focused on determining the conditions under which RPA can promote strand annealing. Materials—All oligonucleotides were obtained commercially from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Radionucleotide [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and the T4 polynucleotide kinase (labeling grade) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were of the best available commercial grade. Enzyme Expression and Purification—Recombinant human RPA was purified as described previously (35Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Substrates—Oligomer sequences are listed in Table 1. Sequences with the secondary structure required to inhibit strand annealing were designed with the help of the mfold software (version 3.2) by Zuker and Turner, available on the World Wide Web (36Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10234) Google Scholar). Using standard procedures, substrates T1 and T2 were radiolabeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The radiolabeled strands were purified on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequences (5′-3′)OligonucleotideSequenceRadiolabeled templatesT1 57-merTCG AGA CCT CTG TTT CCA AGT AAA ACG ACG GCC AGT GTG CGT AGC GTA CAA TAC GACT2 57-merTGG AAA AAA AAA AAA AAG TGA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA GGA AGGComplementary primersC1 57-merGTC GTA TTG TAC GCT ACG CAC ACT GGC CGT CGT TTT ACT TGG AAA CAG AGG TCT CGAC2 47-merACG CTA CGC ACA CTG GCC GTC GTT TTA CTT GGA AAC AGA GGT CTC GAC3 37-merCAC TGG CCG TCG TTT TAC TTG GAA ACA GAG GTC TCG AC4 20-merCTT GGA AAC AGA GGT CTC GAC5 17-merCAC TGG CCG TCG TTT TACC6 57-merCCT TCC TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TCA CTT TTT TTT TTT TTT CCAFlapsF1 63-merCAC TGG CCG TCG TTT TAC GGT CGT GAC TGG GAA AAC CAC CCG TCC ACC CGA CGC CAC CTC CTG Open table in a new tab Secondary Structures—All oligomers were analyzed using the mfold software (36Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10234) Google Scholar). The folding free energy change (ΔG) for each oligomer was calculated based on parameters set forth in previous work (37Peyret N. Prediction of Nucleic Acid Hybridization: Parameters and Algorithms, Ph.D. thesis. Wayne State University, Detroit, MI2000Google Scholar, 38SantaLucia Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1460-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) at salt concentrations of 40 mm KCl and 4 mm MgCl2 and an ambient temperature of 37 °C. A positive free energy change predicts that the oligomer should not fold into consistent structures beyond random coils. Such oligomers are described here as having no secondary structure. Only the hydrogen-bonding configuration of the lowest free energy structure was considered for each oligomer, although in many cases there were other predicted structures with higher free energies. Enzyme Assays—Reactions were performed in buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 4 mm MgCl2. Enzyme stocks were diluted in 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Each reaction contained 5 fmol of radiolabeled template (T1 or T2) and 20 fmol (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 or F1) or 10 fmol (C6) of unlabeled complementary strand in a 20-μl reaction mixture with varying amounts of the enzymes as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were initiated by mixing the labeled template and unlabeled complementary strand followed immediately by the addition of the enzyme. All assays were incubated at 37 °C for the time specified in the figure legend. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.25 volumes of helicase dyes (30% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanole) and immediately run on a native 8% polyacrylamide gel at 25 watts for 3 h. After vacuum drying, each gel was visualized and quantitated using a GE Healthcare PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant version 5.0 software from Molecular Dynamics. In all studies, the quantitated amounts of substrates and products were utilized to calculate the percentage of product formation from the product/(product + substrate) ratio. This method allows for the correction of any loading errors among lanes. The graphed data points were calculated by quantifying the pixel density of each band and subtracting the measurable background pixel density. The percentage of strand-annealing activity was calculated as the amount of labeled DNA in the final annealed product band divided by the total amount of DNA from all bands in the gel lane. All experiments were done in triplicate, and the error bars on each graph represent one S.D. in both directions. In most assays, 10-250 fmol of RPA was found to be sufficient for demonstrating strand annealing activities. At 50 fmol, RPA is approximately equimolar to the recombination intermediate complex because of all of the excess DNA needed to ensure that all (or almost all) of the labeled strand is in complex. Since each assay contained ∼50 fmol of single-stranded DNA, 100 fmol of RPA was used in all nontitration assays to maintain the 2:1 RPA/ssDNA ratio. We previously acquired evidence that RPA can accelerate the annealing of DNA strands (34Bartos J.D. Wang W. Pike J.E. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32227-32239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our current work is an investigation of the conditions and substrate structures that support RPA-catalyzed strand annealing. Design of Oligonucleotide Substrates to Assess the Strand Annealing Properties of RPA—We first questioned whether the efficiency of RPA-catalyzed strand annealing correlates with the amount of structure in the single strands prior to annealing. We designed single-stranded oligomers with different folding structures that can anneal in various pairs (Table 1). The folding program mfold (version 3.2) was used to predict the free energy change (ΔG) for conversion of each strand from random coil to its lowest free energy folded structure. The hydrogen-bonding patterns of the lowest energy folding structures of those oligonucleotides are shown (Fig. 1). Oligomers with a positive ΔG are more likely to form a random coil than any consistent secondary structure and are thus designated as unstructured. Strands are designated as either templates (T) or complementary (C) strands, in which each C strand is complementary to an equal length or longer template. Two different templates were synthesized; T1 is a 57-nt oligomer that folds with a ΔG of -2.95 kcal/mol, and T2 is a 57-nt oligomer expected to remain a random coil based on a ΔG for folding of 4.2 kcal/mol. Two oligonucleotides that bind near the center of T1 were created. C5 is an 18-nt oligomer lacking secondary structure and is thus predicted to remain in the random coil configuration. Under the reaction conditions employed, it binds rapidly to T1 in the absence of RPA. Flap F1 contains the same 18 nt as C5 but has an additional 45 nt that are not complementary to T1. When F1 binds T1, the 45-nt region remains as a 3′ flap. However, when F1 is unannealed, folding is energetically favored with ΔG of -5.71 kcal/mol. RPA Can Promote Strand Annealing—The addition of RPA caused a progressive increase in the level of F1-T1 strand annealing as measured by the creation of the dsDNA complex (Fig. 2B). In the absence of RPA, F1 bound very slowly to T1 in our assay (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-5). Strand annealing in the absence of RPA was linear, with a rate of 0.026% of the radiolabeled template annealed/min over the entire 60 min. Linearity is anticipated, since the measurement was made under initial rate conditions in which the concentration of starting substrates does not change substantially during the course of the reaction. Annealing of C5 with T1, representing the same annealing sequence, but without structure, also occurred linearly, but at a rate of 0.934%/min, or 36 times faster than T1-F1 annealing (Fig. 2, C and D). These results demonstrate the inhibitory effect of secondary structure in the longer strand. They also show no evidence of spontaneous unannealing. The rate of F1-T1 annealing increased with the amount of RPA added, culminating in the highest rate of 0.452% of the radiolabeled template annealed/min over the first 15 min with 250 fmol of RPA, a greater than 17-fold increase (Fig. 2A, lanes 6-30). Evidence that RPA Strand Annealing Derives in Part from Its Strand Melting Properties—We compared the effect of RPA on the rate of annealing of template T1 to the structured flap F1 and to structureless complementary strand C5. A basal level of 31% of the labeled T1 DNA annealed to C5 during the 15-min period in the absence of RPA (Fig. 3, lane 1), whereas only 0.2% annealed to F1 (Fig. 3, lane 6). Titration of RPA lowered the annealed amount of the T1-C5 complex to 8.6% at 250 fmol, a decrease of 3.5-fold (Fig. 3, lanes 2-5). At the same time, titration of RPA raised the annealing level of the T1-F1 complex to 7.6% at 250 fmol, an increase of 3.5-fold (Fig. 3, lanes 7-10). This suggests that RPA strand annealing/melting reaches an equilibrium of ∼8% annealed for the 18-nt segment that is annealing. A reasonable interpretation of this result is that RPA is most effective at promoting the annealing of highly structured substrates, such as T1-F1, that would otherwise anneal at a very slow rate. However, RPA also has a strand melting activity that must be operating during the annealing reaction. T1 and C5 anneal rapidly in the absence of RPA, presumably because they have little interfering structure (see Fig. 1). However, 250 fmol of RPA is a very effective inhibitor of the rapid annealing reaction. It is notable that the level of annealing at 250 fmol of RPA becomes similar in both T1-F1 and T1-C5 annealing (Fig. 3B), and we found that RPA can unanneal both T1-F1 and T1-C5 preformed complexes (data not shown). The behavior of the system is consistent with the interpretation that RPA is displaying two activities, melting and annealing. When rapid spontaneous annealing is possible, the primary observable activity of RPA is melting. The amount of annealed strands at 250 fmol of RPA is reflective of the opposing reactions. RPA accelerated the poor annealing of the more structured strands (Fig. 2A, lanes 21-30). At high RPA, both strand pairs behaved similarly, consistent with the interpretation that RPA allows the structured strands to anneal as if they had little structure. This would occur if melting of the structure in the unannealed strands promoted the annealing reaction. Attempting to Simulate the Effects of RPA with Heat—We reasoned that if RPA promotes annealing through strand melting, increased temperature should have an equivalent effect on annealing; increased temperature should reduce the dependence of annealing on RPA, because heat can also destabilize structure that could interfere with annealing of single strands. The reaction temperature was increased for annealing of 57-nt T1 and 18-nt C5 in the absence of RPA (Fig. 4A). We found that RPA inhibited strand annealing of the 57-nt template and 18-nt complementary oligomer in the same manner regardless of increased temperature. Without RPA, the level of strand annealing increased with temperature, from 9.8% at 25 °C to 21.4% at 37 °C to 43.4% at 50 °C (Fig. 4A, lanes 1, 7, and 13). We interpreted the result to mean that the increased temperature destabilized intramolecular hydrogen bonds in T1, allowing it to bind C5. With this strand pair, the addition of RPA did not simulate the increase in temperature. The addition of RPA at 50 °C caused the level of strand annealing to decrease 13-fold, from 43.4% in the absence of RPA to 3.3% in the presence of 250 fmol of RPA. This suggests that RPA was either melting the dsDNA T1-C5 complex or preventing it from forming. RPA had a negative effect on annealing at both low and high concentration, showing that it is very effective at disrupting the T1-C5 complex (Fig. 4B). Clearly, with this strand pair, RPA and increased temperature had different effects, most likely because the highest temperature employed did not hinder annealing or melt the double-stranded product. Annealing of T1 and 57-nt C1 in the absence of RPA displayed a similar positive response to temperature. As with the T1-C5 annealing, the level of strand annealing rose more than 34-fold with the increase in temperature, from 1.9% at 25 °C to 65.6% at 50 °C (Fig. 4A, lanes 19 and 31). Unlike with the previous strand pair, the addition of RPA augmented the effect of the temperature increase, raising the amount of strand annealing to 9.5% at 25 °C and 81% at 50 °C. This suggests that RPA and increased temperature had additive effects on breaking the intramolecular hydrogen bonds that stabilize T1 and C1 secondary structure. However, unlike with the 18-nt C5, the addition of RPA increased strand annealing from 14.9% in the absence of RPA to 40% in the presence of 100 fmol of RPA at 37 °C. This implies that RPA and increased temperate collaborated in removing secondary structure from T1 and C1 to promote annealing. However, once T1 and C1 were annealed, RPA had difficulty melting the resulting 57 nt/57 nt dsDNA structure like it could the 18 nt/57 nt T1-C5 structure because of the additional 75-kcal/mol difference in free energy. The similar and additive effects of RPA and temperature with the longer strand are consistent with the interpretation that RPA promotes annealing by melting secondary structure in the reactant strands. We further compared effects of temperature and RPA by annealing flap F1 to T1. This strand pair utilized the same 18 nt that comprise C5 for annealing but with the addition of a 47-nt flap to give the C strand secondary structure (Fig. 4E). At 25 °C, the annealing pattern looked very similar to that which occurred using C1, suggesting that the secondary structure of the single strands initially inhibited annealing but the presence of RPA partially alleviated the interfering structure (Fig. 4F). Increasing the temperature from 25 to 37 °C raised annealing to a high of 10.5% at 100 fmol of RPA. A further increase in temperature shifted the annealing pattern higher, since in the absence of RPA the temperature is enough to relieve secondary structure. Interestingly, at 250 fmol of RPA, there was a reduction in annealing, reminiscent of the pattern seen using 18-nt C5; however, the resulting drop was much less than that seen with C5. Some nucleotides in the noncomplementary part of F1 can potentially form bonds with T1, contributing extra binding stability compared with the T1-C5 pair. We conclude that, as seen with C1, F1 secondary structure inhibited annealing until RPA or heat could reduce that structure. However, as seen with 18-nt C5 but not with 57-nt C1, the 18 nt did not anneal with enough stability to keep the resulting double-stranded product from being melted in the presence of high amounts of RPA. RPA Hinders the Annealing of Short Strands and Facilitates Annealing of Long Strands—For strand pairs that do not form flaps on annealing, the hypothesis that RPA displays both annealing and melting activities predicts that RPA would be most effective at catalyzing the annealing of a template strand to progressively longer complementary strands. This prediction is based on two expected properties of longer strands. First, the longer complementary (C) strand would anneal with greater stability to the template strand, resisting the melting activity of RPA (as suggested by data in Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, the longer C strand would be more likely to have a greater negative free energy of folding, allowing it to respond more to the annealing function of the RPA. To test this idea, we measured the influence of RPA on the annealing rates of T1 to progressively longer co"
https://openalex.org/W2110736183,"NRIF3 is an estrogen-inducible nuclear receptor coregulator that stimulates estrogen receptor-α (ERα) transactivation functions and associates with the endogenous ER and its target gene promoter. p21-activated protein kinase 1 (Pak1) phosphorylates ERα at Ser305 and this modification is important in ERα transactivation function. Although ERα transactivation functions are regulated by co-activator activity of NRIF3, it remains unclear whether Pak1 could impact ER functions via a posttranslational modification of NRIF3. Here, we report that Pak1 phosphorylates NRIF3 at Serine28 and that NRIF3 binds to Pak1 in vitro and in vivo. We found that NRIF3 phosphorylation, co-activator activity and association with ERα increased following Pak1 phosphorylation of NRIF3's Ser28 and that activated ERα-Ser305 and NRIF3-Ser28 cooperatively support transactivation of ERα. NRIF3 expression increased significantly in cells with inducible Pak1 expression. We found that NRIF3 and ERα interaction, subcellular localization and ERα transactivation activity all increased in cells expressing the Pak1 phosphorylation-mimicking mutant NRIF3-Ser28Glu. Consistently, the NRIF3-Ser28Glu mutant exhibited an enhanced recruitment to the endogenous ER target genes and increased expression following estrogen stimulation. Finally, breast cancer cells with stable overexpression of NRIF3 showed increased proliferation and enhanced anchorage-independent growth. These findings suggest that NRIF3-Ser28 is a physiologic target of Pak1 signaling and contributes to the enhanced NRIF3 co-activator activity, leading to coordinated potentiation of ERα transactivation, its target gene expression and estrogen responsiveness of breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014881782,"Inactivation of factor Va (FVa) by activated protein C (APC) is a key reaction in the down-regulation of thrombin formation. FVa inactivation by APC is correlated with a loss of FXa cofactor activity as a result of three proteolytic cleavages in the FVa heavy chain at Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679. Recently, we have shown that heparin specifically inhibits the APC-mediated cleavage at Arg506 and stimulates cleavage at Arg306. Three-dimensional molecular models of APC docked at the Arg306 and Arg506 cleavage sites in FVa have identified several FVa amino acids that may be important for FVa inactivation by APC in the absence and presence of heparin. Mutagenesis of Lys320, Arg321, and Arg400 to Ala resulted in an increased inactivation rate by APC at Arg306, which indicates the importance of these residues in the FVa-APC interaction. No heparin-mediated stimulation of Arg306 cleavage was observed for these mutants, and stimulation by protein S was similar to that of wild type FVa. With this, we have now demonstrated that a cluster of basic residues in FVa comprising Lys320, Arg321, and Arg400 is required for the heparin-mediated stimulation of cleavage at Arg306 by APC. Furthermore, mutations that were introduced near the Arg506 cleavage site had a significant but modest effect on the rate of APC-catalyzed FVa inactivation, suggesting an extended interaction surface between the FVa Arg506 site and APC. Inactivation of factor Va (FVa) by activated protein C (APC) is a key reaction in the down-regulation of thrombin formation. FVa inactivation by APC is correlated with a loss of FXa cofactor activity as a result of three proteolytic cleavages in the FVa heavy chain at Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679. Recently, we have shown that heparin specifically inhibits the APC-mediated cleavage at Arg506 and stimulates cleavage at Arg306. Three-dimensional molecular models of APC docked at the Arg306 and Arg506 cleavage sites in FVa have identified several FVa amino acids that may be important for FVa inactivation by APC in the absence and presence of heparin. Mutagenesis of Lys320, Arg321, and Arg400 to Ala resulted in an increased inactivation rate by APC at Arg306, which indicates the importance of these residues in the FVa-APC interaction. No heparin-mediated stimulation of Arg306 cleavage was observed for these mutants, and stimulation by protein S was similar to that of wild type FVa. With this, we have now demonstrated that a cluster of basic residues in FVa comprising Lys320, Arg321, and Arg400 is required for the heparin-mediated stimulation of cleavage at Arg306 by APC. Furthermore, mutations that were introduced near the Arg506 cleavage site had a significant but modest effect on the rate of APC-catalyzed FVa inactivation, suggesting an extended interaction surface between the FVa Arg506 site and APC. The protein C pathway provides a major anticoagulant mechanism for the regulation of hemostasis by nullification of the procoagulant activities of FVIIIa and FVa, the cofactors in the tenase and prothrombinase complexes, respectively. Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent protein composed of a heavy chain and a light chain that are connected through a single disulfide bridge (1Stenflo J. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1984; 10: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The light chain is composed of an N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid-rich domain and two epidermal growth factor-like domains. The heavy chain contains a short (12 amino acid) signal peptide and the serine protease (peptidase) domain. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that three surface loops (37, 70, and 148, chymotrypsin numbering) in the serine protease domain of APC 2The abbreviations used are:APCactivated protein CDOPS1,2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserineDOPC1,2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineFVcoagulation factor VFVaactivated FVHBSHepes-buffered salineQRQrecombinant FV carrying the R306Q/R679Q mutationsRQQrecombinant FV carrying the R506Q/R679Q mutationsUFHunfractionated heparinELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 2The abbreviations used are:APCactivated protein CDOPS1,2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserineDOPC1,2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineFVcoagulation factor VFVaactivated FVHBSHepes-buffered salineQRQrecombinant FV carrying the R306Q/R679Q mutationsRQQrecombinant FV carrying the R506Q/R679Q mutationsUFHunfractionated heparinELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. form an extended FVa-binding site (2Friedrich U.

APC is able to cleave FVa, the nonenzymatic cofactor of FXa in the prothrombinase complex, at least at five peptide bonds, of which those at Arg306 and Arg506 are considered most important for the inactivation of FVa (8Kalafatis M.

FVa is a multidomain protein that consists of a 71/74-kDa light chain (A3, C1, and C2 domains) and a 105-kDa heavy chain (A1 and A2 domains) that are noncovalently associated. All APC cleavage sites are located in the FVa heavy chain (8Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of negatively charged phospholipids, the cleavages at Arg506 and Arg306 are primarily responsible for inactivation of FVa (11Nicolaes G.A. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C.

Cleavage of Arg506 is kinetically favored over the Arg306 cleavage (up to 20-fold rate difference) and results in an FVa inactivation intermediate with partial cofactor activity, whereas cleavage at Arg306 fully inactivates FVa (11Nicolaes G.A.

In the presence of its cofactor protein S, however, APC cleaves the Arg306 peptide bond with a rate that is approximately similar to that of cleavage at Arg506 (13Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A.

Heparin is a naturally occurring sulfated glycosaminoglycan that can be found in several organs and tissues of the human body, notably on the surface of endothelial cells that form the inner lining of our vasculature. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin are widely used as effective pharmacotherapeutics for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis. The anticoagulant functions of heparin are diverse and include stimulation of the inhibition of various coagulation factors (thrombin, FIXa, FXa, FXIa, and FXIIa) by antithrombin as well as inhibition of platelet functions (14Izaguirre G.

Apart from its anticoagulant functions, heparin also has anti-inflammatory properties as it modulates the production and release of proinflammatory factors (18Cornet A.D. Smit E.G. Beishuizen A. Groeneveld A.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 98: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Beside its anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory functions, heparin also regulates APC activity by stimulating the inhibition of APC by the serpin protein C inhibitor (2Friedrich U. Blom A.M. Dahlback B. Villoutreix B.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24122-24128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Glasscock L.N. Gerlitz B. Cooper S.T. Grinnell B.W. Church F.C.

In addition, it has been shown that heparin alters the pathway of APC-catalyzed FVa inactivation by inhibition of the Arg506 cleavage and stimulation of the Arg306 cleavage in FVa (9Nicolaes G.A. Sorensen K.W. Friedrich U. Tans G. Rosing J. Autin L. Dahlback B. Villoutreix B.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2724-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This latter inhibition has been suggested to contribute to the less favorable effects of APC in heparin-cotreated sepsis patients, as were studied in the PROWESS trial (18Cornet A.D. Smit E.G. Beishuizen A. Groeneveld A.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 98: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Bernard G.R. Vincent J.L. Laterre P.F. LaRosa S.P. Dhainaut J.F. Lopez-Rodriguez A.

Three-dimensional models of APC docked at the Arg306 and Arg506 cleavage sites in FVa suggest that heparin prevents optimal docking of APC at Arg506 and stimulates cleavage at Arg306 by bridging electropositive regions in FVa and APC (9Nicolaes G.A. Sorensen K.W. Friedrich U. Tans G. Rosing J. Autin L. Dahlback B. Villoutreix B.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2724-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to show that FVa residues Lys320, Arg321, and Arg400 are important for the heparin-mediated stimulation of FVa cleavage at Arg306 by APC. In addition, we observed minor but significant effects of mutations that were introduced near the Arg506 cleavage site on the APC-catalyzed FVa inactivation. The most prominent effect was observed for the FVa mutants with mutations in an acidic cluster spanning from residues 659 to 663, which is likely part of an extended FVa:APC binding interface. Reagents—Serum-free cell culture media (Opti-MEM Glu-tamax) were from Invitrogen. Hepes, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) was obtained from LEO Pharma (Ballerup, Denmark); 1 IU/ml UFH contains ∼5.7 μg/ml UFH/ml (22Fernandez J.A. Petaja J. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrates S-2238 and S-2366 were supplied by Chromogenix (Milan, Italy). Phospholipid vesicles were prepared as described (23Nicolaes G.A. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13584-13591Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Synthetic lipids used were 1,2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (DOPS) and 1,2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), and these were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Proteins—Human α-thrombin and protein S were from ERL (Swansea, UK). Hirudin was purchased from Kordia Laboratory Supplies (Leiden, The Netherlands). Bovine FX was purified according to Fujikawa et al. (24Fujikawa K. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4882-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Human FXa was prepared from FX after activation by RVV-X (24Fujikawa K. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4882-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 25Fujikawa K. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4892-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Human prothrombin was purified according to the method of Di Scipio et al. (26Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Yates S.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 3B1 directed against the heavy chain of human FV was a kind gift from Prof. B. N. Bouma. The anti-human protein C polyclonal antibodies Dako A0370 and Dako P0374 were obtained from Dako (Germany). Site-directed Mutagenesis—FV cDNA constructs containing either combined mutations at the Arg506 and Arg679 APC cleavage sites (FV R506Q/R679Q, abbreviated as RQQ) or at the Arg306 and Arg679 (FV R306Q/R679Q, abbreviated as QRQ) were prepared as described, using the pMT2-V vector as template (27Norstrom E. Thorelli E. Dahlback B. Blood. 2002; 100: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions (Tables 1 and 2) were introduced near the Arg306 or Arg506 cleavage sites by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of the expression vectors encoding the RQQ and QRQ mutants by use of the Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). For reasons of clarity, recombinant FV molecules given in Table 1 and 2 are identified only by their mutations other than the R306Q, R506Q, or R679Q that were present in the template that was used in their construction.TABLE 1Activity to antigen ratio and relative rate constants (k506) for the APC-catalyzed inactivation of FV QRQ variants by wild type APC and mutant APC (K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D) FV concentrations were determined by an ELISA and a functional assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As a parameter of specific activity, the ratio of FV activity to antigen was calculated. Values are the average of three experiments, and standard deviations were <5% for all of the FV variants. Rate constants (m–1 s–1) for inactivation of FVa variants that can only be cleaved at Arg506 by recombinant wild type APC (0.085 nm) or mutant APC (0.56 nm) were obtained by fitting time courses of inactivation to an integral time course equation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Rate constants given are means from two experiments, and standard deviations were <10% for all FVa variants. All rate constants are expressed relative to the rate constants for cleavage of R306Q/R679Q (QRQ), which were 6.25 × 107 m–1 s–1 and 4.98 × 106 m–1 s–1 for wild type and mutant APC, respectively.FV mutantFV mutationActivity/antigenWild type APC k506APC mutant k506m–1 s–1m–1 s–1QRQR306Q/R679Q0.82111D513N1.091.837.712D577N/D578N0.010.861.253D513N/D577N/D578N0.021.211.084E323Q1.250.990.785E372Q/D373N/E374Q1.190.630.886E323Q/E372Q/D373N/E374Q0.740.680.907D659N/D660N0.560.501.478D661N/E662Q/D663N0.870.521.529D659N/D660N/D661N/E662Q/D663N1.200.491.57 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Activity to antigen ratio and relative rate constants (k306) for the APC-catalyzed inactivation of FV RQQ variants FV concentrations were determined by an ELISA and a functional assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As a parameter of specific activity, the ratio of FV activity to antigen was calculated.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As a control, a pMT2-V vector, of which the FV cDNA had been excised, was used to transfect cells. Proteins were collected in serum-free medium (Optimem Glutamax) 72 h after transfection. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the media containing the recombinant proteins were concentrated ∼10-fold using Vivaspin concentrators having a molecular weight cut off of 100,000 (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). Expression levels of all FV variants were determined using an FVa activity assay, and FV antigen was determined with the FV-specific ELISA described below. FV ELISA—FV expression levels were determined by an FV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, essentially as described (29Segers K. Dahlback B. Bock P.E. Tans G. Rosing J. Nicolaes G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33915-33924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated overnight with the monoclonal antibody 3B1. The plates were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin (Hepes-buffered saline, HBS/bovine serum albumin). A standard curve was prepared using different dilutions of pooled normal citrated plasma, assuming a plasma FV concentration of 21.3 nm (30Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Bowie E.J. Mann K.G. Blood. 1982; 60: 59-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard and samples (diluted in HBS/bovine serum albumin) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and the plates were then washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in HBS. The biotinylated monoclonal antibody HV1 (0.1 μg/ml) was used as secondary antibody. After 2 h, avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Strep ABC complex/HRP from DAKO, Denmark) was added for 30 min, and plates were developed for 10 min with peroxidase substrate solution (TMB substrate kit, Pierce). The reaction was stopped, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm. To exclude the possibility that the cell culture medium interfered with the ELISA, plasma-purified FV and plasma were diluted in mock medium or in buffer. No difference was detected between these diluted samples, indicating that the cell culture medium did not interfere with the FV quantitation. FVa Assay—Expression levels of the various FV variants were also determined with a functional assay. Recombinant FV proteins were incubated with 2 nm α-thrombin for 20 min at 37 °C. FVa cofactor activity was determined by measuring the rate of FXa-catalyzed prothrombin activation as described (11Nicolaes G.A. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Typically, reaction conditions for the prothrombinase assay were as follows: 0–20 pm FVa, 5 nm FXa, 0.5 μm prothrombin, 40 μm phospholipid vesicles (10% DOPS, 90% DOPC; mol/mol), and 0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 3 mm CaCl2. Thrombin generation was allowed to continue for 2 min at 37 °C before the reaction was stopped with ice-cold EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris, 175 mm NaCl, 40 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.9). Thrombin was quantified using the chromogenic substrate S2238 (31Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molar factor Va concentration in the assay mixture was calculated as described (32Tans G. Rosing J. Thomassen M.C. Heeb M.J. Zwaal R.F. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1991; 77: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In control experiments, equal antigenic amounts of plasma-purified FVa and recombinant wild type FVa in conditioned medium or in buffer gave the same rates of prothrombin activation, indicating that conditioned medium did not interfere with FVa functional activity. Moreover, no FV(a) was detectable in the conditioned medium, as judged by both ELISA and functional activity assay. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human Protein C Variant K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D—Recombinant human protein C variant K37S/K38Q/K39Q/K62N/K63D was expressed after PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of the eukaryotic expression vector pGT-hyg (Lilly). The recombinant protein was expressed in 293 cells (CRL-1573; ATCC), purified, and activated as described (2Friedrich U. Blom A.M. Dahlback B. Villoutreix B.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24122-24128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Shen L. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein C was quantified by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm and by a chromogenic assay as described (2Friedrich U. Blom A.M. Dahlback B. Villoutreix B.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24122-24128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). APC-catalyzed Inactivation of FVa in the Absence and Presence of UFH and Protein S—Time courses of FVa inactivation by APC were determined in the absence and presence of UFH and protein S by following the loss of FXa cofactor activity of FVa in the prothrombinase complex as a function of time. To this end, 20 pm of the activated FV variants was incubated with 40 μm phospholipid vesicles (10% DOPS, 90% DOPC; mol/mol) at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 25 units/ml UFH or 150 nm protein S in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 3 mm CaCl2. Next, 3 aliquots of 115 μl were taken from the reaction mixture to determine the FVa activity in the absence of APC in triplicate. Then APC was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was subsequently separated into several 115-μl aliquots, one for each time point measured. For the QRQ and RQQ variants, final APC concentrations of 0.085 and 0.75 nm were used, respectively. At different time points after the addition of APC, the residual FVa activity was measured in the prothrombinase assay described above, with minor modifications. Prewarmed FXa (0.5 nm for the QRQ variants; 5 nm for the RQQ variants, unless otherwise indicated) and prothrombin (1 μm) were added to the FVa aliquots, and thrombin generation was allowed to continue during 2 min after which the reaction was stopped by >40-fold dilution in ice-cold EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris, 175 mm NaCl, 40 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.9). Thrombin was quantified using the chromogenic substrate S2238 (31Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We verified that the formation of thrombin was linearly dependent on the FVa concentration present in the prothrombinase mixture and that heparin (25 units/ml) did not interfere with the FVa assay. The stability of the various FVa variants was assessed by following the loss of FVa activity as a function of time in a reaction mixture to which no APC had been added. Analysis of Kinetic Data—We have previously shown that the loss of FVa cofactor activity during the APC-catalyzed inactivation of membrane-bound wild type FVa can proceed via two pathways (11Nicolaes G.A.

Alternatively, initial cleavage at Arg306 (k′306) results in complete loss of FVa cofactor activity (pathway 2, Reaction 2). For calculation of the pseudo first-order rate constant for cleavage at Arg506 in the FVa mutants, time curves obtained for the FVa QRQ variants were fit to Equation 1, Vat=Va0e-(k506+k1)t+AVa0k506e-(k2t)(k506+k1-k2)(1-e-(k506+k1-k2)t)(Eq. 1) in which Vat is the FVa cofactor activity determined at time t; Va0 is the cofactor activity before APC is added; A is the fraction of remaining procoagulant cofactor activity of the FVa variant cleaved at position 506; k506 is the observed pseudo first-order rate constant for cleavage at position 506; and k1 and k2 are the first-order rate constants of spontaneous inactivation of intact FVa and of the FVa intermediate, respectively. The value for k1 was determined by following the loss of FVa activity as a function of time in a reaction mixture that did not contain APC. The stability of the FVa intermediate (k2) was assessed in a separate experiment in which time courses of APC-catalyzed inactivation were monitored as follows. Wild type recombinant FVa was inactivated with APC, and at the beginning of the observed second slow phase, the reaction volume was divided into two portions, each transferred into a new tube. To one reaction mixture, anti-APC polyclonal antibodies were added that completely block APC-catalyzed FVa inactivation and to the other an equal volume of buffer was added. Loss of FVa was monitored in both samples, and the resulting time courses of FVa inactivation were compared and found to be superimposable. This observation further rules out the possibility that APC-mediated cleavages at alternative cleavage sites contribute to the observed loss of FVa activity. The time courses were fit to a biphasic exponential from which the value for k2 was derived. Time curves of inactivation of the FVa RQQ variants were fit to a single exponential that describes the loss of FVa cofactor activity resulting from a single cleavage at Arg306, as shown in Equation 2, Vat=Va0⋅e-(k′306+k1)⋅t(Eq. 2) in which Vat and Va0 are the FVa cofactor activities determined at time t and before APC addition, respectively; k306 is the observed pseudo first-order rate constant of cleavage at position 306, and k1 is the first-order rate constant of spontaneous inactivation of intact FVa. Expression of FV RQQ and FV QRQ Variants—Three-dimensional models of APC-heparin complexes and of APC alone docked at either the Arg306 and the Arg506 cleavage sites in FVa provided a molecular basis for the experimentally observed heparin-mediated inhibition of Arg506 cleavage and stimulation of the Arg306 cleavage in FVa by APC (9Nicolaes G.A.

On the basis of these molecular models, several charged FVa residues located near the Arg306 and Arg506 cleavage sites were identified that may play a role in the interactions between FVa, APC, and heparin. To investigate whether these FVa residues are indeed important for the recognition of the Arg306 and Arg506 cleavage sites by APC in the absence and/or presence of heparin, we have constructed a panel of FV mutants in which the charge of these surface residues was neutralized or reversed (Tables 1 and 2). To facilitate the kinetic analysis of APC-mediated cleavage at these sites, we have used FV variants that have only the Arg306 or the Arg506 cleavage site available for proteolysis by APC (see Fig. 1). After transfection of COS-1 cells, conditioned media containing the FV mutants were collected, centrifuged, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C. The activity to antigen ratio of the various FV variants was determined using a quantitative FV ELISA and a functional assay (Tables 1 and 2). Expression levels for the different recombinant FV forms, as determined by FV ELISA, were all approximately equal (∼100 p"

RNA analyses utilizing reverse transcription-PCR amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism indicated that the tagged gene was both proportionally and highly expressed and that downstream processing and/or termination were critical to U3 snoRNA stability. In contrast, direct measurements of the total cellular U3 snoRNA showed essentially normal levels of mature RNA, although measurements of precursor levels confirmed a highly expressed gene construct. Taken together, the results indicated that the steady state amounts of mature U3 snoRNA were primarily regulated at the post-transcriptional level. This regulatory mechanism prevents over-accumulation of the cellular U3 snoRNA and can efficiently degrade mutant RNA molecules. Together with past studies on other 3′ extended RNA precursors, the results support post-transcriptional regulation as a quality control mechanism in which appropriate amounts of functional RNA are stabilized by protein interaction while excess or defective RNA is rapidly degraded.

Precursor processing in vitro and mutational analyses were consistent with this model. In the eukaryotic cell, RNAs normally are synthesized as larger precursor molecules that are cleaved and often modified to form the mature and functional RNA products. Even small RNAs, such as the 5 S rRNA (1Nazar R.N. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which are not modified, are transcribed as slightly larger precursor molecules with a short sequence extension at their 3′ end; there are 12 extra nucleotides in the 5 S rRNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Because this sequence is removed by exonuclease trimming in the course of integration of the molecule into ribosomes structure (2Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6635-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), the feature seems unnecessary and wasteful. Nevertheless, mutation analyses have shown that 5 S rRNA transcripts that are not normally terminated or processed are highly unstable and not incorporated into ribosomes (3Lee Y. Melekhovets Y.F. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28003-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Such observations suggest that the regulation of the 5 S rRNA of yeast is not simply confined to the transcriptional level but also is subject to post-transcriptional regulation. These results also have led to the speculation that the precursor sequence and its removal during RNA maturation, at least in part, serve as a quality control mechanism to help ensure only functional RNA is incorporated into the nascent ribosomes (2Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6635-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Unlike the 5 S rRNA, the small nucleolar U3 RNA (U3 snoRNA) 2The abbreviations used are: snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; RT, reverse transcription; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; contig, group of overlapping clones. actually is not incorporated into ribosomes. Instead, it is integrated into an alternate nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex (4Watkins N.J. Lemm I. Ingelfinger D. Schneider C. Hossbach M. Urlaub H. Luhrmann R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which has been shown to play a critical role in rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (5Dragon F. Gallagher J.E. Compagnone-Post P.A. Mitchell B.M. Porwancher K.A. Wehner K.A. Wormsley S. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Osheim Y. Beyer A.L. Hunt D.F. Baserga S.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The complex is recruited into the 80–90 S pre-rRNA processing complex in the dense fibrillar component (6Granneman S.

Cell. 2004; 3: 1619-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) in the initial release of the 18 S rRNA (8Osheim Y.N. French S.L. Keck K.M. Champion E.A. Spasov K. Dragon F. Baserga S.J. Beyer A.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 43-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the U3 snoRNA of yeast cells is transcribed by RNA polymerase II rather than RNA polymerase III, like the 5 S rRNA, the U3 snoRNA is transcribed as a 3′ end extended precursor (9Kufel J. Allmang C. Verdone L. Beggs J. Tollervey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6788-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that termination and the maturation processes may play similar roles with respect to U3 snoRNA biogenesis. Post-transcriptional regulation generally has not been reported or even examined in respect to snoRNA biosynthesis, although the human U6 small nuclear RNA has been observed to be subject to a specific intracellular post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism (10Noonberg S.B. Scott G.K. Benz C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10477-10481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In an ongoing study of functional relationships and regulatory mechanisms for U3 snoRNA synthesis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells, we have been attempting to use an efficiently expressed plasmid-associated U3 snoRNA gene system to detect critical sequence and/or structural elements. As a step in the standardization of this expression system, in this study we examined and quantified the effect of a large change in gene dosage. The results indicate that, as observed previously with the 5 S rRNA, the amount of U3 snoRNA is strongly dependent on termination and RNA processing, with the excess amounts of mature RNA clearly being regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Strains and Vectors—Escherichia coli strain C490 (rec A-, rk-, mk-, thr-, leu-, met-) was used as a host for pTZ19R (11Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and pFL20 (12Losson R. Lacroute F. Cell. 1983; 32: 371-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) plasmid recombinants. S. pombe (h-, leu1-32, ura4-D18) cells were used as a host to express the pFL20 yeast shuttle vector recombinants. Bacterial clones were grown at 37 °C in LB-ampicillin broth or LB-ampicillin agar, and yeast transformants were grown with aeration under selective conditions in minimal medium containing 0.64% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% dextrose, 80 μg/ml leucine, 0.36 mg/ml potassium acetate, and 0.5 mg/ml potassium dihydrogen phosphate (13Gutz H. Heslot H. Leupoid U. Loprieno N. Handbook of Genetics. Plenum Press, New York1974: 395-446Google Scholar, 14Okazaki K. Okazaki N. Kume K. Jinno S. Tanaka K. Okayama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6485-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Growth rates were determined using the absorbency of cultures at 550 nm. Preparation and Expression of Tagged U3 snoRNA Genes—S. pombe genomic and plasmid DNA were extracted from logarithmically growing cells essentially as described by Hoffman and Winston (15Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). Cultures (10 ml) with absorbencies of 0.4–0.6 at 550 nm were harvested by centrifugation, washed with water, and resuspended in 200 μl of breaking buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 200 μl of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25: 24:1), and 0.3 g of acid-washed glass beads. The cells were disrupted by vortex for 3 min, and after centrifugation and ethanol precipitation, the redissolved DNA was treated with RNase A (25 ng/μl) for 30 min. Ammonium acetate (120 mm) was added, and the DNA was again precipitated with ethanol. The U3B snoRNA gene was prepared and tagged by PCR amplification using a “megaprimer” strategy (16Nabavi S. Nazar R.N. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 345: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and a cloned snU32 gene fragment template as described in Fig. 1. A single G-to-A transition mutation at nucleotide 19 initially was introduced as a neutral plasmid-derived RNA tag. Upstream (5′-GGCTGGATCCGCAAAG-3′) and downstream (5′-GAACTAATCGGATCCTACACC-3′) specific primers fused with BamHI adapter sequences were used to prepare a 0.5-kb fragment containing 69 bp of upstream and 198 bp of downstream sequence, which after digestion with BamHI endonuclease was cloned directly into the pFL20 yeast shuttle vector using its unique BamHI site. The mutant U3B snoRNA sequence was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (CBS-DNA Facility, University of Guelph), and the pFL20 recombinant was used to transform S. pombe cells using the methods of Okazaki et al. (14Okazaki K. Okazaki N. Kume K. Jinno S. Tanaka K. Okayama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6485-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To ensure a reproducible result, at least three transformants were chosen for subsequent analyses. Preparation and Analysis of Cellular U3 snoRNAs and Precursors—To assay the total cellular U3 snoRNA or precursor RNA, logarithmically growing cells were disrupted by vortex with an equal volume of glass beads (17Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 140-142Google Scholar), and cellular RNA was prepared using the protocol of Steele et al. (18Steele W.J. Okamura N. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1742-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of U3 snoRNA or pre-snoRNA were determined by RT-PCR after treatment with 0.1 unit/μl of RNase-free DNase (19Kienzle N. Young D. Zehntner S. Bushell G. Sculley T.B. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 612-616PubMed Google Scholar). The RT reactions (20 μl) were performed using 1–2 μg of DNase-treated RNA, 0.2 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 60 pmol of U3 snoRNA-specific (5′-ACACGTCAGAAAACACC-3′) or precursor-specific (5′-ATGCACATCAAGTTATAAC-3′) primer, and 40 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Fermentas Inc., Hanover, MD) incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. For PCR reactions (50 μl), 0.1–10% of the RT reaction product was used with 0.2 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 30 pmol of each primer, and 1 unit of TaqI polymerase for 30 cycles. Individual U3 snoRNA components were assayed using restriction fragment length polymorphism. Whole cell nucleic acid was extracted from logarithmically growing cultures with sodium dodecyl sulfate/phenol as described previously (18Steele W.J. Okamura N. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1742-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the U3 snoRNA was purified by fractionation on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and elution by homogenization in SDS buffer after staining with methylene blue (20Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4562-4567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). U3 cDNA was prepared from the gel-purified RNA by RT-PCR (21Sambrook J. Russell W.D. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 8.51-8.53Google Scholar) using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and primers specific for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the S. pombe U3 snoRNAs (5′-ATCGACGATACTCCATAG-3′ and 5′-ACACGTCAGAAAACACC-3′), respectively, as described above. [α-32P]dCTP (2–5 μCi) was added to the PCR reaction to label the DNA products. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), the labeled copy DNA was precipitated with ethanol and finally digested with MboI endonuclease (Invitrogen), and fragments were fractionated on 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. For quantitative analyses, images were captured using a Umax Astra 600P scanner (Umax Technologies) and quantified using Molecular Analyst PC software (Bio-Rad). In Vitro RNA Processing—A whole cell protein extract was isolated from S. pombe cells (strain h-, leu1-32, ura4-D18) for in vitro RNA processing based on the methods described by Hennighausen and Lubon (22Hennighausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and Jazwinski (23Jazwinski S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 154-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a rich medium (2% dextrose, 0.5% yeast extract) of 500 ml in total volume to an absorbency of 0.4–0.6 at 550 nm and harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. After being briefly washed twice with water, the cells were resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold breaking buffer (400 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9). An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads was added to the cell suspension, and the cells were then broken by vortexing at cold room temperature (∼8 cycles of 15 s alternating with 30 s on ice). The cell breakage was monitored by microscope; with 90% breakage, the glass beads and large cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, for 15 min at 4 °C (S10), and for the initial experiments, the resulting lysate was cleared further by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti 70 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C (S100). Higher enzymatic activities were observed in the absence of the second centrifugation step, and the abbreviated procedure was used in subsequent experiments. The protein extracts (S10 or S100) were diluted further with glycerol (20%, final concentration) and divided into 50-μl aliquots for storage at -80 °C. For in vitro processing, U3B snoRNA precursors were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (24Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15206-15212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). For templates, a T7 promoter/U3B snoRNA-specific hybrid sequence (5′-CGGAATTCCGTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGATCGACGATACTCCATAG-3′) was used as the forward primer, and a precursor-specific primer (5′-CCCTTACCTCCTCTCCTC-3′), beginning 22 nucleotides downstream of the U3B snoRNA sequence, was used as the reverse primer to prepare the template DNA by PCR amplification. The RNA transcripts were purified on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and labeled at the 5′ end using bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, after dephosphorylation with calf intestinal phosphatase (21Sambrook J. Russell W.D. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 8.51-8.53Google Scholar). The phosphatase was heat-inactivated for 10 min at 75 °C in the presence of 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) before labeling, and the labeled RNA was again purified on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. For RNA processing reactions, 30 fmol of labeled RNA (10,000 cpm) was incubated at 30 °C with 10 μl of protein extract (4.3 μg/μl) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 37.5 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm EDTA, and 30 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.4 ml of stop buffer (0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 40 mg/ml calf liver RNA as a carrier). The RNA was extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), ethanol-precipitated, ethanol-washed, and vacuum-dried. For product analyses, the samples were resuspended in 5 μl of loading buffer (formamide containing 0.03% xylene cyanol and 0.03% bromphenol blue dyes), heated for 2 min at 90 °C, and fractionated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3 m urea before being exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. For quantitative analyses, images were captured and quantified as described above. An efficiently expressed plasmid-associated tagged gene system was used to study the expression and maturation of U3 snoRNA encoded by the S. pombe snU32 locus (chromosome 2, contig pJ5566, S. pombe gene data base). As summarized in Fig. 1, the U3B snoRNA-encoding region in the S. pombe genome was PCR-amplified and cloned in the pTZ19R vector. BamHI adapter sequences and a single base substitution (G-to-A transition at nucleotide 19), which resulted in one less MboI restriction site, were introduced using a megaprimer mutagenesis strategy (16Nabavi S. Nazar R.N. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 345: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For in vivo analyses, the altered gene sequence was subcloned into a multi-copy-number yeast shuttle vector (pFL20), which subsequently was used to transform S. pombe cultures. In this case, the U3B snoRNA-encoding gene was expressed under its own promoter elements, and the MboI sequence-tagged U3B snoRNA sequence could be readily detected using restriction fragment length polymorphism after conversion to cDNA through RT-PCR amplification. As illustrated in Fig. 2, when RNA was examined from normal and transformed cells expressing the tagged gene, the mutant RNA sequence was readily detected as a distinctly migrating band during gel electrophoresis (141-bp fragment). Three independent colonies were examined for each cell type to avoid variations. As reported previously (26Selinger D.A. Porter G.L. Brennwald P.J. Wise J.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 297-308PubMed Google Scholar), in normal cells U3A snoRNA was found to make up ∼55–60% of the total U3 snoRNA population. In strong contrast, when the cells were transformed with the plasmid-associated gene, there was a dramatic change, and the tagged U3B snoRNA now made up >80% of the cellular U3 snoRNA population (lanes a–c). This strongly reflected the greatly elevated tagged gene dosage consistent with an efficient expression of the plasmid-associated sequence. The growth rate of these cells remained essentially unchanged (Table 1).TABLE 1U3 snoRNA concentration in transformed S. pombe cells expressing plasmid-associated U3 snoRNA genesConstructaConstructs as described in Fig. 1U3B* snoRNAbRelative amount of U3B* copy DNA after digestion with MboI endonuclease as described in Fig. 2U3 snoRNAcMoles of U3 snoRNA per mole of ribosome determined from the 5 S and 5.8 S rRNAs as described in Fig. 4Growth ratedGrowth rate in hours based on absorbency at 550 nmpFL2000.019 ± 0.0044.37 ± 0.15U3B*_0.577.4 ± 10.30.025 ± 0.0054.80 ± 0.12U3B*_0.5–1534.3 ± 0.70.022 ± 0.0037.43 ± 0.31a Constructs as described in Fig. 1b Relative amount of U3B* copy DNA after digestion with MboI endonuclease as described in Fig. 2c Moles of U3 snoRNA per mole of ribosome determined from the 5 S and 5.8 S rRNAs as described in Fig. 4d Growth rate in hours based on absorbency at 550 nm Open table in a new tab As noted earlier, past studies on the expression of both the 5 S rRNA genes and even rDNA have indicated that levels of the mature RNAs were strongly dependent on transcript termination and processing (3Lee Y. Melekhovets Y.F. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28003-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To evaluate this requirement in respect to U3 snoRNA biosynthesis, a truncated U3 snoRNA gene (U3B*_0.5–153) was prepared in which the last 153 nucleotides of the 198-nucleotide downstream sequence were removed. As shown in Fig. 3, when expressed in transformed S. pombe cells, the presence of the tagged gene sequence could easily be demonstrated after PCR amplification (lanes d–f), but essentially no mature tagged U3B* snoRNA was formed (lanes a–c). Clearly the termination and maturation processes are equally important for U3 snoRNA biosynthesis. In addition, unlike the tagged normal gene (U3B*_0.5), the growth rate of cells transformed with the truncated construct (U3B*_0.5–153) was significantly depressed (Table 1). Although these comparisons reflected the relative expression of the U3 snoRNA genes, they did not provide a measure of actual cellular RNA yield. Instead, a direct method was used to compare the actual amounts of U3 snoRNA in the transformed and untransformed cells. As shown in Fig. 4, when total RNA was extracted from normal (lanes a–c) and transformed (lanes d–f) cultures and fractionated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, the results were surprisingly similar, reflecting little or no change in the cellular U3 snoRNA concentration. Even when accurately expressed (Table 1) as a ratio to the ribosomal small RNAs (5.8 and 5 S rRNAs), the changes were very small, and on average the total cellular U3 snoRNA population was observed to increase by only a modest amount (Table 1). In normal cells there is about one U3 snoRNA molecule per 56 ribosomes, whereas in the transformed cells the concentration had only increased to approximately one molecule per 41 ribosomes. Despite the introduction of more than 50 copies of the gene and a clearly indicated efficient expression of the tagged RNA (Fig. 2), the cell was observed to tightly regulate the final concentration. The results presented in Fig. 4 actually raise two possibilities regarding the regulation mechanism; either it is tightly regulated at the transcription level or the access RNA is rapidly degraded at the post-transcriptional level. These possibilities were examined further when levels of both the mature and precursor U3 snoRNAs were simultaneously assessed using RT-PCR amplification. To amplify precursor molecules, we used a primer in the reverse transcription reaction, which could bind downstream of the coding region in the nascent transcripts instead of the 3′ end of the mature U3 snoRNA. Three independent colonies were again examined to eliminate variations. As shown in Fig. 5, left panel, the overall levels of the mature U3 snoRNA remain virtually unchanged between the wild-type cells (lanes a–c) and the transformants (lanes d–f), as observed in the direct analyses (e.g. Fig. 4) using acrylamide gels. However, in contrast, the level of precursor was very different, with at least an 11-fold increase in the transformed cells (middle panel). Equally, when competitive RT-PCR was applied to normal or transformed cells to ensure a quantitative assay, the results were again striking. As also shown in Fig. 5 (right panel), in competition with mature RNA, the level of precursor was too low to be detectable in transformed cells (lane a), but it was very evident in cells expressing multiple copies of plasmid-associated genes (lane d). Clearly, the U3 snoRNA is very substantially overproduced in the transformed cells but is unstable and rapidly degraded at the post-transcriptional level, resulting in unchanged steady state levels of mature U3 snoRNA. In past studies on the 5 S rRNA (2Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6635-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), maturation at the 3′ end of the precursor molecules could be readily demonstrated in vitro with the binding of cellular protein limiting the extent of trimming. Studies on the U3 snoRNA in S. cerevisiae as well as several snRNAs have demonstrated that similar precursor intermediates are formed by endonuclease cleavage (e.g. Refs. 9Kufel J. Allmang C. Verdone L. Beggs J. Tollervey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6788-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and 27Abou Elela S.

Frendewey D. Lobo Ruppert S.M. RNA. 1999; 8: 1083-1098Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Indeed, as observed in S. cerevisiae, studies with the Pac1 RNase III-like endonuclease in S. pombe indicate that a 3′ end hairpin structure, which follows the mature snoRNA sequence, is efficiently cut at nucleotide C+22 (31Nazar R.N. Nabavi S. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 811.8Google Scholar). To examine RNA trimming in S. pombe cells, U3B snoRNA precursor with the 22 additional nucleotides at the 3′ end was prepared using T7 RNA polymerase. As indicated in Fig. 6, when this precursor was incubated with a crude cell protein extract (S100), the results were entirely reminiscent of those observed with the 5 S rRNA (2Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6635-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The extra nucleotides were clearly trimmed away while the extent of trimming was dramatically limited to form the mature RNA. In the case of the 5 S rRNA and some snoRNAs, past studies also showed that mutations at known protein binding sites close to the termini had striking effects on the processing and/or stability of precursor transcripts (2Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6635-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 32Samarsky D.A. Fournier M.J. Mol. Cell.

As shown in Fig. 7, upper panel, to further evaluate the general nature of this observation, a 4-nucleotide insertion was made near the 3′ end of the MboI-tagged S. pombe U3B snoRNA gene, and RNA production was examined in vivo. As also shown in Fig. 7, left panel, although the gene itself was easily detected by PCR (lanes a–c), little or no plasmid-derived mature RNA was observed using RT-PCR and the same U3 snoRNA-specific primers (lanes d–f). This was equally true when the steady state level was assessed as illustrated in Fig. 4 (right panel). In strong contrast, when precursor levels were determined by competitive RT-PCR, simultaneously using precursor- and mature RNA-specific primers (right panel), the elevated level of precursor was easily detected (U3B*). Clearly the transcript was now highly unstable and readily degraded as reported previously with the 5 S rRNA. In view of the similarities with studies on the 5 S rRNA, the maturation of the mutant transcript also was examined, in vitro, as illustrated in Fig. 6 (right panels). Because U3 snoRNA processing in S. cerevisiae has been linked to the exosome, a large protein complex of exoribonuclease activities (28Allmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1999; 19: 5399-5410Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar), extracts containing higher molecular components (S10) were also examined. Indeed, this alternative extract was more efficient, and as shown in Fig. 6, essentially complete maturation was now observed after 2 h of incubation (middle panel). In sharp contrast, the results with the mutant precursor RNA were very different. Much less mature RNA was produced, and by 10 h much of the mature RNA or precursor was degraded with little of either remaining. The results were fully consistent with the observations in vivo (Fig. 7) and again underline the significance of the 3′ end sequence/structure with respect to RNA processing and stability. As noted above, past studies on 5 S rRNA have shown that termination and processing are critical to rRNA stability and utilization (3Lee Y. Melekhovets Y.F. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28003-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Early protein interactions limit the extent of 3′ end processing and protect the nascent RNA from random degradation. This represents a post-transcriptional mechanism that both prevents excess steady state levels of the RNA and perhaps a quality control mechanism that helps assure that only functional RNA is integrated into ribosomes (2Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6635-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In contrast, limited past studies on other small nuclear or nucleolar RNAs such as the U-rich spliceosomal snRNAs generally have not reported such mechanisms. Only the U1 snRNA of mouse cells (34Mangin M. Ares Jr., M. Weiner A.M. Science. 1985; 229: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the U6 snRNA of a human cell line (10Noonberg S.B. Scott G.K. Benz C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10477-10481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have been shown to be subject to any gene dosage compensation, and even then, post-transcriptional regulation has only been demonstrated in the human system. Other U3 snoRNAs have been expressed in vivo (e.g. Refs. 9Kufel J. Allmang C. Verdone L. Beggs J. Tollervey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6788-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and 35Leader D.J. Connelly S. Filipowicz W. Brown J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but the possibility of gene compensation appears not to have been examined. The present study shows that like the rRNAs, excess U3 snoRNA is effectively regulated at the post-transcriptional level, and precursor processing again appears to act as a quality control mechanism. The level of expression as established by precursor level measurements largely reflected the gene dosage indicating little or no control at the transcription level. Despite these far higher levels of U3 snoRNA transcription (see Fig. 5), the cellular levels of mature RNA remained essentially constant (see Fig. 4). Furthermore, when the 3′ end sequence was modified (see Fig. 7), all of the mutant RNA was completely or almost completely eliminated. As reported previously for the pre-rRNA (1Nazar R.N. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the 5 S rRNA (2Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6635-6641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), this basically represents a quality control mechanism that helps assure that only functional RNA is incorporated into ribonucleoprotein and subsequently utilized in cellular function. Accordingly, it is attractive to speculate that, as illustrated by the present examples, many other 3′ end extended RNAs similarly may be subject to such post-transcriptional quality and level control. Searches for further examples of what appears to be an important general regulatory approach are warranted. Although the mechanism underlying the targeted degradation is unclear, it is likely to be connected to saturable protein(s) that specifically bind to the nascent RNA and protect the transcript from housekeeping nucleases. In the case of 5 S rRNA, a specific ribosomal protein, YL3 in yeast, has been identified and shown to essentially “cap” the termini (24Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15206-15212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although structural analyses (32Samarsky D.A. Fournier M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3431-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indicate that the 5′ and 3′ ends of the U3 snoRNA do not interact to form a terminal helix, which might limit the enzymatic trimming, clearly a simple cellular protein extract provides both trimming activity and factors that can limit it at the mature 3′ end (Fig. 6). As observed previously with the 5 S rRNA, mutations at known protein binding sites close to the termini of snoRNAs also have been reported to impair the processing of precursor transcripts (32Samarsky D.A. Fournier M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3431-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33Watkins N.J. Leverette R.D. Xia L. Andrews M.T. Maxwell E.S. RNA. 1996; 2: 118-133PubMed Google Scholar), but again, proteins that actually stabilize the RNAs are not known. In the present study, a mutation in the 3′ end of the S. pombe U3 snoRNA clearly had a comparable effect, both in vivo and in vitro (Figs. 6 and 7), further underlining similarities in the RNAs with 3′ end extended precursors. Depletion of U3 snoRNA-specific binding proteins in S. cerevisiae appear not to affect U3 snoRNA levels (7Bernstein K.A. Gallagher J.E. Mitchell B.M. Granneman S. Baserga S.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 1619-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Dragon F. Gallagher J.E. Compagnone-Post P.A. Mitchell B.M. Porwancher K.A. Wehner K.A. Wormsley S. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5441-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but because the proteins were depleted individually, and the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein has been reported to contain many protein constituents, it is possible that stability is actually maintained by multiple protein interactions. Alternatively, the critical protein simply may not have been identified. Whatever the case, the present study illustrates a more general application for the previous observations with rRNAs. The expression system described in this study remains as an attractive vehicle for further studies on the contributing protein factors, including their roles in non-polyadenylated polymerase II termination and precursor processing."

However, this overlooks the importance of repeated infections in maintaining efficient immune defenses. When acquired immunity has partly waned, re-exposure to the pathogenic agent may lead to mild disease that boosts the immune system. This prevents the total loss of immunity that would lead to classical disease in cases of re-infection. Here, using a mathematical model, we show that avoiding the pathogenic agent is detrimental in some situations, e.g. for pathogens that are highly transmissible, are not excessively lethal and that induce rapidly waning immunity. Reducing exposure to pathogenic agents is among the objectives of most, if not all, public health measures. A better understanding of the factors influencing the severity of a disease is required before applying measures that reduce the circulation of pathogenic agents."
