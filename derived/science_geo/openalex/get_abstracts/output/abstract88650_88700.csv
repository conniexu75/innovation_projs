https://openalex.org/W1990367849,"We have produced 13 strains of transgenic mice that carry an otherwise normal mouse myc gene in which increasingly larger portions of the myc promoter region have been replaced by a hormonally inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Although expression of the fusion genes varies among these animals, the female founders of two of these transgenic strains spontaneously developed mammary adenocarcinomas during one of their early pregnancies. Both the tumors and the breast tissue of these founder animals expressed RNA transcripts corresponding to the fusion gene. Furthermore, in the best studied strain, all the available F1 female progeny that inherited the MTV/myc gene also developed mammary adenocarcinomas during their second or third pregnancies. Thus, although it has no obvious effect on the early development of these mice, the constitutionally deregulated myc gene appears to act as a heritable, predisposing factor favoring the accelerated development of a tissue-specific adenocarcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W1974988689,"In a previous study, a mutant of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase in which a threonine residue (Thr51) was converted to proline dramatically improved the affinity of the enzyme for its ATP substrate. How does Pro51 improve the enzyme's affinity for ATP? A priori, Pro51 might interact directly with the ATP, or it might distort the polypeptide backbone and thereby force new or improved contacts elsewhere from the enzyme to ATP. By making mutants of the Pro51 enzyme at two residues that make hydrogen bonds to the ATP substrate, we show that Pro51 greatly improves the strength of one of these contacts. Thus the propagation of a structural change in an enzyme induced by mutation may be detected by the introduction of further mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2057393088,"The role of heart rate in the development of coronary atherosclerosis was assessed in adult male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Heart rate was lowered in six animals by surgical ablation of the sinoatrial node. A sham procedure, which included all of the surgical steps except for sinoatrial node ablation, was carried out in eight animals. All of the monkeys were fed an atherogenic high cholesterol diet for 6 months, and heart rates were monitored repeatedly by telemetry during 24-hour test periods. Coronary atherosclerosis in animals with postoperative heart rates less than the preoperative mean for all of the animals that underwent surgery was less than half that of animals with heart rates above the mean or of diet-fed control animals not subjected to surgery. Groups did not differ in blood pressure, serum lipids, or body weight. These results suggest that heart rate in itself may contribute to the mechanisms by which behavioral patterns and physical training influence coronary artery disease."
https://openalex.org/W1531766605,"Oligosaccharides with different affinities for antithrombin were isolated following partial deaminative cleavage of pig mucosal heparin with nitrous acid. The smallest high-affinity component obtained was previously identified as an octasaccharide with the predominant structure: (Formula: see text). The interaction of this octasaccharide, and of deca- and dodecasaccharides containing the same octasaccharide sequence, with antithrombin was studied by spectroscopic techniques. The near-ultraviolet difference spectra, circular dichroism spectra, and fluorescence enhancements induced by adding these oligosaccharides to antithrombin differed only slightly from the corresponding parameters measured in the presence of undegraded high-affinity heparin. Moreover, the binding constants obtained for the oligosaccharides and for high-affinity heparin were similar (1.0-2.9 X 10(7) M-1 at I = 0.3). In contrast, two hexasaccharides corresponding to units 1-6 and 3-8, respectively, of the above sequence showed about a 1000-fold lower affinity for antithrombin, and also induced considerably different spectral perturbations in antithrombin. Since the 1-6 hexasaccharide contains a reducing-terminal anhydromannose residue instead of the N-sulfated glucosamine unit 6 of the intact sequence, these results strongly support our previous conclusion that the N-sulfate group at position 6 is essential to the interaction with antithrombin. The low affinity of the hexasaccharide 3-8 provides further evidence that a pentasaccharide sequence 2-6 constitutes the actual antithrombin-binding region in the heparin molecule. Structural analysis of the various oligosaccharides revealed natural variants with an N-sulfate group substituted for the N-acetyl group at position 2. The preponderance of N-acetyl over N-sulfate groups at this position may be rationalized in terms of the mechanism of heparin biosynthesis, assuming that the D-gluco configuration of unit 3 is an essential feature of the antithrombin-binding region."

https://openalex.org/W1509346516,"Support for the role of a cytosolic oxysterol-binding protein in the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase was obtained by correlating the relative binding affinities of a wide range of oxysterols to their potency in suppressing HMG-CoA reductase activity in mouse fibroblast cell cultures. Forty-seven oxysterols encompassing a 100-fold range of activity in both assays were tested and the two parameters were closely correlated for 35 of the sterols. Twelve sterols showed poor binding when compared to their ability to suppress HMG-CoA reductase activity in cell cultures. Among these were seven sterols with a ketone function at C-3. For this group, the discrepancy could be explained by their rapid conversion within cells to the 3 beta-hydroxy derivatives which have a much higher affinity for the binding protein. One sterol with 3-keto-4-ene grouping was not reduced to its 3 beta-hydroxy derivative in cells and thereby showed no discrepancy in the two assays. The remaining five sterols exhibiting discordant activities in the two tests contained 4,4-dimethyl moieties and were relatively weak suppressors of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Cellular metabolism of these sterols was not detected. Possible reasons for their apparent inactivity in the binding assay are discussed."

The enzymatic reaction obeyed Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics with respect to varying concentrations of leukotriene A4. An apparent KM value ranging between 20 and 30 microM was deduced from Eadie-Hofstee plots. Physical properties including molecular weight (68,000-70,000), amino acid composition, and aminoterminal sequence were determined. It was indicated that leukotriene A4 hydrolase is a monomeric protein, distinct from previously described epoxide hydrolases in liver."

https://openalex.org/W2029461950,We have studied chromosome rearrangements in T. brucei using pulsed field gradient gel electrophoresis to separate chromosome-sized DNA molecules. We detect size changes in a set of small chromosomes (200–700 kb) at a frequency of 10−5 to 10−6 per trypanosome division; this results in a radical difference in the size distribution of these chromosomes in different T. brucei isolates. Several of these chromosome rearrangements can be related to a change in the expression of surface antigen genes. Such rearrangements may be undetectable by standard gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis because the DNA segment transferred is too large to detect the breakpoint with the antigen gene probe. We also provide additional evidence for the notion that transcription of protein-coding genes in T. brucei and related flagellates is discontinuous. The possibility that gene rearrangements are essential for all changes in variant surface gene expression remains open.

https://openalex.org/W1569276332,"Cloning and sequence analysis of the alpha-globin genes from a Sardinian patient with the nondeletion type of hemoglobin-H disease revealed a new type of thalassemia lesion. A mutation in the alpha 2-globin gene changes the initiation codon ATG to ACG and abolishes the function of this gene. Globin mRNA output from the affected alpha 2 locus is decreased relative to the alpha 1 locus. The mutation is detectable in genomic DNA by restriction analysis with the enzyme NcoI. Of the seven Sardinian patients with nondeletion alpha thalassemia screened with this enzyme, six had the initiation codon lesion."
https://openalex.org/W2082304865,"Cloned cDNA probes that recognize muscle-specific α-actin gene transcripts have been used to analyze two kinds of experimental embryos in Xenopus. In one, genetically marked nuclei of larval muscle cells were transplanted to wild-type enucleated eggs; α-actin genes became transcriptionally inactive in the resulting blastulae but were reactivated when these embryos reached the normal stage of α-actin expression (late gastrula). In the other, blastula embryos reared from fertilized eggs were separated into animal, vegetal, and equatorial regions, and their cells dissociated and reaggregated. α-Actin RNA was synthesized at the normal time in development, but only by equatorial cells. We conclude that α-actin gene transcription is normally regulated in nuclear-transplant embryos and is undisturbed by the absence of cell contacts during cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1552287296,"Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FABMS) has been used to determine the structure of the urinary sleep-promoting factor (FSu), the nature of whose components had been reported earlier. Less than 1 nmol of the underivatized substance sufficed for the FABMS experiments. The major somnogenic constituent of the purified preparation was a peptidoglycan of Mr = 921 with the structure N-acetylglucosaminyl-N -acetylanhydromuramylalanylglutamyldiaminopimelylalanine. The anhydro linkage is between C-1 and C-6 of the muramyl entity. Two additional substances accompanied the above compound. These were the hydrated form (i.e. in which the muramyl entity had a free reducing end, and a free hydroxyl on C-6), and an anhydro analogue lacking the terminal alanine. The Mr values were 939 and 850, respectively. Methyl esters were prepared, and these were also acetylated. The mass spectra of the methyl ester of Mr = 921 displayed an increase in Mr of 42 (i.e. 3 X 14), indicating the presence, originally, of three free carboxyls. Acetylation increased Mr by a further 168 units (i.e. 4 X 42), indicating 4 hydroxyl or amino groups. These data are consistent with the structure cited above for the main entity of FSu. Similar confirmatory results were obtained for the two minor constituents described above. These operations were worked out on natural muramyl peptides of known structure, obtained from other sources, and the data are given for comparison."
https://openalex.org/W2062499673,"We have investigated the molecular basis of muscle abnormalities in the flightless Drosophila mutant lfm(3)7. This EMS-induced, semi-dominant allele was isolated by Mogami and Hotta (1981) and was shown to disrupt the organization of myofibrils in indirect flight muscles. Here we demonstrate that lfm(3)7 contains a nonsense mutation within codon 355 of the act88F actin gene. A single G greater than A transition converts a tryptophan (TGG) codon to an opal (TGA) terminator, thus deleting the carboxy-terminal 20 amino acids of an actin isoform that accumulates only in thoracic flight muscles. The truncated actin polypeptide is stable, and retains antigenicity to at least two anti-Drosophila actin monoclonal antibodies. We suggest that abnormalities in lfm(3)7 flight muscles result from incorporation of the mutant actin isoform into assembling myofibrils."
https://openalex.org/W1605270049,"The free sulfhydryl groups of purified plasma fibronectin were blocked by alkylation with iodoacetamide in 3 M guanidine hydrochloride at pH 7.0 (to form fCam-fibronectin). 125I-fCam-fibronectin bound to cell layers of cultured human fibroblasts with kinetics similar to binding of 125I-labeled underivatized fibronectin. Once bound to the cell surface, 125I-fCam-fibronectin, like 125I-fibronectin, became incorporated into a detergent-insoluble extracellular matrix. Matrix-bound 125I-fCam-fibronectin, like matrix-bound 125I-fibronectin, was present as disulfide-bonded multimers as well as disulfide-bonded dimers. These results indicate that the mechanism of formation of disulfide-bonded fibronectin multimers does not involve oxidation of free sulfhydryls. Catheptic D digests of matrix-bound fibronectin were analyzed by gel electrophoresis without and with reduction. In non-reduced digests, the disulfide-rich 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment was found in a large (greater than 300 kDa) complex. Thus, fibronectin multimer formation probably occurs by disulfide exchange in the amino-terminal portion of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1499261211,"A specific antiserum to rat liver spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase was used to study the induction of this protein. The antiserum had no effect on the spermidine acetylating capacity of crude nuclear extracts and very little effect on the activity present in crude cytosolic extracts from control rat tissues indicating that most of this activity is not due to spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase. Treatment of rats with carbon tetrachloride, spermidine, thioacetamide, or methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) produced a substantial increase in the spermidine acetylating capacity of rat liver cytosolic extracts which was exclusively due to an increase in the immunoprecipitable spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase protein. Exact measurement of the extent of this increase was not possible because the basal amount was too low to determine precisely but the amount of this enzyme increased about 250-fold with 6 h of treatment with carbon tetrachloride, about 25-fold at 6 h after spermidine, about 23-fold at 24 h after thioacetamide and up to 300-fold at 24 h after methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone). Treatment of rats with spermidine also increased spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase in other tissues including lung, kidney, and pancreas. The spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase protein was found to turn over very rapidly with a half-life of about 15 min in thioacetamide-treated rats and 180 min after carbon tetrachloride."
https://openalex.org/W1501599308,"Unstimulated platelets maintain a low cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and a steep plasma membrane Ca2+ gradient. The mechanisms that are required have not been completely defined. In the present studies, 45Ca2+ was used to examine the kinetics of Ca2+ exchange in intact unstimulated platelets. Quin2 was used to measure the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. Under steady-state conditions, the maximum rate of Ca2+ exchange across the platelet plasma membrane, 2 pmol/10(8) platelets/min, was observed at extracellular free Ca2+ concentrations 20-fold less than in plasma. Two intracellular exchangeable Ca2+ pools were identified. The size of the more rapidly exchanging pool (t 1/2, 17 min) and the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration were relatively unaffected by large changes in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. In contrast, the size of the more slowly exchanging Ca2+ pool (t 1/2, 300 min) varied with the extracellular Ca2+ concentration, which suggests that it is physically as well as kinetically distinct from the rapidly exchangeable Ca2+ pool. The locations of the Ca2+ pools were determined by differential permeabilization of 45Ca2+-loaded platelets with digitonin. 45Ca2+ in the rapidly exchanging pool was released with lactate dehydrogenase, which suggests that it is located in the cytosol. 45Ca2+ in the slowly exchanging pool was released with markers for both the dense tubular system and mitochondria, but inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone had no effect on the size of the slowly exchangeable Ca2+ pool or the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. In contrast, addition of metabolic inhibitors (KCN plus carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone plus deoxyglucose) or trifluoperazine caused a decrease in the size of the slowly exchangeable Ca2+ pool and an increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. These observations suggest that Ca2+ homeostasis in unstimulated platelets is maintained by limiting Ca2+ influx from plasma, actively promoting Ca2+ efflux, and sequestering Ca2+ within an internal site, which is most likely the dense tubular system and not mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1565388437,"The entry of diphtheria toxin into model membranes was studied using a membrane-restricted photoprobe to monitor insertion. The results provided direct evidence that the A and B domains of diphtheria toxin can both insert into such membranes. Optimal binding was achieved with negatively charged liposomes at pH 3.6. Under these conditions, the A and B domains of nicked as well as unnicked toxin inserted. At 0 degrees C, only fragment B inserted although toxin was still optimally bound. At neutral pH, there was little binding of toxin, and fragment B inserted preferentially. Brief exposure of the toxin to pH 3.6 followed by adjustment of the pH to 7 and subsequent incubation of the toxin with vesicles at neutral pH greatly facilitated toxin binding as well as insertion of both A and B domains, indicating also that a pH gradient was not required for these processes. Data obtained from the tryptic fragmentation patterns and circular dichroism spectra indicated that exposure to acidic pH had induced a conformational change in the toxin which may have exposed hydrophobic regions. A similar conformational change may occur in vivo after acidification of cytoplasmic vesicles into which toxin is delivered by receptor-mediated endocytosis. This could facilitate insertion of toxin into the vesicle membranes and subsequent translocation of fragment A to the cytosol, where it causes inhibition of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1563711875,"We have developed an immunological method for isolation and identification of DNA sequences containing 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporated during UV-induced excision-repair synthesis. DNA fragments containing BrdUrd incorporated during repair synthesis were incubated with goat anti-BrdUrd and rabbit anti-goat IgG, and the antibody-DNA complexes were separated from bulk DNA by nitrocellulose filter binding. With this method, 80% of DNA sequences containing BrdUrd-labeled excision-repair sites were recovered, contaminated with less than 1% of DNA fragments devoid of excision-repair sites. Recovery of DNA fragments containing repair sites was independent of size from 2 to 20 kilobases. We have used this method in conjunction with blot hybridization to demonstrate that repair synthesis occurs in human ribosomal gene sequences in cells treated with UV."
https://openalex.org/W2111581897,"Glucocorticoid treatment of fibroblasts from late gestation fetal bovine ligamentum nuchae resulted in a time- and dose-dependent selective increase in elastin production. Tropoelastin levels increased 2-3-fold in the presence of 10 nM dexamethasone while total protein synthesis and the rate of cell division decreased with glucocorticoid exposure. Two tropoelastin bands of molecular weights 64,500 and 61,000 were identified by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate gradient-gel electrophoresis and both bands increased to an equal extent in the presence of dexamethasone. Undifferentiated cells from early-gestation animals did not synthesize elastin after hormone exposure, even though glucocorticoid receptors were demonstrated by nuclear-translocation experiments. These results indicate that glucocorticoids stimulate elastin production in elastin-producing ligament cells but do not induce elastin synthesis (differentiation) in undifferentiated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1515757873,"Preparations of bovine and human coagulation Factor V were analyzed for copper using both atomic absorption and atomic emission spectroscopy. All preparations of the bovine and human protein were found to contain copper ion at a ratio of 1 copper ion bound per mol (Mr = 330,000) of Factor V. As a result of copper binding and sequence homology between ceruloplasmin and Factor V, bovine Factor V and thrombin-activated Factor V (Va) were assessed with respect to their visible and near ultraviolet absorption spectra and to their ability to oxidize N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (a substrate for ceruloplasmin). Factor V and Factor Va exhibited absorption spectra with no maxima at either 310 or 610 nm, indicating that the copper is not bound in a site analogous to Type I or Type III copper sites in ceruloplasmin. Further, Factor V and Factor Va are not capable of serving as catalysts for the oxidation of N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine under solution conditions that are optimum for ceruloplasmin oxidase activity. These data suggest that the copper ion bound to Factor V may be functionally and structurally distinct from the Type I and Type III copper ion bound to ceruloplasmin."
https://openalex.org/W166640503,"Abstract Platelets maintain a low cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration by limiting Ca2+ influx from plasma and promoting Ca2+ efflux. The present studies examine the role of the plasma membrane Na+ gradient in these processes. The Na+ gradient in intact unstimulated platelets was altered by incubating the platelets with ouabain or by replacing extracellular Na+ with N-methyl-D-glucamine or choline. Ca2+ flux across the plasma membrane and the amount of exchangeable Ca2+ in the platelet cytosol were measured by observing 45Ca2+ influx and efflux under steady-state conditions. The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was measured with the fluorescent probe quin2. At extracellular Na+ concentrations below 50 mM, the size of the cytosolic exchangeable Ca2+ pool increased by 48%. The size of the exchangeable Ca2+ pool sequestered in the dense tubular system increased by 356%. Ca2+ flux across the plasma membrane increased by 38%. There was, however, no change in total platelet Ca2+ and little, if any, change in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. Similar effects were produced by incubating platelets with ouabain. These observations demonstrate a marked influence of the plasma membrane Na+ gradient on Ca2+ homeostasis in platelets. The nature of the changes, however, suggests that Na+/Ca2+ exchange cannot be sole basis for Ca2+ efflux from platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1595402887,"Oxygen release by human erythrocytes in the presence of external sodium dithionite was examined by stopped-flow, rapid mixing techniques. The resultant time courses were analyzed quantitatively using a three-dimensional disc model which had been developed previously to describe oxygen uptake (Vandegriff, K. D., and Olson, J. S. (1984) Biophys. J. 45, 825-835). This scheme takes into account diffusion of oxygen through external unstirred solvent layers and intracellular oxygen diffusion and chemical reaction with hemoglobin. Application of this model to deoxygenation time courses required three additional considerations: the reaction of free oxygen with external sodium dithionite, cooperative oxygen binding to intracellular hemoglobin, and the alkaline Bohr effect. The resultant theoretical treatment described accurately both the observed dependence of the deoxygenation rate on dithionite concentration and pH and the exact shapes of the corresponding time courses. Membrane resistance to oxygen diffusion was not required to simulate the observed data as had been suggested previously (Lawson, W. H., Jr., Holland, R. A. B., and Forster, R. E. (1965). J. Appl. Physiol. 20, 912-918). The final, three-dimensional model is general and allows, for the first time, analysis of both oxygen uptake and release kinetics (Vandegriff, K. D., and Olson, J. S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12619-12627)."

https://openalex.org/W1606882920,"Halorhodopsin is a retinal-containing pigment that is thought to function as a light-driven chloride ion pump in the cell membrane of Halobacterium halobium. To address the role of the retinal chromophore in chloride ion transport, resonance Raman spectra have been obtained of the hR578 form of chromatographically purified halorhodopsin (hR). The close similarity of the frequencies and intensities of the hR578 Raman bands with those of light-adapted bacteriorhodopsin (bR568) shows that the chromophore in hR578 has an all-trans configuration and that the protein environment around the chromophore in these two pigments is very similar. In addition, hR578 exhibits a Raman line at 1633 cm-1 which is assigned as the stretching vibration of a protonated Schiff base linkage to the protein based on its shift to 1627 cm-1 in D2O. The reduced frequency of the Schiff base stretching vibration compared with bR568 (1640 cm-1) is shown to result from a reduction of its coupling with the NH in-plane rock. This may be due to a reduction in hydrogen-bonding between the Schiff base proton and an electronegative counterion in halorhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W1509111291,"Monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunopurification procedures were used to probe the immunochemical relatedness of cytochromes P-450 in tissues from different species. RIAs based on MAb 1-7-1 and MAb 1-31-2, both to the major 3-methylcholanthrene (MC)-induced rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450, detected antigenically related forms of cytochrome P-450 in liver microsomes from MC-induced rats, C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs, and in lung and kidney microsomes of MC-induced rats. Individual cytochromes P-450 were also isolated from these microsomes by MAb-directed immunopurification. When bound to Sepharose, MAb 1-7-1 adsorbed two species of Mr 56,000 and 57,000 from liver microsomes from rats and C57BL/6 mice, while MAb 1-31-2 adsorbed only the Mr 57,000 polypeptide. These results reveal that livers from both rats and C57BL/6 mice contain a cytochrome P-450 (Mr 56,000) with the epitope for 1-7-1 and a cytochrome P-450 (Mr 57,000) with epitopes for both 1-31-2 and 1-7-1. Additional immunochemical relatedness between the cytochromes P-450 in different tissues was demonstrated by MAb-directed immunopurification of cytochromes P-450 from DBA/2 mouse liver (Mr 56,000), guinea pig liver (Mr 53,000), hamster liver (Mr 57,000), and rat lung (Mr 57,000). These results demonstrate the efficacy of MAb-based RIA and immunopurification procedures for simple and rapid detection and purification of cytochromes P-450 from a variety of tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1606154609,"Proteoglycans, a major component of the extracellular matrix, are produced in many tissues. A report from this laboratory describes the proteoglycans synthesized in culture by chick embryonic skeletal muscle myotubes. To extend this study to in vivo conditions, chick embryos were radiolabeled in ovo and the newly synthesized high-buoyant-density proteoglycans from skeletal muscle analyzed. In both leg muscle and pectoral muscle, three major high-density proteoglycans are synthesized. One is small and is similar to the proteoglycans synthesized in culture by muscle fibroblasts. The other two proteoglycans are large. The larger of these shares structural features with the proteoglycan synthesized by skeletal muscle cells in culture. It has large chondroitin sulfate chains (estimated molecular weight of 70,000) with a high proportion of chondroitin 6-sulfate (approximately 90%). The smaller of the two large proteoglycans is distinct (chondroitin sulfate of estimated molecular weight 24,000 and approximately 60% 6-sulfated disaccharides) and is not detected in muscle cultures; evidence suggests it is not made by myoblasts. Whole hearts synthesize proteoglycans with some structural similarities, and also differences, to those made in skeletal muscle. These data indicate that the proteoglycans synthesized in muscle cultures are likewise made in developing muscle in ovo but that another distinct strictly in ovo proteoglycan is also produced."
https://openalex.org/W1482504077,"Two rapid and high yield purification methods for the rat liver glucocorticoid receptor based on differential DNA affinity (method A) and ligand affinity (method B) chromatography are described. In method A, the amount of receptor in rat liver cytosol that can be activated and subsequently eluted from a DNA-cellulose column has been increased to 80% by introducing a second heat activation step. Using this method, 1.5 nmol of 25% pure glucocorticoid receptor can be routinely obtained per day from 15-20 rat livers. Method B yields about 2.2 nmol of 60% pure receptor with an overall yield of congruent to 60%. The quality of these purifications has been controlled by affinity labeling. In each case, more than 95% of purified binding activity represented the intact 92,000 +/- 400-Da glucocorticoid receptor polypeptide as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and fluorography. No difference in the labeling pattern was observed using either [3H]triamcinolone acetonide (photoaffinity labeling) or [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate (electrophilic labeling). The electrophilic labeling step was performed in the cytosol prior to purification by method A to compare the labeled components thus purified with those obtained when the photoaffinity labeling was performed after the purification. Using this approach, distinct breakdown products of the glucocorticoid receptor were revealed, co-purifying during DNA affinity chromatography. Cross-linked receptor obtained by method A has been further purified to homogeneity by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and successfully used as immunogen to raise glucocorticoid receptor antibodies in rabbits. These antibodies raised against glucocorticoid receptor, as well as those previously obtained using affinity chromatography-purified receptor, react with the receptor molecules irrespective of their method of purification. Glucocorticoid receptors purified by methods A and B have been analyzed for specific DNA-binding properties by the nitrocellulose filter binding assay."
https://openalex.org/W1525734679,"Abstract Using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter, we have isolated a population of variant mouse hepatoma cells which have a markedly increased ability to metabolize benzo(a)pyrene. Compared with wild-type (Hepa 1c1c7) cells, the variant cells exhibit increased aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity and increased responsiveness of the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction mechanism to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Cell fusion experiments indicate that the variant phenotype is co-dominant with respect to wild-type. Filter hybridization analyses indicate that increased accumulation of cytochrome P1-450-specific mRNA accounts for the overproduction of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity. Measurements of RNA synthesis in isolated nuclei reveal that the variants exhibit an increased rate of transcription of the cytochrome P1-450 gene in response to TCDD. The variant cells contain no detectable alteration in their TCDD receptors, nor is the cytochrome P1-450 gene amplified in the variants. Filter hybridization analyses of restriction endonuclease-digested DNA indicate that the variant cytochrome P1-450 gene is relatively undermethylated, compared with the wild-type gene. We conclude that the variant cells contain an altered cis-acting genomic element(s) which regulates the expression of the cytochrome P1-450 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1542022309,"In an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism of the rat muscle adenylosuccinate synthetase reaction, experiments using the technique of positional isotope exchange (isotope scrambling) were undertaken. [gamma-18O]GTP was prepared and incubated with Mg2+ and the synthetase in the presence of various ligands. Positional isotope exchange occurred, as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, when IMP was present. In the absence of IMP, with or without aspartate or succinate, the [gamma-18O]GTP did not exhibit scrambling. These results suggest that the adenylosuccinate synthetase reaction involves the participation of 6-phosphoryl-IMP as an obligatory intermediate. On the basis of experiments carried out in our laboratory as well as in others, we believe the GDP remains bound to the enzyme until the product, adenylosuccinate, is formed. All products may then dissociate randomly from the enzyme. The positional isotope exchange experiments, along with initial-rate experiments carried out in our laboratory, serve to explain the lack of partial exchange reactions associated with the synthetase (Fromm, H. J. (1958) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 29, 255-262), as well as the net inversion of configuration when chiral thio-GTP is converted to thiophosphate (Webb, M. R., Reed, G. H., Cooper, B. F., and Rudolph, F. B. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3044-3046)."
https://openalex.org/W1509019340,"Based upon measurements of the sedimentation coefficient and the Stokes radii, three forms of the oxysterol-binding protein were identified. The unliganded binding protein was the largest (7.7 S, Stokes radius = 71.6 A, Mr = 236,000) was relatively asymmetric (f/f0 = 1.7), and was composed of at least three subunits. Binding of 25-hydroxycholesterol was associated with a reduction in the size of the protein (7.5 S, Stokes radius = 50 A, Mr approximately 169,000) and an increase in symmetry (f/f0 = 1.4), due to the loss of a subunit of Mr approximately 67,000. At pH 6 or lower, the Mr = 169,000 sterol-protein complex was altered so that reversible dissociation to give a smaller (4.2 S, Stokes radius = 53 A, Mr = 97,000) more asymmetric (f/f0 = 1.8) sterol-protein complex occurred when it was sedimented in a sucrose gradient buffered at pH 7.4 containing 0.3 M KCl and 2.5 M urea. Irreversible dissociation of the 7.5 S, Mr = 169,000 form to a 4.2 S form occurred spontaneously when the complex in whole cytosol buffered at pH 7.8 was allowed to stand overnight at 0 degree C, or when the partially purified complex was incubated at pH 5.5 at 0 degree C for several days. The partially purified, unliganded binding protein was unstable at 0 degree C (approximately 75% loss of binding activity in 24 h) whereas the liganded protein was stable for 7 days at 0 degree C although irreversible conversion to a 4.2 S form occurred under some conditions. Rates of sterol binding and dissociation were increased in the presence of 2.5 M urea at pH 7.4 or when the pH was lowered to 5.5 Kd values were not greatly altered under the various incubation conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1534619350,"Oxidation of reduced p-OH-benzoate hydroxylase . 2,4-diOH-benzoate complex by molecular oxygen occurs in four clearly defined steps. Inclusion of azide in the reaction medium slows the rate for each step. We have found that the rates for the last three steps as well as the UV/visible absorbance spectrum for the second intermediate are markedly dependent on pH. Formation of intermediate II is base-catalyzed while its decay to intermediate III is acid-catalyzed. Formation of oxidized enzyme from intermediate III is base-catalyzed. The spectrum of intermediate II is shifted to longer wavelengths on raising the pH. A pKa of about 7.8 can be calculated for each of these pH-dependent transitions, except for the rate of formation of oxidized enzyme. This rate appears to be directly dependent on hydroxide ion concentration. The presence of azide does not change the observed pH dependence. These results are discussed in the context of a 4a,5-ring opened flavin structure for intermediate II."
https://openalex.org/W1510217308,"Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.99.2) and sarcosine dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.99.1) are the folate binding proteins of rat liver mitochondria. These two enzymes contain covalently bound flavin and catalyze similar oxidative demethylation reactions (Wittwer, A. J., and Wagner, C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 4102-4108). Flavin-peptides have been purified from these two enzymes after proteolytic digestion by trypsin and chymotrypsin. The spectral and chromatographic properties of these flavin peptides changed after treatment with nucleotide pyrophosphatase in a manner consistent with the conversion of an FAD-peptide to an FMN-peptide. The pKa for pH-dependent fluorescence quenching of the purified flavin-peptides was not affected by borohydride reduction which, in conjunction with the pKa values, indicated that the flavin was covalently linked via the 8 alpha position of the isoalloxazine ring to an imidazole N(3) of a histidine residue. Peptides from both enzymes showed histidylflavin at the N terminus. Amino acid composition and sequence analysis showed that the flavin-peptide from dimethylglycine dehydrogenase was His(flavin)-Ala-Ala-Gly-Leu. Amino acid composition and N-terminal analysis suggested the sequence of the flavin-peptide of sarcosine dehydrogenase was His(flavin)-(Ala, Gly,Thr)-Leu."
https://openalex.org/W2090668296,"A novel eukaryotic hybrid gene has been constructed from the 5′ sequence of a rat gene and the bacterial neomycin-resistance gene. After transfection into hamster fibroblasts, the neo transcripts can be induced to high levels by the absence of glucose. Furthermore, this hybrid gene can be regulated by temperature when it is introduced into a temperature-sensitive mutant cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1998096147,"The antigen-specific receptor of C6VL T-lymphoma cells is a disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of 39 kd alpha chain and a 41 kd beta chain, both of which exhibit charge microheterogeneity. Pulse-chase labeling experiments indicate that epitopes reactive with the anti-receptor xenoantiserum #8177 were detectable by 2 min, while the clonotypic epitope reactive with monoclonal antibody 124-40 was not detectable until 10 min. Digestion with endoglycosidases H and F revealed that both subunits have at least three N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. The deglycosylated alpha and beta subunits were 27 and 32 kd, respectively. These data suggest that the dimeric receptor is formed shortly after translation, followed by extensive glycosylation. Emergence of the C6VL clonotypic epitope, and perhaps the antigen binding site, may therefore be dependent on post-assembly events."
https://openalex.org/W1616910360,"Three cationic glutathione S-transferase forms isolated from rat liver were characterized as dimers that originated from different combinations of two subunit types, Ya and Yc. The cationic forms were purified using lysyl glutathione affinity matrices and were chromatographically resolved from anionic glutathione S-transferases that contain Yb subunits. The three classes of cationic transferase exhibited similar specific activities with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as a substrate, all forms cross-reacted with antibodies to glutathione S-transferase B, and all had comparable secondary structures and tryptophan fluorescence properties. In spite of those similarities, the Yc-containing forms were clearly distinguishable from Ya forms on the basis of characteristic differences in circular dichroic patterns associated with their aromatic side chains. All cationic transferases bound bilirubin with stoichiometric ratios of 1 mol/dimeric protein molecule, but discrete differences in mode of binding were ascribed to forms containing Ya subunits as compared to Yc dimers. Binding to Yc forms was of lower affinity and may be associated with the catalytic region of the protein since glutathione effectively displaced bilirubin from the Yc component."
https://openalex.org/W88294639,"Using the technique for separating DNA fragments containing excision-repair sites from total genomic DNA as described in the previous paper (Cohn, S. M., and Lieberman, M. W. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12456-12462), we have developed a method for directly determining the distribution of excision-repair sites in the genome. DNA was prepared from confluent, diploid human fibroblasts which had been irradiated with ultraviolet light and incubated in the presence of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd), repaired fragments were isolated, and the dependence of the fraction of total DNA fragments containing excision-repair sites on DNA fragment length was determined by electrophoretic analysis. The observed dependence was compared to the relationship expected for a random distribution of repair sites. At 36 h following 3 J/m2 UV, the distribution of repair sites was indistinguishable from a random distribution; however, at doses of UV above 6 J/m2, the observed dependence indicated that the distribution of repair sites was nonrandom. A time course of the distribution of repair sites following 12 J/m2 UV was clearly nonrandom from 4 h after irradiation until at least 36 h following irradiation. By 72 h, however, the distribution had become random. In cells treated with hydroxyurea, a reduced number of excision-repair sites were present, but the distribution of repair sites was also nonrandom. Autoradiographic analysis of the amount of unscheduled DNA synthesis in individual nuclei suggested that the nonrandom distribution of repair sites did not result from variable extents of repair synthesis in different cell populations or from cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1558409828,"The structures of large O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides derived from swine trachea mucin glycoprotein were established. Reduced oligosaccharides released by treatment with alkaline borohydride were separated by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-6 and the neutral oligosaccharides were isolated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Eight oligosaccharides (DIa to BII), ranging in length from 8 to 15 sugar units, were isolated. On the basis of carbohydrate composition and analytical data from sequential treatment with exoglycosidases and permethylation analysis, the following structures were assigned to these oligosaccharides: (Formula: see text)."
https://openalex.org/W1569083160,"Yeast- and mycelial-form cells of the dimorphic fungus Mucor rouxii incubated with [U-14C]glucose were found to synthesize Man-P-dolichol, Glc-P-dolichol, and Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. The structure of the oligosaccharide moiety of the latter was similar to that of the same compound isolated from other eucaryotic cells. Oligosaccharides that migrated on paper chromatography as Man6-30GlcNAc standards were obtained upon treatment of delipidated proteins with a protease and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. The oligosaccharides that migrated apparently as single substances on paper chromatography could be separated into three different populations by paper electrophoresis in sodium borate buffer. The fastest migrating substances contained only mannose and N-acetylglucosamine residues, whereas the other two contained, in addition, different proportions of 3-O-methylmannose units. The oligosaccharides with the highest content of 3-O-methylmannose residues appeared to be completely resistant to alpha-mannosidase degradation; they were, however, cleaved by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. Mycelial cells synthesized a much higher proportion of 3-O-methylmannose-containing oligosaccharides than yeast cells. Cells incubated with [methyl-14C]methionine were found to label only the N-linked oligosaccharides containing 3-O-methylmannose residues. It is concluded that transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to protein is followed by excision of glucose and probably one or two mannose residues, followed by further mannosylation and in some cases also methylation of oligosaccharides. This represents a novel reaction in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2064391646,"Methods for deriving chemical information from a variety of systems and environments have changed dramatically in the last decade. Unique principles from physics, chemistry, and biology are the basis for sophisticated instruments that incorporate computers for data acquisition, reduction, and interpretation. Such analytical systems have shown orders-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity, specificity, and speed, yet with greater simplicity and lower price. The increasing importance of analytical instrumentation requires reexamination of its coverage in educational curricula and of the role of the analytical chemist in its further development and application."
https://openalex.org/W1551655835,"Digitonin-solubilized cardiac muscarinic receptors were reconstituted by dialysis into human erythrocyte acceptor membranes which lack high-affinity muscarinic receptors. The number of receptors reconstituted was proportional to the quantity of soluble receptors added to the reconstitution system. Specific [3H](-)-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to the reconstituted receptor was found to be saturable with a Kd (dissociation constant) equal to 48 +/- 4 pM and a Bmax (maximal density of binding sites) equal to 50 +/- 5 fmol/mg of protein. Competitive binding studies indicated that the reconstituted receptors showed stereoselectivity and drug specificity consistent with a high-affinity muscarinic receptor. Agonist binding to the reconstituted receptor was decreased by the addition of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. Sixty per cent of the reconstituted receptors were found to be integral membrane proteins. The molecular weight of the reconstituted receptor as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis was 76,000 +/- 2,000 and was identical to the molecular weight of the muscarinic receptor in the original cardiac membranes. The data indicate that a partially functional, intact muscarinic receptor was reconstituted into human erythrocyte acceptor membranes and that membrane constituents may be required to stabilize the receptor in a high-affinity state for antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W1598873264,"The technique of two-dimensional electrophoresis was used in combination with a highly sensitive silver stain to study vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein (CaBP) in rat kidney. Rat renal CaBP was shown to co-migrate almost exactly with CaBP purified from chick intestine suggesting evolutionary conservation of this protein. In some cases rat renal CaBP appeared not as a single polypeptide, but rather as a cluster of 4 polypeptides. Formation of the satellite cluster of CaBP in response to high doses of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 occurred in young rats which had been maintained on a vitamin D-deficient diet for 2 weeks, as well as in older rats which had been maintained on the same diet for 5 months. The 4 forms of CaBP were not the result of various states of Ca2+ binding, but rather the result of an enzymatic reaction. This was shown by 3 experiments. 1) Adding excess EGTA to samples containing the 4 satellite forms did not change the two-dimensional electrophoretogram. 2) Incubation of purified chick intestinal CaBP with kidney cytosols from D-deficient rats brought about the formation of the satellite CaBP forms from the chick protein. However, purified chick CaBP was unchanged by incubation in buffer alone for up to 2 h at 37 degrees C. 3) Placing rat kidney cytosols in a boiling water bath for 10 min inactivated the factor which generated the satellite forms as would be expected for an enzyme. The physiological significance of these forms of CaBP is as yet unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1579405605,"Two peptides from the amino terminus of human interferon-beta were synthesized corresponding to amino acids 1-21 and 18-45. The peptides were conjugated to bovine serum albumin, and rabbits were immunized with either the (1-21)- or the (18-45)-peptide conjugate. Antibodies to the synthetic peptides were detected in the sera using a radioimmunoassay with 125I-labeled peptide. Two of the antisera, one against peptide 1-21 and one against peptide 18-45, immunoprecipitated [35S]interferon-beta. The former was used to study the biosynthesis of interferon-beta in human diploid fibroblasts. In cells induced with double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C] to synthesize interferon-beta, two intracellular proteins with estimated molecular weights of 23,000 and 18,000 were precipitated with the antiserum. Three exocellular proteins from the same induced cells were precipitated with molecular weights of 23,000, 18,000, and 10,000. Reduced amounts of the intra- and exocellular Mr = 23,000 component and enhanced amounts of the Mr = 18,000 component were observed when induced cells were treated with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. Neither the antibody to peptide 1-21, the antibody to peptide 18-45, nor a combination of both antibodies neutralized the interferon-beta antiviral activity. We conclude that the amino terminus of interferon-beta may not be involved in the binding of interferon-beta to its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1594167283,"We have previously reported the isolation and characterization of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants defective in the internalization of ricin (Ray, B., and Wu, H.C. (1982) Mol. Cell. Biol. 2, 535-544). These mutants also do not exhibit the enhancement of ricin internalization by nigericin pretreatment at a low concentration, which is observed in the wild-type CHO cells. An analysis of somatic cell hybrids between the mutant and the toxin-sensitive wild-type CHO cell line shows that all of the phenotypes associated with the toxin resistance mutation are dominant in the hybrid cell lines. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [3H]palmitic acid-labeled cell extracts from the mutant and toxin-resistant hybrid cell lines has revealed an increased incorporation of [3H] palmitic acid into two proteins with apparent molecular weights near 30,000 in the mutant and hybrid cells as compared to that in the wild-type cell line. Our studies indicate that these two fatty acyl proteins might be related to a dominant mutation(s) which results in a decreased uptake of ricin."
