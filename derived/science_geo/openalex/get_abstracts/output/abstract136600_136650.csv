https://openalex.org/W2046741906,Naked metallic and semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were dissolved in organic solutions by derivatization with thionychloride and octadecylamine. Both ionic (charge transfer) and covalent solution-phase chemistry with concomitant modulation of the SWNT band structure were demonstrated. Solution-phase near-infrared spectroscopy was used to study the effects of chemical modifications on the band gaps of the SWNTs. Reaction of soluble SWNTs with dichlorocarbene led to functionalization of the nanotube walls.

The analysis indicates that the major initial effect of IFN is to block virion production or release, with blocking efficacies of 81, 95, and 96% for daily doses of 5, 10, and 15 million international units, respectively. The estimated virion half-life ( t 1/2 ) was, on average, 2.7 hours, with pretreatment production and clearance of 10 12 virions per day. The estimated infected cell death rate exhibited large interpatient variation (corresponding t 1/2 = 1.7 to 70 days), was inversely correlated with baseline viral load, and was positively correlated with alanine aminotransferase levels. Fast death rates were predictive of virus being undetectable by polymerase chain reaction at 3 months. These findings show that infection with hepatitis C virus is highly dynamic and that early monitoring of viral load can help guide therapy."

Because the process of supercurrent conversion at a superconductor-metal interface (Andreev reflection) is limited by the minority spin population near the Fermi surface, the differential conductance of the point contact can reveal the spin polarization of the metal. This technique has been applied to a variety of metals where the spin polarization ranges from 35 to 90 percent: Ni0.8Fe0.2, Ni, Co, Fe, NiMnSb, La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, and CrO2."

https://openalex.org/W2049873418,"Apoptosis is essential for the precise regulation of cellular homeostasis and development. The role in vivo of Apaf1, a mammalian homolog of C. elegans CED-4, was investigated in gene-targeted Apaf1−/− mice. Apaf1-deficient mice exhibited reduced apoptosis in the brain and striking craniofacial abnormalities with hyperproliferation of neuronal cells. Apaf1-deficient cells were resistant to a variety of apoptotic stimuli, and the processing of Caspases 2, 3, and 8 was impaired. However, both Apaf1−/− thymocytes and activated T lymphocytes were sensitive to Fas-induced killing, showing that Fas-mediated apoptosis in these cells is independent of Apaf1. These data indicate that Apaf1 plays a central role in the common events of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in most death pathways and that this role is critical for normal development."

Granulysin, a protein found in granules of CTLs, reduced the viability of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and parasites in vitro. Granulysin directly killed extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis, altering the membrane integrity of the bacillus, and, in combination with perforin, decreased the viability of intracellular M. tuberculosis. The ability of CTLs to kill intracellular M. tuberculosis was dependent on the presence of granulysin in cytotoxic granules, defining a mechanism by which T cells directly contribute to immunity against intracellular pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2056574134,"We have established a line of transgenic mice expressing the A. victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the promoter for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Mice bearing the transgene show green cellular fluorescence around the healing margins and throughout the granulation tissue of superficial ulcerative wounds. Implantation of solid tumors in the transgenic mice leads to an accumulation of green fluorescence resulting from tumor induction of host VEGF promoter activity. With time, the fluorescent cells invade the tumor and can be seen throughout the tumor mass. Spontaneous mammary tumors induced by oncogene expression in the VEGF-GFP mouse show strong stromal, but not tumor, expression of GFP. In both wound and tumor models the predominant GFP-positive cells are fibroblasts. The finding that the VEGF promoter of nontransformed cells is strongly activated by the tumor microenvironment points to a need to analyze and understand stromal cell collaboration in tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2086590817,"A typical scene contains many different objects, but the capacity of the visual system to process multiple stimuli at a given time is limited. Thus, attentional mechanisms are required to select relevant objects from among the many objects competing for visual processing. Evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in humans showed that when multiple stimuli are present simultaneously in the visual field, their cortical representations within the object recognition pathway interact in a competitive, suppressive fashion. Directing attention to one of the stimuli counteracts the suppressive influence of nearby stimuli. This mechanism may serve to filter out irrelevant information in cluttered visual scenes."
https://openalex.org/W2085601531,"The cytosolic protein APAF1, human homolog of C. elegans CED-4, participates in the CASPASE 9 (CASP9)-dependent activation of CASP3 in the general apoptotic pathway. We have generated by gene trap a null allele of the murine Apaf1. Homozygous mutants die at embryonic day 16.5. Their phenotype includes severe craniofacial malformations, brain overgrowth, persistence of the interdigital webs, and dramatic alterations of the lens and retina. Homozygous embryonic fibroblasts exhibit reduced response to various apoptotic stimuli. In situ immunodetection shows that the absence of Apaf1 protein prevents the activation of Casp3 in vivo. In agreement with the reported function of CED-4 in C. elegans, this phenotype can be correlated with a defect of apoptosis. Our findings suggest that Apaf1 is essential for Casp3 activation in embryonic brain and is a key regulator of developmental programmed cell death in mammals."

TGFbeta transduces its signal to the interior of the cell via Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4. We report the cloning and targeted disruption of the mouse Smad3 gene. Smad3 mutant mice are viable and fertile. Between 4 and 6 months of age, the Smad3 mutant mice become moribund with colorectal adenocarcinomas. The neoplasms penetrate through the intestinal wall and metastasize to lymph nodes. These results directly implicate TGFbeta signaling in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and provide a compelling animal model for the study of human colorectal cancer."

Hydrogen was flowing over the anode and was converted into protons that were transported through the solid electrolyte and reached the cathode (palladium) over which nitrogen was passing. At 570°C and atmospheric pressure, greater than 78 percent of the electrochemically supplied hydrogen was converted into ammonia.

https://openalex.org/W2091738825,"We identify a complex of three proteins in brain that has the potential to couple synaptic vesicle exocytosis to neuronal cell adhesion. The three proteins are: (1) CASK, a protein related to MAGUKs (membrane-associated guanylate kinases); (2) Mint1, a putative vesicular trafficking protein; and (3) Veli1, -2, and -3, vertebrate homologs of C. elegans LIN-7. CASK, Mint1, and Velis form a tight, salt-resistant complex that can be readily isolated. CASK, Mint1, and Velis contain PDZ domains in addition to other modules. However, no PDZ domains are involved in complex formation, leaving them free to recruit cell adhesion molecules, receptors, and channels to the complex. We propose that the tripartite complex acts as a nucleation site for the assembly of proteins involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and synaptic junctions."

https://openalex.org/W2040706104,"The presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. First, two missense mutations A30P and A53T cause inheritable early onset Parkinson's disease in some families. Secondly, alpha-synuclein is present in Lewy bodies of affected nerve cells in the predominant sporadic type of Parkinson's disease as well as in dementia with Lewy bodies. We demonstrate in the rat optic system that a portion of alpha-synuclein is carried by the vesicle-moving fast component of axonal transport and that it binds to rat brain vesicles through its amino-terminal repeat region. We find alpha-synuclein with the A30P mutation of familial Parkinson's disease devoid of vesicle-binding activity and propose that mutant alpha-synuclein may accumulate, leading to assembly into Lewy body filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2047649254,"Hereditary multiple exostoses, characterized by multiple cartilaginous tumors, is ascribed to mutations at three distinct loci, denoted EXT1-3. Here, we report the purification of a protein from bovine serum that harbored the D-glucuronyl (GlcA) and N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl (GlcNAc) transferase activities required for biosynthesis of the glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate (HS). This protein was identified as EXT2. Expression of EXT2 yielded a protein with both glycosyltransferase activities. Moreover, EXT1, previously found to rescue defective HS biosynthesis (McCormick, C., Leduc, Y., Martindale, D., Mattison, K., Esford, L. E., Dyer, A. P., and Tufaro, F. (1998) Nat. Genet. 19, 158-161), was shown to elevate the low GlcA and GlcNAc transferase levels of mutant cells. Thus at least two members of the EXT family of tumor suppressors encode glycosyltransferases involved in the chain elongation step of HS biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2136714025,"In this work, the 100-kDa neurotensin (NT) receptor previously purified from human brain by affinity chromatography (Zsürger, N., Mazella, J., and Vincent, J. P. (1994) Brain Res. 639, 245–252) was cloned from a human brain cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a 833-amino acid protein 100% identical to the recently cloned gp95/sortilin and was then designated NT3 receptor-gp95/sortilin. The N terminus of the purified protein is identical to the sequence of the purified gp95/sortilin located immediately after the furin cleavage site. The binding of iodinated NT to 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid-solubilized extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with the cloned cDNA was saturable and reversible with an affinity of 10–15 nm. The localization of the NT3 receptor-gp95/sortilin into intracellular vesicles was in agreement with previous results obtained with the purified receptor and with gp95/sortilin. Affinity labeling and binding experiments showed that the 110-kDa NT3 receptor can be partly transformed into a higher affinity (K d = 0.3 nm) 100-kDa protein receptor by cotransfection with furin.

The neuropeptide neurotensin (NT)1 exerts distinct central and peripheral effects in mammals (see Ref. 1Vincent J.P. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar for review). Central administration of NT modulates dopaminergic transmission and triggers hypothermic and naloxone-insensitive analgesic responses, whereas in the periphery, NT induces hypotension, decreases gastric acid secretion, and activates lipid digestion (1Vincent J.P. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Both central and peripheral actions of NT are initiated by association of the peptide to specific receptors located on the plasma membrane of target cells. Two different NT receptors have been cloned in the last years and shown to belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors (2Tanaka K. Masu M. Nakanishi S.

Masu M. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1990; 4: 847-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). However, SR48692 was unable to block a series of NT effects including central analgesia and hypothermia (7Dubuc I. Costentin J. Terranova J.P. Barnouin M.C. Soubrié P. Le Fur G. Rostène W. Kitabgi P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that these effects could be mediated either by the lately cloned low affinity NT2 receptor (4Chalon P. Vita N.

We previously described the solubilization and purification of a 100-kDa NT receptor from mouse and human brain (8Mazella J. Chabry J. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 144-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mazella J. Chabry J. Zsürger N. Vincent J.P. J. Biol.

This 100-kDa receptor protein has been observed in primary cultures of neurons from embryonic mice together with the NT1 receptor and shown to be implicated in the internalization mechanism of NT (11Chabry J. Gaudriault G. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17138-17144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 100-kDa protein is initially localized in an intracellular vesicular compartment and appears to the plasma membrane only after the NT-induced sequestration of the NT1 receptor, which is initially present at the cell surface (11Chabry J. Gaudriault G. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17138-17144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, only the 100-kDa protein can be solubilized under an active form by the detergent CHAPS, explaining why this receptor has been selected in our purification studies based upon CHAPS solubilization and affinity chromatography (9Mazella J. Chabry J. Zsürger N. Vincent J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5559-5563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Zsurger N. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We describe in this work the cloning and the expression of the 100-kDa NT receptor. This receptor was found to be 100% homologous to the recently cloned gp95/sortilin (12Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), a protein involved in the sorting of receptors and identified by its ability to interact with a receptor-associated protein (13Bu G. Geuze H. Strous G. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Sortilin structurally differs from the two other cloned G-protein-coupled NT receptors and is similar to the mannose 6-phosphate receptor bearing a single transmembrane domain (14Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Binding and photoaffinity labeling experiments carried out on COS-7 cells transfected with the cloned cDNA allowed us to demonstrate that sortilin is the 100-kDa NT receptor. The 100-kDa human NT receptor was purified from CHAPS-solubilized brain membranes by affinity chromatography (10Zsurger N. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After a final purification step on SDS-PAGE and protein transfer on Immobilon membrane, the N-terminal sequence of the purified protein was determined by the Edman degradation procedure. The nucleotide sequence derived from the N-terminal peptide was found to be 91.3% identical to a cDNA identified from a human retina library. Various oligonucleotides were derived from the cDNA sequence and used as probes to screen a human brain library (15Vita N. Laurent P. Lefort S. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Kaghad M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Positive clones were identified and sequenced as described elsewhere (15Vita N. Laurent P. Lefort S. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Kaghad M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed with 2–4 μg of recombinant plasmid by the DEAE-dextran precipitation method (16Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) onto semi-confluent COS-7 cells grown in 100-mm cell culture dishes. Homogenates were prepared from COS-7 cells after approximately 60 h of transfection as described previously (17Chabry J. Labbé-Jullié C. Gully D. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cell homogenates were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol (w/v), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (Tris glycerol buffer). Solubilization was carried out in the Tris glycerol buffer containing 0.6% CHAPS and 0.12% CHS as initially described (8Mazella J. Chabry J. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 144-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad procedure with ovalbumin as a standard. CHAPS-solubilized extracts (25 μg of protein) were incubated with [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin (2000 or 50 Ci/mmol) for 1 h at 0 °C in 250 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS (w/v), and 0.02% CHS (CHAPS buffer). Bound ligand was separated from free ligand by filtration on GF/B filters pretreated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine (17Chabry J. Labbé-Jullié C. Gully D. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Filters were rapidly washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold CHAPS buffer and then counted for radioactivity. Crude and CHAPS-solubilized homogenates from nontransfected COS-7 cells were totally devoid of specific [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin binding. CHAPS-solubilized extracts (100 μg) were incubated for 60 min at 0 °C with [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin (0.4 nm) in 250 μl of CHAPS buffer in the presence or in the absence of 1 μm unlabeled neurotensin. Bound radioactivity was separated from free ligand by loading an aliquot (200 μl) on a 5-ml column of Sephadex G-50 (medium) equilibrated with a 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.1% CHAPS, 0.02% CHS, and protease inhibitors. The column was eluted with 1.3 ml of the equilibration buffer, and the corresponding eluate was discarded. The radioactive ligand bound to the soluble receptor was eluted with 0.7 ml of buffer. Disuccinimidyl suberate was added to a final concentration of 50 μm by dilution of a 10 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. The cross-linking reaction was terminated after 15 min at 0 °C by addition of 10 μl of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 9. Samples were immediately precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min at 0 °C. After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS and 0.05 mg/ml bromphenol blue before analysis by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) with 8% acrylamide resolving gel. Gel was stained by Coomassie Brillant Blue and dried before autoradiography for 1–2 weeks on Kodak XAR5 with a DuPont Cronex Light-Night Plus intensifying screen. After purification by affinity chromatography and SDS-PAGE (10Zsurger N. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the 100-kDa human brain NT receptor was identified by affinity labeling (10Zsurger N. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) then directly sequenced by Edman degradation. The first 23 amino acid residues identified were found to be identical to the protein sequence derived from a cDNA sequence of the data base. Oligonucleotides corresponding to this cDNA sequence were used as probes to screen a human brain cDNA library. Hybridization-positive clones were then purified. Sequence analysis revealed an homology of 100% with the previously cloned protein sortilin (12Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of this cDNA encoded a protein of 833 residues (gp95/sortilin) containing a signal peptide, a putative cleavage site of furin and a single transmembrane domain (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequence obtained after purification of the human brain NT receptor is positioned just after the putative cleavage site of the protein convertase furin (Fig. 1), indicating that furin cleavage does occur in brain and that our sequence corresponds to the N terminus of the naturally expressed protein (10Zsurger N. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that sortilin is indeed able to selectively bind NT, COS-7 cells were transfected with the recombinant plasmid encoding the cloned cDNA. Whole cells as well as membrane homogenates were found to be devoid of specific [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin binding, indicating that no NT receptor was expressed at the surface of COS cells. However, when transfected cells were solubilized by CHAPS under conditions identical to those used for the purification of mouse or human NT receptor (9Mazella J. Chabry J. Zsürger N. Vincent J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5559-5563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zsurger N. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin bound specifically to solubilized cell extracts according to a rapid association kinetic that reached a plateau value within 3–5 min at 0 °C (Fig. 2). The inset of Fig. 2 A shows that a semilogarithmic plot of the data is linear, as expected for a pseudo-first order reaction. The rate constant of the association is: k =k a [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin + k d, where k a and k d represent the second order rate constant of association and the first order rate constant of dissociation of the [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin-receptor complex, respectively (8Mazella J. Chabry J. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 144-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The value of k calculated from the slope of the semi-logarithmic plot was found to be 2.2 ± 0.3 × 10−2 s−1. Fig. 2 B demonstrates that the binding of [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin to CHAPS-soluble extracts is a reversible process. Dissociation of bound [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin was initiated by addition of 1 μm unlabeled NT after the plateau value of the association kinetics was reached. As shown by the linearity of the semilogarithmic representation (inset, Fig. 2 B), the dissociation is a first order process with k d as a rate constant. The value of k d calculated from the slope was 1.8 ± 0.2 × 10−2 s−1, not significantly different from k. When association and dissociation kinetics were performed with 5.5 nm[125I-Tyr3]neurotensin, identicalk and k d values were obtained (not shown), indicating that the termk a[125I-Tyr3]neurotensin was always negligible as compared with k d and thatk was representative only of the k dvalue. In these conditions, it was not possible to calculate thek a value and then to estimate the dissociation constant K d =k d/k a. Saturation experiments were carried out to determine directly theK d value for the binding of [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin to CHAPS-solubilized extracts of cells transfected with the cloned cDNA. CHAPS-solubilized extracts (15–30 μg of protein) were incubated for 10–20 min at 0 °C with increasing concentrations of [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin (50 Ci/mmol, from 0.2 to 15 nm), and the bound radioactivity was determined by filtration. The binding of [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin was specific and saturable (Fig. 3), and the corresponding binding parameters were K d = 10 ± 3 nm and B max = 4 ± 1 pmol/mg. The difference observed between the K d value (10 nm) of the cloned NT3 receptor expressed in COS cells and the K d value (0.3 nm) determined for the purified human brain NT receptor (10Zsurger N. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) could result from the absence of cleavage at the furin site for the expressed NT3 receptor. To check this hypothesis, saturation experiments were performed on solubilized extracts prepared from COS-7 cells transfected either with the NT3 recombinant plasmid alone or with both the NT3 plasmid and a plasmid expressing the protein convertase furin (Fig. 4). Scatchard representation of the binding experiments carried out on soluble extracts of COS cells transfected only with the NT3 plasmid was linear and corresponded to a single class of NT-binding sites with a K d of 10 nm (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, CHAPS-soluble extracts of cells cotransfected with both the NT3 and furin plasmids gave a curvilinear Scatchard representation with an upward concavity (Fig. 4 B). These data could be perfectly fitted to the equation describing the binding of a ligand to two different classes of independent binding sites (19Fehlman M. Morin O. Kitabgi P. Freychet P. Endocrinology. 1981; 109: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Each site is represented by a straight line in Fig. 4 B. Binding parameters determined in three different experiments were K dH = 0.7 ± 0.1 nm, B maxH = 320 ± 45 fmol/mg and K dL = 15 ± 4 nm,B maxL = 3.2 ± 0.8 pmol/mg for the high (H) and low (L) affinity NT-binding sites, respectively. Thus cotransfection of NT3 with furin into COS cells partly convert the expressed receptor (K d = 10 nm) into an higher affinity form (K d = 0.4 nm). Soluble extracts prepared from cells transfected with NT3 alone or with NT3 plus furin were covalently labeled at 0 °C with [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin using the chemical reagent disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS). Fig. 4 A shows autoradiograms of the corresponding SDS-PAGE experiments. In the absence of furin, a single protein band with aM r of about 110 kDa was selectively labeled because it can be protected by the addition of 1 μmunlabeled NT in the incubation medium (Fig. 4 A, inset). In the presence of furin, although the same protein band was observed, a second band with a M r of 100 kDa was also specifically labeled (Fig. 4 B, inset), indicating a partial maturation of the receptor by the protein convertase. Note that autoradiogram of the covalent labeling experiment carried out on soluble extracts prepared from nontransfected COS-7 cells was totally devoid of specifically labeled protein (Fig. 4 B, inset). To determine the binding specificity of the cloned human brain NT receptor, we tested the ability of NT agonists or antagonists or of unrelated peptides to inhibit the binding of [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin to the CHAPS-solubilized NT3 receptor (Fig. 5). NT and Trp11NT inhibited the specific binding of [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin with identical potencies (IC50 = 17 nm). Neuromedin N and DTrp11NT were 3.5- and 4-fold less potent with IC50 of 63 and 72 nm, respectively. The nonpeptide antagonist SR48692 was poorly effective with an IC50 of 3 μm, and levocabastine was unable to inhibit [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin binding up to 10 μm. We also verified that neuropeptides unrelated to NT such as vasoactive intestinal peptide, somatostatin, and deltorphin were totally devoid of activity (not shown). The 100-kDa NT receptor (NT3) cloned in this work corresponds to the 95-kDa protein designated gp95/sortilin previously purified by receptor-associated protein affinity chromatography and cloned (12Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The structure of this protein bearing a single transmembrane domain is related to known sorting receptors as the yeast Vps10p and the CI-M6P receptor (14Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 20Marcusson E.G. Horazdovsky B.F. Cereghino J.L. Gharakhanian E. Emr S.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 579-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) but is totally different from the two G-protein-coupled NT receptors previously cloned. As far as we are aware, the NT3/gp95/sortilin protein described here is the first neuropeptide receptor that does not belong to the family of the G-protein-coupled receptors. The 100-kDa NT-binding protein purified from human brain occurred in neurons as a truncated form cleaved at the furin site present in the N-terminal part (amino acids 41–44) of the receptor. When solubilized by the detergent CHAPS, this matured protein bound [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin with a high affinity (K d = 0.3 nm) (10Zsurger N. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the present study, the affinity of iodinated NT for CHAPS-solubilized homogenates prepared from cells transfected with the cDNA encoding the total protein was calculated to be between 10 and 15 nm. To determine whether this relatively low affinity was the consequence of the absence of furin cleavage in the cell line used for expression, we co-transfected the cDNA of NT3/gp95/sortilin and the cDNA encoding the protein convertase furin. In these conditions, Scatchard plot from saturation experiments revealed the appearance of a high affinity NT-binding component (K d = 0.7 nm), which represented 8–10% of the total NT-binding sites (Fig. 4 B). These results strongly suggested that although total maturation was not effective, a portion of the protein was truncated to give a receptor able to bind NT with a higher affinity. Interestingly, this hypothesis was corroborated by affinity labeling experiments performed on CHAPS-solubilized extracts from co-transfected cells. In that case, a lower molecular weight band (M r = 100,000–105,000) was detected together with the protein of 110 kDa already observed in extracts from cells transfected with NT3 alone (Fig. 4 B, inset). The 100–105-kDa labeled protein most probably corresponded to the furin-cleaved form of the 110-kDa protein. To definitely demonstrate this proposal, we are trying to find cotransfection conditions leading to a more complete maturation of the low affinity 110-kDa protein into its high affinity, naturally occurring form. Taking into account the difference of affinity between the cloned and the purified NT3 receptor, structure-function relationships toward NT analogs or antagonist are similar except for Trp11-NT, which displays a potency identical to that of NT on the cloned CHAPS-solubilized receptor, whereas Trp11-NT was 10-fold less potent than the native peptide on the purified CHAPS-solubilized receptor (10Zsurger N. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As expected from our previous study carried out on primary cultures of neurons (11Chabry J. Gaudriault G. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17138-17144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no detectable binding of [125I-Tyr3]neurotensin was observed on whole cells or on crude homogenates from cells transfected with NT3, indicating that the receptor is not expressed at the cell surface. This result is in agreement with the localization by confocal microscopy of gp95/sortilin in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi compartment and with the absence of detectable protein on the cell surface after transfection in COS-1 cells (12Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The NT3/gp95/sortilin protein could recognize NT by its extracellular binding site only after translocation to the plasma membrane. By contrast, the binding site of NT3 localized in vesicular structures is directed toward the inner part of vesicles and remains inaccessible to NT in the absence of CHAPS solubilization. Both the subcellular localization and properties after CHAPS treatment of the NT3/gp95/sortilin protein are in agreement with our previous purification data (10Zsurger N. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The NT3/gp95/sortilin protein is colocalized with the glucose transporter Glut4, the insulin-like growth factor/mannose 6-phosphate (IGF-II/Man-6-P) receptor, and the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase in 3T3-L1 adipocyte vesicles (21Lin B.Z. Pilch P.F. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24145-24147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These proteins are cotranslocated to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (21Lin B.Z. Pilch P.F. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24145-24147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Morris N.J. Ross S.A. Lane W.S. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3582-3587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cytoplasmic tail of NT3/gp95/sortilin contains a nine-residue sequence identical with the phosphorylation site and sorting signal in the C terminus of the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the NT-regulated function of the NT3/gp95/sortilin receptor could be very similar to the IGF-II-regulated function of the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor in adipocytes. Both receptor proteins may serve to clear their specific ligand from the circulation, to regulate the translocation of Glut-4-containing vesicles via their phosphorylation, or to be involved in the biogenesis of these vesicles (21Lin B.Z. Pilch P.F. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24145-24147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In conclusion, cloning and expression of the NT receptor previously purified in this laboratory allowed us to demonstrate that the purified 100-kDa receptor is identical to gp95/sortilin. These data open the way to future studies devoted to the elucidation of the physiological function of the NT3/gp95/sortilin protein."

Yeast two-hybrid, in vitro binding, and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation experiments show that LIN-2, LIN-7, and LIN-10 form a protein complex. Furthermore, compensatory mutations in lin-7 and let-23 exhibit allele-specific suppression of apical mislocalization and signaling-defective phenotypes. These results present a mechanism for basolateral localization of LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase by direct binding to the LIN-2/LIN-7/LIN-10 complex.

While bound to Sec61p, the signal sequence forms a helix that is contacted on one side by Sec62p and Sec71p. The binding site is located at the interface of the protein channel and the lipid bilayer.

These observations have been interpreted as indicating that StAR acts on the outer mitochondrial membrane to promote cholesterol delivery to cytochrome P450scc.

The present experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that StAR is a sterol transfer protein. To this end, we examined the ability of recombinant N-62 StAR to stimulate the movement of lipids from donor vesicles to acceptor membranes.

Microsomes were prepared from the post-mitochondrial supernatant of rat liver homogenates. 3 mg of the organelle protein was added as acceptor in each assay in a final volume of 500 μl 20 mm Tris buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg of bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, with the indicated concentration of recombinant N-62 His6 tag StAR or SCP2. The organelle preparations were pre-heated at 60 °C for 30 min to denature endogenous lipases as described previously (13Bloj B. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1613-1619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In selected experiments, the heat-treated mitochondria were also treated with trypsin (200 μg/ml) for 40 min at 4 °C. The trypsin was then neutralized with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1.25 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor for 10 min at 4 °C prior to the transfer assay. The data presented in Figs. 1, 2, and 4 represent the stimulation of lipid transfer over that occurring in the absence of added recombinant protein. In addition, all results presented in these figures were corrected for the small amount of liposome-acceptor fusion/trapping detected by the transfer of [3H]triolein, which always amounted to <10%, and usually ≤3%, of N-62 StAR- or SCP2-stimulated lipid transfer.

(15Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44969) Google Scholar). Endosomal transferrin receptors were detected with a mouse anti-transferrin receptor antibody purchased fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), whereas mitochondrial heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) was detected with a mouse anti-HSP70 antibody obtained from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). Antibody detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies purchased from Cappel (Durham, NC) and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. C-His6 tag N-62 StAR stimulated cholesterol transfer from sterol-rich liposomes to heat-treated rat liver mitochondria in a dose- and time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1). 10 nm StAR promoted cholesterol transfer from donor vesicles with movement of 2.9% of the donor cholesterol after 20 min. At 100 nm there was 18% transfer, and there was 39% transfer at 400 nm recombinant StAR protein. A plateau in cholesterol transfer was reached at 1–4 μm StAR protein, resulting in 60% cholesterol transfer from donor vesicles to the heat-treated mitochondria. The incubation medium in all cases contained 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the reported lipid transfer activities in Fig. 1 reflect sterol transfer above that occurring in the absence of recombinant protein. C-His6 tag N-62 StAR stimulated sterol transfer to heat-treated mouse and rat liver, bovine corpus luteum, and yeast mitochondria to a similar extent (data not shown). Hence, rat liver mitochondria were used in most of the studies. The action of C-His6 tag N-62 StAR on cholesterol transfer was rapid, with the majority of transfer occurring within 5 min of incubation at 37 °C. The cholesterol transfer activity of the C-His6 tag recombinant N-62 StAR protein was temperature-dependent because cholesterol transfer was minimal at 4 °C (Fig. 2). N-His6 tag N-62 StAR also displayed cholesterol transfer activity (Fig. 2), as did recombinant human SCP2 at a 1 μm concentration. The former finding demonstrates that the position of the His6 tag does not substantively influence sterol transfer activity of N-62 StAR. In contrast, heat-denatured C-His6 tag N-62 StAR and the C-His6 tag N-62 A218V mutant displayed minimal cholesterol transfer activity (<2.5 and <1% sterol transfer, respectively), even when added at concentrations greater than the wild-type recombinant protein (Fig. 2). Importantly, C-His6 tag N-62 StAR increased cholesterol transfer to heat-treated mitochondria that had been pre-treated with trypsin to digest outer mitochondrial membrane proteins. The efficacy of the trypsin treatment was documented by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, which revealed substantial degradation of mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 3). C-His6 tag N-62 StAR increased the transfer of cholesterol to heat-treated microsomes, as did SCP2 (Fig. 4). In contrast to SCP2, also called nonspecific lipid transfer protein because it promotes the transfer of a variety of lipids including various sterols, phospholipids, and glycolipids, N-62 C-His6 tag StAR did not stimulate phosphatidylcholine transfer to mitochondria or to microsomes (Fig. 4). The microsomal preparation was shown to have modest mitochondrial contamination by Western blot analysis of mitochondrial heat shock protein-70 (Fig. 5). The mitochondrial preparation did not contain detectable levels of the transferrin receptor, a microsomal/endosomal marker (Fig. 5). The specificity of C-His6 tag N-62 StAR sterol transfer activity was tested by examining the ability of the protein to promote transfer of the plant sterol, β-sitosterol. The C-His N-62 StAR protein enhanced β-sitosterol transfer from sterol-rich liposomes to heat-treated mitochondria to the same extent as it promotes cholesterol transfer (Table I).Table IC-His6 tag N-62 StAR stimulates transfer of β-sitosterol from liposomes to acceptor membranesRecombinant proteinTransferCholesterolβ-Sitosterol%N-62 C-His6 tag StAR7579SCP26878None63Liposomes containing either [14C]-labeled cholesterol or β-sitosterol were incubated with heat-treated mouse liver mitochondria for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 μm C-His6 tag N-62 StAR, SCP2, or no recombinant protein. All incubation mixtures contained 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The percentage of transfer of the labeled sterol was determined. Values presented are the means of duplicate assays that have not been corrected for apparent sterol transfer due to liposome trapping or fusion with acceptor organelles.

Open table in a new tab Liposomes containing either [14C]-labeled cholesterol or β-sitosterol were incubated with heat-treated mouse liver mitochondria for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 μm C-His6 tag N-62 StAR, SCP2, or no recombinant protein. All incubation mixtures contained 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The percentage of transfer of the labeled sterol was determined. Values presented are the means of duplicate assays that have not been corrected for apparent sterol transfer due to liposome trapping or fusion with acceptor organelles. The sterol transfer occurring in the absence of recombinant protein has not been subtracted from the N-62 C-His tag StAR and SCP2-stimulated values. Our observations demonstrate that N-62 StAR has sterol transfer activity with specificity that can be distinguished from SCP2, a protein that stimulates the transfer of several different lipids from donor vesicles to acceptor membranes. The fact that recombinant N-62 C-His6 tag StAR effectively stimulates sterol transfer from sterol-rich liposomes to heat-treated mitochondria isolated from various animal sources, to mitochondria that were trypsin-treated, and to microsomes demonstrates that StAR protein lacking the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence does not have acceptor organelle specificity and that it does not require heat- and/or trypsin-sensitive proteins on the acceptor for efficient sterol transfer. Indeed, these observations suggest that the specificity of action of the StAR protein is determined by the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. These conclusions support a bipartite model of functional domains in StAR: an organelle-specifying N terminus and a sterol transferring activity encoded by the remaining C terminus of the protein. StAR, like SCP2, does not distinguish between cholesterol and the plant sterol, β-sitosterol, a cholesterol structure with an ethyl group at carbon 24. However, further experiments are needed to determine whether the sterol transfer activity of StAR differentiates other features of the cholesterol molecule, including the 3-oxo function and the Δ5 double bond. StAR is a phosphoprotein (4Krueger R.J. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10159-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Epstein L.F. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19739-19745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation state of StAR is directly correlated with steroidogenesis (16Pon L.A. Hartigan J.A. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13309-13316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hartigan J.A. Green E.G. Mortenson R.M. Menachery A. Williams G.H. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the ability of StAR to be phosphorylated at serine residue 195, which is in the context of a consensus protein kinase A phosphorylation motif that is conserved in all species of StAR identified to date, is associated with increased steroidogenic activity (18Arakane F. King S.R. Du Y. Kallen C.B. Walsh L.P. Watari H. Stocco D.M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32656-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Because a StAR mutant that cannot be phosphorylated on serine 195 (S195A) had approximately 40% of the steroidogenic activity of the wild-type protein in transfected COS-1 cells, phosphorylation of StAR is evidently not obligatory for activity of StAR. The recombinant StAR protein used in the present studies is not phosphorylated. Thus, we can conclude that StAR does not need to be post-translationally modified to promote sterol transfer. It should also be noted that at present we do not know what percentage of the recombinant C-His6 tag N-62 StAR is properly folded and biologically active. Thus, the native protein may be active in promoting sterol transfer at much lower concentrations than those employed in the experiments described here. Because StAR is not found in large quantities in steroidogenic cells, a 1:1 carrier mechanism for sterol delivery to the inner mitochondrial membrane is unattractive. The promotion of membrane fusion by StAR is excluded as a mechanism because the amount of lipid transfer in our assays attributable to a fusion process was minimal. This is not consistent with models of StAR action based on a fusogenic role for the protein. A mechanism invoking formation of bridges between donor and acceptor membranes, as has been suggested previously for SCP2 action (14Billheimer J.T. Gaylor J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), is also unlikely because StAR evidently can act on the outer mitochondrial membrane and thus could not easily be envisioned to form bridges between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Therefore, we favor a “catalytic” process by which StAR promotes multiple molecules of sterol to move from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membranes. StAR perturbation of donor membrane structure, resulting in sterol desorption from the relatively cholesterol-rich outer mitochondrial membrane (19Martinez F. Strauss III, J.F. Subcell. Biochem. 1997; 28: 208-234Google Scholar) is a possible mechanism for substrate transfer to the cholesterol-poor inner mitochondrial membrane. This mechanism predicts that the direction of sterol flux is influenced by the abundance of sterol in the two membranes with net sterol transfer slowing or ceasing as the sterol contents of the donor and acceptor membranes equilibrate. In mitochondria, cholesterol provoked to exit the outer membrane by StAR might travel to inner the membrane via pre-existing contact sites. Enhanced sterol desorption has also been proposed as the explanation for the ability of SCP2 to increase sterol transfer in cell-free assays (20Schroeder F. Frolov A.A. Murphy E.J. Atshaves B.P. Jefferson J.R. Pu L. Wood W.G. Foxworth W.B. Kier A.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 213: 150-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, because StAR displays greater specificity for sterol transfer than SCP2, it is likely that the two proteins act by different molecular mechanisms. It has been attractive to envision StAR interacting with a protein “receptor” or recognition protein on the outer mitochondrial membrane. However, the fact that StAR can promote steroidogenesis by mitochondria of cells that do not normally produce steroid hormones (i.e. COS-1 cells transfected with the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme system) and that StAR can stimulate cholesterol transfer to mitochondrial as well as microsomal membranes argues against the existence of a receptor on mitochondria of steroidogenic cells for StAR-mediated steroidogenesis. In summary, the present studies demonstrate that StAR has sterol transfer activity that may account for its steroidogenic properties.

The structure of one such enzyme, type IIβ phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase, reveals a protein kinase ATP-binding core and demonstrates that all phosphoinositide kinases belong to one superfamily. The enzyme is a disc-shaped homodimer with a 33 × 48 Å basic flat face that suggests an electrostatic mechanism for plasma membrane targeting. Conserved basic residues form a putative phosphatidylinositol phosphate specificity site. The substrate-binding site is open on one side, consistent with dual specificity for phosphatidylinositol 3- and 5-phosphates.

https://openalex.org/W2018304885,"The transcription factor Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed and plays a significant role in the constitutive and induced expression of a variety of mammalian genes and may even contribute to tumorigenesis. Here, we describe a novel pathway whereby Sp1 promotes the transcription of vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor, by interacting directly and specifically with protein kinase C ζ (PKC ζ) isoform in renal cell carcinoma. PKC ζ binds and phosphorylates the zinc finger region of Sp1. Moreover, in the presence of the wild type von Hippel-Lindau gene product, the interaction of Sp1 with PKC ζ is inhibited, and in this manner steady state levels of Sp1 phosphorylation are decreased significantly. Co-transfection of renal cell carcinoma cells and human fibrosarcoma cells with a plasmid overexpressing PKC ζ and VPF/VEGF promoter luciferase constructs results in activation of Sp1-mediated transcription, whereas expression of a dominant-negative mutant of PKC ζ repressed this activation. Taken together, our results suggest a new pathway of cell signaling through PKC ζ and provide an insight into PKC ζ and Sp1-dependent transcriptional regulation of VPF/VEGF expression and thus tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2018721796,"We studied the structure of replication intermediates accumulated by Tus-induced arrest of plasmid DNA replication at termination sites. For intermediates generated both in vitro with purified components and in vivo, superhelical stress is distributed throughout the entire partially replicated molecule; daughter DNA segments are wound around each other, and the unreplicated region is supercoiled. Thus, unlinking of parental DNA strands by topoisomerases can be carried out both behind and in front of the replication fork. We explain why previous studies with prokaryotic and eukaryotic replication intermediates discerned only supercoiling in the unreplicated portion."

Coimmunoprecipitation of topoisomerase I and PSF from chromatographic fractions (200 μl) was achieved by addition of Scl-70 autoantibodies (IgG fraction) to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and NaCl to a final concentration of 400 mm. After incubation for 1 h at 20 °C, 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose were added (Pharmacia Biotech, equilibrated with PBS containing 1% casein and 0.05% Nonidet P-40), and incubation continued for 1 h at 20 °C. Finally, protein A-Sepharose was sedimented, washed, and eluted with 2% SDS, and eluates were analyzed by immunoblotting with PSF antibodies. For far Western blotting, the blots were renatured for 12 h at 20 °C with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween) and 5% fat-free milk. After renaturation the blots were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C with the biotinylated enzyme (10 ng/ml in PBS-Tween containing 2% bovine serum albumin). After washing (PBS-Tween + 0.5m NaCl) bound enzyme was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Avidix™) and a chemiluminescent substrate (CSPD™, both Tropix, Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Kinetic determinations of specific topoisomerase I activities were performed with 2.5 ng of pure topoisomerase I or equivalent amounts of the enzyme contained in other preparations and 0.3 μg of supercoiled pUC18 DNA. Reactions were carried out in a final volume of 20 μl of assay buffer (10 mm BisTris propane, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.3 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C and were stopped by addition of 1% SDS at the time points indicated. Samples were digested with proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml, 37 °C, 30 min). Relaxed and supercoiled plasmid forms were separated by submarine agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, visualized by UV transillumination, and photographed. Images were scanned, and the relative amounts of relaxed DNA were determined using the image analysis software NIH Image v.1.61. One unit of topoisomerase I activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required for relaxation of 150 ng of supercoiled pUC18 DNA within 30 min. Concentrations of pure recombinant topoisomerase I and pure recombinant human PSF were determined according to Bradford and served as a standard for determining the respective protein concentrations in crude nuclear extracts, preparations of PSF/p54 heterodimers, and trimeric coeluates by comparative immunoblotting. To test the effect of PSF or PSF/p54 on topoisomerase I activity, 2.5 ng of pure enzyme or an equivalent amount of topoisomerase I-PSF/p54 coeluate was preincubated (15 min, 37 °C) with 120 ng of pure recombinant human PSF or an equivalent amount of isolated native PSF/p54 dimer in a final volume of 20 μl of assay buffer. Quantitative results are represented as mean values ± standard error of the mean (standard deviation divided by square root of n − 1) of three or more independent measurements carried out independently on different days. Fluorescent images of cells are representative of the whole cell population inspected in at least 10 separate fields of view. Topoisomerase I can be purified from ammonium sulfate precipitates of human nuclear extracts by a single step of nickel affinity chromatography (9Rossi F. Labourier E. Forné T. Divita G. Derancourt J. Riou J. Antoine E. Cathala G. Brunel C. Tazi J. Nature. 1996; 381: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). By the same principle, we copurified here a set of three proteins (54, 100, and 115 kDa) from A431 cell nuclear extracts not subjected to high ammonium sulfate concentrations before chromatography (Fig. 1 a, lanes 1–3). Copurification in a constant stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:1 was conserved during several other chromatographic procedures including anion exchange (Fig. 1 a, lanes 4 and 5), cation exchange (Fig. 1 a, lanes 6and 7), and gel permeation chromatography (Fig. 1 b, top) but was disrupted by 1 murea (Fig. 1 a, lanes 8 and 9; Fig. 1 b, bottom) or 1 m ammonium sulfate (Fig. 4 a, lanes 2 and 4), suggesting complexation of these three proteins rather than similar matrix interactions. The 100-kDa protein was identified as topoisomerase I by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 a, lane 5), whereas the two other proteins were identified by N-terminal microsequencing. From the 115-kDa protein three peptide sequences identical to amino acid residues 4–21, 214–219, and 685–693 of human PSF (16Patton J.G. Porro E.B. Galceran J. Tempst P. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) were obtained. The identity of PSF was subsequently confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 a, lane 6). From the 54-kDa protein three peptide sequences identical to amino acid residues 4–14, 90–120, and 443–466 of human nuclear RNA-binding protein p54 (17Dong B. Horowitz D.S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) were obtained. PSF and topoisomerase I could be coimmunoprecipitated with topoisomerase I antibodies (Fig. 2 b, lane 3), and a specific binding of pure recombinant human topoisomerase I to PSF but not to p54 could be demonstrated by far Western blotting, probing renatured Western blots of crude nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 a, lane 3) or coeluates of topoisomerase I, PSF, and p54 (Fig. 2 b, lane 4) with biotinylated topoisomerase I. From the experiment in Fig. 2 a, lanes 3 and 4, it became apparent that topoisomerase I also binds strongly to itself, which suggests multimerization of the enzyme. Treatment of pure recombinant human topoisomerase I (Fig. 2 c, lane 5) with SMCC stabilized fractions of the enzyme in dimeric (30%) or trimeric (10%) complexes (Fig. 2 c, lane 1). When coeluates containing topoisomerase I, PSF, and p54 but no other proteins (Fig. 2 c, lane 6) were treated with SMCC, similar fractions of di- and trimeric topoisomerase I were obtained, but in addition, the enzyme became cross-linked into complexes much larger than homotrimers (Fig. 2 c, lane 2). These data indicate that human topoisomerase I binds PSF, which in turn is associated with p54.Figure 4Stimulation of topoisomerase I by PSF and PSF/p54. a, Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of preparations used for kinetic analysis.

During most of mitosis the two proteins were separated because PSF diffused into the cytosol in prometaphase (Fig. 3 a), remained excluded from the chromatin during metaphase (Fig. 3 b) and early anaphase (Fig. 3 c), and started to reassociate with the DNA in late anaphase (Fig. 3 d) and telophase (Fig. 3 e). Topoisomerase I, on the other hand, remained entirely chromatin-bound during all these mitotic steps. In most interphase cells both proteins had a diffuse nuclear distribution (in the case of PSF strictly excluding the nucleoli) and showed extended patches of colocalization in the extranucleolar nucleoplasm (Fig. 3 f, yellow patches), whereas in a minor fraction (5–10%) of interphase nuclei the two proteins showed grainy and inhomogeneous patterns and did not colocalize but, on the contrary, appeared to be compartmentalized away from each other (Fig. 3 g). These observations suggest that interactions between topoisomerase I and PSF can occur in the cell and might be governed by cell cycle-related redistribution and compartmentalization. Initially, we observed that topoisomerase I of human A431 cells was 8-fold more active in the context of a crude nuclear extract (Table I, line 8) than in the purified state (Table I, line 4). The pure enzyme of A431 cells had a specific activity of 2.9 × 103 units/μg similar to pure recombinant human topoisomerase I (Table I, line 1) and Ref. 19Liu L.F. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, whereas in the copurified complex with PSF/p54 topoisomerase I was even more active than in the nuclear extract (Table I, line 7). Thus, we assumed that the decrease in enzyme activity upon purification could be because of the removal of PSF/p54. To test this assumption, we preincubated pure recombinant (Fig. 4 a, lane 1) or endogeneous topoisomerase I (Fig. 4 a, lane 2) with pure recombinant PSF (Fig. 4 a, lane 3) or isolated native PSF/p54 dimer (Fig. 4 a, lane 4) and compared it to the copurified topoisomerase I-PSF/p54 complex (Fig. 4 a, lane 5). Such an experiment is shown in Fig. 4 b. Quantitative results are summarized in Table I. The isolated native PSF/p54 dimer, which did not have DNA relaxation activity of its own (Fig. 4 b), stimulated the activity of purified endogeneous topoisomerase I at least 16-fold (thus entirely restituting the activity of the trimeric complex), whereas it had a slightly lesser effect on recombinant human topoisomerase I. Recombinant human PSF also stimulated purified topoisomerase I but was 3 times less effective than the native PSF/p54 dimer. The activity of topoisomerase I in the copurified equimolar complex with PSF/p54 was insignificantly increased by preincubation with a 50-fold molar excess of recombinant human PSF or isolated native PSF/p54 dimer (Table I), suggesting that the stimulatory effect was saturated at equimolar ratios of the three proteins. In summary, these data show that PSF/p54 is a strong stimulator of topoisomerase I in human A431 cells.Table IStimulation of topoisomerase I activity by rhPSF or PSF/p54Compare Fig. 4 aSpecific activityRelative activitylaneunits/μgrhTopo I12800 ± 3001rhTopo I + rhPSF1 + 314,300 ± 28005.1 ± 1.0rhTopo I + PSF/p541 + 433,800 ± 380012.1 ± 1.4eTopo I22900 ± 2701 ± 0.1eTopo I + rhPSF2 + 314,800 ± 28005.3 ± 1.0eTopo I + PSF/p542 + 444,900 ± 200016.0 ± 0.7Complex545,550 ± 145016.3 ± 0.5Complex + rhPSF5 + 348,830 ± 366317.4 ± 1.3Complex + PSF/p545 + 454,350 ± 581519.4 ± 2.1Nuclear extract22,400 ± 52008.0 ± 1.9Mean values ± S.E. of kinetic determinations as shown in Fig. 4 b are related to corresponding concentrations of topoisomerase I.Values in column 3 divided by mean specific activity of recombinant human Topoisomerase I (line 1).For abbreviations refer to legend of Fig. 4.Initial kinetics also determined at incubation times of 15 and 30 s.Determined in the presence of 1 mmNa3VO4 to inhibit DNA-topoisomerase II.

Human topoisomerase I is involved in the activation of serine/arginine-rich cofactors of RNA splicing, either by an endogenous protein kinase activity (9Rossi F. Labourier E. Forné T. Divita G. Derancourt J. Riou J. Antoine E. Cathala G. Brunel C. Tazi J. Nature. 1996; 381: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) or by physical association with such an enzyme (21Saalem A. Li X.-G. Wang H.-Y. Fu X.-D. Rubin E. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39 (Abstr. 2541): 373Google Scholar). Here, we report on a direct interaction of topoisomerase I and another RNA-splicing factor. We show that human topoisomerase I binds PSF, an essential cofactor of the second step of RNA splicing (16Patton J.G. Porro E.B. Galceran J. Tempst P. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and is indirectly (via PSF (22Zhang W.-W. Zhang L.-X. Busch R. Farres J. Busch H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Perez I. Jacobs M. Barnard D. Patton J. Eukaryotic mRNA Processing. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 127Google Scholar)) associated with p54, a PSF homolog of unknown function (17Dong B. Horowitz D.S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we show that the PSF/p54 dimer has pronounced stimulatory effect on DNA catalysis by topoisomerase I in vitro. Thus, PSF/p54 could be a regulator of topoisomerase I, independent of and in addition to its functions in RNA splicing. However, because PSF is a well known RNA-splicing factor, it is also tempting to speculate that the observed interaction between topoisomerase I and PSF/p54 reflects a function of topoisomerase I in RNA splicing. In contrast to stimulation of topoisomerase I by histone H1 and high mobility group proteins (11Kordiyak G.J. Jakes S. Ingebritsen T.S. Benbow R.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13484-13491Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which probably reflect an indirect DNA-mediated effect, stimulation of topoisomerase I by PSF/p54 was seen with equimolar complexes of these proteins and could not be significantly increased by further addition of the stimulatory proteins at a 50-fold molar excess. Thus, it seems to be mostly because of a direct protein-protein interaction. As we were not able to separate the native PSF/p54 dimer, we could not directly assess the individual contribution of p54 to this stimulatory effect. We observed that recombinant PSF alone was not as effective as the native PSF/p54 dimer. This could be because of the lack of p54 but could equally well be because of inappropriate folding of the recombinant PSF or lack of posttranslational modifications. It should be noted that endogeneous PSF of A431 cells had a slightly different migration in a SDS gel than recombinant PSF produced in E. coli (Fig. 4 a, lanes 3 and 4). Partial colocalization of PSF and topoisomerase I in interphase nuclei of human A431 cells (Fig. 3, e–g) suggests that complexes of these proteins could assemble in the cell in a manner regulated by compartmentalization. We have not yet obtained direct evidence that such interactions actually serve the regulation of topoisomerase I in a living cell. However, it should be noted that the complete dissociation of topoisomerase I and PSF during early mitosis shown in Fig. 3,a–d, coincides with a 4-fold drop in topoisomerase I activity extractable from mitotic A431 cells (7Meyer K.N.

Quiescent x-ray emission was detected in a 36-kilosecond observation with 31.4 +/- 7.7 x-ray photons, obtained with the Rontgen Satellite (ROSAT), with 9final sigma detection significance. This corresponds to an x-ray luminosity of 2.57 x 10(28) ergs per second and an x-ray to bolometric luminosity ratio of 10(-3.44). These are typical values for late M-type stars. Because the interior of brown dwarfs may be similar to that of convective late-type stars, which are well-known x-ray sources, x-ray emission from brown dwarfs may indicate magnetic activity."

SAPAP is neuronal-specific and tightly attached to the synaptic plasma membranes, and in the transfected cells, SAPAP recruits PSD-95/SAP90 to the plasma membranes. We have subsequently identified a protein interacting with SAPAP and named it S-SCAM (26Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). S-SCAM has five PDZ domains and binds to NMDA receptors and neuroligins. PSD-95/SAP90, SAPAP, and S-SCAM may cooperate to assemble receptors and cell adhesion molecules at the synaptic junctions. In the yeast two-hybrid screening using the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 as bait, we have identified two novel proteins in addition to SAPAP. One of them is ubiquitously expressed, and the other is specifically expressed in brain. In this study, we have characterized this brain-specific protein and named it BEGAIN (brain-enriched guanylate-kinase domain-associated protein). BEGAIN is expressed in neurons and rather enriched at synaptic junctions. BEGAIN may be involved also in the organization of the components of synaptic junctions. Rat brain yeast two-hybrid library was constructed using pVP16 vector and screened (27Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brain cDNA libraries were screened with the [α-32P]dCTP-labeled random-primed probes (27Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various expression vectors were constructed by conventional molecular biology techniques and a polymerase chain reaction method using pBTM116, pBTM116–2, pClneo (Promega), pClneo Myc, pGex5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pGex4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and pGexKG. pBTM116–2 and pClneo Myc were constructed from pBTM116 and pClneo, respectively (26Hirao K.

A rabbit antibody was raised against the product of pGex5X-3 BEGAIN-2-4 and purified (24Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum under 10% CO2 at 37 °C and transfected with DEAE-dextran (24Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A.

COS cells of one 10-cm plate were homogenized in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was diluted with 2 volumes of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, and used as COS cell extracts. 1.5-ml aliquots of the COS cell extracts were incubated with 200 pmol of various glutathione S-transferase (GST) constructs fixed on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. After the beads were washed with Buffer A (20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 33 mm NaCl and 0.33% (w/v) Triton X-100), proteins on the beads were detected with the immunoblottings. CHO cells were transfected with pClneo PSD-95 by a calcium phosphate method using Mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene) and cultured in DMEM with 10% (w/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 40 μg/mll-proline, and 700 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After the three cycles of the subcloning, the cells expressing PSD-95/SAP90 were selected. Crude synaptosomes were prepared from four rat brains (26Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I.

Synaptosomes were homogenized in 16 ml of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 6 m urea and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against 5 liters of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl with one exchange and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to remove the precipitate. 4-ml aliquots of the supernatant were incubated with various antibodies fixed on 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads. After the beads were washed with Buffer A, proteins on the beads were detected with the immunoblottings. CHO cells stably expressing PSD-95/SAP90 were transfected with various eukaryote expression vectors using TransFast Transfection Reagent (Promega). After 48 h, the cells were collected and homogenized in 300 μl of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, by sonication. 80 μl of the homogenates were kept for the analysis, and the remaining samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to separate the supernatant and the pellet. The pellet was homogenized in 220 μl of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to separate the supernatant and the pellet. Other procedures including subcellular fractionation of rat brain, primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, immunocytostaining, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein determination were performed as described (24Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Northern and Western blottings were performed using multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. We performed the yeast two-hybrid screening using the SH3 and GK domains (the residues 430–724) of PSD-95/SAP90 as bait. We obtained six positive clones from 1.4 × 106 clones of a rat brain yeast two-hybrid library. Four clones were SAPAPs. One clone, pPrey1294, was ubiquitously expressed. The full-length clone of this gene encoded a protein composed of 1,822 aa, which was homologous to SPA-1, a GTPase-activating protein for Ran (28Hattori M. Tsukamoto N. Nur-e-Kamai M.S. Rubinfeld B. Iwai K. Kubota H. Maruta H. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The sequence of this gene was submitted to GenBankTMwith an accession number of AF026504. The remaining clone, pPrey1314, was brain-specific. To obtain a full-length clone, we screened two λZAP (Stratagene) and one λgt11 (CLONTECH) rat brain cDNA libraries and obtained 200 positive clones. Two clones, p1314-113 and p1314-196, contained a putative initiation codon and a termination codon. p1314-196 encoded a protein composed of 605 aa (Fig. 1 A). p1314-113 encoded a protein composed of 611 aa. We named these proteins BEGAIN-1 and -2, respectively. The residues 1–8 of BEGAIN-1 and the residues 1–14 of BEGAIN-2 were different, whereas the remaining residues were the same (Fig. 1 B). The sequences around the initiation codons of BEGAIN-1 and -2 were confirmed by the sequencing of three and two independent clones, respectively. To further confirm whether these clones were the full-length ones, COS cell extracts transfected with pClneo BEGAIN-1 and -2 were immunoblotted with the antibody against residues 407–611 of BEGAIN-2. A protein with aM r of 83,000 was detected in the COS cells transfected with pClneo BEGAIN-1, whereas a protein with aM r of 74,000 was detected in the COS cells transfected with pClneo BEGAIN-2 (Fig. 2 A). The reason BEGAIN-1 with 605 aa migrated slower than BEGAIN-2 with 611 aa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is unknown. In the synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) fraction, proteins with M r of 83,000 and 74,000 were detected (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, pClneo BEGAIN-1 and -2 encoded proteins with the same sizes as the native proteins. The software COILS version 2.1 predicted a coiled-coil structure in the N-terminal region of BEGAIN-1. This region showed a weak homology to the repeats of Drosophila CLIP-190, which were also predicted to be coiled-coil regions (29Lantz V.A. Miller K.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Figure 2Expression of BEGAIN.

No message was detected in heart, spleen, lung, liver, kidney, skeletal muscles, or testis. In the subcellular fractionation of rat brain, BEGAIN was detected mainly in the SPM and PSD fractions (Fig. 2 C). To confirm the interaction of BEGAIN with PSD-95/SAP90, BEGAIN was immunoprecipitated from the crude synaptosome fraction. PSD-95/SAP90 was coprecipitated with BEGAIN as well as with SAPAP (Fig. 3 A). To determine the BEGAIN-interacting region of PSD-95/SAP90, the extracts of COS cell expressing Myc-tagged BEGAIN-2 were incubated with GST constructs containing various regions of PSD-95/SAP90. The GK domain interacted with BEGAIN, whereas the PDZ and SH3 domains did not (Fig. 3 B). The same results were obtained using BEGAIN-1 (data not shown). The GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with BEGAIN. In rat hippocampal neurons, BEGAIN showed a somatodendritic pattern and was colocalized with PSD-95/SAP90 (Fig. 3 C), whereas the staining of GABAA receptor did not overlap with that of BEGAIN (data not shown). These findings suggest that BEGAIN is localized at the excitatory synapses and interacts with PSD-95/SAP90 in vivo. The region of BEGAIN involved in the interaction with PSD-95/SAP90 was estimated from the following observations. The clone pPrey1314 obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening contained residues 524–605 of BEGAIN-1 (Fig. 1 A, underlined). In the reverse yeast two-hybrid screening using residues 495–605 of BEGAIN-1 as bait, three positive clones were obtained. These clones all contained the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 (residues 158–724, 354–724, and 508–724, respectively). Therefore, the C-terminal region of BEGAIN is sufficient for the interaction with PSD-95/SAP90. To test the interactions of BEGAIN with other MAGUKs, β-galactosidase assay was performed using the prey clone of BEGAIN and various baits. PSD-95/SAP90, SAP97, and Drosophila dlg-A interacted with BEGAIN, whereas p55, ZO-1, or CASK did not (Table I). Although the interaction of BEGAIN with PSD-95/SAP90 was much weaker than that of SAPAP with PSD-95/SAP90, these results suggest that BEGAIN specifically interacts with PSD-95/SAP90 and its isoforms.Table IInteraction of BEGAIN with MAGUKsControl (pVP16)pPrey1314 (BEGAIN)pPrey1201 (SAPAP1)Control (pBTM116)<10<10<10Constructs with the SH3 and GK domains pBTM116 PSD-95–3<103.51 × 102 ± 161.63 × 104 ± 440 pBTM116 SAP97–5<101.58 × 103 ± 262.65 × 104 ± 499 pBTM116 p55–1<10<10<10 pBTM116 CASK-11<10<10<10 pBTM116 ZO1–1<10<10<10Constructs with the GK domain pBTM116 PSD-95–9<101.00 × 102 ± 101.40 × 104 ± 81 pBTM116 dlg-2<105.93 × 102 ± 111.40 × 104 ± 164 pBTM116 CASK-10<10<10<10Construct with the SH3 domain pBTM116 PSD-95–11<10<10<10Data list β-galactosidase activities of yeasts harboring the respective bait and prey plasmids. pPrey1314 and pPrey1201 contain the residues 524–605 of BEGAIN-1 and 315–556 of SAPAP1, respectively.

Data shown are nanomoles of substrate hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein ± S.D. Because BEGAIN and SAPAP interact with the same region of PSD-95/SAP90, BEGAIN and SAPAP may compete for the binding to PSD-95/SAP90 and cannot interact with PSD-95/SAP90 simultaneously. If this is the case, BEGAIN cannot participate in the core complex formation of PSD-95/SAP90 and SAPAP in the PSD. PSD-95/SAP90 is multimerized through the disulfide-linkage at the N terminus (30Hsueh Y-P Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, PSD-95/SAP90 binding BEGAIN may interact with another PSD-95/SAP90 binding SAPAP. If such interactions take place in vivo, BEGAIN can be a component of the core complex of PSD-95/SAP90 and SAPAP. In the transfected HEK293 cells, PSD-95/SAP90 is translocated from the cytosol to the membrane in the presence of SAPAP (24Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We have confirmed this observation using the CHO cells stably expressing PSD-95/SAP90 (CHO/PSD-95 cells). In CHO/PSD-95 cells, PSD-95/SAP90 was distributed in the cytosol and membrane fractions and was solubilized in the Triton X-100 extraction (Fig. 4 A). When SAPAP was transfected in these cells, SAPAP was distributed in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, and PSD-95/SAP90 was recruited into the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig. 4 B). BEGAIN was distributed in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction and did not affect the distribution of PSD-95/SAP90 (Fig. 4 C). When BEGAIN and SAPAP were coexpressed in CHO/PSD-95 cells, BEGAIN was recruited into the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction with PSD-95/SAP90 (Fig. 4 D). When BEGAIN and SAPAP were coexpressed in the wild CHO cells, BEGAIN remained in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction (Fig. 4 E). These findings suggest that BEGAIN binds to SAPAP via PSD-95/SAP90 and forms a ternary complex in vivo. The PSD provides the scaffolds for the molecules involved in the neurotransmissions and the synaptic plasticity (reviewed in Refs. 3Kennedy M.B. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 264-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar and 31Ziff E.B. Cell. 1997; 19: 1163-1174Google Scholar). The PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as PSD-95/SAP90, GRIP, and S-SCAM, play central roles in the formation of the scaffolds (reviewed in Refs. 4Craven S.E. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 495-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 5Hata, Y., Nakanishi, H., and Takai, Y. (1998) Neurosci. Res., in pressGoogle Scholar, and 16Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, other molecules are also required to form the PSD. SAPAP is tightly attached to the PSD and recruits PSD-95/SAP90 to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in the transfected cells. Here we have reported a novel protein enriched in the PSD fraction, BEGAIN. The interaction of BEGAIN with PSD-95/SAP90 has been shown through the yeast two-hybrid method, affinity column chromatography, and coimmunoprecipitation from rat brains. BEGAIN is colocalized with PSD-95/SAP90 in rat hippocampal neurons, suggesting that BEGAIN actually binds to PSD-95/SAP90 in vivo. The sequence of BEGAIN has no significant homology to known proteins. The C-terminal region of BEGAIN is involved in the interaction with PSD-95/SAP90. The N-terminal region of BEGAIN has a coiled-coil structure, and BEGAIN may interact with molecules other than PSD-95/SAP90 through this region. In the transfected cells, BEGAIN itself is distributed in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction in contrast to SAPAP. SAPAP recruits BEGAIN via PSD-95/SAP90 into the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Although the subcellular localization of BEGAIN remains to be clear, these findings suggest that BEGAIN is a component of the PSD, binds to the core complex of PSD-95/SAP90 and SAPAP, and may sustain the structure of the PSD."

Here, we show that alternate promoter usage gives rise to distinct stable and unstable RNA isoforms. Unstable Xist transcript initiates at a novel upstream promoter, whereas stable Xist RNA is transcribed from the previously identified promoter and from a novel downstream promoter. Analysis of cells undergoing X inactivation indicates that a developmentally regulated promoter switch mediates stabilization and accumulation of Xist RNA on the inactive X chromosome."

The T cell receptor (TCR)1 is a multimeric receptor composed of the ligand binding Tiαβ dimer and the signal transducing subunits CD3γε and CD3δε and the TCRζζ dimer (1Ashwell J.D. Klausner R.D.

Only completely assembled octameric TiαβCD3γεδεζζ complexes are efficiently expressed at the cell surface of mature T cells to ensure proper TCR functions. Thus, very selective mechanisms that only allow expression of completely assembled and functional TCR must exist in T cells. Several studies have indicated that the TCRζ chain plays important roles in such mechanisms. Thus, the TCR is not or is only very weakly expressed at the cell surface of T cells from TCRζ knock-out mice and in the TCRζ-deficient T cell variant MA 5.8 (3Love P.E. Shores E.W.

Thus, the selective expression of only completely assembled TCR at the T cell surface seems to be ensured by the TCRζ chain (11Weissman A.M. Frank S.J. Orloff D.G. Mercep M. Ashwell J.D. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3651-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,12Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1990; 36: 31-51Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, it still remains to be explained how the TCRζ chain redirects the sorting of incomplete TCR from a degradative pathway to the cell surface. The observation that incompletely assembled TCR complexes are sorted to a degradative compartment and not expressed at the cell surface suggests that receptor-sorting motifs with the capacity to sort receptors to the lysosomes must be active in incomplete TCR (6Sussman J.J. Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A.M. Saito T. Klausner R.D. Ashwell J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We and others have recently described a leucine-based (L-based) receptor-sorting motif (S126DKQTLL132) in the cytoplasmic tail of CD3γ (13Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 14Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.-M.K. Geisler C.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). When active, the L-based motif is recognized and bound by clathrin-coated vesicle adaptor proteins either at the trans-Golgi network or at the plasma membrane (15Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Nielsen B.L. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 16Bremnes T. Lauvrak V. Lindqvist B. Bakke O. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This leads to sorting of receptors to the lysosomes and to rapid receptor internalization, respectively. In completely assembled TCR, the CD3γ L-based motif is inactive and not accessible for adaptor proteins unless phosphorylated (14Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.-M.K. Geisler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast, in chimeric Tac/CD3γ and CD4/CD3γ molecules, the motif is constitutively active independently of phosphorylation, and like hexameric TiαβCD3γεδε complexes, these chimeras are rapidly transported to the lysosomes for degradation (6Sussman J.J. Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A.M. Saito T. Klausner R.D. Ashwell J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 13Letourneur F. Klausner R.D.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). From these observations it may be suggested that the CD3γ L-based motif is active in incompletely assembled TCR and that TCRζ allows cell surface expression of completely assembled TiαβCD3γεδεζζ complexes by masking this motif. In this study, we addressed the question whether TCRζ has the potential to mask the CD3γ leucine-based motif. By analyzing receptor expression and sorting of mutated TCR and chimeric CD4/CD3γ and CD16/CD3γ molecules, we found that similar to the TCR, the CD16/CD3γ chimera was stably expressed at the cell surface in association with TCRζ. Furthermore, both the TCR and the CD16/CD3γ-TCRζ complexes had low spontaneous internalization rates indicating that the CD3γ L-based motif in these multimeric complexes was inactive. As is true for the TCR, the CD3γ L-based motif in the CD16/CD3γ-TCRζ complexes was activated following protein kinase C (PKC) activation, which resulted in a rapid internalization of the complexes from the cell surface. In contrast, the CD4/CD3γ chimera did not associate with the TCRζ chain and the CD3γ L-based motif in these chimeras was constitutively active resulting in a high spontaneous internalization rate and low cell surface expression of the chimera. Thus, our data demonstrate that the TCRζ chain allows stable cell surface expression of receptors containing a CD3γ L-based motif most probably by masking this motif. JGN, a TCR cell surface negative variant of the human T cell line Jurkat that synthesizes no CD3γ, was produced in our own laboratory (10Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin 2 × 105units/liter (Leo Pharmaceutical Products, Ballerup, Denmark), streptomycin 50 mg/liter (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and 10% (v/v) FCS (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated and purified mouse anti-human CD3ε (UCHT1), rat anti-mouse CD4 (L3T4), and mouse anti-human CD16 (3G8) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Mouse anti-human TCRζ mAb (6B10.2) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulin and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin were from Dakopatts A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). The phorbol-ester phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) was from Sigma. The truncated CD3γ and the chimeric CD4/CD3γ and CD16/CD3γ molecules were constructed as described previously (14Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.-M.K. Geisler C.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), pCD-L3T4.25 (20Littman D.R. Gettner S.N. Nature. 1987; 325: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), or FcγRIII-2 (21Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) as templates. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfections were performed using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at a setting of 270 V and 960 microfarad with 40 μg of plasmid/2 × 107 cells. After 3–4 weeks of selection, G418-resistant clones were expanded and maintained in medium without G418. Western blotting was performed as described previously (22Hou X. Dietrich J. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22815-22822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine the spontaneous internalization rates, cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS at a cell density of 2 × 105 cells/ml at 37 °C or 4 °C with PE-conjugated anti-CD3ε, anti-CD16, or anti-CD4 mAb. At the time indicated, aliquots of cell suspension were washed in ice-cold RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS, divided in two equal parts, and subsequently treated with 300 μl of 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5m acetic acid, pH 2.2, for 10 s or left untreated. The fluorescence of the cells was measured by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The percentage of internalized mAb to cell surface bound mAb was subsequently calculated using the equation: ((HAR −CAR)/CT) × 100%, where HAR is the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of acid-treated cells incubated at 37 °C, CAR is the MFI of acid treated cells incubated at 4 °C, and CT is the MFI of untreated cells incubated at 4 °C. For each construct at least three different clones were analyzed. For PKC-induced receptor internalization, cells were adjusted to 2 × 105 cells/ml medium (RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS) and incubated at 37 °C with various concentrations of the phorbol ester PDB. At the time indicated, cells were transferred to ice-cold PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.1% NaN3 and washed twice. The cells were stained directly with PE-conjugated anti-CD3ε or anti-CD16 mAb and analyzed by flow cytometry. MFI was recorded and used in the calculation of percent mAb binding: (MFI of phorbol ester treated cells) divided by (MFI of untreated cells) × 100%. For each construct at least three different clones were analyzed. We and others have previously demonstrated that the CD3γ L-based motif is constitutively active in chimeric CD4/CD3γ and Tac/CD3γ molecules independently of phosphorylation (13Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 15Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Nielsen B.L. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The active L-based motif results in very low expression of these chimeras at the cell surface. To determine whether the TCRζ chain had the potential to mask the CD3γ L-based motif and thereby allow stable receptor cell surface expression, we took advantage of the observation that the Fc receptor FcγRIIIA-α chain (CD16) is only expressed at the cell surface of Jurkat cells in association with TCRζ (23Ravetch J.V. Kinet J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). In contrast to CD16, CD4 is expressed as a monomer at the cell surface (24Parnes J.R. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 44: 265-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). By comparing chimeric CD4/CD3γ and CD16/CD3γ molecules either with or without an intact CD3γ L-based motif, this enabled us specifically to examine if and how the TCRζ chain influenced the activity of the CD3γ L-based motif. Six different constructs were made. CD3γ-tS126 and CD3γ-tP133 coded for the CD3γ chain with a truncated cytoplasmic tail immediately before and after the L-based motif, respectively. CD4/CD3γ-tS126 and CD4/CD3γ-tP133 coded for chimeric molecules composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD4 and the cytoplasmic tail of CD3γ truncated immediately before and after the L-based motif, respectively. CD16/CD3γ-tS126 and CD16/CD3γ-tP133 coded for chimeric molecules composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD16 and the cytoplasmic tail of CD3γ truncated immediately before and after the L-based motif, respectively (Fig. 1 A). These constructs were separately transfected into the CD3γ negative Jurkat variant JGN (10Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar) and G418-resistant transfectants were tested for cell surface expression of the transfected molecules by FACS analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the TCR and the CD16/CD3γ chimera were all highly expressed at the cell surface independent of the presence or absence of the CD3γ L-based motif. In agreement with previous studies, the CD4/CD3γ-tS126 chimera was highly expressed, whereas the CD4/CD3γ-tP133 chimera with an active CD3γ L-based motif was only weakly expressed at the cell surface although highly expressed intracellularly (Fig. 1 B and data not shown) (15Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Nielsen B.L. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To analyze whether the chimeras actually associated with TCRζ, cells were lysed in digitonin lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with either anti-CD4 or anti-CD16 mAb. The precipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blot analysis was performed using the anti-TCRζ mAb. As shown in Fig. 1 C, TCRζ clearly co-precipitated with the CD16/CD3γ chimeras but did not co-precipitate with the CD4/CD3γ chimeras. These experiments demonstrated that in the absence of the CD3γ L-based motif both the TCR, the CD4/CD3γ, and the CD16/CD3γ chimeras were highly expressed at the cell surface independent of their capacity to associate with TCRζ. In contrast, in the presence of an intact CD3γ L-based motif only molecules capable of forming association with TCRζ were expressed at the cell surface. Because the CD4/CD3γ-tP133 and CD16/CD3γ-tP133 chimeras had identical cytoplasmic tails with an intact CD3γ L-based motif and only differed intracellularly by their ability to associate with the TCRζ chain, these observations suggested that TCRζ masked and thereby inactivated the CD3γ L-based motif of the CD16/CD3γ-tP133 chimera. We have previously demonstrated that CD4/CD3γ chimeras with an inactive CD3γ L-based motif have low spontaneous internalization rates and are highly expressed at the cell surface, whereas CD4/CD3γ chimeras with an active CD3γ L-based motif have high spontaneous internalization rates and are weakly expressed at the cell surface (15Dietrich J. Kastrup J. Nielsen B.L. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To analyze whether the CD3γ L-based motif in the CD16/CD3γ-tP133-TCRζ complex was active at the cell surface, the spontaneous internalization rate was determined. As expected, the CD4/CD3γ-tP133 chimera had a high spontaneous internalization rate reflecting the active CD3γ L-based motif present in this chimera, and the TCR-tP133 had a low spontaneous internalization rate reflecting the inactive CD3γ L-based motif in the completely assembled TCR. Like the TCR-tP133, the CD16/CD3γ-tP133-TCRζ complex had a low spontaneous internalization rate, indicating that the CD3γ L-based motif in the CD16/CD3γ-tP133-TCRζ complex was inactive (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, the CD4/CD3γ-tS126 that did not contain the CD3γ L-based motif had a low spontaneous internalization rate. Following PKC-induced phosphorylation the CD3γ L-based motif in the context of the TCR is activated. This results in an increased internalization rate and a down-regulation of the TCR from the cell surface (14Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.-M.K. Geisler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 25Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.-M.K. Pedersen L.O. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11441-11448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To analyze whether the CD3γ L-based motif in the CD16/CD3γ-tP133-TCRζ complex could be activated following PKC activation, cells were treated with the phorbol ester PDB and subsequently analyzed for receptor expression. Interestingly, similar to the TCR-tP133, the CD16/CD3γ-tP133-TCRζ complex was down-regulated from the cell surface following PKC activation (Fig. 2 B). An approximately 5-fold higher PBD concentration was required to induce down-regulation of the CD16/CD3γ-tP133-TCRζ complex as compared with the TCR, which might indicate that the CD3γ L-based motif was not as accessible for PKC in the CD16/CD3γ-tP133-TCRζ complex as in the TCR-tP133. Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that the CD3γ L-based motif is constitutively active in monomeric CD4/CD3γ-tP133 chimeras but inactive in CD16/CD3γ-tP133-TCRζ complexes. Furthermore, as seen for the CD3γ L-based motif in the TCR, the CD3γ L-based motif in the CD16/CD3γ-tP133-TCRζ complex was activated following phosphorylation. These observations strongly indicated that the TCRζ chain allows stable cell surface expression of receptors containing CD3γ L-based motifs by masking this motif and that phosphorylation directly influences the interaction between CD3γ and TCRζ in both TCR and CD16/CD3γ-TCRζ complexes. Previous studies have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tails of Tiα, Tiβ, CD3γ, CD3δ, and CD3ε are dispensable for TCR expression (18Dietrich J. Neisig A. Hou X. Wegener A.-M.K. Gajhede M.

Thus, neither of these chains seems to be involved in masking any potential internalization/degradation motifs in the TCR. In contrast, to our knowledge the shortest TCRζ chain that allows TCR cell surface expression previously published contained a cytoplasmic tail of 26 amino acids (29Moingeon P. Lucich J.L. McConkey D.J. Letourneur F. Malissen B. Kochan J. Chang H.C. Rodewald H.R. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While the location of linker histones on the nucleosome has attracted considerable research effort, only a few studies have addressed the location of HMG1 in the particles. In this study, we use a procedure based on micrococcal nuclease digestion of reconstituted nucleosomal particles to which HMG1 has been bound, followed by analysis of the protected DNA by restriction nuclease digestion, to locate the HMG1 binding site. Nucleosomal particles were reconstituted on a 235-base pair DNA fragment, which is known to be a strong nucleosome positioning sequence. The results unequivocally show that HMG1 protects linker DNA on one side of the core particle. Importantly, and possibly of physiological relevance, the linker DNA site protected by HMG1 was located on the side opposite to that already shown to be protected by linker histone binding.

Linker histones (H1, H5, and its cognates) and the non-histone chromatin proteins HMG1 and HMG2 are the major proteins that bind to linker DNA between successive nucleosomes in the chromatin fiber (for recent reviews, See Refs. 1Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 54: 35-100Crossref Google Scholar, 3Wolffe A.P. Khochbin S.

The two proteins are believed to play roles in transcription regulation, the conventional view being that linker histones are general repressors of transcription, whereas HMG1/2 are considered general enhancers. Recent research shows that the situation is much more complex, and both proteins have been implicated in both positive and negative regulatory pathways (1Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 54: 35-100Crossref Google Scholar, 3Wolffe A.P. Khochbin S.

Exactly how the linker DNA binding proteins exert their regulatory function in transcription remains an enigma (e.g. Ref. 5Zlatanova J. van Holde K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They may do so by affecting higher order chromatin structure; in addition, they may act at the level of individual nucleosomes, by creating particles of different stabilities and, hence, different accessibility to binding of general and gene-specific transcription factors.The location of linker histones on the nucleosome has been studied for years, albeit with contradictory results (6Crane-Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 75-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recent studies performed on nucleosomes reconstituted on specific DNA fragments seem to indicate that the linker histone binds highly asymmetrically to the core particle, protecting linker DNA on only one side of the particle (7Wong J. Li O. Levi B.-Z. Shi Y.-B. Wolffe A. EMBO J. 1997; 23: 7130-7145Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8An W. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3668-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The choice between two alternative binding sites is probably dictated by DNA sequences in the linker region (8An W. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The location of HMG1, on the other hand, has been so far studied on reconstitutes on only one DNA sequence, the 5 S rDNA from Xenopus borealis(10Nightingale K. Dimitrov S. Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this specific case, it was reported that HMG1 interacts with linker DNA in the same way as does histone H1, protecting ∼5 bp1 on one side of the nucleosome core and ∼15 bp on the other side (10Nightingale K. Dimitrov S. Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated recently that X. borealis 5 S DNA sequence is not suited for studies involving micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion, since results interpreted as “protection” by linker DNA-binding proteins could be obtained with naked DNA and with reconstituted core nucleosomes, in the absence of linker proteins (12An W. van Holde K.E. Zlatanova J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4042-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Realizing that the reported 5/15 bp protection by HMG1 (10Nightingale K. Dimitrov S. Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) could stem from the same artifact, we decided to investigate linker DNA protection by HMG1 on mononucleosomal particles reconstituted on an alternative nucleosome positioning sequence not prone to such artifacts. We have chosen to use a DNA fragment that carries the binding sites for Gal4 and USF (13Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment gives clear-cut results in the MNase-based protection assay, since it places the histone octamer in one major translational position (8An W. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MNase digestion of the naked DNA fragment used for reconstitution does not produce fragments of lengths obtained in digestion of the reconstitutes, which may obscure the analysis. Finally, the HMG1 protection results can be directly compared with results concerning linker histone protection on particles reconstituted on the same sequence (8An W. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study the protection against MNase cleavage on nucleosomal DNA provided by HMG1 binding, we used the protocol introduced by Donget al.

Briefly, the reconstituted nucleosomal particles were digested with MNase to cleave off portions of linker DNA that were not protected by interaction with proteins. The proteins were then removed by proteinase K digestion, the protected DNA fragments of desirable lengths were purified from polyacrylamide electrophoretic gels, end-labeled, and further subjected to restriction nuclease digestion. The lengths of the resulting restriction fragments were determined in sequencing gels and used to deduce the location of the histone octamer on the sequence and the protection of linker DNA by HMG1 (for a schematic, see Fig. 3 C).The success of reconstitution was followed by gel retardation assays of the kind shown in Fig. 1. Addition of the histone octamer to the 235-bp pGUB fragment led to the appearance of a retarded band, reflecting the formation of a core nucleosome on the DNA fragment (the core nucleosome differs from a core particle by the presence of “linker” DNA on both its sides). Further addition of HMG1 to the core nucleosome led to the formation of a particle, which was further retarded on the gel. MNase digestion of this mixture (lane 4, Fig. 1), the core nucleosome/DNA mixture (lane 2), and of naked DNA as a control, reproducibly produced DNA patterns such as those shown in Fig. 2, A, B, and C, respectively.Figure 1Reconstitution of DNA into core nucleosomes and HMG1-containing nucleosomal particles as visualized by the band shift assay.

Note the persistence of fragments of 146 bp in length in A and B (marked as core) and of a fragment of ∼170 bp in A. These were the DNA bands subjected to further analysis. The smeared band around 160 bp that is often present in the HMG1/core nucleosome digests has also been analyzed by sequencing gels, but it showed a pattern totally unrelated to the pattern produced by the 146-bp core particle fragment (not shown). For example, neither of the core particle boundaries could be seen; thus this fragment must arise from cleavages elsewhere on the 235-bp fragment and was not considered as resulting from further protection imposed on the core particle by bound HMG1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Digestion of the core nucleosome preparation revealed the expected kinetic pause of digestion at 146 bp (Fig. 2 A), which results from DNA protection by the histone octamer. The DNA patterns resulting from digestion of the HMG1/core nucleosome reconstitute contained, in addition to the core particle DNA band, an additional band of lower stability at ∼168–170 bp. Finally, digestion of naked DNA, even under milder conditions, did not produce any DNA bands of 146 and 170 bp length (Fig. 2 C). It must be emphasized that the small amount of free DNA present in the reconstituted particle preparations will not in any event contribute to the patterns observed with these particles, since under the conditions of digestion used to obtain DNA from these particles naked DNA is completely digested to small fragments unobservable on gels.The 146-bp DNA bands from both the core nucleosome and the HMG1/core nucleosome MNase digests, as well as the ∼170-bp band from the HMG1/core particle preparation, were further subjected toXhoI restriction nuclease digestion, and the lengths of the resulting fragments were determined by sequencing gels (Fig. 3 A). In accordance with published data (13Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and our previous results (8An W. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the GUB sequence placed the histone octamer in one major translational position, defined by DNA fragments 108 and 39 bases in length. Moreover, the same major core particle position was present in the core nucleosome (not shown) and in the HMG1/core nucleosome reconstitute (Fig. 3 A, lane 2).The pattern of XhoI cleavage of the ∼170-bp band in the MNase digestion pattern of the HMG1/core nucleosome reconstitute revealed two major bands, 132 and 39 bases in length. Since the 3′ border of the protein-protected region was the same as in the core particle, and the 5′ border was shifted 24 bp in the 5′ direction, HMG1 must protect linker DNA on only one side of the core particle (see Fig. 3 C). This result is at variance with the result obtained with the X. borealis 5 S rDNA (10Nightingale K. Dimitrov S. Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); the latter result may be due to the artifacts connected to the use of the 5 S gene sequence for MNase-based assays of protein protection. We have been able to observe the cleavages corresponding to 5/15 bp protection reported previously (10Nightingale K. Dimitrov S. Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4042-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).To interpret such data unambiguously, we must eliminate the possibility that HMG1 causes a short range shift of the position of the histone octamer along the DNA fragment. If such a shift were to take place, then the 132/29 pattern obtained upon XboI cleavage could reflect a 24-bp shift of the core in the 5′ direction and protection of the same length of DNA of (now linker) DNA at the 3′ end by HMG1. To exclude such a possibility, the analysis was repeated after cross-linking the protein to the DNA following the reconstitution of the core nucleosome, but before addition of HMG1. The results obtained on the cross-linked material were indistinguishable from those presented above (compare Fig. 3 A with Fig. 3 B). This observation reinforces the interpretation presented in Fig. 3 C.The results of these experiments indicate that HMG1 bound to the core nucleosome protects linker DNA on only one side of the core particle. Interestingly, and potentially of physiological relevance, linker histone protects linker DNA on the opposite side of the core particle reconstituted on the same sequence (8An W. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although our data provide no information on in vivo binding, this issue may be directly related to the possibility of the two proteins competing for binding at the nucleosome, with all ensuing structural and function consequences of such a competition (for a detailed discussion, see Ref. 1Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Indeed, early evidence that chromatosome-sized units containing either H1 or HMG1 could be isolated from MNase digests of whole chromatin (18Jackson J.B. Pollock Jr., J.M. Rill R.L. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3739-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Jackson J.B. Rill R.L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) would argue indirectly that the binding of the two classes of linker proteins might be mutually exclusive, and the two proteins might compete with each other for binding to the nucleosome. That the two proteins compete for binding to four-way junction DNA (20Varga-Weisz P. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1904-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Hill D.A. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3523-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or cisplatin-modified DNA (22Yaneva J. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13448-13451Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) has been demonstrated recently. Preliminary experiments in our laboratory show that this may also be the case for reconstituted nucleosomes. 2W. An, S. H. Leuba, K. van Holde, and J. Zlatanova, manuscript in preparation.It should be emphasized that even though the two protected regions are on “opposite ends” of the nucleosomal DNA, those ends are probably closely juxtaposed in the nucleosome, and thus competition or mutual exclusion is still possible. The resolution of this important issue and its relation to transcriptional regulation will require in situ studies addressing the question of whether the transition between transcriptionally active and inactive state of specific gene regions is accompanied by mutual replacement of the two protein classes. Linker histones (H1, H5, and its cognates) and the non-histone chromatin proteins HMG1 and HMG2 are the major proteins that bind to linker DNA between successive nucleosomes in the chromatin fiber (for recent reviews, See Refs. 1Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 54: 35-100Crossref Google Scholar, 3Wolffe A.P. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 4Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 217-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two proteins are believed to play roles in transcription regulation, the conventional view being that linker histones are general repressors of transcription, whereas HMG1/2 are considered general enhancers. Recent research shows that the situation is much more complex, and both proteins have been implicated in both positive and negative regulatory pathways (1Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 54: 35-100Crossref Google Scholar, 3Wolffe A.P. Khochbin S.

Exactly how the linker DNA binding proteins exert their regulatory function in transcription remains an enigma (e.g. Ref. 5Zlatanova J. van Holde K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They may do so by affecting higher order chromatin structure; in addition, they may act at the level of individual nucleosomes, by creating particles of different stabilities and, hence, different accessibility to binding of general and gene-specific transcription factors. The location of linker histones on the nucleosome has been studied for years, albeit with contradictory results (6Crane-Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 75-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recent studies performed on nucleosomes reconstituted on specific DNA fragments seem to indicate that the linker histone binds highly asymmetrically to the core particle, protecting linker DNA on only one side of the particle (7Wong J. Li O. Levi B.-Z. Shi Y.-B. Wolffe A. EMBO J. 1997; 23: 7130-7145Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8An W. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3668-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The choice between two alternative binding sites is probably dictated by DNA sequences in the linker region (8An W. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The location of HMG1, on the other hand, has been so far studied on reconstitutes on only one DNA sequence, the 5 S rDNA from Xenopus borealis(10Nightingale K. Dimitrov S. Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this specific case, it was reported that HMG1 interacts with linker DNA in the same way as does histone H1, protecting ∼5 bp1 on one side of the nucleosome core and ∼15 bp on the other side (10Nightingale K. Dimitrov S. Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently that X. borealis 5 S DNA sequence is not suited for studies involving micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion, since results interpreted as “protection” by linker DNA-binding proteins could be obtained with naked DNA and with reconstituted core nucleosomes, in the absence of linker proteins (12An W. van Holde K.E. Zlatanova J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4042-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Realizing that the reported 5/15 bp protection by HMG1 (10Nightingale K. Dimitrov S. Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 548-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) could stem from the same artifact, we decided to investigate linker DNA protection by HMG1 on mononucleosomal particles reconstituted on an alternative nucleosome positioning sequence not prone to such artifacts. We have chosen to use a DNA fragment that carries the binding sites for Gal4 and USF (13Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment gives clear-cut results in the MNase-based protection assay, since it places the histone octamer in one major translational position (8An W. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MNase digestion of the naked DNA fragment used for reconstitution does not produce fragments of lengths obtained in digestion of the reconstitutes, which may obscure the analysis. Finally, the HMG1 protection results can be directly compared with results concerning linker histone protection on particles reconstituted on the same sequence (8An W. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study the protection against MNase cleavage on nucleosomal DNA provided by HMG1 binding, we used the protocol introduced by Donget al. (17Dong F. Hansen J.C. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5724-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and later applied by other investigators in the field. Briefly, the reconstituted nucleosomal particles were digested with MNase to cleave off portions of linker DNA that were not protected by interaction with proteins. The proteins were then removed by proteinase K digestion, the protected DNA fragments of desirable lengths were purified from polyacrylamide electrophoretic gels, end-labeled, and further subjected to restriction nuclease digestion. The lengths of the resulting restriction fragments were determined in sequencing gels and used to deduce the location of the histone octamer on the sequence and the protection of linker DNA by HMG1 (for a schematic, see Fig. 3 C).The success of reconstitution was followed by gel retardation assays of the kind shown in Fig. 1. Addition of the histone octamer to the 235-bp pGUB fragment led to the appearance of a retarded band, reflecting the formation of a core nucleosome on the DNA fragment (the core nucleosome differs from a core particle by the presence of “linker” DNA on both its sides). Further addition of HMG1 to the core nucleosome led to the formation of a particle, which was further retarded on the gel. MNase digestion of this mixture (lane 4, Fig. 1), the core nucleosome/DNA mixture (lane 2), and of naked DNA as a control, reproducibly produced DNA patterns such as those shown in Fig. 2, A, B, and C, respectively.Figure 2Products of MNase digestion of the HMG1/core nucleosome reconstitute (A), the core nucleosome (B), and the naked DNA fragment used for reconstitutions (C).

MNase digestion of this mixture (lane 4, Fig. 1), the core nucleosome/DNA mixture (lane 2), and of naked DNA as a control, reproducibly produced DNA patterns such as those shown in Fig. 2, A, B, and C, respectively. Digestion of the core nucleosome preparation revealed the expected kinetic pause of digestion at 146 bp (Fig. 2 A), which results from DNA protection by the histone octamer. The DNA patterns resulting from digestion of the HMG1/core nucleosome reconstitute contained, in addition to the core particle DNA band, an additional band of lower stability at ∼168–170 bp. Finally, digestion of naked DNA, even under milder conditions, did not produce any DNA bands of 146 and 170 bp length (Fig. 2 C). It must be emphasized that the small amount of free DNA present in the reconstituted particle preparations will not in any event contribute to the patterns observed with these particles, since under the conditions of digestion used to obtain DNA from these particles naked DNA is completely digested to small fragments unobservable on gels. The 146-bp DNA bands from both the core nucleosome and the HMG1/core nucleosome MNase digests, as well as the ∼170-bp band from the HMG1/core particle preparation, were further subjected toXhoI restriction nuclease digestion, and the lengths of the resulting fragments were determined by sequencing gels (Fig. 3 A).

Moreover, the same major core particle position was present in the core nucleosome (not shown) and in the HMG1/core nucleosome reconstitute (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). The pattern of XhoI cleavage of the ∼170-bp band in the MNase digestion pattern of the HMG1/core nucleosome reconstitute revealed two major bands, 132 and 39 bases in length. Since the 3′ border of the protein-protected region was the same as in the core particle, and the 5′ border was shifted 24 bp in the 5′ direction, HMG1 must protect linker DNA on only one side of the core particle (see Fig. 3 C).

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) upon digestion of free DNA or core particles (12An W. van Holde K.E. Zlatanova J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4042-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To interpret such data unambiguously, we must eliminate the possibility that HMG1 causes a short range shift of the position of the histone octamer along the DNA fragment. If such a shift were to take place, then the 132/29 pattern obtained upon XboI cleavage could reflect a 24-bp shift of the core in the 5′ direction and protection of the same length of DNA of (now linker) DNA at the 3′ end by HMG1. To exclude such a possibility, the analysis was repeated after cross-linking the protein to the DNA following the reconstitution of the core nucleosome, but before addition of HMG1. The results obtained on the cross-linked material were indistinguishable from those presented above (compare Fig. 3 A with Fig. 3 B). This observation reinforces the interpretation presented in Fig. 3 C. The results of these experiments indicate that HMG1 bound to the core nucleosome protects linker DNA on only one side of the core particle. Interestingly, and potentially of physiological relevance, linker histone protects linker DNA on the opposite side of the core particle reconstituted on the same sequence (8An W. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although our data provide no information on in vivo binding, this issue may be directly related to the possibility of the two proteins competing for binding at the nucleosome, with all ensuing structural and function consequences of such a competition (for a detailed discussion, see Ref. 1Zlatanova J. van Holde K. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Indeed, early evidence that chromatosome-sized units containing either H1 or HMG1 could be isolated from MNase digests of whole chromatin (18Jackson J.B. Pollock Jr., J.M. Rill R.L. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3739-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Jackson J.B. Rill R.L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) would argue indirectly that the binding of the two classes of linker proteins might be mutually exclusive, and the two proteins might compete with each other for binding to the nucleosome. That the two proteins compete for binding to four-way junction DNA (20Varga-Weisz P. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1904-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Hill D.A. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3523-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or cisplatin-modified DNA (22Yaneva J. Leuba S.H. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13448-13451Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) has been demonstrated recently. Preliminary experiments in our laboratory show that this may also be the case for reconstituted nucleosomes. 2W. An, S. H. Leuba, K. van Holde, and J. Zlatanova, manuscript in preparation.It should be emphasized that even though the two protected regions are on “opposite ends” of the nucleosomal DNA, those ends are probably closely juxtaposed in the nucleosome, and thus competition or mutual exclusion is still possible. The resolution of this important issue and its relation to transcriptional regulation will require in situ studies addressing the question of whether the transition between transcriptionally active and inactive state of specific gene regions is accompanied by mutual replacement of the two protein classes. We are indebted to Dr. J. L. Workman for providing plasmids pGUB and to Dr. S. Leuba for purifying the histone octamer."

In this study we provide evidence that glycosylasparaginase (aspartylglucosaminidase), an N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond in glycoproteins, catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-aspartyl peptides to form l-aspartic acid and amino acids or peptides. The enzyme also effectively catalyzes the synthesis of β-aspartyl peptides by transferring the β-aspartyl moiety from other β-aspartyl peptides or β-aspartylglycosylamine to a variety of amino acids and peptides. Furthermore, the enzyme can usel-asparagine as the β-aspartyl donor in the formation of β-aspartyl peptides. The data show that synthesis and degradation of β-aspartyl peptides are new, significant functions of glycosylasparaginase and suggest that the enzyme could have an important role in the metabolism of β-aspartyl peptides. β-Aspartyl di- and tripeptides are common constituents of mammalian metabolism, but their formation and catabolism are not fully understood.

Chem. 1961; 236: 3280-3282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)1 is the key enzyme in the synthesis and hydrolysis of γ-glutamyl compounds such as glutathione in the γ-glutamyl cycle (4Tate S.S. Meister A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 39: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), little is known about the metabolism of β-aspartyl peptides.Glycosylasparaginase (GA; aspartylglucosaminidase;N 4-(β-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminyl)-l-asparaginase; EC 3.5.1.26) is a lysosomal amidase that hydrolyzes theN-glycosidic carbohydrate-to-protein linkage (N 4-(β-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminyl)-l-asparagine; β-aspartylglucosamine; GlcNAc-Asn) during degradation of glycoproteins. Genetic deficiency of glycosylasparaginase causes a lysosomal storage disease aspartylglycosaminuria (McKusick 208400) that is the most common disorder of glycoprotein degradation in humans and is clinically characterized by severe mental and motor retardation (5Thomas G.H.

Mononen T. Mononen I. Aronson N.N. Lysosomal Storage Disease: Aspartylglycosaminuria. R. G. Landes, 1997: 19-31Google Scholar). Glycosylasparaginase is a member of the recently described structural superfamily of enzymes termed as N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolases (7Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C.E. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of β-aspartylglycosylamines catalyzed by glycosylasparaginase is initiated by the binding of the β-aspartyl moiety into the active site of the enzyme through its free α-amino and α-carboxyl groups (8Makino M. Kojima T. Ohgushi T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1968; 63: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Kaartinen V. Mononen T. Laatikainen R. Mononen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6855-6858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme uses the γ-hydroxyl and α-amino group of its β-chain N-terminal threonine as an active site nucleophile and general base in the formation of β-aspartyl enzyme, which is subsequently deacylated by water tol-aspartic acid (10Kaartinen V.

Soc. 1997; 119: 1189-1196Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The GA-catalyzed hydrolysis ofl-asparagine occurs in a similar manner, resulting in the formation of β-aspartyl enzyme and ammonia (12Noronkoski T. Stoineva I.B. Petkov D.D. Mononen I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).The mechanism of action of glycosylasparaginase and the structural properties of its substrate-binding site (13Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) led us to consider that the enzyme might have a role in the metabolism of β-aspartyl peptides. In the present study, we demonstrate that synthesis and degradation of β-aspartyl peptides are new significant functions of glycosylasparaginase. This suggests that glycosylasparaginase could have an important role in the metabolism of β-aspartyl peptides present in body fluids and tissues.DISCUSSIONThe crystal structure of the glycosylasparaginase-aspartate complex revealed the binding mode of the zwitterionic aspartyl group but implied only that the hydrophobic residues Trp11 and Phe278 of the enzyme protein might be involved in the binding of the leaving (oligosaccharidyl) group (13Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This kind of hydrophobic and roomy oligosaccharidyl-binding site subsite could well accommodate the hydrophobic and bulky leaving group of β-aspartyl peptides. In fact, β-aspartame is hydrolyzed by glycosylasparaginase with kinetic parameters of the same order of magnitude as that of β-aspartylglycosylamine (Table I). Because the reaction components by themselves are virtually unreactive and no formation of β-aspartyl peptides was detected in the absence of glycosylasparaginase, the oligosaccharidyl-binding site in the enzyme must interact with the acceptor nucleophiles in the transamidase and transpeptidase reactions.Glycosylasparaginase has high activity in brain tissue (22Kaartinen V. Mononen I. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and it is tempting to speculate that GA-catalyzed β-aspartylation of amino acids within the tissue would lead to the presence of β-aspartyl peptides such as β-aspartylglycine and β-aspartyltaurine in mammalian brain (3Sandberg M. Li X. Folestad S. Weber S.G. Orwar O. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Whether their presence in the central nervous system reflects another system for the uptake of certain amino acids and/or a system for regulation of excitatory amino acid transmission remains to be investigated. β-Aspartyl peptides are also normal constituents of human urine (2Buchanan D.L. Haley E.E. Markiw R.T. Biochemistry. 1962; 1: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Tanaka et al. (23Tanaka T. Hirai M. Nakajima T. J. Biochem.

Based on their report and the data presented here, we suggest that the enzyme was glycosylasparaginase. The combined evidence indicates that glycosylasparaginase-catalyzed reactions provide a plausible enzymatic system, which is involved in the metabolism of β-aspartyl peptides present in body fluids and tissues. The demonstration that this enzyme can catalyze the synthesis and degradation of β-aspartyl peptides is important because it implicates that the metabolic defect in aspartylglycosaminuria is not restricted to disorders of glycoprotein degradation (24Aronson N.J. Mononen I. Aronson N.N. Lysosomal Storage Disease: Aspartylglycosaminuria. R. G. Landes, 1997: 55-75Google Scholar) but also affects the metabolism of β-aspartyl peptides. How this might relate to the development of the clinical symptoms in aspartylglycosaminuria remains to be investigated. The recently developed glycosylasparaginase-deficient mouse strain (25Kaartinen V. Mononen I. Voncken J.W. Noronkoski T. Gonzalez-Gomez I. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Nat.

We propose the name glycosylasparaginase/β-aspartyltransferase for the multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the enzymatic synthesis and degradation of β-aspartyl peptides, cleaves theN-glycosidic bond during degradation of glycoproteins (26Makino M. Kojima T. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 24: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and possesses l-asparaginase activity (12Noronkoski T. Stoineva I.B. Petkov D.D.

The unique structural features of Ntn hydrolases may account for their wide substrate specificity and the multifunctional properties found in this superfamily of enzymes. β-Aspartyl and γ-glutamyl peptides are normal constituents of mammalian urine (1Kakimoto Y.

Kojima T. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 24: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and possesses l-asparaginase activity (12Noronkoski T. Stoineva I.B. Petkov D.D. Mononen I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because GGT is also an Ntn hydrolase (7Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C.E. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and there are many biochemical similarities between GGT and GA, we predict that the binding mode of the nucleophile amino acids and peptides into the active site of GGT resembles the nucleophile binding to GA. The unique structural features of Ntn hydrolases may account for their wide substrate specificity and the multifunctional properties found in this superfamily of enzymes."
