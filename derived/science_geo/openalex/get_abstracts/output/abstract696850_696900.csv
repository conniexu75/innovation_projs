https://openalex.org/W4285494868,"Background The menstrual needs of girls and women are important to health, education, and well-being. Unmet need and harm from poor menstrual health in low-and- middle-income countries have been documented, but with little empirical research undertaken in high income countries. Continuing austerity in the UK suggests menstruators are likely more vulnerable to ‘period poverty’ than previously, with the COVID-19 pandemic assumed to exacerbate the situation. Aim To explore the menstrual experiences and perceptions of women in the UK who are living under circumstances of deprivation, alongside views of staff working in organisations supporting these women, to understand whether women’s menstrual needs are met. Methods A qualitative study was conducted in an inner-city in NW England. Three focus group discussions and 14 in-depth interviews were conducted across three study sites supporting impoverished women. Data was analysed thematically. Results Themes were: reflections on menstruation; affordability of products; access to public facilities; organisational support; potential solutions. Many women perceived menstruation as a burden in three aspects: physical discomfort and pain; psychological anxiety; and shame and stigma. Managing menstruation was difficult due to cost relative to low incomes, with food, heating and lighting prioritised, leaving women improvising with materials or wearing products for longer than desired. Most suggested that products should be free, often remarking if men required similar items this would happen. Most women were unaware supporting organisations provided free products. Staff felt the small range of products offered did not meet client needs and were ill-prepared to have conversations on products and clients’ menstrual needs. Conclusion Impoverished women lack the necessary resources to manage their menses well which negatively impacts their health and brings stress, embarrassment, and shame. Support, including access to free products, is needed at both local and national level to help impoverished women manage their menstrual hygiene."

The negative effects of the treatment regime have prompted the development of new antimicrobials against brucellosis. A new treatment modality for antibiotic-resistant microorganisms is the use of nanoparticles (NPs). In this study, we examined the antibacterial activities of silver and gold NPs (SNPs and GNPs, respectively), the resistance developed by Brucella melitensis (B. melitensis) and Brucella abortus (B. abortus) strains and the toxicity of both of these NPs in experimental rats. To test the bactericidal effects of the SNPs and GNPs, we used 22 multidrug-resistant Brucella isolates (10 B. melitensis and 12 B. abortus). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of both types of NPs were determined utilizing the microdilution technique. To test the stability of resistance, 7 B. melitensis and 6 B. abortus isolates were passaged ten times in culture with subinhibitory concentrations of NPs and another ten times without NPs. Histopathological analysis was completed after rats were given 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg NPs orally for 28 consecutive days. The MIC values (μg/ml) of the 10-nm SNPs and 20-nm GNPs against B. melitensis were 22.43 ± 2.32 and 13.56 ± 1.22, while these values were 18.77 ± 1.33 and 12.45 ± 1.59 for B. abortus, respectively. After extensive in vitro exposure, most strains showed no resistance to the 10-nm SNPs or 20-nm GNPs. The NPs and antibiotics did not cross-react in any of the evolved Brucella strains. SNPs and GNPs at doses below 2 mg/kg were not harmful to rat tissue according to organ histopathological examinations. However, a greater dose of NPs (2 mg/kg) harmed all of the tissues studied. The bactericidal properties of NPs are demonstrated in this work. Brucella strains develop similar resistance to SNPs and GNPs, and at low dosages, neither SNPs nor GNPs were hazardous to rats."

The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in healthy infant gut microbiome composition, metagenomic functional capacity, and associated metabolites over the course of the complementary feeding period. Fecal samples were obtained at three 'snapshot' timepoints from infants participating in the 'Nourish to Flourish' pilot study: before the introduction of solid foods at approximately 4 months of age, after introducing solid foods at 9 months of age, and after continued diet diversification at 12 months of age. KEGG and taxonomy assignments were correlated with LC-MS metabolomic profiles to identify patterns of co-abundance. The composition of the microbiome diversified during the first year of life, while the functional capacity present in the gut microbiome remained stable. The introduction of solid foods between 4 and 9 months of age corresponded to a larger magnitude of change in relative abundance of sequences assigned to KEGG pathways and taxonomic assignments, as well as to stronger correlations with metabolites, compared to the magnitude of changes and number of correlations seen during continued diet diversification between 9 and 12 months of age. Changes in aqueous fecal metabolites were more strongly correlated with KEGG pathway assignments, while changes in lipid metabolites associated with taxonomic assignments, particularly between 9 and 12 months of age. This study establishes trends in microbiome composition and functional capacity occurring during the complementary feeding period and identifies potential metabolite targets for future investigations."
https://openalex.org/W4285389453,"Kidney transplantation is the best therapeutical option for CKD patients. Graft loss risk factors are usually estimated with the cox method. Competing risk analysis could be useful to determine the impact of different events affecting graft survival, the occurrence of an outcome of interest can be precluded by another. We aimed to determine the risk factors for graft loss in the presence of mortality as a competing event.A retrospective cohort of 1454 kidney transplant recipients who were transplanted between July 1, 2008, to May 31, 2019, in Colombiana de Trasplantes, were analyzed to determine risk factors of graft loss and mortality at 5 years post-transplantation. Kidney and patient survival probabilities were estimated by the competing risk analysis. The Fine and Gray method was used to fit a multivariable model for each outcome. Three variable selection methods were compared, and the bootstrapping technique was used for internal validation as split method for resample. The performance of the final model was assessed calculating the prediction error, brier score, c-index and calibration plot.Graft loss occurred in 169 patients (11.6%) and death in 137 (9.4%). Cumulative incidence for graft loss and death was 15.8% and 13.8% respectively. In a multivariable analysis, we found that BKV nephropathy, serum creatinine and increased number of renal biopsies were significant risk factors for graft loss. On the other hand, recipient age, acute cellular rejection, CMV disease were risk factors for death, and recipients with living donor had better survival compared to deceased-donor transplant and coronary stent. The c-index were 0.6 and 0.72 for graft loss and death model respectively.We developed two prediction models for graft loss and death 5 years post-transplantation by a unique transplant program in Colombia. Using a competing risk multivariable analysis, we were able to identify 3 significant risk factors for graft loss and 5 significant risk factors for death. This contributes to have a better understanding of risk factors for graft loss in a Latin-American population. The predictive performance of the models was mild."

Hyperimmune globulin products such as VARIZIG and WinRho are FDA-approved to treat conditions during pregnancy such as Varicella Zoster virus infection and Rh-incompatibility. We administered ZIKV-specific human immune globulin as a treatment in pregnant rhesus macaques one day after subcutaneous ZIKV infection. All animals controlled ZIKV viremia following the treatment and generated robust levels of anti-Zika virus antibodies in their blood. No adverse fetal or infant outcomes were identified in the treated animals, yet the placebo control treated animals also did not have signs related to congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Human immune globulin may be a viable prophylaxis and treatment option for ZIKV infection during pregnancy, however, more studies are required to fully assess the impact of this treatment to prevent CZS."
https://openalex.org/W4285495131,"Importance Extracellular matrix proteins and enzymes involved in degradation have been found to be associated with tissue fibrosis and ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). In this study we developed a promising urinary biomarker model which can identify reduced renal function in UPJ obstruction patients. This can potentially serve as a non-invasive way to enhance surgical decision making for patients and urologists. Objective We sought to develop a predictive model to identify UPJO patients at risk for reduced renal function. Design Prospective cohort study Setting Pre-operative urine samples were collected in a prospectively enrolled UPJO biomarker registry at our institution. Urinary MMP-2, MMP-7, TIMP-2, and NGAL were measured as well as clinical characteristics including hydronephrosis grade, differential renal function, t 1/2 , and UPJO etiology. Participants Children who underwent pyeloplasty for UPJO Main outcome measurement Primary outcome was reduced renal function defined as MAG3 function &lt;40%. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify the independent predictive biomarkers in the original Training cohort. Model validation and generalizability were evaluated in a new UPJO Testing cohort. Results We included 71 patients with UPJO in the original training cohort and 39 in the validation cohort. Median age was 3.3 years (70% male). By univariate analysis, reduced renal function was associated with higher MMP-2 (p = 0.064), MMP-7 (p = 0.047), NGAL (p = 0.001), and lower TIMP-2 (p = 0.033). Combining MMP-7 with TIMP-2, the multivariable logistic regression model predicted reduced renal function with good performance (AUC = 0.830; 95% CI: 0.722–0.938). The independent testing dataset validated the results with good predictive performance (AUC = 0.738). Conclusions and relevance Combination of urinary MMP-7 and TIMP-2 can identify reduced renal function in UPJO patients. With the high sensitivity cutoffs, patients can be categorized into high risk (aggressive management) versus lower risk (observation)."
https://openalex.org/W4285386405,"This study's purpose is to characterize the performance of a prototype functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) headband meant to enable quick and easy measurements from the sensorimotor cortices. The fact that fNIRS is well-suited to ergonomic designs (i.e., their ability to be made wireless, their relative robustness to movement artifacts among other characteristics) has resulted in many recent examples of novel ergonomic fNIRS systems; however, the optical nature of fNIRS measurement presents an inherent challenge to measurement at areas of the brain underlying haired parts of the head. It is for this reason that the majority of ergonomic fNIRS systems that have been developed to date target the prefrontal cortex. In the present study we compared the performance of a novel, portable fNIRS headband compared with a stationary full headcap fNIRS system to measure sensorimotor activity during simple upper- and lower-extremity tasks, in healthy individuals >50 years of age. Both fNIRS systems demonstrated the expected pattern of hemodynamic activity in both upper- and lower-extremity tasks, and a comparison of the contrast-to-noise ratio between the two systems suggests the prototype fNIRS headband is non-inferior to a full head cap fNIRS system regarding the ability to detect a physiological response at the sensorimotor cortex during these tasks. These results suggest the use of a wireless and fibreless fNIRS design is feasible for measurement at the sensorimotor cortex."
https://openalex.org/W4285387151,"PFO closure is a percutaneous intervention, which aims to reduce risk of recurrent stroke by preventing paradoxical embolism. The objective of this study was to measure procedural safety and longer-term effectiveness of PFO closure in a UK setting.Prospective registry data from patients with cryptogenic stroke eligible for PFO closure were collected for up to 2 years and linked to routine data sources for additional follow-up. Outcomes of interest included procedural success rate, health related quality of life, and longer-term death and neurological event rates. A total of 973 PFO closure procedures in 971 patients were included in analysis. Successful device implantation was achieved in 99.4 [95% CI 98.6 to 99.8]% of procedures, with one in-hospital death. During median follow-up of 758 (Q1:Q3 527:968) days, 33 patients experienced a subsequent neurological event, 76% of which were ischaemic in origin. Neurological event rate was 2.7 [95%CI 1.6 to 3.9]% at 1-year (n = 751) and 4.1 [95% CI 2.6 to 5.5]% at 2-years (n = 463) using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Improvements in patient quality of life (utility and visual analogue scale) were observed at 6-weeks and 6-months follow-up.Our observational study demonstrates that PFO closure for prevention of recurrent stroke is a relatively safe procedure but in routine clinical practice is associated with a slightly higher risk of recurrent neurological events than in randomised trials. We hypothesize that our study enrolled unselected patients with higher baseline risk, who were excluded from randomised trials, but who may benefit from a similar relative reduction in risk from the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4285387218,"Background Alpha globin is expressed in the endothelial cells of human resistance arteries where it binds to endothelial nitric oxide synthase and limits release of the vasodilator nitric oxide. Genomic deletion of the alpha globin gene ( HBA ) is common among Black Americans and could lead to increased endothelial nitric oxide signaling and reduced risk of hypertension. Methods Community-dwelling US adults aged 45 years or older were enrolled and examined from 2003 to 2007, followed by telephone every 6 months, and reexamined from 2013 to 2016. At both visits, trained personnel performed standardized, in-home blood pressure measurements and pill bottle review. Prevalent hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90mmHg or anti-hypertensive medication use. Droplet digital PCR was used to determine HBA copy number. The associations of HBA copy number with prevalent hypertension, resistant hypertension, and incident hypertension were estimated using multivariable regression. Results Among 9,684 Black participants, 7,439 (77%) had hypertension at baseline and 1,044 of those had treatment-resistant hypertension. 1,000 participants were not hypertensive at baseline and participated in a follow up visit; 517 (52%) developed hypertension over median 9.2 years follow-up. Increased HBA copy number was not associated with prevalent hypertension (PR = 1.00; 95%CI 0.98,1.02), resistant hypertension (PR = 0.95; 95%CI 0.86,1.05), or incident hypertension (RR = 0.96; 95%CI 0.86,1.07). Conclusions There were no associations between increased HBA copy number and risk of hypertension. These findings suggest that variation in alpha globin gene copy number does not modify the risk of hypertension among Black American adults."
https://openalex.org/W4285387437,"Photosynthetic bacteria are beneficial to plants, but knowledge of photosynthetic bacterial community dynamics in field crops during different growth stages is scarce. The factors controlling the changes in the photosynthetic bacterial community during plant growth require further investigation. In this study, 35 microbial community samples were collected from the seedling, flowering, and mature stages of tomato, cucumber, and soybean plants. 35 microbial community samples were assessed using Illumina sequencing of the photosynthetic reaction center subunit M (pufM) gene. The results revealed significant alpha diversity and community structure differences among the three crops at the different growth stages. Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum, and Methylobacterium , Roseateles , and Thiorhodococcus were the dominant genera at all growth stages. PCoA revealed clear differences in the structure of the microbial populations isolated from leaf samples collected from different crops at different growth stages. In addition, a dissimilarity test revealed significant differences in the photosynthetic bacterial community among crops and growth stages (P&lt;0.05). The photosynthetic bacterial communities changed during crop growth. OTUs assigned to Methylobacterium were present in varying abundances among different sample types, which we speculated was related to the function of different Methylobacterium species in promoting plant growth development and enhancing plant photosynthetic efficiency. In conclusion, the dynamics observed in this study provide new research ideas for the detailed assessments of the relationship between photosynthetic bacteria and different growth stages of plants."
https://openalex.org/W4285388068,"The efficient calculation of the centrality or “hierarchy” of nodes in a network has gained great relevance in recent years due to the generation of large amounts of data. The eigenvector centrality (aka eigencentrality) is quickly becoming a good metric for centrality due to both its simplicity and fidelity. In this work we lay the foundations for solving the eigencentrality problem of ranking the importance of the nodes of a network with scores from the eigenvector of the network, using quantum computational paradigms such as quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing. The problem is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) that can be solved on both quantum architectures. The results focus on correctly identifying a given number of the most important nodes in numerous networks given by the sparse vector solution of our QUBO formulation of the problem of identifying the top- τ highest eigencentrality nodes in a network on both the D-Wave and IBM quantum computers."
https://openalex.org/W4285388268,"Economists well understand that the work of Friedrich Hayek contains important theoretical insights. It is less often acknowledged that his work contains testable predictions about the nature of market processes. Vernon Smith termed the most important one the 'Hayek hypothesis': that gains from trade can be realized in the presence of diffuse, decentralized information, and in the absence of price-taking behavior and centralized market direction. Vernon Smith tested this prediction by surveying data on laboratory experimental markets and found strong support. We extend Smith's work first by showing how subsequent theoretical advances provide a theoretical foundation for the Hayek Hypothesis. We then test the hypothesis using recent field experimental market data. Using field experiments allows us to test several other predictions from Hayek, such as that market experience increases the realized gains from trade. Generally speaking, we find support for Hayek's theories."
https://openalex.org/W4285388519,"In recent years, researchers and policymakers have emphasised the importance of understanding the complex relationships between Water, Energy, Food and Ecosystems (WEFE). The primary reason for capturing these complexities is to understand how decisions made in the water, food and energy sectors can affect one another. Crucially, biodiversity and ecosystem services (E) play a mediating role in these relationships by making material and non-material contributions to all other sectors (W, E, F). The Nexus approach has been widely used for capturing these interdependencies and identifying opportunities for increasing efficiency, reducing trade-offs and building synergies for sustainable resource use across the WEFE nodes. One challenge in using this framework is the need to harmonise the technical and managerial dimensions of the WEFE interlinkages with the perceptions and priorities of local populations directly involved in the use and management of resources. This paper presents a methodological framework that seeks to integrate the perspectives of experts, practitioners and local stakeholders on the WEFE Nexus through the combined application of the Delphi and Focus Group methods. In this paper, the municipality of Apokoronas in Crete, Greece has served as the case in point. The combined framework allowed us to explore the Nexus understanding at the local level and was instrumental in the identification of initiatives for more integrated resource management. The triangulation of results captured the differences in priorities between practitioners and the local community at large, but also, more specifically, it pointed to discrepancies within groups and across WEFE sectors. The outcomes of this paper demonstrate that awareness and learning play a central role in Nexus actions to overcome conflicts and perceived inequalities, and to internalise solutions. The inclusion of the ecosystems node in the traditional WEF Nexus encouraged participants to contemplate the pivotal role of ecosystems in supporting the rest of the WEF sectors."
https://openalex.org/W4285389668,"Vacuoles in plants and fungi play critical roles in cell metabolism and osmoregulation. To support these functions, vacuoles change their morphology, e.g. they fragment when these organisms are challenged with draught, high salinity or metabolic stress (e.g. acetate accumulation). In turn, morphology reflects an equilibrium between membrane fusion and fission that determines size, shape and copy number. By studying Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its vacuole as models, conserved molecular mechanisms responsible for fusion have been revealed. However, a detailed understanding of vacuole fission and how these opposing processes respond to metabolism or osmoregulation remain elusive. Herein we describe a new fluorometric assay to measure yeast vacuole fission in vitro. For proof–of–concept, we use this assay to confirm that acetate, a metabolic stressor, triggers vacuole fission and show it blocks homotypic vacuole fusion in vitro. Similarly, hypertonic stress induced by sorbitol or glucose caused robust vacuole fission in vitro whilst inhibiting fusion. Using wortmannin to inhibit phosphatidylinositol (PI) -kinases or rGyp1-46 to inactivate Rab–GTPases, we show that acetate stress likely targets PI signaling, whereas osmotic stress affects Rab signaling on vacuole membranes to stimulate fission. This study sets the stage for further investigation into the mechanisms that change vacuole morphology to support cell metabolism and osmoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W4285389924,"Cochlear implants (CIs) provide an opportunity for the hearing impaired to perceive sound through electrical stimulation of the hearing (cochlear) nerve. However, there is a high risk of losing a patient's natural hearing during CI surgery, which has been shown to reduce speech perception in noisy environments as well as music appreciation. This is a major barrier to the adoption of CIs by the hearing impaired. Electrocochleography (ECochG) has been used to detect intra-operative trauma that may lead to loss of natural hearing. There is early evidence that ECochG can enable early intervention to save natural hearing of the patient. However, detection of trauma by observing changes in the ECochG response is typically carried out by a human expert. Here, we discuss a method of automating the analysis of cochlear responses during CI surgery. We establish, using historical patient data, that the proposed method is highly accurate (∼94% and ∼95% for sensitivity and specificity respectively) when compared to a human expert. The automation of real-time cochlear response analysis is expected to improve the scalability of ECochG and improve patient safety."
https://openalex.org/W4285390467,"This paper introduces a series of high resolution (100-meter) population grids for eight different sociodemographic variables across the state of California using data from the 2020 census. These layers constitute the 'CA-POP' dataset, and were produced using dasymetric mapping methods to downscale census block populations using fine-scale residential tax parcel boundaries and Microsoft's remotely-sensed building footprint layer as ancillary datasets. In comparison to a number of existing gridded population products, CA-POP shows good concordance and offers a number of benefits, including more recent data vintage, higher resolution, more accurate building footprint data, and in some cases more sophisticated but parsimonious and transparent dasymetric mapping methodologies. A general accuracy assessment of the CA-POP dasymetric mapping methodology was conducted by producing a population grid that was constrained by population observations within block groups instead of blocks, enabling a comparison of this grid's population apportionment to block-level census values, yielding a median absolute relative error of approximately 30% for block group-to-block apportionment. However, the final CA-POP grids are constrained by higher-resolution census block-level observations, likely making them even more accurate than these block group-constrained grids over a given region, but for which error assessments of population disaggregation is not possible due to the absence of observational data at the sub-block scale. The CA-POP grids are freely available as GeoTIFF rasters online at github.com/njdepsky/CA-POP, for total population, Hispanic/Latinx population of any race, and non-Hispanic populations for the following groups: American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Black/African-American, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, White, other race or multiracial (two or more races) and residents under 18 years old (i.e. minors)."
https://openalex.org/W4285390845,"Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations that play important roles in both endocytosis and membrane tension buffering. Typical caveolae have invaginated structures with a high-density caveolin assembly. Membrane sculpting proteins, including PACSIN2 and EHD2, are involved in caveolar biogenesis. PACSIN2 is an F-BAR domain-containing protein with a membrane sculpting ability that is essential for caveolar shaping. EHD2 is also localized at caveolae and involved in their stability. However, the spatial relationship between PACSIN2, EHD2, and caveolin has not yet been investigated. We observed the single-molecule localizations of PACSIN2 and EHD2 relative to caveolin-1 in three-dimensional space. The single-molecule localizations were grouped by their proximity localizations into the geometric structures of blobs. In caveolin-1 blobs, PACSIN2, EHD2, and caveolin-1 had overlapped spatial localizations. Interestingly, the mean centroid of the PACSIN2 F-BAR domain at the caveolin-1 blobs was closer to the plasma membrane than those of EHD2 and caveolin-1, suggesting that PACSIN2 is involved in connecting caveolae to the plasma membrane. Most of the blobs with volumes typical of caveolae had PACSIN2 and EHD2, in contrast to those with smaller volumes. Therefore, PACSIN2 and EHD2 are apparently localized at typically sized caveolae."

Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a thromboembolic event (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, Cases n = 20). Controls (n = 20): Age, sex-matched without thromboembolic events. Patients with autoimmune disorders, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, thrombophilia, anticoagulation therapy, prior thromboembolism, chronic kidney disease 3b, 4, end-stage renal disease, and malignancy were excluded. Given the limited current literature on the role of concomitant antiphospholipid antibodies and vitamin D deficiency in causing venous and/or arterial thrombosis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we enrolled 20 patients in each arm. Anti-cardiolipin IgG/IgM, beta-2 glycoprotein-1 IgG/IgM, lupus anticoagulant and vitamin D levels were measured in both groups.Cases were 5.7 times more likely to be vitamin D deficient (OR:5.7, 95% CI:1.3-25.6) and 7.4 times more likely to have any one APLa (OR:7.4, 95% CI: 1.6-49.5) while accounting for the effects of sex. Patients with both APLa and vitamin D deficiency had significantly more thrombosis compared to patients who were antibody positive without vitamin D deficiency (100% vs 47.4%; p = 0.01).Thrombosis in COVID-19 was associated with concomitant APLa and vitamin D deficiency. Future studies in COVID-19 should assess the role of vitamin D in reducing thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W4285494445,"Finding ways to improve police legitimacy and police-community relations has for long been an important social issue in the United States. It becomes particularly urgent following the murder of George Floyd on May 25th, 2020. An emerging area that holds potential in remediating police-community relations pertains to the use of social media by police. Yet, this body of research stays highly exploratory (e.g., case studies based on a small sample of agencies) and different viewpoints exist regarding the objectives of police social media usage. The current study identified 115 large police departments in the U.S. and collected their tweets over a 4-month period between 4/1/2020 and 7/31/2020. We investigated how police agencies (both individually and as an aggregate) leveraged social media to respond to the nationwide protests directed at the police and community reactions to such responses. We found that police agencies tweeted more frequently in the immediate aftermath of the murder and posted an increased number of civil-unrest related tweets. The public showed a greater interest in engaging with law enforcement agencies (i.e., average favorite and retweet counts) following the murder. A great variability emerged across agencies in their responses on social media, suggesting that examining only a handful of agencies or a particular dimension of social media usage would limit our understanding of police behaviors and citizen interactions on social media. In conclusion, we suggested a few avenues for future research (and practices) on responsible and effective use of social media by police, while pointing out the challenges associated with such inquiries."
https://openalex.org/W4285494588,"The use of two or more microorganisms in a microbial consortium has been increasingly applied in the biological control of diseases and pests. Beauveria bassiana is one of the most widely studied fungal species in biological control, yet little is known about its role in fungal consortiums. In a previous study, our group found that a consortium formed by two strains of B. bassiana had significantly greater biocontrol potential against the polyphagous caterpillars Duponchelia fovealis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) than either strain on its own. In this study, we use GC-MS and LC-MS/MS to evaluate and discuss the metabolomics of the consortium. A total of 21 consortium biomarkers were identified, corresponding to 14 detected by LC-MS/MS and seven by GC-MS. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms are the main properties of the metabolites produced by the consortium. These metabolites can depress the insect's immune system, increasing its vulnerability and, hence, the fungal virulence of the consortium. In light of these results, we propose an action model of insect mortality due to the metabolites secreted by the consortium. The model includes the inhibition of defense mechanisms such as pro-inflammatory interleukin secretion, cell migration, cell aggregation, Dif, Dorsal and Relish gene transcription, and JAK/STAT and JNK signaling pathways. It also promotes the cleaning of oxidative molecules, like ROS, NOS, and H2O2, and the induction of virulence factors."
https://openalex.org/W4285494959,"Physical activity (PA) has been identified as an essential tool for the prevention and management of multi-morbidity in patients. Coordination of patients’ care through interventions like physical activity referral schemes (PARS) could foster the utilization of PA. This study explored the views of General Practitioners (GPs) and Exercise Physiologists (EPs) as key stakeholders, for optimizing patient care and efficiency of PARS. Sequential explanatory mixed methods design was used to explore the perceptions of these health professionals on PA and coordination strategies for PARS patient care. Data analyses included descriptive and inferential statistics for questionnaires and theoretical framework analysis for the semi-structured interviews. Participants demonstrated a good knowledge of PA and valued PARS. However, the findings unravelled external factors, inter-organisational mechanisms, and relational coordination obstacles that hinder efficient coordination of PARS patient care and delay/limit beneficial health outcomes for patients. Incentivising the PARS initiative and empowering patients to seek referral into the programme, are strategies that could boost PARS efficiency. Improving inter-professional relationships between GPs and EPs could lead to enhanced PARS functionality and efficient coordination of care for patients with chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4285495573,"The genus Stenella is comprised of five species occurring in all oceans. Despite its wide distribution, genetic diversity information on these species is still scarce especially in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Some features of this genus can enhance opportunities for potential introgressive hybridization, e.g. sympatric distibution along the Brazilian coast, mixed known associations among species, karyotype uniformity and genome permeability. In this study we analyzed three genes of the mitochondrial genome to investigate the genetic diversity and occurrence of genetic mixture among eighty specimens of Stenella . All species exhibited moderate to high levels of genetic diversity (h = 0.833 to h = 1.000 and π = 0.006 to π = 0.015). Specimens of S. longirostris , S . attenuata and S . frontalis were clustered into differentiated haplogroups, in contrast, haplotypes of S . coeruleoalba and S . clymene were clustered together. We detected phylogenetic structure of mixed clades for S . clymene and S . coeruleoalba specimens, in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean, and also between S . frontalis and S . attenuata in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, and between S . frontalis and S . longirostris in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. These specimes were morphologically identified as one species but exhibited the maternal lineage of another species, by mitochondrial DNA. Our results demonstrate that ongoing gene flow is occurring among species of the genus Stenella reinforcing that this process could be one of the reasons for the confusing taxonomy and difficulties in elucidating phylogenetic relationships within this group."
https://openalex.org/W4226246602,"Efficient realization of quantum algorithms is among main challenges on the way towards practical quantum computing. Various libraries and frameworks for quantum software engineering have been developed. Here we present a software package containing implementations of various quantum gates and well-known quantum algorithms using PennyLane library. Additoinally, we used a simplified technique for decomposition of algorithms into a set of gates which are native for trapped-ion quantum processor and realized this technique using PennyLane library. The decomposition is used to analyze resources required for an execution of Shor's algorithm on the level of native operations of trapped-ion quantum computer. Our original contribution is the derivation of coefficients needed for implementation of the decomposition. Templates within the package include all required elements from the quantum part of Shor's algorithm, specifically, efficient modular exponentiation and quantum Fourier transform that can be realized for an arbitrary number of qubits specified by a user. All the qubit operations are decomposed into elementary gates realized in PennyLane library. Templates from the developed package can be used as qubit-operations when defining a QNode."
https://openalex.org/W4285386450,"The formation and development of religious diversity is a manifestation of the free expression of human thought, belief, and practice, as well as a historical premise and ideological condition for the gradual recognition and integration of modern religions into modern political values. This study examines the spatial characteristics of the development of the global religious diversity index (RDI) and the evolution trend through a geographical perspective by the LISA space-time transition and convergence test. The results show that: (1) At the temporal level, RDI showed a fast and then slow increase after WWII, with an increase of 61.11%. (2) At the spatial level, Latin America has seen the most significant increase in RDI, followed by Europe, North America and the Caribbean, while Asia has a slight decrease. (3) At the country level, most countries with the highest levels of RDI are located in North America and the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, and most of these countries have a history of being colonized. RDI was mainly influenced by factors such as the missionary effect in the colonial period, precipitation, GDP per capita, and genetic diversity. (4) The evolution of the spatial structure of global RDI has a certain path-dependent, but this trend is gradually weakening. In addition to countries' own development, RDI is also influenced by spillover effects from the neighboring countries. (5) There is a significant σ convergence and absolute β convergence in the global RDI, and most of the continental units have club convergence, i.e., the internal differences in RDI levels at the global and regional levels are gradually narrowing, and there is a spillover effect of higher RDI levels to the surrounding lower regions, and this diffusion or influence allows the lower regions to catch up in the gap of RDI."
https://openalex.org/W4285386534,"Emicizumab mimics the hemostatic activity of activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) within the tenase complex. Despite functional similarities between FVIIIa and emicizumab, conventional laboratory methods designed for monitoring of FVIII activity are inappropriate for the measurement of emicizumab. At present, a modified one stage (FVIII) assay (mOSA) is mainly used for emicizumab monitoring. Two-stage chromogenic FVIII assays based on human factors can be used, although limited performance due to lack of corresponding optimization might be observed. Furthermore, the presence of FVIII or anticoagulants in the patient sample may falsify assay results. To address these issues, we optimized and evaluated a two-stage chromogenic assay (emi-tenase) for measurement of emicizumab in plasma samples. Heat inactivation of samples was established to abolish the influence of endogenous or substituted FVIII. The lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) was found to be 2 μg/ml in a manual assay format and 9.5 μg/ml on an automated coagulation analyzer. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) did not exceed 20%. Analysis of 17 patient plasma samples with severe haemophilia A under emicizumab treatment showed good correlation of results between the emi-tenase assay and the mOSA (Cohens Kappa coefficient = 0.9). Taken together, the emi-tenase assay allows specific measurement of emicizumab plasma levels over a broad concentration range (10 μg/ml to 100 μg/ml). The assay can be applied on an automated coagulation analyzer, demonstrating its applicability within a routine laboratory setting."
https://openalex.org/W4285386603,"In an empirical analysis of transposable element (TE) abundance within natural populations of Mimulus guttatus and Drosophila melanogaster, we found a surprisingly high variance of TE count (e.g., variance-to-mean ratio on the order of 10 to 300). To obtain insight regarding the evolutionary genetic mechanisms that underlie the overdispersed population distributions of TE abundance, we developed a mathematical model of TE population genetics that includes the dynamics of element proliferation and purifying selection on TE load. The modeling approach begins with a master equation for a birth-death process and extends the predictions of the classical theory of TE dynamics in several ways. In particular, moment-based analyses of population distributions of TE load reveal that overdispersion is likely to arise via copy-and-paste proliferation dynamics, especially when the elementary processes of proliferation and excision are approximately balanced. Parameter studies and analytic work confirm this result and further suggest that overdispersed population distributions of TE abundance are probably not a consequence of purifying selection on total element load."
https://openalex.org/W4285387124,"Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has overwhelmed hospital services due to the rapid transmission of the virus and its severity in a high percentage of cases. Having tools to predict which patients can be safely early discharged would help to improve this situation. Methods Patients confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection from four Spanish hospitals. Clinical, demographic, laboratory data and plasma samples were collected at admission. The patients were classified into mild and severe/critical groups according to 4-point ordinal categories based on oxygen therapy requirements. Logistic regression models were performed in mild patients with only clinical and routine laboratory parameters and adding plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels to predict both early discharge and worsening. Results 333 patients were included. At admission, 307 patients were classified as mild patients. Age, oxygen saturation, Lactate Dehydrogenase, D-dimers, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and oral corticosteroids treatment were predictors of early discharge (area under curve (AUC), 0.786; sensitivity (SE) 68.5%; specificity (S), 74.5%; positive predictive value (PPV), 74.4%; and negative predictive value (NPV), 68.9%). When cytokines were included, lower interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 and higher Interleukin 1 beta levels were associated with early discharge (AUC, 0.819; SE, 91.7%; S, 56.6%; PPV, 69.3%; and NPV, 86.5%). The model to predict worsening included male sex, oxygen saturation, no corticosteroids treatment, C-reactive protein and Nod-like receptor as independent factors (AUC, 0.903; SE, 97.1%; S, 68.8%; PPV, 30.4%; and NPV, 99.4%). The model was slightly improved by including the determinations of interleukine-8, Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta and soluble IL-2Rα (CD25) (AUC, 0.952; SE, 97.1%; S, 98.1%; PPV, 82.7%; and NPV, 99.6%). Conclusions Clinical and routine laboratory data at admission strongly predict non-worsening during the first two weeks; therefore, these variables could help identify those patients who do not need a long hospitalization and improve hospital overcrowding. Determination of pro-inflammatory cytokines moderately improves these predictive capacities."
https://openalex.org/W4285389652,"Time use studies quantify what people do, over particular time intervals. The results of these studies have illuminated diverse and important aspects of societies and economies, from populations around the world. Yet, these efforts have advanced in a fragmented manner, using non-standardized descriptions (lexicons) of time use that often require researchers to make arbitrary designations among non-exclusive categories, and are not easily translated between disciplines. Here we propose a new approach, assembling multiple dimensions of time use to construct what we call the human chronome, as a means to provide novel interdisciplinary perspectives on fundamental aspects of human behaviour and experience. The approach is enabled by parallel lexicons, each of which aims for low ambiguity by focusing on a single coherent categorical dimension, and which can then be combined to provide a multi-dimensional characterization. Each lexicon should follow a single, consistent theoretical orientation, ensure exhaustiveness and exclusivity, and minimize ambiguity arising from temporal and social aggregation. As a pragmatic first step towards this goal, we describe the development of the Motivating- Outcome- Oriented General Activity Lexicon (MOOGAL). The MOOGAL is theoretically oriented towards the outcomes of activities, is applicable to any human from hunter-gatherers to modern urbanites, and deliberately focuses on the physical outcomes which motivate the undertaking of activities to reduce ambiguity from social aggregation. We illustrate the utility of the MOOGAL by comparing it with existing economic, sociological and anthropological lexicons, showing that it exhaustively covers the previously-defined activities with low ambiguity, and apply it to time use and economic data from two countries. Our results support the feasibility of using generalized lexicons to incorporate diverse observational constraints on time use, thereby providing a rich interdisciplinary perspective on the human system that is particularly relevant to the current period of rapid social, technological and environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W4285389689,"Loess has the characteristics of large porosity, loose structure, uniform composition and strong collapsibility. When encountering heavy rainfall and irrigation prone to saturation, resulting in loess landslides, roadbed subsidence and dam instability. In order to study the effect of dry density and shear rate on the shear strength of saturated remolded loess, the consolidated undrained (CU) test was carried out in Yan’an City by using SLB-6A stress-strain controlled triaxial shear permeability test instrument. The shear rate, confining pressure and dry density were controlled during the test. The dry densities of the samples were 1.5 g / cm3, 1.6 g / cm3 and 1.7 g / cm3, respectively. CU tests of saturated remolded loess were carried out at different shear rates under the confining pressures of 100 kPa, 150 kPa and 200 kPa, respectively. It is found that the stress-strain curve of saturated remolded loess gradually moves upward with the increase of dry density. With the increase of dry density, the cohesion and internal friction angle of remolded saturated loess samples increase. At the same shear rate, with the increase of dry density, the deviatoric stress of the specimen increases significantly."
https://openalex.org/W4285389936,"Mosquitoes are found in tropical and subtropical areas and are the carriers of a variety of diseases that are harmful to people’s health. e . g ., malaria, filariasis, chikungunya, dengue fever, etc. Although several insecticides are available, however, due to insect resistance and environmental hazards, more eco-friendly chemicals are needed for insect control. So, the current research was planned to explore the prospective of Mentha piperita to be used for the formulation of larvicides against mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus . The ethanolic and water extracts of M . piperita leaves were prepared using the soxhlet apparatus. The extracts were dried and subjected to prepare five concentrations multiple of 80 ppm. Each concentration was applied for its larvicidal efficacy setting an experiment (in triplicate) in plastic containers of 1000 ml with extracts, 30 larvae of all four instars separately, and fed with dog biscuits along with controls. Observations were taken after each 12 hrs. till 72 hrs. The antioxidant perspective of M . piperita was determined by DPPH radical scavenging, total antioxidant capacity, and ferric reducing power assays. Using brine shrimp lethality bioactivity, the cytotoxic study was perceived. Standard techniques were used to classify the M . piperita extract using preliminary qualitative and quantitative phytochemicals, UV-Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, and GC-MS analysis. M . piperita ethanolic leaves extract after 24 hrs. of exposure in 400 ppm showed 93% (LC 50 = 208.976 ppm) mortality in ethanolic extract and 80% (LC 90 = 246.900 ppm) in the water extract. In treated larvae, biochemical examination revealed a substantial (P&lt;0.05) decrease in proteins, carbohydrates, and fat contents. The ethanol extract of M . piperita was the most efficient, killing brine shrimp nauplii in 50% to 90% of cases. TAC (125.4 3.5gAAE/mg DW) and FRP (378.1 1.0gAAE/mg DW) were highest in the ethanolic extract of M . piperita . The presence of medicinally active components such as alkaloids, carbohydrates, flavonoids, and others in M . piperita leaves extract in ethanol was discovered. The UV-Vis spectrum showed two peaks at 209.509 and 282.814 nm with the absorption of 2.338 and 0.796 respectively. The FT-IR consequences exhibited the occurrence of alcohols, alkanes, aldehyde, aromatic rings, ether linkage, ester, and halo- compounds. The GC-MS analysis according to peak (%) area and retention time showed ten phytochemicals consisting of six major and four minor compounds. Among all the compounds, 1, 2-benzene dicarboxylic acid, and 3-ethyl-5, 5-dimethyl -6-phenyl bound well to the NS3 protease domain with PDB ID: 2FOM. Hence, for the prevention of health hazards and mosquito control, M . Piperita is a potential source of chemicals for insecticide formulation."
https://openalex.org/W4285390249,"Objective Colorectal cancer (CRC) is common in older adults, with more than 70% of diagnoses in people aged ≥65 years. Despite this, there is a knowledge gap regarding longer-term outcomes in this population. Here, we identify those older people most at risk of poor quality of life (QoL) and health status in the five years following CRC treatment. Materials and methods CREW is a UK longitudinal cohort study investigating factors associated with health and wellbeing recovery following curative-intent CRC surgery. Participants completed self-report questionnaires pre-surgery, then at least annually up to five years. Longitudinal analyses explored the prevalence and pre-surgery risk factors of poor QoL (QLACS-GSS) and health status (EQ-5D: presence/absence of problems in five domains) in older (≥65 years) participants over five years. Results 501 participants aged ≥65years completed questionnaires pre-surgery; 45% completed questionnaires five years later. Oldest-old participants (≥80 years) reported poorer QoL (18% higher QLACS-GSS) and 2–4 times higher odds of having problems with mobility or usual activities, compared with the youngest-old (65–69 years) over follow-up. Baseline higher self-efficacy was significantly associated with better QoL (10–30% lower QLACS-GSS scores compared to those with low self-efficacy) and lower odds of problems in all EQ-5D domains. Adequate social support was significantly associated with better QoL (8% lower QLACS-GSS) and lower odds of problems with usual activities (OR = 0.62) and anxiety/depression (OR = 0.56). Conclusion There are important differences in QoL and health status outcomes for the oldest-old during CRC recovery. CREW reveals pre-surgery risk factors that are amenable to intervention including self-efficacy and social support."
https://openalex.org/W4285494399,"Drug-resistant (DR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M . tb ) are increasingly recognised as a threat to global tuberculosis (TB) control efforts. Identifying people with DR-TB exposure/ infection and providing TB preventive therapy (TPT) is a public health priority. TB guidelines advise the evaluation of household contacts of newly diagnosed TB cases, with the provision of TPT to vulnerable populations, including young children (&lt;5 years). Many children become infected with TB through exposure in their household. Levofloxacin is under evaluation as TPT in children exposed to M . tb strains with resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid (multidrug-resistant TB; MDR-TB). Prior to opening a phase 3 prevention trial in children &lt;5 years exposed to MDR-TB, the pharmacokinetics and safety of a novel formulation of levofloxacin given daily was evaluated as part of a lead-in study. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study of 10 caregivers’ experiences of administering this formulation. We explored how the acceptability of levofloxacin as TPT is shaped by the broader impacts of MDR-TB on the overall psychological, social, and financial wellbeing of caregivers, many of whom also had experienced MDR-TB. Caregivers reported that the novel levofloxacin formulation was acceptable. However, caregivers described significant psychosocial challenges in the process of incorporating TPT administration to their children into their daily lives, including financial instability, withdrawal of social support and stigma. When caregivers themselves were sick, these challenges became even more acute. Although new child-friendly formulations can ameliorate some of the pragmatic challenges related to TPT preparation and administration, the overall psychosocial burden on caregivers responsible for administering TPT remains a major determinant of effective MDR-TB prevention in children."

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the second cause of nosocomial infection in Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU). As far as we know, there are no studies comparing both types of pneumonia in children, thus it remains unclear if there are differences between them in terms of severity and outcomes.The aim was to compare clinical and microbiological characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe CAP and VAP.A retrospective descriptive study, including patients diagnosed of VAP and CAP, with a positive respiratory culture and under mechanical ventilation, admitted to the PICU from 2015 to 2019.238 patients were included; 163 (68.4%) with CAP, and 75 (31.5%) with VAP. Patients with VAP needed longer mechanical ventilation (14 vs. 7 days, p<0.001) and more inotropic support (49.3 vs. 30.7%, p = 0.006). Patients with VAP had higher mortality (12 vs. 2.5%, p = 0.005). Enterobacterales were more involved with VAP than with CAP (48 vs. 9%, p<0.001). Taking into account only the non-drug sensitive microorganisms, patients with VAP tended to have more multidrug-resistant bacteria (30 vs. 10.8%, p = 0.141) than patients with CAP.Patients with VAP had worse prognosis than patients with CAP, needing longer mechanical ventilation, more inotropic support and had higher mortality. Patients with VAP were mainly infected by Enterobacterales and had more multidrug resistant microorganisms than patients with CAP."
https://openalex.org/W4285495626,"Background Mastectomy currently constitutes a necessary surgical procedure in the oncologic setting and in the context of high risk. Prepectoral breast reconstruction (PBR) has been proposed as a surgical alternative to retropectoral techniques by providing less postoperative morbidity and a better cosmetic result. However, there is a lack of prospective studies that have evaluated its safety and patient-reported satisfaction. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess the safety, quality of life and cosmetic sequelae of PBR in women with breast cancer and high risk. The study’s main objective is to assess the safety of PBR in terms of postsurgical complications and the feasibility of reconstruction (loss of implants). The secondary objectives are to evaluate oncologic safety (local relapses, residual glandular tissue) and to identify factors related to quality of life and cosmetic sequelae. The evaluation of residual tissue will be conducted by MRI 12 to 18 months after the surgery, and the quality-of-life assessment will be performed using the Breast-Q questionnaire. An initial patient evaluation will be conducted 12–18 months after the surgery, and a second evaluation will be performed at 5 years. The estimated sample size is 81 patients. Discussion The PreQ-20 study will analyze the impact of PBR on 3 separate measures: safety, quality of life and cosmetic sequelae. Unlike other studies that analyzed these three measures jointly for women with breast cancer and high risk, this study will individualize the results for these 2 patient groups. This differentiation is necessary from the methodological point of view, given that the 2 patient groups have separate clinical and emotional implications. The assessment of these groups will focus on the following aspects: postoperative complications, local relapses, evaluation of residual glandular tissue and incidence rate of primary tumors in the same, the cosmetic sequelae and the satisfaction and the quality-of-life assessment by the patients.

https://openalex.org/W4285386166,"eHealth systems allow efficient daily smartphone-based collection of self-reported data on mood, wellbeing, routines, and motivation; however, missing data is frequent. Within addictive disorders, missing data may reflect lack of motivation to stay sober. We hypothesize that qualitative questionnaire data contains valuable information, which after proper handling of missing data becomes more useful for practitioners.Anonymized data from daily questionnaires containing 11 questions was collected with an eHealth system for 751 patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Two digital continuous biomarkers were composed from 9 wellbeing questions (WeBe-i) and from two questions representing motivation/self-confidence to remain sober (MotSC-i). To investigate possible loss of information in the process of composing the digital biomarkers, performance of neural networks to predict exacerbation events (relapse) in alcohol use disorder was compared.Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks predicted a coming exacerbation event 1-3 days (AUC 0.68-0.70) and 5-7 days (AUC 0.65-0.68) in advance on unseen patients. The predictive capability of digital biomarkers and raw questionnaire data was equal, indicating no loss of information. The transformation into digital biomarkers enable a continuous graphical display of each patient's clinical course and a combined interpretation of qualitative and quantitative aspects of recovery on a time scale.By transforming questionnaire data with large proportion of missing data into continuous digital biomarkers, the information captured by questionnaires can be more easily used in clinical practice. Information, assessed by the capability to predict exacerbation events of AUD, is preserved when processing raw questionnaire data into digital biomarkers."

Methodology A cross-sectional survey among a purposive sample of 82 CTSs providing DOT and administering injections to MDR-TB patients was conducted in May 2017. Observations in the patients’ homes were undertaken to verify CTSs’ self-reported community-based MDR-TB management practices. Results Out of 82 respondents, 78 (95.1%) were female and half (n = 41; 50.0%) had primary education or lower. Over one-tenth (n = 12; 14.6%) had not attended a MDR-TB training workshop, but were administering injections. The overall KAP scores were satisfactory. Good self-reported community-based MDR-TB practices were largely verified through observation. However, substantial proportions of respondents incorrectly defined MDR-TB, were unaware of the treatment regimen, stigmatised patients, and underreported needlestick injuries. There was no statistically significant association between duration administering intramuscular injections, MDR-TB training, knowledge and attitudes, and good community-based MDR-TB management practices. Conclusions The gaps in the current KAP of CTSs in this setting raise questions about the timing, adequacy, design and content of community-based MDR-TB management training. Nonetheless, with appropriate training, lay CTSs in this region can be an option to complement an overstretched professional health workforce in providing DOT and MDR-TB injections at community level."

In this series, 57 individuals were molecularly confirmed for 7 GSD subtypes and their demographic data, clinical profiles and genotype-phenotype co-relations are studied. Genomic DNA from venous blood samples was isolated from clinically affected individuals. Targeted gene panel sequencing covering 23 genes and Sanger sequencing were employed. Various bioinformatic tools were used to predict pathogenicity for new variations. Close parental consanguinity was seen in 76%. Forty-nine pathogenic variations were detected of which 27 were novel. Variations were spread across GSDIa, Ib, III, VI, IXa, b and c. The largest subgroup was GSDIII in 28 individuals with 24 variations (12 novel) in AGL. The 1620+1G>C intronic variation was observed in 5 with GSDVI (PYGL). A total of eleven GSDIX are described with the first Indian report of type IXb. This is the largest study of GSDs from India.

https://openalex.org/W4285387843,"Although micronutrient and antioxidant supplementation are widely used by persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a therapeutic role beyond recommended daily allowances (RDA) remains unproven. An oral high-dose micronutrient and antioxidant supplement (Treatment) was compared to an RDA supplement (Control) for time to progressive immunodeficiency or initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people living with HIV (PLWH).This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial. PLWH were recruited from Canadian HIV Trials Network sites, and followed quarterly for two years. Eligible participants were asymptomatic, antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naïve, HIV-seropositive adults with a CD4 T lymphocyte count (CD4 count) between 375-750 cells/μL. Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive Treatment or Control supplements. The primary outcome was a composite of time-to-first of confirmed CD4 count below 350 cells/μL, initiation of ART, AIDS-defining illness or death. Primary analysis was by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes included CD4 count trajectory from baseline to ART initiation or two years. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board reviewed the study for safety, recruitment and protocol adherence every six months.Of 171 enrolled participants: 66 (38.6%) experienced a primary outcome: 27 reached a CD4 count below 350 cells/μL, and 57 started ART. There was no significant difference in time-to-first outcome between groups (Hazard Ratio = 1.05; 95%CI: 0.65, 1.70), or in time to any component outcome. Using intent-to-treat censoring, mean annualized rates of CD4 count decline were -42.703 cells/μL and -79.763 cells/μL for Treatment and Control groups, with no statistical difference in the mean change between groups (-37.06 cells/μL/52 weeks, 95%CI: (-93.59, 19.47); p = 0.1993). Accrual was stopped at 171 of the 212 intended participants after an interim analysis for futility, although participant follow-up was completed.In ART-naïve PLWH, high-dose antioxidant, micronutrient supplementation compared to RDA supplementation had no significant effect on disease progression or ART initiation.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00798772."
https://openalex.org/W4285388055,"Ancient undeciphered scripts present problems of different nature, not just tied to linguistic identification. The undeciphered Cypro-Minoan script from second millennium BCE Cyprus, for instance, currently does not have a standardized, definitive inventory of signs, and, in addition, stands divided into three separate subgroups (CM1, CM2, CM3), which have also been alleged to record different languages. However, this state of the art is not consensually accepted by the experts. In this article, we aim to apply a method that can aid to shed light on the tripartite division, to assess if it holds up against a multi-pronged, multi-disciplinary approach. This involves considerations linked to paleography (shapes of individual signs) and epigraphy (writing style tied to the support used), and crucially, deep learning-based strategies. These automatic methods, which are widely adopted in many fields such as computer vision and computational linguistics, allow us to look from an innovative perspective at the specific issues presented by ancient, poorly understood scripts in general, and Cypro-Minoan in particular. The usage of a state-of-the-art convolutional neural model that is unsupervised, and therefore does not use any prior knowledge of the script, is still underrepresented in the study of undeciphered writing systems, and helps to investigate the tripartite division from a fresh standpoint. The conclusions we reached show that: 1. the use of different media skews to a large extent the uniformity of the sign shapes; 2. the application of several neural techniques confirm this, since they highlight graphic proximity among signs inscribed on similar supports; 3. multi-stranded approaches prove to be a successful tool to investigate ancient scripts whose language is still unidentified. More crucially, these aspects, together, point in the same direction, namely the validation of a unitary, single Cypro-Minoan script, rather than the current division into three subgroups."

In three experiments, we found that most participants did not manage to extract NADs. These results suggest that the ability to learn NADs in noise is the exception rather than the rule.

https://openalex.org/W4285389639,"We explored whether increased C-nociceptor excitability predicts analgesic effects of topical lidocaine in 33 patients with mono- (n = 15) or poly-neuropathy (n = 18). Excitability of C-nociceptors was tested by transcutaneous electrical sinusoidal (4 Hz) and half sine wave (single 500 ms pulse) stimulation delivered to affected and non-affected sites. Analgesic effects of 24 hrs topical lidocaine were recorded. About 50% of patients reported increased pain from symptomatic skin upon continuous 4 Hz sinusoidal and about 25% upon 500 ms half sine wave stimulation. Electrically-evoked half sine wave pain correlated to their clinical pain level (r = 0.37, p &lt; 0.05). Lidocaine-patches reduced spontaneous pain by &gt;1-point NRS in 8 of 28 patients (p &lt; 0.0001, ANOVA). Patients with increased pain to 2.5 sec sinusoidal stimulation at 0.2 and 0.4 mA intensity had significantly stronger analgesic effects of lidocaine and in reverse, patients with a pain reduction of &gt;1 NRS had significantly higher pain ratings to continuous 1 min supra-threshold sinusoidal stimulation. In the assessed control skin areas of the patients, enhanced pain upon 1 min 4 Hz stimulation correlated to increased depression scores (HADS). Electrically assessed C-nociceptor excitability identified by slowly depolarizing electrical stimuli might reflect the source of neuropathic pain in some patients and can be useful for patient stratification to predict potential success of topical analgesics. Central neuronal circuitry assessment reflected by increased pain in control skin associated with higher HADS scores suggest central sensitization phenomena in a sub-population of neuropathic pain patients."

There was also a significant effect (p = 0.028) of the year of study and type of residence of the students on the high level of DP and RPA. Daily sleep hours of students had Daily sleep hours of the veterinary students were also indicated as a significant associated risk factor of burnout among veterinary students in this study as more less sleep hours (<6hours), causes high levels of DP and RPA. Age, gender and marital status, working status, exercise hours and weekly study hours of students did not count as significant predictive factors (p>0.05) of burnout."
https://openalex.org/W4285389954,"Drought and nutrient pollution can affect the dynamics of stream ecosystems in diverse ways. While the individual effects of both stressors are broadly examined in the literature, we still know relatively little about if and how these stressors interact. Here, we performed a mesocosm experiment that explores the compounded effects of seasonal drought via water withdrawals and nutrient pollution (1.0 mg/L of N and 0.1 mg/L of P) on a subset of Ozark stream community fauna and ecosystem processes. We observed biological responses to individual stressors as well as both synergistic and antagonistic stressor interactions. We found that drying negatively affected periphyton assemblages, macroinvertebrate colonization, and leaf litter decomposition in shallow habitats. However, in deep habitats, drought-based increases in fish density caused trophic cascades that released algal communities from grazing pressures; while nutrient enrichment caused bottom-up cascades that influenced periphyton variables and crayfish growth rates. Finally, the combined effects of drought and nutrient enrichment interacted antagonistically to increase survival in longear sunfish; and stressors acted synergistically on grazers causing a trophic cascade that increased periphyton variables. Because stressors can directly and indirectly impact biota-and that the same stressor pairing can act differentially on various portions of the community simultaneously-our broad understanding of individual stressors might not adequately inform our knowledge of multi-stressor systems."
https://openalex.org/W4285493910,"The two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch L. (Acari: Tetranychidae), is a plant pest that can lead to severe economic losses in open field cucumber cultivation. Between 2017 and 2019 we studied the abundance of spider mites in the soil to estimate the potential infestation pressure of soil colonizing spider mites. The spider mites were heterogeneously distributed in small concentrations in the soil. Soil colonizing spider mites did not affect spider mite abundance on plants and reversed. We observed that spider mite migration occurred primarily from the edge of the field adjacent to the weed strip. In 2020 and 2021, we investigated the efficacy of the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) for suppressing spider mite hotspots in the cropland. We compared untreated spider mite hotspots with N. californicus treated hotspots and showed that a single release of predatory mites could result in a high level of control when spider mite infestation density was initially high. With this study, soil can be ruled out as a habitat for spider mites, and attention to spider mite pest control can be directed to plant infestations. The highly sensitive HRM real-time PCR assay was used for the quantification of the spider mites."
https://openalex.org/W4285494487,"Improvement in practitioners' consultation skills (CSs) can be driven by patient feedback, however, to date, no study has been conducted with reference to pharmacy consultations. The Interpersonal Skills Questionnaire (ISQ) is potentially appropriate for collecting patient feedback on pharmacists' CSs. This study aims to explore the feasibility of collecting patient feedback on hospital pharmacists' CSs using the ISQ, to identify the acceptability of the feedback process, and to identify methods to enhance the process in the future.The study was conducted in a teaching hospital, United Kingdom, between 2018 and 2019. A diverse sample of pharmacists with patient-facing roles was purposively selected. The study comprised three phases. Pharmacists collected feedback from patients following their consultation using the ISQ utilising a third person whenever possible (phase-1). Data analysis and individual report writing was conducted by a private company. Interviewing a sample of patient participants by telephone (phase-2), and interviewing pharmacists face-to-face after receiving feedback reports (phase-3). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. The study received approval by the NHS Health Research Authority.Six pharmacists were included. Of the 119 distributed ISQs, 111 were returned (response rate 93%). Patients were mostly recruited by their consulting pharmacists (72%, n = 80). All pharmacists and 14 patients were interviewed. Participants were positive about patient feedback and its role in enhancing CSs. Most did not encounter any problem with the process, however, some pharmacists struggled to find a third person. The ISQ was mostly viewed suitable to assessing pharmacy consultations. Some reports highlighted areas to improve (e.g. protecting patient's privacy).Collecting feedback is feasible, acceptable and may enhance CSs, however, the process was associated with challenges such as finding a third person. Several measures should be considered to make the process more feasible within the hospital pharmacy setting."
https://openalex.org/W4285494553,"The relationship between bothersome symptoms and gastric pressure or CO2 injection volumes in drug-resistant functional dyspepsia (FD) patients remains unknown; therefore, this relationship was examined in drug-resistant FD and non-FD patients.Thirty drug-resistant FD patients and 30 non-FD patients were recruited. Gastric pressure was assessed using an external pressure transducer, and the CO2 injection volume was measured using an endoscopic CO2-supplied device and flow meter. The following variables were examined: gastric pressure at baseline and gastric pressure and the CO2 injection volume when patients initially felt abdominal tension and bothersome symptoms following the CO2 injection. The relationship between belching and bothersome symptoms was also investigated.No significant differences were observed in basal gastric pressure between the groups. Initial and bothersome symptoms in the upper abdomen in drug-resistant FD patients developed at a significantly lower gastric pressure and significantly smaller CO2 injection volume than in non-FD patients. The frequency of belching was significantly lower in the drug-resistant FD group than in the non-FD group.Bothersome symptoms in drug-resistant FD patients develop at a lower gastric pressure and smaller CO2 injection volume than in non-FD patients. These patients also had difficulties with belching."
https://openalex.org/W4285494608,"Varieties of raisins are diverse, and different varieties have different nutritional properties and commercial value. In this paper, we propose a method to identify different varieties of raisins by combining near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and machine learning algorithms. The direct averaging of the spectra taken for each sample may reduce the experimental data and affect the extraction of spectral features, thus limiting the classification results, due to the different substances of grape skins and flesh. Therefore, this experiment proposes a method to fuse the spectral features of pulp and peel. In this experiment, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract baseline corrected features, and linear models of k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and nonlinear models of back propagation (BP), support vector machine with genetic algorithm (GA-SVM), grid search-support vector machine (GS-SVM) and particle swarm optimization with support vector machine (PSO- SVM) coupling were used to classify. This paper compared the results of four experiments using only skin spectrum, only flesh spectrum, average spectrum of skin and flesh, and their spectral feature fusion. The experimental results showed that the accuracy and Macro-F1 score after spectral feature fusion were higher than the other three experiments, and GS-SVM had the highest accuracy and Macro-F1 score of 94.44%. The results showed that feature fusion can improve the performance of both linear and nonlinear models. This may provide a new strategy for acquiring spectral data and improving model performance in the future. The code is available at https://github.com/L-ain/Source ."
https://openalex.org/W4285495006,"Research on the transfer of antibiotic resistance plasmids has been mainly focused on the large multi-drug resistance conjugative plasmids, while the transmission of small mobilizable plasmids remains under-investigated. A series of diverse ColE-like kanamycin resistance plasmids (“KanR plasmids”) from Salmonella enterica were characterized previously. In this study, the 6.6-kb pSNC3-Kan from a Salmonella enterica serotype Newport isolate was investigated. It possessed highly conserved RNA I/II and Tn 602 (IS 903 - aph -IS 903 ) regions to two other KanR plasmids pSe-Kan and pSBardo-Kan, but carried a mobC-mobA/BD operon. The mobilization proteins encoded by the mob operon of pSNC3-Kan showed high sequence identity (~95%) to those of an E . coli plasmid pEC34B, except that MobE was not present; and were much less conserved to those of another KanR plasmid pSN11/00Kan (43% - 86% identity). Four structurally different KanR plasmids were investigated for their ability to be mobilized by the conjugal transfer ( tra ) genes from F and IncP plasmids. Transfer genes derived from IncP plasmids can efficiently mobilize KanR plasmids possessing the mob operons ( mobC-mobA/BD ), such as pSNC3-Kan and pSN11/00Kan, in bi-parental mating experiments. On the other hand, F tra genes were able to mobilize pU302S, pSNC3-Kan and pSe-Kan, but not pSN11/00Kan. A plasmid-borne mob operon was not required for mobilization of the oriT(F) -bearing pSe-Kan by the F tra genes. This study underscores the complexity of plasmid interaction and the importance of how small mobilizable plasmids may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes."
https://openalex.org/W4285495182,"This research was designed to explore the variation characteristics of soil C:N:P stoichiometry and enzyme activity in the Qilian Mountains different grassland types. Thus, 7 grassland types (Upland meadow: UM, Alpine meadow: AM, Temperate steppe: ST, Alpine steppe: AS, Temperate Desert Steppe: TDS, Temperate Desert: TD, Alpine desert: AD) of Qilian Natural Reserve were selected to analyze the variation characteristics of soil enzyme activities and stoichiometry of different grassland types and its relationship with environmental factors. The study indicated that the C/N, C/P, and N/P of different grasslands ranged from 5.08 to 17.35, 2.50 to 72.29, and 0.53 to 4.02.The ranking of different types grassland for the C/N was TS ≥ AM ≥ UM ≥ AS ≥ TDS > AD > TD, and the changing pattern of C/P and N/P is similar to that of C/N. The ranking of different types grassland for the urease enzyme activity was UM ≈AS > AD ≈TDS ≈TS ≈AM > TD, and TS ≈AM ≈UM ≈AS ≈AD > TDS > TD for alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity, and AS ≈AM ≈TS ≈TDS≥UM ≥TD ≈AD for catalase enzyme activity. Based on N/P ratio and RDA analysis, nitrogen was the main factor limiting the grassland productivity, and pH, TN, SOC, Richness index and Simpson diversity index were the main environmental factors affecting the soil C:N:P stoichiometry and enzyme activities. Cluster analysis showed that 7 grassland types were clustered into three categories. In conclusion, the stoichiometric characteristics and soil enzyme activities of different grasslands vary with grassland types. Nitrogen was the main factor limiting the grasslands productivity, and pH, TN, SOC, Richness index and Simpson diversity index were the main environmental factors affecting the soil C:N:P stoichiometry and enzyme activities, and the grassland Qilian Mountain can be managed in the ecological district according to the clustering results. The results of this study can provide data support and theoretical guidance for the scientific management and ecological protection of grassland in Qilian Mountains Reserve."
