https://openalex.org/W2119228812,"India has been underrepresented in genome-wide surveys of human variation. We analyse 25 diverse groups in India to provide strong evidence for two ancient populations, genetically divergent, that are ancestral to most Indians today. One, the ‘Ancestral North Indians’ (ANI), is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans, whereas the other, the ‘Ancestral South Indians’ (ASI), is as distinct from ANI and East Asians as they are from each other. By introducing methods that can estimate ancestry without accurate ancestral populations, we show that ANI ancestry ranges from 39–71% in most Indian groups, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers. Groups with only ASI ancestry may no longer exist in mainland India. However, the indigenous Andaman Islanders are unique in being ASI-related groups without ANI ancestry. Allele frequency differences between groups in India are larger than in Europe, reflecting strong founder effects whose signatures have been maintained for thousands of years owing to endogamy. We therefore predict that there will be an excess of recessive diseases in India, which should be possible to screen and map genetically. Analysis of genetic variation in 132 individuals from 25 diverse groups in India reveals that two ancient, genetically divergent populations are ancestral to most Indians today. One lineage, termed Ancestral North Indian, is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians and Europeans. The other, Ancestral South Indian, is not close to any group outside the subcontinent. The answers to several long-standing questions emerge from this work. It seems that 'caste' has been a powerful force shaping marriage in India for thousands of years — some anthropologists argued that its current strength was a product of British colonialism. And the enigmatic 'Negritos' of the Andaman Islands are identified as an ancient isolate from the Ancestral South Indian population. Allele frequency differences between population groups are high, in part due to the custom of within-group marriages, so it is likely that there is an excess of recessive diseases in India that can be screened for and mapped genetically. Genome-wide analysis of human variation in 25 diverse groups from India reveals two ancient populations, genetically divergent, that are ancestral to most Indians today. Traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers tend to be descended from a group that is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians and Europeans. The other group, the 'Ancestral South Indians', does not appear to be close to any group outside the subcontinent."

https://openalex.org/W2085289028,"To explore the mechanisms and evolution of cell-cycle control, we analyzed the position and conservation of large numbers of phosphorylation sites for the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We combined specific chemical inhibition of Cdk1 with quantitative mass spectrometry to identify the positions of 547 phosphorylation sites on 308 Cdk1 substrates in vivo. Comparisons of these substrates with orthologs throughout the ascomycete lineage revealed that the position of most phosphorylation sites is not conserved in evolution; instead, clusters of sites shift position in rapidly evolving disordered regions. We propose that the regulation of protein function by phosphorylation often depends on simple nonspecific mechanisms that disrupt or enhance protein-protein interactions. The gain or loss of phosphorylation sites in rapidly evolving regions could facilitate the evolution of kinase-signaling circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2155762441,"The extent to which evolution is reversible has long fascinated biologists. Most previous work on the reversibility of morphological and life-history evolution has been indecisive, because of uncertainty and bias in the methods used to infer ancestral states for such characters. Further, despite theoretical work on the factors that could contribute to irreversibility, there is little empirical evidence on its causes, because sufficient understanding of the mechanistic basis for the evolution of new or ancestral phenotypes is seldom available. By studying the reversibility of evolutionary changes in protein structure and function, these limitations can be overcome. Here we show, using the evolution of hormone specificity in the vertebrate glucocorticoid receptor as a case-study, that the evolutionary path by which this protein acquired its new function soon became inaccessible to reverse exploration. Using ancestral gene reconstruction, protein engineering and X-ray crystallography, we demonstrate that five subsequent 'restrictive' mutations, which optimized the new specificity of the glucocorticoid receptor, also destabilized elements of the protein structure that were required to support the ancestral conformation. Unless these ratchet-like epistatic substitutions are restored to their ancestral states, reversing the key function-switching mutations yields a non-functional protein. Reversing the restrictive substitutions first, however, does nothing to enhance the ancestral function. Our findings indicate that even if selection for the ancestral function were imposed, direct reversal would be extremely unlikely, suggesting an important role for historical contingency in protein evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2074450319,"The emergence and spread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites has been a disaster for world health. Resistance is conferred by mutations in the Chloroquine Resistance Transporter (PfCRT), an integral membrane protein localized to the parasite's internal digestive vacuole. These mutations result in a marked reduction in the accumulation of chloroquine (CQ) by the parasite. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. We expressed both wild-type and resistant forms of PfCRT at the surface of Xenopus laevis oocytes. The resistant form of PfCRT transported CQ, whereas the wild-type protein did not. CQ transport via the mutant PfCRT was inhibited by CQ analogs and by the resistance-reverser verapamil. Thus, CQ resistance is due to direct transport of the drug via mutant PfCRT."
https://openalex.org/W2088565743,"At least four laboratories have shown that endogenous cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) can be grown directly from adult heart tissue in primary culture, as cardiospheres or their progeny (cardiosphere-derived cells, CDCs). Indeed, CDCs are already being tested in a clinical trial for cardiac regeneration. Nevertheless, the validity of the cardiosphere strategy to generate CPCs has been called into question by reports based on variant methods. In those reports, cardiospheres are argued to be cardiomyogenic only because of retained cardiomyocytes, and stem cell activity has been proposed to reflect hematological contamination. We use a variety of approaches (including genetic lineage tracing) to show that neither artifact is applicable to cardiospheres and CDCs grown using established methods, and we further document the stem cell characteristics (namely, clonogenicity and multilineage potential) of CDCs.CPCs were expanded from human endomyocardial biopsies (n = 160), adult bi-transgenic MerCreMer-Z/EG mice (n = 6), adult C57BL/6 mice (n = 18), adult GFP(+) C57BL/6 transgenic mice (n = 3), Yucatan mini pigs (n = 67), adult SCID beige mice (n = 8), and adult Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 80). Cellular yield was enhanced by collagenase digestion and process standardization; yield was reduced in altered media and in specific animal strains. Heparinization/retrograde organ perfusion did not alter the ability to generate outgrowth from myocardial sample. The initial outgrowth from myocardial samples was enriched for sub-populations of CPCs (c-Kit(+)), endothelial cells (CD31(+), CD34(+)), and mesenchymal cells (CD90(+)). Lineage tracing using MerCreMer-Z/EG transgenic mice revealed that the presence of cardiomyocytes in the cellular outgrowth is not required for the generation of CPCs. Rat CDCs are shown to be clonogenic, and cloned CDCs exhibit spontaneous multineage potential.This study demonstrates that direct culture and expansion of CPCs from myocardial tissue is simple, straightforward, and reproducible when appropriate techniques are used."
https://openalex.org/W2033102824,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a cell membrane protein that exports excess cholesterol from cells to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, the major protein in high density lipoproteins. Genetic studies have shown that ABCA1 protects against cardiovascular disease. The interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 promotes cholesterol removal and activates signaling molecules, such as Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), that optimize the lipid export activity of ABCA1. Here we show that the ABCA1-mediated activation of JAK2 also activates STAT3, which is independent of the lipid transport function of ABCA1. ABCA1 contains two candidate STAT3 docking sites that are required for the apoA-I/ABCA1/JAK2 activation of STAT3. The interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1-expressing macrophages suppressed the ability of lysopolysaccaride to induce the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, which was reversed by silencing STAT3 or ABCA1. Thus, the apoA-I/ABCA1 pathway in macrophages functions as an anti-inflammatory receptor through activation of JAK2/STAT3. These findings implicate ABCA1 as a direct molecular link between the cardioprotective effects of cholesterol export from arterial macrophages and suppressed inflammation.

Thus, the apoA-I/ABCA1 pathway in macrophages functions as an anti-inflammatory receptor through activation of JAK2/STAT3. These findings implicate ABCA1 as a direct molecular link between the cardioprotective effects of cholesterol export from arterial macrophages and suppressed inflammation. Two major processes that initiate the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in the artery wall are inflammation and the deposition of excess cholesterol in macrophages. It is believed that both of these events are in response to trapping of sterol-rich lipoproteins in the artery, where they undergo oxidation and other modifications to become inflammatory stimuli that recruit and activate macrophages (1.Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells ingest and degrade the modified lipoproteins, leading to intracellular accumulation of cholesterol ester lipid droplets. Population studies have shown an inverse relationship between circulating levels of HDLs and risk for cardiovascular disease, implying that factors associated with HDL metabolism are cardioprotective. One of these factors is ABCA1, which exports cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to lipid-poor apoA-I to generate precursors for HDL particles (2.Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1343-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Because it is highly induced by sterols through nuclear receptors, ABCA1 is expressed in cholesterol-loaded cells, such as macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions (3.Passarelli M. Tang C. McDonald T.O. O'Brien K.D. Gerrity R.G. Heinecke J.W. Oram J.F. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2198-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in ABCA1 accelerate atherosclerosis (4.Singaraja R.R. Brunham L.R. Visscher H. Kastelein J.J. Hayden M.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1322-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which is likely to be the result of enhanced accumulation of cholesterol-rich macrophages in arteries and the hyper-inflammatory responses of these cells. The cholesterol export function of ABCA1 occurs by a cascade of events involving direct binding of apoA-I to ABCA1, activation of signaling pathways, and solubilization of cholesterol and phospholipid domains formed by ABCA1 on the cell surface (5.Vaughan A.M. Tang C. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 285-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).

Activation of JAK2 enhanced the apoA-I binding activity of ABCA1 responsible for lipid removal (6.Tang C. Vaughan A.M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Oram J.F. J.

Receptor-mediated activation of JAK2 usually stimulates signaling pathways that activate transcription factors called STATs (8.Aaronson D.S. Horvath C.M. Science. 2002; 296: 1653-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility that the interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 also activates one or more STATs. We found that exposing ABCA1 expressing cells to apoA-I increased phosphorylation of STAT3 without affecting STAT1 or STAT5, and this was independent of the lipid export activity of ABCA1. Because STAT3 plays a major role in suppressing inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages (9.Williams L.M. Sarma U. Willets K. Smallie T. Brennan F. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6965-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a cell-type that expresses high levels of ABCA1 when sterol loaded, we also examined the possibility that the interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 could suppress macrophage inflammatory cytokine production through STAT3. Results show that incubating apoA-I with activated ABCA1-expressing macrophages suppresses production of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α by a STAT3-dependent process, raising the possibility that the ABCA1 has a direct anti-inflammatory function in addition to its lipid export activity. STAT3, phospho-STAT3, and phosopho-JAK2 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling; and STAT1, phopsho-STAT1, anti-STAT5, phospho-STAT5, and JAK2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. ABCA1 antibody was purchased from Novus. The JAK2 specific inhibitor AG490 was purchased from Sigma, and cell-permeable STAT3 inhibitor was purchased from Calbiochem. ApoA-I was purified from HDL as described previously (10.Mendez A.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 and DBA mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. ABCA1−/−/DBA mice were a gift from Robert Aiello, Pfizer-Wyeth; STAT3flox/flox/C57BL/6 mice were a gift from Shizuo Akiro, Osaka University; and Lys-M-Cre/C57BL/6 mice were a gift from Karin Bornfeldt, University of Washington. To generate mice lacking STAT3 in macrophages and neutrophils, STAT3flox/flox were crossed with Lys-M-Cre mice to generate mice that carried the homozygous STAT3flox/flox/Lys-M-Cre mice. Control wild-type mice were generated by interbreeding STAT3wt/wt with Lys-M-Cre mice. Wild-type and mutant BHK cells expressing mifepristone-inducible human ABCA1 were generated as described previously (11.Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Control (mock) BHK cells were derived from the same clonal line transfected with plasmids lacking the ABCA1 cDNA insert. Site-directed mutagenesis of ABCA1 was carried out using the QuikChange XL Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA) (5.Vaughan A.M. Tang C. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 285-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells were selected against Neozi, and clonal lines expressing similar amounts of wild-type (WT) ABCA1, mutants Y924F, Y1990F, or Y924/1990F were used for the experiments. BHK cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum until experiments. J774 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. To induce ABCA1 expression, J774 cells were loaded overnight with 50 μg/ml acetylated LDL in the presence of 5 μm TO901317 (an LXR agonist that induces ABCA1) in DMEM containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine albumin (12.Wang Y. Kurdi-Haidar B. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 972-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained as previously described (13.Renard C.B. Kramer F. Johansson F. Lamharzi N. Tannock L.R. von Herrath M.G. Chait A. Bornfeldt K.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 h, unseeded cells were washed away, and the medium was changed to DMEM, 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine albumin. To induce ABCA1 expression, cells were loaded with 50 μg/ml acetylated LDL overnight. Because non-induced macrophages or BHK cells express very low or no detectable endogenous ABCA1, cells treated with inducers are defined as “cells expressing ABCA1.” For cytokine expression experiments, cells were pre-treated with or without 10 μg/ml of apoA-I in DMEM, 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine albumin for 3 h, washed twice, treated with or without 10 ng/ml LPS for 3 h, and then processed for RNA extractions. Bone marrow macrophages for immunoblots were derived by flushing out mouse femurs and tibias with RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum and culturing cells for 1 week. Cellular cholesterol was labeled with 1 μCi/ml of [3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) added to the growth medium 24 h prior to mifepristone incubations. Washed cells were then incubated with DMEM/BSA minus or plus 10 μg/ml apoA-I, and medium and cells were assayed for free [3H]cholesterol (14.Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). ApoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux was calculated as the percent total [3H]cholesterol released into medium after subtraction of values obtained in the absence of apoA-I and was normalized to values for cells expressing wild-type ABCA1. Cells without induced ABCA1 had cholesterol efflux values insignificantly above induced cells incubated in the absence of apoA-I. Cells were lysed in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete mini; Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (phosphatase inhibitor mixture II; Calbiochem) and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent as instructed. Equal amounts of protein were added per gel lane, resolved by SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, 1000–2000 μg of protein of 1 ml of lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies (2–4 μg) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation for 1 h with Protein A-magnetic beads. Immunocomplexes were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Band intensity was quantified from the autoradiograph scans using OptiQuant computer software (Packard Instruments). Thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages or J774 cells were plated in 24-well plates and maintained in DMEM with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Silencer negative control siRNA and silencer validated STAT3 siRNAs (mSTAT3 siRNA: sense, 5′-AAGGCCGTGGTGCGTGAGAAA-3′) were purchased from Ambion. Transfection with siRNA diluted in Opti-MEM I at a concentration of 100 nmol was performed using Hiperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to their instruction. One day after transfection, medium was changed, and cells were loaded overnight with 50 μg/ml of acetylated LDL in DMEM without (peritoneal macrophages) or with 5 μm TO901317 (J774 macrophages). Cells were treated with or without 10 μg/ml of apoA-I for 3 h, washed twice, and then treated with/without 10 ng/ml of LPS for 3 h. Cells were collected for RT-PCR analyses. The one-step real-time RT-PCR was performed to quantify cytokines mRNA expression using the Mx4000 Muliplex Quantitative PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the TaqMan one-step RT-PCR master reagent kit (ABI), according to the instructions. The amplifications of cytokines and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA were run using 100 ng of total RNA retrieved from samples using the Agilent total RNA isolation kit (Agilent Technology). Reactions were prepared in a 96-well optical grade PCR plate in a total of 50 μl containing the following components: 100 ng of total RNA, 25 μl of 2× master mix, 2 units of the reverse transcriptase SuperScript II, and 25 μl of TaqMan Gene Expression assay mixture (including primers and probe, from ABI). Thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial reverse transcription step at 45 °C for 30 min, followed by 10 min at 95 °C, and then followed by 40 cycles of amplification. Each cycle of amplification consisted of a denaturizing step at 95 °C for 30 s and an annealing/extension step at 60 °C for 1 min. The IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 18S primers and probes used for the RT-PCR were purchased from Applied Biosystems and used TaqMan Gene Expression Assays. Results were calculated as mean ± S.D. of 3–6 values, and statistical differences were calculated by Student's t test. Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of JAK2 (P-JAK2), we found that incubating ABCA1-transfected BHK cells with apoA-I for only minutes dramatically increased phosphorylation and thus activation of JAK2, which was not observed in cells lacking ABCA1 (Fig. 1A). The total cell content of JAK2 was unaffected by either ABCA1 expression or exposure to apoA-I (Fig. 1B). We carried out co-immunoprecipitation studies to determine whether JAK2 and ABCA1 form a molecular complex. When ABCA1 was induced in transfected BHK cells, JAK2 co-immunoprecipitated with ABCA1 whether or not cells were treated with apoA-I (Fig. 1C). This JAK2 was phosphorylated only when the ABCA1-expressing cells were treated with apoA-I (Fig. 1D). We also found that treating lysates of ABCA1-expressing BHK cells with a P-JAK2 antibody co-precipitated ABCA1 (not shown). Thus, JAK2 constitutively binds to ABCA1, where it is activated by apoA-I. Because JAK2 is a tyrosine kinase, we examined ABCA1 immunoprecipitated from transfected BHK cells for changes in its phosphotyrosine content using an antibody specific for this modified amino acid. Phosphorylated tyrosines were detected in ABCA1 in the basal state, but this increased over 2-fold when cells were incubated with apoA-I (Fig. 1E). Reversal of this increase by AG490 (a JAK2-specific inhibitor) implied that JAK2 was responsible for this effect. These results are consistent with the idea that the interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1-expressing cells rapidly activates JAK2, which in turn phosphorylates ABCA1 tyrosines. Activation of JAK2 through binding of ligands to a wide variety of plasma membrane receptors also activates one or more of a family of transcription factors called STATs (8.Aaronson D.S. Horvath C.M. Science. 2002; 296: 1653-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the possibility that the interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 activates a STAT using antibodies specific for different P-STATs. Incubating BHK cells lacking ABCA1 with apoA-I had no effect on phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT1 (Fig. 2A), or STAT5 (not shown). When ABCA1 was induced, however, apoA-I stimulated STAT3 but not STAT1 (Fig. 2A) or STAT5 phosphorylation. This effect was inhibited by AG490 (not shown), implying that it was mediated by JAK2. When lysates of transfected BHK cells were treated with an antibody specific for P-STAT3, ABCA1 was co-immunoprecipitated with P-STAT3 only from cells expressing ABCA1 and incubated with apoA-I (Fig. 2B). We also examined the possibility that apoA-I-mediated activation of STAT3 occurs in cholesterol-loaded macrophages, the cell-type most relevant to ABCA1 cell biology in vivo (3.Passarelli M. Tang C. McDonald T.O. O'Brien K.D. Gerrity R.G. Heinecke J.W. Oram J.F. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2198-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). P-STAT3 levels were markedly increased in J774 macrophages when they were incubated with the LXR agonist TO901317 to induce ABCA1 and then treated with apoA-I (Fig. 2C). Total STAT3 and P-STAT3 were co-immunoprecipitated with ABCA1 only from macrophages that were induced to express ABCA1 and exposed to apoA-I (Fig. 2D). Thus, incubating ABCA1-expressing macrophages with apoA-I recruits STAT3 to ABCA1 where it becomes phosphorylated. Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1-expressing cells rapidly activates JAK2, which creates phosphorylated docking sites on ABCA1 that bind and activate STAT3. The STAT3 docking sites in cytosolic domains of plasma membrane receptors have a highly conserved YXXQ sequence (15.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). We searched ABCA1 for these motifs and found one in each of the large cytosolic loops that contain the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs): at amino acids 924–927 (YEGQ) in NBD1 and residues 1990–1994 (YCPQ) in NBD2. These motifs are highly conserved between ABCA1s of different species (chimpanzee, horse, dog, cow, mouse, rat, chicken, zebrafish, zebra finch, platypus, and tree shrew), and the Tyr-1990 motif is conserved between all ABCAs. We generated cells expressing ABCA1 with phenylalanines substituted for tyrosines in each or both of these YXXQ motifs and selected clonal cell lines that had similar ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux activities and ABCA1 protein levels (based on immunoblots) as cells expressing wild-type ABCA1 (Fig. 3A). We compared the ability of apoA-I to stimulate phosphorylation of STAT3 in these different cell lines by scanning autoradiograms of blots probed with P-STAT3 antibody and reprobed with total STAT3 antibody and by calculating the ratios. Exposing apoA-I to BHK cells transfected with wild-type ABCA1 tripled the fraction of STAT3 that was phosphorylated (Fig. 3B). Mutating Tyr-924 slightly decreased this fraction, but mutating Tyr-1990 markedly decreased apoA-I-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT3. Mutating both Tyr-924 and Tyr-1990 completely abolished apoA-I-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation, suggesting some cooperativity between these two sites. Probing immunoprecipitates of STAT3 with an ABCA1 antibody revealed that the apoA-I-stimulated interaction of ABCA1 with STAT3 was completely abolished by the Y924F/Y1990F mutations (Fig. 3C). These findings implicate these motifs, especially Tyr-1990, as the docking sites on ABCA1 required for STAT3 activation. A lack of effect of the Y924F and Y1990F mutations on cholesterol efflux despite a loss of STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B) indicates that the ABCA1-dependent activation of STAT3 plays no role in the cholesterol export function of ABCA1. This idea was further supported by studies showing that silencing of STAT3 with a siRNA had no effect of apoA-I-mediated cholesterol or phospholipid efflux (not shown). ABCA1 is induced by sterol-sensing LXR nuclear receptors and thus is expressed at high levels in cells that accumulate cholesterol, such as tissue macrophages. In macrophages, the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway has an anti-inflammatory function (9.Williams L.M. Sarma U. Willets K. Smallie T. Brennan F. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6965-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of apoA-I on expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines by ABCA1-expressing J774 macrophages. For these studies, we loaded cells with cholesterol and treated them with the LXR agonist TO901317 to induce ABCA1 (16.Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), incubated them without or with apoA-I for 3 h, incubated them for an additional 3 h without or with the inflammatory agent LPS in the absence of apoA-I, and measured the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNA. The purpose of these studies was to determine whether preincubating ABCA1-expressing macrophages with apoA-I affects subsequent cytokine production in response to LPS. In agreement with studies by others (17.Zelcer N. Tontonoz P. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), we found that pretreating these cells with the LXR agonist alone markedly suppressed the ability of LPS to induce TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (not shown). Despite this baseline suppression, however, exposing cells to LPS for 3 h still increased transcription of these cytokines by 2–4-fold (Fig. 4A). Although apoA-I had little effect on cytokine mRNA levels without LPS treatment, it markedly reduced the stimulatory effects of LPS (Fig. 4A). Thus, the interaction of apolipoproteins with ABCA1-expressing macrophages suppresses LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production. We used siRNA transfections to determine whether apoA-I is exerting its anti-inflammatory effects through STAT3. Results from three experiments showed that transfecting J774 macrophages with STAT3 siRNA reduced STAT3 protein levels by 50–60% when compared with cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA (Fig. 4B). The ability of apoA-I to reduce LPS-stimulated expression of TNF-α (or IL-6) was partially but significantly (p < 0.03) reversed by knocking down STAT3 (Fig. 4C). In this experiment, apoA-I decreased TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA levels by 46 and 56% in control cells, respectively, and this was reduced to 25 and 26% in STAT3 siRNA-transfected cells. These differences are comparable with the degree of silencing of STAT3 by the siRNA. These findings support the conclusion that apoA-I suppresses inflammation in J774 macrophages through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Because J774 macrophages were relatively resistant to silencing STAT3 with a siRNA, we used another macrophage cell line to confirm the involvement of STAT3 in the anti-inflammatory effects of apoA-I. With isolated mouse peritoneal macrophages, transfection with the same STAT3 siRNA reduced STAT3 protein levels by ∼80% (Fig. 4B). Also in contrast to J774 macrophages, we were able to induce ABCA1 to high levels by loading them with acetylated LDL-derived cholesterol without the need to treat them with an LXR agonist (data not shown). As with J774 macrophages, 3-h incubations of cholesterol-loaded peritoneal macrophages with apoA-I inhibited LPS-induced expression of both TNF-α and IL-6 (Fig. 4C). Transfecting cells with the STAT3 siRNA almost completely reversed the inhibitory effects of apoA-I on LPS-induced expression of TNF-α and IL-6 (Fig. 4C). Thus, our results show that apoA-I interactions with two different types of ABCA1-expressing macrophages inhibits inflammatory cytokine production by a STAT3-dependent process. To examine if activation of STAT3 is required for the anti-inflammatory effects of apoA-I/ABCA1 interactions, we treated macrophages with the cell-permeable STAT3 inhibitor peptide (18.Buettner C. Pocai A. Muse E.D. Etgen A.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Rossetti L. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This inhibitor markedly reduced STAT3 phosphorylation in cholesterol-loaded peritoneal macrophages without affecting total STAT3 protein levels (Fig. 4D). Whereas apoA-I reduced subsequent LPS-stimulated production of TNF-α and IL-6 by ∼60% in these cells, these apoA-I effects were reduced to less than 30% in the presence of the STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor (Fig. 4E). These findings support the idea that STAT3 activation is involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of apoA-I. We used cholesterol-loaded peritoneal macrophages from mice lacking macrophage STAT3 to further confirm a role of STAT3 in the apoA-I-mediated suppression of cytokine production. As an additional control, we compared the effects of apoA-I with those of IL-10, a cytokine receptor system that suppresses macrophage inflammation through STAT3 (9.Williams L.M. Sarma U. Willets K. Smallie T. Brennan F. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6965-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because general knock-out of STAT3 is embryonic lethal (19.Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar), we generated mice with STAT3 silenced specifically in myeloid cells by breeding STAT3fl/fl mice with a mouse Lys-M-Cre line, which is under control of the macrophage/granulocyte-specific lysozyme-M promoter. Immunoblots of peritoneal and bone marrow macrophages from these mice showed a complete absence of STAT3 as compared with cells from wild-type animals (STAT3wt/wt/Lys-M-Cre) or the whole population of white blood cells from STAT3fl/fl/Lys-M-Cre mice (Fig. 5A). Knocking out STAT3 markedly reduced the ability of apoA-I to suppress cytokine production from cholesterol-loaded peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 5B), supporting the idea that STAT3 plays a critical role in the anti-inflammatory effects of macrophage/apoA-I interactions. The ability of IL-10 to inhibit LPS-induced cytokine production was completely absent in cells lacking STAT3, consistent with IL-10 acting exclusively through STAT3. These findings show that apoA-I mimics IL-10 in suppressing inflammatory cytokine production by LPS-treated macrophages. We also confirmed a role of ABCA1 in the apoA-I-mediated suppression of cytokine production by measuring the effects of apoA-I on cholesterol-loaded peritoneal macrophages from ABCA1−/− mice. The ability of apoA-I to suppress production of TNF-α and IL-6 was absent in macrophages lacking ABCA1 (Fig. 5C), indicating a complete requirement for this transporter for the anti-inflammatory effects of apoA-I. We showed previously that the interaction of apoA-I and its mimetic peptides with ABCA1-expressing cells rapidly activates JAK2, and this enhances the direct interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 required for lipid removal from the cells (6.Tang C. Vaughan A.M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 107-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7.Tang C. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7622-7628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here we show that this interaction also activates the transcription factor STAT3, and this is independent of the lipid transport activity of ABCA1. STAT3 has an anti-inflammatory function in macrophages (9.Williams L.M. Sarma U. Willets K. Smallie T. Brennan F. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6965-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a major ABCA1-expressing cell type, and we found that the interaction of apoA-I with cholesterol-loaded macrophages suppressed LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines. Silencing STAT3 or ABCA1 in macrophages reduced the ability of apoA-I to inhibit cytokine production, indicating a critical role of these two proteins in the anti-inflammatory effects of apoA-I. These findings show that the interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1-expressing macrophages activates a JAK2/STAT3 pathway that has anti-inflammatory activity. The two intracellular loops of ABCA1 (NBDs) each contain a tetrameric amino acid motif (YXXQ) previously shown to create STAT3 docking sites in cytokine receptors (15.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Mutating these sites completely abolished the ability of apoA-I to activate and bind STAT3 without affecting the cholesterol export function of ABCA1, indicating that these sites are responsible for the apoA-I-mediated STAT3 activation. Remarkably, the site in NBD2 lies in a pentamer (GYPCQ) that has the identical sequence as the prototypic STAT3 docking site originally described for the gp130 subunit of cytokine receptors (15.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Mutating this site had the largest effect of preventing apoA-I from activating STAT3. Whereas the JAK2/STAT3 pathway is oncogenic and pro-inflammatory in many cell types (20.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar), it has an anti-inflammatory function in macrophages. Constitutive expression of active STAT3 in cultured macrophages nearly abolishes LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production (9.Williams L.M. Sarma U. Willets K. Smallie T. Brennan F. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6965-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Selective silencing of STAT3 in mouse macrophages and neutrophils increases susceptibility to endotoxic shock and promotes chronic entercolitis (21.Matsukawa A. Takeda K. Kudo S. Maeda T. Kagayama M. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6198-6205Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22.Matsukawa A. Kudo S. Maeda T. Numata K. Watanabe H. Takeda K. Akira S. Ito T. J.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 suppresses production of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages through STAT3, and IL-10 knock-out mice have chronic inflammation and increased atherosclerosis (24.Murray P.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2006; 6: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 25.Potteaux S. Esposito B. van Oostrom O. Brun V. Ardouin P. Groux H. Tedgui A. Mallat Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Here we found that pretreating ABCA1-expressing macrophages with apoA-I suppressed subsequent LPS-induced production of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. ApoA-I therefore primes ABCA1-expressing macrophages to resist LPS-induced inflammation. This effect of apoA-I was reduced by knocking down STAT3 with an siRNA, silencing STAT3 in myeloid-specific STAT3 knock-out mice, or inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation, indicating a role for STAT3 in the anti-inflammatory effects of apoA-I. A role for ABCA1 was confirmed by results showing that apoA-I lost its anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages from ABCA1−/− mice. Silencing STAT3 in macrophages did not completely reverse the ability of apoA-I to suppress LPS-induced cytokine production, indicating that some of the anti-inflammatory effects of apoA-I are independent of STAT3. Based on studies with macrophages lacking STAT3, it was estimated that 65% of the effects of apoA-I on LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production could be attributed to STAT3. It has been shown that the cholesterol export activity of apoA-I can also inhibit macrophage inflammatory cytokine production by disrupting sterol-rich membrane rafts (26.Zhu X. Lee J.Y. Timmins J.M. Brown J.M. Boudyguina E. Mulya A. Gebre A.K. Willingham M.C. Hiltbold E.M. Mishra N. Maeda N. Parks J.S. J. Biol.

It is therefore likely that apoA-I/ABCA1 interactions can suppress macrophage inflammation by multiple mechanisms. The availability of mutant forms of ABCA1 that lack the ability to activate STAT3 but retain lipid export activity will allow us to examine the contribution of these different mechanisms to the overall anti-inflammatory effects of apoA-I. There is controversy about whether or not selective deletion of macrophage ABCA1 modulates atherosclerosis. Transplantation of Abca1-deficient bone marrow into mice significantly reduced atherosclerosis (31.Aiello R.J. Brees D. Bourassa P.A. Royer L. Lindsey S. Coskran T. Haghpassand M. Francone O.L.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 6298-6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), but myeloid-specific silencing of ABCA1 in whole animals had no effect on atherosclerosis (33.Brunham L.R. Singaraja R.R. Duong M. Timmins J.M. Fievet C. Bissada N. Kang M.H. Samra A. Fruchart J.C. McManus B. Staels B. Parks J.S. Hayden M.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One explanation for these discrepancies might be related to the macrophage-like cell types that lack ABCA1 in the atherosclerotic lesions. Of particular interest is the fact that the myeloid-specific ablation of ABCA1 had little effect on the dendritic cell ABCA1, a cell type that may play an important role in atherogenesis (34.Galkina E. Ley K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Loading macrophages with cholesterol induces a dendritic cell phenotype (35.Cho H.J. Shashkin P. Gleissner C.A. Dunson D. Jain N. Lee J.K. Miller Y. Ley K. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 29: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and STAT3 negatively regulates dendritic cell function (36.Sun Y. Chin Y.E. Weisiger E. Malter C. Tawara I. Toubai T. Gatza E. Mascagni P. Dinarello C.A. Reddy P. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 5899-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is also not known if overexpression of ABCA1 in macrophages could have an anti-inflammatory effect. Taken together, the current and previous studies (5.Vaughan A.M. Tang C. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 285-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6.Tang C. Vaughan A.M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Oram J.F. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 7622-7628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) show that interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1-expressing cells rapidly activates JAK2, which in turn activates two independent pathways: lipid export from cells and STAT3-mediated transcription (Fig. 6). The observation that ABCA1 contains active STAT3 docking sites that allow it to function as a signaling receptor is a unique property among cell membrane transporters. One novel feature of ABCA1 compared with other eucharyotic transporters is that its export function requires direct molecular interactions between the transporter and the acceptor of the transported cargo. This creates the opportunity for ligand/receptor-like interactions to regulate both transport activity and signaling pathways. Studies of human HDL deficiencies and mouse models have shown that loss-of-function mutations in ABCA1 increase cardiovascular disease (4.Singaraja R.R. Brunham L.R. Visscher H. Kastelein J.J. Hayden M.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1322-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 31.Aiello R.J. Brees D. Bourassa P.A. Royer L. Lindsey S. Coskran T. Haghpassand M. Francone O.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This has been attributed to an impaired removal of excess cholesterol from macrophages by HDL apolipoproteins (37.Singaraja R.R. Visscher H. James E.R. Chroni A. Coutinho J.M. Brunham L.R. Kang M.H. Zannis V.I. Chimini G. Hayden M.R. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which would lead to accumulation of sterol-laden macrophages in the artery wall. Mice lacking ABCA1 in all tissues or selectively in macrophages have an enhanced inflammatory response to LPS (26.Zhu X. Lee J.Y. Timmins J.M. Brown J.M. Boudyguina E. Mulya A. Gebre A.K.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 972-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), implying that macrophage ABCA1 has an anti-inflammatory function in vivo and that this may contribute to its cardioprotective effects. Studies of isolated macrophages from these mice suggest that this may be secondary to the inability of ABCA1 to export lipids from cells, which modifies plasma membrane lipid rafts and enhances LPS signaling (27.Koseki M. Hirano K. Masuda D. Ikegami C. Tanaka M. Ota A. Sandoval J.C. Nakagawa-Toyama Y. Sato S.B. Kobayashi T. Shimada Y. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Matsuura F. Shimomura I. Yamashita S. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 299-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our studies show that ABCA1 can also directly suppress LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages through a STAT3 pathway that is independent of cholesterol export. This novel dual function of ABCA1 may have evolved as part of the innate immune system, particularly as a component of the resolution phase of inflammation (40.Serhan C.N. Savill J. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). Activated macrophages at sites of inflammation release inflammatory cytokines and phagocytose apoptotic cells, which contain cholesterol-rich membranes. An unchecked accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages can be cytotoxic and evoke exaggerated inflammatory responses (26.Zhu X. Lee J.Y. Timmins J.M. Brown J.M. Boudyguina E. Mulya A. Gebre A.K.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), thus promoting sustained tissue damage. The induction of ABCA1 by the accumulating cholesterol would divert the cholesterol from cells into the HDL pathway and prevent cytotoxicity and excessive inflammation. In parallel, the induced ABCA1 would resolve the inflammatory response through activation of JAK2/STAT3. The same process is likely to occur in atherosclerotic lesions, except that the major source of macrophage-engulfed cholesterol would be sterol-rich lipoproteins trapped in the artery wall. Thus, ABCA1 may be a direct link between the cardioprotective effects of cholesterol export and anti-inflammation. These findings also raise the interesting possibility that ABCA1 might have a protective role in other inflammatory disorders characterized by the local accumulation of macrophages.

CO distribution is tightly regulated: homolog pairs receive at least one CO, CO spacing is nonrandom, and COs occur preferentially in short genomic intervals called hotspots. We show that CO number and distribution are controlled on a chromosome-wide basis at the level of DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation by a condensin complex composed of subunits from two known condensins: the C. elegans dosage compensation complex and mitotic condensin II. Disruption of any subunit of the CO-controlling condensin dominantly changes DSB distribution, and thereby COs, and extends meiotic chromosome axes. These phenotypes are cosuppressed by disruption of a chromosome axis element. Our data implicate higher-order chromosome structure in the regulation of CO recombination, provide a model for the rapid evolution of CO hotspots, and show that reshuffling of interchangeable molecular parts can create independent machines with similar architectures but distinct biological functions.

In sexually reproducing organisms, reassortment of gene combinations occurs through crossover (CO) recombination, the reciprocal exchange of DNA between homologous parental chromosomes. COs increase the genetic diversity upon which natural selection acts, thereby facilitating evolution. COs occur during meiosis, a specialized cell division that produces haploid sperm and eggs from diploid progenitor cells through two successive rounds of chromosome segregation that follow one round of DNA replication. COs are not randomly distributed along a chromosome but instead occur preferentially in short intervals called “hotspots” (Kauppi et al., 2004Kauppi L. Jeffreys A.J. Keeney S.

In yeast, mice, and humans, recombination at hotspots occurs over intervals that range from 1 bp to 3 kb (de Massy et al., 1995de Massy B. Rocco V. Nicolas A.

Hotspots flank more evolutionarily stable regions known as haplotype blocks, which undergo recombination infrequently (Greenawalt et al., 2006Greenawalt D.M. Cui X. Wu Y. Lin Y. Wang H.Y. Luo M.

Mechanisms that dictate hotspot locations are poorly understood but of great interest, as hotspots determine the evolutionary landscape of the genome. Studies have defined local factors that regulate CO hotspot activity, but no single model explains hotspot activity at all locations. A hotspot can be controlled by local DNA sequence, chromatin state, DNA methylation, or a combination of such factors (Kauppi et al., 2004Kauppi L. Jeffreys A.J. Keeney S.

However, exclusively local regulation is in conflict with the evolutionary stability of hotspots (Boulton et al., 1997Boulton A. Myers R.S. Redfield R.J.

High-resolution mapping of crossovers reveals extensive variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among humans.Science. 2008; 319: 1395-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Such fluctuations are difficult to achieve by simultaneous reassortment of DNA polymorphisms at multiple loci. However, a polymorphism in one locus that exerts genome-wide effects could cause rapid, simultaneous fluctuations. Our work identifies a protein complex in the nematode C. elegans that mediates rapid fluctuations in CO sites. Disruption of any subunit causes a dominant change in the genome-wide distribution of COs in a single generation. CO hotspots correlate with hotspots for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), programmed events that initiate CO formation (Buhler et al., 2007Buhler C. Borde V. Lichten M.

CO distribution can, in principle, be controlled through DSB placement or a bias in the CO/NCO decision imposed after DSB formation, but the relative contribution of each mechanism is unknown. The CO/NCO decision has been considered the predominant determinant in CO distribution. Our work in C. elegans and recent work in yeast highlight the regulation of DSB placement in the control of CO distribution. A genome-wide study of yeast recombination showed that identifiable DSB repair products (COs and NCOs) are farther apart than expected by chance (Mancera et al., 2008Mancera E. Bourgon R. Brozzi A. Huber W. Steinmetz L.M. High-resolution mapping of meiotic crossovers and non-crossovers in yeast.Nature. 2008; 454: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Nonrandom positioning of COs and NCOs suggests that control of CO distribution might occur as early as DSB formation. We show that dramatic changes in DSB distribution in the nematode genome, under conditions that maintain or increase DSB number, correlate directly with changes in CO positions. Thus, CO regulation can occur at or before DSB formation. COs undergo another form of regulation to ensure that each pair of homologous chromosomes has at least one CO, termed the obligate CO (Jones, 1984Jones G.H. The control of chiasma distribution.Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1984; 38: 293-320PubMed Google Scholar). This regulation is essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis, because a CO forms the physical link, or chiasma, between homologs (Page and Hawley, 2003Page S.L. Hawley R.S. Chromosome choreography: the meiotic ballet.Science. 2003; 301: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Without such linkage, aneuploid gametes occur. In many species, the number of COs per chromosome is low (Jones, 1984Jones G.H. The control of chiasma distribution.Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1984; 38: 293-320PubMed Google Scholar). C. elegans is an extreme case: only one CO occurs per homolog pair (Hillers and Villeneuve, 2003Hillers K.J. Villeneuve A.M. Chromosome-wide control of meiotic crossing over in C. elegans.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1641-1647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Despite low CO frequency, chromosomes with no COs are extremely rare (Villeneuve, 1994Villeneuve A.M. A cis-acting locus that promotes crossing over between X chromosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1994; 136: 887-902PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies show that part of the mechanism to ensure an obligate CO occurs through DSB regulation. When multiple COs occur on a given chromosome, COs are spaced farther apart than predicted by chance, a phenomenon known as CO interference (Sturtevant, 1913Sturtevant A.H. The linear arrangement of six-sex linked factors in Drosophila, as shown by their mode of association.J. Exp. Zool. 1913; 14: 43-59Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Whether interference occurs at the level of DSB initiation or a more downstream step of CO regulation has not been fully assessed. Furthermore, the mechanistic relationship, if any, between CO interference and the obligate CO is not known. Our work shows not only that COs can be controlled on a chromosome-wide basis through DSB initiation, but also that DSB position is strongly influenced by meiotic chromosome structure. Our previous work identified the C. elegans protein DPY-28, which regulates X chromosome dosage compensation (DC) in somatic cells and meiotic CO number and distribution in germ cells (Tsai et al., 2008Tsai C.J. Mets D.G. Albrecht M.R. Nix P. Chan A. Meyer B.J. Meiotic crossover number and distribution are regulated by a dosage compensation protein that resembles a condensin subunit.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 194-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the soma, DPY-28 acts in the dosage compensation complex (DCC), which resembles condensin, a conserved protein complex that mediates global chromosome restructuring to achieve accurate chromosome segregation (Losada and Hirano, 2005Losada A.

Meiotic crossover number and distribution are regulated by a dosage compensation protein that resembles a condensin subunit.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 194-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that DPY-28 controls CO distribution by functioning in a third condensin complex defined concurrently in our work and that of Csankovszki et al., 2009Csankovszki G. Collette K. Spahl K. Carey J. Snyder M. Petty E. Patel U. Tabuchi T. Liu H. McLeod I. et al.Three distinct condensin complexes control C. elegans chromosome dynamics.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar. This complex is distinct from the two known C. elegans condensins—the DCC and mitotic condensin II—but contains subunits from both. Disrupting any subunit of the CO-controlling condensin changes the distribution of DSBs, and thereby COs, and also increases CO frequency by increasing DSBs. Also, disruption of a condensin II-specific subunit changes CO disribution, but in different chromosomal domains. Condensin subunit disruption dominantly extends chromosome axes, implying that chromosome structure imposed by condensin controls meiotic CO recombination by regulating DSB formation. To identify proteins that act with DPY-28 to control COs, we conducted biochemical (Figure 1) and genetic (Figure 2) experiments. We asked whether null alleles of DC genes dpy-26 and dpy-27 alter CO distribution and found that dpy-26 but not dpy-27 mutations shift COs toward the right end of X and increase CO frequency due to double and triple COs, like dpy-28 mutations (Figure 2A, and Figure S1A available online). Double COs were also higher on autosomes (Figure S1B).Figure 2Mutation of any Gene Encoding a Condensin I Subunit Increases CO Frequency and Shifts CO Distribution to the Right End of XShow full captionCO analysis of X in heterozygous condensin I mutants using snip-SNPs.

(B) γ-irradiation increases the number of COs on the left end of X and has an additive effect on CO frequency when combined with dpy-28 or dpy-26 mutations. Immunoprecipitation (IP) reactions performed with DPY-26 antibodies and protein extracts from mixed-stage animals then defined additional proteins that control COs. IPs were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and proteins identified by mass spectrometry (Figure 1A, Table S1). As expected, the DPY-26 IP recovered subunits DPY-26, DPY-27, DPY-28 from the DCC condensin core (condensin IDC), and MIX-1, a subunit shared by condensin IDC and condensin II. Unexpectedly, the IP also recovered condensin II subunit SMC-4, suggesting that DPY-26 acts in a complex distinct from the DCC and that subunits of two different condensins act together in a third condensin complex. Protein interactions were confirmed by reciprocal IPs and western blot analysis (Figures 1B–1D). In coIPs, SMC-4 antibodies recovered DPY-26, and antibodies to condensin IDC subunits DPY-26, DPY-28, and CAPG-1 recovered SMC-4, confirming the association of DC proteins with condensin II subunits. Although the DC protein CAPG-1 was not detected in the initial IP, it was detected in all subsequent IPs. Controls verify the composition of this third condensin complex, named condensin I, which differs from condensin IDC by substituting SMC-4 for DPY-27 (Figure 1E). Antibodies to the DC-specific SMC protein DPY-27 did not recover SMC-4 (Figure 1D). Antibodies to condensin II subunit HCP-6, a paralog of DPY-28, recovered SMC-4 but not DPY-26, showing that DPY-26 does not interact with all condensin II subunits (Figures 1C and 1D). Furthermore, neither DPY-26 nor SMC-4 was detected in IPs using antibodies to SMC-3, a subunit of cohesin, an SMC-containing complex that achieves chromosome cohesion and binds to chromosomes throughout meiosis. Thus, protein interactions identified by IPs are likely to be direct rather than mediated though DNA (Figures 1C and 1D). Together, these results suggest that DPY-28 controls CO distribution through its action in a condensin complex distinct from condensin IDC and condensin II, but composed of subunits from both (Figure 1E): the two SMC proteins MIX-1 and SMC-4 from mitotic condensin II (Hagstrom et al., 2002Hagstrom K.A. Holmes V.F. Cozzarelli N.R. Meyer B.J.

Meiotic crossover number and distribution are regulated by a dosage compensation protein that resembles a condensin subunit.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 194-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Concurrent studies also identified condensin I and showed it functions in mitosis (Csankovszki et al., 2009Csankovszki G. Collette K. Spahl K. Carey J. Snyder M. Petty E. Patel U. Tabuchi T. Liu H. McLeod I. et al.Three distinct condensin complexes control C. elegans chromosome dynamics.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). If all components of the biochemically defined condensin I complex act together in vivo to control COs, mutations that disrupt the function of any subunit should perturb COs similarly to dpy-26 and dpy-28 mutations. This premise held true. COs were assessed by examination of the segregation of snip-SNP markers, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Scoring snip-SNPs along individual chromosomes allowed us to monitor three aspects of CO recombination: CO frequency in a given interval, distribution of COs, and the number of COs on a single chromatid. Six snip-SNPs were used to assay a 40 cM interval corresponding to 80% of X. Since dpy-28 mutations have a dominant effect on CO distribution (Tsai et al., 2008Tsai C.J. Mets D.G. Albrecht M.R. Nix P. Chan A. Meyer B.J. Meiotic crossover number and distribution are regulated by a dosage compensation protein that resembles a condensin subunit.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 194-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), comparison could be made using heterozygous mutations, thus averting complications from recessive lethality. Animals heterozygous for a null allele of any gene encoding a condensin I subunit showed a striking shift in the CO distribution to the right side of X (Figures 2A and S1). The CO frequency was increased ∼2- to 3-fold (p < 0.005, Fisher's exact test) in the D–F interval of dpy-28/+, dpy-26/+, mix-1/+, smc-4/+, and capg-1/+ mutants compared to that of wild-type animals. However, the CO pattern of animals heterozygous or homozygous for a null allele of DC gene dpy-27 resembled that of wild-type animals, indicating that disruption of condensin IDC does not shift the CO pattern. Thus, condensins that differ by only one subunit function in dramatically different chromosome-wide processes: dosage compensation and meiotic CO control. In addition to altering CO distribution, condensin I disruption increased the number of double (2-CO) and triple (3-CO) crossovers (Figure 2A). Wild-type C. elegans exhibits tight control of meiotic COs. With rare exception, one CO occurs per homolog pair. In our experiments, wild-type animals had one CO per X homolog pair. In contrast, dpy-26/+ mutants had 14 2-COs and one 3-CO in 92 X homologs, while mix-1/+ mutants had 14 2-COs and four 3-COs in 95 X homologs (p < 1 × 10−5, Fisher's exact test). CO numbers resemble those of dpy-28(s939)/+ mutants, which had 11 2-COs and two 3-COs on 94 X homologs. In contrast, disruption of condensin IDC did not alter CO number: dpy-27/+ and dpy-27/dpy-27 mutants had wild-type CO levels (Figure 2A). These genetic experiments corroborate the conclusion from biochemical experiments that DPY-28 acts in a condensin complex made of subunits from two condensins: one that controls gene repression and one that controls chromosome segregation. Moreover, these experiments show that a condensin complex restricts meiotic CO number and distribution, a role previously unknown for condensins. Depleting any condensin I subunit causes redistribution of COs, permitting us to ask whether the shift in CO position correlated with a change in DSB position. DSB distribution was compared along the length of X chromosomes in wild-type animals and mutants homozygous for the dpy-28(y283) partial loss-of-function allele, which dramatically shifts CO position without changing CO number (Figures 3 and 2A). DSBs were marked with an antibody to RAD-51, a RecA homolog that binds to nascent recombination intermediates just after DSB formation (Alpi et al., 2003Alpi A. Pasierbek P. Gartner A. Loidl J. Genetic and cytological characterization of the recombination protein RAD-51 in Caenorhabditis elegans.Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, Ogawa et al., 1993Ogawa T. Shinohara A. Nabetani A. Ikeya T. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Ogawa H. RecA-like recombination proteins in eukaryotes: functions and structures of RAD51 genes.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Meiotic chromosomes were labeled with antibodies to the axis marker HTP-3 and two fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes corresponding to the center and right end of X (Figure 3A). Positions of RAD-51 foci were scored relative to the FISH probes on chromosomes in which the axis (HTP-3) was traced in three dimensions (3D). Direct correlation between DSB and CO positions predicts a decrease in RAD-51 foci on the left end of X, where CO frequency is reduced and the genetic map compressed in mutants, and an increase in RAD-51 foci on the right end, where CO frequency is increased and the map expanded. The prediction was met. In dpy-28(y283) mutants, COs decreased dramatically in the genetic interval A–D, and the percentage of total RAD-51 foci decreased correspondingly, from 44% in wild-type animals to 3% in y283 mutants (p < 1 × 10−3, Fisher's exact test) (red interval, Figures 3B and 3C). In contrast, COs increased dramatically in the D–F interval, and the total RAD-51 foci increased from 50% to 80% (p < 0.002, Fisher's exact test) (blue interval, Figures 3B and 3C). The strong correlation between the locations of COs and RAD-51 foci in wild-type and mutant animals suggests that condensin I regulates COs by influencing DSB position. In broader perspective, mutation of a single gene can dramatically alter the landscape of CO hotspots along an entire chromosome, a phenomenon that suggests a model for rapid changes in hotspot usage. Consistent with a DSB increase causing the CO increase in condensin I mutants, we found that disrupting any condensin I subunit, but not condensin IDC subunit DPY-27, increased RAD-51 foci (see below, and Figures S2 and S5L). However, three models can explain this increase: condensin I disruption could increase the total number of DSBs, slow the repair of DSBs, or increase the proportion of DSBs being repaired through RAD-51 intermediates. The latter model is unlikely, as repair pathways not involving RAD-51 are rarely utilized in C. elegans meiosis (Martin et al., 2005Martin J.S. Winkelmann N. Petalcorin M.I. McIlwraith M.J. Boulton S.J. RAD-51-dependent and -independent roles of a Caenorhabditis elegans BRCA2-related protein during DNA double-strand break repair.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3127-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We combined two new approaches to distinguish between the other two models and found an increase in DSBs: (1) We developed an independent assay, the TUNEL assay, to monitor DSBs directly (Figure 4), and (2) we found mutant conditions (rad-54) that block DSB repair and hence trap DSBs and DSB-bound RAD-51 proteins. In the TUNEL assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase attached fluorescently labeled nucleotides to exposed 3′ ends of DSBs. Assay specificity was shown by the absence of foci in spo-11 mutants, which lack the DSB-forming type II topoisomerase (Figures 4A and 4B) (Dernburg et al., 1998Dernburg A.F. McDonald K. Moulder G.

Quantification showed good agreement between TUNEL and RAD-51 foci in singly labeled germlines (Figures 4D and 4E). Throughout pachytene, levels of TUNEL and RAD-51 foci were similar. As expected, more TUNEL than RAD-51 foci were found in two germline regions: the premeiotic region, where DNA nicks occur during replication, and the transition zone (leptotene/zygotene) (Figure 4D), where the onset of DSB formation precedes RAD-51 binding (Padmore et al., 1991Padmore R.

Ribosome biogenesis is a very complex process involving transcriptional as well as many post-transcriptional steps to produce functional ribosomes. It is now well demonstrated that ribosome production is enhanced in cancer cells and that ribosome biogenesis plays a crucial role in tumor progression. However, at present there is an important lack of data to determine whether the entire process of ribosome biogenesis and ribosome assembly is modified during tumor progression and what could be the potential impact on the dysregulation of translational control that is observed in cancer cells. In breast cancer cells displaying enhanced aggressivity, both in vitro and in vivo, we have analyzed the major steps of ribosome biogenesis and the translational capacity of the resulting ribosome. We show that increased tumorigenicity was associated with modifications of nucleolar morphology and profound quantitative and qualitative alterations in ribosomal biogenesis and function. Specifically cells with enhanced tumor aggressivity displayed increased synthesis of 45S pre-rRNA, with activation of an alternative preRNA synthetic pathway containing a 43S precursor and enhanced post-transcriptional methylation of specifc sites located in the 28S rRNA. While the global translational activity was not modified, IRES-initiated translation, notably that of p53 mRNA, was less efficient and the control of translational fidelity was importantly reduced in cells with increased aggressivity. These results suggest that acquisition of enhanced tumor aggressivity can be associated with profound qualitative alterations in ribosomal control, leading to reduced quality control of translation in cancer cells"

All the spermatocyte-specific GPx4 knock-out male mice were found to be infertile despite normal plug formation after mating and displayed a significant decrease in the number of spermatozoa. Isolated epididymal GPx4-null spermatozoa could not fertilize oocytes in vitro. These spermatozoa showed significant reductions of forward motility and the mitochondrial membrane potential. These impairments were accompanied by the structural abnormality, such as a hairpin-like flagella bend at the midpiece and swelling of mitochondria in the spermatozoa. These results demonstrate that the depletion of GPx4 in spermatocytes causes severe abnormalities in spermatozoa. This may be one of the causes of male infertility in mice and humans."

https://openalex.org/W1994585497,"Apoptosis depends upon the activation of intracellular caspases which are classically induced by either an intrinsic (mitochondrial based) or extrinsic (cytokine) pathway. However, in the process of explaining how endotoxin activated monocytes are able to induce apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells when co-cultured, we uncovered a transcellular apoptosis inducing pathway that utilizes caspase-1 containing microvesicles. Endotoxin stimulated monocytes induce the cell death of VSMCs but this activity is found in 100,000 g pellets of cell free supernatants of these monocytes. This activity is not a direct effect of endotoxin, and is inhibited by the caspase-1 inhibitor YVADcmk but not by inhibitors of Fas-L, IL-1beta and IL-18. Importantly, the apoptosis inducing activity co-purifies with 100 nm sized microvesicles as determined by TEM of the pellets. These microvesicles contain caspase-1 and caspase-1 encapsulation is required since disruption of microvesicular integrity destroys the apoptotic activity but not the caspase-1 enzymatic activity. Thus, monocytes are capable of delivering a cell death message which depends upon the release of microvesicles containing functional caspase-1. This transcellular apoptosis induction pathway describes a novel pathway for inflammation induced programmed cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1981137592,"Background Little is known about treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in high HIV-prevalence settings such as sub-Saharan Africa. Methodology/Principal Findings We did a retrospective analysis of early outcomes of the first cohort of patients registered in the Lesotho national MDR-TB program between July 21, 2007 and April 21, 2008. Seventy-six patients were included for analysis. Patient follow-up ended when an outcome was recorded, or on October 21, 2008 for those still on treatment. Fifty-six patients (74%) were infected with HIV; the median CD4 cell count was 184 cells/μl (range 5–824 cells/μl). By the end of the follow-up period, study patients had been followed for a median of 252 days (range 12–451 days). Twenty-two patients (29%) had died, and 52 patients (68%) were alive and in treatment. In patients who did not die, culture conversion was documented in 52/54 patients (96%). One patient had defaulted, and one patient had transferred out. Death occurred after a median of 66 days in treatment (range 12–374 days). Conclusions/Significance In a region where clinicians and program managers are increasingly confronted by drug-resistant tuberculosis, this report provides sobering evidence of the difficulty of MDR-TB treatment in high HIV-prevalence settings. In Lesotho, an innovative community-based treatment model that involved social and nutritional support, twice-daily directly observed treatment and early empiric use of second-line TB drugs was successful in reducing mortality of MDR-TB patients. Further research is urgently needed to improve MDR-TB treatment outcomes in high HIV-prevalence settings."

However, it is still unknown how the Atg16L1 variant contributes to disease development. The Atg16L1 protein possesses a C-terminal WD repeat domain whose function is entirely unknown, and the Crohn disease-associated mutation (T300A) is within this domain. To elucidate the function of the WD repeat domain, we established an experimental system in which a WD repeat domain mutant of Atg16L1 is stably expressed in Atg16L1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Using the system, we show that the Atg16L1 complex forms a dimeric complex and that the total Atg16L1 protein level is strictly maintained, possibly by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Furthermore, we show that an Atg16L1 WD repeat domain deletion and the T300A mutant have little impact on canonical autophagy and autophagy against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Therefore, we propose that Atg16L1 T300A is differentially involved in Crohn disease and canonical autophagy. A single nucleotide polymorphism in Atg16L1, an autophagy-related gene (ATG), is a risk factor for Crohn disease, a major form of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. However, it is still unknown how the Atg16L1 variant contributes to disease development. The Atg16L1 protein possesses a C-terminal WD repeat domain whose function is entirely unknown, and the Crohn disease-associated mutation (T300A) is within this domain. To elucidate the function of the WD repeat domain, we established an experimental system in which a WD repeat domain mutant of Atg16L1 is stably expressed in Atg16L1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

Macroautophagy, referred to here as autophagy, is an intracellular process in which the cytosol and organelles are sequestered within double membrane-bound structures, called autophagosomes, which deliver their contents to the lysosome/vacuole for degradation (1.Yoshimori T. Noda T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition to its physiological role in recycling intracellular materials as a starvation response, there is growing evidence that autophagy plays a role in many diverse biological phenomena, such as cellular immunity (2.Mizushima N.

The Atg16L1 protein consists of an N-terminal domain involved in Atg5 binding, a central coiled-coil domain required for self-oligomerization, and a C-terminal WD repeat domain whose role is entirely unknown (4.Mizushima N.

Recent genome-wide association studies have linked autophagy with Crohn disease, a major form of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (7.Hampe J. Franke A. Rosenstiel P. Till A. Teuber M. Huse K.

A single nucleotide polymorphism in Atg16L1 (T300A) is a risk factor for Crohn disease and resides in the WD repeat domain (7.Hampe J. Franke A. Rosenstiel P. Till A. Teuber M. Huse K. Albrecht M.

However, it is still unknown how the Atg16L1 variant contributes to the development of Crohn disease. ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase Earle's balanced salt solution mouse embryonic fibroblast Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium Stokes radius sedimentation coefficient. Crohn disease is one form of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease and develops predominantly at anatomical sites where commensal bacteria are dramatically increased in mass (10.Xavier R.J. Podolsky D.K. Nature. 2007; 448: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (3262) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is thought that bacterial flora has a crucial impact on the onset of Crohn disease, although this relationship is not well understood. The latest genome-wide association breakthroughs have expanded the role of innate immunity components beyond the already implicated Nod2 (11.Kanneganti T.D. Lamkanfi M. Núñez G. Immunity. 2007; 27: 549-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) to include autophagy based on the association of Atg16L1 with an autophagy-linked factor, immunity-related GTPase M (12.Singh S.B. Davis A.S. Taylor G.A. Deretic V. Science. 2006; 313: 1438-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). These associations suggest that the Atg16L1 T300A mutant may alter the antibacterial machinery that incorporates Atg16L1. A study using Atg16L1 knockdown cells and transient expression of small interference-resistant Atg16L1 constructs reported that the T300A mutant is fully functional in canonical autophagy but is less able to recruit LC3 to invading Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) (13.Kuballa P. Huett A. Rioux J.D. Daly M.J. Xavier R.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, because only a very small amount of the Atg16L1 complex is sufficient for full autophagic activity, residual levels of Atg16L1 may affect these interpretations (14.Hosokawa N. Hara Y. Mizushima N. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2623-2629PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, transient expression of Atg16L1 severely inhibits autophagy (5.Fujita N. Itoh T. Omori H. Fukuda M. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to establish an experimental system that enables us to reliably analyze the function of the Atg16L1 WD repeat domain. We have previously generated Atg16L1-deficient mice and demonstrated that Atg16L1 is indispensible for autophagosome formation (15.Saitoh T. Fujita N. Jang M.H. Uematsu S. Yang B.G. Satoh T. Omori H. Noda T. Yamamoto N. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Kawai T. Tsujimura T. Takeuchi O. Yoshimori T. Akira S. Nature. 2008; 456: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Therefore, Atg16L1-deficient cells should enable us to dissect the function of various exogenously expressed Atg16L1 mutants, such as a point mutant or deletion construct. In this report, we used an Atg16L1 reconstitution system to examine the biochemical nature of the Atg16L1 complex and analyze the function of the WD repeat domain that contains the Crohn disease-associated mutation (T300A). Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. The following antibodies were used: anti-human Atg5 (16.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), anti-mouse Atg16L1 (4.Mizushima N. Kuma A. Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto A. Matsubae M. Takao T. Natsume T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), anti-p62 (BIOMOL), anti-LC3 (Medical and Biological Laboratories), and anti-α-tubulin (clone B5-1-2, Sigma). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. pMRX-IRES-puro was a kind gift from Dr. S. Yamaoka (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan) (17.Saitoh T. Nakayama M. Nakano H. Yagita H. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36005-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To generate recombinant retroviruses, cDNAs corresponding to human Atg16L1β (isoform-1) constructs, including full-length (1–607), ΔWD repeat domain (1–249), and the Crohn disease-associated mutant (T300A), were subcloned into the pMRX-IRES-puro vector. Recombinant retroviruses were prepared as described previously (17.Saitoh T. Nakayama M. Nakano H. Yagita H. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36005-36012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Plat-E cells were generously provided by Dr. T. Kitamura (The University of Tokyo) (18.Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Wild-type, Atg5-deficient, and Atg16L1-deficient MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and the appropriate antibiotics in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For nutrient starvation, cells were cultured in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS, Invitrogen) for 1 h. Transient transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Stable transformants were selected in growth medium with 1 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) (19.Sou Y.S. Tanida I. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3017-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with 1% skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20/Trix-buffered saline and incubated with primary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) and luminol solution (1.25 mm luminol, 65 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm coumaric acid, 0.01% H2O2). Cells were cultured on coverslips and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were examined under a fluorescence laser scanning confocal microscope, FV1000 (Olympus). Gel-filtration analysis was performed as previously described (4.Mizushima N. Kuma A. Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto A. Matsubae M. Takao T. Natsume T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Briefly, MEFs were homogenized in homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) by repeatedly passing (∼15 times) through a 1-ml syringe with a 23-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting supernatants (cytosol fraction) were separated by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). The cytosol fraction was prepared as described in the gel-filtration section. Two-hundred microliters of the cytosol fraction was loaded on the top of discontinuous stepwise sucrose gradients. The gradient was composed of 1 ml each of stepwise sucrose solutions (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30%). The samples were sedimented for 16 h at 100,000 × g, and then 0.6-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Calibration of the gradient was performed using catalase, aldolase, and bovine serum albumin. The bulk protein degradation assay was performed as previously described (20.Fujita N. Hayashi-Nishino M. Fukumoto H. Omori H. Yamamoto A. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4651-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (SR-11 × 3181) was provided by the Research Institute of Microbial Disease, Osaka University (Osaka, Japan). Bacterial infections were performed as previously described (21.Birmingham C.L. Smith A.C. Bakowski M.A. Yoshimori T. Brumell J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11374-11383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). A colony forming assay was performed as follows. Cells were infected with S. typhimurium (multiplicity of infection = 100) for 10 min. After treating infected cells with gentamicin for 0, 2, or 6 h, the cells were lysed and serially diluted, and lysates were plated to determine the viable bacterial numbers. All values shown in the figures are represented with standard deviation. To examine the role of the WD repeat domain in Atg16L1, we constructed an Atg16L1 mutant that lacked the WD repeat domain and the T300A mutant (Fig. 1A). These mutants were stably expressed in Atg16L1-deficient (Δ/Δ) MEFs using a retrovirus expression system. We previously generated Atg16L1-deficient mice that are completely defective in autophagy (15.Saitoh T. Fujita N. Jang M.H. Uematsu S. Yang B.G. Satoh T. Omori H. Noda T. Yamamoto N. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Kawai T. Tsujimura T. Takeuchi O. Yoshimori T. Akira S. Nature. 2008; 456: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). The MEFs derived from Atg16L1-Δ/Δ mice express deleted forms of the Atg16L1 protein that lack the entire coiled-coil domain, which is involved in Atg16L1 multimerization and is essential for Atg16L1 function (15.Saitoh T. Fujita N. Jang M.H. Uematsu S. Yang B.G. Satoh T. Omori H. Noda T. Yamamoto N. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Kawai T. Tsujimura T. Takeuchi O. Yoshimori T. Akira S. Nature. 2008; 456: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Two truncated splicing variants, termed Atg16L1-α′ and β′, were detected in the MEF cell lysates by Western blotting with an anti-Atg16L1 antibody (15.Saitoh T. Fujita N. Jang M.H. Uematsu S. Yang B.G. Satoh T. Omori H. Noda T. Yamamoto N. Komatsu M. Tanaka K. Kawai T. Tsujimura T. Takeuchi O. Yoshimori T. Akira S. Nature. 2008; 456: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). However, these bands were scarcely detectable in Atg16L1-Δ/ΔMEFs stably expressing exogenous wild-type Atg16L1, T300A, or the ΔWD mutant (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, although two spliced variants, Atg16L1-α and -β, were expressed in wild-type MEFs, the endogenous α form became the least detectable upon the exogenous overexpression of human Atg16L1-β (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that there is an upper limit of total Atg16L1 protein expression that is maintained within cells. Treating with proteasome inhibitors increased the level of Atg16L1-α′, -β′, and ectopically expressed Atg16L1 proteins in Atg16L1-Δ/ΔMEFs that were stably expressing the exogenous Atg16L1β constructs (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system helps control the Atg16L1 protein level. Because the Atg16L1 protein level was drastically reduced when Atg5 was knocked out (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S2A), Atg16L1 molecules that were free from Atg12-Atg5 seemed to be unstable. We also observed that ectopic expression of GFP-Atg5 or treatment with the proteasome inhibitor increased the Atg16L1 protein level in Atg5 knockout MEFs (supplemental Fig. S2). Consistently, all of the Atg16L1 comigrates with the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate in a gel-filtration profile of wild-type cells (5.Fujita N. Itoh T. Omori H. Fukuda M. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Thus, the total Atg16L1 protein level was tightly correlated with the amount of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate. Because Atg16L1-ΔCCD had a lower affinity for the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate than Atg16L1, which contained the coiled-coil domain (supplemental Fig. S3), Atg16L1-ΔCCD was preferentially degraded in Atg16L1-reconstituted cells. Thus, we successfully obtained cells that expressed endogenous levels of the ΔWD or T300A mutant that were suitable for further analysis. Next, we asked if the ΔWD mutant forms a multimeric complex like wild-type Atg16L1. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate and Atg16L1 are supposed to form a multimer, probably an octamer, because both Atg16L1 (68 kDa) and the Atg12-Atg5 (50 kDa) conjugate eluted primarily in the ∼800-kDa fractions by size-exclusion chromatography (4.Mizushima N. Kuma A. Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto A. Matsubae M. Takao T. Natsume T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The cytosol fraction of wild-type MEFs, Atg16L1-Δ/ΔMEFs (which express ΔCCD), and Atg16L1-Δ/ΔMEFs stably expressing Atg16L1-ΔWD were subjected to gel filtration. First, considering the molecular mass of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate (∼50 kDa) and Atg16L1-ΔCCD (∼54 kDa), the complex in Atg16L1-Δ/Δ cells was expected to be ∼100 kDa. However, Atg16L1-ΔCCD eluted in fractions corresponding to ∼300 kDa (Fig. 2B). Second, although the molecular mass of Atg16L1-ΔWD (31 kDa) is much less than that of full-length Atg16L1 (68 kDa), the main fractions in which Atg16L1-ΔWD eluted were very similar to wild-type (Atg16L1-ΔWD molecules lacking Atg12-Atg5 conjugate were eluted in fractions 13 and 14 in Fig. 2C as a minor peak) (Fig. 2, A and C). These paradoxical results prompted us to closely examine the detailed organization of the Atg16L1 complex. Gel filtration actually measures the Stokes radius (RS), a property that depends on the mass, shape, and hydration of a protein. Thus, using gel filtration as the only means to determine a molecular weight can be misleading. However, when a Stokes radius (RS) is measured by size-exclusion chromatography and a sedimentation coefficient (S) determined by density gradient centrifugation, the molecular weight of a protein can be calculated independent of its shape and hydration (22.Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). To precisely determine the molecular weight of the Atg16L1 complex, we performed sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The apparent molecular weight of the Atg16L1 complex in the sucrose density gradient centrifugation was much less than that obtained from the gel-filtration analysis (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The difference in the apparent molecular weight between the two methods might be due to the high concentration of sucrose in the gradient. To exclude this possibility, Tris-buffered saline with 20% sucrose was used as the gel-filtration running buffer. As shown in supplemental Fig. S4, even in the presence of 20% sucrose, the Atg16L1 complex primarily eluted in fractions corresponding to ∼800 kDa.TABLE 1Physicochemical properties of the Atg16L1 complexConstructMtheor., Atg16L1 (+Atg12–5)Gel filtrationSucrose density gradientMcalc.Stokes radiusMapp.Sedimentation coefficientMapp.kDaÅkDaskDakDaFull68 (116)908006.3120238ΔCCD54 (102)583004.570110ΔWD31 (79)867004.570162 Open table in a new tab The Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient for the Atg16L1 complexes were determined from standard curves (supplemental Fig. S5 and Table 1). Then, the molecular weight of each complex was calculated using the Siegel and Monty equation (Table 1) (22.Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass of the Atg16L1-ΔCCD complex was nearly equal to the combined molecular weight of each single subunit. Furthermore, the calculated molecular mass of the Atg16L1 complex in both wild-type MEFs and Atg16L1-ΔWD-expressing MEFs was very close to double the molecular weight of the monomer. Therefore, we concluded that the Atg16L1 complex exists as a dimer and that the WD repeat domain is dispensable for this dimer formation. Based on these biochemical characterizations of the Atg16L1 complex, we confirmed that we successfully established an experimental system expressing an exogenous WD repeat domain mutant with a native organization. Next, we analyzed the role of the WD repeat domain. To explore the role of the WD repeat domain and the Crohn disease-associated point mutation (T300A), we immunostained for Atg16L1. Upon nutrient starvation, Atg16L1 puncta formed in Atg16L1-Δ/ΔMEFs stably expressing the T300A mutant or ΔWD to a similar extent as wild-type cells or full-length-reconstituted cells (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating that the WD repeat domain is dispensable for the localization of the Atg16L1 complex. The LC3 puncta also formed under starvation, and a significant difference was not observed with both WD repeat mutants (Fig. 4, C and D). The level of LC3-II formation was not significantly altered in starved condition, although the LC3-II level was decreased in the fed ΔWD mutant-reconstituted cells (Fig. 5A), indicating that the E3-like function of the Atg16L1 complex was hardly affected by both mutants.FIGURE 5Impact of the Atg16L1 WD repeat deletion mutant and T300A mutant on autophagic degradation. A and B, Atg16L1-Δ/ΔMEFs expressing the indicated constructs were cultured in growth medium (+) or EBSS (−) for 1 h and then collected. Total cell lysate samples were examined by Western blot using each antibody. From top to bottom, panels represent anti-Atg16L1, anti-p62, anti-LC3, and anti-α-tubulin. The asterisk indicates a nonspecific immunoreactive band (A). The graph indicates the ratio between the intensity of the p62 band versus α-tubulin band expressed as a percentage of that in fed empty reconstituted cells. The average ± S.D. is shown for two independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's t test: **, p < 0.01; NS, not significant (B). C, wild-type or Atg16L1-Δ/ΔMEFs expressing the indicated constructs were grown in growth medium (Fed) or EBSS (Starved) for 2 h. Long-lived protein degradation was scored by a standard protocol. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test: *, p < 0.05; NS, not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Abnormal accumulation of p62 is a well known index for impaired basal autophagic activity (23.Kimura S. Fujita N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), p62 accumulation in Atg16L1-Δ/Δ MEFs was suppressed by expression of the T300A mutant or ΔWD to almost the same extent as wild type. We also confirmed that the T300A mutation and WD repeat deletion mutant had little effect on starvation-induced autophagic flow in a bulk protein degradation assay (Fig. 5C). Collectively, we conclude that the WD repeat domain in Atg16L1 is dispensable for canonical autophagy. There is strong evidence that enteric microflora play a central role in the initiation and maintenance of Crohn disease (10.Xavier R.J. Podolsky D.K. Nature. 2007; 448: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (3262) Google Scholar). One function of autophagy in mammalian cells is to eliminate invasive microbes (3.Virgin H.W. Levine B. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Because the WD repeat domain is absent in yeast, it may be important for a specialized form of autophagy, such as an antibacterial function. To test this possibility, Atg16L1-reconstituted cells were challenged with S. typhimurium. We previously showed that Atg16L1-Δ/Δ macrophages fail to recruit LC3 around S. typhimurium. However, infection with S. typhimurium did not induce a marked difference in LC3 recruitment between full-length-, T300A mutant-, and ΔWD-reconstituted cells (Fig. 6, A and B). A similar result was obtained with group A Streptococcus challenge (supplemental Fig. S6). Although it has been reported that T300A mutant is less stable than wild type after bacterial challenge (13.Kuballa P. Huett A. Rioux J.D. Daly M.J. Xavier R.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), the total T300A mutant protein level was not affected after S. typhimurium challenge in our experimental system (supplemental Fig. S7). In addition, there were no differences in the half-life among them (supplemental Fig. S8). The disagreement might be due to the difference in cell types that we used. To further examine the effect of the T300A mutant or WD repeat deletion on bacterial growth arrest, colony forming assays were performed. It has been previously reported that the loss of autophagy enhances S. typhimurium replication within cells (21.Birmingham C.L. Smith A.C. Bakowski M.A. Yoshimori T. Brumell J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11374-11383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, Atg16L1-Δ/ΔMEFs harbored significantly more viable bacteria than wild-type cells. However, we observed no significant differences between full-length-, T300A mutant-, and ΔWD-reconstituted cells (Fig. 6C). Collectively, the results clearly indicate the autophagic process against invading bacteria proceeds normally with the T300A and ΔWD mutants. In this study, we characterized the biochemical properties of the Atg16L1 complex to establish a reliable experimental system that can be used to explore the function of the WD repeat domain in Atg16L1. Using Atg16L1-deficient cells, we revealed that Atg16L1 and the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate form a dimeric complex and that the total Atg16L1 protein level is strictly maintained, possibly by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Unassembled Atg16L1 protein is eliminated, suggesting that Atg16L1 molecule functions as a complex with Atg12-Atg5 conjugate and may not have a role outside the complex. Based on the perspective that cells want to maximize their amino acid resources, it is reasonable to assume that cells would recycle surplus non-functional subunits. Furthermore, this degradation mechanism is important for efficient autophagy, because abrupt overexpression of Atg16L1 by an adenovirus expression system severely inhibits autophagy, possibly by titrating out some interactor (5.Fujita N. Itoh T. Omori H. Fukuda M. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). This kind of fine-tuning of the molecular abundance may be one of the general roles of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and molecular chaperones such as HSP90 may participate in these processes (24.McClellan A.J. Scott M.D. Frydman J. Cell. 2005; 121: 739-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The Siegel and Monty equation provided a highly rational model for the organization of the Atg16L1 complex. The discrepancy between the Stokes radius in a gel-filtration analysis and the calculated value from the Siegel and Monty equation is potentially caused by the Atg16L1 complex having an elongated rather than a globular shape. The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal region of yeast Atg16 bound to the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate has been reported (25.Matsushita M. Suzuki N.N. Obara K. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6763-6772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Atg5 contains two ubiquitin fold domains, and Atg12, which also contains a ubiquitin fold, is conjugated in between these domains (26.Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Because deleting the WD repeat domain does not lead to a major decrease in the Stokes radius compared with full-length Atg16L1, we speculate that Atg16L1 forms an antiparallel dimer. In this state, the Atg16L1 complex takes on a cylindrical shape, possessing three ubiquitin folds at the both ends. We have clearly shown that the WD repeat domain is dispensable for canonical autophagy and antibacterial autophagy in fibroblasts. This finding is surprising, because the WD repeat domain is highly conserved in multicellular eukaryotes, including Caenorhabditis elegans and plants. This high conservation suggests that the WD repeat domain performs a general role in addition to the phenomena observed in this study. Alternatively, the WD repeat domain might have an important role in some specific cell types but not in fibroblasts. Also, we cannot rule out the possibility that the T300A mutation has an impact only on the α-form, because we used β-form constructs in this study. Starvation-induced autophagosome formation, p62 degradation, and long-lived protein degradation were hardly affected by T300A or ΔWD mutants (Figs. 4 and 5), however, the LC3-II level was decreased in fed ΔWD mutant-reconstituted cells (Fig. 5A). This might be due to a slight reduction in the E3-like function by deletion of WD repeat domain or the WD repeat domain having a role in the fed condition. It is not clear how the T300A mutation affects Crohn disease besides canonical autophagy. Because the frequency of the Crohn disease-associated allele is relatively high, even in healthy controls (0.60 in affected individuals and 0.53 in controls) (7.Hampe J. Franke A. Rosenstiel P. Till A. Teuber M. Huse K. Albrecht M. Mayr G. De La Vega F.M. Briggs J. Günther S. Prescott N.J. Onnie C.M. Häsler R. Sipos B. Fölsch U.R. Lengauer T. Platzer M. Mathew C.G. Krawczak M. Schreiber S. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar), the T300A mutation may not have a significant effect on the role of the WD repeat domain. Another possibility is that the Atg16L1 complex is involved in a specialized pathway other than autophagy. Cadwell and colleagues reported that Atg16L1-hypomorphic mice did not exhibit significant deficiencies in managing Listeria monocytogenes infections, despite a remarkable defect in paneth cells (27.Cadwell K. Liu J.Y. Brown S.L. Miyoshi H. Loh J. Lennerz J.K. Kishi C. Kc W. Carrero J.A. Hunt S. Stone C.D. Brunt E.M. Xavier R.J. Sleckman B.P. Li E. Mizushima N. Stappenbeck T.S. Virgin 4th, H.W. Nature. 2008; 456: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Paneth cells exocytose granules containing antimicrobial products, such as α-defensins, lysozyme, and secretory phospholipase A2. The Atg16L1 complex might be involved in the granule exocytosis pathway, and the Crohn disease-associated mutation might impact this pathway. In this study we generated a rigid platform that is essential to further understand Crohn disease and the function of the Atg16L1 complex. It is highly possible that the T300A mutation causes subtle effects, and we hope this study helps shed further light on these differences. We thank Dr. Roger Y.

https://openalex.org/W1982188718,"Background Extensive spread of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) in the United States, and the concomitant increase in severe invasive staphylococcal infections, including osteomyelitis, in healthy children, has led to renewed interest in Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). However, the pathogenetic role of PVL in staphylococcal infections remains controversial, possibly because it depends on the site of infection. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the course of experimental rabbit osteomyelitis due to the PVL-positive CA-MRSA strain USA 300 (LAC) and its PVL-negative isogenic derivative (LACΔpvl), using a low and a high inoculum (8×105 and 4×108 CFU). With the low inoculum, bone infection was less frequent on day 7 (D7) and day 28 (D28) with LACΔpvl than with LAC (respectively 12/19 and 18/19 animals, p = 0.042). With the high inoculum of both strains, all the animals were infected on D7 and the infection persisted on D28 in almost every case. However, tibial bacterial counts and the serum CRP concentration fell significantly between D7 and D28 with LACΔpvl but not with LAC. Respectively 67% and 60% of LAC-infected rabbits had bone deformation and muscle/joint involvement on D7, compared to 0% and 7% of LACΔpvl-infected rabbits (p = 0.001 and p = 0.005 respectively). Between D0 and D28, the anti-PVL antibody titer increased significantly only with the high inoculum of LAC. Conclusions/Significance PVL appears to play a role in the persistence and rapid local extension of rabbit osteomyelitis, in keeping with the greater severity of human bone infections due to PVL-positive S. aureus. The possible therapeutic implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2011810082,"The default-mode network (DMN) is a functional network with increasing relevance for psychiatric research, characterized by increased activation at rest and decreased activation during task performance. The degree of DMN deactivation during a cognitively demanding task depends on its difficulty. However, the relation of hemodynamic responses in the resting phase after a preceding cognitive challenge remains relatively unexplored. We test the hypothesis that the degree of activation of the DMN following cognitive challenge is influenced by the cognitive load of a preceding working-memory task.Twenty-five healthy subjects were investigated with functional MRI at 3 Tesla while performing a working-memory task with embedded short resting phases. Data were decomposed into statistically independent spatio-temporal components using Tensor Independent Component Analysis (TICA). The DMN was selected using a template-matching procedure. The spatial map contained rest-related activations in the medial frontal cortex, ventral anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. The time course of the DMN revealed increased activation at rest after 1-back and 2-back blocks compared to the activation after a 0-back block.We present evidence that a cognitively challenging working-memory task is followed by greater activation of the DMN than a simple letter-matching task. This might be interpreted as a functional correlate of self-evaluation and reflection of the preceding task or as relocation of cerebral resources representing recovery from high cognitive demands. This finding is highly relevant for neuroimaging studies which include resting phases in cognitive tasks as stable baseline conditions. Further studies investigating the DMN should take possible interactions of tasks and subsequent resting phases into account."

The objectives of this study were to assess the role of the eIF2 kinases and protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum resident kinase (PERK) in controlling AADR to asparaginase and to compare the effects of asparaginase on mTORC1 to that of rapamycin. In experiment 1, asparaginase increased hepatic p-eIF2 in wild-type mice and mice with a liver-specific PERK deletion but not in GCN2 null mice nor in GCN2-PERK double null livers. In experiment 2, wild-type and GCN2 null mice were treated with asparaginase (3 IU per g of body weight), rapamycin (2 mg per kg of body weight), or both. In wild-type mice, asparaginase but not rapamycin increased p-eIF2, p-ERK1/2, p-Akt, and mRNA levels of asparagine synthetase and CHOP in liver. Asparaginase and rapamycin each inhibited mTORC1 signaling in liver and pancreas but maximally together. In GCN2 null livers, all responses to asparaginase were precluded except CHOP mRNA expression, which remained partially elevated. Interestingly, rapamycin blocked CHOP induction by asparaginase in both wild-type and GCN2 null livers. These results indicate that GCN2 is required for activation of AADR to asparaginase in liver.

The enzyme l-asparaginase has been used to treat both pediatric and adult forms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia for over 40 years (1.Hill J.M. Roberts J. Loeb E. Khan A. MacLellan A. Hill R.W. JAMA. 1967; 202: 882-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Asparaginase cleaves the nonessential amino acid asparagine into aspartic acid plus ammonia. The tumor-killing properties of asparaginase are ascribed to dependence on circulating asparagine for growth of the leukemic lymphoblast (2.Su N. Pan Y.X. Zhou M. Harvey R.C. Hunger S.P. Kilberg M.S. Pediatr. Blood Cancer. 2008; 50: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The form of asparaginase most commonly administered to patients is purified from Escherichia coli. Treatment with asparaginase is oftentimes accompanied by secondary complications, including hepatic dysfunction, neurologic seizures, pancreatitis, and immunosuppression (3.Holcenberg J. J. Pediatr.

Phosphorylation of eIF2 (p-eIF2) is catalyzed by a family of four protein kinases that are differentially sensitive to various cell stressors (7.Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). During amino acid deprivation, the eIF2 kinase called general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) is activated by intracellular accumulation of deacylated tRNA (8.Kimball S. Anthony T. Cavener D. Jefferson L. Topics in Current Genetics: Nutrient-induced Responses in Eukaryotic Cells.in: Winderickx P. Taylor J. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 113-130Google Scholar). The accumulation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates the eIF2 kinase called protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) (9.Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 10.Sood R. Porter A.C. Ma K. Quilliam L.A. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas viral infection stimulates protein kinase R, and heme deprivation triggers heme-controlled repressor. In addition to reducing global protein synthesis, p-eIF2 stimulates gene-specific translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which induces the expression of genes such as asparagine synthetase (ASNS) to relieve the particular cell stress. If the stress cannot be relieved, gene expression then switches to promoting cell death via transcription of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP, also known as GADD153) (11.Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol.

Simultaneous control of global and gene-specific translation directed by p-eIF2 is collectively referred to as the integrated stress response (ISR) (7.Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc.

In this study, we examined the role of GCN2 versus PERK in mediating activation of the ISR by asparaginase. To address this question, we generated mice with PERK disrupted in liver using a conditional gene deletion strategy. These mice were then crossed with GCN2 null mice to produce mice with both GCN2 and PERK deleted in liver that were subsequently characterized for changes in the ISR in response to asparaginase. eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 general control nonderepressible 2 protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum resident kinase 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 CAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein/growth arrest DNA damage-inducible gene 153 integrated stress response unfolded protein response activating transcription factor asparagine synthetase mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinases phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein kinase B regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1 analysis of variance integrated stress response phosphate-buffered saline mammalian target of rapamycin endoplasmic reticulum amino acid deprivation responses. Amino acid depletion is also sensed by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, which regulates mRNA translation via phosphorylation of translational repressor eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) (12.Shah O.J. Anthony J.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E715-E729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 facilitates cap-dependent mRNA translation, whereas phosphorylation of S6K1 plays important roles in ribosome biogenesis, control of cell size, and assembly of the translation preinitiation complex (13.Fingar D.C. Richardson C.J. Tee A.R. Cheatham L. Tsou C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 200-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Amino acid starvation inhibits phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 similar to treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, yet microarray analysis shows that these two conditions are distinct from each other (14.Peng T. Golub T.R. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5575-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 15.Deval C. Chaveroux C. Maurin A.C. Cherasse Y. Parry L. Carraro V. Milenkovic D. Ferrara M.

On the basis of these earlier observations, we wished to address whether the combination of rapamycin and asparaginase is a more potent mTORC1 inhibitor than either agent alone. The existence of cross-talk between the ISR and mTORC1 pathway in mammals is also important to consider as our laboratory reported that mTORC1 signaling is derepressed in GCN2 null mice fed a leucine-devoid diet (16.Anthony T.G. McDaniel B.J. Byerley R.L. McGrath B.C. Cavener D.R. McNurlan M.A. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36553-36561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, rapamycin is reported to block induction of CHOP by amino acid deprivation in mouse fibroblasts (17.Entingh A.J. Law B.K. Moses H.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), highlighting a role for the mTORC1 pathway in modulating a commonly used biomarker of the ISR. In this work, show that although both asparaginase and rapamycin down-regulate mTORC1 signaling, only asparaginase activates the ISR. Furthermore, nearly all amino acid deprivation responses (AADR) to asparaginase required GCN2, with the exception of CHOP, which asparaginase increased in a rapamycin-sensitive fashion. p-eIF2α antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Results were normalized for total eIF2α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibodies for phosphorylation of eIF4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1), and actin were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories. Antibodies against REDD1, p-Akt (Ser473), Akt, p-eEF2, eEF2, p-p44/42 MAPK (p-ERK1/2), and p-PDK1 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. ERK1/2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary antibody was purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Experimental animal diet used in this study was a standard commercial rodent food based on AIN-93 standards (18.Reeves P.G. Nielsen F.H. Fahey Jr., G.C. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar) consisting of 18% protein and 4% fat (7017 NIH-31 Open Formula Mouse/Rat Sterilizable diet, Harlan Teklad). The activity of experimental l-asparaginase derived from E. coli (Elspar® product from Merck) was determined by the Nesslerization technique, as described previously (4.Reinert R.B. Oberle L.M. Wek S.A. Bunpo P. Wang X.P. Mileva I. Goodwin L.O. Aldrich C.J. Durden D.L. McNurlan M.A. Wek R.C. Anthony T.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1976; 251: 6929-6933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the production of ammonia by l-asparaginase over time was expressed relative to the slope of known ammonia standards. The resulting value represented the activity of the enzyme in international units, in which 1 IU equaled the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of ammonia per min. Enzyme activity of l-asparaginase was determined prior to administration. The following study protocol was approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee at the Indiana University School of Medicine, Evansville. In these studies, mice were maintained on a 12-h light:dark cycle and given unrestricted access to food and water over the course of the experiment. In experiment 1, mice homozygous for the LoxP allele of PERK were mated with albumin-driven Cre recombinase transgenic mice (AlbCre+) (creation of mice with floxed PERK are described in Ref. 20.Bobrovnikova-Marjon E. Hatzivassiliou G. Grigoriadou C. Romero M. Cavener D.R. Thompson C.B. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16314-16319Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The AlbCre+ transgene-bearing offspring were bred to homozygocity for the LoxP allele of PERK to create a liver-specific deletion of PERK (AlbCre+PERKf/f) and produce Cre-negative wild-type littermates (AlbCre-PERKf/f). GCN2−/− mice (described below) were then bred to these lines, and progeny were brother-sister-mated to homozygocity so as to create a GCN2 null mouse possessing PERK knockdown in liver only. Male and female young adult mice (six mice per treatment group and equal sex distribution) were injected intraperitoneally once daily with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS containing an enzyme activity of 3 IU of Elspar® l-asparaginase per g of body weight, and tissues were collected 6 h after injection. In experiment 2, 6–8-week-old male and female C57BL/6J (GCN2+/+) mice and mice deleted for GCN2 (GCN2−/−; backcrossed onto C57BL/6J 10 generations) were randomly sorted (six animals per treatment group and equal sex distribution) into one of four treatment groups as follows: saline only, asparaginase only, rapamycin only, or rapamycin plus asparaginase. At the start of the experiment, mice were first administered by intraperitoneal injection either rapamycin at a dose of 2 mg per kg of body weight or an equal volume of PBS. Thirty minutes later, mice were then injected with either PBS or PBS containing an enzyme activity of 3 IU of Elspar® l-asparaginase per g of body weight. Body weight was measured prior to the first injection and at the end of study. All mice lost a slight amount of body weight between injection and tissue collection (∼5% or less), consistent with the study being conducted during the light cycle. Food intake was measured throughout the experiment and was similar between strains and among all treatment groups. Mice were killed 8 h after administration of l-asparaginase. Liver and pancreas were quickly dissected, rinsed in ice-cold PBS, weighed, and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples (ear punch or tail snippet, liver, pancreas, and spleen) were digested overnight with proteinase K, and total DNA was extracted using a commercial kit (DNeasy tissue kit, Qiagen). Mice were genotyped for GCN2 expression by PCR as described previously (21.Zhang P. McGrath B.C. Reinert J. Olsen D.S. Lei L. Gill S. Wek S.A. Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Cavener D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6681-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To examine expression of both Cre recombinase and floxed PERK, multiplex PCR was carried out using the following primer sets: Cre forward, 5′-CCTGGAAAATGCTTCTGTCCGTTT-3′, and Cre reverse, 5′-GAGTTGATAGCTGGCTGGTGGCAGATG-3′; flPERK forward, 5′-CACTCTGGCTTTCACTCCTCACAG-3′, and flPERK reverse, 5′-GTCTTACAAAAAGGAGGAAGGTGGAA-3′. Each primer (1 μl of 10 μm stock) was aliquoted into a PCR tube and combined with TaqPCR Master Mix (Qiagen), water, and 150 ng of template DNA. PCR cycle conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min and then 39 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 70 °C for 1 min, finishing with 70 °C for 10 min. Samples were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel, and bands were detected using a Kodak 4000MM Multimodal Imager with Carestream Health wide angle excitation (535) and emission (600) filters to visualize ethidium bromide. Tissues were homogenized, as described previously (4.Reinert R.B. Oberle L.M. Wek S.A. Bunpo P. Wang X.P. Mileva I. Goodwin L.O. Aldrich C.J. Durden D.L. McNurlan M.A. Wek R.C. Anthony T.G. J. Biol.

The homogenates were immediately centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C for analysis of protein expression and phosphorylation state as described below. Samples were size-fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P, Millipore, MA). Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Protein expression was analyzed using a Kodak 4000MM Multimodal Imager, and band density was quantitated using Kodak Molecular Imaging software (version 4.0.4). Phosphorylation of eIF2α was assessed using an antibody that recognizes the protein only when it is phosphorylated at Ser51. Results were normalized for total eIF2α. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 were measured as a decrease in mobility during SDS-PAGE, detected by immunoblot as described previously (22.Anthony T.G. Reiter A.K. Anthony J.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 281: E430-E439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). REDD1 protein expression was normalized to actin. Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 was normalized for total Akt. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was assessed using an antibody that recognizes ERK1/2 when phosphorylated at ERK1 (Thr202 and Tyr204) and/or ERK2 (Thr185 and Tyr187). Results were normalized for total ERK1/2. Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue using TriReagentTM (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) followed by DNase treatment (VersaGene DNase kit, Gentra Systems). To inactivate the reaction, the samples were heated to 70 °C for 5 min. The A260:280 ratio was between 1.8 and 2.0 following RNA clean up (RNeasy mini kit) (Qiagen). mRNA expression was determined by quantitative PCR using TaqMan reagents. 1 μg of RNA solutions was used for reverse transcription using high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TaqMan gene expression master mix and TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) were used for the PCR step. Amplification and detection were performed using the StepOnePlus real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with the following profile: 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles each at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. 10 ng of cDNA was used per reaction in a 10-μl reaction volume. All samples were run in triplicates. 18 S ribosomal RNA was chosen as a suitable normalization control gene. Results were obtained by the comparative Ct method, using ΔCt (the value obtained by subtracting the Ct value of ASNS or CHOP from the Ct value of 18 S ribosome mRNA of individual sample). Specifically, the quantity of target mRNA relative to 18 S ribosome mRNA was expressed as 2−(ΔΔCt). Results are expressed as fold change with respect to the experimental control. All data were analyzed by the STATISTICA statistical software (StatSoft, Inc.). Data were analyzed using one-way, two-way, or three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess main and interaction effects, with “Group” as the independent variable for one-way ANOVA (Fig. 1B); “Drug” and “Genotype” as the independent variables for two-way ANOVA (Fig. 1, C and D; supplemental Fig. S1, B and C); and “Rapamycin,” “Asparaginase,” and “Genotype” as the independent variables for three-way ANOVA (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, supplemental Fig. S1, A and D, and supplemental Fig. S2). When a significant main or interaction effect was detected, differences among treatment groups were assessed with Duncan's multiple range post hoc test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05 for all statistical tests. Previously, we showed that treatment with asparaginase activates p-eIF2 in liver and spleen but not pancreas (4.Reinert R.B. Oberle L.M. Wek S.A. Bunpo P. Wang X.P. Mileva I. Goodwin L.O. Aldrich C.J. Durden D.L. McNurlan M.A. Wek R.C. Anthony T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31222-31233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In that study, a slight increase in p-eIF2 was detectable in the liver of GCN2−/− mice 1–6 h after asparaginase injection. Considering a recent paper reporting that asparaginase temporarily induces protein aggregation in hepatocytes (23.Hernández-Espinosa D. Miñano A. Martínez C. Pérez-Ceballos E. Heras I. Fuster J.L. Vicente V. Corral J. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 142-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we further examined the contribution of PERK to p-eIF2 6 h after asparaginase treatment in liver. Mice with a liver-specific knockdown of PERK (produced by AlbCre-mediated deletion of floxed PERK (20.Bobrovnikova-Marjon E. Hatzivassiliou G. Grigoriadou C. Romero M. Cavener D.R. Thompson C.B. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16314-16319Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar); see Fig. 1A) showed robust hepatic p-eIF2 to asparaginase that was similar to AlbCre-negative control mice treated with asparaginase (Fig. 1B). GCN2 null mice were then bred to AlbCre-positive and -negative mice expressing floxed PERK to produce GCN2 null mice with PERK additionally knocked down in liver (Fig. 1A). Mice possessing GCN2-PERK double null livers demonstrated reduced p-eIF2 following asparaginase treatment as compared with saline-injected mice (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, induction of ASNS mRNA expression to asparaginase was similarly precluded in both GCN2 null livers and GCN2-PERK double null livers (compare values in Fig. 1D with SS control group in Fig. 2C). Thus, p-eIF2 and the ISR in response to asparaginase are mediated by GCN2 and not PERK. Previously, we demonstrated asparaginase to activate the ISR in liver, indicated by reduced hepatic protein synthesis alongside induction of p-eIF2, ASNS mRNA, and CHOP protein expression (4.Reinert R.B. Oberle L.M. Wek S.A. Bunpo P. Wang X.P. Mileva I. Goodwin L.O. Aldrich C.J. Durden D.L. McNurlan M.A. Wek R.C. Anthony T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31222-31233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study, asparaginase increased p-eIF2 and ASNS mRNA expression in the liver of GCN2+/+ but not GCN2−/− mice (Fig. 2, A and C). Hepatic CHOP mRNA levels were significantly increased in GCN2+/+ mice and slightly less so in GCN2−/− mice following asparaginase (Fig. 2D). Rapamycin prevented hepatic CHOP induction in both strains (Fig. 2D) but had no effect on hepatic p-eIF2 and ASNS mRNA expression. In the pancreas of both GCN2+/+ and GCN2−/− mice, neither asparaginase nor rapamycin altered p-eIF2 and mRNA expression of ASNS (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1). Asparaginase did not increase expression of ATF3 nor the molecular chaperone BiP/Grp78 and did not induce caspase-3 cleavage in the livers of GCN2+/+ and GCN2−/− mice (supplemental Fig. S1). In the liver and pancreas of GCN2+/+ mice, both rapamycin and asparaginase reduced phosphorylation of S6K1 (p-S6K1) (Fig. 3, A and B), with rapamycin being the more potent of the two agents. On the other hand, whereas rapamycin reduced p-S6K1 in both strains, asparaginase was effective in GCN2+/+ mice only. A similar pattern in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was seen with respect to asparaginase and rapamycin in GCN2+/+ and GCN2−/− mice, although the effects were much more modest (Fig. 3, C and D). To better understand why GCN2−/− mice demonstrate derepression of mTORC1 signaling following asparaginase treatment, we examined expression of the mTOR inhibitor, REDD1 (regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1). In response to a variety of cell stress conditions, REDD1 is transcriptionally up-regulated, reducing mTORC1 activity. On the other hand, loss of REDD1 protein by its rapid degradation and/or reduced expression leads to increased mTORC1 activity (24.Kimball S.R. Do A.N. Kutzler L. Cavener D.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3465-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, neither asparaginase nor rapamycin altered REDD1 protein expression in the livers of GCN2+/+ and GCN2−/− mice (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, no specific treatment or strain effects were observed in the phosphorylation of PDK1 (Ser241) or eEF-2 (Thr56) (supplemental Fig. S2). In certain cell lines, inactivation of S6K1 by rapamycin can activate the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) axis through stabilization of insulin receptor substrate 1, leading to an increase in p-Akt/PKB(Ser473) (25.Han E.K. Leverson J.D. McGonigal T. Shah O.J. Woods K.W. Hunter T. Giranda V.L. Luo Y. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5655-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the liver of GCN2+/+ mice, asparaginase increased p-Akt (Fig. 3E), but the effect of asparaginase alone was blocked in GCN2 null mice. Considering that phosphorylation of Akt is associated with protection of cells from apoptosis (26.Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar), the loss of p-Akt in the liver of GCN2 null mice treated with asparaginase suggests that these mice may be less capable of adapting to asparaginase upon continued asparaginase treatment. Rapamycin increased p-Akt(Ser473) in pancreas, but this effect depended on loss of GCN2 (Fig. 3, E and F). Amino acid starvation activates the ERK1/2 pathway to stimulate autophagy. A relationship between ERK1/2 signaling and GCN2 is suggested by a previous report showing that inhibition of MEK activation blocks p-eIF2 and ATF4 synthesis triggered by amino acid limitation in hepatocytes (27.Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Gjymishka A. Zhong C. Kaufman R.J. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10848-10857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this study, asparaginase increased p-ERK1/2 in liver and pancreas but only in GCN2+/+ mice (Fig. 4, A and B). Rapamycin did not significantly alter asparaginase-induced p-ERK1/2 in either tissue. This study produced several novel and clinically important findings. First, the data show that GCN2 and not PERK is required for activation of p-eIF2 by asparaginase in the liver of mice. Second, GCN2 is necessary not only for induction of hepatic p-eIF2 by asparaginase but also for a variety of AADR, such as down-regulation of mTORC1 and activation of p-Akt and p-ERK1/2. Third, GCN2 is not necessary for increased CHOP mRNA expression in liver by asparaginase, and finally, induction of CHOP by asparaginase is rapamycin-sensitive. These findings advance our understanding of the basic biological mechanism of asparaginase action in tissues in vivo and further reveal the critical role of GCN2 in managing the stress response to this chemotherapeutic agent. Previously, we reported that asparaginase does not induce phosphorylation of PERK between 15 min and 6 h after a single injection (4.Reinert R.B. Oberle L.M. Wek S.A. Bunpo P. Wang X.P. Mileva I.

https://openalex.org/W2065579329,"Background Simple and effective vaccine administration is particularly important for annually recommended influenza vaccination. We hypothesized that vaccine delivery to the skin using a patch containing vaccine-coated microneedles could be an attractive approach to improve influenza vaccination compliance and efficacy. Methodology/Principal Findings Solid microneedle arrays coated with inactivated influenza vaccine were prepared for simple vaccine delivery to the skin. However, the stability of the influenza vaccine, as measured by hemagglutination activity, was found to be significantly damaged during microneedle coating. The addition of trehalose to the microneedle coating formulation retained hemagglutination activity, indicating stabilization of the coated influenza vaccine. For both intramuscular and microneedle skin immunization, delivery of un-stabilized vaccine yielded weaker protective immune responses including viral neutralizing antibodies, protective efficacies, and recall immune responses to influenza virus. Immunization using un-stabilized vaccine also shifted the pattern of antibody isotypes compared to the stabilized vaccine. Importantly, a single microneedle-based vaccination using stabilized influenza vaccine was found to be superior to intramuscular immunization in controlling virus replication as well as in inducing rapid recall immune responses post challenge. Conclusions/Significance The functional integrity of hemagglutinin is associated with inducing improved protective immunity against influenza. Simple microneedle influenza vaccination in the skin produced superior protection compared to conventional intramuscular immunization. This approach is likely to be applicable to other vaccines too."
https://openalex.org/W2057775598,"PGRL1 RNA and protein levels are increased in iron-deficient Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. In an RNAi strain, which accumulates lower PGRL1 levels in both iron-replete and -starved conditions, the photosynthetic electron transfer rate is decreased, respiratory capacity in iron-sufficient conditions is increased, and the efficiency of cyclic electron transfer under iron-deprivation is diminished. Pgrl1-kd cells exhibit iron deficiency symptoms at higher iron concentrations than wild-type cells, although the cells are not more depleted in cellular iron relative to wild-type cells as measured by mass spectrometry. Thiol-trapping experiments indicate iron-dependent and redox-induced conformational changes in PGRL1 that may provide a link between iron metabolism and the partitioning of photosynthetic electron transfer between linear and cyclic flow. We propose, therefore, that PGRL1 in C. reinhardtii may possess a dual function in the chloroplast; that is, iron sensing and modulation of electron transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1971504423,"Background Given escalating rates of chronic disease, broad-reach and cost-effective interventions to increase physical activity and improve dietary intake are needed. The cost-effectiveness of a Telephone Counselling intervention to improve physical activity and diet, targeting adults with established chronic diseases in a low socio-economic area of a major Australian city was examined. Methodology/Principal Findings A cost-effectiveness modelling study using data collected between February 2005 and November 2007 from a cluster-randomised trial that compared Telephone Counselling with a “Usual Care” (brief intervention) alternative. Economic outcomes were assessed using a state-transition Markov model, which predicted the progress of participants through five health states relating to physical activity and dietary improvement, for ten years after recruitment. The costs and health benefits of Telephone Counselling, Usual Care and an existing practice (Real Control) group were compared. Telephone Counselling compared to Usual Care was not cost-effective ($78,489 per quality adjusted life year gained). However, the Usual Care group did not represent existing practice and is not a useful comparator for decision making. Comparing Telephone Counselling outcomes to existing practice (Real Control), the intervention was found to be cost-effective ($29,375 per quality adjusted life year gained). Usual Care (brief intervention) compared to existing practice (Real Control) was also cost-effective ($12,153 per quality adjusted life year gained). Conclusions/Significance This modelling study shows that a decision to adopt a Telephone Counselling program over existing practice (Real Control) is likely to be cost-effective. Choosing the ‘Usual Care’ brief intervention over existing practice (Real Control) shows a lower cost per quality adjusted life year, but the lack of supporting evidence for efficacy or sustainability is an important consideration for decision makers. The economics of behavioural approaches to improving health must be made explicit if decision makers are to be convinced that allocating resources toward such programs is worthwhile.

https://openalex.org/W2087604981,"Based on the relationship between working memory and error detection, we investigated the capacity of adult dyslexic readers' working memory to change as a result of training, and the impact of training on the error detection mechanism.27 dyslexics and 34 controls, all university students, participated in the study. ERP methodology and behavioral measures were employed prior to, immediately after, and 6 months after training. The CogniFit Personal Coach Program, which consists of 24 sessions of direct training of working memory skills, was used.Both groups of readers gained from the training program but the dyslexic readers gained significantly more. In the dyslexic group, digit span increased from 9.84+/-3.15 to 10.79+/-3.03. Working memory training significantly increased the number of words per minute read correctly by 14.73%. Adult brain activity changed as a result of training, evidenced by an increase in both working memory capacity and the amplitude of the Error-related Negativity (ERN) component (24.71%). When ERN amplitudes increased, the percentage of errors on the Sternberg tests decreased.We suggest that by expanding the working memory capacity, larger units of information are retained in the system, enabling more effective error detection. The crucial functioning of the central-executive as a sub-component of the working memory is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2042974448,"Misincorporation of amino acids in proteins expressed in Escherichia coli has been well documented but not in proteins expressed in mammalian cells under normal recombinant protein production conditions. Here we report for the first time that Ser can be incorporated at Asn positions in proteins expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. This misincorporation was discovered as a result of intact mass measurement, peptide mapping analysis, and tandem mass spectroscopy sequencing. Our analyses showed that the substitution was not related to specific protein molecules or DNA codons and was not site-specific. We believe that the incorporation of Ser at sites coded for Asn was due to mischarging of tRNA(Asn) rather than to codon misreading. The rationale for substitution of Asn by Ser and not by other amino acids is also discussed. Further investigation indicated that the substitution was due to the starvation for Asn in the cell culture medium and that the substitution could be limited by using the Asn-rich feed. These observations demonstrate that the quality of expressed proteins should be closely monitored when altering cell culture conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2076220323,"It has long been predicted that the members of the hyaluronidase enzyme family have important non-enzymatic functions. However, their nature remains a mystery. The metabolism of hyaluronan (HA), their major enzymatic substrate, is also enigmatic. To examine the function of Hyal2, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored hyaluronidase with intrinsically weak enzymatic activity, we have compared stably transfected rat fibroblastic BB16 cell lines with various levels of expression of Hyal2. These cell lines continue to express exclusively the standard form (CD44s) of the main HA receptor, CD44. Hyal2, CD44, and one of its main intracellular partners, ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM), were found to co-immunoprecipitate. Functionally, Hyal2 overexpression was linked to loss of the glycocalyx, the HA-rich pericellular coat. This effect could be mimicked by exposure of BB16 cells either to Streptomyces hyaluronidase, to HA synthesis inhibitors, or to HA oligosaccharides. This led to shedding of CD44, separation of CD44 from ERM, reduction in baseline level of ERM activation, and markedly decreased cell motility (50% reduction in a wound healing assay). The effects of Hyal2 on the pericellular coat and on CD44-ERM interactions were inhibited by treatment with the Na+/H+ exchanger-1 inhibitor ethyl-N-isopropylamiloride. We surmise that Hyal2, through direct interactions with CD44 and possibly some pericellular hyaluronidase activity requiring acidic foci, suppresses the formation or the stability of the glycocalyx, modulates ERM-related cytoskeletal interactions, and diminishes cell motility.

Although it is generally agreed that hyaluronidases play important roles in the degradation of HA, the specific functions of the six or seven members of the hyaluronidase family remain obscure (2.Kreil G.

A better understanding of all these divergent events necessitates more information regarding the action of Hyal2 at the cellular level.

Upon HA addition, the activity of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger NHE1 increases, the pH drops locally, and Hyal2 begins to degrade HA (17.Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Diedrich F. Stern R. Gilad E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26991-27007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Second, the membrane localization and enzymatic activity of Hyal2 have an absolute requirement for CD44 in transfected HEK293 cells. In that situation, the HA-degrading activity of Hyal2 is detected at pH 6.0–7.0 (10.Harada H. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5597-5607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Third, the pericellular HA-rich coat, or glycocalyx, that surrounds many types of cells disappears after exposure to either the HA-specific Streptomyces hyaluronidase or to HA oligosaccharides (20.Clarris B.J. Fraser J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1968; 49: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21.Knudson W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). This coat appears to be influenced by the level of Hyal2 expression. To test this hypothesis in a non-cancerous cell line, given that our only effective antibodies were specific for rat Hyal2, we selected BB16 cells, which are v-src-transformed rat fibroblasts (23.Veithen A. Cupers P. Baudhuin P. Courtoy P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells display a large pericellular glycocalyx coat and a high level of expression of CD44. In the current study, we have shown that high expression of Hyal2 is able to suppress anchoring of the pericellular coat of these cells almost entirely. This may occur through a destabilization of CD44, leading to a block in one of the main CD44 signaling systems, i.e. ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) activation. Loss of cell motility then ensues. Rat-1 cells transformed by the B77 subclone of Rous Sarcoma Virus (BB16) were kindly provided by Prof. Pierre Courtoy, Institute of Cellular Pathology, Brussels, Belgium (23.Veithen A. Cupers P. Baudhuin P. Courtoy P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 15 mm Hepes, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 66 μg/ml penicillin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Cambrex) under 5% CO2. The rat Hyal2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF034218, from 1997) was cloned in our laboratory, and polyclonal rabbit antibodies were generated. The P16 antibody used in the current study was raised against a 16-amino acid region in the body of rat Hyal2. The following commercial anti-CD44 antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal OX49 (BD Pharmingen) for immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, mouse monoclonal OX50 (BIOSOURCE) for CD44 blockade, and rabbit polyclonal HCAM (sc-7946, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for Western blotting. Goat polyclonal anti-lamin (sc-6214), mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (sc-5286), and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (sc-8334) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ERM and anti-pERM (phosphorylated ERM) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin, ethyl-N-isopropylamiloride (EIPA), wortmannin, LY294002, 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), Stains-All, Pronase, mitomycin C, and Streptomyces hyaluronidase were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG and peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-goat IgG were purchased from Dako. Alexa Fluor 488-tagged goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568-tagged goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Molecular Probes. 6- and 10-mer HA oligosaccharides were kindly donated by Seikagaku Corp. Three sources of high molecular mass HA were used: umbilical cord HA (∼2.5 × 106 Da, Sigma-Aldrich), Healon (∼1.6 × 106 Da, Amersham Biosciences), and preparations of smaller molecular mass HA (0.02–1.2 × 106 Da). The latter were a kind gift of Dr. Ove Wik, Amersham Biosciences. To obtain stable transfectants, BB16 cells were transfected with expression constructs containing cDNA inserts encoding rat Hyal2 or with the expression vector (pcDNA3.1+) alone, selected for Geneticin resistance, and isolated using cloning rings. Clones with a medium high expression level of Hyal2 (BB16Hy2+) were selected for most experiments of the present study. In some experiments, clones with intermediate levels of expression of Hyal2 were used. Clones transfected with the vector without Hyal2 insert (BB16mock) were used as controls. Transient transfections of BB16 cells with homemade EGFP-rat Hyal2 or commercial CD44 (RZPD, German Science Centre for Genome Research) were obtained using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For siRNA transfection, target sequences were selected and obtained from Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium). Three specific Hyal2 target sequences (Table 1) and one scrambled sequence (not shown) were used. Cells at 50–70% confluence in 6-well plates were transfected with 50 pmol of either the Hyal2 siRNA pool or the scrambled sequence, in 1.5 ml of complete medium, using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h, harvested, and processed for Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and migration assays.TABLE 1Sequences of the siRNA combination used in order to inhibit Hyal2 expressionsiRNASequenceHYAL2 #1 sense5′-CUG-CUA-CAA-UCA-UGA-UUA-UdTdT-3′HYAL2 #1 antisense5′-AUA-AUC-AUG-AUU-GUA-GCA-GdTdT-3′HYAL2 #2 sense5′-CUC-CCA-GUC-UAC-GUC-UUC-AdTdT-3′HYAL2 #2 antisense5′-UGA-AGA-CGU-AGA-CUG-GGA-GdTdT-3′HYAL2 #3 sense5′-GAU-GUG-UAU-CGC-CGG-UUA-UdTdT-3′HYAL2 #3 antisense5′-AUA-ACC-GGC-GAU-ACA-CAU-CdTdT-3′ Open table in a new tab Cells were cultured until 80% confluence, washed 3× with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and solubilized in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate) with Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science), tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (200 μm sodium molybdate, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate), and serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitors (1 μm microcystin-LR (Calbiochem) and 300 μm okadaic acid (Sigma)). In some cases, cell lysates were pretreated with endoglycosidase F (New England Biolabs). In other conditions, cells were pretreated with EIPA (20 μm) or with the HA-specific Streptomyces hyaluronidase (5 units/ml) for 16 h. Proteins (usually 5 μg) were analyzed using SDS-PAGE gel according to Laemmli (10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide) using a Mini Gel Protean set (Bio-Rad), followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) with incubation for 1 or 2 h at room temperature with specific antibodies. Blots were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dako), followed by an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To detect CD44 shedding, cells were serum-starved for 16 h and medium was collected, centrifuged to remove unattached cells, filter sterilized, and then concentrated. 25-μl samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described (24.Miranda M. Sorkina T. Grammatopoulos T.N. Zawada W.M. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30760-30770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) on cells seeded in 92-mm culture dishes using 2 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and NeutrAvidinTM (Pierce). To immunoprecipitate Hyal2, cells were labeled for 18 h with [35S]methionine, washed with ice-cold PBS and homogenized in the same buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at low speed, and the pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 0.25 m sucrose, 3 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture. Suspensions were homogenized with a Dounce tissue (tight) grinder and protein content was measured by Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Cells lysates (500 μg of proteins) were preincubated with protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science). Supernatants were incubated with P16 antibodies and then with protein A-agarose. Following incubation, immunoprecipitates were washed 5× with PBS containing 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate and boiled with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and Cyclone phosphorimager (Canberra Packard) analysis. For other immunoprecipitations, including CD44-Hyal2 co-immunoprecipitation, pellets were resuspended in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors. For CD44-ERM and CD44-pERM co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in a solution containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, as well as protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. In some cases, they were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After three washes in PBS, nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Subsequently, cells were incubated with one or two primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature in a wet chamber. Goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes) was added for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After each antibody incubation step cells were washed 5× with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and mounted in Mowiol. Series of optical sections were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and were projected to single images using LSM software. The particle exclusion assay was described previously (25.Goldberg R.L. Toole B.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 151: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In our experiments, 1.5 × 105 cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, 750 μl of a suspension of fixed and washed horse red blood cells (108 cells/ml) was added to the cells and allowed to settle for 15 min. The pericellular matrix was assessed from photographs by measuring the area delimited between the red blood cells and the cell membrane. A ratio of 1.0 indicates no matrix. To demonstrate the structural dependence of the pericellular matrix on HA and on CD44, cells were (a) treated with 5 units/ml HA-specific Streptomyces hyaluronidase for 1 h before adding OX50 antibodies and observing coat recovery; (b) incubated with 100 μm 4-MU, an inhibitor of HA synthesis, in serum-free medium for 16 h, or (c) treated with 6-mer or 10-mer HA oligosaccharides for 16 h. To assess the effect of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition, cells were preincubated with either 50 nm wortmannin or 5 μm LY294002 for 6 h before coat estimation. Cells were seeded in 92-well culture dishes. HA concentration was analyzed by a pseudo-RIA kit (Pharmacia HA Test) in the medium and in cell extracts following overnight digestion with 500 milliunits/ml Pronase at 55 °C in a 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2. The homogenate was boiled for 10 min before protein (Bio-Rad kit) and HA assay. Both cell extracts and media were tested for hyaluronidase activity at different pH levels using zymography, which was performed as recently published by our group (7.Jadin L. Wu X. Ding H. Frost G.I. Onclinx C. Triggs-Raine B. Flamion B. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 4316-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, 25-μg protein samples from cell extracts were incubated in vitro with 15 μg of 2.5 × 106 Da HA for 16 h at 37 °C in a reaction buffer containing 100 mm formate at pH 3.7. The samples were mixed with 1/6 volume of loading buffer (7× TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), 85% glycerol) and subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8% TAE-agarose gels at 50 V for 10 h. The size distribution of HA in samples was measured using a modification of the method described by Lee and Cowman (26.Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The gels were stained in 0.005% Stains-All in 50% ethanol overnight and photographed on a fluorescent light Transilluminator. Healon was iodinated with Na125I using IODO-BEADs (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and HA-binding activity was determined using a modified version of a method previously described (27.Underhill C.B. Chi-Rosso G. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8086-8091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were dissolved in 200 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled HA (0 to 8 μg/250 μl) in the absence or presence of non-labeled HA (100 μg/250 μl). After shaking for at least 20 min, 250 μl of saturated (NH4)2SO4 was added, followed by 25 μl of nonfat milk. The samples were centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 5 min. The tubes were rinsed twice with 50% saturated (NH4)2SO4, and the pellets were dissolved in water and processed for scintillation counting. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the background label measured in the presence of an excess of non-labeled HA. Purified HA (0.02–1.2 × 106 Da, Amersham Biosciences) was conjugated to fluorescein as described by de Belder and Wik (28.de Belder A.N. Wik K.O. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 44: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS with 0.1% NaN3 and a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein-HA (final concentration, 50 μg/ml). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Following washes with 0.1% NaN3 in PBS, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in the same solution for 30 min. Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Population-based movement of cells was measured by a wound healing assay as described previously (29.André F. Rigot V. Remacle-Bonnet M. Luis J. Pommier G. Marvaldi J. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 64-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this assay, cells are grown to confluency on plastic Petri dishes, then induced to re-populate a “wound” created by stripping a sharply defined channel using a sterile razor blade. To prevent growth during migration, cells were pre-treated with 4.5 μm mitomycin C for 2 h. These concentrations were optimized for the BB16 cell line as described (30.Platek A. Mettlen M. Camby I. Kiss R. Amyere M. Courtoy P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4849-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After band-stripping, cells were allowed to migrate into the wound for 6 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, supplemented or not with different hyaluronidases, 4-MU, or a PI3K inhibitor. Cells were then fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C and stained with Crystal Violet. The number of cells that had colonized the wound margin was assessed in random microscopic fields (magnification, 320×; 15 fields per assay). Results are presented as means ± S.E. One- and two-way analyses of variance were used. When statistically significant differences were found (p < 0.05), individual comparisons were made using Dunn or Bonferroni tests with GraphPad Prism Version 5 software. Experiments were performed on the rat fibroblastic v-src-transformed cell line BB16. Hyal2 protein was detected by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody, P16, raised against a peptide sequence of rat Hyal2. Because Hyal2 is poorly expressed in BB16 cells (Fig. 1A), stable transfectants were established using either rat Hyal2 cDNA or an empty vector. For comparison purposes, a clone with high expression of Hyal2 (BB16Hy2+) and a mock transfected clone (BB16mock) were selected. Several other clones overexpressing Hyal2 were also obtained; the relative amounts of Hyal2 mRNA in these clones based on quantitative reverse transcription-PCR ranged from 1.3 to 8.0 (supplemental Fig. S1B). None of the clones secreted Hyal2 into the medium (shown in Fig. 1A for BB16Hy2+ cells). The specificity of the P16 antibody was shown by preincubation with the immunogenic peptide (data not shown). Hyal2 overexpression in BB16Hy2+ cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation after metabolic labeling (Fig. 1B). BB16Hy2+ cells synthesized and secreted similar amounts of HA compared with BB16 cells (Table 2).TABLE 2Quantification of endogenous HABB16BB16Hy2+pCell-associated HA (ng/1000 cells)1.26 ± 0.191.66 ± 0.17NSHA in culture medium (ng/1000 cells)3.68 ± 1.053.51 ± 0.88NS Open table in a new tab Neither BB16 nor BB16Hy2+ cells showed any hyaluronidase activity in zymography at pHs ranging from 3.7 (Fig. 1C) to 6.8 (data not shown), whether in the medium or in cell extracts. The partial HA-degrading activity detected in BB16 cell extracts at pH 3.7 did not significantly increase in any Hyal2 overexpression clone (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, this type of activity could not be detected at any significant level in cell membrane fractions at pH 4.0 or 6.5 (supplemental Fig. S2), contrary to what has been observed by Harada and Takahashi in CD44- and Hyal2-overexpressing HEK293 cells (10.Harada H. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5597-5607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This almost complete lack of hyaluronidase activity of Hyal2 should be contrasted with the effects of transient transfections of rat Hyal1 cDNA in the same cells, which led to strong HA-degrading activity (Fig. 1, C and D). Prior studies have reported conflicting results regarding the subcellular localization of Hyal2, which has been assigned previously to lysosomes (9.Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22466-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 31.Chow G. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2006; 14: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), to the plasma membrane (13.Rai S.K. Duh F.M. Vigdorovich V. Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Lerman M.I. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4443-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and even to mitochondria (32.Chang N.S. BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as well as to nuclei (15.Hsu L.J. Schultz L. Hong Q. Van Moer K. Heath J. Li M.Y. Lai F.J. Lin S.R. Lee M.H. Lo C.P. Lin Y.S. Chen S.T. Chang N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16049-16059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the level of Hyal2 exposure on the outer cell surface of BB16 clones was evaluated by a cell surface biotinylation assay. A significant portion of Hyal2 was detected among biotin-labeled proteins in the streptavidin pellet of BB16Hy2+ cells, meaning Hyal2 was exposed at the outer plasma membrane during the process of biotinylation (Fig. 1E). However, for both Hyal2 and CD44, a well characterized HA receptor used as a control membrane protein, a good portion of the molecules remained inaccessible to external biotin (Fig. 1E). A standard red blood cell exclusion assay indicated that BB16 and BB16mock cells were capable of producing and organizing a HA-rich pericellular matrix with or without exposure to 10% fetal bovine serum (Fig. 2 and Table 3). In contrast, BB16Hy2+ cells were almost devoid of such a pericellular coat. The ratio of combined cell and pericellular matrix areas relative to the cell area was ∼2.0 in cells expressing low levels of Hyal2 (BB16 and BB16mock), but fell to ∼1.2 in BB16Hy2+ cells. In these cell lines and in six other clones expressing intermediate levels of Hyal2, there was a strong correlation between individual Hyal2 mRNA levels and the reduction in coat size (supplemental Fig. S1D).TABLE 3Effects of different treatments on pericellular HA coatsBB16BB16mockBB16Hy2+pBasal settingsUntreated cells2.05 ± 0.052.08 ± 0.041.22 ± 0.07<0.001Scrambled RNA2.28 ± 0.111.09"
https://openalex.org/W1982948953,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of multiple target genes. Deregulation of miRNAs is common in human tumorigenesis. The miRNAs, MIR-15a/16-1, at chromosome band 13q14 are down-regulated in the majority of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Methodology/Principal Findings We have measured the expression of MIR-15a/16-1, and 92 computationally-predicted MIR-15a/16-1 target genes in CLL patients and in normal controls. We identified 35 genes that are deregulated in CLL patients, 5 of which appear to be specific targets of the MIR-15a/16-1 cluster. These targets included 2 genes (BAZ2A and RNF41) that were significantly up-regulated (p<0.05) and 3 genes (RASSF5, MKK3 and LRIG1) that were significantly down-regulated (p<0.05) in CLL patients with down-regulated MIR-15a/16-1 expression. Significance The genes identified here as being subject to MIR-15a/16-1 regulation could represent direct or indirect targets of these miRNAs. Many of these are good biological candidates for involvement in tumorigenesis and as such, may be important in the aetiology of CLL."

The CCT-catalyzed transfer of a cytidylyl group from CTP to phosphocholine to form CDP-choline is regulated by a membrane lipid-dependent mechanism imparted by its C-terminal membrane binding domain. We present the first analysis of a crystal structure of a eukaryotic CCT. A deletion construct of rat CCTα spanning residues 1–236 (CCT236) lacks the regulatory domain and as a result displays constitutive activity.

Each chain is composed of a complete catalytic domain with an intimately associated N-terminal extension, which together with the catalytic domain contributes to the dimer interface. Although the CCT236 structure reveals elements involved in binding cytidine that are conserved with other members of the cytidylyltransferase superfamily, it also features nonconserved active site residues, His-168 and Tyr-173, that make key interactions with the β-phosphate of CDP-choline. Mutagenesis and kinetic analyses confirmed their role in phosphocholine binding and catalysis. These results demonstrate structural and mechanistic differences in a broadly conserved protein fold across the cytidylyltransferase family.

Domain M appears to act as an autoinhibitory device, whose interaction with phosphatidylcholine-deficient membranes releases an inhibitory constraint at the active site to enhance kcat by 2 orders of magnitude (9.Friesen J.A. Campbell H.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13384-13389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The primary evidence for this model is the constitutive activity of a construct lacking domain M, CCT236 (9.Friesen J.A. Campbell H.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13384-13389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism whereby membrane binding activates this important regulatory enzyme, we must first understand how the active form of the enzyme accomplishes catalysis. The cytidylyl transfer reaction catalyzed by CCT involves direct attack at the α-phosphate of CTP by a phosphoryl oxygen of phosphocholine acting as the nucleophile to displace the β,γ-phosphates (pyrophosphate) of CTP and form the product CDP-choline (Fig. 1B). Many aspects of this reaction mechanism resemble those of other adenylyl- and cytidylyltransferases, in which the transition state involves conversion of tetrahedral geometry at the α-phosphate to a planar bipyrimidal penta-coordinate geometry (10.Izard T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11.Leatherbarrow R.J. Fersht A.R. Winter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

One well characterized cytidylyltransferase with a solved structure is glycerol-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (GCT), which catalyzes the synthesis of CDP-glycerol, an intermediate in techoic acid synthesis for bacterial cell walls. Both GCT from Bacillus subtilis and CCTα from rat show random order (ternary) kinetics and have similar kcat and Km values (9.Friesen J.A. Campbell H.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13384-13389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13.Veitch D.P. Gilham D. Cornell R.B. Eur. J.

Crystal structures of GCT with bound CTP (PDB code 1COZ) (15.Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or with bound CDP-glycerol (PDB code 1N1D) (16.Pattridge K.A. Weber C.H. Friesen J.A. Sanker S.

The ligands are found in a pocket at the base of the β-sheet, in contact with the conserved HXGH and RTEGISTT motifs that are signatures of the GCT family of nucleotidyltransferases (15.Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This family includes ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferases (ECT), phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT), and the class I aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aa-tRS) (10.Izard T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15.Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L.

Proteins. 1995; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Multiple solved structures of PPAT and aa-tRS enzymes have been analyzed, and one as yet unanalyzed structure of human ECT was recently deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 3ELB). The sequence similarities between GCT, ECT, and CCT imply a highly conserved catalytic domain structure. However, the presence of additional domains in CCT, the fact that the catalytic domain of CCT is regulated whereas GCT and ECT are not, and the wide variability in specific folding elements between members of this family (17.Bork P. Holm L. Koonin E.V. Sander C. Proteins. 1995; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) gave reasons to suspect important structural differences between them. As a first step in unraveling the mechanism of autoregulation of CCT, we solved the structure of a soluble CCT fragment (CCT236) containing the N-terminal and catalytic domains (domains N and C) by x-ray crystallography at 2.2 Å resolution. This structure shows an active conformation of domain C in complex with its reaction product, CDP-choline. The C-terminal region of domain N is intimately associated with domain C and makes contacts across the dimer interface. Although the fold of domain C is closely related to that of GCT, the structure reveals two novel residues, His-168 and Tyr-173, at the active site that coordinate with the phosphocholine phosphate. These residues were not suspected to be involved in catalysis from the sequence alignment alone. Analyses of alanine substitutions at these sites confirmed their role in phosphocholine binding and efficient catalysis. An untagged version of residues 1–236 of rat CCTα (CCT236) was expressed in T.ni cells using baculovirus as described (8.Taneva S. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11768-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9.Friesen J.A. Campbell H.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13384-13389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After CM-Sepharose and Blue-Sepharose chromatography, the purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra-Spin filter, spun at 2800 × g. The protein was then subjected to gel filtration using a Sephacryl S-200 column (∼76-ml bead volume) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT. Fractions containing the purified CCT236 were pooled and concentrated to 12 mg/ml (0.45 mm) using an Amicon Ultra-Spin filter. CDP-choline was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. Approximately 2 mg of pure CCT236 was obtained per liter of cell culture suspension. The calculated molecular mass of this construct is 26,755 Da, and its sequence is the first 236 residues of UniProt accession number P19836. The cDNA encoding CCT236 was transferred from the baculovirus shuttle vector into pGEX6p1 via NcoI and BamHI cloning sites, to create a fusion protein with a PreScission protease-cleavable glutathione S-transferase tag. The pGEX6p1-CCT236 plasmid was transformed into the BL21-derived Rosetta cell strain (Novagen) for protein expression (18.Johnson J.E. Goulding R.E. Ding Z. Partovi A. Anthony K.V. Beaulieu N. Tazmini G. Cornell R.B. Kay R.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The overexpression protocol for selenomethionine-incorporated protein was based on the method of Doublié (19.Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Minimal media (1 liter) were inoculated with Rosetta cells from a 10-ml overnight culture and grown at 37 °C for 17 h. A mixture of amino acids was added to reach final concentrations of selenomethionine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine (each 60 mg/liter) and lysine, phenylalanine, and threonine (each 100 mg/liter). Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for ∼20 h at 28 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2800 × g for 15 min and stored at −80 °C. Thawed cells were resuspended in 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1 mg/ml DNase, and 1 mm DTT and were incubated for 1 h on ice. The lysed cells were cycled through a high pressure homogenizer (Avestin). The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The selenomethionine-substituted GST-CCT236 was purified by glutathione-agarose affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. The glutathione beads (0.8 ml) were equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT. The clarified lysate was bound to beads with gentle mixing for 3 h at 4 °C. The bound fusion protein was collected by centrifugation at 460 × g for 3 min. The beads were washed three times with the equilibration buffer. The beads were resuspended in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), and CCT236 was released from the matrix by incubation with the PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The cleaved CCT236 was applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated, and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT. The pure fractions were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-Spin Filter at 2800 × g, and a 10-fold molar excess of CDP-choline was added. The final protein concentration used for crystallization was 13 mg/ml (0.5 mm) with 5 mm CDP-choline. This purified CCT contains residues 1–236 of rat CCTα with an N-terminal linker (GPLGSA). The specific activities of untagged CCT236 versus CCT236 with the N-terminal linker were the same (2583 ± 377 units/mg for untagged CCT236 (n = 10) and 2783 ± 260 units/mg (n = 4) for CCT236 with the linker). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry gave a mass of 27,396 Da, consistent with selenomethionine incorporation into four of the five possible sites, on average. Purified CCTs were stored at −80 °C. The native CCT236 (0.45 mm CCT with 20 mm CDP-choline) was crystallized using the sitting drop vapor-diffusion method with a reservoir condition that contained 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and 1.4 m sodium formate. The protein sample (2 μl) was mixed with 1 μl of the reservoir solution and the drop was incubated over 1 ml of the reservoir. After 7 weeks, the drop was replenished with an additional 1 μl of the same protein sample to extend crystal growth for an additional 5 months. After transfer to a cryo-solution (0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 1.4 m sodium formate, 30% glycerol), the crystal was looped and cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen. A highly redundant diffraction dataset was collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) beamline 8.2.2 using an ADSC Q315 detector. 360 images were collected with a 1° oscillation angle and a 5-s exposure time. The initial 300 images were used for data processing and refinement (Table 1).TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics for the catalytic domain of Rat CCTαNativeSe-Met incorporatedCrystal parametersSpace groupP21212P2a, b, c89.0, 129.4, 43.6 Å129.2, 43.8, 88.3 Åα, β, γ90.0, 90.0, 90.0°90.0, 90.02, 90.0°Data collection statisticsWavelength1.00 Å0.9795 ÅResolution50.0-2.2 Å (2.28-2.20 Å)50.0-3.5 Å (3.63-3.50 Å)Total reflections294,97888,104Unique reflections26,31612,964RmergeaRmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl)− Ī(h̄k̄l̄)|/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl), where Ii(hkl) is the observed intensity, and Ī(h̄k̄l̄) is the average intensity obtained from multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections after rejections.0.105 (0.326)0.163 (0.269)Mean (I)/σI32.7 (6.6)14.1 (6.8)Completeness100.0% (100.0%)99.8% (99.8%)Redundancy11.2 (10.6)6.4 (6.8)Phasing statisticsNo. of sites17 (out of possible 20)Overall FOMbFOM is figure of merit; 〈|ΣP(α)eiα/ΣP(α)|〉, where α is the phase angle and P(α) is the phase probability distribution.0.24Overall FOM (after density modification)0.63Refinement statisticsProtein molecules in asymmetric units2Residues353Water molecules249Total no. of atoms3176RcrystcRcryst = Σ‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σ|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively./RfreedRfree is calculated using 5% of the reflections randomly excluded from refinement.0.22/0.27Average B-factor (all atoms)27.7 Å2Average B-factor (CDP-choline)19.1 Å2r.m.s.d. on angles2.08°r.m.s.d. on bonds0.03 Åa Rmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl)− Ī(h̄k̄l̄)|/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl), where Ii(hkl) is the observed intensity, and Ī(h̄k̄l̄) is the average intensity obtained from multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections after rejections.b FOM is figure of merit; 〈|ΣP(α)eiα/ΣP(α)|〉, where α is the phase angle and P(α) is the phase probability distribution.c Rcryst = Σ‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σ|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.d Rfree is calculated using 5% of the reflections randomly excluded from refinement. Open table in a new tab The selenomethionine incorporated CCT236 (0.5 mm CCT; 5 mm CDP-choline) was crystallized using the vapor-diffusion hanging drop method with a reservoir consisting of 20 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.6), 0.4 m lithium sulfate, 15% PEG8000. The protein sample (1 μl) was mixed with 1 μl of the reservoir condition and incubated over a 0.5-ml volume of the reservoir. The crystals appeared within 1 week. The cryo-protectant condition was 20 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.6), 20% PEG 8000, 0.4 m lithium sulfate, and 30% glycerol. The crystal was looped and cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior data collection. A complete SAD dataset was collected at the ALS beamline 8.2.1 using an ADSC Q315R detector as described above for the native crystal (Table 1). The diffraction data were processed with the program HKL2000 (20.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The programs HKL2MAP version 0.2 (21.Pape T. Schneider T.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 843-844Crossref Google Scholar) and AUTOSOL within PHENIX version 1.3 (22.Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

The program AUTOBUILD within PHENIX version 1.3 automatically performed density modification and partially constructed the polypeptide chain. The rest of the molecule was built and fitted using the program COOT (23.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar), and restrained refinements were carried out within the program REFMAC5 (24.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The P21212 native crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement using the partially refined selenomethionine P2 dimer with the program MOLREP (25.Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar). The model was manually adjusted and refined using Coot (23.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The P2 crystals have four protein chains in the asymmetric unit with a Matthews coefficient (Vm) and solvent content of 2.3 Å3 Da−1 and 47.3% respectively. The P21212 crystals have two protein chains in the asymmetric unit with a Vm and solvent content of 2.3 Å3 Da−1 and 46.4%, respectively. The secondary structure elements were analyzed with programs DSSP (26.Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar) and PROMTIF (27.Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The program CONTACT within the program suite CCP4 (28.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) was used to identify interacting residues and measure their distances. The Protein-Protein Interaction Server (29.Jones S.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) was used to identify and analyze pockets on the surface, and SURFACE RACER 1.2 (34.Tsodikov O.V. Record Jr., M.T. Sergeev Y.V. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the protein surface area with a probe radius of 1.4 Å. The DALI server (35.Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) was used to find proteins with a similar protein fold. The stereochemistry of the final model was analyzed with PROCHECK (36.Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using QuickChange mutagenesis (Stratagene), following company protocols. The template was the pGEX6p1-CCT236 plasmid described above. The primers used for the H168A mutation were 5′-gattgatttcgtcgccgctgacgatatcccctactc-3′ (sense) and 5′-ctaactaaagcagcggcpgactgctataggggatgag-3′ (antisense). The primers used for Y173A mutation were 5′-catgacgatatccccgcctcttcggcagggag-3′ (sense) and 5′-ctccctgccgaagaggcggggatatcgtcatg-3′ (antisense). Annealing temperatures of 78.5 and 80 °C were used during respective PCRs. The H168A,Y173A double mutant was created by introducing the Y173A mutation into the H168A template plasmid, using QuickChange and the same mutagenic primer detailed above. The GST-CCT mutant proteins were expressed in BL21 Rosetta cells (18.Johnson J.E. Goulding R.E. Ding Z. Partovi A. Anthony K.V. Beaulieu N. Tazmini G. Cornell R.B. Kay R.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), purified via glutathione affinity chromatography, and cleaved with PreScission protease, as described above. The protein concentrations in the pooled elution fractions were measured by the Bradford assay (37.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). CCT activity was measured by monitoring the conversion of 14C-labeled phosphocholine (Amersham Biosciences) into labeled CDP-choline (38.Davies S.M. Epand R.M. Kraayenhof R. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10522-10531Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The reaction volume was 40 μl, and each reaction contained 1 μg of CCT236, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 12 mm magnesium chloride, 89 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, and variable concentrations of the substrates, phosphocholine and CTP. The reactions were carried out for 10 min at 37 °C, with agitation, in the absence of added lipid vesicles. The phosphocholine dependence was monitored over a range of 0–5 mm with the CTP concentration held constant at 8.8 mm. The CTP dependence was monitored over a range of 0–27 mm with the phosphocholine concentration held constant at 1.5 mm. The kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. The initial velocity (nmol/mg/min) versus substrate concentration data were fit to the sigmoidal Hill equation, v = (Vmax [S]n)/(K*n + [S]n), where v = reaction rate; Vmax = maximum reaction rate; [S] = substrate concentration; K* = the Hill constant, i.e. the substrate concentration producing half-maximal velocity; and n = Hill coefficient. We observed substrate inhibition at high phosphocholine concentrations for CCT236 wild type and the Y173A mutant. Thus, the activity data used to calculate the K*(P-chol) for these constructs was limited to phosphocholine concentrations from 0 to 2 mm (wild type) and 0 to 1.4 mm (Y173A). CTP substrate inhibition was observed for all constructs at very high concentrations; thus the activity data used to calculate the K*[CTP] was limited to CTP concentrations of 0–20 mm (wild type), 0–5 mm (Y173A) and 0–18 mm, (H168A and H168A,Y173A). An untagged version of CCT236 yielded native crystals grown in a condition using sodium formate as a precipitant. These crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212 and diffracted to 2.2 Å (Table 1). No solution to this diffraction set emerged using molecular replacement methods with GCT structures as search models. Crystals of a selenomethionine-incorporated version of CCT236 could not be reproduced in the same condition but were generated in a lithium sulfate/PEG 8000 condition. With this crystal a complete SAD dataset scaled at 3.5 Å resolution yielded the experimental phases when scaled as monoclinic P2. The partially refined model of CCT236 in the space group P2 was used as a search model to obtain phases by molecular replacement methods for the higher resolution native P21212 dataset. The asymmetric units of both crystal forms consist of identical homodimers. In the orthorhombic unit cell, the asymmetric unit consists of a single dimer, whereas in the monoclinic unit cell, the asymmetric unit consists of two dimers. Both crystals display almost identical crystal packing arrangements. The refined structure at 2.2 Å resolution shows electron density for 353 residues of the possible 472 residues comprising the homodimer, with two bound CDP-choline molecules and 249 solvent molecules (Fig. 3A). Electron density is lacking for the N and C termini of both chains. Chain A accounts for residues 40–215 and chain B for residues 40–216. The crystal packing contacts allow sufficient space between adjacent stacked dimers to accommodate both N- and C-terminal regions as a disordered array. The visible portion of each monomer of the CCT236 dimer (Fig. 3A) contains the catalytic domain (C) plus 35 residues of the N-terminal region (N). Domain C (residues 75–215) conforms to the Rossmann fold, commonly found in nucleotide-binding proteins (39.Rao S.T. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Domain C is an α/β protein fold composed of five β-strands (β1–β5), and six α-helices (αA, αB, αC, αD, αL, and αE). This nomenclature strives to be compatible with the nomenclature of structurally analogous helices and strands in the previously solved structures of glycerol-phosphate CT (GCT) from B. subtilis (15.Weber C.H.

https://openalex.org/W2012482503,"Cellular uptake of several viruses and polybasic macromolecules requires the expression of cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) through as yet ill defined mechanisms. We unexpectedly found that among several cell-surface-binding single chain variable fragment (scFv) anti-HS antibody (alphaHS) clones, only one, AO4B08, efficiently translocated macromolecular cargo to intracellular vesicles through induction of HSPG endocytosis. Interestingly, AO4B08-induced PG internalization was strictly dependent on HS 2-O-sulfation and appeared independent of intact N-sulfation. AO4B08 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-Tat, i.e. a well known cell-penetrating peptide, were shown to compete for the internalizing PG population. To obtain a more detailed characterization of this pathway, we have developed a procedure for the isolation of endocytic vesicles by conjugating AO4B08 with superparamagnetic nanoparticles. [(35)S]sulfate-labeled HSPG was found to accumulate in isolated, AO4B08-containing vesicles, providing the first biochemical evidence for intact HSPG co-internalization with its ligand. Further analysis revealed the existence of both syndecan, i.e. a transmembrane HSPG, and glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-anchored glypican in purified vesicles. Importantly, internalized syndecan and glypican were found to co-localize in AO4B08-containing vesicles. Our data establish HSPGs as true internalizing receptors of macromolecular cargo and indicate that the sorting of cell-surface HSPG to endocytic vesicles is determined by a specific HS epitope that can be carried by both syndecan and glypican core protein."
https://openalex.org/W2068026833,"Fatalities resulting from paraquat (PQ) self-poisonings represent a major burden of this herbicide. Specific therapeutic approaches have been followed to interrupt its toxic pathway, namely decontamination measures to prevent PQ absorption and to increase its excretion from organism, as well as the administration of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs. Until now, none of the postmortem studies resulting from human PQ poisonings have assessed the relationship of these therapeutic measures with PQ toxicokinetics and related histopathological lesions, these being the aims of the present study.For that purpose, during 2008, we collected human fluids and tissues from five forensic autopsies following fatal PQ poisonings. PQ levels were measured by gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Structural inflammatory lesions were evaluated by histological and immunohistochemistry analysis. The samples of cardiac blood, urine, gastric and duodenal wall, liver, lung, kidney, heart and diaphragm, showed quantifiable levels of PQ even at 6 days post-intoxication. Structural analysis showed diffused necrotic areas, intense macrophage activation and leukocyte infiltration in all analyzed tissues. By immunohistochemistry it was possible to observe a strong nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) activation and excessive collagen deposition.Considering the observed PQ levels in all analyzed tissues and the expressive inflammatory reaction that ultimately leads to fibrosis, we conclude that the therapeutic protocol usually performed needs to be reviewed, in order to increase the efficacy of PQ elimination from the body as well as to diminish the inflammatory process."

Interaction of core with cellular membranes like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LD) appears to be involved in viral assembly. However, how these interactions with different cellular membranes are regulated is not well understood. In this study, we investigated how palmitoylation, a post-translational protein modification, can modulate the targeting of core to cellular membranes. We show that core is palmitoylated at cysteine 172, which is adjacent to the transmembrane domain at the C-terminal end of core. Site-specific mutagenesis of residue Cys172 showed that palmitoylation is not involved in the maturation process carried out by the signal peptide peptidase or in the targeting of core to LD. However, palmitoylation was shown to be important for core association with smooth ER membranes and ER closely surrounding LDs. Finally, we demonstrate that mutation of residue Cys172 in the J6/JFH1 virus genome clearly impairs virion production. Hepatitis C virus core protein is the viral nucleocapsid of hepatitis C virus.

Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar). HCV is an RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family and has a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome of 9.6 kb (2.Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1631-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The HCV RNA genome encodes a polyprotein of ∼3000 amino acids (aa) that is processed by host and viral proteases into 10 different components (3.Irshad M. Khushboo I. Singh S. Singh S. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 27: 497-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Core protein is the only virus-encoded nucleocapsid protein involved in assembly and packaging of the viral plus-strand RNA genome (3.Irshad M. Khushboo I. Singh S. Singh S. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 27: 497-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The C-terminal signal sequence (aa 173–191) facilitates channeling of the nascent HCV polyprotein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4.Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After cleavage, core protein (191 aa) is released and further processed by an intramembrane protease, the signal peptide peptidase (spp), to yield a protein of 177 aa (5.McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K.

The fully processed core protein interacts mainly with lipid droplets (LD) and ER membranes and was also reported to be translocated into the nucleus (7.Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen.

Recent studies have indicated that assembly of HCV particles occurs on ER membranes that are associated closely with LD (11.Miyanari Y. Atsuzawa K. Usuda N. Watashi K. Hishiki T. Zayas M.

To facilitate HCV assembly, core protein also promotes LD accumulation when expressed in cells (12.Abid K. Pazienza V. de Gottardi A. Rubbia-Brandt L. Conne B. Pugnale P. Rossi C. Mangia A. Negro F.

Because HCV core is targeted to different organelle membranes during the viral life cycle, we investigated whether post-translational modification of core in the form of palmitoylation could be involved in this trafficking. Palmitoylation or S-acylation is the covalent attachment of a fatty acid group, usually the saturated 16 carbon palmitate to cysteine residues via a thioester bond (17.Tsutsumi R. Fukata Y. Fukata M. Pflügers Arch. 2008; 456: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Protein palmitoylation enhances surface hydrophobicity and membrane affinity and plays an important role in modulating protein trafficking (18.Charollais J. Van Der Goot F.G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2009; 26: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a site for palmitoylation in HCV core protein. The cysteine modified by a palmitate moiety is adjacent to the ER-targeting domain located at the C terminus. We demonstrate that spp processing and LD targeting was unaffected by impairment of this palmitoylation generated by mutation. However, mutated HCV core protein accumulated differently in the ER membrane and was poorly associated with ER surrounding LD. It is of high importance that we observed that a mutation in the palmitoylation site of HCV core impaired viral infectivity. Clones of Pichia pastoris expressing HCV core C (aa 1–191) of strain H77 (genotype 1a) and spp, a signal peptide peptidase of human cell origin, have been described previously (19.Majeau N. Gagné V. Boivin A. Bolduc M. Majeau J.A. Ouellet D. Leclerc D. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced by PCR and conventional cloning methods. Cys172 and Cys91 were replaced by Ser and Leu, respectively. Yeast cells were transformed, and protein expression was induced with methanol as described previously (20.Majeau N. Gagné V. Bolduc M. Leclerc D. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 3055-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The coding sequences of the HCV core were inserted into the polylinker site of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) with BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites (New England BioLabs). Vaccinia virus expressing HCV core-E1 protein (Sc59 6C/Ss) was kindly provided by Chiron (Emeryville, CA). Vaccinia Ankara strain expressing T7 polymerase was generously provided by Bernard Moss (NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The plasmid FL-J6/JFH-5′C19Rluc2AUbi, which consists of the full-length HCV genome and expresses Renilla luciferase, was kindly provided by Charles M. Rice (The Rockefeller University, New York, NY). The substitution of Cys for Ser in J6 core protein was introduced by PCR and cloned into the J6/JFH1 clone as a BglII/BsiWI fragment. All of the plasmid HCV sequences were verified by sequencing. Palmitoylation of core was examined by a recently developed biotin switch assay technique (21.Wan J. Roth A.F. Bailey A.O. Davis N.G. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In this protocol, acylation groups attached to cysteine residues via thioester bonds are replaced with biotin moieties. Yeast cell cultures (200 ml) expressing spp or co-expressing spp and core proteins were induced as previously described (20.Majeau N. Gagné V. Bolduc M. Leclerc D. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 3055-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The cells were collected and ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. For analysis of human hepatoma cells, Huh7.5 cells were infected with vaccinia virus (C-E1). After 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested using a rubber policeman. The cells were recovered by centrifugation and frozen at −80 °C. The samples were resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Pierce) and 1.7% Triton X-100. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 500 × g to remove insoluble material. The proteins were precipitated with methanol/chloroform, and the air-dried pellet was resuspended in 3.6 ml of SDS buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The proteins were precipitated three times with methanol/chloroform and resuspended in 1.5 ml of SDS buffer to be further divided into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was combined with 2.9 ml of 0.7 m fresh hydroxylamine, 1× complete protease inhibitors, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mm biotin-N-(6-(biotinamido)hexyl)-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)-propionamide (HPDP) (Thermo Scientific). As a control, the remaining aliquot was treated using the same procedure, but hydroxylamine was replaced with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Both samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The proteins were precipitated using methanol and chloroform and resuspended in 1.2 ml of biotin buffer (0.4% SDS, 120 mm NaCl, 0.16% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.16 mm biotin-HPDP 1× inhibitor mixture, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were precipitated three times using the same procedure and resuspended in 2.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min, and aliquots were removed as controls. The remaining reactions were incubated with 15 μl of neutravidin-agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) at room temperature for 90 min. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS, and the proteins were eluted by adding 1% β-mercaptoethanol to the washing buffer and incubating for 15 min at 37 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min, and aliquots were removed as controls (22.Majeau N. Bolduc M. Duvignaud J.B. Fromentin R. Leclerc D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 78-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid as previously described (23.Hirschman J.E. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7705-7711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P. pastoris was cultured overnight in 200 ml of minimal glucose medium (Invitrogen) at 30 °C to an optical density of 2 and, after a short centrifugation, transferred to 20 ml of minimal glucose medium + 0.1% methanol (Invitrogen) for 6 h in the presence of the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor cerulenin (2 mg/ml). In some cell cultures, 50 μm 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) or Me2SO were also added. The cell cultures were then incubated for 2 h with 1 mCi of [9,10-3H(N)]palmitic acid (Amersham Biosciences) (50 Ci/mmol). The cells were disrupted with sarkosyl (0.5%), and the proteins were denatured with 1% SDS. The protein samples were resolved on nonreducing 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter and exposed to a [3H] intensifying screen for 7 days. The signals were revealed using phosphorimaging. The blot was then analyzed further by Western blotting using anti-core antibodies 537 (19.Majeau N. Gagné V. Boivin A. Bolduc M. Majeau J.A. Ouellet D. Leclerc D. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Huh7.5 cells labeling with [3H]palmitic acid was performed as previously described (24.Yu G.Y. Lee K.J. Gao L. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6013-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The cells were infected with vaccinia virus and vaccinia virus expressing HCV core protein and incubated overnight in medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, 5 mm sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 37 μCi/ml of [9,10-3H(N)]palmitic acid (PerkinElmer). The cells were washed with PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1× complete protease inhibitors). The cell lysate was resolved in a nonreducing SDS-PAGE and analyzed with phosphorimaging. The flotation assay was carried out as previously described (25.Lingwood D. Simons K. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Two hours after infection of Huh7.5 cells with vaccinia virus carrying the T7 polymerase gene, the cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 constructs using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). In some cases, 50 μm of 2-BP was added to the medium. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then harvested using a rubber policeman. The collected cells were suspended in 0.6 ml of TNEi buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1× complete protease inhibitors, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4), homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer and then resuspended using a 25-gauge needle. The samples were split into two equal portions, and each was incubated for 30 min on ice with or without 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were mixed with 0.6 ml of Optiprep (Sigma) to a final concentration of 40% iodixanol. This mixture was overlaid with 2.9 ml of 30% iodixanol and 400 μl of TNEi and then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm, 4 °C for 4 h in a SW60ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The fractions (0.4 ml) were collected from the top of the centrifuging tube and then precipitated with 4 volumes of cold acetone. The pellets were resuspended in loading buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The proteins were revealed with anti-core, anti-caveolin-1 (Sigma), and anti-calnexin (Sigma) antibodies. Huh7.5 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and grown on glass coverslips. Two days after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature followed by 15 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Primary antibodies (anti-core 537) were diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with cells for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) were added to cells at a 1:200 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. To stain lipids, the slides were rinsed in 60% isopropanol, incubated in 5 mg/ml oil red O (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), in 60% isopropanol for 2 min at room temperature, and rinsed in 60% isopropanol again. After staining, the slides were washed in PBS and mounted in ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Microscopy was performed using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 510, and the images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse TE 300. Image analysis of LD content was performed using Cell profiler software (26.Carpenter A.E. Jones T.R. Lamprecht M.R. Clarke C. Kang I.H. Friman O. Guertin D.A. Chang J.H. Lindquist R.A. Moffat J. Golland P. Sabatini D.M. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R100Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar) on 35 micrographs for each sample. The area occupied by LD was evaluated for each positive cell. For extraction of ER membranes, Huh7.5 cells infected with vaccinia T7 polymerase and transfected for 24 h with pCDNA3.1 expressing core or core mutant C172S were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped into homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1× complete protease inhibitors, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4) to be disrupted by Dounce homogenization and repeated passages through a fine syringe needle. The extract was spun down at 1,500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h in a 70.1ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The resulting pellet, representing the membrane fraction, was resuspended in homogenization buffer and layered (0.5 ml) on top of an iodixanol step gradient composed of 0.5 ml of 10%, 0.5 ml of 15%, 1 ml of 20%, 0.5 ml of 25%, and 1 ml of 30% iodixanol and centrifuged at 200,000 × g at 4 °C for 2.5 h in a SW60Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from top to bottom, and the fraction proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-core 537 and anti-calnexin (Sigma) antibodies. Yeast cells were fixed as described in Ref. 27.Schmidt M. Bowers B. Varma A. Roh D.H. Cabib E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 293-302PubMed Google Scholar with 3% paraformaldehyde containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at room temperature for 2 h and then washed well with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Fixed cells were treated with 1% metaperiodate for 30 min followed by 30 min of incubation with 50 mm NH4Cl/PO4, pH 7.2. After washing, the cells were embedded in LR white. Ultrathin sections were incubated with anti-core 537 (1:2000) and then with gold-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). The ultrathin sections were stained with uranylacetate and lead citrate and analyzed with a JEOL 1010 80-kV transmission electron microscope. Image analysis of the LD content was performed with cell profiler software (26.Carpenter A.E. Jones T.R. Lamprecht M.R. Clarke C. Kang I.H. Friman O. Guertin D.A. Chang J.H. Lindquist R.A. Moffat J.

Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R100Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar) on 20 micrographs taken at low magnification (10,000× and 12,000×), which included over 300 cells for each clone. The area occupied by LD on the micrograph was normalized to the area occupied by all the cells on the same micrograph. The plasmid FL-J6/JFH-5′C19Rluc2AUbi wt and mutated (C172S) were linearized with XbaI and treated with mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs) to yield the exact HCV 3′ end (28.Tscherne D.M.

In vitro transcription was performed with a T7 RiboMAX express large scale RNA production system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Subconfluent Huh7.5 cells were trypsinized, washed twice with ice-cold OptiMEM (Invitrogen), and resuspended in OptiMEM at 10 × 106/ml. Four hundred microliter of cells were mixed with 10 μg of in vitro transcribed RNA or not (mock) in a cuvette with a gap width of 0.4 cm (Bio-Rad) and immediately pulsed at 960 farads and 270 V using a Gene Pulser system (Bio-Rad). Electroporated cells were transferred in 4 ml of complete medium, and 300 μl were cultured for 4 or 72 h in a 24-well plate prior to be lysed in Renilla lysis buffer (Promega). For infection, 5 × 104 naïve Huh7.5 cells, cultured in 24-well plate, were inoculated overnight by 250 μl of filtered supernatant harvested 3 days post-electroporation. After being washed twice in PBS, infected cells were left in culture for 48 h additional and lysed in Renilla lysis buffer. Luciferase activity was measured for 10 s, using a luminometer. Viral RNA was isolated from 50 μl of supernatants harvested 3 days post-electroporation using the MagMAX-96 viral RNA isolation kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin, TX). 7.5 μl of sample were used for quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis employing an Applied Biosystems 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplifications were conducted in duplicate with the TaqMan RNA-to-Ct 1 step as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems) using 0.5 μm of primers amplified a conserved segment of the 5′-untranslated region of HCV genotype 2a (reverse, 5′-GAGTGGGTTTATCCAAGAAAG-3′, and forward, 5′-TCTGCGGAACCGGTGAGT-3′) and 0.2 μm of the TaqMan probe HCV 2a (5′-FAM-CCGGAATTGCCGGGAAGACTG-BHQ-1-3′) (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, CA). The amounts of HCV RNA were calculated by comparison with serially diluted in vitro transcripts purified as described above. This assay was linear between 107 and 101 RNA copies/microliter. For the data depicted in Figs. 9 and 11, statistical significance between groups was determined by analysis of variance. Calculations were made with Prism version 3.03 software. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The statistical significance of the results was defined by performing a one-way analysis of variance combined with Turkey's post tests to compare all pairs of columns.FIGURE 11Effect of Cys172 mutations on HCV infectivity. A, Huh7.5 cells were transfected in parallel with RNA transcripts from J6/JFH1 and J6/JFH1-C172S. Replication was assayed by luciferase activity at 72 h post-electroporation. B, infectious virus production at 72 h post-electroporation was also assayed by luciferase activity 3 days post-infection.

A subsequent maturation event of core meditated by spp cleaves this hydrophobic domain to produce the mature core, which is predicted by algorithm for amphiphilicity index (29.Mitaku S. Hirokawa T. Tsuji T. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) to be a soluble protein. However, most of the processed core remains tightly associated to intracellular membranes (30.Ogino T. Fukuda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kohara M. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11766-11777Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This association depends on the integrity of an amphipathic α-helix spanning aa 116–134 (8.Suzuki R. Sakamoto S. Tsutsumi T.

In this study, we investigated whether the affinity of core to membranes was enhanced by post-translational modification such as S-acylation. Although there is no unique canonical motif for acylation sites, the computer algorithm CSS-Palm 2.0 predicts potential palmitoylation sites by clustering and scoring known palmitoylated proteins (31.Ren J. Wen L. Gao X. Jin C. Xue Y. Yao X. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This algorithm was applied to the sequence of the mature HCV core protein genotype 1, which contains three cysteine residues (i.e. Cys91, Cys128, and Cys172). The program highlights a possible palmitoylation site at Cys172 using a threshold for prediction corresponding to 89% accuracy and 94% specificity (Table 1). The palmitoylation site is predicted only for the 177-aa core that has been processed by spp. Palmitoylation of Cys172 is not predicted in the context of the HCV polyprotein, when core protein is still fused to E1, or in its immature form comprising 191 aa that is generated upon signal peptidase cleavage.TABLE 1Palmitoylation site prediction in HCV core proteinPositionPeptideScore 1Score 291NEGCGWA0.1390.139128TLTCGFA0.0520.052172LPGCSFS0.4171.122aOnly Cys172 in the processed form of core has a score indicating a high likelihood of palmitoylation.a Only Cys172 in the processed form of core has a score indicating a high likelihood of palmitoylation. Open table in a new tab To determine whether HCV core protein is indeed modified by the addition of a lipid moiety (e.g. palmitoylation), we measured its endogenous acylation state using the biotin switch assay. This method relies on the exchange of thioester-linked protein acyl modifications for biotin moieties (21.Wan J. Roth A.F. Bailey A.O. Davis N.G. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). HCV core (191 aa) was co-expressed with human spp and extracted from P. pastoris as described previously (20.Majeau N. Gagné V. Bolduc M. Leclerc D. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 3055-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As a first step, free sulfhydryl groups of proteins were blocked by incubation with N-ethylmaleimide. Then fatty acid groups were specifically removed using hydroxylamine to generate a free cysteine residue at the palmitoylation site. The newly exposed sulfhydryl groups were labeled with thiol-reactive biotin. The proteins were then precipitated with neutravidin and analyzed by Western blotting. Incomplete blockage of the cysteine residue prior to acyl group exchange could lead to false positive results. To exclude this possibility, hydroxylamine was omitted and replaced by Tris in half the samples. These control samples should give negative signals if the protein has been adequately blocked by N-ethylmaleimide. As shown in Fig. 1A, biotinylated core protein was present in the hydroxylamine-treated sample and absent from the nonhydroxylamine-treated sample. Prior to extraction, yeast cell samples were also incubated for 24 h with the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP. As shown in Fig. 1A, for the same amount of initial core protein, 2-BP reduced the amount of biotinylated protein recovered in the neutravidin-purified samples in a dose-dependent manner. To verify whether this modification occurs also in human cells, the biotin switch assay was performed on protein extracts of hepatocytes expressing HCV core (Fig. 1B). Huh7.5 cells were infected with vaccinia virus expressing HCV protein from 1 to 382 aa (C-E1). In this construct, the core protein is cleaved first with signal peptidase followed by spp maturation. Biotinylated core protein was present in the protein sample treated with hydroxylamine and extracted with neutravidin. These results indicate that HCV core protein is also an acylated protein in Huh7.5 cells. To confirm the observations made with the biotin switch experiments, we performed a metabolic labeling assay with radioactive palmitate. P. pastoris expressing spp alone or co-expressing core and spp were grown in minimal medium supplemented with [3H]palmitate for 2 h. As well, Huh7.5 cells expressing core protein were also incubated with [3H]palmitate for 24 h. The proteins were extracted and resolved on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. A radioactive band of 21 kDa was present in cells expressing core but absent in mock transfected cells or cells incubated with 2-BP and that for yeast extracts (Fig. 2A) or the hepatocytes samples (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis of these samples revealed that these protein bands corresponded to core protein (data not shown). These results confirmed that HCV core is indeed a palmitoylated protein. Cyst"

The mismatch-, MutS-, and MutL-dependent activation of MutH is unaffected by the presence or orientation of loaded β clamp on either 3′ or 5′ heteroduplexes. Similarly, β is not required for 3′ or 5′ mismatch-provoked excision when scored in the presence of γ complex or in the presence of γ complex and DNA polymerase III core components. However, mismatch repair does not occur in the absence of β, an effect we attribute to a requirement for the clamp in the repair DNA synthesis step of the reaction. We have confirmed previous findings that β clamp interacts specifically with MutS and MutL (López de Saro, F. J., Marinus, M. G., Modrich, P., and O'Donnell, M. (2006) J. Biol.

In addition, we have found that the DNA polymerase III α catalytic subunit interacts strongly and specifically with both MutS and MutL. Because interactions of polymerase III holoenzyme components with MutS and MutL appear to be of limited import during the initiation and excision steps of mismatch correction, we suggest that their significance might lie in the control of replication fork events in response to the sensing of DNA lesions by the repair system.

IntroductionMismatch repair is a conserved genetic stabilization system that in bacteria corrects DNA replication errors and ensures the fidelity of genetic recombination (1.Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A.

In Escherichia coli, the strand specificity necessary for removal of DNA biosynthetic errors from the daughter strand is based on the transient absence of d(GATC) methylation in newly synthesized DNA (4.Pukkila P.J. Peterson J. Herman G. Modrich P. Meselson M. Genetics. 1983; 104: 571-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A methyl-directed reaction that can account for replication error correction has been reconstituted using purified E. coli activities (5.Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P.

Assembly of a MutS-MutL-heteroduplex complex activates MutH endonuclease, which incises the unmethylated strand at a hemimethylated d(GATC) site (9.Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting strand break, which may reside 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch, serves as the entry site for an excision system comprised of DNA helicase II and an appropriate single-strand exonuclease. Excision directed by a 3′ strand break depends on the 3′ to 5′ hydrolytic activity of exonuclease I, exonuclease VII, or exonuclease X, whereas the 5′ to 3′ activity of either RecJ exonuclease or exonuclease VII is sufficient to support hydrolysis directed by a 5′ strand break (6.Cooper D.L.

The ensuing gap is repaired by DNA synthesis, in a reaction that depends on the integrity of dnaX (formerly called dnaZ) (5.Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P.

Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar).Direct interactions of the β clamp with MutS and MutL have been demonstrated (11.López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that this component of the replication apparatus could be involved in early steps of mismatch repair. Two MutS motifs have been implicated in this interaction, one located near the N terminus and the second near the C terminus. Deletion of the C-terminal motif (812QMSLL816) abolishes in vitro MutS interaction with β in the absence of DNA but does not confer hypermutability in vivo (12.López de Saro F.J. Marinus M.G. Modrich P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14340-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By contrast, Ala substitution mutagenesis within the N-terminal MutS motif (15QQYLRL20) is without effect in MutS-β interaction in solution but confers strong hypermutability in the E. coli cell. The latter finding has led to the proposal that the N-terminal β interaction motif of MutS might play an important role in the interaction of the two proteins, but only when they are DNA-bound.To clarify the role(s) of the β clamp in mismatch repair, we have evaluated the effects of the E. coli β, γ complex, and Pol III core on individual steps of the reconstituted E. coli methyl-directed reaction. Our results indicate that β is dispensable for MutH activation and excision steps of the reaction but essential for overall repair.DISCUSSIONSliding clamp involvement in mismatch repair has been the subject of extensive analysis. Popular models for clamp function in mismatch repair have invoked clamp-based recruitment of a MutS protein to sites of replication (11.López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nevertheless, inactivation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen interaction motif of yeast MutSα results in only a modest mutability increase (39.Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 43.Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and deletion of this motif from human MutSα is without significant effect on the initiation or excision steps of in vitro mismatch correction, although it does confer a partial defect in 5′-directed repair when the complete reaction is scored (44.Iyer R.R. Pohlhaus T.J. Chen S. Hura G.L. Dzantiev L. Beese L.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13310-13319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).As judged by in vitro assay using covalently closed or nicked circular model heteroduplexes, we have found that the β sliding clamp has little if any effect on the initiation or excision steps of methyl-directed mismatch repair. However, because β is required for overall repair as scored using the same DNAs, we infer that the clamp plays an essential role during the repair DNA synthesis stage of mismatch correction. It is noteworthy that our findings do not exclude a role for β in providing a link between the excision and repair synthesis steps of mismatch correction, particularly in the case of 5′ heteroduplex repair where excision and repair synthesis could occur in a concerted manner.As discussed above, two potential β interaction motifs have been identified within E. coli MutS (11.López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12.López de Saro F.J. Marinus M.G. Modrich P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14340-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A C-terminal MutS element is a bona fide β interaction motif, conferring strong interaction with the clamp in vitro. Deletion of this motif (MutSC) abolishes in vitro interaction of the two proteins but does not result in elevated mutability in vivo (12.López de Saro F.J. Marinus M.G. Modrich P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14340-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although synthetic peptides containing the N-terminal motif interact with β, Ala substitution mutagenesis of this motif (MutSN) does not alter in vitro interaction of β with native MutS in the absence of DNA. However, the finding that the mutSN mutation results in hypermutability has led to the proposal that this sequence element may support β interaction, but only when the two proteins are DNA-bound. Our results suggest that this is not the case and that the biological phenotype associated with the mutSN mutation is the probable result of instability coupled with a general activity defect. It therefore seems likely that the MutS-β interaction is largely mediated via the C-terminal MutS motif and that this interaction is of limited significance during the early steps of methyl-directed mismatch repair.Thus, as in the MutSα-dependent eukaryotic pathway where genetic and biochemical studies have indicated a limited contribution of the MutSα-proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamp interaction to mismatch repair (39.Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 43.Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 13310-13319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), interaction of E. coli MutS with β clamp is not required for methyl-directed mismatch correction as judged by in vitro assay. Our biochemical experiments have also failed to reveal significant contributions of the γ complex clamp loader or Pol III core components to the initiation and excision steps of the methyl-directed mismatch correction. Despite these observations, we have confirmed previous findings that β interacts specifically with both MutS and MutL (11.López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12.López de Saro F.J. Marinus M.G. Modrich P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14340-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and that γ complex interacts with MutL (37.Li F. Liu Q. Chen Y.Y. Yu Z.N. Zhang Z.P. Zhou Y.F. Deng J.Y. Bi L.J. Zhang X.E. Mutat. Res. 2008; 637: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition we have shown that the γ complex interacts specifically with MutS and that Pol III core interacts with both MutS and MutL. In view of the role of mismatch repair in replication fidelity, such interactions may not be surprising, but our failure to identify the functional consequences of such interactions was unexpected.We have considered several explanations for these puzzling findings. Because the biochemical assays that we use to score mismatch repair rely on nonreplicating model heteroduplexes, our in vitro experiments may not accurately reproduce repair events that occur at the replication fork insofar as such interactions are concerned. An alternate view posits that our biochemical results are providing an accurate indication of the significance of these interactions in mismatch repair. As noted above, the limited in vitro consequences of inactivation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-binding site of human MutSα are consistent with the genetic consequences of inactivation of this motif within the yeast protein, and a similar consistency of biochemical and genetic findings applies if the MutS C-terminal β interaction motif is solely responsible for MutS-clamp interaction, as has been indicated by experiments performed in the absence of DNA (12.López de Saro F.J. Marinus M.G. Modrich P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14340-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this case, interactions that have limited implications for repair as deduced by biochemical methods could nevertheless be sufficiently significant in biological terms to confer selective advantage.There is, however, another way to think about the interaction of mismatch repair and replication activities. Like the study described here, previous work on this issue has been restricted to the significance of these interactions in the context of mismatch repair. A plausible alternative is that the functional consequences of these interactions are primarily manifested at the level of replication, providing a regulatory mechanism whereby mismatch repair proteins modulate fork activity in response to DNA lesions. Such a mechanism could be valuable for several reasons. It would permit replication error removal to be integrated into the context of replication fork events, an effect that might be particularly useful in those organisms where termini at the fork may provide the strand signals that direct mismatch repair (1.Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Burdett V. Modrich P.L. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 302-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 45.Pavlov Y.I. Mian I.M. Kunkel T.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 744-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It could in principle also function to regulate fork movement in response to a transient elevation of DNA biosynthetic errors such as those that may arise from transient nucleotide pool imbalances or chemical damage to exposed bases within template strands. The possibility of mismatch repair modulation of fork activities in response to chemical lesions may be particularly worth considering in the context of the mammalian mismatch repair system, which is known to participate in checkpoint and apoptotic responses to certain classes of DNA damage (1.Iyer R.R.

In Escherichia coli, the strand specificity necessary for removal of DNA biosynthetic errors from the daughter strand is based on the transient absence of d(GATC) methylation in newly synthesized DNA (4.Pukkila P.J. Peterson J. Herman G. Modrich P. Meselson M. Genetics. 1983; 104: 571-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A methyl-directed reaction that can account for replication error correction has been reconstituted using purified E. coli activities (5.Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P.

Assembly of a MutS-MutL-heteroduplex complex activates MutH endonuclease, which incises the unmethylated strand at a hemimethylated d(GATC) site (9.Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting strand break, which may reside 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch, serves as the entry site for an excision system comprised of DNA helicase II and an appropriate single-strand exonuclease. Excision directed by a 3′ strand break depends on the 3′ to 5′ hydrolytic activity of exonuclease I, exonuclease VII, or exonuclease X, whereas the 5′ to 3′ activity of either RecJ exonuclease or exonuclease VII is sufficient to support hydrolysis directed by a 5′ strand break (6.Cooper D.L.

The ensuing gap is repaired by DNA synthesis, in a reaction that depends on the integrity of dnaX (formerly called dnaZ) (5.Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P.

Direct interactions of the β clamp with MutS and MutL have been demonstrated (11.López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that this component of the replication apparatus could be involved in early steps of mismatch repair. Two MutS motifs have been implicated in this interaction, one located near the N terminus and the second near the C terminus. Deletion of the C-terminal motif (812QMSLL816) abolishes in vitro MutS interaction with β in the absence of DNA but does not confer hypermutability in vivo (12.López de Saro F.J. Marinus M.G. Modrich P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14340-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By contrast, Ala substitution mutagenesis within the N-terminal MutS motif (15QQYLRL20) is without effect in MutS-β interaction in solution but confers strong hypermutability in the E. coli cell. The latter finding has led to the proposal that the N-terminal β interaction motif of MutS might play an important role in the interaction of the two proteins, but only when they are DNA-bound. To clarify the role(s) of the β clamp in mismatch repair, we have evaluated the effects of the E. coli β, γ complex, and Pol III core on individual steps of the reconstituted E. coli methyl-directed reaction. Our results indicate that β is dispensable for MutH activation and excision steps of the reaction but essential for overall repair. DISCUSSIONSliding clamp involvement in mismatch repair has been the subject of extensive analysis. Popular models for clamp function in mismatch repair have invoked clamp-based recruitment of a MutS protein to sites of replication (11.López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nevertheless, inactivation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen interaction motif of yeast MutSα results in only a modest mutability increase (39.Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat.

However, because β is required for overall repair as scored using the same DNAs, we infer that the clamp plays an essential role during the repair DNA synthesis stage of mismatch correction. It is noteworthy that our findings do not exclude a role for β in providing a link between the excision and repair synthesis steps of mismatch correction, particularly in the case of 5′ heteroduplex repair where excision and repair synthesis could occur in a concerted manner.As discussed above, two potential β interaction motifs have been identified within E. coli MutS (11.López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12.López de Saro F.J. Marinus M.G. Modrich P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14340-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A C-terminal MutS element is a bona fide β interaction motif, conferring strong interaction with the clamp in vitro. Deletion of this motif (MutSC) abolishes in vitro interaction of the two proteins but does not result in elevated mutability in vivo (12.López de Saro F.J. Marinus M.G. Modrich P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14340-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although synthetic peptides containing the N-terminal motif interact with β, Ala substitution mutagenesis of this motif (MutSN) does not alter in vitro interaction of β with native MutS in the absence of DNA. However, the finding that the mutSN mutation results in hypermutability has led to the proposal that this sequence element may support β interaction, but only when the two proteins are DNA-bound. Our results suggest that this is not the case and that the biological phenotype associated with the mutSN mutation is the probable result of instability coupled with a general activity defect. It therefore seems likely that the MutS-β interaction is largely mediated via the C-terminal MutS motif and that this interaction is of limited significance during the early steps of methyl-directed mismatch repair.Thus, as in the MutSα-dependent eukaryotic pathway where genetic and biochemical studies have indicated a limited contribution of the MutSα-proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamp interaction to mismatch repair (39.Flores-Rozas H.

Our biochemical experiments have also failed to reveal significant contributions of the γ complex clamp loader or Pol III core components to the initiation and excision steps of the methyl-directed mismatch correction. Despite these observations, we have confirmed previous findings that β interacts specifically with both MutS and MutL (11.López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12.López de Saro F.J. Marinus M.G. Modrich P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

In addition we have shown that the γ complex interacts specifically with MutS and that Pol III core interacts with both MutS and MutL. In view of the role of mismatch repair in replication fidelity, such interactions may not be surprising, but our failure to identify the functional consequences of such interactions was unexpected.We have considered several explanations for these puzzling findings. Because the biochemical assays that we use to score mismatch repair rely on nonreplicating model heteroduplexes, our in vitro experiments may not accurately reproduce repair events that occur at the replication fork insofar as such interactions are concerned. An alternate view posits that our biochemical results are providing an accurate indication of the significance of these interactions in mismatch repair. As noted above, the limited in vitro consequences of inactivation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-binding site of human MutSα are consistent with the genetic consequences of inactivation of this motif within the yeast protein, and a similar consistency of biochemical and genetic findings applies if the MutS C-terminal β interaction motif is solely responsible for MutS-clamp interaction, as has been indicated by experiments performed in the absence of DNA (12.López de Saro F.J. Marinus M.G. Modrich P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14340-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this case, interactions that have limited implications for repair as deduced by biochemical methods could nevertheless be sufficiently significant in biological terms to confer selective advantage.There is, however, another way to think about the interaction of mismatch repair and replication activities. Like the study described here, previous work on this issue has been restricted to the significance of these interactions in the context of mismatch repair. A plausible alternative is that the functional consequences of these interactions are primarily manifested at the level of replication, providing a regulatory mechanism whereby mismatch repair proteins modulate fork activity in response to DNA lesions. Such a mechanism could be valuable for several reasons. It would permit replication error removal to be integrated into the context of replication fork events, an effect that might be particularly useful in those organisms where termini at the fork may provide the strand signals that direct mismatch repair (1.Iyer R.R.

It could in principle also function to regulate fork movement in response to a transient elevation of DNA biosynthetic errors such as those that may arise from transient nucleotide pool imbalances or chemical damage to exposed bases within template strands.

https://openalex.org/W1976014395,"While considerable evidence supports the causal relationship between increases in c-Myc (Myc) and cardiomyopathy as a part of a “fetal re-expression” pattern, the functional role of Myc in mechanisms of cardiomyopathy remains unclear. To address this, we developed a bitransgenic mouse that inducibly expresses Myc under the control of the cardiomyocyte-specific MHC promoter. In adult mice the induction of Myc expression in cardiomyocytes in the heart led to the development of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy followed by ventricular dysfunction and ultimately death from congestive heart failure. Mechanistically, following Myc activation, cell cycle markers and other indices of DNA replication were significantly increased suggesting that cell cycle-related events might be a primary mechanism of cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, pathological alterations at the cellular level included alterations in mitochondrial function with dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and defects in electron transport chain complexes I and III. These data are consistent with the known role of Myc in several different pathways including cell cycle activation, mitochondrial proliferation, and apoptosis, and indicate that Myc activation in cardiomyocytes is an important regulator of downstream pathological sequelae. Moreover, our findings indicate that the induction of Myc in cardiomyocytes is sufficient to cause cardiomyopathy and heart failure, and that sustained induction of Myc, leading to cell cycle re-entry in adult cardiomyocytes, represents a maladaptive response for the mature heart."
https://openalex.org/W2070571694,"The ascospores of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are surrounded by a complex wall that protects the spores from environmental stresses. The outermost layer of the spore wall is composed of a polymer that contains the cross-linked amino acid dityrosine. This dityrosine layer is important for stress resistance of the spore. This work reports that the dityrosine layer acts as a barrier blocking the diffusion of soluble proteins out of the spore wall into the cytoplasm of the ascus. Diffusion of a fluorescent protein out of the spore wall was used as an assay to screen for mutants affecting spore wall permeability. One of the genes identified in this screen, OSW3 (RRT12/YCR045c), encodes a subtilisin-family protease localized to the spore wall. Mutation of the active site serine of Osw3 results in spores with permeable walls, indicating that the catalytic activity of Osw3 is necessary for proper construction of the dityrosine layer. These results indicate that dityrosine promotes stress resistance by acting as a protective shell around the spore. OSW3 and other OSW genes identified in this screen are strong candidates to encode enzymes involved in assembly of this protective dityrosine coat."

We found that the expression of SOCS2 mRNA and protein is dramatically up-regulated during DC maturation. Silencing of SOCS2 using siRNA, inhibited DC maturation as evidenced by a decreased expression of maturation markers such as CD83, co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD86 and HLA-DR. Furthermore, silencing of SOCS2 decreased LPS induced activation of MAP kinases (SAKP/JNK, p38, ERK), IRF3, decreased the translocation of the NF-κB transcription factor and reduced downstream gene mRNA expression. These results suggest a role for SOCS2 in the MyD88-dependent and -independent TLR4 signaling pathways. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that SOCS2 is required for appropriate TLR4 signaling in maturating human DCs via both the MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1971440698,"Background Cocaine addiction is characterized as a chronically relapsing disorder. It is believed that cues present during self-administration become learned and increase the probability that relapse will occur when they are confronted during abstinence. However, the way in which relapse-inducing cues are interpreted by the user has remained elusive. Recent theories of addiction posit that relapse-inducing cues cause relapse habitually or automatically, bypassing processing information related to the consequences of relapse. Alternatively, other theories hypothesize that relapse-inducing cues produce an expectation of the drug's consequences, designated as goal-directed relapse. Discrete discriminative stimuli signaling the availability of cocaine produce robust cue-induced responding after thirty days of abstinence. However, it is not known whether cue-induced responding is a goal-directed action or habit. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested whether cue-induced responding is a goal-directed action or habit by explicitly pairing or unpairing cocaine with LiCl-induced sickness (n = 7/group), thereby decreasing or not altering the value of cocaine, respectively. Following thirty days of abstinence, no difference in responding between groups was found when animals were reintroduced to the self-administration environment alone, indicating habitual behavior. However, upon discriminative stimulus presentations, cocaine-sickness paired animals exhibited decreased cue-induced responding relative to unpaired controls, indicating goal-directed behavior. In spite of the difference between groups revealed during abstinent testing, no differences were found between groups when animals were under the influence of cocaine. Conclusions/Significance Unexpectedly, both habitual and goal-directed responding occurred during abstinent testing. Furthermore, habitual or goal-directed responding may have been induced by cues that differed in their correlation with the cocaine infusion. Non-discriminative stimulus cues were weak correlates of the infusion, which failed to evoke a representation of the value of cocaine and led to habitual behavior. However, the discriminative stimulus–nearly perfectly correlated with the infusion–likely evoked a representation of the value of the infusion and led to goal-directed behavior. These data indicate that abstinent cue-induced responding is multifaceted, dynamically engendering habitual or goal-directed behavior. Moreover, since goal-directed behavior terminated habitual behavior during testing, therapeutic approaches aimed at reducing the perceived value of cocaine in addicted individuals may reduce the capacity of cues to induce relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2138868364,"Background CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a central role in the immune balance to prevent autoimmune disease. One outstanding question is how Tregs suppress effector immune responses in human. Experiments in mice demonstrated that Treg restrict effector T cell (Teff) responses by deprivation of the growth factor IL-2 through Treg consumption, resulting in apoptosis of Teff. Principal Findings In this study we investigated the relevance of Teff apoptosis induction to human Treg function. To this end, we studied naturally occurring Treg (nTreg) from peripheral blood of healthy donors, and, to investigate Treg function in inflammation in vivo, Treg from synovial fluid of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) patients (SF-Treg). Both nTreg and SF-Treg suppress Teff proliferation and cytokine production efficiently as predicted. However, in contrast with murine Treg, neither nTreg nor SF-Treg induce apoptosis in Teff. Furthermore, exogenously supplied IL-2 and IL-7 reverse suppression, but do not influence apoptosis of Teff. Significance Our functional data here support that Treg are excellent clinical targets to counteract autoimmune diseases. For optimal functional outcome in human clinical trials, future work should focus on the ability of Treg to suppress proliferation and cytokine production of Teff, rather than induction of Teff apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2105112610,"Background Syndromic management is an inexpensive and effective method for the treatment of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but its effectiveness as a method of STI control in at-risk populations is questionable. We sought to determine the potential utility of syndromic management as a public health strategy to control STI transmission in high-risk populations in urban Peru. Methodology We surveyed 3,285 at-risk men and women from three Peruvian cities from 2003–05. Participants were asked about the presence of genital ulcers, discharge, or dysuria in the preceding six months. Participants reporting symptoms were asked about subsequent health-seeking and partner notification behavior. Urine and vaginal swab samples were tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis by nucleic acid testing. Serum was tested for syphilis and Herpes Simplex Virus-Type 2 antibodies. Findings Recent urogenital discharge or dysuria was reported by 42.1% of participants with gonorrhea or chlamydia versus 28.3% of participants without infection. Genital ulceration was reported by 6.2% of participants with, and 7.4% of participants without, recent syphilis. Many participants reporting symptoms continued sexual activity while symptomatic, and approximately half of all symptomatic participants sought treatment. The positive and negative predictive values of urogenital discharge or genital ulcer disease in detecting STIs that are common in the study population were 14.4% and 81.5% for chlamydia in women and 8.3% and 89.5% for syphilis among gay-identified men. Conclusions In our study, STIs among high-risk men and women in urban Peru were frequently asymptomatic and symptomatic participants often remained sexually active without seeking treatment. Additional research is needed to assess the costs and benefits of targeted, laboratory-based STI screening as part of a comprehensive STI control program in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W1977172227,"Introduction Little is known about the distribution of asthma severity in men and women in the general population. The objective of our study was to describe asthma severity and change in severity according to gender in a cohort of adult asthmatics Methods Subjects with asthma were identified from random samples of the 22 to 44 year-olds from the general population, screened for asthma from 1991 to 1993 in 48 centers from 22 countries and followed-up during 1998–2002, as part of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS). All participants to follow-up with current asthma at baseline were eligible for the analysis. To assess change over the follow-up, asthma severity at the two surveys was defined using standardized data on respiratory symptoms, lung function and medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Guidelines. Another quantitative score (Ronchetti) further considering hospitalizations was also analysed. Results The study included 685 subjects with asthma followed-up over a mean period of 8.65 yr (min 4.3-max 11.7). At baseline, asthma severity according to GINA was distributed as intermittent: 40.7%, 31.7% as mild persistent, 14% as moderate persistent, and 13.5% as severe persistent. Using the Ronchetti score derived classification, the distribution of asthma severity was 58% mild, (intermittent and mild persistent), 25.8% moderate, and 15.4% severe. Whatever the classification, there was no significant difference in the severity distribution between men and women. There was also no gender difference in the severity distribution among incident cases which developed asthma between the two surveys. Men with moderate-to-severe asthma at baseline were more likely than women to have moderate-to-severe asthma at follow-up. Using GINA, 69.2% of men vs. 53.1% of women (p = 0.09) with moderate-to-severe asthma at baseline were still moderate-to-severe at follow-up. Using Ronchetti score, 53.3% of men vs. 36.2% of women (p = 0.03) with moderate-to-severe asthma at baseline were still moderate-to-severe at follow-up. Conclusions There was no gender difference in asthma severity at the two surveys. However, our findings suggest that asthma severity might be less stable in women than in men."

We demonstrated previously that miconazole induces actin cytoskeleton stabilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae prior to induction of reactive oxygen species, pointing to an ancillary mode of action. Using a genome-wide agar-based screening, we demonstrate in this study that S. cerevisiae mutants affected in sphingolipid and ergosterol biosynthesis, namely ipt1, sur1, skn1, and erg3 deletion mutants, are miconazole-resistant, suggesting an involvement of membrane rafts in its mode of action. This is supported by the antagonizing effect of membrane raft-disturbing compounds on miconazole antifungal activity as well as on miconazole-induced actin cytoskeleton stabilization and reactive oxygen species accumulation. These antagonizing effects point to a primary role for membrane rafts in miconazole antifungal activity.

https://openalex.org/W2019355730,"The susceptibility of humans and animals to prion infections is determined by the virulence of the infectious agent, by genetic modifiers, and by hitherto unknown host and environmental risk factors. While little is known about the latter two, the activation state of the immune system was surmised to influence prion susceptibility. Here we administered prions to mice that were repeatedly immunized by two initial injections of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides followed by repeated injections of bovine serum albumin/alum. Immunization greatly reduced the required dosage of peripherally administered prion inoculum necessary to induce scrapie in 50% of mice. No difference in susceptibility was observed following intracerebral prion challenge. Due to its profound impact onto scrapie susceptibility, the host immune status may determine disease penetrance after low-dose prion exposure, including those that may give rise to iatrogenic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
https://openalex.org/W2005531278,"Background The katydid genus Neoconocephalus (25+ species) has a prominent acoustic communication system and occurs in large parts of the Neotropics and Nearctic. This group has been subject of numerous behavioral, physiological, and evolutionary studies of its acoustic communication system. Two distinct life histories occur in this group: The tropical life history incorporates multiple generations/year and direct egg development without environmental triggers. Temperate life history is characterized by overwintering in the egg stage, cold trigger of egg development, and one generation/year. This study reconstructs the phylogenetic relationships within the genus to (1) determine the evolutionary history of the temperate life history, and (2) to support comparative studies of evolutionary and physiological problems in this genus. Methodology/Principal Findings We used Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP), and sequences of two nuclear loci and one mitochondrial locus to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. The analysis included 17 ingroup and two outgroup species. AFLP and mitochondrial data provided resolution at the species level while the two nuclear loci revealed only deeper nodes. The data sets were combined in a super-matrix to estimate a total evidence tree. Seven of the temperate species form a monophyletic group; however, three more temperate species were placed as siblings of tropical species. Conclusions/Significance Our analyses support the reliability of the current taxonomic treatment of the Neoconocephalus fauna of Caribbean, Central, and North America. Ancestral state reconstruction of life history traits was not conclusive, however at least four transitions between life histories occurred among our sample of species. The proposed phylogeny will strengthen conclusions from comparative work in this group."
https://openalex.org/W1968181000,"The NIAID (National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases) Biodefense Proteomics program aims to identify targets for potential vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for agents of concern in bioterrorism, including bacterial, parasitic, and viral pathogens. The program includes seven Proteomics Research Centers, generating diverse types of pathogen-host data, including mass spectrometry, microarray transcriptional profiles, protein interactions, protein structures and biological reagents. The Biodefense Resource Center (www.proteomicsresource.org) has developed a bioinformatics framework, employing a protein-centric approach to integrate and support mining and analysis of the large and heterogeneous data. Underlying this approach is a data warehouse with comprehensive protein + gene identifier and name mappings and annotations extracted from over 100 molecular databases. Value-added annotations are provided for key proteins from experimental findings using controlled vocabulary. The availability of pathogen and host omics data in an integrated framework allows global analysis of the data and comparisons across different experiments and organisms, as illustrated in several case studies presented here. (1) The identification of a hypothetical protein with differential gene and protein expressions in two host systems (mouse macrophage and human HeLa cells) infected by different bacterial (Bacillus anthracis and Salmonella typhimurium) and viral (orthopox) pathogens suggesting that this protein can be prioritized for additional analysis and functional characterization. (2) The analysis of a vaccinia-human protein interaction network supplemented with protein accumulation levels led to the identification of human Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 4 protein as a potential therapeutic target. (3) Comparison of complete genomes from pathogenic variants coupled with experimental information on complete proteomes allowed the identification and prioritization of ten potential diagnostic targets from Bacillus anthracis. The integrative analysis across data sets from multiple centers can reveal potential functional significance and hidden relationships between pathogen and host proteins, thereby providing a systems approach to basic understanding of pathogenicity and target identification."
https://openalex.org/W2019907835,"Evidence regarding the association of variation within ADRB2, the gene encoding the beta-adrenergic receptor 2 (ADRB2) with obesity and hypertension is exceedingly ambiguous. Despite negative reports, functional impacts of individual genetic variants have been reported. Also, functional haplotypes as well as haplotype combinations affecting expression levels in vivo of ADRB2 mRNA and protein as well as receptor sensitivity have been reported. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate if variations within ADRB2 as haplotypes or as haplotype combinations confer an increased prevalence of obesity and hypertension among adults.We genotyped five variants required to capture common variation in a region including the ADRB2 locus in a population-based study of 6,514 unrelated, middle-aged Danes. Phases of the genotypes were estimated in silico. The variations were then investigated for their combined association with obesity, hypertension and related quantitative traits. The present study did not find consistent evidence for an association of ADRB2 variants with either obesity or hypertension when variations were analysed in a case-control study. The same lack of impact was also seen in the quantitative trait analyses, apart from nominal differences on waist-to-hip ratio and systolic blood pressure between specific haplotype combinations.In a population-based sample of 6,514 Danes we found no consistent associations between five common variants which tag the ADRB2 locus and prevalence of obesity or hypertension neither when analysed as individual haplotypes nor as haplotype pairs."
https://openalex.org/W1997988676,"15-Acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-AcDON) is a low molecular weight sesquiterpenoid trichothecene mycotoxin associated with Fusarium ear rot of maize and Fusarium head blight of small grain cereals. The accumulation of mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and 15-AcDON within harvested grain is subject to stringent regulation as both toxins pose dietary health risks to humans and animals. These toxins inhibit peptidyltransferase activity, which in turn limits eukaryotic protein synthesis. To assess the ability of intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) to modulate mycotoxin-specific cytotoxocity, a gene encoding a camelid single domain antibody fragment (V(H)H) with specificity and affinity for 15-AcDON was expressed in the methylotropic yeast Pichia pastoris. Cytotoxicity and V(H)H immunomodulation were assessed by continuous measurement of cellular growth. At equivalent doses, 15-AcDON was significantly more toxic to wild-type P. pastoris than was DON. In turn, DON was orders of magnitude more toxic than 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol. Intracellular expression of a mycotoxin-specific V(H)H within P. pastoris conveyed significant (p = 0.01) resistance to 15-AcDON cytotoxicity at doses ranging from 20 to 100 mug.ml(-1). We also documented a biochemical transformation of DON to 15-AcDON to account for the attenuation of DON cytotoxicity at 100 and 200 mug.ml(-1). The proof of concept established within this eukaryotic system suggests that in planta V(H)H expression may lead to enhanced tolerance to mycotoxins and thereby limit Fusarium infection of commercial agricultural crops."
https://openalex.org/W2167164604,"Identification of novel virulence factors is essential for understanding bacterial pathogenesis and designing antibacterial strategies. In this study, we uncover such a factor, termed KerV, in Proteobacteria. Experiments carried out in a variety of eukaryotic host infection models revealed that the virulence of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa kerV null mutant was compromised when it interacted with amoebae, plants, flies, and mice. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that KerV is a hypothetical methyltransferase and is well-conserved across numerous Proteobacteria, including both well-known and emerging pathogens (e.g., virulent Burkholderia, Escherichia, Shigella, Vibrio, Salmonella, Yersinia and Brucella species). Furthermore, among the 197 kerV orthologs analyzed in this study, about 89% reside in a defined genomic neighborhood, which also possesses essential DNA replication and repair genes and detoxification gene. Finally, infection of Drosophila melanogaster with null mutants demonstrated that KerV orthologs are also crucial in Vibrio cholerae and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis pathogenesis. Our findings suggested that KerV has a novel and broad significance as a virulence factor in pathogenic Proteobacteria and it might serve as a new target for antibiotic drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2136167990,"Background Highly parallel sequencing technologies have become important tools in the analysis of sequence polymorphisms on a genomic scale. However, the development of customized software to analyze data produced by these methods has lagged behind. Methods/Principal Findings Here I describe a tool, ‘galign’, designed to identify polymorphisms between sequence reads obtained using Illumina/Solexa technology and a reference genome. The ‘galign’ alignment tool does not use Smith-Waterman matrices for sequence comparisons. Instead, a simple algorithm comparing parsed sequence reads to parsed reference genome sequences is used. ‘galign’ output is geared towards immediate user application, displaying polymorphism locations, nucleotide changes, and relevant predicted amino-acid changes for ease of information processing. To do so, ‘galign’ requires several accessory files easily derived from an annotated reference genome. Direct sequencing as well as in silico studies demonstrate that ‘galign’ provides lesion predictions comparable in accuracy to available prediction programs, accompanied by greater processing speed and more user-friendly output. We demonstrate the use of ‘galign’ to identify mutations leading to phenotypic consequences in C. elegans. Conclusion/Significance Our studies suggest that ‘galign’ is a useful tool for polymorphism discovery, and is of immediate utility for sequence mining in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W1963626297,"Background Photosensitive epilepsy is a type of reflexive epilepsy triggered by various visual stimuli including colourful ones. Despite the ubiquitous presence of colorful displays, brain responses against different colour combinations are not properly studied. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we studied the photosensitivity of the human brain against three types of chromatic flickering stimuli by recording neuromagnetic brain responses (magnetoencephalogram, MEG) from nine adult controls, an unmedicated patient, a medicated patient, and two controls age-matched with patients. Dynamical complexities of MEG signals were investigated by a family of wavelet entropies. Wavelet entropy is a newly proposed measure to characterize large scale brain responses, which quantifies the degree of order/disorder associated with a multi-frequency signal response. In particular, we found that as compared to the unmedicated patient, controls showed significantly larger wavelet entropy values. We also found that Renyi entropy is the most powerful feature for the participant classification. Finally, we also demonstrated the effect of combinational chromatic sensitivity on the underlying order/disorder in MEG signals. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that when perturbed by potentially epileptic-triggering stimulus, healthy human brain manages to maintain a non-deterministic, possibly nonlinear state, with high degree of disorder, but an epileptic brain represents a highly ordered state which making it prone to hyper-excitation. Further, certain colour combination was found to be more threatening than other combinations."
