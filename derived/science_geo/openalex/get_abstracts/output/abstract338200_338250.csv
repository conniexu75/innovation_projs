https://openalex.org/W2029330825,"Experiments were initiated to determine whether microbes using a hydrocarbon as food could generate electrical energy. Experiments with ethane were unsuccessful, but when microbes or glucose oxidase were added to a solution of glucose, electrical output was observed, confirming in part previous observations. As far as we know, no one had previously tested hydrocarbons in this manner, although the several effects of microbial activity on redox potential are well known. Failure of the microbes employed to dehydrogenate ethane in the absence of molecular oxygen is discussed in the light of recently published experimental evidence."

https://openalex.org/W2002680610,"Rats made phenylketonuric by a diet containing high levels of either phenylalanine alone, or phenylalanine and tyrosine, show a marked reduction in total cerebral stores of serotonin. Evidence from studies both in vitro and in vivo indicates that an important mechanism of this impairment in the metabolism of serotonin is the inhibition by high levels of these amino acids of the active transport of the precursor of serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, into brain."

Induction is reversed by exposure to green light. A blue protein, presumably allophycocyanin (absorption maximum, 650 mmicro) has been demonstrated in aqueous extracts of the cyanophycean cells."
https://openalex.org/W2084940052,"The science of man-machine operating systems, which includes operations research and systems analysis, has achieved a substantial body of theory and application over the last 40 years. Its current strength prompts it to attack difficult large-scale problems while challenging the other relevant sciences to unite, not only with each other and operations and systems research, but also with society, to deal with some of the most widespread and important problems of our time."
https://openalex.org/W2052526095,"During the last two decades the earth sciences community has become persuaded that the earth is a dynamic body; an engine driven by its internal heat. The major surface manifestation of this dynamism has been fragmentation of the earth's outer shell and subsequent relative horizontal movement of the pieces on a large scale. The driving force is convection within the earth, but much remains to be learned about the nature of the convection and the composition of the earth's interior. The other terrestrial planets show evidence of once having been hot, but their surfaces suggest long-term stability and lack evidence of continuing convection."

Details of the action and the instrumentation required to record it are described.
https://openalex.org/W1664911395,"Chemical synthesis is the ultimate source of most of the new materials that serve society. Progress in chemical synthesis depends on comparable advances in other branches of chemistry, such as in analysis, methods for determining the intimate details of chemical structures and of reaction mechanisms, and theories of chemical structure and reactions. Recent progress in some of these areas of chemistry is described."

https://openalex.org/W1969818827,"Seedlings of Prunus avium and P. cerasus, grown from seed of infected trees, showed symptoms of cherry necrotic rusty mottle and sour cherry yellows diseases. No virus could be detected in the P. avium seedlings showing virus-like symptoms and only 10 percent of the 30 percent of P. cerasus seedlings showing symptoms contained virus. These results suggest that viruses may induce certain genetic abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W4241772449,"For many years American science in the late 19th century was regarded as an intellectual backwater. This view derived from the assumption that the health of American science at the time was equivalent to the condition of pure science, especially pure physics. However, a closer look reveals that there was considerable vitality in American scientific research, especially in the earth and life sciences. This vitality is explainable in part by the natural scientific resources of the American continent but also in part by the energy given science from religious impulses, social reformism, and practicality. Furthermore, contrary to recent assumptions, the federal government was a significant patron of American science. The portrait of American science circa 1880 advanced in this article suggests that the nation's scientific enterprise was characterized by pluralism of institutional support and motive and that such pluralism has historically been the normal mode."
https://openalex.org/W2003255324,"Our perception of the universe has been altered by recent discoveries in astronomy, discoveries of new objects and of new phenomena, coming from a wide range of observing techniques. By 1990 astronomers expect to know more about the distribution of mass in the universe, the physics of energetic sources, and the intricate interconnections of astrophysical processes on a variety of spatial and temporal scales."
https://openalex.org/W2051798516,"A law for loudness is proposed which implies detection and averaging in a general nonlinear device with excitation by a complex signal-noise wave form. This law provides a mechanistic explanation for subjective intensity in the general time varying case. Mathematical solutions to the general law may be obtained in certain elementary cases, the well-known power-law characteristic being an example. A modified Weber law is derived which is in good agreement with experiments at both small and moderate stimulus intensities."
https://openalex.org/W4251975994,"Current research in mathematics involves a wide variety of interlocking ideas, old and new. For example, results about the curves and surfaces defined by polynomial equations, as in algebraic geometry, appear in the study of solitary waves and also in the gauge theories in physics. Centuries-old problems in number theory have been solved, while others have been revealed as insoluble. The classification of all finite simple groups is nearly achieved (and the full treatment will be voluminous); the representation of groups aids in their application to the study of symmetry. These developments, and many others, attest to the vitality of mathematics."

The author argues that the past few years, in terms of new discoveries, new insight-and the new questions-have been among the most productive in the history of the field and puts into context his selection of some of the most important new developments in this fundamental science."

https://openalex.org/W2021019985,"The profession of engineering is evidencing important changes under the impact of the microprocessor and the energy crisis. Societal considerations are altering the normative criteria of engineering while computerized manufacturing systems require entirely new engineering approaches. The trend is toward greater autonomy of engineering from the traditional basic sciences. Significant changes in engineering education will be necessary. The new technological environment requires closer links among academia, industry, and the professional societies-engineering's essential triad."

https://openalex.org/W2118675417,"Industrial research in America faces a new era. Success will depend on a synthesis utilizing the strengths of industry, government, and academia to achieve industrial innovation. The origins of U.S. industrial research in the 19th century have led to its current traditions and philosophy. Vigorous, diverse, animated by both basic scientific knowledge and empirical techniques, it is today channeled by both societal needs and new technical possibilities. Many of its efforts involve fundamental research. Meeting future expectations will require even broader science, much of it from academia, as well as a license to function from governments and society."
