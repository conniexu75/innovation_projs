https://openalex.org/W2040490498,"Mars, like Earth, may have received its volatiles in the final stages of accretion, as a veneer of volatile-rich material similar to C3V carbonaceous chondrites. The high (40)Ar/(36)Ar ratio and low (36)Ar abundance on Mars, compared to data for other differentiated planets, suggest that Mars is depleted in volatiles relative to Earth-by a factor of 1.7 for K and 14 other moderately volatile elements and by a factor of 35 for (36)Ar and 15 other highly volatile elements. Using these two scaling factors, we have predicted martian abundances of 31 elements from terrestrial abundances. Comparison with the observed (36)Ar abundance suggests that outgassing on Mars has been about four times less complete than on Earth. Various predictions of the model can be checked against observation. The initial abundance of N, prior to escape, was about ten times the present value of 0.62 ppb, in good agreement with an independent estimate based on the observed enhancement in the martian (15)N/(14)N ratio (78,79). The initial water content corresponds to a 9-m layer, close to the value of >/=13 m inferred from the lack of an (18)O/(16)O fractionation (75). The predicted crustal Cl/S ratio of 0.23 agrees exactly with the value measured for martian dust (67); we estimate the thickness of this dust layer to be about 70 m. The predicted surface abundance of carbon, 290 g/cm(2), is 70 times greater than the atmospheric CO(2) value, but the CaCO(3) content inferred for martian dust (67) could account for at least one-quarter of the predicted value. The past atmospheric pressure, prior to formation of carbonates, could have been as high as 140 mbar, and possibly even 500 mbar. Finally, the predicted (129)Xe/(132)Xe ratio of 2.96 agrees fairly well with the observed value of 2.5(+2)(-1) (85). From the limited data available thus far, a curious dichotomy seems to be emerging among differentiated planets in the inner solar system. Two large planets (Earth and Venus) are fairly rich in volatiles, whereas three small planets (Mars, the moon, and the eucrite parent body-presumably the asteroid 4 Vesta) are poorer in volatiles by at least an order of magnitude. None of the obvious mechanisms seems capable of explaining this trend, and so we can only speculate that the same mechanism that stunted the growth of the smaller bodies prevented them from collecting their share of volatiles. But why then did the parent bodies of the chondrites and shergottites fare so much better? One of the driving forces behind the exploration of the solar system has always been the realization that these studies can provide essential clues to the intricate network of puzzles associated with the origin of life and its prevalence in the universe. In our own immediate neighborhood, Mars has always seemed to be the planet most likely to harbor extraterrestrial life, so the environment we have found in the vicinity of the two Viking landers is rather disappointing in this context. But the perspective we have gained through the present investigation suggests that this is not a necessary condition for planets at the distance of Mars from a solar-type central star. In other words, if it turns out that Mars is completely devoid of life, this does not mean that the zones around stars in which habitable planets can exist are much narrower than has been thought (114). Suppose Mars had been a larger planet-the size of Earth or Venus-and therefore had accumulated a thicker veneer and had also developed global tectonic activity on the scale exhibited by Earth. A much larger volatile reservoir would now be available, there would be repeated opportunities for tapping that reservoir, and the increased gravitational field would limit escape from the upper atmosphere. Such a planet could have produced and maintained a much thicker atmosphere, which should have permitted at least an intermittently clement climate to exist. How different would such a planet be from the present Mars? Could a stable, warm climate be maintained? It seems conceivable that an increase in the size of Mars might have compensated for its greater distance from the sun and that the life zone around our star would have been enlarged accordingly."

Ionic mobility of the radiation-produced hydrated electrons was 1.84 x 10(-3)cm(-2) volt(-1) sec(-1) +/- 10 percent. This value corresponds to a diffusion constant of 4.75 x 10(-5) cm(2) sec(-1).
https://openalex.org/W2051476625,A new tungsten boride has been prepared and has been assigned the formula WB(2). The assignment is based on comparison of the x-ray diffraction data of this boride with those of diborides of the AlB(2) type structure. Values of a(0) = 3.02 and c(0) = 3.05 were calculated for a hexagonal unit cell.

The time course of this inhibitory effect suggests that abscisin 11 acts at the shoot apex when the floral stimulus arrives there.

Thus gibberellic acid affected this growth directly rather than indirectly through an effect upon endosperm. However, root growth was promoted by gibberellic acid only on embryos attached to endosperm, suggesting an indirect effect of gibberellic acid upon growth."

https://openalex.org/W2009453675,"Data provided by earth-orbiting satellites and analyzed through specific computer techniques are rapidly providing policy-makers around the world with new information on the location and extent of their countries' renewable and nonrenewable resources. Development projects utilizing remote sensing technology are being supported, for example, by the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, and other international funding agencies. The Inter-American Development Bank is financing a natural resources inventory of five countries in Central America, and this will require the application of remote sensing in the analysis of 33 Landsat images covering the area. Although the Landsat program remains experimental in nature, studies pertaining to its follow-on aspects will ensure continuation of the program so that developed and developing countries will be able to maintain better control of the management of their natural resources."

https://openalex.org/W2014262073,"A discussion showed that in 1975, some 90% of the electric power generated in Texas was made by burning natural gas, but by 1985, if current plans are realized, 60% of it will be generated in plants burning coal and lignite, roughly half coal and half lignite. In 1975, the Texas Railroad Commission ordered major users of natural gas as a boiler fuel to restrict consumption. No new facilities burning natural gas were to be built and users of over 3 million cu ft/day were ordered to cut consumption by 10% by 1981 and 25% by 1985. The Texas Utilities Co., which had a lignite-fired plant in the 1920's, and has experimented with lignite ever since, already has several lignite-fired plants in operation or under construction. In 1985, it is contemplated that total lignite plant generating capacity will be 14,556 MW. Lignite-fueled plants are more expensive to build than plants using natural gas or oil as fuel. However, in 1976, Texas Utilities put the cost of lignite at $0.288/million Btu or about 14% of the market price of intrastate natural gas. It is estimated that 10 billion tons of Texas lignite lie within 200 ft of the surface, but estimatesmore » of the economically recoverable portion vary in the range 2.5 to 8.5 billion tons.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2081103108,Concentrations of nitrogen (as ammonium nitrate) of 50 kilo-grams per hectare and greater are toxic to tobacco seedlings; symptoms are poor growth and white leaves. The leaves have markedly less chlorophylls (especially chlorophyll a) and more carotene and xanthophyll than seedlings grown in media low in nitrogen. These ill eflects are aggravated by short supply of phosphorus; they can be counteracted by more liberal supply of phosphorus.

https://openalex.org/W2019036381,"A fixed-horn antenna having a beam 10° by 10°, and a switched-load radiometer with traveling-wave-maser preamplifier were used to observe the 21-cm spectrum of the Virgo cluster of galaxies. An upper limit to the antenna temperature is 0.024°K relative to regions outside the cluster with filters whose width is 2 Mc/sec. If the excitation temperature of the intergalactic hydrogen is enough greater than the background continuum radiation so that absorption can be ignored, and if the velocity spectrum is that defined by the galaxies, the density of optically thin neutral hydrogen in the cluster does not exceed that outside of the cluster by an amount that gives 5.6 × 1012 solar masses in the cluster."
