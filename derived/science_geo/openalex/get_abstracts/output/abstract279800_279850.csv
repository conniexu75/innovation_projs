https://openalex.org/W2044874761,"Thermal tolerances from square-wave cycled temperature acclimation were compared with those from constant acclimation temperatures. A response to the maximum temperature of the square-wave cycle occurred. The acclimation thermoperiod was varied from one-fourth to twice the 24-hour cycle, and a relative maximum of tolerance resulted for the 24-hour thermoperiod. This suggests physiological adaption to natural 24-hour thermoperiods."
https://openalex.org/W1981844864,"If a hetrogeneous mixture of particles of various sizes is frozen and thawed repeatedly, the particles are sorted into relatively uniformn groups by size. The movement of particles depends on the amount of water between the ice-water interface and the particle, the rate of freezing, the distribution of the particles by size, and the orientation of the freeze-thaw plane."
https://openalex.org/W2063832101,"Normal, nonoperated Swiss mice which had been inoculated intracerebrally with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus showed a 100-percent mortality within 8 days after virus challenge. Neonatally thymectomized mice, with or without empty intraperitoneal diffusion chambers, were protected from the lethal effects of the virus, with no animals dying within 14 days after inoculation. Cell-tight Millipore diffusion chambers containing newborn thymic tissue, implanted intraperitoneally into neonatally thymectomized mice, restored the susceptibility of 52 percent of these mice to the lethality of the virus infection. The percentage restoration with subcutaneous thymic grafting was similar. A humoral mechanism of action of the tissue in the chamber is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2061238995,"Water vapor altered the form and greatly increased the rate of decay of the electron-spin resonance pattern of long-lived free radicals obtained upon gamma irradiation of Artemia salina cysts ( brine shrimp eggs). These results, combined with data on radiation survival, indicate that the water vapor protects the cysts from radiation damage, or heals the damage. They also indicate that water protects the cysts from the effect of oxygen by neutralizing the radiation-induced free radicals before they can interact with oxygen to produce irreversible damage."
