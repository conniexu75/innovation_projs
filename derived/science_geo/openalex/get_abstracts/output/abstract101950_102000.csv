https://openalex.org/W2004559089,"While significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular events underlying the early specification of the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes, little information is available regarding the cellular or molecular basis for left-right (LR) differences in animal morphogenesis. We describe the expression patterns of three genes involved in LR determination in chick embryos: activin receptor IIa, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and cNR-1 (related to the mouse gene nodal). These genes are expressed asymmetrically during and after gastrulation and regulate the expression of one another in a sequential pathway. Moreover, manipulation of the sidedness of either activin protein or Shh expression alters heart situs. Together, these observations identify a cascade of molecular asymmetry in that determines morphological LR asymmetry in the chick embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1974010399,"DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is involved in DNA double-stranded break repair and V(D)J recombination, comprises a DNA-targeting component called Ku and an approximately 460 kDa catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs. Here, we describe the cloning of the DNA-PKcs cDNA and show that DNA-PKcs falls into the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase family. Biochemical assays, however, indicate that DNA-PK phosphorylates proteins but has no detectable activity toward lipids. Strikingly, DNA-PKcs is most similar to PI kinase family members involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and DNA damage responses. These include the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding proteins Tor1p, Tor2p, and FRAP, S. pombe rad3, and the product of the ataxia telangiectasia gene, mutations in which lead to genomic instability and predisposition to cancer. The relationship of these proteins to DNA-PKcs provides important clues to their mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W2020164587,Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) is a chemokine that has pro-inflammatory and stem cell inhibitory activities in vitro. Its biologic role in vivo was examined in mice in which the gene encoding MIP-1 alpha had been disrupted. Homozygous MIP-1 alpha mutant (-/-) mice were resistant to Coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis seen in infected wild-type (+/+) mice. Influenza virus-infected -/- mice had reduced pneumonitis and delayed clearance of the virus compared with infected +/+ mice. The -/- mice had no overt hematopoietic abnormalities. These results demonstrate that MIP-1 alpha is an important mediator of virus-induced inflammation in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2090601888,"We demonstrate that in S. cerevisiae the rate of ongoing S phase is slowed when the DNA is subjected to alkylation. Slowing of replication is dependent on the MEC1 and RAD53 genes, indicating that lesions alone do not slow replication in vivo and that the slowing is an active process. While it has been shown that a MEC1- and RAD53-dependent checkpoint responds to blocked replication or DNA damage by inhibiting the onset of mitosis, we demonstrate that this checkpoint must also have an additional target within S phase that controls replication rate. MEC1 is a homolog of the human ATM gene, which is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients. Like mec1 yeast, AT cells are characterized by damage-resistant DNA synthesis, highlighting the congruence of the yeast and mammalian systems."

https://openalex.org/W2067539799,Yeast chromosomes terminate in tracts of simple repetitive DNA (poly[G1-3T]). Mutations in the gene TEL1 result in shortened telomeres. Sequence analysis of TEL1 indicates that it encodes a very large (322 kDa) protein with amino acid motifs found in phosphatidylinositol/protein kinases. The closest homolog to TEL1 is the human ataxia telangiectasia gene.

https://openalex.org/W1999268206,"H-Y is a transplantation antigen that can lead to rejection of male organ and bone marrow grafts by female recipients, even if the donor and recipient match at the major histocompatibility locus of humans, the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) locus. However, the origin and function of H-Y antigens has eluded researchers for 40 years. One human H-Y antigen presented by HLA-B7 was identified as an 11-residue peptide derived from SMCY, an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded on the Y chromosome. The protein from the homologous gene on the X chromosome, SMCX, differs by two amino acid residues in the same region. The identification of H-Y may aid in transplantation prognosis, prenatal diagnosis, and fertilization strategies."

A defective herpes simplex virus type 1 vector expressing human tyrosine hydroxylase was delivered into the partially denervated striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, used as a model of Parkinson's disease. Efficient behavioral and biochemical recovery was maintained for 1 year after gene transfer. Biochemical recovery included increases in both striatal tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme activity and in extracellular dopamine concentrations. Persistence of human tyrosine hydroxylase was revealed by expression of RNA and immunoreactivity."

https://openalex.org/W2049422138,"The D. melanogaster mei-41 gene is required for DNA repair, mitotic chromosome stability, and normal levels of meiotic recombination in oocytes. Here we show that the predicted mei-41 protein is similar in sequence to the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia) protein from humans and to the yeast rad3 and Mec1p proteins. There is also extensive functional overlap between mei-41 and ATM. Like ATM-deficient cells, mei-41 cells are exquisitely sensitive to ionizing radiation and display high levels of mitotic chromosome instability. We also demonstrate that mei-41 cells, like ATM-deficient cells, fail to show an irradiation-induced delay in the entry into mitosis that is characteristic of normal cells. Thus, the mei-41 gene of Drosophila may be considered to be a functional homolog of the human ATM gene."

https://openalex.org/W1976686299,"Appendage formation in insects and vertebrates depends upon signals from both the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes. In Drosophila, wing formation is organized symmetrically around the DV boundary of the growing wing imaginal disc and requires interactions between dorsal and ventral cells. Compartmentalization of the wing disc, dorsal cell behavior, and the expression of two dorsally expressed putative signaling molecules, fringe (fng) and Serrate (Ser), are regulated by the apterous selector gene. Here, we demonstrate that fng and Ser have distinct roles in a novel cell recognition and signal induction process. fng serves as a boundary-determining molecule such that Ser is induced wherever cells expressing fng and cells not expressing fng are juxtaposed. Ser in turn triggers the expression of genes involved in wing growth and patterning on both sides of the DV boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2038787486,"Uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi) is a B. subtilis bacteriophage protein that protects the uracil-containing phage DNA by irreversibly inhibiting the key DNA repair enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG). The 1.9 A crystal structure of Ugi complexed to human UDG reveals that the Ugi structure, consisting of a twisted five-stranded antiparallel beta sheet and two alpha helices, binds by inserting a beta strand into the conserved DNA-binding groove of the enzyme without contacting the uracil specificity pocket. The resulting interface, which buries over 1200 A2 on Ugi and involves the entire beta sheet and an alpha helix, is polar and contains 22 water molecules. Ugi binds the sequence-conserved DNA-binding groove of UDG via shape and electrostatic complementarity, specific charged hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic packing enveloping Leu-272 from a protruding UDG loop. The apparent mimicry by Ugi of DNA interactions with UDG provides both a structural mechanism for UDG binding to DNA, including the enzyme-assisted expulsion of uracil from the DNA helix, and a crystallographic basis for the design of inhibitors with scientific and therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2085741168,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-mediated calcium (Ca2+) signaling is subject to cytosolic and luminal regulatory mechanisms. In Xenopus oocytes, Ca(2+)-sensitive gating of the IP3 receptor (IP3R) produces repetitive waves of Ca2+ release. We examined the role of the luminal Ca(2+)-binding protein calreticulin (CRT) in IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling by using Ca2+ wave activity as a sensitive Ca2+ release assay. Overexpression of CRT inhibited repetitive IP3-induced Ca2+ waves. Deletion mutagenesis demonstrated that CRT inhibition was mediated by the high affinity-low capacity Ca(2+)-binding domain, which contributes little to Ca2+ storage. This novel function of CRT in intracellular Ca2+ signaling may be regulated by Ca2+ occupancy of the high affinity binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1979154683,"Mutations at the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) locus in humans and mice result in abnormal growth of neural crest-derived cells, including melanocytes and Schwann cells. We have exploited a targeted disruption of the NF1 gene in mice to examine the role of neurofibromin in the acquisition of neurotrophin dependence in embryonic neurons. We show that both neural crest- and placode-derived sensory neurons isolated from NF1(-/-) embryos develop, extend neurites, and survive in the absence of neurotrophins, whereas their wild-type counterparts die rapidly unless nerve growth factor (NGF) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is added to the culture medium. Moreover, NF1 (-/-) sympathetic neurons survive for extended periods and acquire mature morphology in the presence of NGF-blocking antibodies. Our results are consistent with a model wherein neurofibromin acts as a negative regulator of neurotrophin-mediated signaling for survival of embryonic peripheral neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1601631630,"Melatonin protection against in vitro kainic acid-induced oxidative damage in homogenates from different rat brain regions is shown. Brain-disrupted cell homogenates from cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and corpus striatum were incubated with kainate (11.7 mM) with or without different concentrations of melatonin (0.1-4 mM). The concentration of malonaldehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenals was measured as an index of lipid peroxidation. Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats were used. When administered with kainate, melatonin markedly reduced lipid peroxidation in every brain region of both rat strains. The reduction in lipid peroxidation by melatonin was concentration-dependent and varied from 10% to 100%. The protection conferred by melatonin is likely due, at least in part, to its newly discovered, free radical scavenging ability."
https://openalex.org/W1994481836,"Activation of Ras by the exchange of bound GDP for GTP is predominantly catalyzed by the guanylnucleotide exchange factor SOS. Receptor tyrosine kinases increase Ras-GTP loading by targeting SOS to the plasma membrane location of Ras through the small adaptor protein Grb2. However, despite the continuous stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity, Ras activation is transient and, in the case of insulin, begins returning to the GDP-bound state within 5 min. We report here that the cascade of serine kinases activated directly by Ras results in a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-dependent phosphorylation of SOS and subsequent disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex, thereby interrupting the ability of SOS to catalyze nucleotide exchange on Ras.

However, Ras activation is transient and rapidly returns to the inactive state despite continuous activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and prolonged Shc tyrosine phosphorylation(6Yonezawa K.

Recently it has been reported that stimulation of several cell types with growth factors and other mitogenic agents results in the serine/threonine phosphorylation of SOS(10Buday L. Downward J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, SOS phosphorylation precedes an insulin-dependent disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex(7Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

The insulin time dependence of the SOS phosphorylation and uncoupling of Grb2 from SOS was consistent with the desensitization phase of Ras inactivation. To determine whether the ERK pathway is involved in this event, we used two independent approaches to inhibit MEK activity and, hence, ERK activation. In this study we demonstrate that prevention of insulin-stimulated SOS phosphorylation and subsequent disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex results in a prolongation of Ras activation. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human insulin receptor (CHO/IR) and 3T3L1 adipocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously(7Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 16 h in serum-free media and then pretreated for 1 h with vehicle (0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide) or 100 μM PD98059. The cells were then incubated with and without 100 nM insulin for various times, followed by lysis in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 2 μM pepstatin, 0.5 trypsin inhibitory unit of aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μM leupeptin. Grb2 was immunoprecipitated from the whole cell lysates by incubation with a Grb2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4°C. The resultant immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4°C. The pellets were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl), resuspended in SDS-sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and heated at 100°C for 5 min. Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated on reducing 5-10% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using 1 A for 2 h at 4°C. Immunoblotting of the whole cell lysates or Grb2 immunoprecipitates was performed using an ERK polyclonal antibody (Zymed), a pp90rsk polyclonal antibody, or a Raf polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a SOS polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc). We have recently demonstrated that electroporation can be used to express various cDNAs in CHO/IR with 85-100% transfection efficiency (13Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO/IR cells were electroporated with a total of 40 μg of the dominant-interfering MEK mutant (MEK/K97R) or the empty parent vector (CMV5) at 340 V and 960 microfarads in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Following electroporation, the cells were plated in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% serum. Cell debris was removed by replacing media with fresh media 12 h later. CHO/IR cells were incubated in serum- and phosphate-free media for 2 h, followed by the addition of 0.2 mCi/ml carrier-free 32P for 3 h. The cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide) or 100 μM PD98059 during the last hour of the labeling period. Cells were then either left untreated or stimulated with 100 nM insulin for the indicated times. Cells were solubilized in 50 mM Hepes, 1 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mM GTP, 0.1 mM GDP, 1 mM ATP, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 mM benzamide. The extract was immunoprecipitated with the Ras antibody (Y13-259, Oncogene Science) for 60 min, and the immune complexes were washed 5 times with lysis buffer and 5 times with wash buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% SDS). Ras-associated guanylnucleotides were eluted in 20 μl of 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% SDS, 0.5 mM GTP, and 0.5 mM GDP) at 65°C for 20 min. Eluted GDP and GTP were separated on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Baker) by thin layer chromatography using 1 M KH2PO4 (pH 3.4) as the solvent. Labeled nucleotides were visualized by autoradiography and counted using an AMBIS β detector. To investigate the role of the ERK pathway mediating SOS phosphorylation and disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex, we initially took advantage of the recently identified specific inhibitor of MEK activity, PD98059(14Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 15Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). This reagent is noncompetitive for ATP and does not affect the enzyme activities of over 30 tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases examined, including the highly related Jun kinase kinase, JNKK. Since MEK is the immediate upstream kinase responsible for ERK phosphorylation, we examined the effect of PD98059 on insulin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1a). Insulin treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing high levels of the insulin receptor (CHO/IR) resulted in a timedependent phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 characterized by decreased electrophoretic mobility(1de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Burgering B.M.T. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Bos J.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 602-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of ERK was transient, with a maximal decrease in mobility following 5 min of insulin stimulation and a return to the basal state by 30 min (Fig. 1a, left, lanes 1-6). Pretreatment of cells with PD98059 prior to insulin stimulation markedly reduced the extent of ERK phosphorylation, as indicated by the near-complete absence of the slower migrating isoforms of ERK (Fig. 1a, right, lanes 1-6). MEK is activated by serine phosphorylation catalyzed by members of the Raf family of protein kinases(16Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 17Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Reuter C.W.M. Catling A.D. Jelinek T. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7644-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The Raf kinase lies in a feedback pathway, in which Raf undergoes phosphorylation secondary to ERK activation(19Anderson N.G. Li P. Marsden L.A. Williams N. Roberts T.M. Sturgill T.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Ueki K. Matsuda S. Tobe K. Gotoh Y. Tamemoto H. Yachi M. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Nishida E. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15756-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, insulin also stimulated a characteristic time-dependent gel shift of Raf which was initially detected at 5 min and was maximal by 10 min (Fig. 1b, left, lanes 1-6). In contrast to ERK, the decrease in Raf electrophoretic mobility persisted over the 30-min time period examined. However, pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor prevented the insulin-stimulated Raf gel shift (Fig. 1b, right, lanes 1-6) but did not block Raf kinase activity (data not shown). These data further demonstrate that Raf phosphorylation occurs by a MEK-dependent feedback pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated that SOS is phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues following growth factor activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway(11Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, insulin stimulated a time-dependent reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of SOS (Fig. 1c). The decrease in SOS mobility was detected following 5 min of insulin treatment with a maximal effect reached by 10 min (Fig. 1c, left, lanes 1-6). Pretreatment of the cells with PD98059 also prevented the insulin-stimulated SOS gel shift (Fig. 1c, right, lanes 1-6), consistent with a role of MEK in the cascade leading to the phosphorylation of SOS. In addition to the stimulation of SOS phosphorylation, various agents which activate the ERK pathway have also been observed to induce the disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex(7Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Grb2 from unstimulated cells resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of SOS (Fig. 1d, left, lane 1). A similar amount of co-immunoprecipitated SOS was detected in the Grb2 immunoprecipitates from cells treated with insulin for 3 min (Fig. 1d, left, lane 2). However, following 10 or 30 min of insulin stimulation, there was a marked decrease in the ability of the Grb2 antibody to co-immunoprecipitate SOS (Fig. 1d, left, lanes 3 and 4). Pretreatment with PD98059 had no significant effect on the extent of Grb2-SOS association from unstimulated cells or from cells treated with insulin for 3 min (Fig. 1d, right, lanes 1 and 2). However, the MEK inhibitor completely blocked the disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex following 10 and 30 min of insulin stimulation (Fig. 1d, right, lanes 3 and 4). Neither insulin nor PD98059 had any effect on the amount of Grb2 protein that was immunoprecipitated by the Grb2 antibody (data not shown). To ensure that the effect of MEK inhibition on Grb2-SOS interactions was not cell type-specific, we also determined the effect of PD98059 on 3T3L1 adipocytes. As observed in the CHO/IR cells, insulin stimulation for 5 min resulted in the characteristic decrease in electrophoretic mobility characteristic of ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2a, lanes 1 and 2). Pretreatment of the 3T3L1 adipocytes with PD98059 completely prevented the insulin stimulation of ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2a, lanes 3 and 4). Similarly, PD98059 also inhibited the phosphorylation of SOS following 15 min of insulin stimulation (Fig. 2b) and the subsequent disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex (Fig. 2c). Thus, the insulin-stimulated pathways leading to SOS phosphorylation and disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex converged at the level of MEK in both CHO/IR cells and 3T3L1 adipocytes. Since Ras desensitization and the disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex were temporally related, we examined the effect of the MEK inhibitor on insulin-stimulated Ras-GTP loading (Fig. 3). In the absence of insulin, a small fraction of Ras was in the GTP-bound state (Fig. 3a, lane 1). Insulin stimulated a rapid increase in the amount of GTP-bound Ras (Fig. 3a, lanes 2 and 3) which subsequently declined by 5 min but did not completely return to the basal state by 30 min (Fig. 3a, lanes 4-6). Pretreatment of cells with the MEK inhibitor had no significant effect on the initial (1-3 min) insulin-stimulated increase in GTP-bound Ras (Fig. 3B, lanes 1-3), but significantly prolonged the amount of Ras that remained in the GTP-bound state between 5 and 30 min (Fig. 3B, lanes 4-6). These data demonstrate that in the continuous presence of insulin the transient nature of GTP-bound Ras was dependent on the disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex. Although PD98059 has thus far proven to be a specific inhibitor of MEK activity, we also examined the relationship between SOS phosphorylation, Grb2-SOS disassociation, and Ras-GTP loading using an alternative mechanism to prevent MEK activation. In these studies, we took advantage of a transient electroporation method (13Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that results in the quantitative expression of a dominant-interfering MEK mutant (MEK/K97R) in CHO/IR cells(16Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Transfection of cells with an empty vector did not affect insulin-induced ERK (Fig. 4a, lanes 4-6), Raf (Fig. 4b, lanes 4-6), Rsk (Fig. 4c, lanes 4-6) or SOS (Fig. 4d, lanes 4-6) gel shifts. In contrast, expression of the dominant-interfering kinase-defective MEK mutant markedly reduced the insulin-stimulated ERK (Fig. 4a, lanes 1-3), Raf (Fig. 4b, lanes 1-3), Rsk (Fig. 4c, lanes 1-3), and SOS (Fig. 4d, lanes 1-3) gel shifts. Moreover, as observed with the MEK inhibitor, expression of the dominant-interfering MEK mutant prevented the disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex (Fig. 4e, lanes 1-6). In addition, expression of the dominant-interfering MEK mutant decreased the desensitization of Ras resulting in a prolonged increase in GTP loading (Fig. 4f). Together, these data provide evidence that the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation and disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex occurs in a MEK-dependent manner. Furthermore, the persistent association of the Grb2-SOS complex resulted in a prolonged activation of Ras suggesting that the uncoupling of Grb2 from SOS is at least one mechanism accounting for the inactivation of Ras. Since persistent Ras activation results in profound changes in cell growth and development, the molecular mechanism(s) regulating the desensitization of GTP loading is a critical feature of normal Ras function. Although our data have demonstrated that phosphorylation of SOS is MEK-dependent, several studies have observed that ERK can phosphorylate SOS both in vivo(20Ueki K. Matsuda S. Tobe K. Gotoh Y.

Further studies are necessary to determine the specific kinases and sites of SOS phosphorylation that are responsible for the disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex leading to Ras inactivation We wish to thank Daniel Cahoy for excellent technical support."
https://openalex.org/W2014234175,"We have identified a target antigen in autoimmune cerebellar degeneration, beta-NAP, that is closely related to the beta-adaptin and beta-COP coat proteins. Beta-NAP is a nonclathrin-associated phosphoprotein expressed exclusively in neurons, from E12 through adulthood. Beta-NAP is present in the neuronal soma and nerve terminal as soluble and membrane-bound pools and is associated with a discrete set of nerve-terminal vesicles. These results establish beta-NAP as a neuron-specific vesicle coat protein. We propose a model in which beta-NAP mediates vesicle transport between the soma and the axon terminus and suggest that beta-NAP may represent a general class of coat proteins that mediates apical transport in polarized cells."

Local activation of the protease cascade depends on a positional cue that is laid down during oogenesis outside the oocyte. Here we present evidence that the nudel gene encodes an essential component of this cue. The nudel gene, which is expressed in follicle cells covering the oocyte, encodes an unusual mosaic protein resembling an extracellular matrix protein with a central serine protease domain. Our findings suggest that embryonic dorsoventral polarity is defined by a positional cue that requires the nudel protein to anchor and to trigger the protease cascade producing the polarity-inducing signal."

A viral reservoir is frequently established in V beta 12 T cells in HIV-1-infected patients. Here we show that cytomegalovirus (CMV) is responsible for V beta 12-selective HIV-1 replication that is indistinguishable from the effect of known superantigens (SAGs). This effect is dependent on direct contact of T cells with CMV-infected monocytes. CMV infection, but not ie1 or ie2 transfection, reproduces this effect in a monocytoid cell line (U937). In HIV-infected patients, the presence of CMV antibodies correlates with an HIV-1 viral load preferentially skewed to the V beta 12 subset.

Animal experiments have shown MeSO2-DDE to be adrenotoxic to several species after bioactivation in adrenal cortex mitochondria(3Jönsson C.-J. Lund B.-O. Brunström B. Brandt I. Environ. Toxicol.

Rodriguez-Martinez H. Lund B.-O. Bergman Å. Brandt I. Fund. Appl. Toxicol. 1991; 16: 365-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, human adrenal mitochondria have also been demonstrated to bioactivate MeSO2-DDE in vitro(8Jönsson C.-J. Lund B.-O. Toxicol. Lett. 1994; 71: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has been suggested, but never demonstrated, that the bioactivation is mediated by mitochondrial cytochrome P450(7Jönsson C.-J. Rodriguez-Martinez H. Lund B.-O. Bergman Å. Brandt I. Fund. Appl. Toxicol. 1991; 16: 365-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adrenal gland contains several P450 isozymes, but in contrast to hepatic P450s, adrenal P450s are generally not active in xenobiotic metabolism. The genes encoding the mitochondrial P450 11β-hydroxylase (P450c11), cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc), and aldosterone synthase (P450aldo) belong to the Cyp11 subfamily of the P450 superfamily of genes(9Miller W.L. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). These enzymes show a strict substrate specificity and are therefore not believed to metabolize xenobiotics. P450scc is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in steroid hormone synthesis, localized in all steroidogenic tissues, whereas P450c11 and P450aldo are specifically localized in the adrenal cortex. The latter two participate as the last enzymes in the synthesis of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, respectively. Given the specific mitochondrial damage in the adrenal cortex after MeSO2-DDE exposure, we decided to investigate the possible involvement of steroidogenic mitochondrial P450s in the metabolism of MeSO2-DDE. For this purpose we studied the bioactivation of MeSO2-DDE, i.e. the metabolic formation of reactive MeSO2-DDE intermediates capable of binding irreversibly to macromolecules or cellular antioxidants, in the mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line Y1. We also studied the bioactivation of MeSO2-DDE in a mutant of the Y1 cell line, Kin-8, that harbors a defect in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase(10Wong M. Rice D.A. Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12867-12871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which normally participates in the hormonal regulation of the steroid-metabolizing enzymes. In Kin-8 cells, as opposed to Y1 cells, ACTH, forskolin, or cAMP are inefficient inducers of the P450 isozymes expressed in these cells, i.e. mitochondrial P450scc, P450c11, and P450aldo. To unambiguously demonstrate the relative importance of the adrenal mitochondrial P450s in the bioactivation of MeSO2-DDE, experiments were finally conducted in monkey kidney COS cells. These cells do not normally metabolize steroids or MeSO2-DDE, so by investigating the MeSO2-DDE-metabolizing capacity in COS cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding the three mitochondrial P450s we tried to identify the enzyme responsible for bioactivation, and presumably toxicity, of MeSO2-DDE. 3-methylsulfonyl-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethene 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethene cytochrome P450 11β-hydroxylase cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme aldosterone synthase high performance liquid chromatography adrenodoxin. Culture of the adrenocortical cell lines Y1 and Kin-8, as well as of COS cells, were performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Experiments were conducted using subconfluent cultures containing approximately 2 × 106 cells/30-mm plate. In some experiments Y1 and Kin-8 cells were treated with forskolin (10 μM, in Me2SO, Sigma) for 18 h before other additions. Steroid substrates (20 μM, Sigma) and MeSO2-DDE (synthesized according to (4Lund B.-O. Bergman Å. Brandt I. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1988; 65: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) were added from 1000-fold stocksolutions in Me2SO. Enzyme assays were performed after growing cells in the presence of steroid substrate (deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, or 22-hydroxycholesterol). A 500-μl aliquot of the medium was removed and extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1). After one additional extraction of the medium with chloroform, the chloroform phases were pooled, evaporated, and dissolved in 50% acetonitrile for HPLC analyses of corticosterone and aldosterone as described previously (11Lund B-O. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1994; 13: 911-917Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Pregnenolone in the medium was quantitatively converted to progesterone with 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Sigma) according to Talalay and Dobson (12Talalay P. Dobson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 205: 823-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before extraction of the medium. Formed progesterone was then quantified by HPLC as above. Metabolism of MeSO2-DDE was examined after growing cells in the presence of [14C]MeSO2-DDE (13.4 mCi/mmol). The medium was removed, and the cells washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 500 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline. The culture medium and the cell suspensions were immediately extracted with three volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1), followed by centrifugation (300 × g, 15 min). The medium was extracted once more with chloroform, and the concentration of hydrophilic [14C]MeSO2-DDE metabolites in the hydrophilic phase was measured by liquid scintillation. The protein pellet was exhaustively extracted by repeatedly solubilizing the protein in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and precipitating with acetone as described by Baker and Van Dyke(13Baker M.T. Van Dyke R.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The protein was finally dissolved in NaOH, and aliquots were assayed for protein (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and irreversibly bound radioactivity. Transfection studies were performed on COS cells grown on 30-mm plates until almost confluent, when they received new medium containing 3 μg of DNA (2 μg of P450 +1 μg of adrenodoxin (ADX)) in the transfection reagent DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim). After a 20-h transfection period, the cells were grown for 24 h in fresh medium and then new medium containing 20 μM steroid substrate or 4 μM [14C]MeSO2-DDE was added. Medium and cells were harvested after 24 h of incubation, and enzyme activities as well as [14C]MeSO2-DDE metabolism assayed as described above. Upon treatment of adrenocortical Y1 cells with forskolin, which stimulates adenylate cyclase, these cells metabolized MeSO2-DDE to intermediates that reacted with cellular protein (Fig. 1a) and gave rise to hydrophilic MeSO2-DDE metabolites (Fig. 1b). By thin layer chromatography analyses of the hydrophilic MeSO2-DDE metabolites, the presence of ninhydrin-positive MeSO2-DDE metabolites, presumably glutathione conjugates, was indicated (data not shown). The lack of MeSO2-DDE metabolism in unstimulated cells and the minimal MeSO2-DDE metabolism in forskolin-stimulated Kin-8 cells (Fig. 1) suggested the involvement of cAMP-inducible steroidogenic enzymes in the metabolism of MeSO2-DDE. A similar inducibility of MeSO2-DDE metabolism and one steroid hydroxylase, P450c11, by forskolin in Y1 and Kin-8 cells (Fig. 2) further supported the involvement of steroidogenic P450 in MeSO2-DDE metabolism.Figure 2:P450c11 activity in normal and forskolin-induced Y1 and Kin-8 cells. The mutant Kin-8 has a defect cAMP-dependent protein kinase, strongly decreasing the expression and inducibility of P450scc and P450c11(8Jönsson C.-J. Lund B.-O. Toxicol. Lett. 1994; 71: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).

This metabolism was assessed in COS cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding mouse P450c11, P450scc, and P450aldo, respectively, either alone or in combination with a plasmid encoding bovine adrenocortical ADX(15Domalik L.J.

Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Adrenodoxin is an iron-sulfur protein that participates in the transfer of electrons from NADPH to the mitochondrial P450s, a process previously shown to be rate-limiting for steroid hydroxylations in transfected COS cells(16Zuber M.X. Mason J.I. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Table 1, the transfections were successful, although cotransfection with the ADX plasmid was necessary to obtain high P450 activities with the respective substrates. Only cells transfected with P450c11 metabolized MeSO2-DDE to any significant extent, as determined by the formation of hydrophilic MeSO2-DDE metabolites in the medium (Table 1), and irreversible binding of MeSO2-DDE to protein (Fig. 3). Thus, both formation of hydrophilic metabolites and irreversible protein binding of MeSO2-DDE is mediated by the same isozyme, i.e. P450c11.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In vivo exposure of mice to MeSO2-DDE and in vitro experiments with subcellular adrenal homogenates have shown a selective irreversible binding of MeSO2-DDE in the adrenal cortex(4Lund B.-O.

Toxicol. 1991; 16: 365-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies provide direct evidence for an involvement of adrenocortical mitochondrial P450s in the bioactivation of MeSO2-DDE, by showing that minimal MeSO2-DDE or deoxycorticosterone metabolism occurred in uninduced adrenocortical cells and that forskolin induction increased the metabolism of both substrates to the same extent. Furthermore, we unambiguously ascribe the metabolism of MeSO2-DDE to P450c11 through transfection studies in COS cells. To our knowledge, this is the first example of xenobiotic-induced toxicity mediated by mitochondrial steroid-metabolizing P450s. In addition, at concentrations only slightly affecting the cell number (assessed as amount of protein per plate), MeSO2-DDE was a potent inhibitor of the P450c11-activity in the Y1 cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, equal concentrations of the non-adrenotoxic DDE did not affect P450c11 or cell number (data not shown). This finding may provide an explanation to the previously observed reduced capacity of mice exposed to MeSO2-DDE to synthesize glucocorticoids(6Jönsson C.-J. Pharm. Toxicol. 1994; 74: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This study thus illustrates two mechanisms, bioactivation of xenobiotics and inhibition of steroid hydroxylases, whereby xenobiotics may interfere with glucocorticoid synthesis. Because the adrenal gland generally accumulates high levels of lipophilic xenobiotics(17Hornsby P.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Szabo S. Lippe I.Th. Toxicol. Pathol. 1989; 17: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and since a normal capacity to produce glucocorticoids is vital for organisms during stressful periods, the ability of certain xenobiotics to interfere with steroid hormone synthesis may have great significance and deserves further attention. We are grateful to Drs. K. Parker for the P450 cDNAs, M. Waterman for the adrenodoxin cDNA, B. Schimmer for the Kin-8 cells, Å. Bergman for synthesis of MeSO2-DDE, and M. Bakke for technical advice."

Although this antibody reacts with HRS, it is unclear whether HRS is the stimulating antigen or is merely a protein that cross-reacts with a yet undefined antigen. Because antibody directed against an unrelated antigen would not be expected to cross-react with HRS at multiple sites, we mapped the epitopes on HRS to resolve this issue. We found by Western blot analyses that immunoglobulins G (IgG) from 18 of 19 anti-HRS positive patient sera react with amino acids 2-44 and 286-509 of HRS. Patient IgG specific for these two epitopes were found not to inhibit HRS enzyme activity. Instead, the inhibitory property of anti-HRS was found to be associated with antibodies that do not react to HRS in immunoblots, indicating the presence of other epitopes. In addition, antibodies that react in immunoblots were found to represent only a small fraction of total anti-HRS antibody.

We have used differential display polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of mRNA to identify other mRNA species that are regulated by collagen and/or retinoic acid in UMR201 cells. A number of differentially expressed PCR products were isolated, whose sequences did not correspond to known sequences in the data bank. However, one species which was up-regulated by growth on collagen showed 95 and 94% homology to the murine and canine 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle (SRP54), respectively. In time course experiments, using reverse transcription PCR, it was found that SRP54 mRNA was up-regulated in UMR201 cells as early as 1 h after subculture onto collagen, when compared with cells subcultured onto plastic, and levels remained elevated after 48 h. The increased expression of SRP54 paralleled the increased expression of a known secreted protein, osteopontin. SRP54 recognizes signal sequences of proteins destined for secretion and retards them for further elongation in the endoplasmic reticulum. The increased expression may correlate with the synthesis of specific extracellular matrix molecules in differentiating osteoblasts. Rat preosteoblastic cells, UMR201, develop a more mature phenotype when subcultured onto a type I collagen gel when compared with their growth on plastic. Basal osteopontin mRNA expression is up-regulated, whereas retinoic acid-induced alkaline phosphatase expression is reduced in cells on collagen when compared with cells plated onto plastic. We have used differential display polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of mRNA to identify other mRNA species that are regulated by collagen and/or retinoic acid in UMR201 cells. A number of differentially expressed PCR products were isolated, whose sequences did not correspond to known sequences in the data bank. However, one species which was up-regulated by growth on collagen showed 95 and 94% homology to the murine and canine 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle (SRP54), respectively. In time course experiments, using reverse transcription PCR, it was found that SRP54 mRNA was up-regulated in UMR201 cells as early as 1 h after subculture onto collagen, when compared with cells subcultured onto plastic, and levels remained elevated after 48 h. The increased expression of SRP54 paralleled the increased expression of a known secreted protein, osteopontin. SRP54 recognizes signal sequences of proteins destined for secretion and retards them for further elongation in the endoplasmic reticulum. The increased expression may correlate with the synthesis of specific extracellular matrix molecules in differentiating osteoblasts. It is well recognized that the extracellular matrix environment can regulate gene expression of cells in a tissue-specific manner (for review, see (1Jones P.L. Schmidhauser C. Bissell M.J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 137-154PubMed Google Scholar)). Differentiation has been demonstrated in mammary gland epithelial cells cultured onto either type I collagen gels or a reconstituted basement membrane material(2Streuli C.H. Bissell M.J. J.

Biochem. 1992; 49: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Since previous studies from our group have demonstrated that plating cells on a collagen substratum gave definitive and reproducible changes (7Traianedes K. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in the differentiation profile of rat osteoblastic cells, we used differential display-polymerase chain reaction (dd-PCR) to identify other genes whose expression is regulated either by collagen substratum and/or RA. The technique of differential display of mRNA species (13Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar) has recently been used to determine differentially regulated mRNA species between comparative populations of cells(14Sager R. Anisowicz A. Neveu M. Liang P. Sotiropoulou G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 964-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), tissues(15Bauer D. Müller H. Reich J. Riedel H. Ahrenkiel V. Warthoe P.

Using this technique, we have identified a regulated mRNA species that codes for a protein involved in the protein secretory pathway. Most proteins destined for secretion first pass through the endoplasmic reticulum (for reviews, see refs. 17-19). Identification and targeting of nascent polypeptide chains is apparently achieved by the binding of the 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle (SRP54). Evidence suggests that SRP54 binds to the signal sequence as it emerges from the ribosome, thereby forming a complex and retarding further elongation of the polypeptide chain. This ribosome-SRP complex then binds to the SRP receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The ribosome forms a complex with the “translocon,” translation elongation resumes, and SRP54 is released for another round of targeting(17Walter P. Lingappa V.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 499-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 19Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The regulation of this mRNA species has not been reported previously. We have identified a 267-bp sequence of the rat homologue of SRP54 using dd-PCR and show that this mRNA species was up-regulated when preosteoblastic cells, UMR201, were plated on a physiological substratum. The up-regulation of this mRNA species may be related to the differentiation state of the preosteoblasts. A more differentiated state of these cells in response to plating on type I collagen is demonstrated with concomitant up-regulation of OP mRNA, a secreted protein which is a recognized marker of osteoblast differentiation. The rat preosteoblast cell line, UMR201(9Ng K.W. Gummer P.R. Michelangeli V.P. Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Cole W.G. Martin T.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was used in all experiments as described previously(7Traianedes K. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were routinely grown in α-modified minimal essential medium (α-MEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Cytosystems, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia). All media contained gentamicin (80 mg/ml) (David Bull Laboratories, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia) and minocycline (1 mg/ml) (Sigma). Incubations were carried out at 37°C and equilibrated with 5% CO2 in humidified air. Cells were used between passages 9 and 11(9Ng K.W. Gummer P.R. Michelangeli V.P. Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Cole W.G. Martin T.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells on plastic were harvested using phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mM EDTA. All chemicals were purchased from BDH (Kilsyth, Victoria, Australia) unless otherwise specified. Rat tail type I collagen (>99% purity; Collaborative Research, Waltham, MA) gels were prepared resuspended in serum-free α-MEM at a concentration of 25 μg/cm2, as described previously (7Traianedes K. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Human fibronectin (99% purity), murine laminin (>94%), and human vitronectin (Collaborative Research) were used at concentrations of 1, 1, and 0.1 μg/cm2, respectively, resuspended in serum-free α-MEM supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (to block nonspecific binding sites) to coat tissue culture dishes. The concentrations used were in the range recommended by the manufacturer. Isolation of RNA from cells grown on type I collagen required matrix dissolution, which was achieved using 0.05% (w/v) collagenase (Worthington) in phosphate-buffered saline at 37°C for 20-30 min as described previously(7Traianedes K. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured onto 170 cm2 plastic tissue culture dishes (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) that were either uncoated or coated with matrix. Cells were plated at the appropriate density to reach confluence at the time of RNA harvesting and grown in the presence or absence of 1 μM RA for 1, 2, 6, 8, and 24 h. RA was added at the time of subculture, and in the presence of fetal bovine serum, almost all cells adhered to either plastic or collagen within 1 h. Total RNA was extracted using guanidinium hydrochloride as described (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, 20 μg of total RNA was loaded per lane of 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nylon filters (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) following electrophoresis(21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.45Google Scholar). Complementary DNA (cDNA) probes were nick-translated with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) to a specific activity of 1 × 109 dpm/μg DNA, according to the manufacturer's specifications (Boehringer Mannheim, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Specifically bound probe was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Complementary DNA probes used were rat osteopontin (22Oldberg A. Franzén A. Heineg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8819-8823Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) and chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)(23Dugaiczyk A. Haron J.A. Stone E.M. Dennison O.E. Rothblum K.N. Schwartz R.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), the latter used to normalize mRNA species for loading variations. The method of differential display of mRNA used was essentially that described by Liang and Pardee(1992) (13Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar) and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology(1994)(24Liang P. Pardee A.B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 15.8.1-15.8.8Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA (6- and 24-h samples) was reverse-transcribed (RT) using 15 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in the presence of 2.5 μM of an anchored oligo(dT) primer T11AA (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTAA-3′), 8 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma), and 20 μM dNTP (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) at 42°C for 2 h. Samples were then heat-inactivated at 95°C for 10 min. PCR was performed using 80 ng of cDNA from the RT reaction, 2.5 μM T11AA, 1.25 μM of an arbitrarily designed 10-mer, DDMR6 (5′-GACCGCTTGT-3′), 2 μM dNTPs, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and incorporating 1 μCi of α-35S-dATP (Amersham). Of a number of thermostable polymerases evaluated, Boehringer Taq resulted in reproducible displays with the least background contamination. The PCR cycling conditions were: 94°C for 30 s, 42°C for 60 s, 72°C for 30 s, for 40 cycles followed by 5-min elongation time at 72°C. Samples were resolved on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, the gel dried, and bands visualized by autoradiography using Kodak AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Bands of interest were excised and placed in 100 μl of sterilized distilled water, allowed to rehydrate for 10 min, and DNA eluted from the gel by boiling for 15 min. A 20-μl aliquot was removed for subsequent amplification by two rounds of the same PCR reaction conditions but without α-35S-dATP. Enzyme, dNTP and buffer was re-supplemented prior to the second round of PCR. PCR products resolved on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel were subsequently extracted using Qiaex DNA purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), and PCR products were cloned into pCRScript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). DNA sequence analysis from both strands (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar) was performed using the Sequenase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequences were then compared with sequences in the GenBank™ data bank. Oligonucleotides specific to the 267 bp sequence of rat SRP54 (Fig. 1B) were synthesized (5′-540F: 5′-CTTGTAGACCCTGAGTTAAAG-3′ and 3′-540B: 5′-AGCTGGTCAAAAGCTCCTGCTC-3′) (shown in Fig. 1B) and subsequently used for semi-quantitative RT-PCR. A 32P-labeled internal oligonucleotide was used to verify PCR products (internal probe: 5′-GGAGTGGTAAAACAACAACGTG-3′) (shown in Fig. 1B). RT-PCR was performed on 5 μg of total RNA isolated from cells plated onto plastic or collagen for the times indicated above. For RT, oligo(dT) (Promega) was used as the primer and the same conditions as described above with the exception that 1 mM dNTP was employed. PCR of 80 ng of RT-RNA was performed using 2.5 μM of each primer in the presence of 0.1 mM dNTP. Amplification of a 415-bp fragment of rat GAPDH was performed to enable semi-quantitative normalization using oligonucleotides: 5′ GAPDH-5 (5′-AACGGATACATTGGGGGTAG-3′) and 3′ GAPDH-4 (5′-CATGGAGAAGGCTGGGGCTC-3′), and products were verified with an internal sense strand oligonucleotide, GAPDH-1 (5′-GCTGTGGGCAAGGTCATCCCC-3′)(26Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverley, CA) incorporating [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham). All oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer model 381A (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Inc. Division, Foster City, CA). To assess optimal cycle number for SRP54 primer pairs (540F and 540B), PCR saturation analysis was performed. Cycle number corresponding to the exponential phase of the reaction (not shown) was determined to be 25 cycles at 60°C annealing temperature. For rat-specific GAPDH primers, optimal product yield was obtained at 20 cycles at 55°C annealing temperature. For determination of the half-life of SRP54 mRNA, UMR201 cells were grown on plastic or collagen for 48 h, then exposed to the inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimadazole; Sigma) at a concentration of 25 μg/ml. RNA was then extracted from cultures at timed intervals for up to 24 h. In order to identify genes potentially regulated by cell-matrix interactions, the technique of dd-PCR was used to compare RNA derived from UMR201 preosteoblastic cells grown on a gel of rat tail type I collagen and compared with RNA derived from cells plated onto tissue culture plastic. Comparison was also made between RNA derived from cells that were either untreated or treated with RA, a known osteoblast differentiating agent(9Ng K.W. Gummer P.R. Michelangeli V.P. Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Cole W.G. Martin T.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To confirm differentially regulated bands, and to eliminate false positives, dd-PCR was performed at least twice on RNA isolated from experiments conducted months apart. To exclude the possibility of primer or genomic DNA contamination, PCR was performed on non-reverse-transcribed RNA samples and in the absence of template. No PCR products were detected after 40 cycles of the PCR reaction in these controls (not shown). Many PCR bands appeared differentially regulated between RNA samples from cells that were plated on plastic or collagen and that were either untreated or treated with RA (Fig. 1A). A number of these differentially expressed bands were excised from the sequencing gel, re-amplified, and cloned. Ten bands were subsequently sequenced, two of which were identical, two proved to be smaller fragments of longer sequences, indicating that the 5′-primer could hybridize to multiple sites within the same sequence, and six were unique sequences sharing no homology to sequences in the EMBL or GenBank™ data bases. One band of 267 bp (Fig. 1A) was consistently up-regulated in cells plated onto collagen and was determined to be the rat homolog of the 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle (SRP54). This sequence had a 95 and 94% homology, at the nucleotide level, with mouse (27Bernstein H.D. Poritz M.A. Strub K. Hoben P.J. Brenner S. Walter P. Nature. 1989; 340: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and canine (28Römisch K. Webb J. Herz J. Prehen S. Frank R. Vingron M. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1989; 340: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) SRP54, respectively, with only one amino acid difference in the 86-amino acid sequence (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the PCR fragment corresponding to the rat homologue of SRP54 resulted from a 5′-primer-5′-primer amplification and not a 5′-primer-3′-primer amplification. To confirm regulation of SRP54 in response to growth of UMR201 cells on collagen, specific oligonucleotides (540F and 540B) internal to the initial PCR fragment were synthesized corresponding to sequences near the termini of the rat PCR product (see Fig. 1B) and used for semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RNA was extracted at various times after UMR201 cells were plated onto plastic or collagen (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2A shows a Southern blot of the rat SRP54 PCR product verified using a rat-specific internal oligonucleotide as a probe. It is clear that even 1 h after subculturing cells onto collagen, SRP54 mRNA was up-regulated compared with cells on plastic, and this up-regulation was maintained for at least 48 h (not shown). It is of note that at 6 and 24 h, the up-regulation of SRP54 is consistent with that observed by differential display (Fig. 1A). A graphical representation of SRP54 signal normalized to GAPDH is shown in Fig. 2C. The rapid increase in SRP54 mRNA is suggestive of transcriptional activation by collagen. Growth of the UMR201 cells on collagen had no effect on the stability of SRP54 mRNA, which we determined to have an average half-life of 12.4 ± 0.9 h in cells grown on plastic or 14.4 ± 1.4 h in cells grown on collagen (S.E., n = 3). These results support the notion that collagen induces transcriptional activation of SRP54. Since SRP54 is involved in the protein secretory pathway, it was of interest to determine whether up-regulation of a known secreted protein paralleled the increase in SRP54. We have previously shown that osteopontin mRNA was up-regulated in UMR201 cells plated onto collagen for 24 h(7Traianedes K. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore measured OP mRNA levels over the time course period described above for SRP54. The same RNA samples for the experiment of Fig. 2were subjected to Northern blot analysis using a rat osteopontin cDNA probe. Fig. 2B shows that osteopontin mRNA, like that of SRP54, was up-regulated by 1 h after plating cells onto collagen, and this up-regulation was also maintained over the experimental period. A graphical representation of OP mRNA normalized to GAPDH levels is shown in Fig. 2C. Quantification of SRP54 and OP mRNA levels showed that both these species were up-regulated in cells plated onto collagen compared with cells on plastic. SRP54 mRNA remained 2-4-fold higher in cells on collagen compared with cells plated onto plastic, whereas OP mRNA in cells on collagen accumulated over the same period and at 24 h was 6-fold above levels in cells on plastic. To determine whether the induction of SRP54 mRNA was specific to collagen, UMR201 cells were plated on several non-collagenous matrices containing various cell-binding motifs, including the RGD sequence. In UMR201 cells plated onto fibronectin, laminin, or vitronectin, expression of neither SRP54 nor OP mRNA was regulated differently from cells on plastic (not shown). This suggests that the presence of an RGD motif in the exogenous substrate cannot alone account for the above observations. The technique of differential display of mRNA, or mRNA fingerprinting, is a powerful tool for comparing the abundance of mRNA species between RNA populations. Here we have shown that this technique was valuable in identifying mRNA species that were regulated in preosteoblastic cells when grown in contact with a physiological substratum. We have previously demonstrated the regulation of gene expression of known osteoblastic markers of differentiation when UMR201 cells were plated on collagen or matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane preparation(7Traianedes K. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A number of regulated mRNA species were identified using this procedure, some of which had no corresponding sequence recorded in the EMBL or GenBank™ data banks. This may have been the result of amplified sequences being confined mainly to the 3′-untranslated region or they might in fact represent cDNA species for novel mRNA transcripts. One mRNA species was of particular interest, since it was consistently up-regulated in cells on collagen. Sequence analysis identified this mRNA as the rat homologue of SRP54. The sequence obtained was the result of the 5′-primer acting as both sense and antisense primer, without the involvement of the anchored 3′-primer, fortuitously resulting in a sequence of the coding region being obtained. Regulation of SRP54 mRNA species has not been reported previously. Although the mRNA species was identified in preosteoblast-like cells, this protein is ubiquitous and has been identified in mammals(27Bernstein H.D. Poritz M.A. Strub K. Hoben P.J. Brenner S. Walter P. Nature. 1989; 340: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 28Römisch K. Webb J. Herz J. Prehen S. Frank R. Vingron M. Dobberstein B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22175-22180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of this species may be related to the differentiated state of the cell and its synthetic activity. It is likely that cells actively involved, for example, in organogenesis or repair require up-regulation of components of the synthetic machinery, whereas quiescent cells could down-regulate the expression of these components. Plating of UMR201 cells onto collagen appears to favor a more differentiated state of these cells when compared with cells on plastic(7Traianedes K. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Osteopontin is a known secreted protein of osteoblasts, and the markedly increased expression of this mRNA species may require up-regulation of many components of the protein secretory pathway, including SRP54, to accommodate the throughput of mRNA transcripts of proteins destined for secretion. Thus, cells may require a certain level of SRP54 protein expression to accommodate increased mRNA translation of secreted proteins. This may explain the expression profile found in the present study where SRP54 mRNA expression was rapidly increased, perhaps until a sustainable level of SRP54 protein was attained, followed by reduced steady-state mRNA levels thereafter. The rapid and concordant increase in SRP54 mRNA and OP mRNA after UMR201 cells were plated on to collagen would imply that the matrix evokes downstream signaling pathways to induce transcriptional activation of these genes. The inability of other RGD-containing peptides, such as fibronectin, laminin, or vitronectin, to mimic the induction of mRNA suggests that the presence of an RGD sequence alone is insufficient to elicit such a response. Thus, the collagen-induced activation of these genes may occur via an RGD-independent integrin interaction. It will be intriguing to investigate the signaling pathways that mediate these responses as well as identifying other secreted proteins or other components of the protein secretory pathway where expression is regulated by physiological substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1522642773,"The growth of CG-1 human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line and five of its randomly selected, single cell-derived subline cells is inhibited by bFGF in an autocrine and paracrine manner. In contrast, aFGF, which has a 55% homology in amino acid sequence with bFGF, stimulates cell growth. Basic FGF binds to specific cell surface high-affinity receptor sites with an apparent Kd of 105 pM. Of the two lines examined, the high-affinity binding sites for bFGF are calculated to be 1200 and 2600 per cell. The biological effect of bFGF is conveyed through its binding to the high-affinity receptor sites and the binding is dependent on the presence of cell surface heparin-like molecules, as treatment of cells with heparitinase or sodium chlorate abolishes high-affinity binding and growth inhibition. In contrast, similar treatment has no obvious effect on the growth-stimulatory effect of aFGF. Experimental results are also presented showing that the growth inhibition by bFGF is mediated through type I FGF receptors. These results suggest that bFGF and aFGF act via distinct receptor types to oppositely regulate the growth of CG-1 and subline cells."
