https://openalex.org/W2016646037,"Theoretical work on the magnetohydrodynamics of the earth's liquid core indicates (a) that horizontal variations in the properties of the core-mantle interface that would escape detection by modern seismological methods might nevertheless produce measurable geomagnetic effects; (b) that the rate of drift, relative to the earth's surface, of nonaxisymmetric features of the main geomagnetic field might be much faster than the average zonal speed of hydrodynamic motion of core material relative to the surrounding mantle; and (c) why magnetic astronomical bodies usually rotate. Among the consequences of (a) and (b) are the possibilities that (i) the shortest interval of time that can be resolved in paleomagnetic studies of the geocentric axial dipole component of the earth's magnetic field might be very much longer than the value often assumed by many paleomagnetic workers, (ii) reversals in sign of the geomagnetic dipole might be expected to show some degree of correlation with processes due to motions in the mantle (for example, tectonic activity, polar wandering), and (iii) variations in the length of the day that have hitherto been tentatively attributed to core motions may be due to some other cause."

After 7 days' growth as much as 31 percent of the silicon, 11 percent of the aluminum, 64 percent of the iron, and 59 percent of the magnesium in some of the rocks were solubilized, and a number of rocks showed altered infrared absorption in the silicon-oxygen vibration region."
https://openalex.org/W2059617045,"Mineralogical and chemical analyses performed on 67 ferromanganese nodules from widely varying locations and depths within the marine environment indicate that the minor element composition is controlled by the mineralogy, and that the formation of the mineral phases is depth dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2025052661,"An improved solution for the gravity field shows ocean rises, as well as trench and island arcs, as mass excesses. Ocean basins, areas of recent glaciation, and the Asian portion of the Alpide belt are mass deficiencies. Most features appear interpretable as varying behavior of the lithosphere in response to asthenospheric flow."
https://openalex.org/W1545387170,"The results have shown that selective excitation obtained with a tunable monochromatic laser is a useful technique for studying photochemical and energy transfer processes. A new phenomenon in the photochemistry of bromine was observed, in which bound excited molecules, and not atoms, were formed in the primary process. The mechanism of the subsequent reaction consists of collisional dissociation of the excited molecules into atoms, which then initiated free-radical chains. A quantitative estimate of the collisional electronic relaxation rate for excited bromine molecules was obtained, and a new upper limit to the continuous absorption strength at 14,400 cm(-1) was determined."

The juxtaposition of this sector of Antarctica with Africa in the Dietz and Sproll continental drift reconstruction results in a possible geochronologic fit of the Princess Martha Coast of Antarctica with a covered possible notheastern extension of the African Swaziland Shield, which contains granitic rocks that are also 3 billion years old."

https://openalex.org/W2067782624,"Scanning electron microscopic studies have revealed the configurations of the growth surfaces of scleractinian coral exoskeletons. Skeletal surfaces exhibit profuse growths of minute elongate aragonite crystals which, on basal and mural surfaces, are punctuated by scars. It is suggested that these scars are sites of attachment for the specialized processes that connect the living tissues of polyps to the nonliving skeleton. Patterns formed by the attachment scars are taxonomically significant."
https://openalex.org/W2078316237,"The apparent dissociation constants of carbonic and boric acids were determined for pressures up to 654 atmospheres in seawater of 34.8 per mille salinity at 22 degrees C. Our values for the ratios of the apparent dissociation constants at 654 atmospheres to the constants at 1 atmosphere are 1.84 1.48, and 1.94 for K'(1), K'(2), and K'(B), respectively. At this pressure the commonly accepted values of Buch and Gripenberg for these ratios are 2.03 and 1.30 for K'(1) and K'(2), respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1989849638,"Compound 4-n-butyl-1,2,4-triazole was demonstrated as an enduring and selective systemic fungicide for the control of wheat leaf rust by foliar and soil applications. Among several species of rust fungi treated, only wheat leaf rust (Puccinia recondita Rob.) was controlled. Wheat stem rust, for example, was unaffected by either soil or foliar applications."
https://openalex.org/W2054667095,"Among the 50,000 tektites collected over an 8-year period as part of a representative collection of the indochinities in an area near Dalat, South Vietnam, several individual ones have been found that show evidence of having been internally plastic after surface sculpturing was essentially completed. Two drops, which were bent after having formed a thin exterior skin or crust, exhibit surface breaks and stretching of their plastic interiors within the breaks. The lack of deep sculpturing in this interior stretched area, coupled with twisting within the break on one of them, indicates that the surface features on these tektites were formed in the atmosphere and not by etching by soil acids, as had been widely believed."
https://openalex.org/W2013108484,"GOPEB based upon known mesons have been found which realistically describe a massive accumulation of the experimental nuclear data up to 400 Mev. The N-N potential according to these models consists primarily of weak residual central terms surviving the cancellation of large repulsive and attractive vector and scalar static components; relativistic interactions arising from the exchange of pseudoscalar, vector, and scalar mesons and dipole type terms arising from the rho meson. The major dynamic terms are direct analogs of magnetic interactions illustrated in Fig. 1. Allowance must be made for the effective dependence of the coupling constants upon spin and isospin states. The nucleons are distributed sources which give rise to nonsingular generalized Yukawa functions in N-N potentials."

https://openalex.org/W2059517253,"An inorganic liquid photovoltaic cell is described. The cell is based on the reaction 2Mo(4+) <--> Mo(5+) + Mo(3+), with pentavalent molybdenum formed in the illuminated half-cell and trivalent molybdenum formed in the dark half-cell. In the photochemical reaction pentavalent molybdenum precipitates. Consequently, the cell has the capability of storing energy."

https://openalex.org/W2012756467,"Science and technology are themselves a part of our modern culture. They contribute to the arts, furnish new media for human expression, provide better and new musical instruments and improved acoustics for enriched enjoyment of them, and give the artist new materials and techniques for his work. They enrich the humanities in furnishing man with a broader basis for understanding himself, his potentialities, and his place in nature. The historian has a better approach to his subject because of scientific methodology. The archeologist has a surer grasp on temporal relationships because of the tools that physics and chemistry give him for dating materials and identifying their sources. Slowly, an entire world absorbs the increased understanding of man and nature that science generates, and reflects that understanding in its literature, its social, political, and economic institutions, and its application to human daily living. Today, much of the world's population is aware of the world as a body of a solar system in a galaxy among millions of other galaxies. These people can conceive of man in a historical and cosmological perspective that did not exist in centuries past. As this understanding and these concepts spread to more and more of the world's people, it may be hoped that this common bond of understanding will not only give increased motivation to solve peaceably the problems that beset the world, but will also provide increased means for doing so."

https://openalex.org/W2027142016,"A group of peridotites in southwestern Oregon contains high-pressure mineral assemblages reflecting recrystallization at high temperatures (1100 degrees to 1200 degrees C) over a range of pressure decreasing from 19 to 5 kilobars. It is proposed that the peridotites represent upper-mantle material brought from depth along the ancestral Gorda-Juan de Fuca ridge system, transported eastward by the spreading Gorda lithosphere plate, and then emplaced by thrust-faulting in the western margin of the Cordillera during late Mesozoic time."
