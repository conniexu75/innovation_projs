https://openalex.org/W1996464851,"In a longitudinal study of HIV seropositive patients, there were fluctuations in the specificity of cytotoxic T cells for the virus. This was matched by variability in proviral gag DNA epitope sequences in the lymphocytes of these patients. Some of these viral variants are not recognized by autologous T cells. Accumulation of such mutations in T-cell antigenic targets would provide a mechanism for immune escape."
https://openalex.org/W1986319478,"L1 elements are highly repeated mammalian DNA sequences whose structure suggests dispersal by retrotransposition. A consensus L1 element encodes a protein with sequence similarity to known reverse transcriptases. The second open reading frame from the human L1 element L1.2A was expressed as a fusion protein targeted to Ty1 virus-like particles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and shown to have reverse transcriptase activity. This activity was eliminated by a missense mutation in the highly conserved amino acid motif Y/F-X-D-D. Thus, L1 represents a potential source of the reverse transcriptase activity necessary for dispersion of the many classes of mammalian retroelements."
https://openalex.org/W2075257287,"CYSTIC fibrosis is associated with a defect in epithelial chloride ion transport (reviewed in refs 1, 2) which is caused by mutations in a membrane protein called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)3. Heterologous expression of CFTR produces cyclicAMP-sensitive Cl--channel activity4–7.Deletion of phenylalanine at amino-acid position 508 in CFTR (ΔF508 CFTR) is the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis8. It has been proposed that this mutation prevents glycoprotein maturation and its transport to its normal cellular location9. We have expressed both CFTR and ΔF508 CFTR in Vero cells using recombinant vaccinia virus. Although far less ΔF508 CFTR reached the plasma membrane than normal CFTR, sufficient ΔF508 CFTR was expressed at the plasma membrane to permit functional analysis. ΔF508 CFTR expression induced a reduced activity of the cAMP-activated Cl- channel, with conductance, anion selectivity and open-time kinetics similar to those of CFTR, but with much greater closed times, resulting in a large decrease of open probability. The ΔF508 mutation thus seems to have two major consequences, an abnormal translocation of the CFTR protein which limits membrane insertion, and an abnormal function in mediating Cl- transport."

The x-ray structure of this porin has revealed details of its shape, the residue distributions within the pore and at the membrane-facing surface, and the location of calcium sites. The electrostatic potential has been calculated and related to function. Moreover, potential calculations were found to predict the Ca2+ sites."

https://openalex.org/W2013946123,"Calcium-dependent (C-type) animal lectins participate in many cell surface recognition events mediated by protein-carbohydrate interactions. The C-type lectin family includes cell adhesion molecules, endocytic receptors, and extracellular matrix proteins. Mammalian mannose-binding proteins are C-type lectins that function in antibody-independent host defense against pathogens. The crystal structure of the carbohydrate-recognition domain of a rat mannose-binding protein, determined as the holmium-substituted complex by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing, reveals an unusual fold consisting of two distinct regions, one of which contains extensive nonregular secondary structure stabilized by two holmium ions. The structure explains the conservation of 32 residues in all C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains, suggesting that the fold seen here is common to these domains. The strong anomalous scattering observed at the Ho LIII edge demonstrates that traditional heavy atom complexes will be generally amenable to the MAD phasing method."
https://openalex.org/W1553517909,"The functions of src family protein-tyrosine kinases are thought to be regulated negatively by the phosphorylation of highly conserved tyrosine residues close to their carboxyl termini. Recently we have purified and cloned a protein-tyrosine kinase (designated as CSK) that can specifically phosphorylate the negative regulatory site of p60c-src. To elucidate the relationship between CSK and other types of src family kinases, we investigated the tissue distribution of CSK and examined whether CSK could phosphorylate the negative regulatory sites of src family kinases other than p60c-src. Western blot analysis indicated that CSK was enriched at the highest level in lymphoid tissues in which the expression of p60c-src is considerably lower than those of other types of src family kinases. CSK phosphorylated p56lyn and p59fyn, which are known to be expressed in lymphoid tissues at a relatively high level. The putative regulatory site, tyrosine 508, was found to be essential for phosphorylation in p56lyn, and the kinase activities of these src family kinases were repressed by phosphorylation with CSK. These findings raise the possibility that CSK might act as a universal regulator for src family kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1524149821,"The intergenic region between the mouse alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) and beta-MHC genes was analyzed in terms of its ability to drive gene expression in transgenic mice. Earlier, we reported that the entire intergenic region was sufficient to direct expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene in a tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific manner. Additional transgenic lines have been generated which include two deletions. The first deletion, alpha-3, which lacks the distal 2.5 kilobase pairs of the upstream region, is competent to direct tissue- and developmental-specific expression of the transgene. A larger deletion, in which only 138 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site remain, shows no chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in either muscle or non-muscle tissue. Tissue surveys of transgene expression indicated low levels of activity in the lung, and analyses via the polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of the endogenous alpha-MHC gene transcripts in this tissue. Subsequently, an alpha-MHC gene-specific riboprobe was used to detect the cognate transcripts in lung sections by in situ hybridization. The data show that, in the lung, the transcripts are localized to the thick intimal wall of the veins and venules."

An animal model for FH, the Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic rabbit, was used to develop an approach for liver-directed gene therapy based on transplantation of autologous hepatocytes that were genetically corrected ex vivo with recombinant retroviruses. Animals transplanted with LDLR-transduced autologous hepatocytes demonstrated a 30 to 50 percent decrease in total serum cholesterol that persisted for the duration of the experiment (122 days). Recombinant-derived LDLR RNA was harvested from tissues with no diminution for up to 6.5 months after transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1503746610,"The rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line differentiates into a sympathetic neuronal phenotype upon treatment with either nerve growth factor (NGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor. The alkaloid-like compound K-252a has been demonstrated to be a specific inhibitor of NGF-induced biological responses in PC12 cells (Koizumi, S., Contreras, M. L., Matsuda, Y., Hama, T., Lazarovici, P., and Guroff, G. (1988) J. Neurosci. Res. 8, 715-721). NGF interacts with the protein product of the proto-oncogene trk and rapidly stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of both p140prototrk and a number of cellular substrates. Here we show that these phosphorylation events are directly inhibited in PC12 cells by K252a in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the site of action of this inhibitor is at the NGF receptor level. K-252a inhibits p140prototrk activity in vitro, demonstrating that K-252a has a direct effect on the p140prototrk tyrosine kinase. Though many of the biochemical responses to NGF in PC12 cells are mimicked by basic fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor, K-252a has no effect on the action of these growth factors in PC12 cells, demonstrating that the initial biological events initiated by NGF are distinctive during neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2000853989,"Long-term depression (LTD) in the intact cerebellum is a decrease in the efficacy of the parallel fiber-Purkinje neuron synapse induced by coactivation of climbing fiber and parallel fiber inputs. In cultured Purkinje neurons, a similar depression can be induced by iontophoretic glutamate pulses and Purkinje neuron depolarization. This form of LTD is expressed as a depression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA)-mediated current, and its induction is dependent on activation of metabotropic quisqualate receptors. The effect of inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) on LTD induction was studied. Inhibitors of PKC blocked LTD induction, while phorbol-12,13-diacetate (PDA), a PKC activator, mimicked LTD. These results suggest that PKC activation is necessary for the induction of cerebellar LTD."
https://openalex.org/W1981675681,"A transgenic mouse line containing a fos-lacZ fusion gene was derived in which beta-galactosidase activity identified cell populations expressing fos either constitutively or after stimulation. Seizures and light pulses induced nuclear lacZ activity in defined populations of neurons in vivo, and an array of neurotransmitters, including glutamate, induced the transgene in primary brain cultures. In unstimulated mice, the major sites of fos-lacZ expression were skin, hair follicle, and bone. fos-lacZ mice provide a new avenue for activity mapping studies based on gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2090138476,"Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) occurs in brain after ischemia and status epilepticus. We report that induction of the heat shock response in cortical cultures protects neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Cultures heated to 42.2 degrees C for 20 min showed an overall decrease in protein synthesis but an increase in the synthesis of approximately 72 and approximately 85 kd proteins and in the levels of HSP70 mRNA. Heat shock inhibited excitotoxicity in cells exposed to glutamate at 3 or 24 hr following heat exposure, but not when the interval between heat and glutamate exposure was shortened to 15 min or lengthened to 48 hr. Protection due to heat shock required new protein synthesis, since it did not occur when protein or RNA synthesis inhibitors were added. By ameliorating excitotoxic processes, HSPs may attenuate brain injury in certain pathologic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1557734333,"Rat pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) is an additional protein appearing in pancreatic juice after induction of prancreatic inflammation. Its messenger RNA was cloned and sequenced from pancreas. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that PAP was synthetized as a preprotein with, in its mature form, a predicted molecular weight of 16,630. A search in protein data bases revealed a marked homology with the carbohydrate binding region of animal lectins; no hemagglutination activity could be shown for PAP, but the protein induced extensive bacterial aggregation. In healthy rats, the very low level of PAP expression in pancreas could be increased up to 4-fold by physiological stimuli such as chronic hormonal or cholinergic stimulation of pancreatic secretion and adaptation of rats to a carbohydrate-rich diet. By contrast, induction of acute experimental pancreatitis by retrograde injection of sodium taurocholate resulted in dramatic overexpression. Pancreatic concentration of PAP mRNA increased more than 300 x within 12 h whereas concentrations of mRNAs encoding major secretory proteins such as amylase decreased. PAP overexpression persisted during the 2 days of the acute phase and then returned to the control level during pancreatic recovery. PAP mRNA could not be evidenced in liver, stomach, salivary glands, brain, kidney, or testis. Its pattern of expression during severe pancreatic aggression suggests that it might be a stress protein involved in the control of bacterial proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W1522920418,"The participation of phagosomes in interorganellar protein and membrane exchange is important to the maturation of phagosomes into phagolysosomes. To investigate this process, we have developed an assay to measure protein transport from phagosomes to other vesicle populations. J774-E clone macrophages phagocytosed 125I-anti-dinitrophenol IgG-coated Staphylococcus aureus for 3 min followed by chase for intervals of 0-30 min. Following cell fractionation, the intracellular distribution of radioiodinated protein was assayed. We observed a time-dependent increase radioiodinated protein in a non-phagosome vesicle fraction which displayed endosome characteristics. Concomitantly, radioiodinated protein within phagosomes decreased over the chase period. As assessed via Percoll density gradient fractionation, the phagocytosed radioiodinated protein migrated to both heavy (lysosome density) and light (endosome density) vesicle populations. Characterization of the fusogenic properties of the transport vesicles demonstrated that they are capable of in vitro fusion with early endosomes. Furthermore, this fusion event shares many of the biochemical requirements identified for phagosome-endosome and endosome-endosome fusion. Morphological analysis of phagosome maturation provides additional evidence for phagosome to endosome transport. These results suggest phagocytosed material is transferred from phagosomes to endosomes and then recycled out of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1943108778,"Abstract Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is a characteristic constituent of osteoclasts and some mononuclear preosteoclasts and, therefore, used as a histochemical and biochemical marker for osteoclasts and bone resorption. We now report the isolation of a 1397-base pair (bp) full-length TRAP/tartrate-resistant acid ATPase (TrATPase) cDNA clone from a neonatal rat calvaria lambda gt11 cDNA library. The cDNA clone consists of a 92-bp untranslated 5'-flank, an open reading frame of 981 bp and a 324-bp untranslated 3'-poly(A)-containing region. The deduced protein sequence of 327 amino acids contains a putative cleavable signal sequence of 21 amino acids. The mature polypeptide of 306 amino acids has a calculated Mr of 34,350 Da and a pI of 9.18, and it contains two potential N-glycosylation sites and the lysosomal targeting sequence DKRFQ. At the protein level, the sequence displays 89-94% homology to TRAP enzymes from human placenta, beef spleen, and uteroferrin and identity to the N terminus of purified rat bone TRAP/TrATPase. An N-terminal amino acid segment is strikingly homologous to the corresponding region in lysosomal and prostatic acid phosphatases. The cDNA recognized a 1.5-kilobase mRNA in long bones and calvaria, and in vitro translation using, as template, mRNA transcribed from the full-length insert yielded an immunoprecipitated product of 34 kDa. In neonatal rats, TRAP/TrATPase mRNA was highly expressed in skeletal tissues, with much lower (less than 10%) levels detected in spleen, thymus, liver, skin, brain, kidney, brain, lung, and heart. In situ hybridization demonstrated specific labeling of osteoclasts at endostal surfaces and bone trabeculae of long bones. Thus, despite the apparent similarity of this osteoclastic TRAP/TrATPase with type 5, tartrate-resistant and purple, acid phosphatases expressed in other mammalian tissues, this gene appears to be preferentially expressed at skeletal sites."
https://openalex.org/W2049269457,"To gain insight into how laminin promotes neurite growth, high resolution video microscopy was used to determine the rapid effects of laminin on growth cone structure. Sympathetic growth cones in serum-free medium on polylysine substrate displayed extensive motility and protrusive activity and often had large lamellipodia. However, their neurites grew slowly because membranous organelles from the central region advanced into the lamellipodium only slowly. Acute addition of laminin accelerated growth severalfold and had visible effects on the growth cone within minutes. Laminin dramatically accelerated the advance of membranous organelles, which, with microtubules, rapidly filled the lamellipodium. Retraction of individual protrusions (filopodia and veils) was rapidly reduced. These effects of laminin are important in accelerating growth and suggest a mechanism for pathway selection by growing neurites."
https://openalex.org/W1597544092,"To identify the transcription regulatory elements of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, DNA fragments located in the 5‘-upstream region were fused with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and transfected into various cell lines to test for promoter activity. The results of these studies suggested that there were at least two positive and one negative cisacting elements involved in CFTR transcription initiation. One of them was a proximal, positive element delimited by the 5‘ deletion constructs -226 base parts upstream of the transcription start site. This minimal promoter sequence (-226 to +98) alone seemed to be sufficient to direct cell-specific CAT expression. The sequences immediately upstream of -227, on the other hand, appeared to contain a negative regulatory element; inclusion of this sequence with the proximal element (e.g. a construct containing sequences -345 to +98) rendered the CFTR promoter inactive. This negative regulatory element could also suppress the activity of a heterologous promoter. In addition, the DNA transfection study suggested the existence of another positive regulatory element outside the CFTR promoter region examined, as the inability of this region (e.g. -658 to +98) to function in a CAT assay could be overcome by the presence of a viral enhancer element."
https://openalex.org/W2141710406,"We have generated a polyclonal antibody against myosin II from a neuronally derived cell line in order to assess potential roles for myosin II in growth cone movement and synaptic transmission. The distribution of neuronal myosin II, in isolated cells as well as in tissues of the adult rat brain and spinal cord, was examined at the light microscopic and ultrastructural levels. In isolated neuroblastoma cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons, myosin II was found at the leading edge of growth cones, within neuritic processes and cell soma, and adjacent to the plasma membrane. The subcellular distribution of myosin II overlapped significantly with that of both actin and single-headed myosin I. These results implicate both myosin I and myosin II as molecular motors required for neurite elongation and growth cone motility. An exclusive postsynaptic distribution of myosin II in neurons of the mature central nervous system suggests that myosin II cannot play a role in the mobilization of synaptic vesicles, but could participate in synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1482183307,"The conductance properties of three members of the porin family which form channels across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria were compared. With their endogenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bound, the closely related porins F and C from Escherichia coli reveal significantly different conductance steps and closing potentials, with values of 0.82 nS (nanosiemens) and 89 mV for F-type channels, and 0.49 nS and 158 mV for C-type pores (1 M NaCl), respectively. On the basis of their closing potentials, the two channel types can be distinguished unequivocally. If reconstituted in asolectin and extraneous LPS, porin C forms F-type in addition to C-type channels. Substitution of asolectin by mitochondrial lipids yields the native C-type pores only. Both channel types can be induced to assume the mutually other channel configuration by variation of ionic strength. A multiplicity of channel subtypes is observed by variation of the pH of the medium. The three channels within a trimer are, however, consistently of the same type. Since structural studies have revealed a single channel per monomer, the several conductance steps observed are likely to reflect distinct configurations of the same channel. Best channel recoveries were observed if endogenous LPS remained associated to porin during purification. Significant yields could nevertheless be obtained also if LPS was removed from porin and replaced with various precursors or chemically synthesized analogues. As function requires the presence of glycolipids, yet crystallization is perturbed by heterodisperse endogenous LPS, the smallest monodisperse analogues yielding good channel recovery were determined. The minimal synthetic moiety is a monoglucosaminetetraacyl compound. The characteristics of porin B from E. coli BE are shown to be indistinguishable from those of porin F. The conductance properties of this porin, refolded from random coil configuration, are indistinguishable from those exhibited by native protein. The formation of channels is thus encoded by the sequence of the mature polypeptide alone."
https://openalex.org/W1521893515,"We have isolated overlapping cDNA clones from human and hamster libraries which comprise the entire coding sequences for the prepro-alpha 1(V) collagen chains of both species. The translated polypeptide has a signal peptide of 36 amino acids, a central triple helical domain of 338 uninterrupted Gly-X-Y triplets, and 266 amino acids which comprise the C-telopeptide and propeptide. The N-propeptide and telopeptide are comprised of 522 residues in humans and 524 residues in hamsters. The cDNA-derived pro-alpha 1(V) amino acid sequences exhibit a variety of structural features characteristic of fibrillar collagens. Pro-alpha 1(V) is found to be unique among fibrillar collagen chains, however, in lacking potential cross-linking lysyl residues in either telopeptide, and in possessing potential N-asparaginyl-linked carbohydrate attachment sites in its N-propeptide. Of particular interest is the strong homology found between the pro-alpha 1(V) and pro-alpha 1(XI) collagen chains in most domains, with the notable exception of a subdomain in the globular region of the N-propeptide. RNase protection analysis of RNA with a variety of pro-alpha 1(V) cDNA-derived riboprobes indicates a broad distribution of expression of the pro-alpha 1(V) chain in tissues and suggests that transcripts encoding the pro-alpha 1(V) chain and the putative pro-alpha 1'(V) chain are not products of the same gene."
https://openalex.org/W1569934993,"Apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, the major apoprotein of human high density lipoprotein, is a vital cofactor for lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), the plasma enzyme responsible for esterification of free cholesterol associated with high density lipoprotein. This esterification is an important component of the reverse cholesterol transport process. An immunochemical approach was used to test the hypothesis that a discrete region of apoA-I was important for LCAT activation. Three human apoA-I-specific monoclonal antibodies were found to inhibit LCAT activation in vitro in a manner directly proportional to their ability to bind to apoA-I-proteoliposomes in fluid phase immunoassays. This relationship was not observed with another four apoA-I-specific antibodies that also were able to bind to the apoA-I proteoliposomes. The use of synthetic peptides representing short amino acid sequences of the apoA-I molecule facilitated the identification of discrete but overlapping apoA-I epitopes for those antibodies that interfered with LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification. These epitopes spanned amino acid residues 95-121 of mature apoA-I. Therefore, this region is most likely involved in the activation of LCAT by apoA-I."
https://openalex.org/W1639706240,"Treatment of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells with the mitogenic peptides bombesin, vasopressin, endothelin/vasoactive intestinal contractor (VIC), and bradykinin strikingly increased the initial rate of tyrosine phosphorylation measured in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of a major band of Mr 115,000 (p115) and two minor components of Mr 90,000 and 75,000. Neuropeptides increased the labeling of p115 within seconds and with great potency; half-maximum concentrations were 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 nM for bombesin, vasopressin, and VIC, respectively. Immunoblotting and peptide mapping showed that the p115 band phosphorylated in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates is identical to a major Mr 115,000 substrate for neuropeptide-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in intact Swiss 3T3 cells. Furthermore, bombesin, vasopressin, and VIC markedly increased the rate of phosphorylation of Raytide, a broad specificity tyrosine kinase peptide substrate, by decreasing (8 +/- 1.3-fold) the apparent Km of the kinase for the substrate. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 had a weaker effect on tyrosine protein kinase activity in immune complexes compared with bombesin. Furthermore, down-regulation of protein kinase C blocked the small effect of phorbol esters but did not impair bombesin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity. These results provide direct evidence for neuropeptide activation of a tyrosine kinase in cell-free preparations and identify a novel event in the action of this class of growth factors in Swiss 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1502161210,"Lys-Bradykinin (BK), a mitogen for human foreskin fibroblasts (HSWP cells) (Owen, N. E., and Villereal, M. L. (1983) Cell 32, 979-985), elicits a rapid, transient elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in these cells. We have used image analysis of fura-2-loaded HSWP cells to examine the BK-induced [Ca2+]i changes in individual cells. BK-stimulated Ca2+ and release of intracellular Ca2+ stores can be distinguished by stimulating cells in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+, or by inhibiting Ca2+ with 5 mM NiCl2. BK-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores can be depleted by exposure of the cells to BK in Ca(2+)-free medium; refilling of the stores requires extracellular Ca2+. A component of BK-stimulated Ca2+ persists after removal of agonist, but inactivates with a t1/2 of approximately 5 min. Although previous studies have attributed the Ca2+ which persists after agonist removal to a Ca2+ entry pathway activated by the depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores, we find that a large component of this BK-stimulated Ca2+ is not due to capacitative Ca2+ since (1) ionomycin can deplete the BK-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores without appreciably stimulating Ca2+ and without inhibiting the BK-stimulated Ca2+ and (2) this Ca2+ pathway inactivates at a time when the Ca2+ pools are still empty and a capacitance pathway should still be open. On the other hand, refilling of the intracellular Ca2+ stores can occur after the noncapacitative Ca2+ component has inactivated or when it is inhibited by Ni2+; in these cases refilling occurs without a detectable elevation of [Ca2+]i suggesting that refilling of internal Ca2+ pools might occur by a capacitative route."
https://openalex.org/W1560485624,"The expression of cyclooxygenase (EC 1.14.99.1, Cox), a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of inflammatory prostanoids, is regulated by growth factors and cytokines. We have shown previously that the cytokine interleukin-1, an inhibitor of endothelial growth in vitro and stimulator of prostacyclin production, induces the expression of the 3-kilobase Cox transcript in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In contrast, the endothelial cell mitogen, heparin-binding (acidic fibroblast) growth factor-1 (HBGF-1) inhibits the synthesis of prostacyclin in HUVEC. In this report, we describe the effect of HBGF-1 on Cox mRNA expression in HUVEC. Cells cultured in the presence of HBGF-1 express diminished Cox mRNA levels whereas quiescent cells maintained in serum expressed a 7-fold higher level of the transcript for Cox. Concomitantly, the level of the Cox translation product and prostacyclin synthesis are also reduced by HBGF-1. Further, HBGF-1, in the presence of heparin, down-regulates the levels of the Cox transcript in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The onset of action of HBGF-1 is slow, requiring up to 24 h to depress the level of Cox mRNA. Lastly, the effective dose of HBGF-1 to depress Cox mRNA levels is similar to that required for mitogenesis, suggesting that cell proliferation may be required for the reduction of Cox expression in vitro. Thus, Cox may belong to a class of genes that are reversibly down-regulated during periods of endothelial cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1483945808,"We have previously demonstrated that the 73-kDa (A) subunit of the bovine coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase possesses a nucleotide binding site required for catalytic activity (Arai, H., Berne, M., Terres, G., Terres, H., Puopolo, K., and Forgac, M. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 6632-6638). Here we report the cDNA sequence of the coding region of the bovine brain A subunit. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with those previously reported for the A subunits of vacuolar ATPases from lower eukaryotes, plants, and archaebacteria reveals significant homology, especially in sequences implicated in nucleotide binding. The message encoding the bovine brain A subunit is relatively large, approximately 4.6 kilobases; Northern blotting of RNA isolated from rat brain and human brain tumor cells reveals a message of similar size. Northern analysis of several bovine tissues indicates that only one message for this subunit is expressed. Southern blot analysis of bovine genomic DNA indicates that the bovine A subunit is encoded by a single gene."
https://openalex.org/W1495040219,"We have examined the ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) using a natural sequence 83-nucleotide-long RNA template to which was hybridized a DNA oligomer. This substrate configuration allowed for the simultaneous electrophoretic resolution of 5'-, 3'-, and internally derived RNase H cleavage products. Assays performed in the presence of excess challenger RNA to sequester the RT permitted the analysis of products resulting from a single round of binding of RT to substrate. Substrate cleavage was highly sensitive to ionic strength, showing greatest activity at low KCl concentrations. The increase in cleavage correlated with an increase in the half-life of the enzyme on the RNA-DNA hybrid from approximately 31 s to 6.2 min at 80 and 5 mM KCl, respectively. Internally derived cleavage products generated in challenged reactions were primarily 2-9 nucleotides in length. These lengths indicate that the products were generated by an endo- rather than an exonuclease activity. The directionality and processivity of the endonuclease were also determined by examination of cleavage products from challenged reactions. Although the lengths of 5'-derived products markedly decreased with time, no change in the size distribution of 3'-derived products was observed, indicating that cleavage proceeded processively in the 3' to 5' direction. The 5'-derived products were shortened more in reactions performed under conditions allowing multiple versus single enzyme-binding events, suggesting that the endonuclease action of a single enzyme is not processive enough to generate the maximum possible amount of cleavage on each substrate. Therefore, HIV-RT displays a partially processive 3' to 5' endonuclease activity."
https://openalex.org/W1988243125,"Single-channel properties of glycine receptors have been characterized so far only in cultured neurons. To characterize the glycine receptor channels in situ, we applied the patch-clamp technique to spinal neurons in slice preparations. Glycine-gated, single-channel currents were recorded in outside-out patches excised from spinal neurons. In the falling phase of glycinergic inhibitory synaptic currents, single-channel currents were resolved as discrete steps. In both cases, the glycine-gated channels showed similar multiple conductance levels. These results suggest that the receptor channel properties are indistinguishable in the synaptic and extrasynaptic sites. We conclude that multiple conductance states of a receptor channel are the native feature of the glycine receptor in situ."

https://openalex.org/W2092490700,"To investigate the influence of inflammatory cytokines on the potential of peripheral nerves to regenerate, we analyzed the effect of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on the ability of immortalized Schwann cells to mediate outgrowth of neurites from primary DRG neurons. We found that IFNγ and TNF-α synergistically inhibited the neurite outgrowth-promoting properties of the Schwann cells by specifically downregulating myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) at the levels of mRNA and cell surface protein by approximately 60%. Antibodiesto MAG inhibited the outgrowth of neurites on Schwann cells to the same extent as treatment with the two cytokines. Since MAG appears to be involved in both neurite outgrowth and myelination, our findings may provide evidence for a mechanism, by which inflammatory cytokines interfere with Schwann cell-neuron interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1555043529,"The inactivation of the cytoplasmic domain of rat LAR, a receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase), by iodoacetate and not by iodoacetamide suggested that iodoacetate interacts in a highly selective manner with the enzyme. The data indicate that iodoacetate binds at the active site of the enzyme with a stoichiometry of 0.8 mol of iodoacetate bound per mol of rat LAR. A single [14C]iodoacetate-labeled peptide was isolated following endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of the radiolabeled PTPase. Sequence analysis of the active site labeled peptide demonstrates that Cys-1522 contains the radiolabel. This residue has been shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be essential for rat LAR activity (Pot, D. A., Woodford, T. A., Remboutsika, E., Haun, R. S., and Dixon, J. E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19688-19696). Iodoacetate reacts only with the first domain of this double domain PTPase. These results, for the first time, directly identify the highly reactive cysteine residue at the active site of a PTPase and highlight the ability of this residue to participate as a nucleophile in the hydrolysis of phosphate from tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1596448355,"Abstract The objective of this study was to characterize mechanisms which maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei. The identification of homeostatic pathways is required to understand signal transduction in these organisms. The fluorescent probes Fura-2, 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, and bisoxonal were used to measure intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), intracellular pH (pHi), and membrane potential, respectively. Homeostatic pathways maintained [Ca2+]i at 98 +/- 12 nM in the presence of 1.8 mM extracellular calcium despite a steady leak of calcium into the cell. The addition of 2.7 microM nigericin acidified the cytosol, depolarized the plasma membrane, and induced an approximate 3-fold increase in [Ca2+]i. The rise in [Ca2+]i could not be induced with valinomycin or gramicidin D under conditions where membrane depolarization occurred. By contrast, the proton ionophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, elevated [Ca2+]i in a manner that was not additive with nigericin. Changes in pHi appeared to regulate [Ca2+]i since: 1) stepwise addition of K+ to nigericin-treated cells generated and incremental increase in pHi and concomitant decrease in [Ca]i; 2) addition of serum to nigericin-treated cells allowed simultaneous recovery of pHi and [Ca2+]i; and 3) addition of NH4Cl to untreated cells resulted in a biphasic change in pHi with corresponding biphasic change in [Ca2+]i. The rise in [Ca2+]i was derived from an intracellular pool which was not dependent on functional cytochrome oxidase, mitochondrial alternative oxidase, or the F0F1-ATPase. These data demonstrate that large quantities of calcium are reversibly stored in a non-mitochondrial pH-sensitive intracellular pool in T. brucei. We conclude that changes in pHi can serve to trigger calcium signals in these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1597249881,"A complex of nucleic acid binding proteins (100, 35, and 25 kDa) was purified to apparent homogeneity from nuclear extracts of the murine plasmacytoma J558L. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the 25-kDa subunit enabled the isolation of a cDNA that encodes a 528-amino acid protein that is highly homologous to the human 62-kDa human polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) (Garcia-Blanco, M. A., Jamison, S. F., and Sharp, P. A. (1989) Genes & Dev. 3, 1874-1886; Gil, A., Sharp, P. A., Jamison, S. F., and Garcia-Blanco, M. A. (1991) Genes & Dev. 5, 1224-1236; Patton, J. G., Mayer, S. A., Tempst, P., and Nadal-Ginard, B. (1991) Genes & Dev. 5, 1237-1251). Sequence comparison programs suggested the presence of domains related to the RNA recognition motif found in other RNA-binding proteins, and deletion analysis revealed that the carboxyl-terminal 195 amino acids of the recombinant PTB was sufficient for specific binding to pre-mRNAs. Cross-linking experiments identified a 25-kDa protein in crude nuclear extracts of J558L cells that possessed the RNA binding properties of PTB, while a approximately 60-kDa protein is detected in other murine cell lines tested. Thus, the 25-kDa protein found in J558L is likely a proteolytic product of the murine polypyrimidine tract binding protein. A probe derived from the PTB cDNA detected a ubiquitous 3.3-kb mRNA in murine cell lines and a 3.6-kb mRNA in human lines. Southern blot analysis revealed three strongly hybridizing DNA fragments and several more weakly hybridizing bands in mouse, human, and yeast DNA. The role of PTB in pre-mRNA splicing is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1525142645,"Translation of the repZ gene encoding a DNA replication initiation protein of plasmid ColIb-P9 depends on not only the translation of a transcribed leader sequence (repY) but also the specific intergenic base pairing within RepZ mRNA between two short complementary sequences located in the repY and inc gene regions. In addition, repZ translation can be negatively regulated by Inc RNA, the product of the inc gene and a countertranscript to RepZ mRNA. Here we present evidence indicating that a stable secondary structure of RepZ mRNA, designated as structure III, sequesters one of the complementary sequences and the ribosome-binding site, thereby preventing repZ translation. When site-directed mutagenesis was used to destabilize structure III without changing the ribosome-binding site, a significant level of repZ expression was observed even in the absence of repY translation. Under these conditions, however, repZ expression could be substantially reduced by additional mutations that directly diminished the intergenic base pairing at the mRNA level between the two complementary sequences. These results indicate that repY translation is essential for the disruption of structure III by inducing the formation of a new secondary structure through the intergenic base pairing, and more importantly, that this new structure enhances repZ translation. We also found that the site of repY translation termination played a critical role in the intramolecular conformational alteration of structure III."
https://openalex.org/W1484658669,"We have used an in vitro system to characterize ribonuclease activities present in spinach chloroplasts. We show that 3' end maturation of petD mRNA, which encodes subunit IV of the cytochrome b6/f complex, is affected by a 33-kDa protein that binds to a hairpin structure at the 3' end of the mature mRNA. Binding of the 33-kDa protein to the petD hairpin structure decreases the efficiency of 3' end maturation, probably by impeding the progress of the processive 3'-5' exonuclease activity involved in chloroplast mRNA processing. A two-base mutation in the stem of the petD hairpin structure creates a novel recognition site for a ribonuclease which competes with the normal processing exonuclease activity. This mutation results in a very low 3' end processing efficiency for mutant petD transcripts, and instead generates a second processing product that lacks a complete hairpin structure. An endonuclease activity which is biochemically distinct from the previously characterized exonuclease activities has also been identified. This endonuclease activity is EDTA-insensitive, and cleaves petD RNA both at the termination codon and at the mature RNA 3' end. Cleavage of petD mRNA at the termination codon leads to rapid degradation of upstream RNA. The possible roles of these ribonuclease activities in chloroplast mRNA decay in vivo are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1551636118,"Previous studies in vitro on proteoglycan biosynthesis from our laboratory have shown that nucleotide sugar precursors of all the sugars of the linkage oligosaccharides (xylose, galactose, and glucuronic acid) and of the glycosaminoglycans (N-acetylglucosamine, N-galactosamine, and glucuronic acid) are transported by specific carriers into the lumen of Golgi vesicles. More recently, we also reported the reconstitution in phosphatidylcholine liposomes of detergent-solubilized Golgi membrane proteins containing transport activities of CMP-sialic acid and adenosine-3'-phosphate-5'-phosphosulfate. We have now completed the successful reconstitution into liposomes of the Golgi membrane transport activities of UDP-galactose, UDP-xylose, and UDP-glucuronic acid. Transport of these nucleotide sugars into Golgi protein proteoliposomes occurred with the same affinity, temperature dependence, and sensitivity to inhibitors as observed with intact Golgi vesicles. Preloading of proteoliposomes with UMP, the putative antiporter for Golgi vesicle transport of these nucleotide sugars, stimulated transport of the nucleotide sugars by 2-3-fold. Transport of UDP-xylose into Golgi protein proteoliposomes was dependent on the presence of endogenous Golgi membrane lipids while that of UDP-galactose and UDP-glucuronic acid was not. This suggests a possible stabilizing or regulatory role for Golgi lipids on the UDP-xylose translocator. Finally, we have also shown that detergent-solubilized Golgi membrane translocator proteins can be partially purified by an ion-exchange chromatographic step before successful reconstitution into liposomes, demonstrating that this reconstitution approach can be used for the biochemical purification of these transporters."
https://openalex.org/W1549002154,"By substituting template segments encoding AU-rich, GU-rich, and CA-rich transcripts for natural sequences upstream of the phage lambda rho-dependent tR1 termination site, we demonstrate that cytidines are required in the upstream RNA for rho-dependent termination to occur. These results are extended through in vitro mutagenesis of a template encoding an inactive AU-rich upstream sequence: certain mutant templates encoding new cytidines are able to activate rho-dependent termination. Cytidines must be dispersed over a region of the transcript in order for rho to be activated, although no specific pattern of cytidines appears to be required. The results show that no local clustering or regular spacing of cytidines is necessary and that cytidines are not used as a ruler to determine the location of termination sites. Rho is somewhat sensitive to the relative positions of cytidines since slightly different nascent transcripts activate rho termination activity to various degrees. A model is presented in which hexameric rho binds 78 nucleotides of contiguous RNA in a primary site, such that each monomer interacts with at least one cytidine somewhere in the 13 nucleotides allotted to the monomeric primary site."
https://openalex.org/W1538040864,"3-Hydroxydicarboxylic acids are major urinary metabolites derived from fatty acid metabolism. These compounds are produced from the omega-oxidation of 3-hydroxy fatty acids. The production of the precursor 3-hydroxy fatty acids from incomplete beta-oxidation of fatty acids in rat liver mitochondria was investigated. Independent of the chain length or the concentration of fatty acid substrates, the accumulation of 3-hydroxyacyl intermediates was relatively constant at the concentration of 3-5 nmol/mg of mitochondrial protein. The extent of the incomplete oxidation was the same in Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria. Rotenone treatment increased the production of 3-hydroxy fatty acids. 3-Hydroxy fatty acids did not exist as pure L-enantiomer as expected from beta-oxidation. Instead, these metabolites were epimerized to a near racemic mixture of D- and L-isomers with a slightly dominant D-isomer (58 +/- 3%). By using deuterium-isotope labeling, the mechanism of epimerizartion was shown to be a rapid dehydration-rehydration through trans-2-enoyl-CoA. In addition, cis-3 and trans-3 fatty acids were produced; these metabolites were derived from the isomerization of trans-2-enoyl-CoA. Epimerase and isomerase were thought to be enzymes involved in the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. Current data have shown that the metabolism of these acids is actually through NADPH-dependent reduction pathways. The activities of epimerase and isomerase detected in rat liver mitochondria possibly function mainly in the metabolism of saturated fatty acids in a reverse role to the conventional concept."

https://openalex.org/W1539292357,"To understand the mechanism of diphtheria toxin membrane translocation, the toxin was entrapped within lipid vesicles, and its low pH-induced translocation across the lipid bilayer was measured. Proteolysis and resistance to guanidinium chloride denaturation were used to demonstrate that the toxin molecules were entrapped. Low pH-induced movement of entrapped toxin to the outer (trans) face of the bilayer was assayed by the binding of external streptavidin to biotin-labeled entrapped toxin. Complete translocation was quantified by the amount of protein released into the external medium. Using whole toxin, it was found that the A fragment was efficiently translocated, but the B fragment was not. This was true both in the low temperature (A domain folded) and high temperature (A domain unfolded) toxin conformations previously identified [Jiang J. X., Abrams, F. S., and London, E. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 3857-3864]. Remarkably, even isolated fragment A appeared to self-translocate under some conditions. Toxin-induced translocation may partly result from formation of a nonspecific toxin-induced pore. This idea is supported by the toxin-induced release of fluorescent dextrans coentrapped within the vesicles. However, low pH-induced exposure of entrapped toxin on the outside of the membrane was conformation dependent. Exposure was greatest for the high temperature conformation. This suggests the existence of a more specific translocation process. The nature and relationship of these processes, and their relative roles in translocation in vivo are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1500382433,"Recent studies from this laboratory have shown that fetuin 1) is nearly 50-fold more efficient than albumin in incorporating exogenous fatty acids into cultured cells, (JBC, 265: 5883, 1990), and 2) is associated with a lipoprotein-like particle (FASEB J. 3: 2075-2080, 1989). In the present study, this lipid-containing fraction (FLP) was isolated by ultracentrifugation, and its effect on cholesterol efflux from cultured human skin fibroblasts and Hep-G2 cells prelabeled with [14C]cholesterol was investigated. FLP fraction caused a significant efflux of [14C]cholesterol from cells, the same in magnitude as HDL. This effect of fetuin supranatant fraction increased proportionately with concentration and time. Similar results were observed with Hep-G2 cells. This ability to induce efflux of cholesterol was confirmed by a decrease in cholesterol mass of cells after 24 h incubation with FLP. The ultracentrifugal bottom (infranatant) fraction of fetuin (FI) was ineffective in this regard. However, FI was more effective in the incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into cellular triglycerides. These studies suggest that the fetuin molecule is a multifunctional protein (delivery of fatty acids to cells and cholesterol efflux from cells) which may play a role in lipid transport during fetal life.—Kumbla, L.; Bhadra, S.; Subbiah, M. T. R. Multifunctional role for fetuin (fetal protein) in lipid transport. FASEB J. 5: 2971-2975; 1991."

https://openalex.org/W1598185359,"Abstract Many organic cations are transported across the apical membrane of the proximal tubule by specific saturable mechanisms. The goal of this study was to determine if the transporter for tetraethylammonium (TEA) in the brush border membrane of an established opossum kidney (OK) cell line is glycosylated and to elucidate the function of this glycosylation. The uptake of TEA was determined in OK cell monolayers treated with tunicamycin (TM), a compound that prevents synthesis of the core oligosaccharide precursor molecules. TM exposure significantly decreased the incorporation of [3H]mannose in OK cell proteins and significantly reduced TEA uptake in a time and a concentration dependent manner. No effect of TM exposure on cellular protein synthesis, DNA content, cell viability, or on [3H]proline uptake was observed. The transport of TEA in control cells was characterized by a Km of 26.9 +/- 16.4 microM and a Vmax of 378 +/- 39 pmol/mg of protein/min. TM treatment (1 microgram/ml for 21 h) significantly increased the Km by over 4-fold to 111.5 +/- 18.4 microM while not affecting the Vmax. The apparent KI values of other organic cations known to interact with this transport system were also significantly increased by TM exposure. Estimated KI values of N1-methylnicotinamide, cimetidine, and mepiperphenidol increased by 6-fold, 4-fold, and 2-fold, respectively, after exposure of OK cells to TM. An increased KI for protons was also observed. Additional inhibitors of the N-linked glycosylation pathway, castanospermine, deoxynojirimycin, and deoxymannojirimycin significantly decreased TEA transport, whereas swainsonine had no effect. Our results suggest that the organic cation transporter is glycosylated. The N-linked oligosaccharide side chain appears to be of the hybrid type, and it either directly or indirectly affects the binding site of the transporter for both organic cations and protons. This is the first report describing the importance of glycosylation in the function of the organic cation transporter in the apical membrane of OK cells."
https://openalex.org/W1670743000,"Abstract A retrovirus-like 30S (VL30) gene induced in mouse epidermis after a single application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was used as a model gene to define mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in keratinocytes. Sequences important for TPA and epidermal growth factor-induced transcription were found to be separated from eacho other within the long terminal repeat. Deletion mapping of the long terminal repeat region and linking short sequences to a heterologous promoter made it possible to identify a 28-base pair VL30 TPA-responsive element. VL30 TPA-responsive element mediated both basal and TPA-induced transcription in the mouse keratinocyte cell line Balb/MK and in normal human keratinocytes. Gel-retardation and transient transfection experiments indicated that two nuclear factors (VLX and VLY) bind independently to the VL30 TPA-responsive element in juxtaposed positions and that the binding sites collaborate functionally in constitutive and TPA-induced transcription. The sequence involved in VLY binding shows no homology to previously identified binding motifs. Two different sequences involved in mediating TPA-induced transcription of the urokinase plasminogen activator and of the c-jun gene, respectively, competed for proteins with affinity toward the VLX binding site. No competition was found with sequences containing the consensus AP-1 binding site."

M., Evans, W. H., and Sagi-Eisenberg, R. (1990) Biochem. J. 272, 453-458; Udrisar, D., and Rodbell, M. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 6321-6325). We have now purified p100 to near-homogeneity from rat liver microsomes. The protein was purified approximately 500-fold by ATP extraction followed by a series of four chromatographic steps. Similar to partially purified p100, on two-dimensional electrophoresis, the final preparation contained a major series of five immunoreactive 100-kDa charge isoforms. Partial amino terminus amino acid sequencing of the purified protein revealed that p100 is a previously unidentified protein. Further analysis of the soluble form of p100 showed the protein migrated with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 110,000 on gel filtration, indicating that the soluble protein occurs as a monomeric polypeptide. The soluble form of p100 was also partially purified from rat liver cytosol and amino acid sequencing yielded the same amino-terminal sequence as obtained from the microsome-associated form. The amino-terminal sequence of p100 exhibits significant similarity to the deduced amino-terminal amino acid sequences of both alpha- and gamma-adaptins. Using the amino-terminal sequence from p100, we have raised antipeptide polyclonal antisera. The antisera reacted specifically with the purified 100-kDa protein on immunoblots. With the purified protein and specific antisera now available, it will be possible to explore the physiological role of p100."
https://openalex.org/W1490117351,"Patch-clamp studies have identified a cAMP-dependent Cl– conductance in lymphocytes that is defectively regulated in cystic fibrosis. In this study we used 125I efflux and whole-cell patch-clamp studies to investigate whether prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), an agonist that generates intracellular cAMP in Jurkat T lymphocytes, activates a Cl– conductance. Stimulation of T cells by externally applied PGE1 stimulated 125I efflux and activated a slowly developing membrane current. When external and internal Cl– were about equal, the current reversed at about zero mV, but when external Cl– was lowered from 157 to 7 mm the reversal potential shifted 75 mV in the positive direction, demonstrating that the current carrier was Cl–. In addition, the current was blocked by 10 μm 5-nitro-2(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB), a potent Cl– channel blocker. A membrane-permeable cAMP analog mimicked the effect of PGE1, whereas intracellular application of a cAMP antagonist Rp-cAMP blocked the effect of PGE1. Addition of purified catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) plus ATP to the recording pipette also activated a similar current, whereas internally applied Walsh inhibitor, the synthetic peptide inhibitor of PKA, blocked the PGE1 effect. These results suggest that PGE1, acting through PKA, activates a Cl– current in Jurkat T cells.—Maldonado, D.; Schumann, M.; Nghiem, P.; Dong, Y.; Gardner, P.
