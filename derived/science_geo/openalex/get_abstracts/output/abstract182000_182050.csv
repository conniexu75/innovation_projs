The molecular components of the muscle stretch sensor are unknown, and their role in muscle disease is unclear. Here, we present biophysical/biochemical studies in muscle LIM protein (MLP) deficient cardiac muscle that support a selective role for this Z disc protein in mechanical stretch sensing. MLP interacts with and colocalizes with telethonin (T-cap), a titin interacting protein. Further, a human MLP mutation (W4R) associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) results in a marked defect in T-cap interaction/localization. We propose that a Z disc MLP/T-cap complex is a key component of the in vivo cardiomyocyte stretch sensor machinery, and that defects in the complex can lead to human DCM and associated heart failure."

The putative molecular sensor for inducers is Keap1, a sulfhydryl-rich protein that sequesters the transcription factor Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. Expression of these detoxication enzymes is blunted in <i>nrf2</i>-deficient mice; moreover, these mice are more sensitive to carcinogenesis, and the protective actions of dithiolethiones are lost with <i>nrf2</i> disruption. Hepatic gene expression profiles were examined by oligonucleotide microarray analysis in vehicle- or D3T-treated wild-type mice as well as in <i>nrf2</i> single and <i>keap1-nrf2</i>double knockout mice to identify those genes regulated by the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Transcript levels of 292 genes were elevated in wild-type mice 24 h after treatment with D3T; 79% of these genes were induced in wild-type, but not<i>nrf2</i>-deficient mice. These<i>nrf2</i>-dependent, D3T-inducible genes included known detoxication and antioxidative enzymes. Unexpected clusters included genes for chaperones, protein trafficking, ubiquitin/26 S proteasome subunits, and signaling molecules. Gene expression patterns in <i>keap1-nrf2</i> double knockout mice were similar to those in <i>nrf2</i>-single knockout mice. D3T also led to <i>nrf2</i>-dependent repression of 31 genes at 24 h; principally genes related to cholesterol/lipid biosynthesis. Collectively, D3T increases the expression of genes through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway that directly detoxify toxins and generate essential cofactors such as glutathione and reducing equivalents. Induction of<i>nrf2</i>-dependent genes involved in the recognition and repair/removal of damaged proteins expands the role of this pathway beyond primary control of electrophilic and oxidative stresses into secondary protective actions that enhance cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2094362595,"The ubiquitin-specific processing protease (UBP) family of deubiquitinating enzymes plays an essential role in numerous cellular processes. HAUSP, a representative UBP, specifically deubiquitinates and hence stabilizes the tumor suppressor protein p53. Here, we report the crystal structures of the 40 kDa catalytic core domain of HAUSP in isolation and in complex with ubiquitin aldehyde. These studies reveal that the UBP deubiquitinating enzymes exhibit a conserved three-domain architecture, comprising Fingers, Palm, and Thumb. The leaving ubiquitin moiety is specifically coordinated by the Fingers, with its C terminus placed in the active site between the Palm and the Thumb. Binding by ubiquitin aldehyde induces a drastic conformational change in the active site that realigns the catalytic triad residues for catalysis."

However, cisplatin can be expected to react also with nucleophiles other than DNA. Using enucleated cells (cytoplasts) we demonstrate here that cisplatin-induced apoptotic signaling may occur independently of DNA damage. Cisplatin-induced caspase-3 activation in cytoplasts required calcium and the activity of the calcium-dependent protease calpain. It is known that calpain activation may be associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, suggesting that the ER is a cytosolic target of cisplatin. Consistent with this hypothesis, cisplatin induced calpain-dependent activation of the ER-specific caspase-12 in cytoplasts as well as in intact cells. Cisplatin also induced increased expression of Grp78/BiP, another marker of ER stress. By contrast, the DNA-damaging topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide did not induce apoptotic signaling in cytoplasts nor ER stress in intact cells. We have thus identified a novel mechanism of action of cisplatin. The results have implications for the understanding of resistance mechanisms as well as the unique efficiency of this drug.

Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent generally recognized as a DNA-damaging drug. The molecular mechanisms that link the formation of DNA adducts to cell death-inducing signaling are not well understood. We have previously reported that cisplatin induces at least two apoptotic signaling pathways. One involves calpain activation and calpain-mediated cleavage of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bid. The other one results in MEKK1 1The abbreviations used are: MEKK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; wt, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, propidium iodide; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxy methyl ester); ROS, reactive oxygen species; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter 1The abbreviations used are: MEKK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; wt, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, propidium iodide; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxy methyl ester); ROS, reactive oxygen species; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter-dependent modulation of the proapoptotic protein Bak (1Mandic A.

Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3003-3013Google Scholar). Both pathways contribute to cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase activation. In aqueous solutions, the chloride ligands of cisplatin are replaced by water molecules generating a positively charged electrophile. This electrophile reacts with nucleophilic sites on intracellular macromolecules to form DNA, RNA, and protein adducts (3Pascoe J.M. Roberts J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 1359-1365Google Scholar). Approximately 1% of intracellular cisplatin reacts with DNA resulting in intra- and interstrand cross-links, with an intrastrand cross-link between adjacent guanines as the most common adduct (4Eastman A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3927-3933Google Scholar, 5Eastman A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3912-3915Google Scholar). DNA adducts are considered the key toxic lesions induced by cisplatin; however, some studies have not shown a clear correlation between DNA adducts and cisplatin cytotoxicity (6Vaisman A. Varchenko M. Said I. Chaney S.G. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 54-64Google Scholar, 7Burger H. Nooter K. Boersma A.W. Kortland C.J. Stoter G. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 592-599Google Scholar). The potential contribution of cisplatin-induced RNA or protein damage to cytotoxicity has not been examined in this respect (8Perez R.P. Eur. J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 1535-1542Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the ability of cisplatin to induce apoptosis independently of DNA damage, and we here report the ability of cisplatin to induce apoptosis in enucleated cells. The cisplatin response was also found to involve endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Altogether, we have here identified an apoptotic pathway induced by cisplatin independently of its DNA-damaging activity. This novel mechanism of action may contribute to the understanding of the causes of sensitivity and resistance to cisplatin. The human melanoma cell line 224 and two variants of the colon cancer cell lines HCT116 (wt and p53-deficient) (9Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Google Scholar) were used. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%),l-glutamate, penicillin, and streptomycin. The cells were harvested, resuspended in 12.5% Ficoll containing complete medium supplemented with cytochalasin B (10 μg/ml), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Three ml of this cell suspension was layered onto a density gradient prepared in ultracentrifuge tubes with the following layers: 2 ml of 25%, 2 ml of 17%, 0.5 ml of 16%, and 0.5 ml of 15% Ficoll. The gradient was prepared in complete medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml of cytochalasin B and pre-equilibrated in a CO2 incubator overnight. The cells were then centrifuged in a prewarmed (32 °C) Beckman SW41 swing bucket rotor for 60 min at 25,000 rpm. The resulting enucleated cytoplasts were collected at the interface between the 16 and 17% Ficoll layers and were then washed with medium and allowed to recover for 2 h before drug treatment. The purity of the cytoplast preparation was determined by resuspending cytoplasts in PBS containing digitonin (50 μg/ml) and labeling with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI). After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, fluorescence was monitored using the FL2 channel on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer. Cell extract proteins (30 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blotting. The following antibodies were used: anti-caspase-12 (1: 250, a kind gift from Dr. J. Yuan), anti-Grp78/BiP (1:500; BD Transduction Laboratories), and anti-Bid (1:1,000; Molecular Probes, Inc.). Tubulin was used as an internal standard for loading. After treatment cells were harvested, washed with PBS, fixed in paraformaldehyde (0.25%, 5 min), washed three times with PBS, and incubated for 60 min with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody recognizing active caspase-3 (Pharmingen). The antibody was diluted 1:50 in PBS containing digitonin (50 μg/ml). After incubation, the cells were washed with PBS, and fluorescence was monitored using the FL1 channel of a FACS Calibur flow cytometer. DEVDase activity was assessed using the fluorigenic Ac-DEVD-AMC substrate (CaspACE Assay; Promega Life Science). The harvested cells were centrifuged, washed in ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin and leupeptin). The cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing in liquid nitrogen. The lysates were centrifuged (16,000 × g for 20 min), and supernatant fractions were collected. The caspase activity was assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescence produced upon cleavage of the labeled substrate is proportional to the caspase activity in the sample. Upon induction of apoptosis, the proapoptotic Bak protein undergoes a conformational change that exposes an otherwise inaccessible N-terminal epitope (10Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C. Hickman J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 903-914Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used the same antibody that was shown to specifically recognize this epitope (mouse monoclonal antibody against amino acids 1–52 of Bak; Oncogene Research Products; number AM03, clone TC100). Using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody, the increases in accessibility of the epitope were monitored by flow cytometry as earlier described (1Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Molin M. Akusjärvi G. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3684-3691Google Scholar). The data are presented as fold increases in immunofluorescence from control levels. 224 human melanoma and HCT 116 human colon cancer cells were enucleated as described and treated with cisplatin to investigate whether cisplatin can induce nucleus-independent apoptosis. The purity of the cytoplast preparation was determined by staining digitonin-permeabilized cytoplasts with PI and analyzing the sample by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.1 A (panel I), intact cells demonstrate a 10-fold higher PI fluorescence than cytoplasts, allowing analysis of these two populations separately, by way of electronic gating. Apoptosis was assessed as activation of caspase-3 using an antibody that specifically recognizes active caspase-3. After treatment with 15 and 20 μm cisplatin for 16 h, the cytoplast preparations were analyzed for PI fluorescence and active caspase-3. In untreated samples, the cut-off for activated caspase-3 was set immediately to the right of the cell/cytoplast population (Fig.1 A). After cisplatin treatment, 43 and 48% of the 224 cytoplasts, respectively, showed activation of caspase-3 (Fig.1 B). 224 cells harbor mutated p53. To confirm that cisplatin-induced apoptosis is independent of p53 status, we compared the effect of cisplatin on wt and p53−/− HCT 116 cytoplasts, respectively. Similar levels of induction of caspase-3 activation were observed in wt and p53−/− cytoplasts after treatment with cisplatin (Fig. 1, C and D). Bak is a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein involved in cytochromec release from mitochondria. We have previously found that cisplatin induces a proapoptotic conformational modulation of Bak in 224 cells (1Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Molin M. Akusjärvi G. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3684-3691Google Scholar). This modulation is assessed with an antibody recognizing a specific N-terminal epitope that is exposed only when Bak is in its activated, proapoptotic form. To determine whether cisplatin can induce nucleus-independent activation of Bak, we examined conformational modulation of Bak in cisplatin-treated cytoplasts. As shown in Fig.2 A, cisplatin induces activation of Bak in 224 cytoplasts. However, this activation is weaker compared with Bak activation in intact 224 cells. Weak Bak activation was also observed in HCT 116 p53 wt and p53-deficient cytoplasts (Fig.2 B). We have previously shown that cisplatin induces cleavage of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bid to its active form tBid (2Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Strandberg L. Heiden T. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3003-3013Google Scholar). tBid is in turn involved in cytochrome c release from mitochondria in both the extrinsic (11Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Google Scholar, 12Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Google Scholar) and intrinsic proapoptotic pathways (13Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17484-17490Google Scholar, 14Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Google Scholar). Cisplatin-induced Bid cleavage was therefore examined also in 224 cytoplasts, and the results show that Bid is indeed cleaved (Fig. 2 C). As we have reported, cisplatin-induced Bid cleavage is carried out by calpain (2Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Strandberg L. Heiden T. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3003-3013Google Scholar). To investigate whether calpain is involved in nucleus-independent apoptosis, we studied the effect of the calpain inhibitor calpeptin on caspase-3 activation in enucleated 224 cells. Cotreatment with calpeptin was found to block cisplatin-induced caspase-3 activation by approximately half (Fig.3 A). An increase in intracellular calcium is required for calpain activation. Accordingly, cisplatin-induced calpain activation in 224 cells is calcium-dependent (2Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Strandberg L. Heiden T. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3003-3013Google Scholar). Because increased intracellular calcium was also observed in cisplatin-treated enucleated 224 cells (not shown), we examined the effect of the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM on caspase-3 activation in cisplatin-treated cytoplasts. As shown in Fig. 3 B, cotreatment with BAPTA-AM inhibited caspase-3 activation by ∼60%. The ER participates in regulation of cellular responses to stress and alterations in calcium homeostasis (15Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Google Scholar, 16Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Google Scholar). Caspase-12 is an ER-specific caspase that is activated by ER stress and that specifically participates in ER stress-induced apoptosis (17Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Google Scholar). Calpain has been indicated as a protease responsible for activation of caspase-12 (18Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Google Scholar). The finding that cisplatin induces increased cytosolic calcium and calpain activation suggested that the ER might be a non-nuclear target of cisplatin. The ability of cisplatin to induce ER stress was assessed as activation of caspase-12, reflected in cleavage of 60-kDa procaspase-12. This cleavage was significant at 4 h after cisplatin treatment and was confirmed at 8 h (Fig.4 A). Cleavage was furthermore blocked by calpeptin and by BAPTA-AM (Fig. 4 A). Cleavage of caspase-12 was also observed in cytoplasts after 4 and 16 h (Fig.4 B). DEVDase activity (caspase-7) has also been reported as mediator of caspase-12 activation (19Rao R.V. Hermel E. Castro-Obregon S. del Rio G. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33869-33874Google Scholar). To rule out involvement of these caspases in the initial cleavage of caspase-12, DEVDase activity in 224 cells and cytoplasts was assessed at 4 h after cisplatin treatment. No increase in DEVDase activity was observed in 224 cells or cytoplasts at this time point, whereas markedly increased activity was seen at 16 h (Fig. 4 C). Grp78 (glucose-regulated protein78) is an ER chaperone protein that is up-regulated by ER stress (15Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Google Scholar, 16Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Google Scholar). To confirm the ability of cisplatin to induce ER stress, we examined expression of this protein after cisplatin treatment. In 224 cells a 2.6-fold increase in Grp78 protein expression was seen at 16 h after cisplatin treatment (Fig.5 A). Induction of Grp78 expression was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5 B) and was not affected by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig.5 C). Cisplatin has been shown to induce production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (20Miyajima A. Nakashima J. Tachibana M. Nakamura K. Hayakawa M. Murai M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1999; 90: 565-570Google Scholar, 21Benhar M. Dalyot I. Engelberg D. Levitzki A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6913-6926Google Scholar) that have been reported as important mediators of the stress response in many cell types (22Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Google Scholar). We have previously observed that pretreatment of 224 cells with the ROS scavengerN-acetyl cysteine (NAC) inhibits cisplatin-induced mitochondrial depolarization and nuclear fragmentation by ∼60% (not shown). However, NAC failed to inhibit calpain activation in cisplatin-treated cells (not shown); thus, cisplatin-induced apoptosis also involves events that are not ROS-dependent. To investigate the possible involvement of oxidative stress in ER stress, we examined the expression of Grp78 in cells treated with cisplatin in the presence or absence of NAC. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the presence of NAC did not affect up-regulation of Grp78 levels after cisplatin treatment. This indicates that oxidative stress is not involved in the induction of ER stress by cisplatin. Apoptosis induced by ER stress involves downstream activation of caspase-3. To investigate whether Grp78 induction correlates with caspase-3 activation, both events were studied simultaneously in cisplatin-treated 224 cells. The cells were permeabilized with digitonin, double-stained with anti-Grp78 and anti-caspase-3 antibodies, and analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig.6). At 16 h post-treatment the median value for Grp78-associated immunofluorescence had increased, and activation of caspase-3 occurred in the population showing the highest Grp78 levels (Fig. 6). We have earlier shown that caspase-3 activation commences around 16 h post-treatment and increases sharply between 16 and 24 h (1Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Molin M. Akusjärvi G. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3684-3691Google Scholar). At 20 h, a population of cells with activated caspase-3 has lower Grp78, indicating the presence of ER-independent activation of caspase-3 at this later time point. To demonstrate the specificity of cisplatin in inducing nucleus-independent apoptosis, we treated 224 cytoplasts with etoposide. This is also a DNA-damaging drug, but as a topoisomerase II-inhibitor it has a different mechanism of action than cisplatin. Etoposide failed to induce caspase-3 activation in enucleated cells (Fig. 7 A), and thus, in contrast to cisplatin, the effect of etoposide is dependent on an effect on DNA. Furthermore, etoposide did not have any effect on ER, because no up-regulation of Grp78 (Fig. 7 B) nor caspase-12 activation (Fig. 7 C) was observed in etoposide-treated cells. Cisplatin is a broadly active cytotoxic anticancer drug. In aqueous solutions, the molecule is rendered highly reactive and reacts with nucleophilic sites on intracellular macromolecules. The role of cisplatin adducts on proteins and/or RNA in cisplatin-induced apoptosis is at present unclear. Instead, it is generally accepted that nuclear DNA is the critical target of cisplatin, even though only 1% of the intracellular cisplatin reacts with DNA. Accordingly, nuclear DNA repair-deficient cell lines may show enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin (23Fraval H.N. Roberts J.J. Chem. Biol. Inter. 1978; 23: 99-110Google Scholar, 24Hoy C.A. Thompson L.H. Mooney C.L. Salazar E.P. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 1737-1743Google Scholar, 25Dijt F.J. Fichtinger-Schepman A.M. Berends F. Reedijk J. Cancer Res. 1998; 48: 6058-6062Google Scholar). Cisplatin has also been found to be able to bind to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (26Murata T. Hibasami H. Maekawa S. Tagawa T. Nakashima K. Biochem. Inter. 1990; 20: 949-955Google Scholar). However, mtDNA constitutes about 1/1,000 of the cell DNA, and, to our knowledge, no molecular sensors have been identified that would link damaged mtDNA to the apoptotic machinery, suggesting that mtDNA is not a major target. Nevertheless, there are also studies reporting a lack of correlation between cisplatin sensitivity and accumulation of intracellular cisplatin and/or DNA platination (5Eastman A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3912-3915Google Scholar, 6Vaisman A. Varchenko M. Said I. Chaney S.G. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 54-64Google Scholar) and conflicting reports on the correlation of p53 status with tumor cell resistance or susceptibility to cisplatin (7Burger H. Nooter K. Boersma A.W. Kortland C.J. Stoter G. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 592-599Google Scholar). In a panel of nine melanoma cell lines, we have found no correlation between cisplatin sensitivity and p53 status. 2A. Mandic, J. Hansson, S. Linder, and M. C. Shoshan, unpublished results. Platination of cellular proteins and/or RNA is a very likely effect of cisplatin in treatment of cells (27Peleg-Shulman T. Najajreh Y. Gibson D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 306-311Google Scholar), but the contribution of platination to the cytotoxicity of cisplatin has not been investigated. This is the first report to show that cisplatin-induced apoptosis is not exclusively dependent on DNA damage and the presence of nuclei. We show here that cisplatin is able to induce proapoptotic signaling and caspase-3 activation in enucleated cells (cytoplasts). Cytoplast preparations also contain a small amount of intact cells with nuclei, which were treated in the same way as cytoplasts, including incubation with cytochalasin B and gradient centrifugation. This population of intact cells was used to directly compare levels of caspase-3 and Bak activation in cytoplasts and intact cells. Higher caspase-3 activation induced by cisplatin was observed in cytoplasts than in intact cells in both 224 and HCT 116 cell lines. This increased activity may be due to the ability of nucleus-containing cells to induce expression of protective proteins in response to cisplatin-induced stress,e.g. Hsp70 (heat shockprotein 70) or XIAP (X-linkedinhibitor of apoptosis protein). Hsp70 can block apoptosis by interfering with proteins involved in the execution phase of apoptosis such as protease activating factor-1 (28Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Google Scholar) and apoptosis inducing factor (29Ravagnan L. Gurbuxani S. Susin S.A. Maisse C. Daugas E. Zamzami N. Mak T. Jaattela M. Penninger J.M. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 839-843Google Scholar). XIAP blocks apoptosis by inhibiting active caspase-3 and caspase-9 (30Bratton S.B. Lewis J. Butterworth M. Duckett C.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 881-892Google Scholar). Although the cisplatin-induced caspase-3 activity was higher in cytoplasts than in intact cells, Bak activation in 224 cytoplasts was only slightly increased compared with the 2.5-fold induction of Bak activity in 224 cells. A possible explanation is that Bak activation is predominantly dependent on MEKK1-mediated signaling and that this pathway may be activated by DNA damage rather than by ER stress. The lower Bak activation seen in cytoplasts might instead represent activation of the calpain-Bid pathway, which we have shown to be distinct from the MEKK1 pathway (2Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Strandberg L. Heiden T. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3003-3013Google Scholar). tBid has been reported to stimulate formation of Bak oligomer pores in the mitochondrial membrane (31Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Google Scholar). Because cleavage and activation of Bid was found in 224 cytoplasts, we suggest that Bid-mediated modulation of Bak might be responsible for the slight activation observed in 224 and HCT 116 cytoplasts. Calpains are a family of cytosolic cysteine proteases, and their activation is preceded by increased levels of cytosolic calcium. We have previously found that increased cytosolic calcium and calpain activation are early events in cisplatin-induced apoptosis and have also presented evidence for calpain-mediated cleavage of Bid in cisplatin-treated 224 cells (2Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Strandberg L. Heiden T. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3003-3013Google Scholar). Here we have shown that these events may occur independently of DNA damage. These findings also suggested that the ER might be the non-nuclear target of cisplatin. The ER plays an important role in maintenance of intracellular calcium homeostasis, protein synthesis, post-translational modifications, and proper folding of proteins as well as their sorting and trafficking. Alterations in calcium homeostasis and accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER cause ER stress. A variety of agents, including chemical toxicants, oxidative stress, inhibitors of protein glycosylation, calcium ionophores, and other agents that alter calcium homeostasis can all induce ER stress followed by cell death (16Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of the ER in cisplatin-induced apoptosis, we examined activation of caspase-12 and up-regulation of Grp78. Apoptosis induced by ER stress has been shown to involve calpain-mediated activation of caspase-12 (18Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Google Scholar). Caspase-12 is localized to the ER and may be activated by disruption of calcium homeostasis and accumulation of excess proteins in ER but not by membrane- or mitochondria-targeted apoptotic signals (17Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Google Scholar). Murine caspase-12 is a member of the ICE (interleukin-1β convertingenzyme) subfamily of caspases. The amino acid sequence of caspase-12 shows high homology with human caspase-4 (48% identity) and caspase-5 (45% identity). The monoclonal antibody used in the present study has been shown to detect a human counterpart of caspase-12 and to locate it to the ER in HeLa cells (17Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Google Scholar). The same antibody has also been used for detection of caspase-12 cleavage in human epithelial cells (32Bitko V. Barik S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 80: 441-454Google Scholar). This is the first report to show the involvement of ER stress, specifically seen as caspase-12 activation and up-regulation of Grp78, in cisplatin-induced apoptosis. We also present evidence for nucleus-independent activation of caspase-12. In accordance with calpain-mediated activation of caspase-12, both calpeptin and BAPTA were able to block cisplatin-induced cleavage of caspase-12 in 224 cells. Although caspase-7 has also been reported to cleave procaspase-12 (19Rao R.V. Hermel E. Castro-Obregon S. del Rio G. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33869-33874Google Scholar), it is probably not involved in our system, because no DEVDase was detected at 4 h post-treatment, when caspase-12 was already cleaved. Cisplatin has been shown to induce oxidative stress in variety of cell lines. As expected, cotreatment of 224 cells with the ROS scavenger NAC resulted in decreased nuclear fragmentation and mitochondrial depolarization. However, NAC did not have any effect on the induction of Grp78, showing that ROS production is not required for ER stress. This is supported by the findings that calpain is likely involved in caspase-12 activation and that NAC did not block calpain activation. For unknown reasons, basal expression levels of Grp78 varied widely in the 224 cells. However, cisplatin induced a general increase in Grp78 expression, and this effect was independent of caspase-12 and caspase-3 activation, because the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk did not affect it. At 16 h, caspase-3 was activated in cells with high Grp78 expression. Interestingly, there was also a population with high Grp78 expression but no caspase-3 activation (Fig. 6 b,upper left quadrant). The size of this population is reduced to below control levels only at the later time point and with the higher dose. This observation is in accordance with the antiapoptotic or protective effect of Grp78, which possibly has some specificity against drugs inducing calcium depletion from the ER (16Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Google Scholar). With this antiapoptotic action, Grp78 may well contribute to resistance against cisplatin, which may now be counted among the ER-active anti-cancer drugs. The basal level of Grp78 is up-regulated in many tumors (16Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Google Scholar), but to our knowledge, the relationship between Grp78 levels and cisplatin sensitivity/resistance has not been studied. In contrast to cisplatin, etoposide, which is also a DNA-damaging drug but which achieves its effect by inhibition of topoisomerase II, did not induce caspase-3 activation in cytoplasts. Etoposide thus requires nuclear events to induce apoptosis. Furthermore, etoposide-induced apoptosis does not involve ER stress because it did not induce caspase-12 activation in 224 cells or cytoplasts, nor did it lead to increased Grp78 expression in 224 cells. In summary, we here demonstrate a novel mechanism of action for cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent hitherto regarded as a typical DNA-damaging agent. Cisplatin is here shown to induce apoptosis in the absence of DNA damage, and the ER is likely its non-nuclear target. We propose that the ability to activate two, rather than a single, major pathways to apoptosis makes cisplatin so generally efficient as an anti-cancer agent. Lastly, we believe that our findings will lead to a re-evaluation of resistance-determining factors for cisplatin and possibly to new, improved treatment strategies to overcome resistance. We are grateful for the kind gift of caspase-12 antibody from Dr. J. Yuan (Harvard Medical School)."
https://openalex.org/W2071827932,"Vaccination has proved a powerful defence against a range of infectious diseases of humans and animals. However, its potential to control major epidemics of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in livestock is contentious. Using an individual farm-based model, we consider either national prophylactic vaccination campaigns in advance of an outbreak, or combinations of reactive vaccination and culling strategies during an epidemic. Consistent with standard epidemiological theory, mass prophylactic vaccination could reduce greatly the potential for a major epidemic, while the targeting of high-risk farms increases efficiency. Given sufficient resources and preparation, a combination of reactive vaccination and culling might control ongoing epidemics. We also explore a reactive strategy, 'predictive' vaccination, which targets key spatial transmission loci and can reduce markedly the long tail that characterizes many FMD epidemics. These analyses have broader implications for the control of human and livestock infectious diseases in heterogeneous spatial landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W1986167698,"We have explored the effects of two members of the p160 coregulator family on energy homeostasis. TIF2-/- mice are protected against obesity and display enhanced adaptive thermogenesis, whereas SRC-1-/- mice are prone to obesity due to reduced energy expenditure. In white adipose tissue, lack of TIF2 decreases PPARgamma activity and reduces fat accumulation, whereas in brown adipose tissue it facilitates the interaction between SRC-1 and PGC-1alpha, which induces PGC-1alpha's thermogenic activity. Interestingly, a high-fat diet increases the TIF2/SRC-1 expression ratio, which may contribute to weight gain. These results reveal that the relative level of TIF2/SRC-1 can modulate energy metabolism."

A striking feature is the presence of nine highly conserved, potentially charged residues in the transmembrane helices. Previous models have attempted to explain assembly based on pairwise interactions of these residues. Using a novel method for the isolation of intact radiolabeled protein complexes, we demonstrate that one basic and two acidic transmembrane residues are required for the assembly of each of the three signaling dimers with the TCR. This remarkable three-helix arrangement applies to all three assembly steps and represents the organizing principle for the formation of this intricate receptor structure."
https://openalex.org/W2003049938,"Inward rectifier K+ channels govern the resting membrane voltage in many cells. Regulation of these ion channels via G protein-coupled receptor signaling underlies the control of heart rate and the actions of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. We have determined the protein structure formed by the intracellular N- and C termini of the G protein-gated inward rectifier K+ channel GIRK1 at 1.8 Å resolution. A cytoplasmic pore, conserved among inward rectifier K+ channels, extends the ion pathway to 60 Å, nearly twice the length of a canonical transmembrane K+ channel. The cytoplasmic pore is lined by acidic and hydrophobic amino acids, creating a favorable environment for polyamines, which block the pore. These results explain in structural and chemical terms the basis of inward rectification, and they also have implications for G protein regulation of GIRK channels."

In bacteria, the most abundant class of neutral lipids are polyhydroxyalkanoic acids serving as intracellular carbon and energy storage compound (1Steinbüchel A. Byrom D. Biomaterials. MacMillan, London1991: 123-213Google Scholar), but also few examples of substantial triacylglycerol (TAG)1accumulation have been reported for species mainly belonging to the actinomycetes genera: Mycobacterium (2Barksdale L. Kim K.S. Bacteriol. Rev. 1977; 41: 217-372Google Scholar),Nocardia, and Rhodococcus (3Alvarez H.M. Kalscheuer R. Steinbüchel A. Fett/Lipid. 1997; 9: 239-246Google Scholar) andStreptomyces (4Olukoshi E.R. Packter N.M. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 931-943Google Scholar). Furthermore, biosynthesis of wax esters (oxoesters of long-chain primary fatty alcohols and long-chain fatty acids) has been frequently reported for members of the genusAcinetobacter (5Fixter L.M. Nagi M. McCormack J.G. Fewson C.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 3147-3157Google Scholar). TAGs are the dominating storage lipid in animals, plants, and eukaryotic microorganisms. TAG biosynthesis is involved in animals in numerous processes such as regulation of plasma TAG concentration, fat storage in adipocytes, and milk production (6Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Google Scholar). In plants, TAG synthesis is mainly important for the generation of seed oils (7Lassner M. Lipid Technol. 1997; 9: 5-9Google Scholar). Using diacylglycerol (DAG) as a substrate, three different classes of enzymes are known that mediate TAG formation (reviewed in Ref. 8Lehner R. Kuksis A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 169-201Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA:DAG acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the acylation of DAG using acyl-CoA as a substrate. Two DGAT families designated as DGAT1 and DGAT2 are known that exhibit no sequence homologies to each other. Members of the DGAT1 gene family occur in animals and plants (9Cases S. Smith S.J.

Jako C. Kumar A. Selvaraj G. Taylor D.C. Plant J. 1999; 19: 645-653Google Scholar), whereas members of the DGAT2 gene family were found in animals (13Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Google Scholar), plants (14Bouvier-Navé P. Benveniste P. Oelkers P. Sturley S.L. Schaller H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 85-96Google Scholar), and yeast (15Sandager L. Gustavsson M.H. Ståhl U. Dahlqvist A. Wiberg E. Banas A. Lenman M. Ronne H. Stymne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6478-6482Google Scholar). In human, oneDGAT1-related gene and five DGAT2-related genes were identified (13Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Google Scholar). Recently, DGAT has attracted great interest since it is a potential therapeutical target for obesity treatment (16Chen H.C. Farese Jr., R.V. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 188-192Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA-independent TAG synthesis is mediated by a phospholipid:DAG acyltransferase found in yeast and plants that uses phospholipids as acyl donors for DAG esterification (17Dahlqvist A. Ståhl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Google Scholar). A third alternative mechanism present in animals and plants is TAG synthesis by a DAG-DAG-transacylase, which uses DAG as acyl donor and acceptor yielding TAG and monoacylglycerol (18Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8781-8786Google Scholar, 19Stobart K. Mancha M. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Stymne S. Planta. 1997; 203: 58-66Google Scholar), although no gene coding such a transacylase could be identified as yet. Wax esters have diverse and important biological functions including coating of aerial surfaces of plants as epicuticular waxes to provide protection against desiccation, ultraviolet light, and attack of pathogens; regulation of buoyant density as the principal component of the spermaceti oil of sperm whales; and serving as energy storage materials in the seeds of the jojoba plant (20Ohlrogge J.B. Pollard M.R. Stumpf P.K. Lipids. 1978; 13: 203-210Google Scholar). The latter is the main natural source of wax esters for commercial applications since the world-wide ban on whale hunting. However, the high price of jojoba oil has limited its use. Wax esters have a multitude of important technical applications in a variety of areas, including medicine, cosmetics, and food industries as well as their more traditional usage as lubricants.Acinetobacter calcoaceticus accumulates wax esters intracellularly as insoluble inclusions under growth-limiting conditions. The chemical structure is similar to those wax esters produced by jojoba and the sperm whale with mainly a C32-C36 carbon length composed of saturated and unsaturated C16 and C18 fatty acid and fatty alcohol moieties (21Ervin J.L. Geigert J. Neidleman S.L. Wadsworth J. Ratledge C. Dawson P. Rattray L. Biotechnology for the oil and fats industry. American Oil Chemists Society, Champaign, IL1984: 217-222Google Scholar). Thus, analysis of microbial wax ester biosynthesis could provide a promising basis for the biotechnological production of low-cost jojoba-like wax esters. The key enzymatic step in wax ester biosynthesis is the final condensation of acyl-CoA and fatty alcohol yielding the wax ester catalyzed by the acyl-CoA:fatty alcohol acyltransferase (wax ester synthase, WS). The only WS gene described so far has been cloned from jojoba, but this WS was not active in Escherichia coli or yeast (22Lardizabal K.D. Metz J.G. Sakamoto T. Hutton W.C. Pollard M.R. Lassner M.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 645-655Google Scholar). Here we report on the identification of a bifunctional WS/DGAT, which is the first description of a bacterial protein mediating WS or DGAT activity. This bifunctional WS/DGAT is a new type of long-chain acyl-CoA acyltransferase, which also might have great importance forMycobacterium and Arabidopsis thaliana. The strains used are: A. calcoaceticus ADP1 (ATCC 33305),Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (23Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Stuart J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar), E. coli S17–1 (24Simon R.

Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Google Scholar). Plasmids used for cloning are pBluescript SK− and KS−(Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany), pBBR1MCS-2 (26Kovach M.E. Elzer P.H. Hill D.S. Robertson G.T. Farris M.A. Roop II R.M. Peterson K.M.

Cells ofA. calcoaceticus were cultivated aerobically in LB medium (27$$Google Scholar) in Erlenmeyer flasks at 30 °C. For the induction of wax ester and TAG formation and for determination of enzyme activities, cells were cultivated 24 h in mineral salts medium (MSM) (28Schlegel H.G. Kaltwasser H. Gottschalk G. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1961; 38: 209-222Google Scholar) with 0.1 g liter−1 NH4Cl and with 1% (w/v) sodium gluconate as carbon source. These conditions are referred to as “storage conditions.” Cells of E. coli and P. citronellolis were cultivated in LB medium at 37 and 30 °C, respectively. For recombinant wax ester production, P. citronellolis was cultivated under storage conditions for 48 h at 30 °C with 0.3% (w/v) 1-hexadecanol as sole carbon source. For determination of enzyme activities in recombinant R. opacusPD630 cells were cultivated for 24 h under storage conditions at 30 °C with 1% (w/v) gluconate. M. smegmatismc2155 was cultivated for 48 h under storage conditions at 30 °C with 1% (w/v) glucose. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations if appropriate: ampicillin, 75 μg ml−1; nalidixic acid, 10 μg ml−1; kanamycin, 50 μg ml−1; tetracycline, 12.5 μg ml−1. miniTn10Km-induced mutants of an isolated spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant strain of A. calcoaceticus ADP1 were generated according to Ref. 29Herrero M. de Lorenzo V.

Mutants defective in the accumulation of storage lipids were identified by staining with the lipophilic dye Sudan Black B as described in Ref. 30Reiser S. Somerville C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2969-2975Google Scholar and subjected to TLC for further analysis. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed as described (31Wältermann M. Luftmann H. Baumeister D. Kalscheuer R. Steinbüchel A. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1143-1149Google Scholar) using the solvent systems hexane/diethylether/acetic acid (90:15:1, v/v/v) for wax ester analysis or (80:20:1, v/v/v) for TAG analysis. Triolein was used as TAG reference substance and cetylpalmitate as wax ester reference substance. Fatty acid analysis of whole cells and purified TAGs and wax esters was done by gas chromatography (GC) according to Ref. 31Wältermann M. Luftmann H. Baumeister D. Kalscheuer R. Steinbüchel A. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1143-1149Google Scholar. An 8.9-kbp EcoRI fragment conferring kanamycin-resistance to E. coli due to the presence of miniTn10Km was isolated from total DNA of the mutant A. calcoaceticus ACM7. After subcloning into pBluescript SK−, DNA sequence was determined, and data were analyzed with the online program pack Biology WorkBench 3.2 at workbench.sdsc.edu. The WS/DGAT gene was amplified by tailored PCR employing the oligonucleotides 5′-AAAGAATTCAAGGAGGTATCCACGCTATGCGCCCATTAC-3′ (5′-end) introducing a ribosome binding site and 5′-TTTGGATCCAGGGCTAATTTAGCCCTTTAGTT-3′ (3′-end) and was cloned into pBluescript KS− collinear to the lacZpromoter, resulting in pKS::wax/dgat, and into pBBR1MCS-2 collinear to the lacZ promoter, resulting in pBBR1MCS-2::wax/dgat. The WS/DGAT homologue from M. smegmatis mc2155 exhibiting the highest similarity to the A. calcoaceticus ADP1 gene (designated as wdh3269 because of its localization on contig 3269) was amplified by tailored PCR using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-AAAGAATTCAAGGAGGTCAGCGTTGAATGAACCGGATGCA-3′ (5′-end) introducing a ribosome binding site and 5′-TTTAAGCTTTCAGGCGCCTGTGGCCGTCTCGA-3′ (3′-end). The obtained 1403-bp PCR product was cloned into pBluescript SK−collinear to the lacZ promoter, resulting in pSK::wdh3269. For heterologous expression inR. opacus PD630, HindIII-restricted pSK::wdh3269 was fused withHindIII-restricted pBBRKmNC903 resulting in pBBRKmNC903-pSK::wdh3269. Transfer of the fusion plasmid to R. opacus was done according to Ref. 32Kalscheuer R. Arenskötter M. Steinbüchel A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 52: 508-515Google Scholar. For heterologous expression, recombinant E. coli were cultivated for 6 h in the presence of 1 mm IPTG and recombinantP. citronellolis for 6 h and recombinant R. opacus PD630 for 24 h without IPTG, respectively. WS activity was measured in a total volume of 250 μl containing 3.75 mm1-hexadecanol, 4.63 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 4.72 μm[1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA (specific activity 1.961 Bq pmol−1), and 125 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Hexadecanol and bovine serum albumin were emulsified by ultrasonification. The assays were incubated at 35 °C for 30 min, and the reactions were stopped by extraction with 500 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). After centrifugation, the chloroform phase was withdrawn, evaporated to dryness, and 40 μg of chloroform-dissolved unlabeled reference wax ester (cetylpalmitate) were added. After separation of lipids by TLC and staining of TLC plates with iodine vapor, spots corresponding to waxes were scraped from the plates, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The DGAT activity assay was identical to the WS assay except that the reaction mixture contained 3.75 mm1,2-dipalmitoyl-rac-glycerol instead of 1-hexadecanol. Here triolein was used as the unlabeled TAG reference substance. Acyl-CoA specificity of the WS and DGAT reactions was assayed in a total volume of 250 μl containing 0.19 mm[1-14C]hexadecanol (specific activity 1.924 Bq pmol−1) or 0.09 mm oleic [1-14C]diolein (specific activity 2.035 Bq pmol−1), respectively, 4.63 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μmacyl-CoA, and 125 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) under the conditions described above. The WS/DGAT nucleotide sequence has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under GenBank Accession Number AF529086. A. calcoaceticus ADP1 accumulates wax ester and TAG intracellularly during cultivation under so-called storage conditions from gluconate with TAGs and wax esters amounting to up to 1.4 and 6.9% (w/v) of the cellular dry weight, respectively, as estimated by gas chromatographic fatty acid analysis of isolated TAGs and wax esters purified by TLC. We isolated the miniTn10Km-induced mutant A. calcoaceticus ACM7, which was unable to synthesize wax ester and accumulated only trace amounts of TAG as estimated by TLC (Fig.1 B). Genotypical characterization of the mutant revealed insertion of the transposon with a 9-bp direct repeat (5′-CGCTATGCG-3′) 4-bp upstream of the ATG start codon (shown in bold face) of a 1377-bp open reading frame, which we designated as wax/dgat (Fig.1 A). Since the coding region ofwax/dgat remained intact in A. calcoaceticus ACM7, we generated the knock-out mutant A. calcoaceticus ADP1wax/dgatΩKm by disrupting wax/dgat by insertion of a ΩKm gene cassette (33Overhage J. Priefert H. Rabenhorst J. Steinbüchel A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 52: 820-828Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The knock-out mutant also exhibited the wax ester-negative and TAG-leaky phenotype, thus demonstrating that the strong impact on biosynthesis of both storage lipids was really attributed to wax/dgat (Fig.1 B). Wild-type A. calcoaceticus ADP1 exhibited a WS activity of 90.37 pmol (mg min)−1 and a ∼10-fold lower DGAT activity (Table I), which corresponded approximately with the amounts of wax esters and TAGs accumulated under storage conditions as estimated by TLC (Fig.1 B). Inactivation of wax/dgat not only caused the loss of the ability for wax ester and TAG biosynthesis; it also abolished WS and DGAT activity in the transposon-induced as well as in the knock-out mutant (Table I).Table IWS and DGAT activities in crude cell extracts of different strainsStrainPlasmidWS activityDGAT activitypmol (mg min)−1pmol (mg min)−1A. calcoaceticusADP190.377.96ACM70.200.11ADP1wax/dgatΩKm0.650.17E. coliXL1-BluepBluescript KS−0.110.11pKS::wax/dgat84.519.37pBluescript SK−0.100.10pSK::wdh32690.650.31S17–1pBBR1MCS-20.110.10pBBR1MCS-2::wax/dgat99.2025.03P. citronellolispBBR1MCS-20.100.10pBBR1MCS-2::wax/dgat76.4626.69M. smegmatismc2155106.5496.44R. opacusPD630pBBRKmNC9039.596.66pBBRKmNC903-12.2910.73pSK::wdh3269 Open table in a new tab Heterologous expression of wax/dgatconferred the capability to recombinant E. coli XL1-Blue harboring pKS::wax/dgat to catalyze the acyl-CoA-dependent acylation of fatty alcohol as well as of diacylglycerol (Fig. 2 A) at rates similar to those of A. calcoaceticus ADP1 (Table I). These results clearly show that both, WS and DGAT activity, arise fromwax/dgat, which therefore codes for a bifunctional WS/DGAT enzyme. Furthermore, the experiments with the knock-out mutant indicate that no other protein exhibiting WS or DGAT activity contributes significantly to wax ester or TAG biosynthesis inA. calcoaceticus ADP1. This was supported by the fact that no other wax/dgat homologue could be identified by a BLAST (34Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) search in the preliminary A. calcoaceticusADP1 genome sequence data accessible online at www.genoscope.fr. However, residual trace amounts of TAGs accumulated in the mutants indicate the presence of a minor alternative pathway, which is, however, only active at a very low rate. Furthermore, functional heterologous expression of wax/dgat was not only demonstrated in E. coli S17-1 but also in P. citronellolis (Table I). The bifunctional WS/DGAT comprises 458 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 51.8 kDa. The basic theoretical pI of 9.05 is consistent with those observed for the jojoba WS (22Lardizabal K.D. Metz J.G. Sakamoto T. Hutton W.C. Pollard M.R. Lassner M.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 645-655Google Scholar) and other lipid biosynthetic enzymes (35Coleman J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 232: 295-303Google Scholar). It is a rather amphiphilic protein, and it possesses one putative predicted membrane-spanning region (Fig.2 C). A broad range of long-chain fatty alcohols could be utilized by the bifunctional enzyme as acyl acceptor in the WS reaction with lower specificities toward longer chain length (Fig.3 A). Whereas the WS reaction accepted a wide range of various chain length acyl-CoA molecules almost equally, the DGAT reaction preferred longer chain length acyl-CoAs (Fig. 3, B and C). Kinetic studies on the bifunctional enzyme by monitoring the formation of radiolabeled reaction products as a function of time revealed no obvious lag phase and approximately constant WS and DGAT reaction rates over a period of 40 min (Fig. 4 A). Recording the dependence of enzyme activities on palmitoyl-CoA concentration, hyperbolic saturation curves were obtained indicating that the bifunctional WS/DGAT does not behave as an allosteric enzyme (Fig. 4 B). Assuming substrate saturation for 1-hexadecanol and dipalmitin under assay conditions, Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis revealed K m values for palmitoyl-CoA of 15.6 and 21.1 μm and V max of 212.8 and 54.3 pmol (mg min)−1 for WS and DGAT reactions, respectively. In direct competition experiments, in which dipalmitin and hexadecanol were provided together at various concentrations, the WS/DGAT exhibited a considerably higher substrate specificity toward 1-hexadecanol in comparison to dipalmitin, which explains the rather low DGAT activity compared with the WS activity (Fig.5).Figure 4Enzyme kinetics of the bifunctional WS/DGAT.

During cultivation ofP. citronellolis(pBBR1MCS-2::wax/dgat) under storage conditions, no accumulation of wax esters could be detected by TLC if 0.5% (w/v) gluconate, 0.3% (w/v) 1-hexadecane, or 0.3% (w/v) palmitate were used as carbon sources (data not shown). However, cultivation on 0.3% (w/v) 1-hexadecanol, which can serve as a direct substrate for the WS, resulted in recombinant production of wax esters (Fig.6 B). No TAG accumulation could be observed under either condition. The A. calcoaceticus ADP1 WS/DGAT exhibits no sequence similarity to any known acyltransferase including the WS from jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) (22Lardizabal K.D. Metz J.G. Sakamoto T. Hutton W.C.

A BLAST search comprising 189 eubacterial and 18 archaeal finished and unfinished microbial genome sequences (as of November 2002) publicly accessible via the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) revealed that WS/DGAT-related proteins are not widely distributed among prokaryotes. Aside from the Gram-negative bacterium A. calcoaceticus, related proteins were found only in some actinomycetes, and interestingly within all members of the genusMycobacterium (Table III). Whereas only one gene coding for WS/DGAT occurs in A. calcoaceticus ADP1, numerous genes for related proteins were found in mycobacteria (Table III). These WS/DGAT-related proteins constitute a remarkable large group of conserved proteins in Mycobacterium with an up to now unknown function. M. tuberculosis H37Rv, for instance, possesses 13 genes coding for WS/DGAT-related proteins exhibiting up to 39.7% identity with the A. calcoaceticus enzyme (TableII), i.e. 1.43% of the 912 genes encoding conserved hypothetical proteins and 0.86% of all 1518 genes with unknown function in this strain (36Cole S.T.

The gene with the highest similarity exhibits 41.0% amino acid identity to WS/DGAT (Table II). Recombinant E. coliexpressing this gene on plasmid pSK::wdh3269 showed weak WS and DGAT activity, which was slightly but reproducible higher than the vector control (Table I). R. opacus PD630 is a TAG-accumulating actinomycete (3Alvarez H.M. Kalscheuer R. Steinbüchel A. Fett/Lipid. 1997; 9: 239-246Google Scholar), which itself exhibits WS and DGAT activity, but heterologous expression of wdh3269 clearly elevated both activities in this strain (Table I). M. smegmatis mc2155 cultivated under storage conditions with glucose as sole carbon source exhibited both high WS as well as DGAT activity in vitro (Table I), although in vivo only TAGs were intracellularly accumulated (Fig.6 A). However, M. smegmatis mc2155 was also capable of substantial wax ester biosynthesis in vivo when 1-hexadecanol was provided as a sole carbon source or as a cosubstrate (Fig. 6 A). The A. calcoaceticus ADP1 WS/DGAT and the related proteins inMycobacterium and A. thaliana exhibit in their N-terminal region partial similarity to a conserved condensing domain found in many multidomain enzymes synthesizing peptide antibiotics (NCBI Conserved Domain Data Base accession pfam00668). This condensing domain contains an active-site motif (HHXXXDG), whose second histidine residue is strictly conserved and has been demonstrated to be essential for catalytic activity in non-ribosomal peptide bond formation (38Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Google Scholar). The WS/DGAT and related proteins also contain this putative active site with the motif (133HXXXDG138) being strictly conserved (Fig. 2 B). Thus, it is very likely that this site is catalytically participating in the acyl-CoA acyltransferase reactions involved in wax ester and TAG formation (Fig.2 A). TAGs and wax esters are rather uncommon storage lipids in bacteria. Large amounts of TAG accumulation has been reported particularly for actinomycetes (2Barksdale L. Kim K.S. Bacteriol. Rev. 1977; 41: 217-372Google Scholar, 3Alvarez H.M. Kalscheuer R. Steinbüchel A. Fett/Lipid. 1997; 9: 239-246Google Scholar, 4Olukoshi E.R. Packter N.M. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 931-943Google Scholar), whereas wax esters occur frequently among species of the genus Acinetobacter, which are able to accumulate wax esters of up to 14% of the cellular dry weight depending on the culture conditions (5Fixter L.M. Nagi M. McCormack J.G. Fewson C.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 3147-3157Google Scholar). The A. calcoaceticus strain ADP1 synthesizes both classes of storage lipids under growth-limiting conditions. In the present study we identified a novel bifunctional enzyme from this strain, which mediates the final reaction steps in the biosynthesis of both lipids simultaneously. This bifunctional WS/DGAT is a new and unique type of long-chain acyltransferase, which is not related to members of the DGAT1 and 2 families or phospholipid:DAG acyltransferases mediating TAG synthesis, or to the jojoba WS, or to any other known gene in the data base. The residual trace amounts of TAGs, which are still present in the mutants, indicate that there might be an alternative low-rate pathway for TAG synthesis. Multiple alternative TAG biosynthesis pathways have been reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where a DGAT, a phospholipid:DAG acyltransferase, and the DGAT side-activity of a sterol:acyl-CoA acyltransferase contribute cumulatively at various rates to TAG synthesis (15Sandager L. Gustavsson M.H. Ståhl U. Dahlqvist A. Wiberg E. Banas A. Lenman M. Ronne H. Stymne S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6478-6482Google Scholar). In the preliminary A. calcoaceticus ADP1 genome sequence; however, no gene similar to those mentioned could be identified by BLAST search that could be a candidate for residual TAG synthesis. The highly conserved motif HHXXXDG corresponding to amino acids 132–138 of the A. calcoaceticus ADP1 WS/DGAT (Fig.2 B) may be the catalytic site responsible for ester bond formation. In analogy to the mechanism of non-ribosomal peptide bond formation catalyzed by condensing domains, which also contain this putative active site motif (38Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Google Scholar), a proposed catalytic mechanism for the WS/DGAT could involve abstraction of a proton from the hydroxyl group of the fatty alcohol or DAG, respectively, by the strictly conserved histidine residue His133 acting as base catalyst, which would than enable the nucleophilic attack on the thioester bond of the fatty acyl-CoA molecule (see Fig. 2 A). Beside the genus Acinetobacter, WS/DGAT-related proteins seem to be restricted almost exclusively to mycobacteria among prokaryotes (Table III). Whereas only one WS/DGAT gene is present inA. calcoaceticus ADP1, an extensive group of related proteins occurs in mycobacteria (Table III). Wax ester synthesis and WS activity in vitro have been reported for M. tuberculosis (39Wang L. Takayama K. Goldman D.S. Schnoes H.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 41-48Google Scholar), and TAG accumulation and DGAT activity have been shown for M. smegmatis (40Nakagawa H. Kashiwabara Y. Matsuki G. J. Biochem. 1976; 80: 923-928Google Scholar, 41Wun C.-K. Barakat H.A. Walker R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 488: 454-463Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated in addition in vitro WS activity (Table I) and in vivo wax ester production in M. smegmatismc2155 (Fig. 6 A). Until this study, however, no proteins or genes had been reported to which these activities could be attributed. By heterologous functional expression of the homologue fromM. smegmatis mc2155, which exhibited the highest similarity to the A. calcoaceticus ADP1 WS/DGAT (wdh3269), in recombinant E. coli and R. opacus, it was unambiguously demonstrated that wdh3269 also codes for a bifunctional WS/DGAT. However, it is not known yet to what extent wdh3269 contributes to storage lipid accumulation in M. smegmatis mc2155. It is likely that the observed in vitro and in vivo WS and DGAT activities in this strain are the cumulative result of several WS/DGAT homologues. Alternatively to storage lipid synthesis, some of the WS/DGAT homologues could also participate in biosynthesis of other lipids like mycolic acids. Interestingly, only recently the first evidence for lipid accumulation in M. tuberculosis, in vivo, has been reported (42Garton N.J. Christensen H. Minnikin D.E. Adegbola R.A. Barer M.R. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2951-2958Google Scholar). By employing a combined staining method, the occurrence of substantial lipophilic intracellular inclusions in mycobacterial cells in sputum samples from patients with clinical tuberculosis was demonstrated, which indicates that lipid accumulation could be an essential factor participating in pathogenesis. Simply the large number of WS/DGAT-related proteins identified in mycobacteria already supposes an important function, and it is likely that a least some of them are involved in lipid accumulation in M. tuberculosis. Thus, detailed investigations on the biological function of these WS/DGAT homologous proteins and their importance for the pathogenesis of harmful mycobacteria seem to be worthwhile. Since they can be found almost exclusively within mycobacteria and are not widely distributed among other prokaryotes or eukaryotes, they could be an ideal therapeutical target for treatment of major global health problems caused by mycobacteria like tuberculosis. A large group of conserved hypothetical proteins similar to WS/DGAT was also found in A. thaliana (Table II). Members of the DGAT1 and 2 families were already described for this plant (11Routaboul J.M. Benning C. Bechtold N. Caboche M. Lepiniec L. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 831-840Google Scholar, 14Bouvier-Navé P. Benveniste P. Oelkers P. Sturley S.L. Schaller H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 85-96Google Scholar), thus the presence of WS/DGAT-related proteins could possibly indicate that acyl-CoA-dependent TAG synthesis is mediated in A. thaliana by three different non-related enzyme groups. It would also be conceivable that WS/DGAT homologues are involved in the biosynthesis of epicuticular wax esters. A strong demand exists for large-scale production of cheap jojoba-like wax esters, which have multiple commercial uses. Jojoba oil is the only alternative natural source of wax esters to sperm whale oil, which is used at a commercial scale, but the high production costs restrict its use currently on cosmetic applications. The jojoba WS could not be functionally expressed in microorganisms like E. coli andS. cerevisiae (22Lardizabal K.D. Metz J.G. Sakamoto T. Hutton W.C. Pollard M.R. Lassner M.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 645-655Google Scholar). In contrast, we have demonstrated that the A. calcoaceticus ADP1 WS/DGAT was active in different bacterial hosts. In P. citronellolis, the heterologous expression of WS/DGAT led to production of wax esters if a long-chain fatty alcohol was provided as a carbon source that also delivers fatty acyl-CoA during catabolism by the alkane degradation pathway. By variation of the fatty alcohol used as carbon source it should be possible to vary the composition of the produced wax esters, because the bifunctional enzyme can utilize a broad range of substrates (Fig.3). This study provides the basis for a potential microbial biotechnological production of cheap jojoba-like wax esters. We thank Toni Voelker and Kathryn D. Lardizabal for helpful discussions."

Fibrosis is characterized by an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, of which type I collagen predominates. Activation of the hepatic stellate cell (HSC),1 a perisinusoidal cell that resides in the liver in a quiescent state, is responsible for the increased synthesis and deposition of type I collagen in the liver. Following a fibrogenic stimulus, the HSC undergoes a complex activation process in which the cell changes from a quiescent vitamin A-storing cell to an activated myofibroblast-like cell, which proliferates and becomes fibrogenic (1Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Google Scholar, 2Eng F.J. Friedman S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G7-G11Google Scholar). An increase in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation occurs with HSC activation. Altered collagen synthesis, at both the mRNA and protein levels, is observed with a dramatic increase in type I collagen and smaller but significant increases in type III and IV collagens (3Maher J.J. Bissell D.M. Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 450-459Google Scholar, 4Friedman S.L. Rockey D.C. McGuire R.F. Maher J.J. Boyles J.K. Yamasaki G.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is the most potent proliferative cytokine for the HSC (1Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Google Scholar). Liver fibrosis is associated with an increase in PDGF protein expression and increased PDGF receptor expression (6Pinzani M. Marra F. Carloni V. Liver. 1998; 18: 2-13Google Scholar). PDGF receptors contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and, upon binding to its ligand, become autophosphorylated at tyrosine residues (7Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Google Scholar). PDGF has been shown to transmit proliferative signals in several cell types, including the HSC (8Friedman S.L. Authur M.J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1780-1785Google Scholar, 9Pinzani M. Gesualdo L. Sabbah G.M. Abboud H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 8: 1786-1793Google Scholar). The activated PDGF receptor acts as a high affinity binding site for several signaling molecules leading to activation of Ras, followed by activation of Raf, MEK, and ERK (10Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has a key role in the synergistic interaction between growth factor and integrin signaling pathways. FAK, a 125-kDa cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase, is a member of the focal adhesion family that mediates integrin-mediated signal transduction leading to a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion (11Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Google Scholar). PDGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (12Carloni V. Pinzani M. Giusti S. Romanelli R.G. Parola M. Bellomo G. Failli P.

Association of FAK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is stimulated by PDGF and is required for PDGF stimulation of HSC proliferation (13Marra F. Gentilini A. Pinzani M. Choudhury G.G.

Focal adhesion non-kinase (FAK-CD) represents a kinase-deficient splice variant of FAK that contains only the C-terminal portion of FAK and that can inhibit phosphorylation of endogenous FAK, therefore acting as a dominant-negative form of FAK (11Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Google Scholar, 15Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Google Scholar). PI3K represents another key signaling molecule that is recruited to the activated PDGF receptor (16Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 747-752Google Scholar). Activated PI3K generates several phosphoinositols, leading to Akt activation by phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (17Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 8: 965-1014Google Scholar). Activated Akt is considered a key downstream survival factor by stimulating cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (17Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 8: 965-1014Google Scholar). Akt is activated not only by growth factors that stimulate tyrosine kinase activity, but also by other signals that can activate PI3K, such as integrins and stimulators of G-protein-coupled receptors (18Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Google Scholar, 19Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Google Scholar, 20King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Google Scholar, 21Muraga C. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 275: 12069-12073Google Scholar). We report here that FAK, PI3K, and Akt are involved in transmitting proliferative signals induced by serum and PDGF in the HSC. We show that both serum and PDGF induce phosphorylation of FAK, PI3K, and Akt and that PI3K and Akt signal downstream of FAK in the HSC. Blocking either FAK or PI3K inhibits HSC adhesion and migration. We demonstrate that PI3K activation is important for both type I collagen mRNA and protein expression in the HSC. Inhibition of PI3K reduces secreted type I collagen protein expression, whereas the intracellular unprocessed collagen intermediates remain unchanged. Therefore, this signaling pathway is critical for HSC proliferation and type I collagen gene expression in the activated HSC. HSCs were purified from Sprague-Dawley rats (>400 g) by sequential digestion of the liver with Pronase and collagenase, followed by arabinogalactan gradient centrifugation as previously described (22Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251Google Scholar). HSC purity was assessed microscopically and by using the autofluorescence property of the stored retinoids in the HSC. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion staining. HSC populations were consistently found to be between 90 and 99% pure and 95% viable. HSCs were cultured on plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mm l-glutamine in a 95% air and 5% CO2humidified atmosphere. HSCs were activated by culturing on plastic for 7–14 days. The purity of culture-activated HSCs was assessed by immunohistochemistry using mouse anti-human smooth muscle α-actin (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). Ad5LacZ, which contains the β-galactosidase gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, was used as a control virus throughout this study. The Ad5FAK-CD virus contains the dominant-negative form of FAK (23Xu L.-H. Yang X. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30597-30604Google Scholar). The Ad5myrAkt and Ad5dnAkt viruses express activated and dominant-negative forms of Akt, respectively (24Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Google Scholar, 25Kotani K. Ogawa W. Hino Y. Kitamura T. Ueno H. Sano W. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21305-21312Google Scholar). Quiescent HSCs, 1 day after isolation (day 1), were infected with Ad5FAK-CD or Ad5LacZ at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 500 for 12 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. After infection, the medium was changed to fresh growth medium. For proliferation and apoptosis studies, culture-activated HSCs (day 15) were infected at m.o.i. = 500 in medium containing 0.2% FBS. After 12 h, the medium was changed to fresh medium containing 0.2% FBS, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h prior to performing the individual experiments. HSCs were seeded onto glass coverslips and infected with AdFAK-CD at m.o.i. = 500. After 24 h of infection, the coverslips were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol for 8 min. The methanol was removed, and the coverslips were air-dried at room temperature. Immunostaining was performed using the Dako Envision system peroxidase staining kit as directed by the manufacturer. Coverslips were washed once with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and then incubated with peroxidase-blocking reagent at room temperature for 5 min. Coverslips were gently washed with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and subsequently incubated with anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a 1:200 dilution in PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature for 10 min. Coverslips were washed and incubated with the peroxidase-labeled polymer at room temperature for 10 min and washed as described above. The substrate/chromogen solution was prepared according to the manufacture's protocol and incubated on the coverslips at room temperature for 10 min, and the slides were washed with water. The 3,3-diamino benzidine/enhancer solution was added, incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and then washed with water. The coverslips were counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s, rinsed well with water, and dried for 10 min. The slides were dehydrated with two 100% ethanol washes for 20 s each and finally with xylene for 20 s. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides and viewed microscopically. DNA synthesis was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. This assay was used to assess cell proliferation, as cell counts correlated with the results of the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay (data not shown). Culture-activated HSCs (7–10 days in culture) were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates in growth medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, the medium was changed to 0.2% FBS, and the cells were infected with either Ad5FAK-CD or Ad5LacZ at m.o.i. = 500. The medium was changed after 12 h to medium containing 0.2% FBS, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Afterward, the cells were incubated in medium containing 10 ng/ml human PDGF-BB (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 48 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine present during the last 24 h. At the end of the incubation, 10% trichloroacetic acid was added, and the cells were maintained on ice for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 0.2 n NaOH, and radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate and repeated at least three times. Cell migration was assessed by measuring the repair of a linear wound generated in a confluent monolayer of HSCs (26Rosenberg I.M. Goke M. Kanai M. Reinecker H.C. Podolsky D.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G824-G832Google Scholar). Parallel lines were drawn on the bottom of wells before plating the cells. A linear wound was generated in the monolayer of cells by scraping a sterile plastic pipette tip perpendicular to the lines. The distance between the wound and cell front was measured with a micrometer, using the lines on the bottom of the well as a reference, immediately after creating the wound and 24 h later. Activated HSCs were uninfected, infected with the Ad5LacZ or Ad5FAK-CD virus for 24 h before generating the wound, or treated with the PI3K inhibitor 25 μm LY294002 (Calbiochem) or vehicle (Me2SO) 30 min before generating the wound. To assure that wound closure represents migration and not cell proliferation, HSCs were treated with 2.5 μg/ml mitomycin C 2 h before creating the wound. Culture-activated HSCs were uninfected, infected with the Ad5LacZ or AdFAK-CD virus, or treated with 25 μm LY294002 or Me2SO. Twenty-four hours after infection or 30 min after LY294002 or Me2SO treatment, HSCs were detached from the culture dishes with trypsin, and the detached cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were replated on tissue culture dishes. Two hours after replating, the cells were washed twice with PBS to remove unattached cells, and the adherent cells were trypsinized and counted. HSCs were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min, and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Cell lysate (250 μg) was incubated with 30 μl of anti-FAK antibody (specific for the N terminus of FAK) and with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, boiled for 5 min in SDS buffer, and applied to standard 10% SDS-polyacrylamide protein gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll) using a Transblot apparatus in buffer containing 20 mm glycine and 20% methanol. The membrane was stained with 0.5% Ponceau S to assure equal loading of the gel and transfer of the proteins. The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 144 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) at room temperature for 45 min. Afterward, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody: anti-FAK polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA in TBS-T or anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) diluted 1:2000 in 1% BSA in TBS-T at room temperature for 45 min. The membrane was washed five times with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat or goat anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5000 in 1% BSA in TBS-T at room temperature for 30 min. The membrane was washed five times with TBS-T, and signals were detected using the ECL Western blot detection system kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Culture-activated HSCs were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.25% SDS. The cell lysate (500 μg) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PI3K p110β antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antigen-antibody immune complexes were captured with protein A/G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μmNa3VO4 in PBS; twice with 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm LiCl, and 100 μmNa3VO4; and twice with 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μmol/liter Na3VO4. The beads were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature and suspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA and 10 μl of 10 mm MgCl2 to which 10 μl of a 2 μm solution of phosphatidylinositol (Avanti, Pelham, AL) was added. The reaction was initiated by adding 5 μl of 440 μm ATP and 15 μl of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/ml), and the reaction mixture was incubated at 22 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 8 nHCl and 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, the lower phase was applied to TLC plates coated with 1% potassium oxalate, and the reaction products were separated in a TLC chamber containing chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (60:47:11.3:2) buffer. Following chromatography, the TLC plate was subjected to autoradiography to visualize the phosphorylated substrate. Cultured HSCs were washed with PBS, and the cells were lysed with protein sample buffer (100 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford method. Protein samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and 20 μg was applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used for collagen analysis). After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were stained with 0.5% Ponceau S to assure equal protein loading and transfer. The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% powdered milk in TBS-T. Afterward, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody: anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt or anti-total Akt polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk in TBS-T or anti-type I collagen polyclonal antibody (Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA). The membrane was washed four times with TBS-T for 15 min each wash and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody diluted 1:1000 for Akt and 1:5000 for collagen in 5% milk in TBS-T. The membrane was washed five times with TBS-T for 10 min each wash. Immunodetected proteins were visualized using the ECL assay kit. RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (27Rivera C.A. Bradford B.U. Hunt K.J. Adachi Y. Schrum L.W. Koop D.R. Burchardt E.-R. Rippe R. Thurman R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G200-G207Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were prepared for rat α1(I) collagen (27Rivera C.A. Bradford B.U. Hunt K.J. Adachi Y. Schrum L.W. Koop D.R. Burchardt E.-R. Rippe R. Thurman R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G200-G207Google Scholar) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (pTRI-GAPDH-Rat, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and mixed with 5 μg of total RNA. Protected fragments were analyzed on standard 6% sequencing gels. Following electrophoresis, bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (AmershamBiosciences). Proteins from the culture medium were precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 40% at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was suspended in 0.5m acetic acid. Aliquots of the protein sample were digested with 130 units of pepsin (Sigma), neutralized with 1.5 mTris-HCl (pH 8.8), and digested with 8 units of collagenase (Sigma), or protein sample buffer was added. Digestion reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were applied onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot analysis was performed for type I collagen as described above. Because homozygous FAK knockout mice are embryonic lethal (28Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Google Scholar), we needed to develop a novel strategy to assess the role of FAK in HSCs. To evaluate the effects of blocking FAK in activated HSCs, culture-activated rat HSCs were transduced with Ad5FAK-CD expressing a dominant-negative form of FAK (23Xu L.-H. Yang X. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30597-30604Google Scholar). The cells were immunostained 24 h after transduction for the hemagglutinin epitope present on the FAK-CD protein. At m.o.i. = 500, >90% of the cells expressed the hemagglutinin-tagged FAK-CD protein (data not shown). To determine whether the dominant-negative FAK-CD protein effectively inhibits FAK phosphorylation, culture-activated HSCs were transduced with either Ad5FAK-CD or control Ad5LacZ. Total cell protein was harvested 48 h after infection and immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody (recognizing the N-terminal portion of FAK). Immunoprecipitated complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting for anti-FAK or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The FAK-CD protein effectively reduced the level of endogenous FAK protein in activated HSCs and inhibited the level of phosphorylated endogenous FAK (Fig.1). The dual effects of down-regulating both FAK protein levels and FAK phosphorylation by FAK-CD have been observed in other cell types (23Xu L.-H. Yang X. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30597-30604Google Scholar). To determine whether FAK has a role in cell proliferation in culture-activated HSCs, we assessed [3H]thymidine incorporation following Ad5FAK-CD transduction. Following Ad5FAK-CD transduction and a 24-h period of serum starvation, HSC proliferation was stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Ad5FAK-CD inhibited DNA synthesis in culture-activated HSCs by 49 ± 0.2% (Fig.2). Because PI3K is a common downstream target of FAK, we assessed the role of PI3K in PDGF-induced HSC proliferation. Culture-activated HSCs were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with 25 μm LY294002, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K, or vehicle (Me2SO). Cells were treated with LY294002 for 1 h and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB. LY294002 treatment blocked DNA synthesis by 70.2 ± 0.17% in culture-activated HSCs compared with control cells. FAK is involved in cell adhesion (11Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Google Scholar). To determine the role of FAK in adhesion of HSCs, we assayed HSC attachment after trypsinizing and replating the cells following Ad5FAK-CD transduction. Blocking FAK with the FAK-CD protein inhibited HSC adhesion by 72.6 ± 3.7% (Fig. 3 A). Treating the cells with 25 μm LY294002 also inhibited cell attachment by 76 ± 4.0% (Fig. 3 A). Cell migration of culture-activated HSCs was assessed by measuring the repair of a linear wound generated in a confluent monolayer of activated HSCs. Culture-activated HSCs were transduced with Ad5FAK-CD prior to generating the wound in a cell monolayer. Blocking FAK activity inhibited migration of HSCs by 64.7 ± 8.2% compared with transduced control cells (Fig. 3 B). Incubation of culture-activated HSCs with 25 μm LY294002 also inhibited cell migration by 58.7 ± 9.4% compared with cells treated with vehicle (Me2SO) (Fig. 3 B). To assure that wound closure represents cell migration and not a proliferative response, HSCs were treated with 2.5 μm mitomycin C, an inhibitor of cell proliferation, 2 h prior to generating the wound. Treatment of the cells with mitomycin C did not affect wound closure, thus demonstrating that the response measured cell migration and not cell proliferation. Together, these data show that blocking either FAK or PI3K inhibits cell adhesion and migration of HSCs. Inhibiting FAK or PI3K results in similar effects on HSC DNA synthesis, cell adhesion, and cell migration, suggesting that these signaling molecules are jointly involved in the cellular signaling cascade meditating these cellular events. Therefore, we wanted to determine whether PI3K acts downstream of FAK in HSC signaling. Culture-activated HSCs were transduced with either Ad5FAK-CD or Ad5LacZ or treated with 25 μm LY294002. The cells were subsequently serum-starved to reduce their proliferation rate and then induced to proliferate with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Total cell protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-PI3K antibody, and PI3K assays were performed. The control Ad5LacZ virus did not affect PI3K activity; however, infection with Ad5FAK-CD markedly inhibited PI3K activity (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that PI3K acts downstream of FAK in PDGF-stimulated HSC signaling. Akt has been implicated as a signaling molecule in several cell types and is positioned downstream of PI3K. Because both serum and PDGF stimulated HSC proliferation, we assessed whether serum and PDGF can induce Akt phosphorylation. Culture-activated HSCs were serum-starved for 48 h and pretreated for 1 h with 25 μmLY294002 prior to treatment with either 10% serum or 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Cells were harvested 10, 20, 30, and 60 min following stimulation, and Akt phosphorylation status was assessed by Western blot analysis. Within 10 min of serum (Fig.5 A) or PDGF-BB (Fig.5 B) stimulation, phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 was observed, indicating Akt activation. Interestingly, Akt phosphorylation levels began to diminish 60 min following serum stimulation. Pretreatment of the cells with 25 μm LY294002 completely inhibited both serum- and PDGF-induced Akt phosphorylation at each time point. To assure equal protein loading, total Akt levels were assessed and found to be similar (Fig. 5). To assess the role of Akt in HSC proliferation, culture-activated HSCs were either transduced with Ad5myrAkt or Ad5dnAkt or treated with LY294002. Afterward, the cells were serum-starved for 48 h and then stimulated to proliferate with 10% serum. The dominant-negative form of Akt and LY294002 treatment inhibited serum-induced HSC DNA synthesis by 72.6 and 92.7%, respectively (Fig.6). Overexpression of the constitutively active form of Akt stimulated HSC DNA synthesis to levels equal to 10% serum (Fig. 6). LY294002 treatment markedly inhibited HSC DNA synthesis. Cell counts (data not shown) showed similar results, indicating that PI3K and Akt are involved in transmitting proliferative signals in the HSC. Because we demonstrated that PI3K signals downstream of FAK (Fig. 4), we wanted to determine whether Akt also signals downstream of FAK following PDGF-induced stimulation in activated HSCs. Culture-activated HSCs were transduced with either Ad5FAK-CD or Ad5LacZ. The cells were serum-starved to reduce their proliferation rate. After 48 h, the cells were induced to proliferate with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Cells were harvested after 20 min of PDGF stimulation, and Western blot analysis was performed for phospho-Akt. The control Ad5LacZ virus did not affect PDGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt; however, infection with Ad5FAK-CD inhibited PDGF-induced Akt phosphorylation by 37% (Fig. 7). No changes were observed in total Akt levels (Fig. 7). These data demonstrate that Akt signals downstream of FAK in PDGF-stimulated HSC signaling. TGF-β has previously been shown to inhibit HSC proliferation (29Bachem M.G. Riess U. Gressner A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 708-714Google Scholar, 30Saile B. Mathes N. Knittel T. Ramadori G. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 196-202Google Scholar). We wanted to determine whether TGF-β inhibits HSC proliferation at the level of Akt phosphorylation following PDGF stimulation. Culture-activated HSCs were serum-starved for 48 h and then treated under five different conditions: 1) 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 1 h, 2) 20 ng/ml PDGF for 20 min, 3) 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 1 h and then 20 ng/ml PDGF for 20 min, 4) 5 ng/ml TGF-β together with 20 ng/ml PDGF for 20 min, and 5) pretreatment with 20 ng"
https://openalex.org/W2057916223,"Leucine-rich repeat-containing, G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) represent a unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors with a large ectodomain. Recent studies demonstrated that relaxin activates two orphan LGRs, LGR7 and LGR8, whereas INSL3/Leydig insulin-like peptide specifically activates LGR8. Human relaxin 3 (H3 relaxin) was recently discovered as a novel ligand for relaxin receptors. Here, we demonstrate that H3 relaxin activates LGR7 but not LGR8. Taking advantage of the overlapping specificity of these three ligands for the two related LGRs, chimeric receptors were generated to elucidate the mechanism of ligand activation of LGR7. Chimeric receptor LGR7/8 with the ectodomain from LGR7 but the transmembrane region from LGR8 maintains responsiveness to relaxin but was less responsive to H3 relaxin based on ligand stimulation of cAMP production. The decreased ligand signaling was accompanied by decreases in the ability of H3 relaxin to compete for 33P-relaxin binding to the chimeric receptor. However, replacement of the exoloop 2, but not exoloop 1 or 3, of LGR7 to the chimeric LGR7/8 restored ligand binding and receptor-mediated cAMP production. These results suggested that activation of LGR7 by H3 relaxin involves specific binding of the ligand to both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2, thus providing a model with which to understand the molecular basis of ligand signaling for this unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors.

These two receptors, LGR7 and LGR8, share 50% sequence identity to each other, and contain a unique low density lipoprotein receptor-like cysteine-rich motif at the amino terminus. However, LGR7 and LGR8 do not have the consensus hinge region found in gonadotropin and thyrotropin receptors. In contrast to relaxin, INSL3 activates LGR8 but not LGR7; interactions between INSL3 and LGR8 were demonstrated by ligand-receptor cross-linking (7Kumagai J. Hsu S.Y. Matsumi H. Roh J.S. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31283-31286Google Scholar).In addition to the two known human relaxin genes, H1 (8Hudson P. Haley J. John M. Cronk M. Crawford R. Haralambidis J. Tregear G. Shine J. Niall H. Nature. 1983; 301: 628-631Google Scholar) andH2 (9Hudson P. John M. Crawford R. Haralambidis J. Scanlon D. Gorman J. Tregear G. Shine J. Niall H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2333-2339Google Scholar), another related gene, designated H3 relaxin (H3), was identified recently. A synthetic peptide with a design based on this gene was found to possess relaxin activity in bioassays using the human monocyte cell line, THP-1 (10Bathgate R.A. Samuel C.S. Burazin T.C. Layfield S. Claasz A.A. Reytomas I.G. Dawson N.F. Zhao C. Bond C. Summers R.J. Parry L.J. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1148-1157Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that H3 relaxin activates recombinant LGR7 but not LGR8. Taking advantage of the structural similarity of LGR7 and LGR8, and the differential specificity of relaxin-related peptides to these receptors, we designed chimeric LGR7/LGR8 receptors to identify the domains in the receptor that are important for their ligand specificity. We demonstrate that both the ectodomain and exoloop 2 of LGR7 are important for ligand receptor binding and signaling.DISCUSSIONRecent studies demonstrated that porcine relaxin activates LGR7, and, with lower efficacy, LGR8. In addition, INSL3 is a specific and more potent ligand for LGR8 than relaxin (6Hsu S.Y. Nakabayashi K. Nishi S. Kumagai J. Kudo M. Sherwood O.D. Hsueh A.J. Science. 2002; 295: 671-674Google Scholar, 7Kumagai J. Hsu S.Y. Matsumi H. Roh J.S. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31283-31286Google Scholar). The present data indicate that relaxin H3 is a specific ligand for LGR7 but not LGR8. However, relaxin H3 is less potent than porcine relaxin or H2 relaxin in activating LGR7.Taking advantage of the structural similarity between LGR7 and LGR8, and because leucine-rich repeats in the ectodomain have been postulated to be important for protein-protein interactions (22Jiang X. Dreano M. Buckler D.R. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W.A. el Tayar N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1341-1353Google Scholar, 23Kajava A.V. Vassart G. Wodak S.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 867-877Google Scholar, 24Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Google Scholar), we designed chimeric constructs to investigate the importance of the ectodomain of these receptors in ligand signaling. Similar to wild type LGR7, LGR7/8 responded to porcine relaxin and H2 relaxin stimulation, whereas neither LGR7 nor LGR7/8 responded to treatment with INSL3. Although treatment with H3 relaxin in cells expressing LGR7/8 led to dose-dependent increases in cAMP production, this chimeric receptor was less responsive to H3 relaxin as compared with the wild type LGR7. Further analyses of competition data based on ligand-receptor binding also indicated that the chimeric receptor LGR7/8 showed lower affinity for H3 relaxin. These results suggest that, in addition to the ectodomain, the transmembrane region of LGR7 plays an important role for optimal H3 relaxin binding and activation of LGR7. We further demonstrated that replacement of exoloop 2 of LGR7 in the chimeric receptor LGR7/8 completely restored receptor binding and cAMP production. In contrast, LGR7/8(EL1) or LGR7/8(EL3) showed similar EC50 and IC50 values for LGR7/8. These results indicate that exoloop 2, but not exoloop 1 or 3, is responsible for H3 relaxin binding to the receptor and optimal signal transduction.In the human genome, there are seven peptide hormones belonging to the relaxin family, all with the putative two-chain, three cysteine-bounded structure. The homology between the A- and B-chain of H1 and H2 relaxin is 62 and 85%, respectively. These two hormones show similar biological activity. H2 relaxin is expressed in the corpus luteum and is the major circulating form (25Winslow J.W. Shih A. Bourell J.H. Weiss G. Reed B. Stults J.T. Goldsmith L.T. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2660-2668Google Scholar), whereas the expression of H1 relaxin is restricted to decidua, trophoblasts, and prostate (26Hansell D.J. Bryant-Greenwood G.D. Greenwood F.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 72: 899-904Google Scholar). The distinctive RXXXRXX(I/V) motif in the B-chain of H1 and H2 relaxin is believed to be the contact site for receptor binding (27Bullesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Google Scholar). Although the paralogous INSL3 produced by the testis and ovary (4Nef S. Parada L.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 295-299Google Scholar, 5Ivell R. Bathgate R.A. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 699-705Google Scholar) is a specific ligand for LGR8, another human paralog relaxin 3, designated as H3 relaxin, has the RXXXRXXI motif in the B-chain and stimulates cAMP production by THP-1 cells expressing the relaxin receptors (10Bathgate R.A. Samuel C.S. Burazin T.C. Layfield S. Claasz A.A. Reytomas I.G. Dawson N.F. Zhao C. Bond C. Summers R.J. Parry L.J. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1148-1157Google Scholar). The distribution of H3 relaxin in human tissues is unknown; however, the predominant site of relaxin 3 expression in rodents is the brain (10Bathgate R.A. Samuel C.S. Burazin T.C. Layfield S. Claasz A.A. Reytomas I.G. Dawson N.F. Zhao C. Bond C. Summers R.J. Parry L.J. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1148-1157Google Scholar,28Burazin T.C. Bathgate R.A. Macris M. Layfield S. Gundlach A.L. Tregear G.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1553-1557Google Scholar). H3 relaxin is believed to be a neuropeptide that activates its receptor in neuronal synapses (28Burazin T.C. Bathgate R.A. Macris M. Layfield S. Gundlach A.L. Tregear G.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1553-1557Google Scholar), thus being consistent with its lower efficacy in activating recombinant LGR7 as compared with the more potent endocrine hormone H2 relaxin.The known LGRs from vertebrates and invertebrates can be divided into three distinct subgroups based on phylogenetic analysis. The first subgroup contains the mammalian gonadotropin and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors, fly LGR1, and LGRs from sea anemone andCaenorhabditis elegans, whereas the second subgroup consists of mammalian orphan receptors LGR4, LGR5, and LGR6, as well as fly LGR2 (29Hsu S.Y. Liang S.G. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1830-1845Google Scholar, 30Nishi S. Hsu S.Y. Zell K. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4081-4090Google Scholar). The third group of LGRs, including mammalian LGR7 and LGR8 as well as snail LGR (13Hsu S.Y. Kudo M. Chen T. Nakabayashi K. Bhalla A. van der Spek P.J. van Duin M. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1257-1271Google Scholar), is distinct from the other groups in that it has the unique low density lipoprotein receptor-like cysteine-rich motifs in the amino terminus but is missing the typical hinge region known to be important for gonadotropin and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor activation (31Nakabayashi K. Kudo M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30264-30271Google Scholar).At least three steps are involved in the ligand signaling of glycoprotein hormone receptors, each probably requiring unique but overlapping domains (31Nakabayashi K. Kudo M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30264-30271Google Scholar, 32Duprez L. Parma J. Costagliola S. Hermans J. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 469-474Google Scholar, 33Zeng H. Phang T. Song Y.S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3451-3458Google Scholar, 34Nishi S. Nakabayashi K. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3958-3964Google Scholar). First, the heterodimeric ligands interact with the ectodomain of the receptor, consisting of leucine-rich repeats that could form a 1/3-donut structure important for ligand-interaction. Second, ligand binding leads to the disruption of the constraint on the transmembrane region exerted by the interactions between the ectodomain (likely the hinge region) and exoloop 2. Third, the relaxed transmembrane region, as the result of ligand binding, interacts with the Gs protein to activate the adenyl cyclase. In this model, it is likely that the common α-subunit of the glycoprotein hormones interacts with the leucine-rich repeats of the receptor ectodomains, whereas the unique β-subunits of these ligands stabilize the ligand-receptor complex by binding to the exoloops (33Zeng H. Phang T. Song Y.S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3451-3458Google Scholar). Due to the lack of a hinge region in LGR7 and LGR8 comparable to those found in glycoprotein hormone receptors, it is unclear whether the ectodomains of these relaxin receptors are capable of constraining their transmembrane region similar to glycoprotein hormone receptors.Although the present studies using chimeric receptors and the soluble ectodomain of LGR7 suggest an important role for the ectodomain in ligand-receptor binding and signal transduction, our data demonstrate that H3 relaxin binds to both the ectodomain and exoloop 2 of LGR7 to induce maximal signal transduction. We propose a model for the activation of LGR7 by H3 relaxin (Fig.7). First, H3 relaxin binds to the ectodomain of LGR7 through the putative contact motif RXXXRXX(I/V) (Fig. 7 A). This interaction could be blocked by the soluble ectodomain of LGR7. Subsequently, H3 relaxin also binds to exoloop 2 of LGR7 to stabilize the ligand-receptor complexes (Fig. 7 B). Binding of H3 relaxin to both regions of LGR7 evokes efficient receptor activation by interacting with the Gs protein and stimulating cAMP production (Fig.7 C). Because LGR7 and LGR8 show 59% homology in exoloop 2, H2 relaxin could interact with the consensus sequence of these receptors and the present model could apply to the H2 relaxin.In conclusion, we demonstrate that H3 relaxin is a specific ligand for LGR7, and using chimeric receptors, H3 relaxin is shown to bind both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2 for the activation of its receptor. Further studies using chimeric LGR7 and LGR8 receptors could provide useful information regarding the mechanism of receptor activation by H2 relaxin and INSL3 and aid in the understanding the structural-functional relationship between ligands and receptors for this unique group of G protein-coupled receptors. Relaxin and Leydig insulin-like peptide/relaxin-like factor (INSL3)1 are peptide hormones with a two-chain structure similar to that of insulin (1Bedarkar S. Turnell W.G. Blundell T.L. Schwabe C. Nature. 1977; 270: 449-451Google Scholar, 2Isaacs N. James R. Niall H. Bryant-Greenwood G. Dodson G. Evans A. North A.C. Nature. 1978; 271: 278-281Google Scholar). Relaxin is important for the function of reproductive tissues, heart, kidney, and brain (3Sherwood O.D. Knobil E. Neill J.D. 2nd Ed. The Physiology of Reproduction. 1. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 861-1009Google Scholar), whereas INSL3 is essential for testis descent (4Nef S. Parada L.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 295-299Google Scholar, 5Ivell R. Bathgate R.A. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 699-705Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that two orphan leucine-rich repeat-containing, G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) with homology to gonadotropin and thyrotropin receptors, are capable of mediating the action of relaxin through a cAMP-dependent pathway (6Hsu S.Y. Nakabayashi K. Nishi S. Kumagai J. Kudo M. Sherwood O.D. Hsueh A.J. Science. 2002; 295: 671-674Google Scholar). These two receptors, LGR7 and LGR8, share 50% sequence identity to each other, and contain a unique low density lipoprotein receptor-like cysteine-rich motif at the amino terminus. However, LGR7 and LGR8 do not have the consensus hinge region found in gonadotropin and thyrotropin receptors. In contrast to relaxin, INSL3 activates LGR8 but not LGR7; interactions between INSL3 and LGR8 were demonstrated by ligand-receptor cross-linking (7Kumagai J. Hsu S.Y. Matsumi H. Roh J.S. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31283-31286Google Scholar). In addition to the two known human relaxin genes, H1 (8Hudson P. Haley J. John M. Cronk M. Crawford R. Haralambidis J. Tregear G. Shine J. Niall H. Nature. 1983; 301: 628-631Google Scholar) andH2 (9Hudson P. John M. Crawford R. Haralambidis J. Scanlon D. Gorman J. Tregear G. Shine J. Niall H.

H2 relaxin is expressed in the corpus luteum and is the major circulating form (25Winslow J.W. Shih A. Bourell J.H. Weiss G. Reed B. Stults J.T. Goldsmith L.T. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2660-2668Google Scholar), whereas the expression of H1 relaxin is restricted to decidua, trophoblasts, and prostate (26Hansell D.J. Bryant-Greenwood G.D. Greenwood F.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 72: 899-904Google Scholar). The distinctive RXXXRXX(I/V) motif in the B-chain of H1 and H2 relaxin is believed to be the contact site for receptor binding (27Bullesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35276-35280Google Scholar). Although the paralogous INSL3 produced by the testis and ovary (4Nef S. Parada L.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 295-299Google Scholar, 5Ivell R. Bathgate R.A. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 699-705Google Scholar) is a specific ligand for LGR8, another human paralog relaxin 3, designated as H3 relaxin, has the RXXXRXXI motif in the B-chain and stimulates cAMP production by THP-1 cells expressing the relaxin receptors (10Bathgate R.A. Samuel C.S. Burazin T.C. Layfield S. Claasz A.A. Reytomas I.G. Dawson N.F. Zhao C. Bond C. Summers R.J. Parry L.J. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1148-1157Google Scholar). The distribution of H3 relaxin in human tissues is unknown; however, the predominant site of relaxin 3 expression in rodents is the brain (10Bathgate R.A. Samuel C.S. Burazin T.C. Layfield S. Claasz A.A. Reytomas I.G. Dawson N.F. Zhao C. Bond C. Summers R.J. Parry L.J. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1148-1157Google Scholar,28Burazin T.C. Bathgate R.A. Macris M. Layfield S. Gundlach A.L. Tregear G.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1553-1557Google Scholar). H3 relaxin is believed to be a neuropeptide that activates its receptor in neuronal synapses (28Burazin T.C. Bathgate R.A. Macris M. Layfield S. Gundlach A.L. Tregear G.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1553-1557Google Scholar), thus being consistent with its lower efficacy in activating recombinant LGR7 as compared with the more potent endocrine hormone H2 relaxin. The known LGRs from vertebrates and invertebrates can be divided into three distinct subgroups based on phylogenetic analysis. The first subgroup contains the mammalian gonadotropin and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors, fly LGR1, and LGRs from sea anemone andCaenorhabditis elegans, whereas the second subgroup consists of mammalian orphan receptors LGR4, LGR5, and LGR6, as well as fly LGR2 (29Hsu S.Y. Liang S.G. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1830-1845Google Scholar, 30Nishi S. Hsu S.Y. Zell K. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4081-4090Google Scholar). The third group of LGRs, including mammalian LGR7 and LGR8 as well as snail LGR (13Hsu S.Y. Kudo M. Chen T. Nakabayashi K. Bhalla A. van der Spek P.J. van Duin M. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1257-1271Google Scholar), is distinct from the other groups in that it has the unique low density lipoprotein receptor-like cysteine-rich motifs in the amino terminus but is missing the typical hinge region known to be important for gonadotropin and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor activation (31Nakabayashi K. Kudo M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30264-30271Google Scholar). At least three steps are involved in the ligand signaling of glycoprotein hormone receptors, each probably requiring unique but overlapping domains (31Nakabayashi K. Kudo M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30264-30271Google Scholar, 32Duprez L. Parma J. Costagliola S. Hermans J. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 469-474Google Scholar, 33Zeng H. Phang T. Song Y.S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3451-3458Google Scholar, 34Nishi S. Nakabayashi K. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3958-3964Google Scholar). First, the heterodimeric ligands interact with the ectodomain of the receptor, consisting of leucine-rich repeats that could form a 1/3-donut structure important for ligand-interaction. Second, ligand binding leads to the disruption of the constraint on the transmembrane region exerted by the interactions between the ectodomain (likely the hinge region) and exoloop 2. Third, the relaxed transmembrane region, as the result of ligand binding, interacts with the Gs protein to activate the adenyl cyclase. In this model, it is likely that the common α-subunit of the glycoprotein hormones interacts with the leucine-rich repeats of the receptor ectodomains, whereas the unique β-subunits of these ligands stabilize the ligand-receptor complex by binding to the exoloops (33Zeng H. Phang T. Song Y.S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3451-3458Google Scholar). Due to the lack of a hinge region in LGR7 and LGR8 comparable to those found in glycoprotein hormone receptors, it is unclear whether the ectodomains of these relaxin receptors are capable of constraining their transmembrane region similar to glycoprotein hormone receptors. Although the present studies using chimeric receptors and the soluble ectodomain of LGR7 suggest an important role for the ectodomain in ligand-receptor binding and signal transduction, our data demonstrate that H3 relaxin binds to both the ectodomain and exoloop 2 of LGR7 to induce maximal signal transduction. We propose a model for the activation of LGR7 by H3 relaxin (Fig.7). First, H3 relaxin binds to the ectodomain of LGR7 through the putative contact motif RXXXRXX(I/V) (Fig. 7 A). This interaction could be blocked by the soluble ectodomain of LGR7. Subsequently, H3 relaxin also binds to exoloop 2 of LGR7 to stabilize the ligand-receptor complexes (Fig. 7 B). Binding of H3 relaxin to both regions of LGR7 evokes efficient receptor activation by interacting with the Gs protein and stimulating cAMP production (Fig.7 C). Because LGR7 and LGR8 show 59% homology in exoloop 2, H2 relaxin could interact with the consensus sequence of these receptors and the present model could apply to the H2 relaxin. In conclusion, we demonstrate that H3 relaxin is a specific ligand for LGR7, and using chimeric receptors, H3 relaxin is shown to bind both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2 for the activation of its receptor. Further studies using chimeric LGR7 and LGR8 receptors could provide useful information regarding the mechanism of receptor activation by H2 relaxin and INSL3 and aid in the understanding the structural-functional relationship between ligands and receptors for this unique group of G protein-coupled receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2152826290,"The apoptosome is a multiprotein complex comprising Apaf-1, cytochrome c, and caspase-9 that functions to activate caspase-3 downstream of mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals. Binding of cytochrome c and dATP to Apaf-1 in the cytosol leads to the assembly of a heptameric complex in which each Apaf-1 subunit is bound noncovalently to a procaspase-9 subunit via their respective CARD domains. Assembly of the apoptosome results in the proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-9 at the cleavage site PEPD315 to yield the large (p35) and small (p12) caspase-9 subunits. In addition to the PEPD site, caspase-9 contains a caspase-3 cleavage site (DQLD330), which when cleaved, produces a smaller p10 subunit in which the NH2-terminal 15 amino acids of p12, including the XIAP BIR3 binding motif, are removed. Using purified proteins in a reconstituted reaction in vitro, we have assessed the relative impact of Asp315and Asp330 cleavage on caspase-9 activity within the apoptosome. In addition, we characterized the effect of caspase-3 feedback cleavage of caspase-9 on the rate of caspase-3 activation, and the potential ramifications of Asp330 cleavage on XIAP-mediated inhibition of the apoptosome. We have found that cleavage of procaspase-9 at Asp330 to generate p35, p10 or p37, p10 forms resulted in a significant increase (up to 8-fold) in apoptosome activity compared with p35/p12. The significance of this increase was demonstrated by the near complete loss of apoptosome-mediated caspase-3 activity when a point mutant (D330A) of procaspase-9 was substituted for wild-type procaspase-9 in the apoptosome. In addition, cleavage at Asp330 exposed a novel p10 NH2-terminal peptide motif (AISS) that retained the ability to mediate XIAP inhibition of caspase-9. Thus, whereas feedback cleavage of caspase-9 by caspase-3 significantly increases the activity of the apoptosome, it does little to attenuate its sensitivity to inhibition by XIAP.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1023-1027Google Scholar, 2Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Google Scholar). Caspases are expressed in virtually all metazoan cells as catalytically inactive zymogens known as procaspases. Two mechanisms have been described for activating caspases: noncovalent association with caspase activating proteins (e.g. Fadd, Apaf-1) leading to autocatalytic cleavage of the procaspase polypeptide at specific aspartic acid residues, or cleavage at specific aspartic acid residues within the zymogen by other activated caspases. Caspases have been divided into initiators (caspases-2, -8, -9, and -10) and effectors (caspases-3, -6, and -7) based on their relative position within a caspase cascade (3Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

Initiator caspases are activated by the former mechanism, effector caspases by the latter. The combined proteolytic activities of initiator and effector caspases cleave a variety of vital protein substrates, including DFF45/ICAD, lamin B, gelsolin, Bid, and PAK2, leading to the morphological and biochemical characteristics of apoptosis (8Kothakota S.

Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Google Scholar).Caspase-9 is the initiator caspase in the “intrinsic” or mitochrondrial caspase pathway. Interaction of caspase-9 with Apaf-1, a human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans CED4 protein, to form the apoptosome occurs in response to cytochrome crelease from the mitochondria of pre-apoptotic cells (12Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Google Scholar). The apoptosome is a multiprotein complex comprised of Apaf-1, cytochromec, and caspase-9 in a 1:1:1 molar ratio (12Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Google Scholar, 13Purring C. Zou H. Wang X. McLendon G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7435-7436Google Scholar). The function of the apoptosome is to cleave and activate the apoptosis effector caspases-3, -6, and -7 (14Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Google Scholar, 29Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Google Scholar). The apoptosome is assembled when seven Apaf-1:cytochrome c heterodimers oligomerize to form a symmetrical “wheel” and procaspase-9 molecules become associated noncovalently to Apaf-1 via caspase-9 CARD/Apaf-1 CARD heterophilic interaction (15Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shim Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-559Google Scholar, 16Acehan D. Jiang X. Morgan D.G. Heuser J.E. Wang X. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 423-432Google Scholar). Binding of procaspase-9 to Apaf-1 is important for two reasons. First, it increases the intrinsic catalytic activity of the caspase-9 protease leading to the autolytic cleavage of procaspase-9 at Asp315 to yield a large (p35) and a small (p12) subunit (14Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Google Scholar, 17Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Google Scholar, 18Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Google Scholar). And second, cleavage exposes a neo-epitope comprising the NH2–terminal four amino acids (ATPF) of the small p12 subunit that has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for binding to the BIR3 domain of XIAP, leading to inhibition of caspase-9 (19Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chal J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Alnemri T.F. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Google Scholar). Once activated in the apoptosome, caspase-9 cleaves procaspase-3 at Asp175 and activates caspase-3. Studies in vitro (14Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Google Scholar, 29Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Google Scholar) and in intact cells (20Fujita E. Egashira J. Urase K. Kuida K. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 335-344Google Scholar) have shown that caspase-3 is capable of feedback cleavage of caspase-9 at Asp330, and that this cleavage is associated with an increase in apoptosome activity. Caspase-3-directed feedback cleavage of caspase-9 p35/p12 at Asp330 would remove the BIR3 recognition motif of caspase-9 (19Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chal J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Alnemri T.F. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Google Scholar), creating a caspase-9 species, p35/p10, which may be insensitive to XIAP inhibition.Using purified, recombinant Apaf-1, caspase-9, and caspase-3 the present study has addressed the regulation of the apoptosome at three levels. 1) Does caspase-9 cleavage affect apoptosome activity? 2) What is the impact of caspase-3-mediated feedback cleavage of caspase-9 on apoptosome activity? And 3) following feedback cleavage of caspase-9, what impact does the loss of the BIR3 binding motif from the linker region have on XIAP inhibition. Our results show that recombinant proteins can combine in a dATP- and cytochrome c-dependent manner to yield a catalytically active apoptosome capable of cleaving and activating recombinant procaspase-3. The data further demonstrate that association of procaspase-9 with Apaf-1 leads to a partial active apoptosome containing p35/p12 caspase-9. Activation of caspase-3 by the p35/p12-containing apoptosomes leads to the initiation of a feedback loop whereby caspase-3 cleaves caspase-9 at Asp330. Our data further demonstrate that p10-containing apoptosomes have enhanced catalytic properties relative to p12-containing species. Finally, our study identifies a novel motif at the NH2 terminus of the p10 subunit capable of mediating XIAP inhibition. Thus, whereas feedback cleavage of caspase-9 by caspase-3 significantly increases the proteolytic activity of the apoptosome, it does little to attenuate its sensitivity to inhibition by the endogenous caspase-9 inhibitor, XIAP.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have addressed the potential physiological role(s) of caspase-3-mediated feedback cleavage of caspase-9 using purified, recombinant Apaf-1, caspase-9, and caspase-3 proteins in a reconstituted apoptosome in vitro. Because caspase-9 can be cleaved by itself (Asp315) or by caspase-3 (Asp330), the combined action of the two proteases on procaspase-9 can produce three different caspase-9 enzymes: p35/p12, p37/p10, or p35/p10 (Fig. 1). We attempted to discriminate the role of each cleavage site by generating various recombinant caspase-9 species. First we generated procaspase-9 species in which each cleavage site had been eliminated alone or in combination and assessed their ability to activate procaspase-3. Second we produced all three processed forms of caspase-9, p35/p12, p37/p10, and p35/p10, and reconstituted them separately into the apoptosome to compare their relative catalytic activities and sensitivities to inhibition by the BIR3 domain of XIAP.Experiments in which procaspase-9 with cleavage mutations were used suggest that cleavage at Asp330 is required for full activation of the apoptosome (Fig. 2 C). This observation is inconsistent with previously published reports (17Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Google Scholar, 18Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Google Scholar, 19Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chal J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Alnemri T.F. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Google Scholar) in which little, if any, difference was observed in the ability of unprocessed and processed caspase-9 to cleave and activate procaspase-3. Although no definitive explanation for this discrepancy can be presented, there were significant differences in methodology between these previous reports and the present work. In general, the previous reports employed cellular extracts as the context for assessing relative activities of caspase-9, whereas the present work utilized recombinant proteins at defined concentrations and molar ratios. The use of cellular extracts may introduce additional cytosolic factors, including but not limited to endogenous procaspase-9 that may modulate apoptosome activity and obscure the potential impact of cleavage at Asp330.Cleavage of caspase-9 at Asp330 by caspase-3 increases the catalytic activity of caspase-9 in the apoptosome up to 8-fold. This is because of an increase in k cat and a decrease inK m of p10-containing forms of the apoptosome as measured by cleavage of the caspase-9 substrate LEHD-AMC (Table I). Thus, caspase-3 feedback cleavage of either p35/p12 (to generate p35/p10) or uncleaved procaspase-9 (to generate p37/p10) has the potential to amplify the proteolytic activity of the apoptosome. If operational in cells, this would create a feed-forward mechanism to accelerate the apoptotic destruction of the cell once the downstream effector caspase-3 has been activated. At least two recent studies support this possibility. Fujita et al. (20Fujita E. Egashira J. Urase K. Kuida K. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 335-344Google Scholar), using caspase-9 cleavage site-specific antibodies, demonstrated in living mouse cells a sequential cleavage of procaspase-9, first by caspase-9 and then by caspase-3. These authors also noted a correlation between cleavage at Asp330 and increased cellular caspase-9 activity. In a second study, Slee et al. (29Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Google Scholar) using cell-free extracts, have demonstrated a requirement for caspase-3 activity to achieve maximum apoptosome activity. The optimum activity in this study also correlated with the presence of an Asp330 cleavage product. Our data are consistent with these observations and provide biochemical support for the potential impact of such a feedback loop.Recent work by Srinivasula et al. (19Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chal J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Alnemri T.F. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Google Scholar) would predict that feedback cleavage of caspase-9 by caspase-3, and loss of the BIR3 binding motif, would be accompanied by a loss of sensitivity to inhibition by XIAP, representing a potential point of no return for the cell. Thus, we were surprised to observe that either full-length XIAP or the isolated BIR3 domain is equally effective at inhibiting p10-containing forms of caspase-9 (p35/p10, p37/p10) as the p12-containing caspase-9 (p35/p12, Table II and Fig. 5). Cleavage by caspase-3 at Asp330 exposes a tetrapeptide motif AISS that appears to be responsible for XIAP inhibition (Fig. 5). Two lines of evidence support this conclusion: 1) the similarity of the AISS sequence to the SMAC/reaper tetrapeptide motif (Fig. 5 B), and 2) the nearly complete loss of function when the NH2-terminal alanine of p10 is mutated to glycine (Fig. 5,A, E, and F). This p10 NH2terminus is well conserved (Fig. 5 B), indicating that it is important that caspase-3 feedback-cleaved caspase-9 still be subject to regulation by IAPs.The catalytic activity of caspase-9 in the apoptosome is regulated at multiple levels. First, noncovalent association with Apaf-1 via CARD/CARD interaction causes an increase in protease activity (18Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Google Scholar, 28Renatus M. Stennicke H.R. Scott F.L. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14250-14255Google Scholar). The precise activation mechanism is unknown but may involve allosteric changes in procaspase-9 induced upon binding to Apaf-1. Second, autolytic cleavage at Asp315, perhaps because of the induced proximity (14Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Google Scholar) of caspase-9 molecules in the multivalent apoptosome, further increases caspase-9 protease activity. Third, feedback cleavage at Asp330 by caspase-3 increases caspase-9 activity still further, providing for an amplification of the cascade. How the loss of the 15-amino acid linker region leads to enhancement of the catalytic activity is not clear. In the recently published structure of caspase-9 the NH2 terminus of the p12 subunit was not resolved (28Renatus M. Stennicke H.R. Scott F.L. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14250-14255Google Scholar). However, the NH2terminus of the p12 subunit was adjacent to the catalytic site, suggesting that removal of the NH2 terminus could affect either substrate recognition or catalysis by caspase-9. Finally, all forms of activated caspase-9 are subject to inhibition by XIAP. Thus, even after full activation of the apoptosome, it appears that XIAP may be capable of setting a threshold over which sufficient active caspase-9 must be generated before a cell can complete the apoptotic program. Caspases are a unique class of cysteine proteases that function as effectors of apoptosis, or programmed cell death (1Thornberry N.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1023-1027Google Scholar, 2Cryns V.

Two mechanisms have been described for activating caspases: noncovalent association with caspase activating proteins (e.g. Fadd, Apaf-1) leading to autocatalytic cleavage of the procaspase polypeptide at specific aspartic acid residues, or cleavage at specific aspartic acid residues within the zymogen by other activated caspases. Caspases have been divided into initiators (caspases-2, -8, -9, and -10) and effectors (caspases-3, -6, and -7) based on their relative position within a caspase cascade (3Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

Initiator caspases are activated by the former mechanism, effector caspases by the latter. The combined proteolytic activities of initiator and effector caspases cleave a variety of vital protein substrates, including DFF45/ICAD, lamin B, gelsolin, Bid, and PAK2, leading to the morphological and biochemical characteristics of apoptosis (8Kothakota S.

Caspase-9 is the initiator caspase in the “intrinsic” or mitochrondrial caspase pathway. Interaction of caspase-9 with Apaf-1, a human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans CED4 protein, to form the apoptosome occurs in response to cytochrome crelease from the mitochondria of pre-apoptotic cells (12Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Google Scholar). The apoptosome is a multiprotein complex comprised of Apaf-1, cytochromec, and caspase-9 in a 1:1:1 molar ratio (12Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Google Scholar, 13Purring C. Zou H. Wang X. McLendon G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7435-7436Google Scholar). The function of the apoptosome is to cleave and activate the apoptosis effector caspases-3, -6, and -7 (14Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Google Scholar, 29Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Google Scholar). The apoptosome is assembled when seven Apaf-1:cytochrome c heterodimers oligomerize to form a symmetrical “wheel” and procaspase-9 molecules become associated noncovalently to Apaf-1 via caspase-9 CARD/Apaf-1 CARD heterophilic interaction (15Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shim Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-559Google Scholar, 16Acehan D. Jiang X. Morgan D.G. Heuser J.E. Wang X. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 423-432Google Scholar). Binding of procaspase-9 to Apaf-1 is important for two reasons. First, it increases the intrinsic catalytic activity of the caspase-9 protease leading to the autolytic cleavage of procaspase-9 at Asp315 to yield a large (p35) and a small (p12) subunit (14Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Google Scholar, 17Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Google Scholar, 18Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Google Scholar). And second, cleavage exposes a neo-epitope comprising the NH2–terminal four amino acids (ATPF) of the small p12 subunit that has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for binding to the BIR3 domain of XIAP, leading to inhibition of caspase-9 (19Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chal J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Alnemri T.F. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Google Scholar). Once activated in the apoptosome, caspase-9 cleaves procaspase-3 at Asp175 and activates caspase-3. Studies in vitro (14Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Google Scholar, 29Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Google Scholar) and in intact cells (20Fujita E. Egashira J. Urase K. Kuida K. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 335-344Google Scholar) have shown that caspase-3 is capable of feedback cleavage of caspase-9 at Asp330, and that this cleavage is associated with an increase in apoptosome activity. Caspase-3-directed feedback cleavage of caspase-9 p35/p12 at Asp330 would remove the BIR3 recognition motif of caspase-9 (19Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chal J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Alnemri T.F. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Google Scholar), creating a caspase-9 species, p35/p10, which may be insensitive to XIAP inhibition. Using purified, recombinant Apaf-1, caspase-9, and caspase-3 the present study has addressed the regulation of the apoptosome at three levels. 1) Does caspase-9 cleavage affect apoptosome activity? 2) What is the impact of caspase-3-mediated feedback cleavage of caspase-9 on apoptosome activity? And 3) following feedback cleavage of caspase-9, what impact does the loss of the BIR3 binding motif from the linker region have on XIAP inhibition. Our results show that recombinant proteins can combine in a dATP- and cytochrome c-dependent manner to yield a catalytically active apoptosome capable of cleaving and activating recombinant procaspase-3. The data further demonstrate that association of procaspase-9 with Apaf-1 leads to a partial active apoptosome containing p35/p12 caspase-9. Activation of caspase-3 by the p35/p12-containing apoptosomes leads to the initiation of a feedback loop whereby caspase-3 cleaves caspase-9 at Asp330. Our data further demonstrate that p10-containing apoptosomes have enhanced catalytic properties relative to p12-containing species. Finally, our study identifies a novel motif at the NH2 terminus of the p10 subunit capable of mediating XIAP inhibition. Thus, whereas feedback cleavage of caspase-9 by caspase-3 significantly increases the proteolytic activity of the apoptosome, it does little to attenuate its sensitivity to inhibition by the endogenous caspase-9 inhibitor, XIAP. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have addressed the potential physiological role(s) of caspase-3-mediated feedback cleavage of caspase-9 using purified, recombinant Apaf-1, caspase-9, and caspase-3 proteins in a reconstituted apoptosome in vitro. Because caspase-9 can be cleaved by itself (Asp315) or by caspase-3 (Asp330), the combined action of the two proteases on procaspase-9 can produce three different caspase-9 enzymes: p35/p12, p37/p10, or p35/p10 (Fig. 1). We attempted to discriminate the role of each cleavage site by generating various recombinant caspase-9 species. First we generated procaspase-9 species in which each cleavage site had been eliminated alone or in combination and assessed their ability to activate procaspase-3. Second we produced all three processed forms of caspase-9, p35/p12, p37/p10, and p35/p10, and reconstituted them separately into the apoptosome to compare their relative catalytic activities and sensitivities to inhibition by the BIR3 domain of XIAP.Experiments in which procaspase-9 with cleavage mutations were used suggest that cleavage at Asp330 is required for full activation of the apoptosome (Fig. 2 C). This observation is inconsistent with previously published reports (17Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Google Scholar, 18Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Google Scholar, 19Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chal J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Alnemri T.F. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Google Scholar) in which little, if any, difference was observed in the ability of unprocessed and processed caspase-9 to cleave and activate procaspase-3. Although no definitive explanation for this discrepancy can be presented, there were significant differences in methodology between these previous reports and the present work. In general, the previous reports employed cellular extracts as the context for assessing relative activities of caspase-9, whereas the present work utilized recombinant proteins at defined concentrations and molar ratios. The use of cellular extracts may introduce additional cytosolic factors, including but not limited to endogenous procaspase-9 that may modulate apoptosome activity and obscure the potential impact of cleavage at Asp330.Cleavage of caspase-9 at Asp330 by caspase-3 increases the catalytic activity of caspase-9 in the apoptosome up to 8-fold. This is because of an increase in k cat and a decrease inK m of p10-containing forms of the apoptosome as measured by cleavage of the caspase-9 substrate LEHD-AMC (Table I). Thus, caspase-3 feedback cleavage of either p35/p12 (to generate p35/p10) or uncleaved procaspase-9 (to generate p37/p10) has the potential to amplify the proteolytic activity of the apoptosome. If operational in cells, this would create a feed-forward mechanism to accelerate the apoptotic destruction of the cell once the downstream effector caspase-3 has been activated. At least two recent studies support this possibility. Fujita et al. (20Fujita E. Egashira J. Urase K. Kuida K. Momoi T. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 335-344Google Scholar), using caspase-9 cleavage site-specific antibodies, demonstrated in living mouse cells a sequential cleavage of procaspase-9, first by caspase-9 and then by caspase-3. These authors also noted a correlation between cleavage at Asp330 and increased cellular caspase-9 activity. In a second study, Slee et al. (29Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Google Scholar) using cell-free extracts, have demonstrated a requirement for caspase-3 activity to achieve maximum apoptosome activity. The optimum activity in this study also correlated with the presence of an Asp330 cleavage product. Our data are consistent with these observations and provide biochemical support for the potential impact of such a feedback loop.Recent work by Srinivasula et al. (19Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chal J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Alnemri T.F. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Google Scholar) would predict that feedback cleavage of caspase-9 by caspase-3, and loss of the BIR3 binding motif, would be accompanied by a loss of sensitivity to inhibition by XIAP, representing a potential point of no return for the cell. Thus, we were surprised to observe that either full-length XIAP or the isolated BIR3 domain is equally effective at inhibiting p10-containing forms of caspase-9 (p35/p10, p37/p10) as the p12-containing caspase-9 (p35/p12, Table II and Fig. 5). Cleavage by caspase-3 at Asp330 exposes a tetrapeptide motif AISS that appears to be responsible for XIAP inhibition (Fig. 5). Two lines of evidence support this conclusion: 1) the similarity of the AISS sequence to the SMAC/reaper tetrapeptide motif (Fig. 5 B), and 2) the nearly complete loss of function when the NH2-terminal alanine of p10 is mutated to glycine (Fig. 5,A, E, and F). This p10 NH2terminus is well conserved (Fig. 5 B), indicating that it is important that caspase-3 feedback-cleaved caspase-9 still be subject to regulation by IAPs.The catalytic activity of caspase-9 in the apoptosome is regulated at multiple levels. First, noncovalent association with Apaf-1 via CARD/CARD interaction causes an increase in protease activity (18Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Google Scholar, 28Renatus M. Stennicke H.R. Scott F.L. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14250-14255Google Scholar). The precise activation mechanism is unknown but may involve allosteric changes in procaspase-9 induced upon binding to Apaf-1. Second, autolytic cleavage at Asp315, perhaps because of the induced proximity (14Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Google Scholar) of caspase-9 molecules in the multivalent apoptosome, further increases caspase-9 protease activity. Third, feedback cleavage at Asp330 by caspase-3 increases caspase-9 activity still further, providing for an amplification of the cascade. How the loss of the 15-amino acid linker region leads to enhancement of the catalytic activity is not clear. In the recently published structure of caspase-9 the NH2 terminus of the p12 subunit was not resolved (28Renatus M. Stennicke H.R. Scott F.L. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14250-14255Google Scholar). However, the NH2terminus of the p12 subunit was adjacent to the catalytic site, suggesting that removal of the NH2 terminus could affect either substrate recognition or catalysis by caspase-9. Finally, all forms of activated caspase-9 are subject to inhibition by XIAP. Thus, even after full activation of the apoptosome, it appears that XIAP may be capable of setting a threshold over which sufficient active caspase-9 must be generated before a cell can complete the apoptotic program. In the present study, we have addressed the potential physiological role(s) of caspase-3-mediated feedback cleavage of caspase-9 using purified, recombinant Apaf-1, caspase-9, and caspase-3 proteins in a reconstituted apoptosome in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W1982159610,"A rapid cascade of regulatory events defines the developmental fates of embryonic cells. However, once established, these developmental fates and the underlying transcriptional programs can be remarkably stable. Here, we describe two proteins, MEP-1 and LET-418/Mi-2, required for maintenance of somatic differentiation in C. elegans. In animals lacking MEP-1 and LET-418, germline-specific genes become derepressed in somatic cells, and Polycomb group (PcG) and SET domain-related proteins promote this ectopic expression. MEP-1 and LET-418 interact in vivo with the germline-protein PIE-1. Our findings support a model in which PIE-1 inhibits MEP-1 and associated factors to maintain the pluripotency of germ cells, while at later times MEP-1 and LET-418 remodel chromatin to establish new stage- or cell-type-specific differentiation potential."

Scully R. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10626-10631Google Scholar) of the promoter region whereas NR/co-repressor complexes recruit histone deacetylases. Although various protein-protein interactions and enzymatic activities seem to play important roles in mediating transcriptional activity by NRs, it is possible that other mechanisms, such as the subcellular distribution and intranuclear dynamics of NRs, may contribute to hormonal responses mediated by these receptors.Recently, several groups have shown that progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors (PRs and GRs), VDRs, and TRs continuously shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus (5Guiochon-Mantel A.

Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Google Scholar). We previously used green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of TRॆ to show that entry into the nucleus is an energy-mediated process whereas export out of the nucleus is a passive one (9Baumann C.T. Maruvada P. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11237-11245Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results showed that ablation of the DNA-binding capacity of TR did not prevent its nuclear accumulation. Using TR mutants that were defective in their interaction with various co-regulators, we showed that heterodimerization with RXR and interaction with NCoR help maintain unliganded TR within the nucleus.We and others (10Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Google Scholar, 11Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 366-375Google Scholar) have shown that GFP chimeras of ER, GR, and TR form a punctate pattern in the nucleus after ligand addition, suggesting that intranuclear diffusion and reorganization of NRs may be important regulatory processes. Recently, Mancini and co-workers (13Stenoien D.L. Patel K. Mancini M.G. Dutertre M. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Mancini M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 15-23Google Scholar) have shown that unliganded ER exhibits high mobility whereas estrogen-bound ER has reduced mobility in the nucleus. Additionally, we have shown that GR rapidly exchanges with regulatory DNA sequences and is not statically bound to hormone response elements as thought previously (14McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Google Scholar). In this paper, we have used GFP chimeras of ER, RAR, and TR as examples of Type I and II receptors to examine and compare nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and intranuclear diffusion of NRs in more detail. In particular, we have used energy depletion studies, heterokaryon experiments, and fluorescence after photo-bleaching to examine the movement of these receptors in the absence or presence of ligand and co-regulators. Our studies suggest that ligand-binding and protein-protein interactions can significantly influence the mobility of these NRs and thereby contribute to their biological activity.RESULTSTo study the intracellular distribution of NRs in living cells, we created vectors expressing GFP chimeras fused to the N-terminal ends of TRॆ, ERα, and RARॆ (Fig.1A). Western blot analysis of extracts obtained from transfected cells showed that all the fusion constructs encoded full-length proteins of correct size (data not shown). The transcriptional activities of the GFP-NRs were assayed in a transient transfection system, and the levels of ligand-dependent transactivation were similar to unfused receptors (Fig. 1B) (data not shown).We examined the intracellular distribution of GFP-ER and GFP-RAR in live cells and found that these receptors localized mostly in the nucleus, similar to previous observations for TRॆ and ERα (9Baumann C.T. Maruvada P. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11237-11245Google Scholar, 18Zhu X.G. Hanover J.A. Hager G.L. Cheng S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27058-27063Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2A and Fig.3A). To quantitate the percentage of NRs present within the nucleus and cytoplasm, we measured the area-corrected intensity of GFP-NR fluorescence in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. From these analyses, we observed that only about 10–157 of unliganded GFP-ER (Fig. 2A) was present in the cytoplasm, and ER effectively translocated into the nucleus after estradiol (E2; 10−6m) or tamoxifen (Txn; 10−8m) treatment for 1 h (Fig. 2, B andC). Similar to GFP-ER, ∼207 of unliganded GFP-RAR (Fig.3B) was present in the cytoplasm, and GFP-RAR almost entirely translocated into the nucleus after retinoic acid (RA; 10−6m) treatment (Fig. 3B). These changes in the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of ER and RAR after ligand addition contrast with our previous observations for TRॆ, which maintained ∼107 of receptor in the cytoplasm regardless of whether ligand was present (9Baumann C.T. Maruvada P. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11237-11245Google Scholar). The observed nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution was independent of the amount of expression vector transfected, as it remained constant when varying concentrations of GFP-ER and GFP-RAR vectors were transfected into HeLa cells (data not shown). In these experiments, we also observed that ligand induced intranuclear reorganization of GFP-ER and GFP-RAR (see Fig. 2, A–C and Fig. 3, A andB) similar to previous observations for GR, ER, and, TR (9Baumann C.T. Maruvada P. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11237-11245Google Scholar, 10Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol.

In the absence of ligand, GFP-ER and GFP-RAR displayed a diffuse, reticular pattern whereas in the presence of their cognate ligands, these receptors exhibited a discrete, punctate pattern. These effects were rapid with equilibrium patterns occurring within 10 min after ligand addition (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of ligands on the intranuclear distribution and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of GFP-ER.HeLa cells were transfected with 0.1 ॖg of pEGFP-ER and subsequently depleted of intracellular ATP levels by treating with sodium azide (10 mm) in the presence of deoxyglucose (6 mm) and imaged after 2 h.

We showed previously (9Baumann C.T. Maruvada P. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11237-11245Google Scholar) that nuclear import of GFP-TRॆ is an energy-mediated process and that its export is a passive one. We now observed similar findings for both GFP-ER and GFP-RAR. After a 2-h treatment with sodium azide, more than 207 of GFP-ER redistributed to the cytoplasm indicating that a subpopulation of GFP-ER shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, treatment with either E2 or tamoxifen prior to sodium azide treatment prevented cytoplasmic accumulation (Fig. 2, E and F) indicating that ligand binding to GFP-ER decreases shuttling out of the nucleus. Similarly, a significant amount of GFP-RAR was found to undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Fig. 3D). This shuttling out of the nucleus was prevented by either ligand treatment or co-expression of unfused RXR (Fig. 3, E and F) and suggests that ligand binding and heterodimerization help retain GFP-RAR in the nucleus.We then used the heterokaryon system to further study the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling by GFP-ER. In these studies, NIH3T3 cells expressing GFP-ER were fused with nonexpressing HeLa cells, in both the presence and absence of ligands. We observed that GFP-ER translocated from the NIH3T3 nucleus to the HeLa nucleus, indicating that GFP-ER rapidly shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig.4, A and B). However, in the presence of either E2 or tamoxifen, translocation of GFP-ER into the HeLa nucleus was reduced (Fig. 4,C–F) indicating decreased nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.Figure 4Heterokaryon experiments to study GFP-ER nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. GFP-ER-expressing NIH3T3 cells were fused with HeLa cells using polyethylene glycol1500 for 2 min as described under 舠Materials and Methods.舡 The cells were treated with E2 (10−6m) or tamoxifen (10−8m). The identity of each nucleus was determined by DAPI staining of the nuclei (right panel).

GFP-ER was retained in the HeLa cell nuclei in the absence of ligand, E2, and tamoxifen suggesting that ER export occurs by CRM-1 regardless of its ligand-binding state. Similar results also were observed for GFP-TRॆ and GFP-RAR (data not shown).Figure 5Effect of leptomycin B on GFP-ER shuttling in the heterokaryon system. GFP-ER-expressing NIH3T3 cells were fused with HeLa cells. Cells were treated with 10−9m leptomycin B for 3 h in either the absence or presence of E2 (10−6m) or Txn (10−8m). Shown is GFP-ER distribution between heterokaryons treated with no ligand (A), in the presence of E2 (B), or Txn (C). DNA counter-staining with DAPI of these treatments is shown in panels D, E, and F. GFP-ER distribution between heterokaryons in the presence of leptomyin B was as follows: GFP-ER treated with no ligand (G), E2 (H), or Txn (I). DNA counter-staining with DAPI of these treatments is shown in panels J–L.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These foregoing findings suggest that GFP-ER and GFP-RAR shuttle between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Additionally, our findings in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that these receptors reorganize within the nucleus upon ligand binding. To better understand this latter phenomenon, we used FRAP to study the intranuclear mobility of GFP-ER, GFP-RAR, and GFP-TR in transfected cells in the presence and absence of ligand. In these studies, a full power laser beam was focused for 0.5 s on the nuclei of GFP-NR-expressing cells, causing fluorescence loss in a defined nuclear zone. The mobility of GFP-NR molecules was then measured as a function of fluorescence recovery over time in the bleached region.Under these conditions, we determined the recovery rate of a mobile fraction of GFP-NRs in which fluorescence recovery could be measured (t12 ) and observed an immobile fraction in which no recovery occurred even after 3 min (original fluorescence (1007) − 7 of recovery after 3 min). The calculated data of ten individual cells from six different experiments are shown in TableI. The effect of ligands on the mobility of GFP-ER was studied using the FRAP technique (see Fig.6 and Fig. 7A). In cells transfected with GFP-ER vector, bleaching for 0.5 s caused only a 557 reduction in fluorescence within the nuclear zone, indicating that unliganded GFP-ER was extremely mobile and rapidly moved back to the bleached zone, even during the time between the bleaching process and first measurement (see Fig. 6A and Fig. 7A). Rapid recovery was observed (t12 = 1.6 s) as more than 907 of fluorescence recovery occurred within 3 s, and maximal recovery occurred in less than 12 s. The immobile fraction was 147. To observe the effect of ligands on the mobility of GFP-ER, we incubated transfected cells with either E2 or tamoxifen for 1 h and then subjected the cells to FRAP (see Fig. 6, B andC and Fig. 7A). In these studies, we found that cells treated with E2 had more than 707 loss in fluorescence initially, and t12 = 5.8 s, with an immobile fraction of 447 (see Fig. 7A and Table I). These findings demonstrated that E2 reduced the rate at which GFP-ER returns to the bleached zone and increased the amount of ER that was unable to diffuse readily. Interestingly, treatment with the ER antagonist, tamoxifen, resulted in almost total loss in fluorescence, with little fluorescence recovery even after 3 min because of a large immobile fraction (see Fig. 6C, Fig.7A, and Table I) (data not shown). In all these experiments, the recovered fluorescence was normalized to unbleached control cells in the same experiments. All the experiments were repeated more than six times with similar findings.Table It12 of NR fluorescence recovery and 7 immobile fractiont12 in s7 immobile fractionER1.6 ± 0.314ER + E25.8 ± 0.444ER + SRC3.6 ± 0.514ER + SRC + E26.9 ± 0.742ER + Txn8.3 ± 0.468RAR1.9 ± 0.218RAR + RA2.3 ± 0.418TR1.8 ± 0.312TR + T31.8 ± 0.214n = 10 for each condition.

Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar). To study the effect of SRC-1 on the intranuclear mobility of GFP-ER, we performed FRAP on cells co-expressing both GFP-ER and unfused SRC-1, in both the absence and presence of E2 (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, there was delayed recovery of fluorescence of unliganded GFP-ER in the presence of SRC-1 (t12 = 3.6 sversus 1.6 s, respectively) with a maximal recovery occurring by ∼20 s (Fig. 7B). These findings suggest a possible association between SRC-1 and unliganded GFP-ER that may decrease the mobility of the latter. In the presence of E2, more than 807 of fluorescence was bleached in cells transfected with GFP-ER and SRC-1, compared with 707 bleaching in cells transfected with only GFP-ER. Additionally, recovery time was slower in cells transfected with GFP-ER and SRC-1 than GFP-ER alone (t12 = 6.9 s versus 5.8 s, respectively). These findings suggest that SRC-1 may reduce the intranuclear mobility of E2-bound ER.To further investigate the effect of ligands on the mobility of nuclear hormone receptors, we performed FRAP on cells expressing GFP-RAR in the presence and absence of RA (Fig.8A). GFP-RAR was highly mobile in the absence of ligand as there was only a 407 loss in fluorescence after photo-bleaching, and maximal recovery occurred by 10 s (Fig.8A). In the presence of RA, there was little change in the intranuclear mobility of GFP-RAR (t12 = 2.3 sversus 2.0 s). FRAP studies on unliganded GFP-TRॆ showed very similar recovery kinetics as GFP-RAR as there was only a 407 loss in fluorescence after photo-bleaching and almost total fluorescence recovery after 10 s (Fig. 8B). In the presence of T3, there was little change in mobility of GFP-TR as maximal fluorescence recovery occurred by 5 s, andt12 remained unchanged (1.8 s). In contrast to the effect of SRC-1 on ER mobility, co-transfection of SRC-1, as well as NCoR and HDAC-1, did not affect the intranuclear mobility of GFP-TR (data not shown). We observed previously that nuclear export of ER, RAR, and TR was mediated by CRM-1; thus, we examined whether CRM-1 may be associated with GFP-ER and modulate its intranuclear mobility (Fig.9). However, we did not observe co-localization of CRM-1 and GFP-ER in the absence or presence of ligand, suggesting that exportin does not modulate intranuclear mobility of ER.Figure 8Time course of FRAP of nuclear GFP-RAR and GFP-TR in the presence of their respective ligands.

In the absence of ligand, all the NRs studied displayed predominantly nuclear distribution. In contrast, previous studies of some steroid hormone receptors, particularly GR and PR, showed mostly cytoplasmic distribution in the absence of ligand (12Lim C.S. Baumann C.T. Htun H. Xian W. Irie M. Smith C.L. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 366-375Google Scholar, 19Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4845-4850Google Scholar). This distribution is likely maintained by the formation of cytoplasmic complexes that include chaperone proteins such as hsp 70 and hsp 90 (20Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocrinol. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Google Scholar). The location of unliganded ER is still controversial as earlier biochemical studies suggested ER was mostly cytoplasmic, but later cell fractionation and immunohistochemical studies suggested it was predominantly nuclear (21King W.J. Greene G.L. Nature. 1984; 307: 745-747Google Scholar, 22Raam S. Lauretano A.M. Vrabel D.M. Pappas C.A. Tamura H. Steroids. 1988; 51: 425-439Google Scholar, 23Welshons W.V. Lieberman M.E. Gorski J. Nature. 1984; 307: 747-749Google Scholar, 24Dauvois S. White R. Parker M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1377-1388Google Scholar). Recent studies with GFP-ER have not addressed directly the issue of unliganded ER localization (10Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Google Scholar, 11Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534Google Scholar). Here, we show that a small pool of unliganded ER exists in the cytoplasm, and it constantly shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in live cells. Moreover, the cellular distribution and shuttling of ER is markedly affected by estrogen treatment. Interestingly, the estrogen antagonist, tamoxifen, also has similar effects as estrogen on receptor cycling and retention, suggesting it does not interfere with these particular receptor roles. We also showed that the nuclear import of ER is an energy-dependent process similar to our present findings for RAR and previous studies for TR and PR (5Guiochon-Mantel A. Lescop P. Christin-Maitre S. Loosfelt H. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3851-3859Google Scholar, 9Baumann C.T. Maruvada P. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11237-11245Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that nuclear export of ER, RAR, and TR is mediated via the exportin, CRM-1 (25Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that VDR, but not PR and GR, were blocked by leptomycin B (26Prufer K. Barsony J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1738-1751Google Scholar, 27Tyagi R.K. Amazit L. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Guiochon-Mantel A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1684-1695Google Scholar, 28Liu J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 40-51Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible there may be more than one mechanism for nuclear export of nuclear hormone receptors.The mechanism for the nuclear retention of ER is not known; however, it is possible that ligand binding may facilitate interactions with nuclear proteins or components. For instance, it is known that liganded ERs can form multimeric transcription complexes containing co-activators (1McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar). Recent studies also have shown that E2-bound ER and T3-bound TR can bind to the nuclear matrix component (9Baumann C.T. Maruvada P. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11237-11245Google Scholar, 11S"
https://openalex.org/W1987209219,"GroEL/S chaperonin ring complexes fold many unrelated proteins. To understand the basis and extent of the chaperonin substrate spectrum, we used rounds of selection and DNA shuffling to obtain GroEL/S variants that dramatically enhanced folding of a single substrate-green fluorescent protein (GFP). Changes in the substrate-optimized chaperonins increase the polarity of the folding cavity and alter the ATPase cycle. These findings reveal a surprising plasticity of GroEL/S, which can be exploited to aid folding of recombinant proteins. Our studies also reveal a conflict between specialization and generalization of chaperonins as increased GFP folding comes at the expense of the ability of GroEL/S to fold its natural substrates. This conflict and the nature of the ring structure may help explain the evolution of cellular chaperone systems."
https://openalex.org/W2044180329,"DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are formed upon exposure to a variety of chemical and physical agents and pose a threat to genomic integrity. In particular, acrolein and related aldehydes produce DPCs, although the chemical linkages for such cross-links have not been identified. Here, we report that oligodeoxynucleotides containing 1,N 2-deoxyguanosine adducts of acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and trans-4-hydroxynonenal can form cross-links with the tetrapeptide Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys. We concluded that complex formation is mediated by a Schiff base linkage because DNA-peptide complexes were covalently trapped following reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride, and pre-reduction of adducted DNAs inhibited complex formation. A previous NMR study demonstrated that duplex DNA catalyzes ring opening for the acrolein-derived γ-hydroxy-1,N 2-propanodeoxyguanosine adduct to yield an aldehydic function (de los Santos, C., Zaliznyak, T., and Johnson, F. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, 9077–9082). Consistent with this earlier observation, the adducts under investigation were more reactive in duplex DNA than in single-stranded DNA, and we concluded that the ring-open aldehydic moiety is the induced tautomer in duplex DNA for adducts exhibiting high relative reactivity. Adducted DNA cross-linked to Arg-Trp-Arg-Arg and Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys with comparable efficiency, andN α-acetylation of peptides dramatically inhibited trapping; thus, the reactive nucleophile is located at the N-terminal α-amine of the peptide. These data suggest that Schiff base chemistry can mediate DPC formation in vivo following the formation of stable aldehyde-derived DNA adducts.

Adducted DNA cross-linked to Arg-Trp-Arg-Arg and Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys with comparable efficiency, andN α-acetylation of peptides dramatically inhibited trapping; thus, the reactive nucleophile is located at the N-terminal α-amine of the peptide. These data suggest that Schiff base chemistry can mediate DPC formation in vivo following the formation of stable aldehyde-derived DNA adducts.

Not surprisingly, aldehydes with established DPC-forming ability disrupt DNA replication for the SV40 minichromosome following exogenous exposure (13Permana P.A. Snapka R.M. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1031-1036Google Scholar), suggesting that DPC damage presents a major obstacle to the mammalian DNA replication (and transcription) machinery. We envisage that a DNA repair and/or damage avoidance pathway exists to prevent interruptions to these normal cellular events, although a unified repair scheme has not been elucidated for all DPC lesions. In particular, studies conducted in xeroderma pigmentosum cells have implicated nucleotide excision repair (NER) in the removal of DPCs induced by trans-Pt(II)diammine dichloride (1Fornace Jr., A.J. Seres D.S. Mutat. Res. 1982; 94: 277-284Google Scholar); however, studies on formaldehyde-induced DPCs indicate that NER is a dispensable pathway in the active repair of these lesions (14Grafstrom R.C. Fornace Jr., A. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 4323-4327Google Scholar, 15Speit G. Schutz P. Merk O. Mutagenesis. 2000; 15: 85-90Google Scholar, 16Quievryn G. Zhitkovich A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1573-1580Google Scholar).Among the agents that induce DPCs, acrolein and crotonaldehyde are bifunctional electrophiles belonging to a group of highly reactive aldehydes termed 2-alkenals. These compounds retain two electrophilic reaction centers and are capable of forming various DNA and protein adducts as well as DPCs (2Kuykendall J.R. Bogdanffy M.S. Mutat. Res. 1992; 283: 131-136Google Scholar, 17Ichihashi K. Osawa T. Toyokuni S. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23903-23913Google Scholar, 18Furuhata A. Nakamura M. Osawa T. Uchida K. J. Biol.

It has been postulated that the 2-alkenals and also the structurally related 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals (e.g. trans-4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)) represent significant sources of endogenous DNA damage because of their presence as metabolites of lipid peroxidation (19Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Google Scholar, 20Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 277-290Google Scholar). Acrolein and crotonaldehyde are known carcinogens and pose an environmental health risk as constituents of automotive exhaust and tobacco smoke (21Beauchamp Jr., R.O. Andjelkovich D.A. Kligerman A.D. Morgan K.T. Heck H.D. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1985; 14: 309-380Google Scholar, 22Nath R.G. Ocando J.E. Guttenplan J.B. Chung F.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 581-584Google Scholar); however, because these 2-alkenals cause damage to a multitude of cellular macromolecules, what role DPC formation plays in their observed mutagenic and carcinogenic effects is as yet unclear. Likewise, although the formation of 4-hydroxynonenal-derived protein adducts has been correlated with degenerative conditions such as cardiovascular and Parkinson's diseases (23Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Google Scholar, 24Yoritaka A. Hattori N. Uchida K. Tanaka M. Stadtman E.R. Mizuno Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2696-2701Google Scholar), demonstration that HNE can induce DPCs may suggest alternative mechanisms to explain the observed cytotoxicity of this compound.In the case of formaldehyde- and malondialdehyde-induced DPCs, the sequence of reactivity in cross-link formation appears to involve a rapid primary reaction to form a protein adduct, followed by a slower secondary reaction with DNA amines to form a DPC (25Ohba Y. Morimitsu Y. Watarai A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 285-293Google Scholar, 26Voitkun V. Zhitkovich A. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 97-106Google Scholar). However, the detection of stable acrolein-, crotonaldehyde-, and 4-hydroxynonenal-derived DNA adducts in vivo (27Nath R.G. Chung F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7491-7495Google Scholar, 28Nath R.G. Ocando J.E. Chung F.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 452-456Google Scholar, 29Chung F.L. Nath R.G. Ocando J. Nishikawa A. Zhang L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1507-1511Google Scholar) suggests that bifunctional electrophiles can react to form primary DNA adducts capable of participating in secondary reactions with proteins. Acrolein reacts with DNA to form a major exocyclic adduct, γ-hydroxy-1,N 2-propanodeoxyguanosine (γ-HOPdG); and recently, this adduct was shown to undergo ring opening in duplex DNA to yield an aldehydic moiety (30de los Santos C. Zaliznyak T. Johnson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9077-9082Google Scholar). Consistent with the predicted reactivity of the ring-open aldehydic tautomer, the γ-HOPdG adduct was shown to form an interstrand DNA-DNA cross-link to the N 2-position of an opposing guanine base in a 5′-CpG sequence context, mediated by a Schiff base (or carbinolamine) linkage (31Kozekov I.D. Nechev L.V. Sanchez A. Harris C.M. Lloyd R.S. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1482-1485Google Scholar). To test the possibility that peptide amines might also provide suitable substrates for cross-link formation, we evaluated the propensity for the major 1,N 2-deoxyguanosine adducts of acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and HNE (Fig.1) to form cross-links with the tetrapeptide Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys. These DNA adducts were synthesized previously for acrolein (32Nechev L.V. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 421-429Google Scholar), crotonaldehyde (33Nechev L.V. Kozekov I. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1506-1512Google Scholar), and HNE (34Wang H. Rizzo C.J. Org. Lett. 2001; 3: 3603-3605Google Scholar), and each was constructed into a 12-mer oligodeoxynucleotide for use in this study. We utilized a borohydride trapping methodology to covalently trap Schiff base-mediated DNA-peptide complexes at the ring-open aldehydic adducts, similar to methodology used recently in probing the catalytic mechanism of peptide-catalyzed β-elimination at abasic sites (35Kurtz A.J. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7054-7064Google Scholar). Additionally, the reactivity of each adduct was assessed in single-stranded and duplex DNAs, and a characteristic amine capable of forming such a cross-link was identified.DISCUSSIONIt has been well documented that aldehydes react with biomolecules to form a variety of adducts, many of which have been correlated with mutagenic, carcinogenic, and cytotoxic consequences. In particular, acrolein and crotonaldehyde were shown previously to form protein adducts at lysine residues by Schiff base and Michael addition pathways (17Ichihashi K. Osawa T. Toyokuni S. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23903-23913Google Scholar, 18Furuhata A. Nakamura M. Osawa T. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27919-27926Google Scholar); however, although these compounds can also produce DPCs, the chemistry underlying the formation of these adducts has not been elucidated. We are unaware of any prior study demonstrating that HNE can produce DPCs, although Uchida and Stadtman (40Uchida K. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6388-6393Google Scholar) proposed that HNE-derived Michael addition products may participate in secondary reactions to form lysine-mediated inter- and intrasubunit protein cross-links. This observation suggests that an analogous reaction of HNE with a protein lysine and a nucleic acid amine might represent a plausible pathway in the formation of DPCs. In addition, the detection of 1,N 2-deoxyguanosine adducts of acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal in human and rodent tissues, both as endogenous adducts and following chemical treatment (27Nath R.G. Chung F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7491-7495Google Scholar, 28Nath R.G. Ocando J.E. Chung F.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 452-456Google Scholar, 29Chung F.L. Nath R.G. Ocando J.

Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1291-1297Google Scholar, 43Chung F.L. Nath R.G. Nagao M. Nishikawa A. Zhou G.D. Randerath K. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 71-81Google Scholar), may indicate that these stable DNA adducts exist as intermediates along a pathway of formation for DPCs. Consistent with such a mechanism, the results presented here demonstrate that peptide amines can react with these DNA adducts to form DNA-peptide cross-links via Schiff base linkage. We propose that this pathway may account for a subset of DPCs formed within the cell whereby nucleophilic functions on proteins react with primary aldehyde-derived DNA adducts. For example, the case in which a lysine-rich histone protein is juxtaposed with a 1,N 2-deoxyguanosine adduct, as might be found in the nucleosome, may provide the proper scenario for such a reaction. As an alternative to this mechanism, Voitkun and Zhitkovich (26Voitkun V. Zhitkovich A. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 97-106Google Scholar) demonstrated previously that malondialdehyde (a bifunctional electrophile and known DPC inducer) reacts preferentially with the histone H1 protein compared with DNA in vitro, leading to an adducted protein intermediate that precedes the formation of a DPC. However, a number of investigations have established that the malondialdehyde-derived 3-(2′-deoxy-β-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-pyrimido[1,2-a]purin-10(3H)-one (M1G) DNA adduct is a prominent endogenous lesion (44Fang J.L. Vaca C.E. Valsta L.M. Mutanen M. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1035-1040Google Scholar, 45Rouzer C.A. Chaudhary A.K. Nokubo M. Ferguson D.M. Reddy G.R. Blair I.A. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res.

Toxicol. 1997; 10: 172-180Google Scholar), indicating that malondialdehyde reacts to form a significant number of DNA adducts in vivo. It is likely that the complexity of reactions for aldehydes with biomolecules within the cell is not accurately mimicked by an in vitro examination, particularly with respect to a multistep reaction leading to the formation of a DPC. Rather, the spectrum of products observed in vitro provides insight into the possible reaction pathways for DPC formation, which may be kinetically favored or disfavored within the cell, depending on a variety of factors. These combined observations indicate a multiplicity of pathways that lead to the formation of DPCsin vivo, one of which may include the formation of stable aldehyde-derived DNA adducts as reaction intermediates.The borohydride trapping methodology employed in this study was utilized previously to isolate Schiff base intermediates in peptide-catalyzed β-elimination at abasic sites (35Kurtz A.J. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7054-7064Google Scholar). In particular, detection of DNA-peptide complexes by denaturing PAGE necessitated the stabilization of the cross-links by reduction, and the continuous presence of NaCNBH3 in our reactions irreversibly shifted the equilibrium toward the accumulation of a reduced Schiff base (Fig.2 B, species 4). As a result, we could not evaluate the stability of a nonreduced Schiff base complex from the experiments presented here. However, because we observed a small detectable level of DNA-peptide complex when reacting Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys with γ-HOPdG in the absence of reducing agent (Fig. 2), we speculate that the lifetime of a nonreduced Schiff base-mediated DPC is likely sufficient to interfere with replication or transcription in vivo.A major factor affecting the formation and stability of a Schiff base complex should be the pK a of the reactive amine because nucleophilic attack at the ring-open aldehyde adducts requires a neutral deprotonated amine. Here, we found that the preferred reactive nucleophile for peptides is located at the α-amine on the peptide (Fig. 7), consistent with the lower intrinsic pK a of an α-amine (pK a = 7.6) compared with an ε-amine (pK a = 10.3) in a random-coil peptide (47Jencks W.P. Regenstein J. Fasman G.D. 3rd Ed. CRC Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1976: 321Google Scholar). Alternatively, high local concentrations of positively charged surface residues on a protein may facilitate reaction of an ε-amine on a neighboring lysine because such an environment will serve to depress the pK a of the amine. In a previous study, lysine residues were implicated in the formation of acetaldehyde-induced DPCs (48Kuykendall J.R. Bogdanffy M.S. Mutat. Res. 1994; 311: 49-56Google Scholar); and based on the above reasoning, we suggest that lysines may also react to form Schiff base-mediated cross-links at the 1,N 2-deoxyguanosine adducts under investigation here. Importantly, such a linkage may represent one of several possibilities for DPC formation at these adducts because acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and HNE may also react at histidine and cysteine residues on proteins (19Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Google Scholar, 23Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Google Scholar, 49Butterfield D.A. Castegna A. Lauderback C.M. Drake J. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 655-664Google Scholar).As depicted in Fig. 2 B (species 1), a requisite step in the reaction of peptides to form DNA-peptide cross-links with the DNA adducts under study here is the ring opening of the adduct to form a reactive aldehyde. Recently, an NMR study confirmed that duplex DNA catalyzes rearrangement of the ring-closed γ-HOPdG adduct to the ring-open tautomer (30de los Santos C. Zaliznyak T. Johnson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9077-9082Google Scholar), and a similar result has also been observed for the structurally related malondialdehyde-derived M1G adduct (50Mao H. Schnetz-Boutaud N.C. Weisenseel J.P. Marnett L.J. Stone M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6615-6620Google Scholar). Consistent with these earlier observations, the γ-HOPdG adduct exhibited faster reaction kinetics to form DNA-peptide cross-links in duplex DNAversus single-stranded DNA in our analyses (Fig. 6). Structural studies have not yet been conducted for the crotonaldehyde and HNE adducts, although each of the adducts tested gave a result similar to that obtained with the γ-HOPdG adduct in such an experiment. Thus, we concluded that the formation of duplex DNA most probably catalyzes ring opening for the (6R,8R)- and (6S,8S)-crotonaldehyde adducts and the (6S,8R,11S)-HNE adduct in a fashion analogous to the γ-HOPdG adduct. For duplex oligonucleotides containing the (6R,8S,11R)-, (6R,8S,11S)-, and (6S,8R,11R)-HNE adducts, the observation that these substrates do not readily form cross-links may indicate that these adducts behave in a chemically distinct fashion from the (6S,8R,11S)-HNE adduct. It is as yet unclear how differences in stereochemistry might affect the ring-open/ring-closed conformational equilibria for these non-reactive diastereomers. One possibility might be that such adducts exist as ring-closed tautomers in the syn-conformation about the glycosidic bond, as shown previously for the 1,N 2-propanodeoxyguanosine adduct (51Weisenseel J.P. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Stone M.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 127-139Google Scholar). Interestingly, the potential for the γ-HOPdG adduct to assume a ring-open structure (capable of forming a canonical Watson-Crick base pair) has recently led to the proposal that the hydroxylated γ-HOPdG adduct should exhibit lower mutagenicity compared with the unhydroxylated 1,N 2-propanodeoxyguanosine adduct. In support of this model, in vitro experiments demonstrated that human polymerase η preferentially incorporates a cytosine base opposite a γ-HOPdG lesion in which the adduct is trapped as a ring-open structure by reduction, whereas the nonreduced adduct gives rise to incorporation of adenine and guanine in addition to cytosine (52Minko I.G. Washington M.T. Kanuri M. Prakash L. Prakash S. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 784-790Google Scholar). Because the experiments presented here are able to discriminate between an apparent ring-open versusring-closed structure (dependent upon the use of duplex or single-stranded DNA as a starting substrate), we suggest that peptide trapping methodology may provide a means to probe the ring structure at a primer-template junction.Although a significant amount of literature has enumerated the various agents inducing DPC damage, the potential for repair has not been clearly elucidated for these DNA lesions. When the 16-kDa DNA repair enzyme T4 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase is covalently attached to DNA as an artificial DPC lesion, the bacterial UvrABC NER proteins are able to recognize this damage and to initiate repair in vitro at a rate comparable to that observed for other well characterized NER substrates (53Minko I.G. Zou Y. Lloyd R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1905-1909Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, NER has been implicated in the repair of DPC lesions for only a select number of DPC-inducing agents, possibly suggesting that recombinational pathways participate in the cellular response to DPCs. Furthermore, the active removal of formaldehyde-induced DPCs in human cells is inhibited upon treatment with lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor (16Quievryn G. Zhitkovich A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1573-1580Google Scholar). Thus, an attractive model for the repair of DPC lesions may include the targeting for proteolysis of proteins that have become covalently attached to DNA (16Quievryn G. Zhitkovich A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1573-1580Google Scholar). Although it remains to be confirmed that Schiff base-mediated cross-links represent biologically significant chemical linkages, the ability to generate site-specific DNA-peptide cross-links now provides a tool to evaluate the repair model described above. Specifically, the cross-links generated in this study may represent mimics of biologically relevant DNA-peptide complexes that may exist as intermediates along a pathway of repair for DPCs. Experiments are currently underway to test this model.

Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Google Scholar, 20Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 277-290Google Scholar). Acrolein and crotonaldehyde are known carcinogens and pose an environmental health risk as constituents of automotive exhaust and tobacco smoke (21Beauchamp Jr., R.O. Andjelkovich D.A. Kligerman A.D.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 581-584Google Scholar); however, because these 2-alkenals cause damage to a multitude of cellular macromolecules, what role DPC formation plays in their observed mutagenic and carcinogenic effects is as yet unclear. Likewise, although the formation of 4-hydroxynonenal-derived protein adducts has been correlated with degenerative conditions such as cardiovascular and Parkinson's diseases (23Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Google Scholar, 24Yoritaka A. Hattori N. Uchida K. Tanaka M. Stadtman E.R. Mizuno Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the case of formaldehyde- and malondialdehyde-induced DPCs, the sequence of reactivity in cross-link formation appears to involve a rapid primary reaction to form a protein adduct, followed by a slower secondary reaction with DNA amines to form a DPC (25Ohba Y. Morimitsu Y. Watarai A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 285-293Google Scholar, 26Voitkun V. Zhitkovich A. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 97-106Google Scholar). However, the detection of stable acrolein-, crotonaldehyde-, and 4-hydroxynonenal-derived DNA adducts in vivo (27Nath R.G. Chung F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We report here that the cold inducibility of gene expression inSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was enhanced by the rigidification of membrane lipids that was engineered by disruption of genes for fatty acid desaturases. DNA microarray analysis revealed that cold-inducible genes could be divided into three groups according to the effects of the rigidification of membrane lipids. The first group included genes whose expression was not induced by cold in wild-type cells but became strongly cold-inducible upon rigidification of membrane lipids. This group included certain heat-shock genes, genes for subunits of the sulfate transport system, and the hik34gene for a histidine kinase. The second group consisted of genes whose cold inducibility was moderately enhanced by the rigidification of membrane lipids. Most genes in this group encoded proteins of as yet unknown function. The third group consisted of genes whose cold inducibility was unaffected by the rigidification of membrane lipids. This group included genes for an RNA helicase and an RNA-binding protein. DNA microarray analysis also indicated that the rigidification of membrane lipids had no effect on the heat inducibility of gene expression. Hik33, a cold-sensing histidine kinase, regulated the expression of most genes in the second and third groups but of only a small number of genes in the first group, an observation that suggests that the cold-inducible expression of genes in the first group might be regulated by a cold sensor that remains to be identified.

Fourier transform infrared 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid open reading frame Poikilothermic organisms respond to changes in ambient temperature by expressing specific sets of genes. Using DNA microarrays, we have demonstrated that a downward shift in temperature induces the expression of a large number of genes (1Suzuki I. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Kanehisa M. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 235-244Google Scholar), which include the rbp1 gene for an RNA-binding protein (2Sato N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2161-2167Google Scholar) and thecrhL gene for an RNA helicase (3Chamot D. Magee W.C. Yu E. Owttrim G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1728-1732Google Scholar), inSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafterSynechocystis). These genes are known as cold-inducible genes. Cold shock also represses the expression of another set of genes, known as cold-repressible genes, which includes genes for subunits of phycobilisomes and photosystem I (1Suzuki I. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Kanehisa M. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 235-244Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the membrane rigidity might be involved in the sensing of low temperatures (4Murata N. Los D.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 875-879Google Scholar, 5Los D.A. Murata N. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://stke/sciencemag.org/cig/content/full/oc_sigtrans:2000/62/pe1)Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that the expression in Synechocystis of the desA gene, a cold-inducible gene that encodes the Δ12 fatty acid desaturase, is induced by the rigidification of plasma membrane that results from the Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation of membrane lipids (6Vigh L. Los D.A. Horváth I. Murata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9090-9094Google Scholar). We identified a membrane-bound histidine kinase, Hik33, as a cold sensor inSynechocystis (7Suzuki I. Los D.A. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Murata N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1327-1334Google Scholar), and we postulated that Hik33 might detect decreases in temperature by sensing the rigidification of membrane lipids. Moreover, mutation of the hik33 gene (Δhik33) abolished the regulation of expression upon cold shock of many, but not all, of the cold-inducible and cold-repressible genes. These findings suggest that Synechocystis might have another cold sensor(s) that has not yet been identified (1Suzuki I. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Kanehisa M. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 235-244Google Scholar). We have produced a series of mutants of Synechocystis in which the extent of unsaturation of fatty acids is modified in a stepwise manner (8Tasaka Y. Gombos Z. Nishiyama Y. Mohanty P. Ohba T. Ohki K. Murata N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6416-6425Google Scholar). In one of these mutants, the desA anddesD genes, which encode the Δ12 and Δ6 fatty acid desaturases, respectively, are both inactive as a result of targeted mutagenesis. Cells of thedesA−/desD− double mutant synthesize only a saturated C16 fatty acid and a mono-unsaturated C18 fatty acid, regardless of growth temperature, whereas wild-type cells synthesize di-unsaturated and tri-unsaturated C18 fatty acids in addition to the mono-unsaturated C18 fatty acid (8Tasaka Y. Gombos Z. Nishiyama Y. Mohanty P. Ohba T. Ohki K. Murata N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6416-6425Google Scholar). Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the replacement of polyunsaturated fatty acids by the mono-unsaturated fatty acid indesA−/desD− cells raised the temperature at which the phase separation of lipids is initiated in thylakoid membranes (8Tasaka Y. Gombos Z. Nishiyama Y. Mohanty P. Ohba T. Ohki K. Murata N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6416-6425Google Scholar). However, in the cited studies, we did not examine effects of the double mutation of the desAand desD genes on the fluidity of membrane lipids at physiological temperatures. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)1 spectrometry is useful for studies of the organization of acyl lipids in both model membranes (9Mantsch H.H. McElhaney R.N. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 57: 213-226Google Scholar, 10Mendelsohn R. Senak L. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Biomolecular Spectroscopy, Part A. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1993: 339-380Google Scholar) and biological membranes (11Moore D.J. Mendelsohn R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4080-4085Google Scholar, 12Moore D.J. Sills R.H. Mendelsohn R. Biospectroscopy. 1995; 1: 133-140Google Scholar). Lipid disorganization and changes in membrane dynamics are characterized by shifts in the frequency of the νsymCH2stretching mode at around 2852 cm−1. In the νsymCH2 band, the contributions of thetrans and gauche segments of fatty-acyl chains can be separated. Thus, the actual frequency of the νsymCH2 stretching mode can be interpreted in terms of thermally induced changes in the dynamics of membrane lipids and of protein-lipid interactions (13Kóta Z. Debreczeny M. Szalontai B. Biospectroscopy. 1999; 5: 169-178Google Scholar). In the present study, FTIR spectrometry revealed that the double mutation of the desA and desD genes rigidified the plasma membrane of Synechocystis at physiological temperatures. We performed DNA microarray analysis to examine the effects of the membrane rigidification on the regulation of gene expression upon exposure of cells to cold and heat stress. We observed that the rigidification of membrane lipids enhanced the cold inducibility of a number of genes, whereas the rigidification did not affect the heat inducibility of gene expression. These findings suggest that the rigidification of membrane lipids might be a signal of cold perception that leads to the enhanced expression of certain genes. The wild-type and desA−/desD− strains of Synechocystis were obtained as described previously (8Tasaka Y. Gombos Z. Nishiyama Y. Mohanty P. Ohba T. Ohki K. Murata N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6416-6425Google Scholar). ThedesA−/desD−/hik33−strain was generated by inactivating the hik33 gene indesA−/desD− cells as described previously (7Suzuki I. Los D.A. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Murata N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1327-1334Google Scholar). Cells were grown photoautotrophically at 34 °C under illumination from incandescent lamps at 70 ॖmol photons m−2 s−1 in BG-11 medium, with aeration by air that contained 17 CO2 (14Ono T. Murata N. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 176-181Google Scholar). At the exponential phase of growth (when the optical density at 750 nm of the culture was 0.3), 50-ml aliquots were withdrawn and incubated under standard growth conditions, with the exception of the growth temperature or with the addition of benzylalcohol to a final concentration of 30 mm. The duration of incubation was 30 min for cold shock, 10 min for heat shock, and 20 min for benzylalcohol shock. FTIR spectra were recorded at a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1 with an FTIR spectrometer (Magna 560; Nicolet, Madison, WI) as described previously (15Szalontai B. Nishiyama Y. Gombos Z. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 409-419Google Scholar). Plasma membranes and thylakoid membranes were isolated from Synechocystis cells that had been grown at 34 °C as described previously (16Murata N. Omata T. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 245-251Google Scholar). Membranes, suspended in 10 mm TES-NaOH (pH 7.0) that contained 10 mm NaCl, were collected by centrifugation at 500,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in the identical but D2O-based buffer. The difference of 0.4 pH units between pH and pD was taken into account. We analyzed FTIR spectra using the SPSERV© software package (version 3.20, BCS Software; Dr. Csaba Bagyinka, Institute of Biophysics, Biological Research Center of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged, Hungary). The accuracy of determinations of frequencies of component bands was better than 0.1 cm−1 in the C-H stretching region. 50-ml aliquots of cell cultures, after incubation under designated conditions, were mixed, immediately after withdrawal from the main cultures, with an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol that contained 57 (w/v) phenol for rapid killing of cells and to prevent degradation of mRNA. After collection of the killed cells by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, total RNA was isolated by the hot-phenol method, as described previously (17Los D.A. Ray M.K. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1167-1175Google Scholar). The RNA was treated with DNase I (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) to remove contaminating DNA. The mRNA in each preparation of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in the presence of Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Reverse transcription was performed in a 40-ॖl reaction mixture that contained 10 ॖg of total RNA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 10 mm KCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dATP, 0.5 mm dCTP, 0.5 mm dGTP, 0.2 mm dTTP, 300 pmol of random hexamers, 0.1 mm Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP, 100 units of RNase inhibitor, and 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Takara Shuzo, Tokyo, Japan). The reaction mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNAs were purified on a CENTRI-SEP spin column (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ) and concentrated, prior to hybridization, by precipitation in ethanol. SynechocystisDNA microarrays (CyanoCHIP) were obtained from Takara Shuzo. The microarray covered 3079 genes (947 of the total genes, including 89 insertion sequences of transposons in Synechocystis) (18Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Google Scholar). The microarrays were incubated first at 65 °C for 1 h in a solution that contained 4× SSC (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), 0.27 SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and 100 ng ॖl−1 salmon sperm DNA. The microarrays were then rinsed once in 2× SSC and once in 0.2× SSC at room temperature. For hybridization, 25 ॖl of a mixture that contained Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNAs, 4× SSC, 0.27 SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 ng ॖl−1 salmon sperm DNA were heated at 95 °C for 2 min and placed on each microarray. Then the microarrays were incubated overnight at 65 °C. After hybridization, microarrays were washed for 10 min in 2× SSC at 60 °C and for 10 min in 0.2× SSC plus 0.17 SDS at 60 °C. Finally, they were rinsed in 0.2× SSC at room temperature. Fluorescence from microarrays was examined with a microarray reader (GMS 418 Array Scanner; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Intensities of individual signals were determined with ImaGeneTM version 4.1 software (BioDiscovery, Los Angeles, CA). DNA fragments for use as probes in Northern blotting analysis of the expression of the hspA,dnaK2, crhL, and rbp1 genes were prepared by amplification of fragments that corresponded to the complete coding sequences of the individual genes by the polymerase chain reaction. These sequences were downloaded from the Cyanobase (available at www.kazusa.or.jp). The DNA probe for 16 S rRNA was obtained by excision of a 600-bp XbaI/KpnI fragment that included the gene for 16 S rRNA of Anabaena variabilis from plasmid pAN4 (kindly provided by Dr. A. Glatz, Institute of Biochemistry, Biological Research Center, Szeged, Hungary). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a BcaBEST labeling kit (Takara Shuzo). Total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in an agarose gel prepared with formaldehyde. Bands of RNA were transferred to a nylon membrane (Gene Screen Plus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and allowed to hybridize with specific DNA probes. After hybridization, probes were removed and membranes were allowed to hybridize with the probe for 16 S rRNA (17Los D.A. Ray M.K. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1167-1175Google Scholar). Results were quantified with an image analyzer (BAS Station 2000 Image Analyzer; Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). It has been proposed that inactivation of fatty acid desaturases inSynechocystis rigidifies the cell membranes (8Tasaka Y. Gombos Z. Nishiyama Y. Mohanty P. Ohba T. Ohki K. Murata N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6416-6425Google Scholar). We employed FTIR spectrometry for direct measurements of the rigidity of plasma membranes from wild-type anddesA−/desD− cells that had been grown at 34 °C. Fig. 1 shows the shift in the frequency of the νsymCH2stretching mode as a function of temperature. The concordant data were calculated from FTIR spectra that had been recorded as the temperature was increased in steps of 2–3 °C. In FTIR spectra, higher frequencies represent higher proportions of gauche segments in fatty-acyl chains of membrane lipids, which might originate from the thermally induced disorder of fatty-acyl chains and/or from protein-lipid interactions (13Kóta Z. Debreczeny M. Szalontai B. Biospectroscopy. 1999; 5: 169-178Google Scholar). Because the ratio of proteins to lipids in thylakoid membranes and plasma membranes is unaffected by the inactivation of fatty acid desaturases (8Tasaka Y. Gombos Z. Nishiyama Y. Mohanty P. Ohba T. Ohki K. Murata N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6416-6425Google Scholar, 15Szalontai B. Nishiyama Y. Gombos Z. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 409-419Google Scholar), the temperature-dependent changes in the νsymCH2 stretching vibrations of plasma membranes from wild-type anddesA−/desD− cells, as shown in Fig. 1, should have corresponded, to a good approximation, to changes in the disorder of fatty-acyl chains in the membrane lipids. A lower frequency of the νsymCH2 stretching mode at a given temperature should correspond to a more ordered (rigidified) state. Thus, our results indicate that the plasma membranes fromdesA−/desD− cells were more rigid than those from wild-type cells, in particular at 22 °C, the temperature at which we examined the expression of cold-regulated genes (see below). This rigidification of plasma membranes by the mutation of fatty acid desaturases reflected the lack of polyunsaturated fatty-acyl chains indesA−/desD− cells. The difference between wild-type and mutant cells was greater at lower temperatures and was smaller at higher temperatures. Our FTIR analysis indicated that lipids in plasma membranes were rigidified with decreases in temperature and that the rigidification was enhanced by the saturation of fatty acids that occurred after the inactivation of fatty acid desaturases. We used DNA microarrays to examine the effects of membrane rigidification on the expression of genes in response to cold in Synechocystis. Fig. 2 shows the changes in gene expression in wild-type anddesA−/desD− cells after incubation at 22 °C for 30 min that followed growth at 34 °C. Data points above the upper reference line and below the lower reference line correspond, respectively, to genes whose expression was significantly enhanced or repressed by cold. In wild-type cells, cold shock enhanced the expression of 168 genes and repressed that of 89 genes (Fig. 2A). IndesA−/desD− cells, in addition to the same set of 168 cold-inducible genes, 96 additional genes appeared above the upper reference line (Fig. 2B). The results indicate that the rigidification of membrane lipids enhanced the response of gene expression to cold in Synechocystis. The expression of the cold-repressible genes was not significantly affected by the double mutation of the desA anddesD genes. Under isothermal conditions, the double mutation had no significant effect on gene expression (data not shown). Table I shows the numerical results of DNA microarray analysis for genes that were strongly induced by cold in either wild-type ordesA−/desD− cells (namely, when the ratio of levels of expression in treated cells and control cells was greater than three). These cold-inducible genes could be divided into three groups according to the effects of the double mutation. The first group consisted of genes that were not induced by cold in wild-type cells but were strongly cold-inducible indesA−/desD− cells. These genes included certain heat-shock genes, such as hspA,dnaK2, and clpB2; the sbpA,cysA, cysT, and cysW genes for the sulfate-transport system; the sigB gene for an RNA polymerase sigma factor; the hik34 gene for a histidine kinase; and the pbp gene for a putative penicillin-binding protein. The second group consisted of genes whose cold inducibility was moderately enhanced by the double mutation, and it includedhli genes for high light-inducible proteins and several genes for proteins of as yet unknown function. The third group consisted of genes whose cold inducibility was unaffected by the double mutation and included genes known as cold-shock genes, such asrbp1 (2Sato N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2161-2167Google Scholar) and crhL (3Chamot D. Magee W.C. Yu E. Owttrim G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1728-1732Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the cold-responsive expression of the genes in these three groups might be regulated by different mechanisms with respect to membrane rigidity.Table IResults of DNA microarray analysis of changes in the stress-induced expression of genes due to rigidification of membrane lipidsORFGeneProduct22 °C/34 °C42 °C/34 °CWTA−D−A−D−33WTA−D−Group 1.

The induction of genes in the first group might require a higher degree of rigidification of membrane lipids than the cold responses of genes in the second and third groups. The cold induction of heat-shock proteins has been observed in wild-type cells of another strain of cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (hereafterSynechococcus). Porankiewicz and Clarke (20Porankiewicz J. Clarke A.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5111-5117Google Scholar) demonstrated that, at low temperatures, Synechococcus synthesizes a homolog of ClpB, a member of the Clp/HSP100 family of heat-shock proteins. Synechococcus synthesizes only saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids but no polyunsaturated fatty acids (21Murata N. Wada H. Gombos Z. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 933-941Google Scholar), resembling thedesA−/desD− mutant ofSynechocystis. It is likely, therefore, that the cold inducibility of certain heat-shock genes is related to a lack of polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane lipids. The rigidification of membrane lipids did not enhance the cold inducibility of genes in the third group, perhaps because the membrane rigidity in wild-type cells is sufficiently high at low temperatures for the maximum induction of these genes. To verify the results in Fig. 2 and Table I, we examined the levels of expression of the hspA, dnaK2, rbp1, and crhL genes by Northern blot analysis (Figs. 3 and4). The expression of the hspAand dnaK2 genes was induced by cold indesA−/desD− cells, with maximum induction at 24 °C, and such induction was not observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the results of microarray analysis. However, the difference between the two types of cell was more apparent after Northern blot analysis than after microarray analysis. By contrast, the cold inducibility of therbp1 and crhL genes was unaffected by the double mutation (Fig. 4). Maximum induction of the rbp1 gene was observed at 25 °C, whereas that of the crhL gene was observed at ∼20 °C. The reason for the difference between therbp1 and crhL genes in terms of the temperature for maximum induction is unclear.Figure 4Northern blotting analysis of the cold-induced expression of the rbp1 andcrhL genes in wild-type (WT) anddesA−/desD−(A−D−) cells.

The three different mutants in the first extracellular domain of human ABCA1 associated with Tangier disease, R587W, W590S, and Q597R, were examined for their subcellular localization and function by using ABCA1-GFP fusion protein stably expressed in HEK293 cells. ABCA1-GFP expressed in HEK293 was fully functional for apoA-I-mediated HDL assembly. Immunostaining and confocal microscopic analyses demonstrated that ABCA1-GFP was mainly localized to the plasma membrane (PM) but also substantially in intracellular compartments. All three mutant ABCA1-GFPs showed no or little apoA-I-mediated HDL assembly. R587W and Q597R were associated with impaired processing of oligosaccharide from high mannose type to complex type and failed to be localized to the PM, whereas W590S did not show such dysfunctions. Vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping was examined to elucidate the mechanism for the dysfunction in the W590S mutant. Photoaffinity labeling of W590S with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was stimulated by adding ortho-vanadate in the presence of Mn2+as much as in the presence of wild-type ABCA1. These results suggest that the defect of HDL assembly in R587W and Q597R is due to the impaired localization to the PM, whereas W590S has a functional defect other than the initial ATP binding and hydrolysis.

The same pathway may also remove cholesterol that has pathologically accumulated in the cells such as an initial stage of atherosclerosis. Assembly of high density lipoprotein (HDL)1particles by helical apolipoproteins with cellular lipid has been recognized as one of the major mechanisms for cellular cholesterol release (1Hara H.

The importance of this active cholesterol-releasing pathway in regulating cholesterol homeostasis became apparent by the finding that it is impaired in the cells from patients with Tangier disease, a genetic deficiency of circulating HDL (3Francis G.A.

Although direct interaction between ABCA1 and apoA-I at the cell surface has been suggested on the basis of chemical cross-linking experiments (8Oram J. Lawn R. Garvin M. Wade D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Google Scholar, 9Wang N. Silver D. Costet P. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Google Scholar), an indirect role of ABCA1 in the apoA-I binding to the cell was also proposed by a model that ABCA1 induces phosphatidylserine exofacial flopping to generate the microenvironment required for the docking of apoA-I at the cell surface (10Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Google Scholar).

We and Fitzgerald et al. (16Tanaka A. Ikeda Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Sadanami K. Kidera A. Nakagawa S. Nagase T. Aoki R. Kioka N. Amachi T. Yokoyama S. Ueda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To investigate the mechanistic background for these mutations to cause the dysfunction of ABCA1, we characterized the function and subcellular localization of ABCA1-GFP and its TD mutants stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Three TD mutants (R587W, W590S, Q597R), clustered in ECD1, were examined in the present report. Immunostaining and confocal microscopic analysis showed that ABCA1 is mainly localized to the plasma membrane (PM), where ECD1 is expected to be exposed to the outside of the cell, but also in intracellular compartments to a substantial extent. The TD mutations in ECD1 resulted in a distinct influence on the function and subcellular localization of ABCA1. All three mutants were functionally impaired for the apoA-I-mediated HDL assembly. On the other hand, the two mutants R587W and Q597R were only partially or scarcely localized to the PM, whereas W590S was localized to the PM as efficiently as the wild type. Vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping was examined to elucidate the mechanism for the dysfunction in the W590S mutant. Anti-GFP antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, or Nacalai Tesque. The putative extracellular domain ECD1, amino acids 45–639 of human ABCA1, was expressed as a C terminus His tag fusion protein inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by Ni2+chromatography (Qiagen). A rat polyclonal antibody, generated using this His tag-fused ECD1, specifically interacted with human ABCA1 stably or transiently expressed in HEK293 cells in Western blotting (data not shown) and immunostaining (see Fig. 1). Cells were grown on a 35-mm glass-base dish (Iwaki). The cells were incubated with primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk. After being washed, these cells were incubated with the fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies. The cells were directly viewed with ×100 Plan-NEOFLUAR oil immersion objective on a Zeiss confocal microscope LSM510. DNA fragments (XhoI-BclI) containing each missense TD mutation (R587W, W590S, or Q597R) were generated using the polymerase chain reaction method with R587W (XhoI) primer (5′-GTCCTCGAGCTGACCCCTTTGAGGACATGTGGTACGTC-3′), W590S (XhoI) primer (5′-GTCCTCGAGCTGACCCCTTTGAGGACATGCGGTACGTCTCGGGGGGCTTC-3′), or Q597 (XhoI) primer (5′-GTCCTCGAGCTGACCCCTTTGAGGACATGCGGTACGTCTGGGGGGGCTTCGCCTACTTGCGGGATGTGGTG-3′), where the mutated nucleotide is underlined, and BclI primer (5′-CGATGCCCTTGATGATCACAGCCACTGAG-3′).

In brief, 10 μg of membrane proteins from HEK293 cells stably expressing the wild-type, R587W, W590S, or Q597R ABCA1-GFP were treated with 500 units of Endo H or 0.3 units of PNGaseF for 1 h at 37 °C. The deglycosylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%) and analyzed by immunoblotting by using the anti-GFP antibody. Cells were subcultured in 6-well plates (TPP, 92406) at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells in a 1/1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium (DF) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in the same medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 μg/ml apoA-I. The lipid content in the medium was determined after a 24-h incubation as described previously (19Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Hiroyuki Aburatani E. Vance D. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11092-11099Google Scholar). To compare lipid release from HEK293 cells transiently expressing ABCA1-GFP, GFP fluorescence of transfected cells was measured with a FL600 fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.) (19Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Hiroyuki Aburatani E. Vance D. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11092-11099Google Scholar), and expression levels of the wild-type and mutant ABCA1-GFP were normalized with GFP fluorescence. Expression levels of the wild-type and mutant ABCA1-GFP were in a range of ±20%. A membrane fraction (20–30 μg) was prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing the wild-type or W590S ABCA1-GFP. It was incubated with 15 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, 2 mm ouabain, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 6 μl for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 1 mm ortho-vanadate and 3 mmMgSO4 or MnCl2. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of ice-cold 40 mm Tris-Cl buffer containing 0.1 mm EGTA and 1 mm MgSO4or MnCl2. The supernatant containing unbound ATP was removed from the membrane pellet after centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 5 min, 2 °C), and this procedure was repeated once more. The pellets were resuspended in 8 μl of TE buffer containing 1 mm MgSO4 or MnCl2 and irradiated for 5 min (at 254 nm, 8.2 mW/cm2) on ice. The sample was analyzed by autoradiogram after electrophoresis in a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Experiments were done in triplicate. In our previous report, we have shown that the hemagglutinin epitope inserted between residues 207 and 208 of human ABCA1 was recognized by the anti-hemagglutinin antibody from the outside of cells (16Tanaka A. Ikeda Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Sadanami K. Kidera A. Nakagawa S. Nagase T. Aoki R. Kioka N. Amachi T. Yokoyama S. Ueda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 1019-1025Google Scholar). To confirm the extracellular localization of the hydrophilic domain containing residue 207 (ECD1), non-permeabilized HEK293 cells were incubated with a rat polyclonal antibody against the protein corresponding to amino acids 45–639 of human ABCA1 for immunostaining. ABCA1-GFP, which was apparently on the cell surface, was visualized by the antibody, whereas the protein in the intracellular compartments was not (Fig.1). The results suggested that ABCA1-GFP was localized to the PM and the intracellular compartments, and the ECD1 domain of ABCA1 on the PM was exposed to outside of the cells. Many mutations in patients with TD and FHA have been identified in ECD1 of ABCA1, and three mutations (R587W, W590S, Q597R) cluster in the vicinity between amino acids 587 and 597 (20Schmitz G. Kaminski W.E. Orso E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 493-501Google Scholar)(Fig.2 A). To study the role of ECD1 domain in the HDL assembly function of ABCA1, we introduced these three TD mutations in ECD1 into ABCA1-GFP and transiently or stably expressed in HEK293. The expression levels of mutant ABCA1-GFP stably expressed in HEK293 cells were comparable with that of the wild-type ABCA1-GFP as shown later in Figs. 3 and 5. Confocal microscopic examination revealed that R587W and Q597R appeared to be localized mainly in the ER and not to the PM (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, W590S was localized to the PM as much as the wild-type ABCA1-GFP was, although more was found with intracellular vesicles than with the wild type (Fig. 2 B). Immunostaining with the antibody against ECD1 confirmed the proper orientation of W590S (Fig.2 C).Figure 3Glycosylation of ABCA1-GFP. The wild-type (WT), R587W, W590S, and Q597R ABCA1-GFP were treated with none (−), Endo H (H), or PNGaseF (F) and separated with 7% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was done with anti-GFP antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Vanadate-induced trapping in ABCA1-GFP.

Membranes (20 μg) prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing the wild-type (WT) ABCA1-GFP (lanes 3, 4, 7, 8,11, and 12) or from untransfected HEK293 cells (HEK) (lanes 1, 2, 5,6, 9, and 10) were incubated with 15 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of 1 mm ortho-vanadate (Vi) and 3 mm MgSO4 (lanes 5–8) or MnCl2 (lanes 9–12) for 15 min at 37 °C. Proteins were photoaffinity-labeled with UV irradiation after removal of unbound ligands and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, immunoblots of membranes prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing the wild-type (4 μg,lane 1) or W590S (6 μg, lane 2) ABCA1-GFP or from untransfected HEK293 cells (6 μg, lane 3). Proteins were separated on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and reacted with monoclonal antibody against GFP. C, membranes prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing the wild type (WT) (20 μg,lanes 1 and 2) or W590S (30 μg, lanes 3 and 4) were incubated with 15 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of 1 mm ortho-vanadate (Vi) and 3 mm MnCl2 for 15 min at 37 °C. Proteins were photoaffinity-labeled with UV irradiation after removal of unbound ligands and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Glycosylation of the wild-type ABCA1-GFP and its mutants R587W, W590S, and Q597R was examined by the treatment with PNGaseF and Endo H (Fig. 3 A). Endo H cleaves two proximal N-acetylglucosamine residues of the high mannose type but not of the complex type, whereas PNGaseF cleaves sugar chains of both the high mannose and complex types. The treatment with PNGaseF increased the electrophoretic mobilities of 280-kDa ABCA1 to produce the 250-kDa protein, the deglycosylated form of ABCA1-GFP. ABCA1 with TD mutations, R587W and Q597R ABCA1-GFP, was sensitive to Endo H to produce the deglycosylated form of ABCA1-GFP, whereas the wild-type ABCA1-GFP was little digested by Endo H. These results indicated that R587W and Q597R ABCA1-GFP did not contain complex oligosaccharides and supported the confocal microscopy observation, which suggested the localization of these two TD mutants in the ER or the cis-Golgi complex. On the other hand, W590S ABCA1-GFP was resistant to Endo H, indicating that it does not contain high mannose oligosaccharides but contains complex oligosaccharides and reached the trans-Golgi complex. To analyze the functional consequences of these mutations, apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol and choline-phospholipid was examined from the stable transformants (Fig.4, A and B). The wild-type ABCA1-GFP exported 0.14 ± 0.01 and 1.14 ± 0.07 μg of cholesterol from cells grown in 6-well plates in the absence and presence of apoA-I, respectively, and 1.99 ± 0.25 and 5.88 ± 0.13 μg of choline-phospholipids, respectively, to generate HDL in the medium by reducing about 15% of cell cholesterol. The R587W mutation resulted in the apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol and choline-phospholipids to 24 and 23% of the wild-type ABCA1-GFP, respectively. The Q597R mutant almost completely lost this activity. The results were apparently consistent with the inefficient localization to the cell surface of ABCA1-GFP with these mutations. The apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol and choline-phospholipids from HEK293 expressing W590S ABCA1-GFP were 7.4 and 13%, respectively, of those expressing the wild-type ABCA1-GFP, although W590S ABCA1-GFP was localized to the PM as efficiently as the wild type. The apoA-I-mediated release of cellular cholesterol and choline-phospholipids was also examined with HEK293 transiently expressing the wild-type and mutant ABCA1-GFPs (Fig. 4, Cand D). The results were similar to those observed with the stable transformants shown in Fig. 4, A andB. To elucidate the mechanism for the loss of function of ABCA1 in the W590S mutant, we examined the interaction of ABCA1-GFP with ATP. Among membrane proteins of the cells expressing the wild-type ABCA1-GFP, a 280-kDa protein was specifically photoaffinity-labeled with ATP (Fig.5 A, lane 7), whereas no protein was labeled in the untransfected HEK293 cells (lane 5). The mobility of the photoaffinity-labeled membrane protein in SDS-PAGE was identical to that of the wild-type ABCA1-GFP visualized by Western blotting (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). The photoaffinity labeling was negative when the samples were incubated in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 5 A, lane 3), indicating that 8-azido-[α-32P] ATP tightly binds to ABCA1 in the presence of Mg2+. Multidrug transporters, MDR1 (ABCB1), MRP1 (ABCC1), and MRP2 (ABCC2), are known to trap Mg-ADP in the presence of ortho-vanadate, an analog of phosphate, and form a stable inhibitory intermediate during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Photoaffinity labeling of these proteins with 8-azido-[α-32P] ATP is therefore stimulated when the membrane containing these proteins reacts with the nucleotide in the presence of ortho-vanadate (21Taguchi Y. Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 11-14Google Scholar, 22Takada Y. Yamada K. Taguchi Y. Kino K. Matsuo M. Tucker S.J. Komano T. Amachi T. Ueda K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 131-136Google Scholar, 23Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Google Scholar, 24Hashimoto K. Uchiumi T. Konno T. Ebihara T. Nakamura T. Wada M. Sakisaka S. Maniwa F. Amachi T. Ueda K. Kuwano M. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 1236-1245Google Scholar). We thus expected that ortho-vanadate would stimulate photoaffinity labeling of ABCA1. However, no increase of photoaffinity labeling of ABCA1 was observed (lane 8) in comparison with that in the absence of ortho-vanadate (lane 7). Vanadate did not induce nucleotide trapping in MRP6 (ABCC6) in the presence of Mg2+, but it did with Ni2+ ions (25Cai J. Daoud R. Alqawi O. Georges E. Pelletier J. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8058-8067Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined photoaffinity labeling of ABCA1-GFP in the presence of other metal ions. Significant stimulation was observed with wild-type ABCA1-GFP by ortho-vanadate in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 5 A, lanes 11 and12). These results suggested that Mn-ATP was hydrolyzed at NBFs of ABCA1, and a stable inhibitory complex ABCA1-MnADP-Vi was formed during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. To determine whether the W590S mutation affects the ATP hydrolysis cycle of ABCA1, vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping in W590S ABCA1-GFP was examined in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 5 C). Membrane proteins from HEK293 cells expressing a similar amount of wild-type ABCA1 or W590S ABCA1-GFP (Fig. 5 B) were incubated with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the absence or presence ofortho-vanadate. The photoaffinity labeling of W590S ABCA1-GFP was stimulated by adding ortho-vanadate in the presence of Mn2+ as much as in the presence of the wild type. In this work, we described the influence of three clustered mutations in ECD1 associated with TD and FHA on the subcellular localization of ABCA1, apoA-I-mediated HDL assembly, apoA-I binding, and vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping. Immunostaining of ABCA1-GFP stably expressed in HEK293 cells revealed that ABCA1-GFP apparently resided on the cell surface as well as in intracellular compartments in agreement with previous reports (18Fitzgerald M.L.

Although the three mutations all reduced apoA-I-mediated lipid release and subsequent HDL assembly from HEK293 cells expressing ABCA1-GFP, whether transiently or stably, the mutants demonstrated differential behavior with respect to their subcellular localization. ABCA1-GFP with a R587W or Q597R mutation appeared to be impaired with intracellular trafficking and predominantly localized in the ER. On the other hand, W590S ABCA1-GFP was mainly localized to the PM as much as the wild-type ABCA1 was. The sensitivity to Endo H of the mutant ABCA1s was consistent with the their apparent impairment of intracellular trafficking. R587W and Q597 ABCA1-GFP contained high mannose oligosaccharides, indicating that they do not reach the trans-Golgi complex. In contrast, W590S ABCA1-GFP contained complex-type oligosaccharides as the wild-type does. When the cells were treated with monensin, which prevents the delivery of protein from endosomes to the cell surface, after inhibiting protein synthesis by treatment with cycloheximide, ABCA1-GFP on the cell surface decreased, and the vesicular localization increased instead (see supplementary data, Fig. 1).2 When the cells were treated with brefeldin A, which blocks vesicular transport from the ER to the Golgi and to the cell surface along with the secretary pathway (29Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Google Scholar), the newly synthesized ABCA1-GFP was accumulated in the fused Golgi-ER, the amount of ABCA1-GFP on the PM was reduced, and the vesicles containing ABCA1-GFP were observed (see supplementary data 1).2 ABCA1-GFP was co-localized partly with Vti1b, a marker for the Golgi, with EEA1, a marker for early endosomes, and with lysotracker, a marker for acidic compartments (see supplementary data 2).2 These results suggested that newly synthesized ABCA1-GFP was first delivered to the PM through the ER and the Golgi and then shuttled rapidly between the PM and the intracellular vesicles, mainly the early endosomes. R587W and Q597R ABCA1-GFP appeared to be retained in the ER. It has been reported that one amino acid (Phe-508) deletion of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the major mutation in cystic fibrosis patients that causes misfolding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, is degraded by the proteasome pathway before exiting from the ER (30Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Google Scholar). This region (R587 to Q597) in ECD1 would be critical for proper folding of ABCA1 and would probably affect the intracellular translocation process, whereas the W590S mutation does not. Fitzgerald et al. (17Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S. Andersson L.P. Mendez A.J. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33178-33187Google Scholar) reported that R587W or Q597R mutation did not affect the PM localization but disrupted the direct interaction with ApoA-I. This supports a major conformational alteration of ECD1 by these mutations. The reason for the discrepancy of subcellular localization is unknown between their results with the mutant ABCA1 transiently expressed in a high amount in HEK293 and ours studied with the mutant ABCA1-GFP in the stable transformants with modest expression. W590S ABCA1-GFP was localized to the PM as much as the wild-type ABCA1-GFP when expressed in HEK293. However, apoA-I-mediated release of cellular cholesterol and choline-phospholipid was severely impaired. To elucidate the reason for this functional impairment in the W590S mutant, nucleotide interaction was examined with the wild-type and W590S ABCA1-GFP by using 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. The wild-type ABCA1-GFP was photoaffinity-labeled in the presence of Mg2+, but no vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping was observed, being consistent with human ABCA1 expressed in Sf9 insect cells (31Szakacs G. Langmann T. Ozvegy C. Orso E. Schmitz G. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1258-1264Google Scholar). Other transporter-type ABC proteins, such as MDR1 (ABCB1), MRP1 (ABCC1), and MRP2 (ABCC2), trap Mg-ADP in the presence ofortho-vanadate and form a stable inhibitory intermediate during the ATP hydrolysis cycle (21Taguchi Y. Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 11-14Google Scholar, 22Takada Y. Yamada K. Taguchi Y. Kino K. Matsuo M. Tucker S.J. Komano T. Amachi T. Ueda K. Biochim. Biophys.

Nakamura T. Wada M. Sakisaka S. Maniwa F. Amachi T. Ueda K. Kuwano M. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 1236-1245Google Scholar) so that ABCA1, showing no obvious vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping, was proposed not to be an active transporter but a regulator in apoA-I-dependent cholesterol release (31Szakacs G. Langmann T. Ozvegy C. Orso E. Schmitz G. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1258-1264Google Scholar). However, vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping was demonstrated to be positive with ABCA1 in the presence of Mn2+ in this study. Vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping did not occur in the presence of Mg2+ but can be detected with Ni2+ ions in MRP6 (ABCC6) (25Cai J. Daoud R. Alqawi O. Georges E. Pelletier J. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8058-8067Google Scholar), and it was detected in ABCG2 with Co2+ ions (32Ozvegy C. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar). MRP6 and ABCG2 have been shown to function as active transporters for an anionic cyclic pentapeptide BQ-123 (33Madon J. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Meier P.J. Stieger B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 634-641Google Scholar) and anticancer drugs (34Litman T. Druley T.E. Stein W.D. Bates S.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 931-959Google Scholar), respectively. These results suggest that ABCA1 may function as an active transporter in apoA-I-dependent cholesterol release. W590S ABCA1-GFP showed vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping in the presence of Mn2+. This suggests that the first catalytic reaction to form a stable inhibitory complex ABCA1-MnADP-Vi is not impaired by the mutation. It has been reported that apoA-I does not properly interact with ATP hydrolysis mutants of ABCA1 (10Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Google Scholar) and that apoA-I can be interacted with ABCA1-W590S as with the wild-type ABCA1 (17Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S. Andersson L.P. Mendez A.J. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33178-33187Google Scholar, 35Rigot V. Hamon Y. Chambenoit O. Alibert M. Duverger N. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2077-2086Google Scholar). These results suggest that W590S ABCA1-GFP possesses, at least, minimum ATPase activity, which supports apoA-I binding. W590S mutation may impair a step after the interaction with apoA-I, such as proper loading of phospholipid and/or cholesterol or proper release of apoA-I after phospholipid/cholesterol loading. More than 30 mutations have been mapped in the ABCA1 gene in patients with FHA and TD (5Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S. Zhang L. Roomp K. van Dam M. Yu L. Brewer C. Collins J. Molhuizen H.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 433-441Google Scholar). One subgroup of the mutations is suggested to be associated with splenomegaly, and the other may be associated with coronary heart disease (20Schmitz G. Kaminski W.E. Orso E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 493-501Google Scholar). Many mutations have been located in ECD1 of ABCA1, and three missense mutations cluster in the vicinity between amino acids 587 and 597 in ECD1. Interestingly, clinical manifestations of these mutations are apparently different (20Schmitz G. Kaminski W.E. Orso E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 493-501Google Scholar): R587W is associated with coronary heart disease, whereas W590S is associated with splenomegaly. In this study, we demonstrated that the defect of HDL assembly in R587W and Q597R is due to the impaired localization of ABCA1 to the PM. Subcellular trafficking and vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping in the presence of Mn2+ were not impaired in ABCA1-GFP containing the W590S mutation so that W590S seems to have a different type of functional defect. Further characterization of TD mutations for the function of ABCA1 would facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanism for cellular cholesterol release and its homeostasis.

L1 achieved its high copy number by retrotransposition, a process that requires the two L1-encoded proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p. The role of ORF1p in the retrotransposition cycle is incompletely understood, but it is known to bind single-stranded nucleic acids and act as a nucleic acid chaperone. This study assesses the nature and specificity of the interaction of ORF1p with RNA. Results of coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that ORF1p preferentially binds a single T1 nuclease digestion product of 38 nucleotides (nt) within the full-length mouse L1 transcript. The 38-nt fragment is localized within L1 RNA and found to be sufficient for binding by ORF1p but not necessary, because its complement is also efficiently coimmunoprecipitated, as are all sequences 38 nt or longer. Results of nitrocellulose filter-binding assays demonstrate that the binding of ORF1p to RNA does not require divalent cations but is sensitive to the concentration of monovalent cation. Both sense and antisense transcripts bind with apparent K Ds in the low nanomolar range.

It belongs to one of the eleven ancient clades of non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons that are widely dispersed among eucaryotes (1Malik H.S. Burke W.D. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 793-805Google Scholar) and propagate by a unique mechanism, target-DNA primed reverse transcription (TPRT)1 (2Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Google Scholar). Although there are more than 100,000 copies of L1 in the mouse genome, the majority of these are truncated, rearranged, or mutated and therefore incapable of further retrotransposition (reviewed in Ref. 3Hutchison III, C.A. Hardies S.C. Loeb D.D. Shehee W.R. Edgell M.H. Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1989: 593-617Google Scholar). Only about 3,000 of the present-day L1 elements are likely to be able to generate progeny (4Goodier J.L. Ostertag E.M. Du K. Kazazian H.H.J. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1677-1685Google Scholar). Most of the transposition-competent mouse L1 elements belong to a subfamily known as TF, although elements belonging to the A and GF subfamilies are also active (4Goodier J.L. Ostertag E.M. Du K.

Evol. 2001; 52: 51-62Google Scholar). Successful retrotransposition of L1 requires the proteins encoded by both of its two long open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2 (5DeBerardinis R.J. Goodier J.L. Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 288-290Google Scholar, 10Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Boeke J.D. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Cell. 1996; 87: 917-927Google Scholar). The protein product of ORF2 (ORF2p) provides two enzymatic activities that are required for the TPRT reaction, endonuclease (11Feng Q. Moran J.V. Kazazian H.H.J. Boeke J.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 905-916Google Scholar) and reverse transcriptase (10Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Boeke J.D. Kazazian Jr., H.H.

The functions of the ORF1 protein product (ORF1p) in L1 retrotransposition are less clear but are likely to be structural rather than enzymatic (13Martin S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4804-4807Google Scholar, 14Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 467-475Google Scholar, 15Hohjoh H. Singer M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 630-639Google Scholar, 16Hohjoh H.

Gilbert N. Ooi S.L. Lawler J.F. Ostertag E.M. Kazazian H.H. Boeke J.D. Moran J.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1429-1439Google Scholar). The ORF1p present in extracts of mouse embryonal carcinoma cells cofractionates with full-length L1 RNA as a ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) (13Martin S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4804-4807Google Scholar). Mouse ORF1p, purified following expression inEscherichia coli, binds both single-stranded RNA and DNA (17Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10155-10160Google Scholar, 19Martin S.L. Li J. Weisz J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 11-20Google Scholar) and functions as a nucleic acid chaperone in vitro(14Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 467-475Google Scholar). In addition, ORF1p forms multimers via a coiled-coil domain (17Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10155-10160Google Scholar,19Martin S.L. Li J. Weisz J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 11-20Google Scholar). Both of these properties are likely to be important for RNP formation. ORF1p from human L1 shares the properties of protein-protein interaction and RNA binding with the mouse protein (15Hohjoh H. Singer M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 630-639Google Scholar). In contrast to the mouse protein, however, the ORF1p enriched from human cell extracts appeared not to bind single-stranded DNA or random sequence RNA. Instead, results obtained using a coimmunoprecipitation assay indicate that the human L1 ORF1p binds preferentially to two regions of human L1 RNA (16Hohjoh H. Singer M.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6034-6043Google Scholar). The experiments that led to these significantly different conclusions regarding the binding specificity of L1 ORF1p to RNA differed in several details, including sources of material, the methods of protein purification, and the biochemical assays utilized. Here we employ the coimmunoprecipitation assay of Hohjoh and Singer (16Hohjoh H. Singer M.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6034-6043Google Scholar) and introduce a quantitative nitrocellulose filter binding assay to address the specificity of the interaction between mouse L1 ORF1p and RNA. Results obtained from both the coimmunoprecipitation assay and the filter binding assay confirm that the mouse ORF1 proteins from TFand A-type L1 elements bind to RNA with high-affinity in a sequence-independent manner. The non-sequence-specific binding of RNA to ORF1p has significant implications for the function(s) of this protein during L1 retrotransposition. The region encoding ORF1 was amplified by PCR using primers ORF1-start (5′-ATCCGAGCTCGATGGCGAAAGGCAAACG-3′) and ORF1-end (5′-GGGGAATTCGCTGTCTTCTTTTTGGTTTGTTGA-3′) with pVK15 (20Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 270: 2868-2873Google Scholar) and pTN201 (6Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Moran J.V. Ostertag E.M. Kingsmore S.F. Seldin M.F. Hayashizaki Y. Martin S.L. Kazazian Jr., H.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 590-597Google Scholar) as templates for the A-type and TF-type elements, respectively. The amplified fragments were digested withSacI and EcoRI and then cloned intoSacI-EcoRI digested pBlueBacHis2B (Invitrogen). These clones, pBacORF1A and pBacORFTF, were used to produce the A and TF forms of ORF1p after the infection of SF9 cells, respectively. pSV1A was constructed by PCR amplification of the L1Md-A2 element (21Loeb D.D. Padgett R.W. Hardies S.C. Shehee W.R. Comer M.B. Edgell M.H. Hutchison III, C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 168-182Google Scholar) with primers 49 (5′-AGAACAGAATTCCAACTYTAACA-3′) and 5B (5′-CCTGTAAGCAGCAGAATG-3′). The product was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega). This plasmid was used as a template for in vitro transcription to produce transcripts F and G (Fig. 1). The double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide that corresponds to the 38-nt T1 nuclease product from L1 RNA (38 and c38 in 14) was cloned in both orientations into the blunted (T4 polymerase) ApaI site of pGEM-T-Easy after removing the vector's original EcoRI fragment. pJW5 contains the 38-nt fragment in the sense orientation but lost one nt in the upstream ApaI site relative to the antisense clone, pJW6. Digestion of these clones with NotI or NdeI produced templates for the transcription of the 76/77- or 110/111-nt MS and MA in Fig. 1. Note that the only sequence that differs between each sense and antisense pair is the region from L1; the appended vector sequences are constant. The DNA sequences of all cloned inserts were verified. Transcripts A–G and the 110/111- and 76/77-nt versions of MS and MA were generated by run-off in vitrotranscription using linearized plasmid DNA templates. Short transcripts, 43 nt each encompassing the 38-nt T1 nuclease-resistant fragment of mouse L1 (MS) and its complement (MC), were transcribed with T7 polymerase after annealing the T7 promoter primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATA-3′) to MS43 (5′-CATTGATATTAAGAGATATTAAGGAAAAGTAATTGTTGCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′) or MC (5′-GTAACTATAATTCTCTATAATTCCTTTTCATTAACAACCTCCCTATAG TGAGTCGTATTA-3′) oligonucleotides in transcription buffer. The 40-nt versions of the MS/MA region of L1 that were used for the filter binding assay were translated using fully double-stranded oligonucleotides as the transcription template to improve yields with T7 polymerase. MS40 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCAACAATTACTTTTCCTTAATATCTCTTAACATCAATG-3′) and MA (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCATTGATGTTAAGAGATATTAAGGAAAAGTAATTGTTG-3′) were annealed to their perfect complements. The underlined region denotes the minimal T7 promoter plus two extra G residues to improve yields in the T7 transcription reaction (22Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Google Scholar). SP6 and T7 transcripts were synthesized in vitro using MEGAscript or MEGAshortscript transcription kits according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Ambion). Transcripts used in coimmunoprecipitation assays were synthesized with [32P]UTP and used after separating labeled transcripts from unincorporated nucleotides using Midi Select G25 columns (Eppendorf). For filter binding assays, in vitro transcripts were gel purified and then quantified using RiboGreen (Molecular Probes). 200 pmol were treated with calf alkaline phosphatase and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated [32P]ATP was removed by gel filtration as above. Full-length ORF1p from mouse A-type and TF-type L1 elements were expressed in E. coli as GST-fusion proteins or in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells and then purified from the soluble fraction using non-denaturing conditions, as described elsewhere (14Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 467-475Google Scholar). Protein was incubated with32P-labeled in vitro transcribed RNA (100–350 ng) in 20–50 μl for 40–60 min at 30 °C in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm vanadium ribonucleotides). Some experiments used tRNA (100 ng/μl) carrier, although this reduced the efficiency of coimmunoprecipitation because tRNA competes for the ORF1 protein binding to [32P]RNA (17Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10155-10160Google Scholar). 100 units of T1 nuclease were added to the reaction mixture, and the incubation continued for 45 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold with RIPB (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.3–0.5 mm vanadium ribonucleotide), then ∼4 μg of either ORF1 antibody or preimmune IgG were added, and the incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added, and the incubation continued for an additional 2–3 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The beads were recovered by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% of Nonidet P-40, and twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Finally, immunoprecipitated [32P]RNA was removed from the pelleted beads by incubating in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% SDS, and 25 μg of proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C, extracted with phenol-chloroform, then precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 10 μg of carrier yeast tRNA. Material in this pellet was separated on 7% polyacrylamide (20:1) sequencing gels (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.45-13.58Google Scholar) and analyzed by autoradiography. Increasing amounts of ORF1p were incubated with the indicated amounts of in vitrotranscribed 32P-labeled RNA for 30 min on ice in 80 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). 25 μl of the binding reactions were filtered in triplicate (Invitrogen) through nitrocellulose and DE81 as described (24Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Google Scholar), and then washed with 100 μl of ice-cold binding buffer without dithiothreitol and bovine serum albumin. The 32P retained on nitrocellulose and DE81 was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Binding constants were calculated from graphs of protein concentrationversus fraction bound (nitrocellulose/DE81+nitrocellulose)(y) by fitting the equation y = ([Pf]/K Dapp)/(1+[Pf]/K Dapp) where [Pfree] ≅ [Ptotal] using KaleidaGraph software. Control experiments with each RNA determined that the amounts of32P retained by the nitrocellulose, and the DE81 did not change with 0, 1, 2, or 3 washes. In addition, no RNA was retained by the nitrocellulose when protein was first applied to the filters followed by transcript without allowing binding to occur in solution prior to filtration. Full-length, His-tagged ORF1p from both A-type and TF-type mouse L1 (Fig. 1) was expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells. ORF1p was purified using non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 2) to eliminate the possibility that the nonspecific ORF1p-RNA interaction described previously (17Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10155-10160Google Scholar) was a consequence of misfolding of the protein upon renaturation out of urea. ORF1p was also purified from the soluble fraction of E. coli extracts as described (14Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 467-475Google Scholar). Mouse L1 ORF1p was tested for its ability to immunoisolate specific regions of mouse L1 RNA, as was demonstrated for human L1 ORF1p (16Hohjoh H. Singer M.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6034-6043Google Scholar). Initially, nearly full-length sense-strand L1 RNA (transcript A, Fig. 1) was bound to our original preparation of A-type ORF1p from E. coli(17Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10155-10160Google Scholar, 25Martin S.L. Branciforte D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5383-5392Google Scholar). Following T1 nuclease treatment of the reaction, a 38-nt fragment was selectively coimmunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-mouse ORF1p antibody but not with the preimmune control (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and2). A similar result was obtained using baculovirus-expressed ORF1p (A-type) and transcript B (Fig.3 A, lanes 3 and 4); therefore, all further coimmunoprecipitation experiments used ORF1p purified from baculovirus-infected SF9 cells. Inspection of the nucleotide sequence of transcripts A and B revealed that their largest T1 fragment is 38 nt and that it resides 33 nt downstream of the initiation codon for ORF2. This region of the mouse L1 sequence is orthologous to the larger of the two T1 fragments (41 nt) in human L1 RNA that is coimmunoprecipitated by human L1 ORF1p (16Hohjoh H. Singer M.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6034-6043Google Scholar). To confirm that this is the region of the long L1 transcript that is actually bound to ORF1p and coimmunoprecipitated with ORF1 antibody, transcripts C (Fig.3 B, lanes 1 and 2), D (not shown), and E (Fig. 4 A) were tested with the same protocol. Following T1 digestion and immunoprecipitation, the 38-nt fragment was isolated from all of these transcripts. This 38-nt fragment was also efficiently coimmunoprecipitated when the labeled L1 transcript was first treated with T1 nuclease and then incubated with ORF1p and antibody (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and4), indicating that the 38-nt region contained all of the sequence or structure needed for ORF1p binding. This prediction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of a 43-nt transcript that contained the 38-nt region from mouse L1 downstream of a minimal T7 promoter (Fig. 4 B). From the results of these coimmunoprecipitation experiments, it appears that the 38-nt T1 fragment from mouse L1 RNA is sufficient to bind ORF1p. However, in addition to isolating the 38- and 43-nt transcripts in Fig.4, we noticed that any larger transcripts present in the RNA population were also coimmunoprecipitated, whereas smaller transcripts were reduced or eliminated, especially those shorter than ∼30 nt. Because the 38-nt sequence is likely to have been included in all of the precipitated RNAs, these data do not address whether the sequences present in the 38-nt T1 fragment are necessary for interaction between RNA and ORF1p.Figure 4Efficient coimmunoprecipation of RNAs that are at least 38 nt.

Ab, antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether the 38-nt region is required for the interaction between ORF1p and RNA that allows coimmunoprecipitation, a 160-nt fragment encompassing this region from mouse L1 was transcribed to generate the sense and the antisense transcripts F and G, respectively. Both of these transcripts are efficiently coimmunoprecipitated (Fig.5 A). Similar results were obtained using the short transcripts with the 38-nt region, MS and MC (Fig. 5 B). Because neither the antisense nor the complementary transcripts of the 38-nt region contain the same sequence as the sense strand, and both were coimmunoprecipitated after binding to ORF1p, the specific sequence present in the sense strand must not be necessary for ORF1p to form a stable interaction with RNA. The availability of highly purified ORF1p makes it possible to quantitatively assess its interactions with RNA. For the remaining studies of the interactions between ORF1p and RNA, we employed a sensitive nitrocellulose filter binding assay (24Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Google Scholar). Initial assays that measured binding to transcript F revealed no significant differences between A-type and TF-type ORF1p made in either baculovirus or E. coli (data not shown). Therefore, the remainder of these experiments were done using the TF-type ORF1p from the spastic allele of mouse L1 that was expressed and purified from baculovirus, because spa is known to be retrotransposition competent (26Kingsmore S.F. Giros B. Suh D. Bieniarz M. Caron M.G. Seldin M.F. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 136-142Google Scholar, 27Mullhard C. Fischer M. Gass P. Simon-Chazottes D. Guenet J.-L. Becker C.-M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1003-1015Google Scholar). The binding affinity of ORF1p to RNA was unaffected by EDTA concentrations between 0 and 50 mm (data not shown), indicating that magnesium is not required. The nucleic acid binding domain of ORF1p is highly basic (17Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10155-10160Google Scholar, 19Martin S.L. Li J. Weisz J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 11-20Google Scholar), which suggests a role for electrostatic interactions in the binding of ORF1p to RNA. The effect of ionic strength on the affinity of ORF1p for the 110- and 40-nt sense RNA transcripts was determined by varying the concentration of NaCl in the binding reactions. As expected, the apparent affinity of ORF1p for RNA declined as the concentration of NaCl increased. This effect was relatively small at NaCl concentrations below 350 mm but increased significantly at concentrations above 350 mm (Fig. 6). Because neither slope in Fig. 6 extrapolates to zero affinity at 1m NaCl, the binding of ORF1p to RNA must involve both electrostatic interactions and other types of molecular contacts (28Record M.T.J. Anderson C.F. Lohman T.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 103-178Google Scholar). The sequence requirements for the interaction between RNA and ORF1p were further examined using the nitrocellulose filter binding assay. In 100 mm NaCl with 100 pm RNA, the apparent binding affinity (K Dapp) of ORF1p for the 110/111-nt and 76/77-nt sense/antisense pairs of RNA varied between 1.3 and 3.6 nm (Table I). This result demonstrates that ORF1p binds RNA with high affinity in a sequence-independent manner. However, because the apparent affinity is so high relative to the concentration of RNA, it is possible that a higher affinity binding site could be masked in these conditions. To address this concern, binding studies were repeated with the 110/111-nt and 76/77-nt sense/antisense pairs, lowering the concentration of RNA to 10 pm and increasing the concentration of NaCl. Using 10 pm RNA and 250 mm NaCl, theK Dapp varied between 0.7 and 4.6 nmfor all four transcripts tested. In these conditions, the apparent affinities for the sense transcripts were 3–7-fold higher than those for the antisense transcripts (Table II). Finally, the 40-nt transcripts were tested using 10 and 40 pm RNA in 410 mm NaCl. As expected from the results of Fig. 6, the affinity of ORF1p for RNA is significantly reduced in this concentration of NaCl. Again little difference was observed between the affinities for sense versusantisense transcript (∼2-fold), and no differences were measured between 10 and 40 pm RNA (Fig.7). Taken together, these results demonstrate high-affinity, non-sequence-specific binding of L1 ORF1p to RNA.Table IKDapp (m) for L1 ORF1p binding to 100 pm RNA in 100 mm NaClLengthSenseAntisense110/1111.3 ± 0.1 × 10−93.6 ± 0.2 × 10−976/773.3 ± 0.4 × 10−92.5 ± 0.3 × 10−9 Open table in a new tab Table IIKDapp (m) for L1 ORF1p binding to 10 pm RNA in 250 mm NaClLengthSenseAntisense110/1116.6 ± 0.4 × 10−104.6 ± 0.6 × 10−976/771.2 ± 0.2 × 10−93.2 ± 0.4 × 10−9 Open table in a new tab In this study, coimmunoprecipitation and nitrocellulose filter binding assays were used to examine the interactions of mouse L1 ORF1p with several in vitro transcribed RNAs. ORF1 proteins from two subtypes of mouse L1 were purified using non-denaturing conditions after expression in baculovirus-infected insect cells. Results obtained from both coimmunoprecipitation and nitrocellulose filter binding assays indicate there are no significant differences between the binding interactions of A-type and TF-type mouse ORF1p with RNA. This is not wholly unexpected, given that the ORF1ps encoded by the A and TF elements used here are 87% identical and 92% similar. A much larger number of A-type than TF-type elements are, however, inactive for transposition (5DeBerardinis R.J. Goodier J.L. Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 288-290Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the relative inactivity of A-type elements is not caused by loss of the RNA-binding activity of ORF1p. The sequence of mouse L1 ORF1p lacks any immediately obvious previously identified RNA binding motifs that could elucidate its mode of interaction with RNA. Binding of ORF1p to RNA is unaffected by the presence of EDTA and thus must not require divalent cations. Electrostatic interaction is likely to play a significant role in the interaction between ORF1p and RNA based upon the highly basic nature of the protein. Our experiments have examined the sensitivity of the RNA-protein interaction to increasing concentrations of monovalent cation, and the results demonstrate that binding is dramatically reduced in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl. Consistent with this observation, 500 mm NaCl was used to disrupt L1RNPs from human teratocarcinoma cell extracts in order to isolate the ORF1p (p40) (15,16). We also added 500 mm NaCl to the baculovirus extracts and during binding to the nickel-agarose beads to remove the RNA that would otherwise copurify with the protein (19Martin S.L. Li J. Weisz J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 11-20Google Scholar). The molecular event(s) responsible for the different slopes of the lines that represent the relationship between binding affinity and salt concentration (Fig. 6) above and below 350 mm NaCl is unknown. High salt concentrations may affect the binding of ORF1p to RNA directly or indirectly, e.g. by changing the conformation of the protein and/or the RNA. The results of this study further demonstrate that mouse ORF1p binds RNA with low nanomolar affinity and little regard for nucleotide sequence in physiological concentrations of monovalent cation. Although reproducible differences were observed between theK Dapps for sense/antisense pairs, these differences are within the range (<10-fold) typical of non-sequence-specific nucleic acid binding proteins (29McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Google Scholar). The results obtained in this study are consistent with our previous findings, which demonstrated sequence-independent binding, not only to RNA but also to single-stranded DNA (17Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10155-10160Google Scholar). The apparent affinity of ORF1p for RNA is significantly greater in these experiments, however, as compared with the earlier experiments (17Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10155-10160Google Scholar). This may be because a much greater proportion of ORF1p is active following isolation under native conditions from baculovirus-infected insect cells than it was after purification using denaturing conditions from E. coliinclusion bodies. Further support that ORF1p binds non-sequence specifically to RNA with high affinity comes from the observation that ORF1p was bound to RNA after purification from E. coli using non-denaturing conditions in 150 mm NaCl. This is true not only for full-length ORF1p but also for the C-terminal, nucleic acid binding domain expressed separately (19Martin S.L. Li J. Weisz J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 11-20Google Scholar). Neither of these constructs contained the 38-nt region of L1 that coimmunoprecipitates with ORF1p. Finally, non-sequence-specific single-strand binding is consistent with the nucleic acid chaperone activity of L1 ORF1p (14Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 467-475Google Scholar). Hohjoh and Singer (16Hohjoh H. Singer M.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6034-6043Google Scholar) observed stable interactions of human ORF1p with two T1 nuclease fragments contained within human L1 RNA. Binding to other RNAs or DNA was not detected using a coimmunoprecipitation assay. In this study of mouse L1 ORF1p, we observed that a single T1 nuclease fragment interacted with ORF1p by coimmunoprecipitation. Similar to the results obtained with human L1, this region of the mouse L1 transcript was found to be sufficient for binding to ORF1p. In contrast to the findings with human L1, however, this region was not necessary for stable interaction between mouse ORF1p and RNA, because transcripts lacking this sequence also coimmunoprecipitated with ORF1p and were bound in the filter binding assay. The differences in results obtained between human and mouse L1 may be due to either bona fidespecies-specific differences or to unknown experimental differences. The C-terminal sequences of ORF1p from mouse and human L1 are homologous. Sequence similarity breaks down toward their N termini, however, such that the N-terminal one-third or so of these two proteins is probably not related by descent (17Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10155-10160Google Scholar, 19Martin S.L. Li J. Weisz J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 11-20Google Scholar, 30Demers G.W. Matunis M.J. Hardison R.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 3-19Google Scholar). Nevertheless, autonomous retrotransposition of marked elements absolutely requires ORF1p for both mouse and human L1 (5DeBerardinis R.J. Goodier J.L. Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 288-290Google Scholar, 10Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Boeke J.D. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Cell. 1996; 87: 917-927Google Scholar). Thus, it seems highly unlikely that human ORF1p binding to RNA is only sequence-specific, whereas mouse ORF1p binding is only non-sequence-specific. Another explanation of our results is that the specific binding of ORF1p to a region of L1 RNA requires an accessory cofactor that is present in the human cell extract and co-purifies with ORF1p, perhaps because it is bound to it. Such a cofactor would not be expected to be present in the mouse ORF1p that was purified following expression in bacteria or baculovirus-infected insect cells. This explanation is particularly intriguing because there is persuasive evidence for positive selection acting upon the sequences that form the protein-protein interaction domain of ORF1p; there could be selective pressure operating on ORF1p to evade or attract additional proteins that modulate retrotransposition activity (31Boissinot S. Furano A.V. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 2186-2194Google Scholar). Given the location of the 41-nt high affinity site in human L1, which is also conserved in mouse L1 and lies just downstream of the translational initiation codon of ORF2, it is tempting to speculate that regulated binding to this site could affect the translation of ORF2 and hence retrotransposition. Finally, it remains possible that the small but significant differences in the binding affinity of ORF1p for RNA that we do measure may place any given RNA above or below a threshold for coimmunoprecipitation. Such a threshold could differ either directly because of ORF1p or its antibody or indirectly, e.g. if the binding of ORF1p to RNA is modulated by an event like phosphorylation. Modification of ORF1p may have occurred in the complex protein mixture containing human ORF1p that was used for the experiments of Hohjoh and Singer (16Hohjoh H. Singer M.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6034-6043Google Scholar) but not in the relatively highly purified preparations of ORF1p from the heterologous expression systems used here. Additional studies will be required to distinguish among these possibilities, but data indicate that mutations of the 41-nt sequence in human L1 that preserve the open reading frame remain retrotransposition competent in the autonomous retrotransposition assay. 2S.-L. Ooi, G. Cost, and J. D. Boeke, personal communication. This implies that if there is a modulated high-affinity interaction between ORF1 and RNA at the site near the initiation codon of ORF2, it involves a negative regulator that is not present in the cell types used for the autonomous retrotransposition assay. The results of these coimmunoprecipitation and nitrocellulose filter binding assays, taken together with earlier results (17Kolosha V.O. Martin S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10155-10160Google Scholar, 19Martin S.L. Li J. Weisz J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 11-20Google Scholar), firmly establish that ORF1p from mouse L1 is a high affinity, non-sequence-specific RNA binding protein. This feature is likely to be essential for L1 retrotransposition not only in producing the cytoplasmic RNP but also in facilitating the dynamic molecular interactions that are an essential component of the TPRT reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2048558269,"Translation initiation factor eIF5B/IF2 is a GTPase that promotes ribosomal subunit joining. We show that eIF5B mutations in Switch I, an element conserved in all GTP binding domains, impair GTP hydrolysis and general translation but not eIF5B subunit joining function. Intragenic suppressors of the Switch I mutation restore general translation, but not eIF5B GTPase activity. These suppressor mutations reduce the ribosome affinity of eIF5B and increase AUG skipping/leaky scanning. The uncoupling of translation and eIF5B GTPase activity suggests a regulatory rather than mechanical function for eIF5B GTP hydrolysis in translation initiation. The translational defect suggests eIF5B stabilizes Met-tRNAiMet binding and that GTP hydrolysis by eIF5B is a checkpoint monitoring 80S ribosome assembly in the final step of translation initiation."

The ADAM12 cysteine-rich domain (rADAM12-cys) supports cell attachment using syndecan-4 as a primary cell surface receptor that subsequently triggers β1integrin-dependent cell spreading, stress fiber assembly, and focal adhesion formation. This process contrasts with cell adhesion on fibronectin, which is integrin-initiated but syndecan-4-dependent. In the present study, we investigated ADAM12/syndecan-4 signaling leading to cell spreading and stress fiber formation. We demonstrate that syndecan-4, when present in significant amounts, promotes β1 integrin-dependent cell spreading and stress fiber formation in response to rADAM12-cys. A mutant form of syndecan-4 deficient in protein kinase C (PKC)α activation or a different member of the syndecan family, syndecan-2, was unable to promote cell spreading. GF109203X and Gö6976, inhibitors of PKC, completely inhibited ADAM12/syndecan-4-induced cell spreading. Expression of syndecan-4, but not syn4ΔI, resulted in the accumulation of activated β1 integrins at the cell periphery in Chinese hamster ovary β1 cells as revealed by 12G10 staining. Further, expression of myristoylated, constitutively active PKCα resulted in β1 integrin-dependent cell spreading, but additional activation of RhoA was required to induce stress fiber formation. In summary, these data provide novel insights into syndecan-4 signaling. Syndecan-4 can promote cell spreading in a β1 integrin-dependent fashion through PKCα and RhoA, and PKCα and RhoA likely function in separate pathways.

The extracellular environment profoundly influences cell shape. Following an initial cell attachment event, cells may or may not spread depending on cell type and the nature of the molecular signal they receive. Cell spreading is a fundamental cellular process required for cell migration, survival, proliferation, and differentiation (1Berrier A.L. Mastrangelo A.M. Downward J. Ginsberg M. LaFlamme S.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1549-1560Google Scholar). Cell spreading on the extracellular matrix requires reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of integrins (2Small J.V. Rottner K. Kaverina I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 54-60Google Scholar), resulting in stable adhesion through formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. Several signaling proteins, including PKC, 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CHO, chinese hamster ovary cells; CNF1, cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1; rADAM12-cys, recombinant ADAM12 cysteine-rich domain 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CHO, chinese hamster ovary cells; CNF1, cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1; rADAM12-cys, recombinant ADAM12 cysteine-rich domain phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and R-Ras, have been shown to regulate cell spreading in different cell types (3Disatnik M.H.

Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Google Scholar). ADAMs (adisintegrin andmetalloprotease) constitute a recently characterized family of metalloproteases that also mediates cell adhesion. The prototype ADAM is a multidomain protein composed of pro-, metalloprotease, disintegrin-like, cysteine-rich, epidermal growth factor-like repeat, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic tail domains (7Black R.A. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 654-659Google Scholar, 8Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Google Scholar, 9Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 83-87Google Scholar). The disintegrin domain of several different ADAMs including ADAM 2, 9, 12, 15, and 23 has been shown to support cell attachment (10Cal S. Freije J.M. Lopez J.M. Takada Y. Lopez-Otin C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1457-1469Google Scholar, 11Eto K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Sheppard D. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Zhang X.P. Takada Y. J. Biol.

J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 579-587Google Scholar). For example, the disintegrin domain of both ADAM 2 and 9 supports cell adhesion through the α6β1 integrin (13Evans J.P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 628-639Google Scholar, 15Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Stephens P.E. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2319-2328Google Scholar). For ADAM12 both the disintegrin and the cysteine-rich domains provide molecular information for cell attachment. Thus, cell attachment to the recombinant ADAM12 disintegrin domain is mediated primarily through α9β1 integrin in an RGD-independent manner but cell spreading does not occur (11Eto K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Sheppard D. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Zhang X.P. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34922-34930Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich domain of ADAM12 also possesses important cell binding activities (16Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1489-1501Google Scholar, 17Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B. Frohlich C. Loechel F. Zolkiewska A. Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Liu W. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Wewer U.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1143-1156Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that cell attachment of several different cell lines and primary muscle cell cultures to rADAM12-cys (recombinant ADAM12 cysteine-rich domain) is mediated through syndecans, specifically syndecan-4. Notably, mesenchymal cells attach, spread, and form stress fibers and focal adhesions upon attaching to rADAM12-cys (17Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B. Frohlich C. Loechel F. Zolkiewska A. Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Liu W. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Wewer U.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1143-1156Google Scholar). Carcinoma cells also attach through syndecans, but only form cellular actin-containing projections rather than being spread fully. Cell spreading is only obtained upon further integrin activation by the addition of either Mn2+ or activating monoclonal antibodies (16Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1489-1501Google Scholar, 17Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B. Frohlich C. Loechel F. Zolkiewska A. Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Liu W. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Wewer U.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1143-1156Google Scholar). The importance of the cysteine-rich domain in cellular interactions in vivo was recently underscored by the studies of Gaultier et al. (18Gaultier A. Cousin H. Darribere T. Alfandari D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23336-23344Google Scholar), which demonstrated the importance of the interaction of ADAM13 disintegrin-cysteine rich domains with extracellular matrix proteins like fibronectin. The molecular mechanisms of the downstream events following binding of ADAMs and syndecan-4, however, are completely unknown. Syndecan-4 is a member of a family of four (syndecans 1–4) transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (19Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Google Scholar, 20Horowitz A. Tkachenko E. Simons M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 715-725Google Scholar, 21Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 995-998Google Scholar, 22Simons M. Horowitz A. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 855-862Google Scholar). The core protein of syndecans is characterized by divergent extracellular domains and highly conserved cytoplasmic tails that contain two constant regions (C1 and C2) separated by a variable region (V) unique to each family member (23Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3415-3420Google Scholar). Specifically, the V-region of syndecan-4 contains a unique seven-residue binding site for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) involved in PKCα activation (23Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3415-3420Google Scholar, 24Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Google Scholar, 25Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3415-3420Google Scholar, 26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Google Scholar), which is critical for cell spreading and cytoskeletal reorganization (27Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 is a widespread component of focal adhesions and appears to be a co-receptor in cell adhesion to many extracellular matrix ligands, modifying the integrin-mediated responses (23Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3415-3420Google Scholar, 28Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Google Scholar, 29Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Syndecan-4 levels were shown to be up-regulated in fibroblasts and endothelial cells during wound repair (30Gallo R. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 676-683Google Scholar). Delayed wound repair and impaired angiogenesis were demonstrated in syndecan-4-deficient mice (31Echtermeyer F. Streit M. Wilcox-Adelman S. Saoncella S. Denhez F. Detmar M. Goetinck P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: R9-R14Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 was up-regulated in proliferative renal disease (32Yung S. Woods A. Chan T.M. Davies M. Williams J.D. Couchman J.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1631-1633Google Scholar) and mice deficient in syndecan-4 were more susceptible to κ-carrageenan induced renal damage (33Ishiguro K. Kadomatsu K. Kojima T. Muramatsu H. Matsuo S. Kusugami K. Saito H. Muramatsu T. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 509-516Google Scholar) indicating that syndecan-4 plays an important role in renal diseases. Most of these studies suggest that syndecan-4 plays a role in cell adhesion to extracellular matrix substrates and in the regulation of cell migration, but the mechanism of syndecan-4 signaling during cell adhesion, spreading, and migration is not clearly understood. In the present study, we determined how cell spreading is regulated by ADAM12/syndecan-4 signaling. Our data indicate a critical role for syndecan-4 as a primary receptor for rADAM12-cys and demonstrate that ADAM12/syndecan- 4 regulates cell spreading in a β1 integrin-dependent manner through PKCα and RhoA, which function in separate pathways. The cell lines used in this study were: CHO-K1 (CCL-61 ATCC), CHO-pgsD677 (CRL-2244 ATCC), and CHO cells stably transfected with full-length rat syndecan-4 (S4) (27Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A.

Secondary antibodies conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were purchased from DAKO A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). TRITC-phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Human fibronectin was purchased from Invitrogen, and recombinant human rADAM12-cys was produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described (16Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B.J. Loechel F.

For the transfection of MG-63 cells, FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Hvidovre, Denmark) was used. The cell attachment assay was performed as described previously (16Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1489-1501Google Scholar, 17Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B. Frohlich C. Loechel F. Zolkiewska A. Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Liu W. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Wewer U.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1143-1156Google Scholar). Briefly, Nunc-ImmunoTM 96-well plates with MaxiSorpTMsurface (Nunc A/S) or bacterial culture dishes (35 × 10 mm; Corning Incorporate Ltd., Corning, NY) were coated with 20 μg/ml of rADAM12-cys or fibronectin (10 μg/ml) in 0.1 mNaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.5, overnight at 4 °C. In some experiments, Mn2+ (1 mm), heparin (10 μg/ml), or suramin (10 μm) was added, or cells were pretreated for 15 min with PKC inhibitors: 10 μm GF109203X or 2 μm Gö6976 (Calbiochem-Novobiochem GmbH, Bad Soden/TS, Germany), with 300 ng/ml of CNF1 toxin for 16 h or a mixture of 7 μg/ml of C3 exoenzyme (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) and 5 μg/ml of LipofectAMINE for 12 h at 37 °C in culture medium. Each assay point was derived from 3–6 separate wells and repeated at least three times. Adherent cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed and incubated with TRITC-phalloidin for 30 min for F-actin staining, and washed and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO). For detection of focal adhesions, cells were incubated with mAbs for vinculin or paxillin for 1 h, followed by rinsing and incubation with secondary antibodies. Activated β1 integrin was detected by using the monoclonal antibodies 12G10. To detect activated and total β1 integrins, respectively, MG-63 cells were incubated with β1 integrin antibodies (12G10 and M-106, respectively) and double-stained by incubating with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse and rhodamine-conjugated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Cells were examined using an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert) equipped with phase contrast optics and connected to a PentaMAX chilled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments). Images were processed using Metamorph Software Program. Spread cell areas were measured electronically using the Metamorph program. The images shown were representive from at least three separate experiments. We have shown that RKO colon carcinoma cells attach to rADAM12-cys via syndecan(s) as the primary cell surface receptor, whereas additional activation of β1 integrin with Mn2+ or the activating mAb 12G10 is required for cell spreading to occur (16Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1489-1501Google Scholar, 17Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B. Frohlich C. Loechel F. Zolkiewska A. Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Liu W. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Wewer U.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1143-1156Google Scholar). In contrast, mesenchymal cells, such as MG-63 osteosarcoma cells, attach, spread, and form stress fibers and focal adhesions spontaneously on rADAM12-cys. These results suggest that depending on cell type, rADAM12-cys can activate cross-talk between syndecan(s) and β1 integrin, resulting in cell spreading. In the present study, we have characterized the downstream signaling pathway activated in rADAM12-cys mediated cell attachment and spreading. In addition to human MG-63 osteosarcoma cells and human RKO colon carcinoma cells (17Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B. Frohlich C. Loechel F. Zolkiewska A. Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Liu W. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Wewer U.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1143-1156Google Scholar), we also analyzed hamster CHO-K1 ovarian epithelial cells. CHO-K1 cells express endogenous syndecans 1, 2, and 4 as well as β1 integrins (27Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Google Scholar, 40Echtermeyer F. Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Ge Y. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3433-3441Google Scholar, 41Klass C.M. Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 493-506Google Scholar) and have been extensively used to define the molecular mechanisms of cell attachment and spreading on fibronectin (27Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Google Scholar). When CHO-K1 cells are plated on fibronectin they attach and spread (Fig. 1, A, E, andF). However, when plated on rADAM12-cys they attach but remain round (Fig. 1, B and F). Overall, less than 2% of cells spread following attachment to rADAM12-cys, while close to 100% spread when plated on fibronectin. Heparin and suramin, which interfere with the function of cell surface heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains completely inhibited cell attachment to rADAM12-cys, but did not inhibit cell attachment or spreading on fibronectin (Fig. 1 E). CHO-K1 pgsD-677 cells, which are deficient in the synthesis of GAG chains, did not attach to rADAM12-cys in a cell attachment assay (Fig. 1 C). Together, results shown in Fig. 1, B and C indicate that, similar to carcinoma cells (16Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1489-1501Google Scholar, 17Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B. Frohlich C. Loechel F. Zolkiewska A. Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Liu W. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Wewer U.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1143-1156Google Scholar), the attachment of CHO-K1 cells to rADAM12-cys is through the GAGs of syndecans. Spreading of CHO-K1 cells on ADAM12 could be induced by addition of Mn2+ (Fig.1 D) but spreading was not as extensive as that seen when cells attached and spread on fibronectin (Fig. 1, D andF). Well-developed stress fibers and focal adhesions were observed in CHO-K1 cells attaching on fibronectin as revealed by phalloidin and vinculin staining, respectively (not shown); however, when cells attached and spread on rADAM12-cys in the presence of Mn2+, stress fibers developed but focal adhesions were not apparent (not shown). These results indicate that CHO cells, like several carcinoma cell lines including RKO colon carcinoma cells (16Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1489-1501Google Scholar,17Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B. Frohlich C. Loechel F. Zolkiewska A. Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Liu W. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Wewer U.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1143-1156Google Scholar) attach to rADAM12-cys through syndecans as the primary attachment receptor and require activation of β1 integrins for cell spreading to occur. Based on the reports that syndecans are down-regulated in certain carcinoma cells (42Nackaerts K. Verbeken E. Deneffe G. Vanderschueren B. Demedts M. David G. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 335-345Google Scholar, 43Park H. Kim Y. Lim Y. Han I. Oh E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29730-29736Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the level of syndecans in carcinoma cells might be insufficient to allow efficient cross-talk with and activation of β1 integrin upon binding of rADAM12-cys. To test this hypothesis, CHO-K1 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding full-length and mutant forms of syndecans (Fig. 2 A,schematic representation) and 40 h later cells were plated on rADAM12-cys for 4 h. As shown in Fig. 2, Band C, cells transfected with full-length syndecan-4 underwent spreading, whereas non-transfected cells remained round. The syndecan-4-expressing cells were large, flattened, and exhibited a well-spread morphology. F-actin staining of CHO-K1 cells showed stress fiber formation in the spread cells only (Fig. 2 C), and focal adhesions were not formed as revealed by vinculin or paxillin staining (not shown). Transfection of CHO-K1 cells with a mutant form of syndecan-4, syn4ΔE, which lacks the C-terminal FYA sequence shown to bind PDZ domain-containing proteins (44Zimmermann P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S91-S100Google Scholar), also induced cell spreading and stress fiber formation in CHO cells plated on rADAM12-cys (Fig. 2, D and E). By contrast, transfection with a different syndecan-4 mutant, syn4ΔI, which lacks the domain of the V-region required for PKCα binding, did not induce spreading on rADAM12-cys (Fig. 2, F and G). Expression of a different member of the syndecan family, syndecan-2, failed to induce cell spreading on rADAM12-cys (Fig. 2, H and I). Both syn4ΔI- and syndecan-2-expressing cells were round in morphology and exhibited only peripheral F-actin staining (Fig. 2, Gand I). An estimate of cell spreading revealed that around 15% of syn4- and 10% of syn4ΔE-expressing cells were spread, whereas only 2% of the EGFP-, 3% of the syn4ΔI-, and 3% of the syn2-expressing cells were spread (Fig. 2 J). Next, we used CHO cells that are stably expressing full-length wild type syndecan-4 (S4) and a mutant form lacking the PKCα binding site, syn4ΔI (S4ΔI). These cells have been FACS-selected and shown to express high levels of syndecan-4 at the cell surface (27Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Google Scholar). Labeling for syndecan-4 using an ectodomain-specific monoclonal antibody (150.9) revealed distinct dot-like staining at the cell periphery and at the peripheral ruffles in S4 cells (Fig. 2 J, inset) An estimate of spreading assays using these cells revealed that spreading was increased from 15 to 26% in S4 stably transfected cells compared with syn4 transiently transfected cells. In contrast, the spreading of cells stably transfected with S4ΔI was still only around 2% (Fig.2 J). Transfection of RKO colon carcinoma cells with full-length syndecan-4 similarly induced spreading (Fig.3 A), but cells did not form typical stress fibers (not shown).Figure 3Syndecan-4-induced cell spreading requires activation of β1 integrins.RKO colon carcinoma cells were transfected with the syndecan-4-EGFP expression construct (A–D) and plated on rADAM12-cys for 4 h. In C and D, the cells were pretreated with function-blocking β1 integrin antibodies, AIIB2 (10 μg/ml), for 15 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next asked whether overexpression of syndecan-4 promoted activation of β1 integrin following binding to rADAM12-cys. For this experiment, we used a function-blocking antibody to β1integrin (AIIB2). Only RKO colon carcinoma cells were used because this antibody is specific for human β1 integrin. As expected, pretreatment of RKO cells with AIIB2, but not with isotype-matched control antibodies, completely abolished cell attachment to fibronectin (data not shown). Pretreatment of syndecan-4-expressing RKO colon carcinoma cells with AIIB2 completely inhibited cell spreading on rADAM12-cys (Fig. 3, C and D) without affecting cell attachment. These results demonstrate that transfection of full-length syndecan-4 into CHO-K1 and RKO colon carcinoma cells is sufficient to promote cell spreading on rADAM12-cys in a β1integrin-dependent manner. Furthermore, the fact that deletion of the PKCα-activating domain from syndecan-4 abrogates this effect indicates a role for PKCα in this process. To characterize the potential role of PKCα downstream of syndecan-4, we f"

Here, we demonstrate that protein kinase C gamma (PKCgamma) mediates phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-2 in right, but not left, animal cap ectodermal cells. Notably, both phosphorylation states of syndecan-2 are obligatory for normal LR development, with PKCgamma-dependent phosphorylated syndecan-2 in right ectodermal cells and nonphosphorylated syndecan-2 in left cells. The ectodermal cells contact migrating mesodermal cells during early gastrulation, concurrent with the transmission of LR information. This precedes the appearance of monocilia and is one of the earliest steps of LR development. These results demonstrate that PKCgamma regulates the cytoplasmic phosphorylation of syndecan-2 and, consequently, syndecan-2-mediated inside-out signaling to adjacent cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000568937,"Molecular defects in apoptotic pathways are thought to often contribute to the abnormal expansion of malignant cells and their resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, a comprehensive knowledge of the mechanisms controlling induction of apoptosis and subsequent cellular disintegration could result in improved methods for prognosis and treatment of cancer. In this study, we have examined apoptosis-induced alterations in two proteins, nucleolin and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), in U937 leukemia cells. Nucleolin is expressed at high levels in malignant cells, and it is a multifunctional and mobile protein that can shuttle among the nucleolus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane. Here, we report our findings that UV irradiation or camptothecin treatment of U937 cells induced apoptosis and caused a significant change in the levels and localization of nucleolin within the nucleus. Additionally, nucleolin levels were dramatically decreased in extracts containing the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. These alterations could be abrogated by pre-incubation with an inhibitor of PARP-1 (3-aminobenzamide), and our data support a potential role for nucleolin in removing cleaved PARP-1 from dying cells. Furthermore, both nucleolin and cleaved PARP-1 were detected in the culture medium of cells undergoing apoptosis, associated with particles of a size consistent with apoptotic bodies. These results indicate that nucleolin plays an important role in apoptosis, and could be a useful marker for assessing apoptosis or detecting apoptotic bodies.

The failure of malignant cells to undergo cell death in response to chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure (1Schimmer A.D. Hedley D.W. Penn L.Z. Minden M.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 3541-3553Google Scholar), and, in many cases, chemoresistance is associated with aberrant expression of the proteins involved in the activation and regulation of apoptosis (1Schimmer A.D. Hedley D.W. Penn L.Z. Minden M.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 3541-3553Google Scholar, 2Saikumar P. Dong Z. Mikhailov V. Denton M. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J.

Blood. 1997; 90: 244-251Google Scholar). Consequently, several therapeutic strategies based on modulating apoptotic pathways are currently in development (4Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Google Scholar, 5Makin G. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2002; 6: 73-84Google Scholar).Apoptosis is characterized by well defined morphological and biochemical changes, which are generally mediated by a family of cysteine proteases, called caspases. There are at least two well characterized molecular mechanisms leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis, namely receptor-mediated and mitochondrial pathways, which have been described in some detail in recent reviews (1Schimmer A.D. Hedley D.W. Penn L.Z. Minden M.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 3541-3553Google Scholar, 2Saikumar P. Dong Z. Mikhailov V. Denton M. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J. Med. 1999; 107: 489-506Google Scholar). Both pathways lead to activation of caspase-3, which ultimately results in fragmentation of chromosomal DNA and proteolysis of selected nuclear proteins. The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of nucleolin during apoptosis of leukemia cells treated with the chemotherapy agent, camptothecin, or irradiated with UV light, and to examine the relationship between changes in nucleolin and effects on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1).1Human nucleolin is a 707-amino acid protein consisting of an acidic histone-like N terminus, a central domain containing four RNA binding domains, and a C terminus that is rich in arginine and glycine (RGG repeats). This multidomain structure reflects the diverse roles of nucleolin in cell growth, proliferation, and death, which have been recently highlighted in several excellent reviews (6Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Google Scholar, 7Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Google Scholar, 8Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 407-436Google Scholar). Nucleolin has been implicated in many cellular processes, including transcription, packing, and transport of ribosomal RNA, replication and recombination of DNA, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (6Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Google Scholar, 7Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Google Scholar, 8Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Although generally considered a predominantly nucleolar protein, nucleolin appears to be very mobile and can also be present in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm and on the cell surface (9Daniely Y.

In fact, there are several reports describing redistribution of nucleolin within the cell in response to a number of stimuli, including heat shock (9Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. J.

Blood. 2001; 97: 1756-1764Google Scholar).There is considerable interest in studying nucleolin function, not only because it is involved in so many fundamental processes, but also because of the significance of nucleolin expression in malignant cells. Levels of nucleolin are positively correlated with cellular proliferation (26Derenzini M. Sirri V. Trere D. Ochs R.L. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 497-502Google Scholar) and high levels of silver-staining nucleolar proteins (of which nucleolin is the major component) predict a poor prognosis in many types of cancer (27Derenzini M. Micron. 2000; 31: 117-120Google Scholar). We have proposed nucleolin as a novel target for therapeutic intervention, based on our finding that G-rich oligonucleotides that bind to nucleolin protein can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in many cell lines derived from solid tumors (28Bates P.J. Kahlon J.B. Thomas S.D. Trent J.O. Miller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26369-26377Google Scholar, 29Xu X. Hamhouyia F. Thomas S.D. Burke T.J. Girvan A.C. McGregor W.G. Trent J.O. Miller D.M.

Blood. 2000; 96: 1331Google Scholar).The levels and characteristics of PARP-1 protein have also been examined in this study for two reasons. First, PARP-1 cleavage is a characteristic feature of apoptosis and the timing of apoptosis-associated events is often determined relative to the onset of PARP-1 cleavage. Second, it has been reported that nucleolin can form a complex with PARP-1 in B-cells (11Borggrefe T. Wabl M. Akhmedov A.T. Jessberger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17025-17035Google Scholar) and in kidney cells (32Yanagida M. Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K. Furuichi Y. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1390-1404Google Scholar), suggesting that PARP-1 could potentially be involved in the regulation of nucleolin function, or vice versa.PARP-1 catalyzes the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) chains to a number of nuclear proteins in response to DNA damage. It is clear that this short-lived post-translational modification plays an important, although incompletely defined, role in DNA damage response and apoptosis (33D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Google Scholar, 34Smulson M.E. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Boulares A.H. Yakovlev A. Stoica B. Iyer S. Luo R. Haddad B. Wang Z.Q. Pang T. Jung M. Dritschilo A. Rosenthal D.S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2000; 40: 183-215Google Scholar). PARP-1 enzymatic activity is dependent upon binding to DNA strand breaks and is rapidly activated in response to cellular stresses, such as heat shock, gamma radiation, exposure to carcinogens, and treatment with chemotherapy agents. Synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) uses nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD+), and cleavage of PARP-1 during apoptosis is thought to occur to conserve NAD+ and allow production of ATP, which is needed for execution of apoptosis. This cleavage appears to be a universal part of the apoptotic process, and appearance of the 89- and 24-kDa proteolytic fragments of PARP-1 has become one of the classical hallmarks of apoptosis (33D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Google Scholar, 34Smulson M.E. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Boulares A.H. Yakovlev A. Stoica B. Iyer S. Luo R. Haddad B. Wang Z.Q.

Because nucleolin can translocate between different cellular compartments, alterations in nucleolin in both nuclear (containing the nucleoli and nucleoplasm) and S-100 (containing the cytoplasm and plasma membrane) extracts have been evaluated.DISCUSSIONThere are a number of reasons why studying nucleolin function and regulation is of interest. First, nucleolin is a fascinating protein because of its multifunctionality and its ability to translocate within the cell, yet the reasons for its ubiquitous behavior have not been fully elucidated (6Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Google Scholar, 7Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Google Scholar, 8Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 407-436Google Scholar). Second, nucleolin is associated with many of the processes that are dysfunctional in neoplastic cells (proliferation, cell cycle control, apoptosis) and elevated levels of nucleolin expression are generally related to malignancy (26Derenzini M. Sirri V. Trere D. Ochs R.L. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 497-502Google Scholar, 27Derenzini M. Micron. 2000; 31: 117-120Google Scholar). Third, we have identified nucleolin as the probable molecular target of a class of non-antisense G-rich oligonucleotides that inhibit the proliferation of tumor and leukemia cell lines, and therefore have significant promise as novel therapeutic agents (28Bates P.J. Kahlon J.B. Thomas S.D. Trent J.O. Miller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26369-26377Google Scholar, 29Xu X. Hamhouyia F. Thomas S.D. Burke T.J. Girvan A.C. McGregor W.G. Trent J.O. Miller D.M. Bates P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43221-43230Google Scholar, 30Dapic V. Bates P.J. Trent J.O. Rodger A. Thomas S.D. Miller D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3676-3685Google Scholar, 31Castillos F.A. Bates P.J. Thomas S.D. Xu X.H. Trent J.O. Miller D.M. Blood. 2000; 96: 1331Google Scholar).In this report, we have described alterations in the levels and localization of nucleolin protein that occur in leukemia cells induced to undergo apoptosis by UV-irradiation or treatment with the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. We found that induction of apoptosis was accompanied by a rapid reduction in the levels of nuclear nucleolin, followed several hours later by the disappearance of nucleolin from the S-100 fraction containing plasma membrane nucleolin. A distinct redistribution of nucleolin within the nucleus and the appearance of extracellular apoptotic bodies containing nucleolin and PARP-1 were also observed. By examining levels and localization of nucleolin in relation to other apoptosis-induced changes, we have shown that alterations in nucleolin occur very early in the apoptotic process. For example, at 1 h following UV irradiation of cells (for 30 s), nucleosomal fragmentation of DNA is barely detectable on ethidium-stained agarose gels, and only ∼50% of PARP-1 has been cleaved. At the same time point, levels of nuclear nucleolin are clearly reduced, a distinct alteration in the staining pattern of nuclear nucleolin can be observed, and low levels of nucleolin-containing apoptotic bodies can be detected (Figs. 4 and 6, and data not shown). The fact that alterations in nucleolin are such an early event may indicate that this protein plays an active role in the initiation or progression of apoptosis, although further experiments would be required to confirm this.Previously, there have been several studies that have examined the role of nucleolin in cell death. Martelli et al. (47Martelli A.M. Robuffo I. Bortul R. Ochs R.L. Luchetti F. Cocco L. Zweyer M. Bareggi R. Falcieri E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 264-277Google Scholar, 48Bortul R. Zweyer M. Billi A.M. Tabellini G. Ochs R.L. Bareggi R. Cocco L. Martelli A.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 19-31Google Scholar, 49Martelli A.M. Zweyer M. Ochs R.L. Tazzari P.L. Tabellini G. Narducci P. Bortul R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 634-646Google Scholar) have used light and electron microscopy to examine changes in nucleolar proteins in HL60 leukemia cells treated with camptothecin (to induce apoptosis) or ethanol (to induce necrosis). These authors reported a redistribution (associated with fragmentation of nuclei) of nucleolin in apoptotic cells but not necrotic cells, and found that nucleolin was not degraded during apoptosis, in agreement with our data. In contrast to our results and those of Martelli and colleagues, several other reports suggest that nucleolin is proteolyzed in response to apoptosis. Brockstedt et al. (14Brockstedt E. Rickers A. Kostka S. Laubersheimer A. Dorken B. Wittmann-Liebold B. Bommert K. Otto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28057-28064Google Scholar) used two-dimensional electrophoresis to identify nucleolin as a protein that was cleaved in response to anti-IgM antibody-mediated apoptosis in a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line. Morimoto et al. (50Morimoto Y. Kito S. Ohba T. Morimoto H. Okamura H. Haneji T. J. Oral Pathol. Med. 2001; 30: 193-199Google Scholar) described the proteolysis of a 110-kDa silver-stained nucleolar protein (presumed to be nucleolin) to give a 80-kDa fragment when human salivary gland or oral carcinoma cells were treated with okadaic acid. Finally, Pasternack et al. (51Pasternack M.S. Bleier K.J. McInerney T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14703-14708Google Scholar) reported that nucleolin was a substrate (in vitro) for cleavage by granzyme A, an apoptosis-associated protease secreted by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The seemingly contradictory findings regarding apoptosis-induced cleavage of nucleolin could potentially be caused by cell death occurring via different mechanisms. Although the precise apoptotic pathways for each treatment are far from clear, it seems reasonable to expect that DNA damage (such as UV irradiation or camptothecin treatment) could activate a different pathway from anti-IgM, which binds to B-cell surface receptors (14Brockstedt E. Rickers A. Kostka S. Laubersheimer A. Dorken B. Wittmann-Liebold B. Bommert K. Otto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28057-28064Google Scholar), or okadaic acid, which is known to up-regulate Fas receptor (52Morimoto Y. Morimoto H. Okamura H. Nomiyama K. Nakamuta N. Kobayashi S. Kito S. Ohba T. Haneji T. Arch. Oral Biol. 2000; 45: 657-666Google Scholar).The apoptosis-induced changes in nucleolin levels that we have described appear to depend in some way upon PARP-1, inasmuch as an inhibitor of PARP-1 (3-ABA) can repress them. Further studies will be required to determine whether this is related to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nucleolin by PARP-1, or the binding of nucleolin to the 89-kDa fragment of PARP-1 (or perhaps both). In accord with our observations, previous reports have also described redistribution of 89-kDa PARP-1 in response to apoptosis (53Soldani C. Lazze M.C. Bottone M.G. Tognon G. Biggiogera M. Pellicciari C.E. Scovassi A.I. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 269: 193-201Google Scholar, 54Soldani C. Bottone M.G. Pellicciari C. Scovassi A.I. Eur. J.

Indeed, PARP-1 can be localized in the nucleolus under some circumstances (53Soldani C. Lazze M.C. Bottone M.G. Tognon G. Biggiogera M. Pellicciari C.E. Scovassi A.I. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 269: 193-201Google Scholar, 54Soldani C. Bottone M.G. Pellicciari C. Scovassi A.I. Eur. J. Histochem. 2001; 45: 389-392Google Scholar, 55Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Spring H. Muller M.

Cell Res. 1996; 227: 146-153Google Scholar), and there is some evidence to suggest that the nucleolus is central to the process of apoptosis and the earliest site of caspase-mediated proteolysis (57Horky M. Wurzer G. Kotala V. Anton M. Vojtesek B. Vacha J. Wesierska-Gadek J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 663-670Google Scholar, 58Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Google Scholar).Another novel result of our study is the observation that nucleolin appears to be shed from apoptotic cells in the form of small bodies. Kerr et al. (43Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Google Scholar) first described apoptotic bodies in 1972, and since then several others types of apoptosis-associated particles, including nucleolar-derived structures, have been reported (59Biggiogera M. Pellicciari C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 28-34Google Scholar, 60Halicka H.D. Bedner E. Darzynkiewicz Z. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 248-256Google Scholar). Apoptotic bodies are thought to be derived from collapsing nuclei, which are transported to the plasma membrane and released into the extracellular space, where they are normally cleared by phagocytosis (61Eguchi K. Intern. Med. 2001; 40: 275-284Google Scholar). Although apoptotic bodies have not been extensively characterized, they are known to contain several components including DNA or RNA, plasma membrane components, and nuclear matrix proteins (49Martelli A.M. Zweyer M. Ochs R.L. Tazzari P.L. Tabellini G. Narducci P. Bortul R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 634-646Google Scholar, 60Halicka H.D. Bedner E. Darzynkiewicz Z. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 248-256Google Scholar).The presence of nucleolin in apoptotic bodies has a number of clinical implications. In healthy individuals, apoptotic bodies are engulfed by macrophages or neighboring cells, and cleared from the circulation. However, under conditions of excessive apoptosis, apoptotic bodies may be released into the circulation (61Eguchi K. Intern. Med. 2001; 40: 275-284Google Scholar) and could potentially be detected in plasma or serum. This excessive apoptosis can be caused by a number of conditions including inflammation, autoimmune disease, ischemic injury, and cancer. There is evidence that the presence of apoptotic cells or bodies can be an important diagnostic or prognostic marker for several types of cancer (45Sohn J.H. Kim D.H. Choi N.G. Park Y.E. Ro J.Y. Histopathology. 2000; 37: 555-560Google Scholar, 62de Jong J.S. van Diest P.J. Baak J.P. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 368-373Google Scholar, 63Brustmann H. Pathol. Res. Pract. 2002; 198: 85-90Google Scholar, 64Ghosh M. Crocker J. Morris A. J. Clin. Pathol. 2001; 54: 111-115Google Scholar) and detection of circulating apoptotic material (e.g. nucleosomes or nucleic acids) in serum has been proposed as a non-invasive method to detect the presence of malignancy or to evaluate therapeutic response in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation (65Holdenrieder S. Stieber P. Bodenmuller H. Busch M. Von Pawel J. Schalhorn A. Nagel D. Seidel D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 945: 93-102Google Scholar, 66Lichtenstein A.V. Melkonyan H.S. Tomei L.D. Umansky S.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 945: 239-249Google Scholar). Nucleolin may be a particularly useful marker for apoptosis in these applications because tumor-derived apoptotic bodies are expected to be rich in nucleolin. The ability of apoptotic bodies to deliver their contents to the cells that engulf them is also an interesting property, which has been linked to the horizontal transfer of oncogenes (67Bergsmedh A. Szeles A. Henriksson M. Bratt A. Folkman M.J. Spetz A.L. Holmgren L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6407-6411Google Scholar, 68Holmgren L. Szeles A. Rajnavolgyi E. Folkman J. Klein G. Ernberg I. Falk K.I. Blood. 1999; 93: 3956-3963Google Scholar) and exploited as a drug delivery mechanism (69Ma J. Reed K.A. Gallo J.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1382-1387Google Scholar).Our data also have implications for some autoimmune diseases, which are thought to develop, at least in part, because of defects in apoptotic responses (2Saikumar P. Dong Z. Mikhailov V. Denton M. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J. Med. 1999; 107: 489-506Google Scholar, 61Eguchi K. Intern. Med. 2001; 40: 275-284Google Scholar). Autoimmune diseases are characterized by the development of autoreactive T-cells and B-cells against self-antigens, and there is mounting evidence that this response could be triggered by exposure of the immune system to excessive amounts of intracellular materials from apoptotic cells (70Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1317-1330Google Scholar, 71Andrade F. Casciola-Rosen L. Rosen A. Rheum. Dis. Clin. N. Am. 2000; 26: 215Google Scholar, 72Gensler T.J. Hottelet M. Zhang C. Schlossman S. Anderson P. Utz P.J. J. Autoimmun. 2001; 16: 59-69Google Scholar, 73Cocca B.A. Cline A.M. Radic M.Z. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 159-166Google Scholar). The appearance of nucleolin autoantibodies is one of the hallmarks of the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and these are in fact some of the earliest autoantibodies to develop as the disease progresses (74Minota S. Jarjour W.N. Suzuki N. Nojima Y. Roubey R.A. Mimura T. Yamada A. Hosoya T. Takaku F. Winfield J.B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2249-2252Google Scholar, 75Hirata D. Iwamoto M. Yoshio T. Okazaki H. Masuyama J. Mimori A. Minota S. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 97: 50-58Google Scholar). Our observation that apoptotic bodies containing nucleolin are rapidly shed from cells undergoing apoptosis suggests a possible explanation for the early appearance of nucleolin autoantibodies in SLE. Patients with SLE also have a high frequency of PARP-1 autoantibodies (76Lim Y. Lee D.Y. Lee S. Park S.Y. Kim J. Cho B. Lee H. Kim H.Y. Lee E. Song Y.W. Jeoung D.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 119-124Google Scholar).In conclusion, our studies have identified nucleolin as an important component of the apoptotic pathway in leukemia cells. Although we have not yet elucidated its precise role in this complex process, our results indicate that nucleolin may be involved in the processing of a proteolytic fragment of PARP-1. Furthermore, the distinct nuclear redistribution of nucleolin, its disappearance from the plasma membrane, and its presence in apoptotic bodies may be useful markers to detect apoptosis in experimental and whole animal systems. Following treatment with chemotherapy agents or exposure to cellular stress such as heat shock or ionizing radiation, malignant cells can respond by undergoing apoptosis or necrosis, or may be resistant to treatment. The failure of malignant cells to undergo cell death in response to chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure (1Schimmer A.D. Hedley D.W. Penn L.Z. Minden M.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 3541-3553Google Scholar), and, in many cases, chemoresistance is associated with aberrant expression of the proteins involved in the activation and regulation of apoptosis (1Schimmer A.D. Hedley D.W. Penn L.Z. Minden M.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 3541-3553Google Scholar, 2Saikumar P. Dong Z. Mikhailov V. Denton M. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J.

Blood. 1997; 90: 244-251Google Scholar). Consequently, several therapeutic strategies based on modulating apoptotic pathways are currently in development (4Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Google Scholar, 5Makin G. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2002; 6: 73-84Google Scholar). Apoptosis is characterized by well defined morphological and biochemical changes, which are generally mediated by a family of cysteine proteases, called caspases. There are at least two well characterized molecular mechanisms leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis, namely receptor-mediated and mitochondrial pathways, which have been described in some detail in recent reviews (1Schimmer A.D. Hedley D.W. Penn L.Z. Minden M.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 3541-3553Google Scholar, 2Saikumar P. Dong Z. Mikhailov V. Denton M. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J. Med. 1999; 107: 489-506Google Scholar). Both pathways lead to activation of caspase-3, which ultimately results in fragmentation of chromosomal DNA and proteolysis of selected nuclear proteins. The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of nucleolin during apoptosis of leukemia cells treated with the chemotherapy agent, camptothecin, or irradiated with UV light, and to examine the relationship between changes in nucleolin and effects on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1).1 Human nucleolin is a 707-amino acid protein consisting of an acidic histone-like N terminus, a central domain containing four RNA binding domains, and a C terminu"

This SIR2-dependent form of repression (rDNA silencing) also functions to limit rDNA recombination and is involved in life span control. In this report, we demonstrate that rDNA silencing spreads into the centromere-proximal unique sequence located downstream of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription, but fails to enter the upstream telomere-proximal sequences. The spreading of silencing correlates with SIR2-dependent histone H3 and H4 deacetylation and can be extended by SIR2 overexpression. Surprisingly, rDNA silencing required transcription by RNA polymerase I and the direction of spreading was controlled by the direction of Pol I transcription."

Phospholipase A2(PLA2), with hydrolytic enzyme activities at thesn-2 position in glycerophospholipids, plays critical roles in maintaining the phospholipid composition as well as producing bioactive lipid mediators. In this study we examined the contribution of a Ca2+-independent group IVC PLA2 isozyme (cPLA2γ), a paralogue of cytosolic PLA2α (cPLA2α), to phospholipid remodeling. The enzyme was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, as seen using green fluorescence fusion proteins. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis of membrane extracts revealed that overexpression of cPLA2γ increased the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in phosphatidylethanolamine, suggesting that the enzyme modulates the phospholipid composition. We also found that H2O2 and other hydroperoxides induced arachidonic acid release in cPLA2γ-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, possibly through the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway.

The complexity of these phospholipid structures results in their diverse roles in membrane dynamics, protein regulation, signal transduction, and vesicular secretion. The assembly of membranes requires the coordinate synthesis, catabolism, and transport of phospholipids to create the unique properties of a certain cellular membrane.

It has been reported that cPLA2γ is predominantly expressed in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle in humans (19Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Google Scholar, 20Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.L. J. Biol.

However, the fatty acid selectivity is controversial, and its subcellular localization, cellular roles, and regulation of activity have not been documented. In this study we demonstrated that cPLA2γ is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi and is involved in the mobilization of fatty acids in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). During the search for regulators of the enzymatic activity at the cellular level, we found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate the activity of cPLA2γ, possibly through the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway.

To obtain HEK293 cells stably expressing cPLA2γ, the cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/His-cPLA2γ, selected with 600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and maintained in the presence of 300 μg/ml G418. The expression of cPLA2γ was confirmed by immunoblotting. HEK293 cells transfected with the vector alone were also kept in medium with G418 and used as a vector control. CHO cells were seeded on coverslips (10-mm diameter) on glass-bottomed culture dishes (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/coverslip, transiently transfected with 1 μg of the expression vector encoding a GFP-cPLA2γ fusion protein (pEGFP-cPLA2γ) or a control vector, pEGFP-C1, with LipofectAMINE PLUS according to the manufacturer's protocol, and used for experiments 48 h after transfection. For double staining, cells transiently expressing GFP-cPLA2γ were incubated with 1 μm BODIPY Brefeldin A (λex = 558 nm, λem = 568 nm) or 100 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (λex = 579 nm, λem = 599 nm) in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES and 0.1% BSA for 20 min at 37 °C. The fluorescent signal was observed with an AX-80 analytical microscope system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) or a Zeiss LSM510 Laser Scanning Microscope using a Zeiss 100 × 1.3 NA oil immersion lens. About 1 × 107 cells were collected, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl), and then suspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The total phospholipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Google Scholar). The total lipid extract was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen, dissolved in 400 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and used for mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed essentially as described previously (23Taguchi R. Hayakawa J. Takeuchi Y. Ishida M. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 953-966Google Scholar). Lipid extracts from the cells were analyzed using a Quattro II tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with an electrospray ion source. 5 μl of samples (500 pmol/μl) dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) were introduced by means of a flow injector into the ESI chamber at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. The elution solvent was acetonitrile/methanol/water (2:3:1, v/v/v) containing 0.1% ammonium formate (pH 6.4). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive and negative ion scan modes. The nitrogen drying gas flow rate was 10 liters/min, and its temperature was 80 °C. Essentially, the capillary voltage was set at 3.7 kV, and the cone voltage was set at 30 V in both the positive and negative ion scan modes. Cells were seeded onto 12-well culture plates at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well in DMEM. After 24 h of incubation the medium was removed, and the cells were labeled by incubation for 24 h in 1 ml of DMEM containing 0.05 μCi of [14C]AA and 0.2% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA. The cells were then washed three times with DMEM containing 0.2% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA (the control medium) and stimulated with ligands in the same buffer at 37 °C. The radioactivity of the supernatants and cell lysates (in 1% Triton X-100) was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. The amount of radioactivity released into the supernatant was expressed as a percentage of the total incorporated radioactivity. To observe the subcellular localization of cPLA2γ, CHO cells were transiently transfected with a vector coding for cPLA2γ fused to GFP (GFP-cPLA2γ), and the distribution of the chimeric proteins was examined. GFP-cPLA2γ was located in the nuclear envelope and in an extensive reticular pattern that was typical for ER localization (Fig. 1 A). These structures were identified to be ER and Golgi by loading the cells with BODIPY Brefeldin A, which recognizes both ER and Golgi (24Deng Y. Bennink J.R. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. Yewdell J.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 907-915Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). GFP-cPLA2γ did not colocalize with a mitochondrial marker, MitoTracker Red (Fig. 1 B). We also confirmed the absence of cPLA2γ in the lysosome using a lysosomal marker (data not shown). Although we have previously shown different subcellular localization of GFP-cPLA2γ in a preliminary experiment (56Hirabayashi T. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 124-138Google Scholar), the localization turned out to be caused by a peroxisomal targeting signal generated incidentally in the linker region of the chimeric proteins. Western blotting analysis of protein extracts from cPLA2γ-overexpressing HEK293 cells confirmed the assignment of the localization of cPLA2γ to the microsomal fraction (data not shown), in accordance with the results reported previously for cPLA2γ expressed in CHO cells (19Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Google Scholar) and Sf9 (20Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Google Scholar). These results suggest that cPLA2γ is localized predominantly in the ER and Golgi membranes. Although the enzymatic properties of cPLA2γ in vitro have previously been characterized (19Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Google Scholar, 20Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Google Scholar, 21Stewart A. Ghosh M. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29526-29536Google Scholar), its roles at the cellular level have not been clarified. First, we hypothesized that cPLA2γ might change the phospholipid composition in the membrane, because the enzyme is membrane-bound, possesses Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity (19Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Google Scholar, 20Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Google Scholar, 21Stewart A. Ghosh M. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29526-29536Google Scholar), and is localized in the ER (Fig. 1) where phospholipid biosynthesis occurs. To test this possibility and also to determine intracellular substrates for cPLA2γ, we analyzed the molecular species of phospholipids in HEK293 cells stably expressing cPLA2γ or control cells by ESI-MS. Examination of the PE molecular species in the negative-ion mode demonstrated a relative abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) species such as 1-alkyl or alkenyl-2-acyl 16:1–20:4 (m/z 722.6) and diacyl 18:0–20:4 (m/z 766.7) in cPLA2γ-overexpressing HEK293 cells. In contrast, saturated or monounsaturated fatty acid species such as diacyl 16:0–16:1 (m/z 688.6), diacyl 16:0–18:1 (m/z 716.6) and diacyl 18:0–18:0 (m/z 746.7) were unchanged or rather decreased in cPLA2γ-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig.2 A). On the other hand, analysis of the phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species in the positive ion mode demonstrated no major difference between the two cell lines (Fig. 2 B). To search for stimuli which regulate cPLA2γ activity at the cellular level, we examined the effect of various compounds on AA release and found that H2O2 enhanced AA release. As shown in Fig.3 A, 1 mmH2O2 enhanced AA release from cells in a cPLA2γ-dependent manner. Although the effect was also detected in control cells, much higher release was observed in cPLA2γ-overexpressing cells. Addition of glucose and glucose oxidase to the medium also enhanced AA release from cells expressing cPLA2γ (data not shown). These effects were completely inhibited by adding catalase to the reaction medium. Other ROS, such as cumene hydroperoxide, enhanced the H2O2-induced AA release in a cPLA2γ-dependent manner (data not shown). 4-Hydroxy 2-nonenal, a major oxidized product of fatty acids or hydroxy radicals produced by the combination of Fe2+ and H2O2, did not induce AA release (data not shown). The effect of H2O2 on AA release was evident at 5 min and lasted for at least 30 min (data not shown). Under the assay conditions, no significant loss or floating of cells from the plates were seen (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in three independent stable clones. To further address the involvement of cPLA2γ in the H2O2-induced AA release, we tested the effect of MAFP, which inhibits both cPLA2α and Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) and has also been reported to inhibit cPLA2γ (21Stewart A. Ghosh M. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29526-29536Google Scholar). Pretreatment with 100 μm MAFP exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the H2O2-induced AA release from cPLA2γ-overexpressing cells. MAFP also inhibited H2O2-induced AA release from control cells, probably through inhibition of intrinsic cPLA2α or iPLA2. We investigated H2O2-initiated signaling pathways, because we could not detect the activation of cPLA2γ by H2O2 in vitro (data not shown). ROS cause protein phosphorylation through the activation of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and protein kinase C (PKC) in different cell types (25Jin N. Hatton N.D. Harrington M.A. Xia X. Larsen S.H. Rhoades R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 736-746Google Scholar, 26Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Google Scholar, 27Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Google Scholar), including vascular smooth muscle and cultured endothelial cells. We then tested various inhibitors that regulate the tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.4, calphostin C, an inhibitor of PKC, did not have any inhibitory effects on H2O2-induced AA release but rather a slightly up-regulatory effect. On the other hand, herbimycin A, a PTK inhibitor, inhibited H2O2-induced AA release, whereas orthovanadate (Na3VO4), a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, enhanced H2O2-induced AA release. We could not detect any effect induced by addition of Na3VO4 by itself (data not shown). Thus, cPLA2γ enhanced H2O2-induced AA release through a tyrosine phosphorylation pathway. We could not detect the direct tyrosine phosphorylation of cPLA2γ by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (data not shown). The mechanisms involved in this activation process remain to be elucidated. The major findings of the present study are as follows. 1) cPLA2γ is localized in the ER and Golgi, where membrane phospholipids are abundantly produced. 2) expression of cPLA2γ changes the fatty acid composition in PE but not in PC, as determined by ESI-MS. 3) cPLA2γ is involved in H2O2-induced AA release. ESI-MS analysis showing that the expression of cPLA2γ changed the fatty acid composition in PE (Fig. 2) suggests that cPLA2γ has a substrate preference for PE in intact cells. In an in vitro assay using cell lysates derived from HEK293 cells overexpressing cPLA2γ, the enzyme preferred PE over PC or phosphatidylinositol. 2K. Asai, T. Hirabayashi, N. Uozumi, and T. Shimizu, unpublished data. The precise mechanism by which a relative abundance of PUFA at thesn-2 position of PE was produced in cPLA2γ-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2 A) remains uncertain. Saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids at thesn-2 position of PE may be preferentially hydrolyzed by the PLA2 activity of cPLA2γ, and the derived lysoPE may be reacylated with PUFA by other enzymes with acyltransferase activities. Alternatively, cPLA2γ may have transacylase or acyltransferase activity in itself, as in the case of other PLA2s (28Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Louis A.I. Kramer R.M. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 272-280Google Scholar, 29Lio Y.C. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 320-332Google Scholar). Lysophospholipase activity of cPLA2γ (21Stewart A. Ghosh M. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29526-29536Google Scholar) may also contribute to the remodeling of the phospholipids. ER is a major organelle wherein the biosynthesis of various kinds of phospholipids, including PE, occurs (30Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Google Scholar, 31Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Google Scholar, 32Rusinol A.E. Cui Z. Chen M.H. Vance J.E. J.

Due to the fact that PE has a unique property in that it possesses high proportion of AA or docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) at the sn-2 position, the fatty acid composition in PE may be rearranged to the proper proportion in the ER by cPLA2γ. The membranes of the ER and Golgi, especially those of the smooth ER, constantly participate in protein and lipid mass transport by local vesicle formation and fusion. cPLA2γ may be involved in the local vesicle formation and fusion as suggested for other PLA2s (34de Figueiredo P. Drecktrah D. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Strang M. Brown W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8642-8647Google Scholar, 35Choukroun G.J. Marshansky V. Gustafson C.E. McKee M. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Brown D. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 983-993Google Scholar). As we only determined the subcellular localization of cPLA2γ by the overexpression system, we have to await definite localization in native cells until a good quality antibody is available. H2O2-induced AA release by cPLA2γ suggests that ROS regulate the activity of cPLA2γ at the cellular level. To determine whether the activity of cPLA2γ can be regulated at the cellular level, we searched for stimuli that enhanced the AA release and found H2O2 to be a candidate. H2O2 is one of the highly important ROS because of its ability to penetrate cellular membranes; as a precursor of the hydroxy radical, a powerful free radical, it can cause severe oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids, especially by oxidizing polyunsaturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position. Any oxidative modification of membrane phospholipids is a deleterious process, altering membrane fluidity, protein structure and cell signaling (36Imai K. Aimoto T. Shima T. Nakashima T. Sato M. Kimura R. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2000; 23: 415-419Google Scholar, 37Rapoport S.M. Schewe T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 471-495Google Scholar, 38Uchida K. Shiraishi M. Naito Y. Torii Y. Nakamura Y. Osawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2234-2242Google Scholar). The best way for repairing the phospholipids is the selective cleavage of the peroxidized fatty acid residues and their subsequent replacement by native fatty acids. Although several studies have shown that ROS cause AA release from cells through PLA2, such as iPLA2 or cPLA2α (39Birbes H. Gothie E. Pageaux J.F. Lagarde M. Laugier C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Pushpa-Rehka T.R. Sevanian A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 44-54Google Scholar), capabilities in these enzymes for selective cleavage of the peroxidized fatty acid residues have not been addressed to date. So far, the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolases of type II, which cleave preferentially peroxidized or lipoxygenated phospholipids, are proposed to be competent for the repair (47Nigam S. Schewe T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 167-181Google Scholar, 50Stafforini D.M. Rollins E.N. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3857-3865Google Scholar). Taken together, cPLA2γ may release AA in response to oxidative stress and increase the AA level to repair the oxidized fatty acids in phospholipids. Furthermore, considering the major tissue distribution of cPLA2γ in skeletal muscle and heart, it may contribute to the repair of the oxidized phospholipids in these distinct tissues in which oxidative stress on the unique phospholipid compositions were noted (51Waku K. Uda Y. Nakazawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1971; 69: 483-491Google Scholar, 52Okano G. Matsuzaka H. Shimojo T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 619: 167-175Google Scholar). Regarding the mechanism by which H2O2 activates cPLA2γ, at least three possibilities exist: 1) modification of the enzyme itself or associated molecules; 2) changes in the phospholipids environment; and 3) existence of a recognition mechanism for the oxidized product or oxidative state. Several signal transduction pathways in cultured mammalian cells have been activated by the application of H2O2, including PTKs, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, PKC isoforms, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (25Jin N. Hatton N.D. Harrington M.A. Xia X. Larsen S.H. Rhoades R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 736-746Google Scholar, 26Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y.

For example, cPLA2α is reported to be activated by H2O2 through the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 MAP kinase in mesangial cells (46Hayama M. Inoue R. Akiba S. Sato T. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F485-F491Google Scholar). Unlike cPLA2α, where MAP kinase phosphorylation sites exist (53Borsch-Haubold A.G. Bartoli F. Asselin J. Dudler T. Kramer R.M. Apitz-Castro R. Watson S.P. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4449-4458Google Scholar, 54Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1960-1964Google Scholar), cPLA2γ is postulated to possess consensus sequence for PKC and PTK phosphorylation. In this work we showed that cPLA2γ is activated by H2O2through the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway, as demonstrated by the inhibitor assays. In our preliminary experiments we could not detect direct tyrosine phosphorylation of cPLA2γ by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (data not shown). These results suggest that there may be associated molecules that regulate the cPLA2γ activity in response to the oxidative stress. Other possibilities remain to be explored. In conclusion, we have provided several new insights into the properties of human cPLA2γ, including PE preferencein vivo, localization in the ER and Golgi, and involvement of H2O2-induced AA release. Herein we have elucidated the possible roles of cPLA2γ in mammalian cells, i.e. membrane remodeling and oxidative stress-induced AA release. The physiological and pathological functions of the enzyme would be clarified by analyzing cPLA2γ knockout mice. We thank Drs. M. Murakami and I. Kudo at Showa University for invaluable suggestions and Drs. S. Hoshiko, F. Osawa, and Y. Akamatsu at the Pharmaceutical Research Center, Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. for the encouragement they gave us."
https://openalex.org/W4242932535,"Chromosome 14 is one of five acrocentric chromosomes in the human genome. These chromosomes are characterized by a heterochromatic short arm that contains essentially ribosomal RNA genes, and a euchromatic long arm in which most, if not all, of the protein-coding genes are located. The finished sequence of human chromosome 14 comprises 87,410,661 base pairs, representing 100% of its euchromatic portion, in a single continuous segment covering the entire long arm with no gaps. Two loci of crucial importance for the immune system, as well as more than 60 disease genes, have been localized so far on chromosome 14. We identified 1,050 genes and gene fragments, and 393 pseudogenes. On the basis of comparisons with other vertebrate genomes, we estimate that more than 96% of the chromosome 14 genes have been annotated. From an analysis of the CpG island occurrences, we estimate that 70% of these annotated genes are complete at their 5' end."

According to this model, newly synthesized PTS1-containing proteins would be recognized by cytosolic Pex5p. The cargo protein-Pex5p complex would then dock at the peroxisomal membrane, triggering translocation of the cargo protein across the organelle membrane. Somewhere during this process, Pex5p would be released from the membrane back to the cytosol to catalyze further transport cycles (for review, see Refs. 1Sacksteder K.A. Gould S.J. Annu. Rev.

More recently Dammai and Subramani (18Dammai V. Subramani S. Cell. 2001; 105: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) have shown that Pex5p goes through multiple rounds of cycling between the cytosol and the peroxisome. Thus, the two intracellular pools of Pex5p are interchangeable.The fact that Pex5p cycles between the cytosol and the peroxisome has been considered the landmark observation in favor of the cycling receptor model. However, direct evidence showing that the intracellular movement of Pex5p is coupled to the transport of PTS1-containing proteins was never provided. Furthermore, by proposing that these two events are coupled, the model implicitly assumes the existence of regulatory mechanisms enabling cargo-loaded Pex5p molecules to be inserted into the peroxisomal membrane and excluding free Pex5p molecules from the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery; otherwise a futile energy-requiring cycle would be possible. This constraint is difficult to conciliate with recent observations showing that Pex5p molecules lacking any known cargo-binding domain are specifically targeted to the peroxisome in vivo (7Dodt G.

https://openalex.org/W2009729452,"Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains a severe global health problem that has prompted an aggressive search for new antibiotic targets and vaccine strategies for this persistent pathogen. Recently, a wide variety of genetic determinants of Mtb pathogenicity have been identified, including several genes involved in the biogenesis of the complex Mtb cell envelope. Among these are the mycolic acid cyclopropane synthases, a family of proteins that modify the major cell envelope lipids of Mtb with a diversity of cyclopropane rings. Despite substantial sequence identity, these proteins catalyze highly specific cyclopropane modifications, including proximal modification of the α-mycolate (pcaA) and trans-cyclopropane modification (cmaA2). Here we report the mycolic acid modification function of a third cyclopropane synthase,mmaA2, through the creation and analysis of an M. tuberculosis mmaA2 null mutant. Unexpectedly, mmaA2is essential for the distal cyclopropane modification of the α-mycolate, a function previously attributed to cmaA1. α-Mycolates of a cmaA1 null mutant were unaffected, demonstrating that cmaA1 is not required for α-mycolate modification. Although fully cyclopropanated methoxymycolates are produced in the mmaA2 mutant,cis-cyclopropanation is impaired, leading to accumulation of unsaturated methoxymycolate derivatives. This study establishesmmaA2 as a distal cyclopropane synthase of the α-mycolates of M. tuberculosis and the first cyclopropane synthase to modify both α- and oxygenated mycolates. These results expand our knowledge of the biosynthesis of the Mtb cell envelope and will allow further elucidation of the relationship between Mtb pathogenesis and the fine structure of mycolic acids.

Here we report the mycolic acid modification function of a third cyclopropane synthase,mmaA2, through the creation and analysis of an M. tuberculosis mmaA2 null mutant. Unexpectedly, mmaA2is essential for the distal cyclopropane modification of the α-mycolate, a function previously attributed to cmaA1. α-Mycolates of a cmaA1 null mutant were unaffected, demonstrating that cmaA1 is not required for α-mycolate modification. Although fully cyclopropanated methoxymycolates are produced in the mmaA2 mutant,cis-cyclopropanation is impaired, leading to accumulation of unsaturated methoxymycolate derivatives. This study establishesmmaA2 as a distal cyclopropane synthase of the α-mycolates of M. tuberculosis and the first cyclopropane synthase to modify both α- and oxygenated mycolates. These results expand our knowledge of the biosynthesis of the Mtb cell envelope and will allow further elucidation of the relationship between Mtb pathogenesis and the fine structure of mycolic acids. Mycobacterium tuberculosis nuclear magnetic resonance Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb)1 remains one of the world's great public health problems (1Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione R.C. J. Am. Med. Assn. 1999; 282: 677-686Google Scholar). New drugs active against Mtb or vaccines that prevent Mtb disease are urgently needed but will only come from broader and more detailed understanding of the pathogenic strategies of this persistent microbe. Recently, dramatic advances in the understanding of Mtb pathogenesis have come from the creation of defined Mtb mutants that display altered pathogenesis in experimental animals (2Glickman M.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 477-485Google Scholar). A distinct subset of these mutants have established the pathogenic importance of specific chemical structures in the Mtb cell envelope (3Camacho L.R. Ensergueix D. Perez E. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 257-267Google Scholar, 4Cox J.S. Chen B. McNeil M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 79-83Google Scholar, 5Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Google Scholar, 6Dubnau E. Chan J. Raynaud C. Mohan V.P. Laneelle M.A. Yu K. Quemard A. Smith I. Daffe M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 630-637Google Scholar). The cell envelope of Mtb is a complex structure that contains many unique lipids and glycolipids including mycolic acids, lipoarabinomannan, trehalose dimycolate, and phthiocerol dimycocerosate (7Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Google Scholar, 8Daffe M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Google Scholar). Many of these compounds are suspected virulence effectors based on their in vitro activities, but the genetics of their biosynthesis and exact role in pathogenesis has been unclear due to the lack of defined Mtb mutants lacking specific cell envelope structures.Mycolic acids are very long chain α-alkyl, β-hydroxy fatty acids that are unique to mycobacteria and are greater than 80 carbons in Mtb (9Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Google Scholar). These lipids form a thick hydrophobic layer in the cell envelope in their covalently linked form and form the lipid groups in Trehalose Dimycolate, an immunomodulatory glycolipid that is noncovalently associated with the Mtb cell envelope (10Perez R.L. Roman J. Roser S. Little C. Olsen M. Indrigo J. Hunter R.L. Actor J.K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 795-804Google Scholar, 11Oswald I.P. Dozois C.M. Fournout S. Petit J.F. Lemaire G. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1999; 10: 533-540Google Scholar, 12Oswald I.P. Dozois C.M. Petit J.F. Lemaire G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1364-1369Google Scholar). In pathogenic mycobacteria, but not in non-pathogenic species, mycolic acids are modified with cyclopropyl groups at relatively conserved positions in the meromycolate chain (see Fig. 1 for structures). These cyclopropane residues are added to Mtb mycolic acids by a family ofS-adenosylmethioninedependent methyltransferases that exhibit exquisite substrate specificity for their lipid substrates (9Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Google Scholar, 13Schroeder B.G. Barry III, C.E. Bioorg. Chem. 2001; 29: 164-177Google Scholar). One such cyclopropane synthase,pcaA, was recently shown to be crucial to Mtb persistence and virulence in vivo (5Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Google Scholar).Because of its pathogenic importance, we are systematically studying the cyclopropane modification of mycolic acids in Mtb by deleting each putative cyclopropane synthase from M. tuberculosis and studying these mutant strains for alterations in cyclopropane content of mycolic acids and alterations in pathogenesis. This approach has been highly informative in elucidating the biosynthetic role of two members of this gene family. PcaA was shown to synthesize the proximal cyclopropyl group of the α-mycolate molecule (see Fig. 1) (5Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Google Scholar), whereas cmaA2 was shown to be thetrans-cyclopropane synthase of the oxygenated mycolates (14Glickman M.S. Cahill S.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2228-2233Google Scholar). Based on these insights, the structural basis for the substrate specificity of these enzymes is being elucidated (15Huang C.C. Smith C.V. Glickman M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 13106-13114Google Scholar). In this study we report the role of mmaA2 in mycolic acid modification through the characterization of an Mtb mmaA2 null mutant. In contrast to its previously assigned function in methoxymycolate modification (16Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Google Scholar, 17Dubnau E. Marrakchi H. Smith I. Daffe M. Quemard A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1526-1528Google Scholar, 18Dubnau E. Laneelle M.A. Soares S. Benichou A. Vaz T. Prome D. Prome J.C. Daffe M. Quemard A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 313-322Google Scholar), mmaA2 has an unexpected and non-redundant role in α-mycolate modification and a partially redundant role in methoxymycolate modification.DISCUSSIONThe cyclopropane modification of mycolic acids in M. tuberculosis is a unique lipid structure that has been linked to the pathogenesis of this infection. Mtb uses a family ofS-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases to modify the mycolic acids of its cell envelope with a variety of stereochemistries and positions of cyclopropyl groups. Given the pathogenic importance of this lipid modification, we are systematically studying the biochemical and pathogenetic function of this gene family through the creation of Mtb null mutants in each synthase. Through this approach, we have defined the pathogenetic role and biochemical function of pcaA as a proximalcis-cyclopropane synthase α-mycolate molecule essential for Mtb virulence in mice (5Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Google Scholar). In addition, we have definedcmaA2 as the trans-cyclopropane synthase of both the methoxy- and ketomycolates (14Glickman M.S. Cahill S.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2228-2233Google Scholar). This study establishes the biosynthetic specificity of a third mycolic acid cyclopropane synthase,mmaA2.Role of mmaA2 in α-Mycolate ModificationPrevious examinations of mmaA2 from M. tuberculosis and its homologue from Mycobacterium bovis BCG had been by overexpression of the gene in M. smegmatis, a nonpathogenic mycobacteria that does not produce cyclopropanated mycolic acids (16Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Google Scholar, 18Dubnau E. Laneelle M.A. Soares S. Benichou A. Vaz T. Prome D. Prome J.C. Daffe M. Quemard A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 313-322Google Scholar). These studies revealed that mmaA2cyclopropanated both the epoxymycolate and α-mycolate of M. smegmatis at the proximal position. When mmaA2 was expressed along with the other genes in the mma gene cluster, an intact methoxymycolate was produced. Thus, in M. smegmatis, the activity of mmaA2 was nonspecific, similar to the activity of other cyclopropane synthases in this host (22Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Google Scholar, 26George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Google Scholar). As has been shown previously for pcaA and cmaA2, the construction of null mutants in each cyclopropane synthase is a powerful method to deduce the specific biosynthetic function of this gene family. For mmaA2, deletion of the gene from M. tuberculosis revealed an unexpected non-redundant role in the distal cyclopropane modification of the α-mycolate. This function was previously ascribed to cmaA1 (22Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Google Scholar), a cyclopropane synthase that has no discernible role in mycolic acid modification as determined in this study by construction of a cmaA1 null mutant. This surprising role for mmaA2 in distal α-mycolate modification means that mmaA2 is biosynthetically closely linked to pcaA, the proximal cyclopropane synthase of the α-mycolate. Interestingly, the mycolic acid phenotypes of themmaA2 and pcaA mutant differ in ways other than distal versus proximal cyclopropanation. For reasons that are unknown, the pcaA mutant accumulates large amounts of ketomycolates (5Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Google Scholar), a phenotype that is absent from the mmaA2mutant (Fig. 3). Although the protein structure of MmaA2 has not yet been solved, comparison of this structure to PcaA may provide further insight into the exquisite catalytic specificity of this gene family (15Huang C.C. Smith C.V. Glickman M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 13106-13114Google Scholar). Careful examination of the mass spectrum of the mmaA2mutant α-mycolate revealed that the small amount of intact α-mycolate synthesized in the mutant was only one chain length. This 81-carbon intact α-mycolate is the longest major α-mycolate synthesized in wild type cells, and this result may indicate that some unidentified cyclopropane synthase can modify the distal position in the absence of mmaA2, but that this redundancy is limited to longer chain length lipids.Role of mmaA2 in Methoxymycolate ModificationThe role of mmaA2 in methoxymycolate modification is less clear due to probable redundancy with other cyclopropane synthases. ThemmaA2 null mutant accumulates unsaturated derivatives of methoxymycolates but still synthesizes intact methoxymycolates. Characterization of the mmaA2 mutant methoxymycolate by NMR revealed a 2-fold reduction in the relative abundance ofcis-cyclopropanated methoxymycolate. This data is most consistent with a role for mmaA2 as the preferredcis-cyclopropane synthase of the methoxymycolates, as had been suggested by its function in M. smegmatis and its genomic organization alongside other putative methoxymycolate biosynthetic genes. However, the production ofcis-cyclopropanated methoxymycolate in the mmaA2mutant demonstrates that another enzyme can perform this function. The most likely candidate for this redundant function is cmaA2, the trans-cyclopropane synthase of the methoxy- and ketomycolates. Although cis-cyclopropanated methoxymycolates are produced in the cmaA2 mutant (14Glickman M.S. Cahill S.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2228-2233Google Scholar),cmaA2 does have nonspecific cis-cyclopropanating activity in M. smegmatis (26George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Google Scholar), suggesting that it could serve a cis synthase in the absence of mmaA2.The new insights into mmaA2 function presented here expand our knowledge of the biosynthesis of the complex M. tuberculosis cell envelope and the biosynthetic specificity of the mycolic acid cyclopropane synthases. In addition, the mmaA2null mutant provides another defined mutant in cell envelope biosynthesis that can be tested in animal models of pathogenesis. It will be particularly interesting to compare the pathogenesis phenotype of the mmaA2 mutant to the pcaA mutant phenotype as these two mutants differ predominantly in the position of the missing cyclopropyl group in the α-mycolate. Characterization of these mutant strains will provide further insight into the relationship between the fine chemical structure of the Mtb cell envelope and specific pathogenesis phenotypes. This information may help validate the mycolic acids modification system as an attractive drug target for new antituberculosis drugs and may reveal novel mechanisms by which the host immune system recognizes the fine structure of mycobacterial lipids. Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb)1 remains one of the world's great public health problems (1Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione R.C. J. Am. Med.

As has been shown previously for pcaA and cmaA2, the construction of null mutants in each cyclopropane synthase is a powerful method to deduce the specific biosynthetic function of this gene family. For mmaA2, deletion of the gene from M. tuberculosis revealed an unexpected non-redundant role in the distal cyclopropane modification of the α-mycolate. This function was previously ascribed to cmaA1 (22Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Google Scholar), a cyclopropane synthase that has no discernible role in mycolic acid modification as determined in this study by construction of a cmaA1 null mutant. This surprising role for mmaA2 in distal α-mycolate modification means that mmaA2 is biosynthetically closely linked to pcaA, the proximal cyclopropane synthase of the α-mycolate. Interestingly, the mycolic acid phenotypes of themmaA2 and pcaA mutant differ in ways other than distal versus proximal cyclopropanation. For reasons that are unknown, the pcaA mutant accumulates large amounts of ketomycolates (5Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Google Scholar), a phenotype that is absent from the mmaA2mutant (Fig. 3). Although the protein structure of MmaA2 has not yet been solved, comparison of this structure to PcaA may provide further insight into the exquisite catalytic specificity of this gene family (15Huang C.C. Smith C.V. Glickman M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 13106-13114Google Scholar). Careful examination of the mass spectrum of the mmaA2mutant α-mycolate revealed that the small amount of intact α-mycolate synthesized in the mutant was only one chain length. This 81-carbon intact α-mycolate is the longest major α-mycolate synthesized in wild type cells, and this result may indicate that some unidentified cyclopropane synthase can modify the distal position in the absence of mmaA2, but that this redundancy is limited to longer chain length lipids.Role of mmaA2 in Methoxymycolate ModificationThe role of mmaA2 in methoxymycolate modification is less clear due to probable redundancy with other cyclopropane synthases. ThemmaA2 null mutant accumulates unsaturated derivatives of methoxymycolates but still synthesizes intact methoxymycolates. Characterization of the mmaA2 mutant methoxymycolate by NMR revealed a 2-fold reduction in the relative abundance ofcis-cyclopropanated methoxymycolate. This data is most consistent with a role for mmaA2 as the preferredcis-cyclopropane synthase of the methoxymycolates, as had been suggested by its function in M. smegmatis and its genomic organization alongside other putative methoxymycolate biosynthetic genes. However, the production ofcis-cyclopropanated methoxymycolate in the mmaA2mutant demonstrates that another enzyme can perform this function. The most likely candidate for this redundant function is cmaA2, the trans-cyclopropane synthase of the methoxy- and ketomycolates. Although cis-cyclopropanated methoxymycolates are produced in the cmaA2 mutant (14Glickman M.S. Cahill S.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2228-2233Google Scholar),cmaA2 does have nonspecific cis-cyclopropanating activity in M. smegmatis (26George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Google Scholar), suggesting that it could serve a cis synthase in the absence of mmaA2.The new insights into mmaA2 function presented here expand our knowledge of the biosynthesis of the complex M. tuberculosis cell envelope and the biosynthetic specificity of the mycolic acid cyclopropane synthases. In addition, the mmaA2null mutant provides another defined mutant in cell envelope biosynthesis that can be tested in animal models of pathogenesis. It will be particularly interesting to compare the pathogenesis phenotype of the mmaA2 mutant to the pcaA mutant phenotype as these two mutants differ predominantly in the position of the missing cyclopropyl group in the α-mycolate. Characterization of these mutant strains will provide further insight into the relationship between the fine chemical structure of the Mtb cell envelope and specific pathogenesis phenotypes. This information may help validate the mycolic acids modification system as an attractive drug target for new antituberculosis drugs and may reveal novel mechanisms by which the host immune system recognizes the fine structure of mycobacterial lipids. Role of mmaA2 in α-Mycolate ModificationPrevious examinations of mmaA2 from M. tuberculosis and its homologue from Mycobacterium bovis BCG had been by overexpression of the gene in M. smegmatis, a nonpathogenic mycobacteria that does not produce cyclopropanated mycolic acids (16Yuan Y.

https://openalex.org/W2067306873,"We have investigated the role played by GSH efflux in apoptosis of human HaCaT keratinocytes induced by UVA irradiation. UVA irradiation of HaCaT cells caused a rapid rise in GSH efflux across the intact cell membrane, followed by an increase in apoptosis. GSH efflux was stimulated by glucose and was reduced by the addition of exogenous GSH and intracellular GSH depletion by buthionine sulfoximine, suggesting that GSH transport is active and is influenced by the GSH concentration gradient across the cell membrane. Verapamil and cyclosporin A, blockers of the multidrug resistance-associated protein, decreased UVA-induced GSH efflux. GSH efflux occurred within 2 h of UVA irradiation, suggesting that the stimulation of GSH efflux is due to an increase in the activity of pre-existing multidrug resistance-associated protein transporter carrier. Although inhibition of GSH efflux did not affect caspase activation and DNA fragmentation, it delayed the gradual increase in plasma membrane permeability and reduced phosphatidylserine translocation in HaCaT cells. It is therefore likely that upon UVA irradiation, GSH efflux increased the intracellular oxidative stress without intervention of reactive oxygen species, thus resulting in more phosphatidylserine externalization and membrane rearrangement. These provide targets for macrophage recognition and phagocytosis and thus minimize the potential to invoke inflammation or neoplastic transformation.

Kripke M.L. Abseck S. Arnold F. Slaper H.I. Velders G. Takizawa Y. van der Leun J.C. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 1998; 46: 20-39Google Scholar, 2de Gruijl F.R. Eur. J.

UVA has long been considered less of a causative factor in skin carcinogenesis than UVB due to its negligible absorption by DNA. However, the greater abundance of UVA in solar UV irradiation and deeper penetration of UVA into the actively dividing basal layer of the skin increases the relative importance of UVA as compared with UVB (4Robert C. Muel B. Benoit A. Dubertret L. Sarasin A. Stary A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 721-728Google Scholar). UVA has been shown to be a risk factor for melanoma in fish (5Setlow R.B. Grist E. Thompson K. Woodhead A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6666-6670Google Scholar) and could be also in humans (6Wang S.Q. Setlow R. Berwick M. Polsky D. Marghoob A.A. Kopf A.W. Bart R.S.

Fortunately, the carcinogenic effects of UV irradiation may be decreased by apoptosis, programmed cell death, which eliminates DNA-damaged or potentially mutated cells. Much more is known about UVB-induced apoptosis than about apoptosis induced by UVA in both normal keratinocytes and immortalized keratinocytes (9Schwarz A. Bhardwaj R. Aragane Y. Mahnke K. Riemann H.

In support of this involvement, a protective role is played by tea polyphenols against both cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by UVA in rat keratinocytes; this protection correlates well with the ability of the polyphenols to quench reactive oxygen species (23Fu Y.C.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in UVA-induced apoptosis of human keratinocytes are still poorly understood. There is evidence that protection of human skin cells against a wide range of solar UV radiation damage, including UVA, involves endogenous glutathione (24Tyrrell R.M. Pidoux M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 47: 405-412Google Scholar). This thiol is involved in many biological processes, including the regulation of gene expression, apoptosis, and membrane transport (25Lomaestro B.M. Malone M. Ann. Pharmacother. 1995; 29: 1263-1273Google Scholar, 26Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Google Scholar, 27Hammond C.L. Lee T.K. Ballatori N. J. Hepatol. 2001; 34: 946-954Google Scholar). Glutathione is considered to be the most prevalent and most important intracellular non-protein thiol-disulfide redox buffer in mammalian cells (25Lomaestro B.M. Malone M. Ann. Pharmacother. 1995; 29: 1263-1273Google Scholar, 26Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Google Scholar, 27Hammond C.L. Lee T.K. Ballatori N. J. Hepatol. 2001; 34: 946-954Google Scholar). The higher glutathione content in immortalized HaCaT cells is expected to confer resistance to UVA irradiation as compared with normal keratinocytes (28Leccia M.T. Richard M.J. Joanny-Crisci F. Beani J.C. Eur. J. Dermatol. 1998; 8: 478-482Google Scholar). In apoptosis, the role of glutathione is controversial and dependent on cell types and pro-apoptotic stimuli. (i) High intracellular reduced GSH levels have been found to prevent Fas-induced cell apoptosis in the Fas-resistant variant CEM2D1R (29Chiba T. Takahashi S. Sato N. Ishii S. Kikuchi K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1164-1169Google Scholar), whereas decreased GSH levels enhance Fas-induced apoptosis in the Fas-resistant variant CEM2D1R and the human hepatoma cell line HepG (2de Gruijl F.R. Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 2003-2009Google Scholar, 29Chiba T. Takahashi S. Sato N. Ishii S. Kikuchi K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1164-1169Google Scholar, 30Yang C.F. Shen H.M. Ong C.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 142-152Google Scholar). (ii) Low intracellular GSH levels have also been shown to prevent apoptosis by compromising caspase activation in mouse hepatocytes (31Hentze H. Kunstle G. Volbracht C. Ertel W. Wendel A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 177-185Google Scholar, 32Hentze H. Gantner F. Kolb S.A. Wendel A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 2045-2056Google Scholar). Depletion of intracellular GSH prevented CD95-triggered apoptosis upstream of caspase-8 activation in T and B cells (33Hentze H. Schmitz I. Latta M. Krueger A. Krammer P.H. Wendel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5588-5595Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells undergoing apoptosis also appear to export GSH into the extracellular space (34Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Google Scholar, 35van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15420-15427Google Scholar, 36Oda T. Sadakata N. Komatsu N. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 715-721Google Scholar, 37Pullar J.M. Hampton M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19402-19407Google Scholar). However, neither the mechanism involved in the transport of GSH nor the functional benefit of this process is known. In this study we have found that in immortalized HaCaT cells, UVA irradiation induces the active efflux of GSH. We have surveyed the mechanisms involved in this efflux, focusing on the possible roles of MRP1 transporter protein. We also found that GSH export is closely associated with UVA-induced apoptosis. Reduced GSH, GSSG, verapamil (VP), cyclosporin A (CsA), 5-sulfosalicylic acid glutathione reductase, and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) were purchased from Sigma. 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), 2-vinylpyridine, EDTA, glucose, NADPH, and triethanolamine were purchased from Aldrich. The spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (38Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Google Scholar), obtained from Prof. N. Fusenig (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany), was maintained in monolayer culture in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 31 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For experiments, HaCaT keratinocytes were grown in 12-well plates or plastic Petri dishes (100 mm) for 24–48 h. 4 h prior to UVA treatment, subconfluent cells were given fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. For GSH depletion, BSO (50 μm) was added to the culture medium, and the cells were incubated for 18 h prior to UVA exposure (39Griffith O.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 59-63Google Scholar); this treatment had no effect on cell viability. The medium was removed, and cells were washed once with sterile PBS (PBS-CMF, calcium/magnesium-free). After the addition of sterile PBS or PBS containing 10 mm of glucose, the cells were irradiated with fluorescent lamps (Houvalite F20T12BL-HO PUVA, National Biological Corp., Twinsburg, OH) with the dish lid on. The UVA dose was monitored with a Goldilux UV meter equipped with a UVA detector (Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT). Control samples were kept in the dark under the same conditions. After treatment, the supernatant was removed or collected as indicated, and the cells were washed with PBS. For the apoptosis assay, fresh medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum was added after exposure, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. At predetermined time points, attached and floating cells were harvested and subjected to apoptosis analysis. In selected experiments, cells were pretreated with GSH or inhibitors for multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) at 37 °C for 15 min prior to irradiation. GSH and GSSG were measured using a modified method for glutathione determination in microtiter plates (40Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Google Scholar, 41Baker M.A. Cerniglia G.J. Zaman A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 360-365Google Scholar). Briefly, after removal of the supernatant, cells in 12-well plates were washed with PBS and then treated with 500 μl of 10 mmhydrochloric acid and stored at −20 °C until analyzed. Cells were scraped and sonicated three times for 5 s and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots (350 μl) of the supernatant were collected, of which 50 μl were transferred to separate microtubes for BCA protein assay (Pierce). To the remaining aliquot (300 μl), 300 μl of 5% 5-sulfosalicylic acid was added, and the mixture was vortexed and then kept on ice for 5 min to precipitate protein. After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, 500 μl of supernatant were collected, neutralized by the addition of 4 mtriethanolamine solution, and divided into 2 aliquots for measurement of GSSG and total glutathione. To conjugate GSH, 2-vinylpyridine was added to one of the aliquots to a final concentration of 2% (v/v). The microtiter plate was prepared by pipetting 50 μl of standards or samples per well. Immediately, 100 μl of freshly prepared assay mix (0.49 ml of 6 mm DTNB, 3.75 ml of 1 mm NADPH, 8.15 ml of phosphate/EDTA buffer, and 20 units of glutathione reductase) was pipetted into each well. The plate was placed into the microplate reader (Tecan US SPECTRAFluor Plus, Research Triangle Park, NC) and the absorption at 405 nm monitored. The GSH or GSSG levels were expressed as nmol/mg protein or ratio as compared with respective controls without UVA treatment. For extracellular GSH and GSSG, cell supernatants were treated similarly, with or without 2-vinylpyridine followed by microtiter detection using the DTNB/NADPH/glutathione reductase assay mix. The pattern of DNA cleavage was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 20 mmEDTA; 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice at 4 °C overnight. After incubation at 56 °C for 1 h with RNase A (100 μg/ml) and then 1 h with proteinase K (200 μg/ml), the cell lysate was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isopropyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v). DNA was precipitated with ethanol and subsequently washed with 70% ethanol. DNA samples, dissolved in 1× TE buffer, were separated by horizontal electrophoresis on 1.5 or 1.8% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. Caspases were assayed using ApoAlert Caspase Fluorescent Assay Kits (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, cells were extracted in lysis buffer, and the cell lysate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with assay buffer containing one of the following fluorescent caspase substrates: Ac-DEVD-AFC for caspase-3, Ac-IETD-AFC for caspase-8, and Ac-LEHD-AFC for caspase-9. The fluorometric detection of cleaved AFC product was performed on a plate reader (excitation 400 nm and emission 505 nm). For preparation of the AFC calibration curve, 80 μm free AFC was diluted in the caspase assay buffer without substrate to give 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μm of free AFC. The results were expressed as ratio of the treated samples to respective control samples. LDH, a stable cytosolic enzyme that is released upon the increase in plasma membrane permeability, is determined by CytoTox96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, after treatment, 50 μl of medium was taken at different time points to the enzymatic assay plate. After all samples were taken, 50 μl of substrate mix was added to each well of the enzymatic assay plate, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of stop solution, and LDH was determined by recording the absorbance at 492 nm by a plate reader. The maximum LDH release control was done by adding lysis solution to the control cells. The results were expressed as LDH released (%) = (treated − control)/(maximum − control) × 100. Annexin V staining was used to determine the translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) in UVA-induced apoptosis. After incubation, control or treated cells including attached and floating cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with cold PBS and stained with TACSTM annexin V kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells positive for annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate were quantified by flow cytometry using a BD FACSort (BD Biosciences). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of three to six experiments. The Student's t test was used for comparisons between experimental groups (n = 3–6). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In order to determine the effect of UVA on the efflux of GSH, we irradiated subconfluent HaCaT cells in PBS with UVA, with and without glucose. We found that in the presence of glucose to provide energy, UVA (25 J/cm2) induced significant efflux of GSH (Fig.1). The total glutathione level in HaCaT cells in normal culture is 62.6 nmol/mg protein, of which more than 98% is in the reduced form (GSH). As compared with normal cells cultured in medium, intracellular total glutathione, GSH + GSSG, of cells incubated in the dark decreased to 41.9 and 40.6 nmol/mg protein for PBS and glucose PBS solutions, respectively (Fig. 1 A). GSH levels also decreased, whereas levels of the oxidized form, GSSG, increased ∼3-fold. When HaCaT cells were irradiated with UVA at a dose of 25 J/cm2 in the presence of glucose (10 mm), intracellular total glutathione levels and GSH decreased significantly from dark controls, whereas GSSG levels remained unchanged (Fig. 1 A). Thus the decrease in total glutathione appears to be due to a reduction in GSH. To determine whether GSH was exported into the extracellular medium, supernatants were collected, and GSH, GSSG, and total glutathione levels were determined (Fig. 1 B). In the dark, the presence of glucose had no effect on the levels of extracellular GSH, GSSG, or total glutathione. When the sum of the intracellular and extracellular total glutathione was compared with intracellular total glutathione in normal cultured cells, the loss of intracellular total glutathione was recovered completely in the supernatant. Efflux of GSH caused a decrease in intracellular GSH. In the absence of glucose, however, there was no GSH efflux, and the intracellular GSH depletion was due to the oxidation to GSSG (Fig. 1, A and B). When HaCaT cells were irradiated with different doses of UVA (Fig.1 C), GSH efflux increased with the UVA dose. There was no GSH efflux below 10 J/cm2, but GSH efflux increased up to 25 J/cm2 and remained unchanged. Interestingly, consistent with Fig. 1, A and B, no GSH efflux was observed under different doses of UVA irradiation in the absence of glucose. To confirm the requirement of glucose, GSH efflux was determined in the presence of different concentrations of glucose (Fig. 1 D). Under UVA irradiation (25 J/cm2), GSH was exported in a glucose concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that glucose is required for GSH efflux induced by UVA irradiation. To determine whether the efflux of GSH under UVA irradiation is influenced by GSH levels, we used exogenous GSH to increase extracellular GSH levels or BSO, a known GSH-depleting agent, to decrease intracellular GSH. Each agent was added and incubated with cells prior to UVA irradiation. In the dark, exogenous GSH (1 mm) incubated with cells for 15 min at 37 °C did not affect intracellular GSH or GSSG even in the presence of glucose (Fig. 2 A). As observed previously, when cells were irradiated with 25 J/cm2 of UVA in the presence of glucose, GSH was exported into the extracellular medium (see above). However, the addition of exogenous GSH reduced the loss in intracellular GSH and thus the UVA-induced efflux significantly. The GSSG level did not change significantly with or without exogenous GSH (Fig. 2 A). When BSO (50 μm) was added to the cell culture 18 h prior to UVA exposure, intracellular total glutathione decreased dramatically; no cytotoxicity was detected (data not shown). As was the case with non-BSO-pretreated cells, the UVA-induced decrease in total intracellular glutathione in BSO-pretreated cells was recovered from the extracellular medium (Fig. 2 B). Although GSH efflux was induced by UVA irradiation after GSH depletion by BSO incubation, the efflux process slowed down due to the dramatic decrease in intracellular GSH. To identify the possible transport carrier involved in UVA-induced GSH efflux, inhibitors for multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) were preincubated with cells prior to irradiation. In the dark, VP (10 or 20 μm) and CsA (5 or 10 μm) caused no significant change (data not shown). When cells pretreated with verapamil or CsA were irradiated with UVA, UVA in the presence of either inhibitor caused less of a GSH efflux as compared with UVA alone (Fig. 3 A). Higher concentrations of CsA or VP exhibited more inhibition on GSH efflux. These results indicated that verapamil and CsA both inhibited the efflux of GSH, with CsA being somewhat more effective. The much lower inhibition by verapamil could be due to the fact that verapamil inhibits MRP activity non-competitively and may exhibit lower inhibition on the binding of GSH with MRP1, as compared with cyclosporin A, a competitive inhibitor of MRP1-substrate binding. However, after irradiation, UVA did not cause further GSH efflux as compared with the control samples (Fig. 3 B). Neither verapamil nor cyclosporin A affected the GSH efflux. This suggests that UVA-induced GSH efflux occurs during the irradiation but not after irradiation. To evaluate the physiological role of UVA-induced GSH efflux, we examined the influence of GSH efflux inhibition on UVA-induced apoptosis. HaCaT cells were first treated with or without cyclosporin A, verapamil, or GSH and then subjected to UVA irradiation. DNA fragmentation was monitored by electrophoresis; the activities of caspases-3, -8, and -9 were measured with their respective fluorescent substrates; the plasma membrane permeability was determined by LDH release; and the externalization of PS on the cell surface was monitored by flow cytometry in combination with annexin V staining. As shown in Fig. 4, A andB, UVA irradiation caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in DNA fragmentation in HaCaT cells. However, UVA-induced DNA fragmentation was not markedly inhibited by prior treatment of HaCaT cells with cyclosporin A, verapamil, or GSH (Fig. 4 C). UVA irradiation activated caspases-3, -8, and -9 in a time-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). After UVA irradiation (25 J/cm2), caspases-3, -8, and -9 were activated as early as 30 min. However, pretreatment with cyclosporin A, verapamil, or GSH did not affect the activation of these caspases at 1 (Fig. 5 B) or 6 h (Fig. 5 C). Furthermore, the pretreatment of the cells with Ac-DEVD-CHO, the caspase-3 inhibitor, had no effect on UVA-induced GSH efflux (Fig. 5 D). There was no caspase-3 activation (data not shown) while dramatic GSH efflux occurred (Fig. 1) immediately after UVA exposure, suggesting that GSH efflux induced by UVA precedes the caspase-3 activation.Figure 5Inhibition of GSH efflux has no effect on the activation of caspases-3, -8, and -9 by UVA. A, after UVA exposure (25 J/cm2), the cells were incubated for different times. The caspase activity was determined in cytosolic extracts prepared at the time point given. B, in a parallel experiment, the cells were pretreated with CsA (10 μm), VP (20 μm), or GSH (1 mm) and then irradiated with UVA (25 J/cm2). The caspase activity was determined 1 h after UVA treatment. C, the cells were treated the same as in B, and the caspase activity was determined 6 h after UVA irradiation. D, the cells were pretreated with caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO (10 and 20 μm). After UVA irradiation (25 J/cm2), the supernatants were taken, and glutathione levels were determined. Results are the mean ± S.E. of four to six experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) UVA also caused a gradual increase in LDH release in HaCaT cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig.6 A). The presence of cyclosporin A (2.5, 5, or 10 μm) (Fig. 6 B), verapamil (5, 10, or 20 μm) (Fig. 6 C), or GSH (0.2 or 1 mm) (Fig. 6 D) inhibited the LDH release. It is evident that GSH is more efficient in inhibiting UVA-caused LDH release than CsA or VP. These results suggest that GSH efflux induced by UVA is involved in the increased in plasma membrane permeability. Cell lysis especially occurs in the late stage of apoptosis when macrophages are absent. In order to test whether GSH efflux is involved in the translocation of PS, a membrane lipid rearrangement occurring in the early or intermediate stage of apoptosis and the triggering event in the recognition of apoptotic cells by the scavenger receptors of macrophages (42Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216Crossref Google Scholar), annexin V was used to identify PS exposed on the external membrane surface following rearrangement of the lipid bilayer. As shown in Fig. 7, UVA induced a dramatic increase in PS translocation as early as 4 h after exposure. However, the pretreatment with CsA (10 μm), VP (20 μm), or GSH (1 mm) significantly inhibited PS translocation at both 4 and 18 h after UVA irradiation. These findings suggest that GSH efflux contributes to UVA-induced PS translocation in HaCaT cells. It is noteworthy that inhibition of MRP1 is not the only effect of verapamil and cyclosporin A. Verapamil is known to be a calcium channel blocker and protect methoxyacetic acid-induced spermatocyte apoptosis in cultured rat seminiferous tubules (43Li L.H. Wine R.N. Miller D.S. Reece J.M. Smith M. Chapin R.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 105-119Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A increased K+-induced calcium influx (44Chou Y.C. Fong J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 169-173Google Scholar) and mitochondria calcium storage (45Salducci M.D. Chauvet-Monges A.M. Dussol B.M. Berland Y.F. Crevat A.D. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1995; 12: 518-522Google Scholar). Although the presence of verapamil or cyclosporin A might influence calcium homeostasis, no effect on DNA fragmentation or caspase activation, the two hallmarks for apoptosis, was observed in our study. This is the same with the addition of exogenous GSH. On the other hand, similar effect was observed by the presence of verapamil, cyclosporin A with exogenous GSH, which all inhibited GSH efflux and PS translocation. Therefore, we proposed that the effect of CsA and verapamil on UVA-triggered apoptosis was at least partially due to the inhibition of MRP1. Recent studies have revealed that several types of cells undergoing apoptosis induced by pro-apoptotic stimuli, such as diphenyleneiodonium, puromycin, ricin, and anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody, appeared to release GSH rapidly and selectively into the extracellular space (34Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Google Scholar, 35van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15420-15427Google Scholar, 36Oda T. Sadakata N. Komatsu N. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 715-721Google Scholar, 37Pullar J.M. Hampton M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19402-19407Google Scholar). However, neither the mechanisms involved in the transport of GSH nor the biological functional significance of this cellular GSH release is known. Prior to this study the involvement of GSH efflux in apoptosis of epidermal keratinocytes induced by UVA irradiation, an important environmental stress factor, was also unknown. In the present study, we have tested the putative mechanisms involved in GSH efflux and apoptosis of HaCaT cells induced by UVA. We have shown that exposure of HaCaT cells to UVA irradiation increased the transport of reduced GSH into the extracellular medium and that UVA-induced apoptosis was closely associated with this efflux. It is evident that UVA irradiation caused significant glutathione efflux in HaCaT cells considering the decreased intracellular total glutathione and increased extracellular total glutathione, provided that an energy source (glucose) was present. For cells kept in the dark, the efflux of intracellular GSH was much smaller, probably resulting from cystine withdrawal when the cells were switched from normal culture medium to cystine-free PBS or glucose PBS solution (35van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15420-15427Google Scholar,46Dethmers J.K. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7492-7496Google Scholar). We found that UVA-induced GSH efflux depended on the presence of glucose. Thus the transport of GSH into the extracellular space is an active process and energy-dependent (35van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15420-15427Google Scholar, 47Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Toxicology. 2001; 167: 3-23Google Scholar) and is not due to passive leakage as a result of the loss of membrane integrity. Immediately after UVA irradiation, only about 2% of cells were propidium iodide-positive and had lost their membrane integrity (data not shown). It seems unlikely that these damaged cells could be responsible for an increase in GSH efflux of almost 70%. Without glucose, UVA irradiation did not induce a greater GSH efflux than in dark controls, suggesting that GSH efflux under these conditions is due to cystine withdrawal following substitution of PBS for medium. Evidently the presence of glucose not only provides the energy for active transport of GSH but also maintains lower intracellular GSSG levels and higher GSH levels under UVA stress by providing a source of NADPH that is essential for the recycling of GSSG to GSH (48Verspohl E.J. Kaiser P. Wahl M. Ammon H.P. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 209-219Google Scholar, 49Sato K. Mimura H. Wakai K. Tomori N. Tsushima T. Shizume K. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 878-886Google Scholar). In previous studies, under UVA irradiation in the absence of glucose, the oxidation of both intracellular and extracellular GSH to GSSG was found to be the predominant reaction for glutathione, causing the depletion of intracellular GSH (24Tyrrell R.M. Pidoux M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 47: 405-412Google Scholar, 50Niggli H.J. Applegate L.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 680-684Google Scholar). No significant GSH efflux was observed, as was the case in our studies. The efflux of GSH was inhibited by exogenous addition of GSH and slowed down by GSH depletion (80%) with BSO. This suggests that the transport process is affected by the concentration gradient of GSH across the cell membrane. As far as the mechanisms and carriers involved in GSH transport are concerned, it is known that the multidrug resistance-associated proteins, MRP1 and MRP2, are responsible for GSH efflux in the liver (47Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Toxicology. 2001; 167: 3-23Google Scholar, 51Rebbeor J.F. Connolly G.C. Henson J.H. Boyer J.L. Ballatori N. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G417-G425Google Scholar, 52Kruh G.D. Zeng H. Rea P.A. Liu G. Chen Z.S. Lee K. Belinsky M.G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 493-501Google Scholar). Because the expression of MRP2 is restricted to liver, kidney, and gut, whereas MRP1 is found in many tissues (53Ishikawa T. Kuo M.T. Furuta K. Suzuki M. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2000; 38: 893-897Google Scholar), it is reasonable to suppose that in HaCaT keratinocytes, MRP1 may be the transporter protein that is activated by UVA irradiation to cause GSH efflux. Furthermore, the rapid efflux of GSH during UVA irradiation (within 2 h) suggests that this active transport process may be due to the activation of pre-existing transporter proteins by UVA in the presence of the energy provider glucose, rather than the induction of transporter proteins by UVA irradiation or oxidative stress (54Yamane Y. Furuichi M. Song R. Van N.T. Mulcahy R.T. Ishikawa T. Kuo M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31075-31085Google Scholar). Verapamil and CsA, inhibitors for MRP1, prevent the efflux of GSH induced by UVA irradiation, which implies the participation of MRP1 in the transport process of GSH in HaCaT cells. The rapid and active efflux of GSH induced by UVA irradiation in HaCaT cells could be an important biological response of keratinocytes to UVA-induced stress. Although little is known about the biological significance of GSH efflux in keratinocytes, we have found that apoptosis of HaCaT cells that occurred after GSH efflux is closely related to the specific GSH export process. GSH efflux has no effect on caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in our study. However, the increases in plasma membrane permeability and PS translocation during apoptosis of HaCaT cells are associated with GSH efflux. Inhibition of GSH efflux by the MRP1 inhibitors verapamil and CsA also prevents the loss of plasma membrane integrity and PS externalization. The presence of exogenous GSH has a similar effect to CsA and verapamil. Previous studies (56Drenou B. Blancheteau V. Burgess D.H. Fauchet R. Charron D.J. Mooney N.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4115-4124Google Scholar, 57Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 282-291Google Scholar) have shown that PS translocation is independent of both nuclear activity (55Reno F. Burattini S. Rossi S. Luchetti F. Columbaro M. Santi S. Papa S. Falcieri E. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 467-476Google Scholar) and caspase activation. It seems most likely that in HaCaT cells GSH efflux is involved in membrane rearrangement rather than caspase activation or DNA fragmentation in UVA-induced apoptosis. As a matter of fact, in apoptosis of Jurkat lymphocytes induced by anti-Fas/APO-1, GSH efflux was observed during apoptosis, but inhibition of this process did not affect DNA fragmentation (35van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15420-15427Google Scholar). Inhibition of GSH efflux has been shown to protect cells from apoptosis induced by puromycin in HepG2 cells but not in U937 cells by inhibiting DNA fragmentation (34Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Google Scholar). As in the case of puromycin-treated HepG2 cells (34Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Google Scholar), UVA-induced GSH efflux in HaCaT cells precedes DNA fragmentation; however, DNA fragmentation is not affected by inhibition of GSH efflux. It appears that cells stimulated by UVA to undergo apoptosis get rid of their GSH during the irradiation in order to optimize the functioning of the overall process. GSH efflux preceding apoptosis provides a novel mechanism to deplete GSH in the cells rather than oxidizing GSH to GSSG, which enhances the oxidative tonus without intervention of reactive oxygen species (34Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Google Scholar, 35van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15420-15427Google Scholar). The increased oxidative stress has been shown to result in the selective phosphatidylserine oxidation that precedes phosphatidylserine externalization in oxidant-induced apoptosis (58Kagan V.E.

Fabisiak J.P. Kagan V.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 1008-1018Google Scholar). Because externalized phosphatidylserine serves as an important signal for targeting recognition and elimination of apoptotic cells by macrophages (42Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216Crossref Google Scholar), the earlier phosphatidylserine translocation increased the macrophage recognition and phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells in vivo and thus minimized their potential to invoke inflammation or form neoplastic transformation.

These studies suggest that TNF-α has a beneficial role in viral infections and myocardial ischemia.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria has been recognized as a causative agent in myocardial depression during sepsis.

Little is known about the signaling downstream of TLR and upstream of NF-κB. A crucial role of p38 MAPK has been demonstrated in TNF-α expression induced by LPS in neutrophils (16Nick J.A. Avdi N.J.

However, whether p38 MAPK is involved in LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression in cardiomyocytes remains to be determined.Nitric-oxide synthase has three isoforms that serve different physiological functions as a result of their pattern of expression and the amount of nitric oxide (NO) produced upon activation (17Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar, 18Forstermann U. Close E.I. Pollock J.S. Nakane M. Schwarz P. Gath I. Kleinert H. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 1121-1131Google Scholar). Neuronal nitric-oxide synthase is mainly expressed in neuronal cells and regulates neurotransmission (19Wang Y. Newton D.C. Marsden P.A. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 21-43Google Scholar). Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed during inflammation or cytokine stimulation and produces high levels of NO that may be toxic to undesired microbes or tumor cells but may also harm healthy tissues (8Song W. Lu X. Feng Q. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 595-602Google Scholar, 17Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar, 20Feng Q. Lu X. Jones D.L. Shen J. Arnold J.M. Circulation. 2001; 104: 700-704Google Scholar). Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is constitutively expressed in a variety of cells including endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. Activation of eNOS produces low levels of NO, which has been implicated as a signaling molecule of many cellular processes, including endothelium-dependent relaxation of blood vessels, angiogenesis, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and modulation of myocardial function (17Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar, 21Kelly R.A. Balligand J.L. Smith T.W. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 363-380Google Scholar, 22Murohara T. Asahara T. Silver M.

These actions of NO have been ascribed to either the production of cGMP via soluble guanylate cyclase (GC) and activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase or the production of cAMP via adenylate cyclase (AC) and activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in cardiomyocytes (23Vila-Petroff M.G. Younes A. Egan J. Lakatta E.G. Sollott S.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1020-1031Google Scholar, 24Kalra D. Baumgarten G. Dibbs Z. Seta Y. Sivasubramanian N. Mann D.L. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1302-1307Google Scholar). Exogenous NO donors have been demonstrated to induce TNF-α production in differentiated U937 cells and in the myocardium (24Kalra D. Baumgarten G. Dibbs Z. Seta Y. Sivasubramanian N. Mann D.L. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1302-1307Google Scholar, 25Wang S. Yan L. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5959-5965Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown if endogenously produced NO from eNOS modulates TNF-α expression during LPS stimulation in cardiomyocytes.The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of eNOS in regulation of TNF-α expression upon LPS stimulation and to determine the contribution of p38 MAPK, cGMP, as well as cAMP to LPS-induced TNF-α expression in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes.DISCUSSIONThe major findings of the present study are that endogenous NO production from eNOS enhanced basal and LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression in cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. TNF-α expression was preceded by increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and selective inhibition of p38 MAPK abrogated TNF-α expression stimulated by LPS, suggesting an important role of p38 MAPK in LPS-induced TNF-α expression. We further demonstrated that the effects of NO were mediated through the cAMP/PKA-dependent p38 MAPK pathway. Our study demonstrated a novel signaling mechanism by which endogenously produced NO from eNOS modulates LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression in cardiomyocytes.NO from eNOS Enhances LPS-induced TNF-α Expression via cAMP-dependent PathwayCardiomyocytes constitutively express eNOS, which plays an important role in the regulation of myocardial function (21Kelly R.A. Balligand J.L. Smith T.W. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 363-380Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrated that eNOS-derived NO enhanced LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. This conclusion was based on the following three lines of evidence. First, deficiency in eNOS decreased both basal and LPS-stimulated TNF-α mRNA and protein expression in mouse cardiomyocytes. Second, treatment of NOS inhibitor l-NAME in wild-type cardiomyocytes decreased LPS-induced TNF-α expression to the level similar to that of eNOS−/− cardiomyocytes. Third, either NO donor DETA-NO or Adv-eNOS infection was able to restore LPS-stimulated TNF-α production in eNOS−/−cardiomyocytes to a similar level of wild-type cardiomyocytes. In the present study, TNF-α was measured at 4 h after LPS treatment when iNOS was not detectable. This is consistent with previous demonstrations that induction of iNOS in cardiomyocytes or heart occurs at late stages of LPS administration (4Grandel U. Fink L. Blum A. Heep M. Buerke M. Kraemer H.J. Mayer K. Bohle R.M. Seeger W. Grimminger F. Sibelius U. Circulation. 2002; 102: 2758-2764Google Scholar, 15Cowan D.B. Noria S. Stamm C. Garcia L.M. Poutias D.N. del Nido P.J. McGowan Jr., F.X. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 491-498Google Scholar). In addition, deficiency in iNOS did not influence the response to LPS in terms of TNF-α production in cardiomyocytes. Thus, the contribution of iNOS in LPS-induced TNF-α expression is negligible in the present study.Signal transductions of NO are mediated by both GC/cGMP-dependent and -independent pathways (23Vila-Petroff M.G. Younes A. Egan J. Lakatta E.G. Sollott S.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1020-1031Google Scholar). A recent study (24Kalra D. Baumgarten G. Dibbs Z. Seta Y. Sivasubramanian N. Mann D.L. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1302-1307Google Scholar) showed that exogenous NO donors induced TNF-α expression in cardiomyocytes via the GC/cGMP-dependent pathway. However, in the present study 8-Br-cGMP failed to mimic the effects of eNOS-derived NO on TNF-α expression in eNOS−/−cardiomyocytes. ODQ abrogated NO donor-stimulated cGMP production but did not affect TNF-α biosynthesis in wild-type cardiomyocytes in response to LPS. The results indicate that the effect of eNOS-derived NO on LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression is independent of cGMP in cardiomyocytes. Indeed, cGMP-independent effects of NO on LPS-induced TNF-α expression have been demonstrated in non-cardiomyocytes such as neutrophils (28Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb J.P. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M. Danner R.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4102-4109Google Scholar). Studies have also shown that low levels of NO activate AC and increase cAMP by a cGMP-independent mechanism in rat adult cardiomyocytes (23Vila-Petroff M.G. Younes A. Egan J. Lakatta E.G. Sollott S.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1020-1031Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, our data demonstrated that DETA-NO at low concentrations increased intracellular cAMP levels in eNOS−/− cardiomyocytes. Moreover, deficiency in eNOS decreased cAMP levels in cardiomyocytes. We further demonstrated that the effects of eNOS-derived NO on LPS-induced TNF-α production were mediated through AC/cAMP-dependent pathways in cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of cAMP production attenuated LPS-induced TNF-α expression in wild-type cardiomyocytes. cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP mimicked the effects of NO by increasing TNF-α production in eNOS−/− cardiomyocytes. These results were somewhat unexpected as previous studies (29Wagner D.R. Combes A. McTiernan C. Sanders V.J. Lemster B. Feldman A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 47-56Google Scholar) have shown that cAMP analogues at 10 μmol/liter concentrations inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α expression in cardiomyocytes. It is important to note that the physiological level of cAMP in cardiomyocytes is ∼6 pmol/mg protein (23Vila-Petroff M.G. Younes A. Egan J. Lakatta E.G. Sollott S.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1020-1031Google Scholar). To mimic the endogenous level of cAMP, we used low concentrations of cAMP analogue (10 and 100 pmol/liter) in the present study. Our results demonstrated that low levels of cAMP enhance basal as well as LPS-induced TNF-α production. Thus, cAMP may have completely different effects depending on its intracellular concentrations in cardiomyocytes. Whereas high concentrations of cAMP analogue (at micromolar range) inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α production, low levels of cAMP enhance LPS-induced TNF-α expression in cardiomyocytes.Activation of p38 MAPK Is Required for LPS-induced TNF-α ExpressionAn important finding in the present study is that LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression is mediated through p38 MAPK activation in neonatal cardiomyocytes. LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was less than 5 min, reaching a maximum within 30 min, which preceded the release of TNF-α production. More importantly, inhibition of p38 MAPK abrogated TNF-α expression induced by LPS. The mechanism by which LPS induces phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in cardiomyocytes remains elusive. It is possible that LPS stimulates p38 MAPK by activating protein tyrosine kinases through CD14 (30Comstock K.L. Krown K.A. Page M.T. Martin D. Ho P. Pedraza M. Castro E.N. Nakajima N. Glembotski C.C. Quintana P.J. Sabbadini R.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 2761-2775Google Scholar) and TLRs (13Baumgarten G. Knuefermann P. Nozaki N. Sivasubramanian N. Mann D.L. Vallejo J.G. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: 1617-1624Google Scholar), and by inducing oxidative stress through Rac1-dependent pathway (31Sanlioglu S. Williams C.M. Samavati L. Butler N.S. Wang G. McCray Jr., P.B. Ritchie T.C. Hunninghake G.W. Zandi E. Engelhardt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30188-30198Google Scholar).NO from eNOS Promotes LPS-stimulated p38 MAPK Activation via cAMP/PKA-dependent PathwayRecent studies (32Zheng M. Zhang S.J. Zhu W.Z. Ziman B. Kobilka B.K. Xiao R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40635-40640Google Scholar) have shown that cAMP activates p38 MAPK via a PKA-dependent mechanism in adult mouse cardiomyocytes. PKA inhibits Ser/Thr protein phosphatases and increases p38 MAPK activity (33Gupta R.C. Neumann J. Watanabe A.M. Lesch M. Sabbah H.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1159-H1164Google Scholar, 34Saxena M. Williams S. Tasken K. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 305-311Google Scholar). However, it is not known if cAMP/PKA-dependent p38 MAPK activation is responsible for the effects of NO on LPS-induced TNF-α expression. In the present study, inhibition of either NOS or AC activities attenuated LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and TNF-α release in cardiomyocytes. Addition of a NO donor or a cAMP analogue at low concentrations increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and TNF-α release induced by LPS in eNOS−/− cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, inhibition of PKA decreased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and TNF-α expression induced by LPS. Our results demonstrated that eNOS-derived NO enhances LPS-induced p38 MAPK and TNF-α expression via a cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway.In summary, the present study demonstrated for the first time that endogenously produced NO from eNOS enhances LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression in cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. Activation of p38 MAPK is essential in LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression. Moreover, the effects of NO on LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression are mediated through cAMP/PKA-dependent p38 MAPK mechanisms (Fig.10). These findings provide novel pathways leading to LPS induction of TNF-α in cardiomyocytes. The significance of the finding that eNOS-derived NO enhances LPS-induced TNF-α expression in cardiomyocytes in sepsis is presently not clear. High levels of TNF-α have been demonstrated to have detrimental effects on myocardial function. However, TNF-α is required for innate resistance to invading pathogens (2Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Google Scholar). It is possible, albeit speculative, that increased expression of TNF-α by eNOS leads to an enhancement of innate immune response in the heart, which in turn promotes the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer cells to the areas of the myocardium where the pathogens are located. Increased TNF-α expression has also been shown to induce manganese superoxide dismutase expression (35Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Google Scholar) which may reduce oxidative stress and tissue injury during sepsis. Therefore, eNOS enhancement of TNF-α production may confer some beneficial effects. However, the pathophysiological significance of the eNOS/cAMP/p38 MAPK pathway in sepsis requires further investigation.

Physiol. 2000; 279: H619-H629Google Scholar, 15Cowan D.B. Noria S. Stamm C. Garcia L.M. Poutias D.N. del Nido P.J. McGowan Jr., F.X. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 491-498Google Scholar). Little is known about the signaling downstream of TLR and upstream of NF-κB. A crucial role of p38 MAPK has been demonstrated in TNF-α expression induced by LPS in neutrophils (16Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Lehman L.A. McDonald P.P. Frasch S.C. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 851-858Google Scholar). However, whether p38 MAPK is involved in LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression in cardiomyocytes remains to be determined. Nitric-oxide synthase has three isoforms that serve different physiological functions as a result of their pattern of expression and the amount of nitric oxide (NO) produced upon activation (17Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar, 18Forstermann U. Close E.I. Pollock J.S. Nakane M. Schwarz P. Gath I. Kleinert H. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 1121-1131Google Scholar). Neuronal nitric-oxide synthase is mainly expressed in neuronal cells and regulates neurotransmission (19Wang Y. Newton D.C. Marsden P.A. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 21-43Google Scholar). Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed during inflammation or cytokine stimulation and produces high levels of NO that may be toxic to undesired microbes or tumor cells but may also harm healthy tissues (8Song W. Lu X. Feng Q. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 595-602Google Scholar, 17Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar, 20Feng Q. Lu X. Jones D.L. Shen J. Arnold J.M. Circulation. 2001; 104: 700-704Google Scholar). Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is constitutively expressed in a variety of cells including endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. Activation of eNOS produces low levels of NO, which has been implicated as a signaling molecule of many cellular processes, including endothelium-dependent relaxation of blood vessels, angiogenesis, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and modulation of myocardial function (17Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar, 21Kelly R.A. Balligand J.L. Smith T.W. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 363-380Google Scholar, 22Murohara T. Asahara T. Silver M.

These actions of NO have been ascribed to either the production of cGMP via soluble guanylate cyclase (GC) and activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase or the production of cAMP via adenylate cyclase (AC) and activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in cardiomyocytes (23Vila-Petroff M.G. Younes A. Egan J. Lakatta E.G. Sollott S.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1020-1031Google Scholar, 24Kalra D. Baumgarten G. Dibbs Z. Seta Y. Sivasubramanian N. Mann D.L. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1302-1307Google Scholar). Exogenous NO donors have been demonstrated to induce TNF-α production in differentiated U937 cells and in the myocardium (24Kalra D. Baumgarten G. Dibbs Z. Seta Y. Sivasubramanian N. Mann D.L. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1302-1307Google Scholar, 25Wang S. Yan L. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5959-5965Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown if endogenously produced NO from eNOS modulates TNF-α expression during LPS stimulation in cardiomyocytes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of eNOS in regulation of TNF-α expression upon LPS stimulation and to determine the contribution of p38 MAPK, cGMP, as well as cAMP to LPS-induced TNF-α expression in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. DISCUSSIONThe major findings of the present study are that endogenous NO production from eNOS enhanced basal and LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression in cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. TNF-α expression was preceded by increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and selective inhibition of p38 MAPK abrogated TNF-α expression stimulated by LPS, suggesting an important role of p38 MAPK in LPS-induced TNF-α expression. We further demonstrated that the effects of NO were mediated through the cAMP/PKA-dependent p38 MAPK pathway. Our study demonstrated a novel signaling mechanism by which endogenously produced NO from eNOS modulates LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression in cardiomyocytes.NO from eNOS Enhances LPS-induced TNF-α Expression via cAMP-dependent PathwayCardiomyocytes constitutively express eNOS, which plays an important role in the regulation of myocardial function (21Kelly R.A. Balligand J.L. Smith T.W. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 363-380Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrated that eNOS-derived NO enhanced LPS-stimulated TNF-α expression in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. This conclusion was based on the following three lines of evidence. First, deficiency in eNOS decreased both basal and LPS-stimulated TNF-α mRNA and protein expression in mouse cardiomyocytes. Second, treatment of NOS inhibitor l-NAME in wild-type cardiomyocytes decreased LPS-induced TNF-α expression to the level similar to that of eNOS−/− cardiomyocytes. Third, either NO donor DETA-NO or Adv-eNOS infection was able to restore LPS-stimulated TNF-α production in eNOS−/−cardiomyocytes to a similar level of wild-type cardiomyocytes. In the present study, TNF-α was measured at 4 h after LPS treatment when iNOS was not detectable. This is consistent with previous demonstrations that induction of iNOS in cardiomyocytes or heart occurs at late stages of LPS administration (4Grandel U. Fink L. Blum A. Heep M. Buerke M. Kraemer H.J. Mayer K. Bohle R.M. Seeger W. Grimminger F. Sibelius U. Circulation. 2002; 102: 2758-2764Google Scholar, 15Cowan D.B. Noria S. Stamm C. Garcia L.M. Poutias D.N. del Nido P.J. McGowan Jr., F.X. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 491-498Google Scholar). In addition, deficiency in iNOS did not influence the response to LPS in terms of TNF-α production in cardiomyocytes. Thus, the contribution of iNOS in LPS-induced TNF-α expression is negligible in the present study.Signal transductions of NO are mediated by both GC/cGMP-dependent and -independent pathways (23Vila-Petroff"
https://openalex.org/W2055923860,"Both apocalmodulin (Ca2+-free calmodulin) and Ca2+-calmodulin bind to and regulate the activity of skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor, RYR1). Both forms of calmodulin protect sites after amino acids 3630 and 3637 on RYR1 from trypsin cleavage. Only apocalmodulin protects sites after amino acids 1982 and 1999 from trypsin cleavage. Ca2+-calmodulin and apocalmodulin both bind to two different synthetic peptides representing amino acids 3614–3643 and 1975–1999 of RYR1, but Ca2+-calmodulin has a higher affinity than apocalmodulin for both peptides. Cysteine 3635, within the 3614–3643 sequence of RYR1, can form a disulfide bond with a cysteine on an adjacent subunit within the RYR1 tetramer. The second cysteine is now shown to be between amino acids 2000 and 2401. The close proximity of the cysteines forming the intersubunit disulfide to the two sites that bind calmodulin suggests that calmodulin is binding at a site of intersubunit contact, perhaps with one lobe bound between amino acids 3614 and 3643 on one subunit and the second lobe bound between amino acids 1975 and 1999 on an adjacent subunit. This model is consistent with the finding that Ca2+-calmodulin and apocalmodulin each bind to a single site per RYR1 subunit (Rodney, G. G., Williams, B. Y., Strasburg, G. M., Beckingham, K., and Hamilton, S. L. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 7807–7812). Both apocalmodulin (Ca2+-free calmodulin) and Ca2+-calmodulin bind to and regulate the activity of skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor, RYR1). Both forms of calmodulin protect sites after amino acids 3630 and 3637 on RYR1 from trypsin cleavage. Only apocalmodulin protects sites after amino acids 1982 and 1999 from trypsin cleavage.

This model is consistent with the finding that Ca2+-calmodulin and apocalmodulin each bind to a single site per RYR1 subunit (Rodney, G. G., Williams, B. Y., Strasburg, G.

(2000) Biochemistry 39, 7807–7812). sarcoplasmic reticulum calmodulin apocalmodulin Ca2+-calmodulin dithiothreitol 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid antibody The skeletal muscle Ca2+release channel (also known as the ryanodine receptor, RYR1) is a homotetramer containing four 565-kDa subunits; four-fifths of the molecule is cytoplasmic, and the remaining one-fifth is membrane-spanning and/or luminal to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).1 Ca2+ and several endogenous proteins that bind within the large cytoplasmic domain modulate the activity of RYR1. In the muscle fiber, these endogenous modulators probably act together to regulate RYR1 channel activity and, ultimately, Ca2+ release from the SR. One of these modulators, calmodulin (CaM), binds to RyR1 at both nanomolar and micromolar Ca2+ concentrations (1Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Google Scholar). Apocalmodulin (apoCaM) is a weak partial agonist, whereas Ca2+-calmodulin (Ca2+CaM) is an inhibitor of RyR1 (1Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Google Scholar). CaM in both its Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free forms binds to one site per RYR1 subunit (2Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Google Scholar). ApoCaM and Ca2+CaM bound to RYR1 protect sites after amino acids 3630 and 3637 from tryptic digestion (3Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar), suggesting that this sequence may form part of both the apoCaM and Ca2+CaM binding sites. Evidence that the Ca2+CaM and apoCaM binding sites are overlapping includes the following: (a) apoCaM and Ca2+CaM have the same number of binding sites (2Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Google Scholar); (b) the binding sites for both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM are destroyed by trypsin at the same rate (3Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar); (c) the two forms of CaM protect each other's binding sites from tryptic destruction (3Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar); (d) the protected cleavage sites within the 3614–3643 region are the same in high and low Ca2+; (e) the binding of [35S]E1234Q (a mutant CaM that cannot bind Ca2+ at any of the four Ca2+ binding sites) is completely inhibited by Ca2+CaM (2Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Google Scholar); (f) no cooperativity in binding has been detected 2S. L. Hamilton, unpublished observation.2S. L. Hamilton, unpublished observation.; (g) mutations W3620A or L3624A in RYR1 greatly decrease the affinity of both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM binding for RYR1 (4Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar); (h) the 3614–3643 peptide binds the C-lobe but not the N-lobe of both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM (5Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Google Scholar); and (i) the interaction of 3614–3643 with CaM increases the Ca2+affinity only of the C-lobe of CaM (5Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Google Scholar). These findings support a model in which the C-lobe of both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM binds to the sequence between amino acids 3614–3643. The C-lobe binding sites for apoCaM and Ca2+CaM are overlapping, nonidentical sites, and CaM shifts N-terminally within the site when Ca2+ binds to the C-lobe (2Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ to the C-lobe of CaM is responsible for its conversion from an activator to an inhibitor of RYR1 (2Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Google Scholar). Samso and Wagenknecht (6Samso M. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1349-1353Google Scholar) have localized the binding site for CaM in the three-dimensional structure of RYR1. They found that the two forms of CaM bind on the sides of the cytoplasmic domain of RYR1 to overlapping locations with centers separated by 33 Å. This large translocation, especially in light of a common C-lobe binding site (2Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Google Scholar,3Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar, 5Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Google Scholar), suggests that the binding sequence is moving a relatively large distance when the channel changes its conformation in response to CaM and Ca2+ and/or there is a major movement of one lobe of calmodulin when Ca2+ binds to both CaM and RYR1. Additional information about the location of the CaM binding site in the RYR1 tetramer has come from oxidation studies. An intersubunit disulfide bond can be formed by treating RYR1 with oxidizing agents (7Zhang J.-Z. Wu Y. Williams B.Y. Rodney G. Mandel F. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C46-C53Google Scholar, 8Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S.J. Zhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Google Scholar, 9Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3748Google Scholar), and the formation of this cross-link is blocked by bound Ca2+CaM or apoCaM (7Zhang J.-Z. Wu Y. Williams B.Y. Rodney G. Mandel F. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C46-C53Google Scholar). These data suggest that the CaM binding site may be localized to a site of intersubunit contact. Consistent with this, one of the cysteines involved in this cross-link is found within the amino acid 3614–3643 binding site for the C-lobe of CaM (10Moore C.P. Zhang J.-Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36831-36834Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that the CaM could be interacting simultaneously with two subunits in the RYR1 tetramer. Since the C-lobe of CaM appears to bind primarily within the 3614–3643 sequence, the site on the second subunit might represent an interaction site for the N-lobe of CaM. We have demonstrated the importance of the N-lobe in binding and regulation of RYR1 using N-terminal CaM mutants (5Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Google Scholar). The N-lobe of CaM appears to bind at an unidentified location distinct from that of the C-lobe (5Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Google Scholar). We now identify a new sequence that could be the binding site for the N-lobe of CaM on an adjacent subunit in the RYR1 tetramer. Dithiothreitol (DTT), 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 3-[cyclyhexylamino]-1-propane sulfonic acid (CAPS), bovine brain calmodulin, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Amplify and [3H]N-ethymaleimide were obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. All antibodies except Ab 5029 were prepared in rabbit immunized with synthetic peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Immunizations were performed either by our laboratory or by Pelfreeze Laboratories (Rogers, AR) using Freund's complete adjuvant, and the antibodies were purified as we have previously described (8Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S.J. Zhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Google Scholar). Ab 5029 was graciously provided by Dr. Andrew Marks (Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons). E1234Q CaM was graciously provided by Dr. Kathleen Beckingham (Rice University). SR membranes were prepared as previously described (11Hawkes M.J. Dı́az-Muñoz M. Hamilton S.L. Membr. Biochem. 1989; 8: 133-145Google Scholar) from rabbit hind leg and back strap white skeletal muscle and purified using sucrose gradient centrifugation. (N+3)CaM was expressed and purified as described by Xiong et al. (5Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Google Scholar). SR membranes (10 mg of protein/ml) in 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 100 μm CaCl2were treated with trypsin for 1–5 min at 37 °C at a trypsin/protein ratio of 1:1000. Digestion was halted by the addition of a 10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. After solubilization in 2% CHAPS, proteolyzed complexes were purified over 5–20% linear sucrose gradients containing 0.4% CHAPS, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) centrifuging at 24,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28 rotor for 18 h. Fractions were collected, and fractions containing the RYR1 proteolytic complex were identified using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Fractions from the sucrose gradient were compared by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were prepared for sequencing as described previously (12Callaway C. Seryshev A. Wang J.P. Slavik K. Needleman D.H. Cantu C. Wu Y. Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15876-15884Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing was performed in the Core Protein Facility by Dr. Richard Cook at Baylor College of Medicine. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) or Schägger and von Jagow (14Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). Protein samples subjected to SDS-PAGE were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for 16–18 h at 25 V in 5% methanol, 10 mm CAPS (pH 11.0) at 4 °C. Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies was performed as described by Wu et al. (8Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S.J. Zhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Google Scholar). The blots were developed using the SuperSignal chemoluminescence substrate (Pierce). The purified proteolytic complex was treated with 5 mm N-ethymaleimide for 20 min at 4 °C before solubilization in SDS sample buffer. 7.5% polyacrylamide gels were used for the first dimension electrophoresis. Lanes were excised from the first dimensional gel, and the gel strips were incubated with 25–50 mm DTT in the sample buffer without SDS and bromophenol blue for 1 h at room temperature (23 °C). The gel strip was then loaded on top of a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel for the second dimensional electrophoresis. The gap between the gel strip and the second dimensional resolving gel was sealed with melted agarose (1% agarose, 2% SDS, 50 mmDTT), and the gels were electrophoresed for 1–2 h at 120–170 V at 4 °C. The two-dimensional gels were subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Analysis of the interaction of the peptides with CaM by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was performed as we have previously described (15Pate P. Mochca-Morales J. Wu Y. Zhang J.Z. Rodney G.G. Serysheva I.I. Williams B.Y. Anderson M.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39786-39792Google Scholar). Our previous studies using CaM to protect cleavage sites on RYR1 were primarily performed at high Ca2+ concentrations. Under these conditions, the major cleavage sites protected by CaM were after amino acids 3630 and 3637 (3Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar). With longer digestion times and in <10 nm Ca2+ we have now identified two additional protected sites. The fragmentation patterns obtained by digestion of RYR1 in membranes at nanomolar Ca2+ concentration in the presence and absence of CaM are shown in Fig.1 (A, lanes a and b, and B, lanes a and b). To aid in the visualization of the protected fragments, the purified proteolytic complexes were also labeled with [3H]N-ethylmaleimide and visualized by fluorography (Fig. 1 A, lanes c and d, and Fig.2, lanes c andd). Protected bands that we have previously identified (3Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar) are clearly seen in these gels, and, in addition, a new 71-kDa band is seen in the absence but not in the presence of apoCaM.Figure 2Effect of (N+3) apoCaM on the digestion patterns. The experiment described in Fig. 1 was repeated using 5 μm CaM (lane b) or 5 μm (N+3) CaM (lane c) for protection. Lane a shows the proteolytic pattern obtained in the absence of CaM. Samples were electrophoresed on Schägger gels. Molecular mass markers are shown to theleft and are the same as in Fig. 1 A. Lanes d–f show the autoradiograms of samples a–c.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We routinely use two different one-dimensional SDS-PAGE systems to analyze the proteolytic fragments: (a) the gel system of Schägger and von Jagow (14Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar) for separation of smaller fragments and (b) 7.5% Laemmli gels (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) for separation of larger fragments. In the Schägger and von Jagow gels, large fragments are difficult to separate. The separation of these high molecular weight fragments into multiple bands is more clearly achieved in the Laemmli gels (Fig. 1 C). However, smaller fragments are best differentiated in the Schägger and von Jaggow gels (Fig.1 A). Also, fragments with molecular masses less than ∼40 kDa run with the dye front on the 7.5% Laemmli gels. The identity of the tryptic fragments was determined by Western blotting with sequence-specific antibodies (Fig.3 and Table I) and with N-terminal sequencing (Table II). The tentative assignment of the C-terminal amino acid for each of the fragments is based on both the apparent size and our previously determined tryptic digestion sites (12Callaway C. Seryshev A. Wang J.P. Slavik K. Needleman D.H. Cantu C. Wu Y. Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15876-15884Google Scholar). To assess precursor/product relationships, the intensities of the bands were analyzed by densitometry (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with our previous findings, a cleavage at amino acid 3630 and/or 3637 converts fragment 1 (apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa, N-terminal amino acid 3120) to fragment 6 (∼128 kDa, N-terminal amino acid 3120). Fragment 6 is found in variable amounts from preparation to preparation. In reduced membranes, fragment 6 is rapidly converted to fragment 9, but this cleavage is slowed if the membranes are oxidized (see below). Fragment 2 (∼158 kDa, also beginning with amino acid 3120) is directly converted to fragment 9 (∼110 kDa, beginning with amino acid 3631). Both Ca2+CaM and apoCaM protect the sites after arginine 3630 and 3637 from trypsin cleavage (3Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L.

Open table in a new tab A second site protected by apoCaM is also seen (Fig. 1 A). When the digestion was performed at <10 nmCa2+ concentration, fragment 12 is found in samples digested in the absence but not in the presence of CaM (Fig.1 A, lane a versus lane b). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of this band identified it as beginning with amino acid 1509. To determine whether there is another site protected by apoCaM, we looked for both the precursor of this fragment at a higher molecular weight and the other part of a larger precursor fragment at a lower molecular weight. The fluorogram shows that the broad band around 110–125 kDa appears to be even broader when the digestion was performed in the presence of apoCaM (Fig. 1 A, lanes b andd). We find a fragment with an apparent molecular mass of about 123 kDa (fragment 7) with an N-terminal sequence beginning with amino acid 1509. Furthermore, there is at least three times more of this fragment (determined by N-terminal sequencing) in the 110–120-kDa band if apoCaM is present during the proteolysis compared with that found in the absence of CaM. Fragment 7 but not fragment 12 was recognized by an antibody to amino acid 2391 (Fig.4). These findings suggest that apoCaM protects a site within fragment 7 from tryptic cleavage. The size of the piece removed from fragment 7 to form fragment 12 should be around 50 kDa, and, indeed, bands in the 50-kDa region were recognized by Ab 2391 (Fig. 3). We sequenced the broad 50-kDa band and found that it is composed of multiple fragments, including a sequence beginning with amino acid 1983 (fragment 14); a sequence beginning with either amino acid 2402, 2403, or 2404 (fragment 15, carboxyl-terminal end with a jagged cut); and smaller and variable amounts of a fragment beginning with amino acid 2000 (fragment 16). In some preparations, there were also small amounts of a fragment of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, SERCA 1, in this band. When CaM was present during the proteolysis very little of either fragment 14 or 16 could be detected in the ∼50-kDa band by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, suggesting that these two fragments are derived from cleavage of fragment 7. The appearance of the fragment 14 with an N-terminal sequence beginning after arginine 1982 appears to correlate most closely with the appearance of fragment 12 and the disappearance of fragment 7, suggesting that it represents the first cleavage. The cleavage at 1999 may represent a second protected site, or it may arise as a secondary cleavage after the primary cut at arginine 1982. ApoCaM is a weak partial agonist of the channel. We found that the addition of 3 amino acids to the N terminus of CaM produces a mutant CaM (designated (N+3)CaM) that binds with higher affinity than wild-type apoCaM but does not activate the channel (5Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Google Scholar). The cleavage of the fragment 7 to fragments 12 and 14 is also protected by (N+3)CaM (Fig. 2), suggesting that this represents a direct protection of this site from proteolysis rather than a protection arising allosterically. The presence of Ca2+ during the proteolysis with trypsin does not greatly alter the tryptic digestion pattern. When we examined the effect of CaM on the proteolysis patterns at high Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 3 A), we found that fragment 12 is present in the proteolytic complexes prepared both with and without CaM (Fig. 3 A, lane a versus lane b), indicating that Ca2+CaM did not prevent the cleavage after arginine 1982. Ca2+CaM did protect the previously described 158-kDa band (fragment 2) to 110-kDa (fragment 9) conversion (a cleavage after amino acid 3630/3637). We have demonstrated a cleavage site that is protected by apoCaM on the Ca2+-free RYR1, raising the question of whether the protection is due to the conformation of CaM or RYR1 or both. A mutant CaM that cannot bind Ca2+ at any of the four Ca2+ binding sites (E1234Q) was tested for the ability to protect the 1982 cleavage site on the Ca2+-bound RYR1. Fig. 3 B shows that the conversion of fragment 7 to fragments 12 and 14 occurs in high Ca2+ in the presence and absence of Ca2+CaM (Fig. 3 B, lanes a and b). The presence of E1234Q, however, partially prevents this conversion (Fig. 3 B, lane c, and C). We conclude that Ca2+-free CaM can protect the 1982 cleavage site on the Ca2+-bound RYR1, indicating that the protection has more to do with the conformation of CaM than any Ca2+-driven changes in RYR1. Other tryptic fragments of RYR1 were identified in these experiments and are listed in Table I. These were all consistent with the fragments that we had previously identified (12Callaway C. Seryshev A. Wang J.P. Slavik K. Needleman D.H. Cantu C. Wu Y. Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15876-15884Google Scholar). Western blotting with four different antipeptide antibodies is shown in Fig.4. In an attempt to identify the amino acids involved in binding CaM, we made a series of synthetic peptides corresponding to the RYR1 sequence around the protected cleavage site (Table III). These peptides were screened for ability to bind to CaM at both high and low Ca2+concentrations. In this gel system, the peptide alone does not enter the gel due to its positive charge. The complex of the peptide and CaM can be seen above the free CaM band, and the extent of interaction was assessed by the disappearance of the free CaM band. Representative gels using low and high Ca2+ concentrations are shown in Fig.5, A and B, respectively. The summarized data (I/I 0; the ratio of intensity of the CaM band in the presence of the peptide compared with that of CaM alone) from the densitometric analysis of the CaM band at low and high Ca2+ with increasing peptide/CaM ratios are shown in Fig.5 C. By nondenaturing gel electrophoreses, only one peptide, 1975–1999, binds CaM. 1975–1999 binds Ca2+CaM with an affinity comparable with the 3614–3649 peptide (16Rodney G.G. Krol J. Williams B. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12430-12435Google Scholar). ApoCaM (Fig. 5) also binds to the 1975–1999 peptide but with lower apparent affinity. Other methods to detect the interaction (pull-down assays with biotinylated 1975–1999 and strepavidin beads, and tryptophan fluorescence with a tryptophan substituted for the 1978 phenylalanine) also show a weak interaction of the peptide with apoCaM (data not shown). These findings suggest that although Ca2+CaM binds to the 1975–1999 sequence, its binding does not protect the 1982/1999 cleavage sites. In contrast, apoCaM binds more weakly to this sequence but does protect the cleavage site. There are a number of possible explanations for the different abilities of Ca2+CaM and apoCaM to protect the 1982/1999 cleavage sites: (a) both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM bind to this sequence, but Ca2+CaM does not protect the site (perhaps due to its conformation or to a slightly shifted interaction site); (b) apoCaM may bind at a different site on RYR1 and protect the cleavage site either sterically or allosterically; (c) the conformational change that occurs in RYR1 as a result of the inhibitory action of Ca2+CaM may increase the exposure of the 1983/1999 cleavage site; or (d) the binding affinities to the peptides do not accurately reflect the affinities of these regions for CaM in the native protein. Whether the 1975–1999 synthetic peptide binds only the N-lobe of CaM is not yet known.Table IIISynthetic peptidesPeptideSequenceApoCaM bindingCaCaM bindingR1975–1999SRYALLMRAFTMSAAETARRTREFR++R1982–2016AFTMSAAETARRTREFRSPPQEQINMLLHFKDEA−−R1997–2024EFRSPPQEQINMLLHFKDEADEEDCPLP−−R2020–2048DCPLPEDIRQDLQDFHQDLLAHCGIQLEG−−R2055–2081EETSLSSRLRSLLETVRLVKKKEEK−− Open table in a new tab Cysteine 3635, located within the binding site for the C-lobe of CaM, can be cross-linked to a cysteine located on an adjacent subunit within the RYR1 tetramer (10Moore C.P. Zhang J.-Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36831-36834Google Scholar). This cross-linking occurs in both 200 μm Ca2+ and at less than 10 nm Ca2+ concentrations (Fig.6) and is blocked by apoCaM and Ca2+CaM (3Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar, 7Zhang J.-Z. Wu Y. Williams B.Y. Rodney G. Mandel F. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Am. J.

The close proximity of a neighboring subunit to the C-lobe binding site raises the question of whether the N-lobe of CaM is binding to a different subunit from the one that binds the C-lobe. To address this question, we cross-linked RYR1 with the disulfide-inducing agent diamide and treated the membranes with trypsin. After stopping the proteolysis with soybean trypsin inhibitor, the membranes were solubilized in CHAPS, and the RYR1 proteolytic complex was purified. The proteolytic patterns under both reducing and nonreducing conditions were analyzed on both Schägger and von Jaggow (Fig. 7 A,lanes a and b) and Laemmli gels (Fig.7 B, lanes a and b). A number of minor bands at high molecular weight can be seen in the unreduced sample. Differences between the reduced and unreduced samples include the following. (a) There are several new bands in the 150–160-kDa region; (b) there is a decrease in the intensity of the 50-kDa band (containing fragments 14, 15, and 16); and (c) a band with an apparent molecular mass of 61 kDa (fragment 13), which is a fragment of SERCA 1 beginning with amino acid 208, undergoes a mobility shift as indicated by the diagonal arrow between lanes a andb in panels A and B. A Western blot of a 7.5% gel with antibodies 2391 and 2727 (Fig. 7,C and D) shows that the fragment containing the “2391 sequence” but not the “2727 sequence” may be involved in formation of higher molecular weight complexes. The data obtained in this experiment suggest that the RYR1 fragments that are most likely to be involved in the cross-linking are fragments 1, 2, and 9 and a component the 50-kDa band.Figure 7The effect of diamide on the fragmentation pattern of RYR1.

Richards F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 8005-8018Google Scholar). In a previous study using this approach with a calpain-digested and purified RYR1 complex, we localized the second cysteine to a region between amino acids 1400 and 2100 (8Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S.J. Zhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Google Scholar). We have also found that all off-diagonal spots can be eliminated by preincubation of the membranes with CaM prior to cross-linking.2 Our data (3Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L.

The two-dimensional gel of RYR1 that was cross-linked with diamide to produce dimers (also designated oxidized RYR1), proteolyzed with trypsin in nanomolar Ca2+, and then purified, is shown in Fig. 8 A. It should be noted that there are some subtle differences in the tryptic digest pattern obtained with oxidized RYR1, including (as discussed below) larger quantities of fragment 6, and the cleavage at 1999 predominates over cleavage at 1983. Western blots of the two-dimensional gels using Ab 2391 and 2727 are shown in Fig. 8, B and C, respectively. Four major off-diagonal spots (a–d) are clearly detected and appear to represent complexes prior to reduction of a–c and b–d. Using N-terminal Edman sequencing of the two upper bands, we found that both spots a and b begin with the N-terminal amino acid sequence AVVAXFRM, indicating that their N-terminal amino acid is 3631 and corresponds to fragments 6 and 9, respectively.Spots c and d both begin with amino acid 2000, and both correspond to fragment 16. We did not detect the sequence beginning at 1983, presumably because both cleavages occur in these experiments using oxidized RYR1. In all of our oxidized preparations, fragment 16 was present in higher amounts than fragment 14, suggesting that oxidized RYR1 protein is more readily digested at this site than reduced RYR1. This is consistent with our findings with calpain fragments, where calpain cleaved a new site around amino acid ∼2100 in the oxidized RYR1 (8Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S.J. Zhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Google Scholar). From the size of these fragments and our previous identification of tryptic fragments, we propose that the fragments containing cysteine 3635 (spot a, corresponding to fragment 6, andspot b, corresponding to fragment 9) are cross-linked by diamide treatment to a cysteine located in the fragment 16, found in both spots c and d. How CaM can function as both an activator and an inhibitor of RYR1 is unknown. In addition, there appears to be a very large translocation of CaM within the three-dimensional structure of RYR1 when Ca2+ binds to both CaM and RYR1. Clues to the molecular mechanisms contributing to these phenomena can be obtained from an analysis of the binding sites for apoCaM and Ca2+CaM on RYR1. A binding site for CaM on the native RYR1 was identified using the ability of bound CaM to protect sites on RYR1 from tryptic cleavage (10Moore C.P. Zhang J.-Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36831-36834Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide composed of amino acids 3614–3643 was then shown to bind both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM, and cysteine 3635 was identified as one of the amino acids involved in the intersubunit disulfide bond (2Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Google Scholar, 10Moore C.P. Zhang J.-Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36831-36834Google Scholar). ApoCaM requires additional amino acids between 3634 and 3643, whereas Ca2+CaM needs only amino acids 3614–3634. We recently found, however, that only the C-lobe of CaM binds to this sequence (5Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Google Scholar). This raised questions about the binding site for the N-lobe. Deletion of amino acids 2–8 of calmodulin greatly decreases the affinity of calmodulin for RYR1 at both nanomolar and micromolar Ca2+ concentrations (5Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Google Scholar). These amino acids are also required for maximal inhibition of the channel at micromolar Ca2+ concentrations. In contrast, the addition of 3 amino acids to the N terminus of calmodulin increases its affinity for RYR1 at both nanomolar and micromolar Ca2+ concentrations but destroys its functional effects on RYR1 in nanomolar Ca2+(5Xiong L.W. Newman R.A. Rodney G.G. Thomas O. Zhang J.Z. Persechini A. Shea M.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40862-40870Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the N-lobe of CaM is binding to RYR1, but its binding site is likely to be noncontiguous with the C-lobe site. In the current study, we have attempted to identify the location of the binding site for the N-lobe of CaM. To identify the N-lobe binding site, we used trypsin digestion of the membrane-bound RYR1. Tryptic fragments were identified by N-terminal sequencing and Western blotting. Fig. 9illustrates the tryptic digest patterns detected in the presence (yellow lines) and absence of apoCaM (red lines). In low Ca2+, we found that, in addition to the protected sites after arginines 3630 and 3637, there are sites after amino acid 1982 (and, possibly 1999) protected by apoCaM. Since apoCaM is an activator of RYR1, the protection could be arising from a burying of the site due to the conformational change in RYR1. However, an inactive CaM with 3 additional N-terminal amino acids, (N+3)CaM also protects the 1982/1999 sites, suggesting that this site is not protected as the result of a change in the conformation of the binding site arising from the ability of apoCaM to activate RYR1. (N+3)CaM is a high affinity antagonist of the Ca2+-free RYR1. The sites after amino acids 1982 and 1999 are not protected by Ca2+CaM, although the 1975–1999 sequence binds Ca2+CaM. It is possible that Ca2+ binding to CaM bound to this sequence produces a conformational change in CaM itself or a movement of CaM within the binding site that uncovers this site. Another possible explanation of the lack of protection of this site by Ca2+CaM is that there is an increased exposure of the site arising from the Ca2+CaM-driven inhibition of RYR1 activity. This possibility is currently being investigated. The lack of protection by Ca2+CaM does not, however, appear to arise from a conformational change driven solely by Ca2+ binding to RYR1, since a Ca2+ binding site mutant of CaM (E1234Q) can protect the 1983/1999 cleavage sites. E1234Q is a partial agonist of RYR1 at all Ca2+ concentrations (2Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Google Scholar) and provides some protection of the 1982 and 1999 cleavage sites on the Ca2+-bound RYR1, suggesting that the apoCaM binding site is similar in the Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free RYR1. The site identified in the protection and peptide studies (amino acids 1975–1999) is clearly not close to the C-lobe binding site in the primary sequence of RYR1, but is it on the same subunit? Cysteine 3635 is one of the cysteines involved in the formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond within the RYR1 tetramer (10Moore C.P. Zhang J.-Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36831-36834Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the N-lobe binding site is also on a second subunit. One approach to assessing this is to identify the location of the second cysteine and determine whether it is close to the site protected by apoCaM. Consistent with the idea that the N-lobe binding site is on a second subunit, we previously demonstrated that the second cysteine was located somewhere between amino acids 1400 and 2100 (8Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S.J. Zhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Google Scholar), a sequence that contains the apoCaM-protected tryptic site. To narrow the location of the cross-linking cysteine, we used diamide as a disulfide-inducing cross-linker and tryptic digestion to generate fragments. We found that fragments containing cysteine 3635 could be cross-linked to a 50-kDa fragment that had an N-terminal sequence corresponding to amino acids 2000 and from its size was predicted to extend to amino acid 2401. These studies place the cysteine involved in the intersubunit cross-link with cysteine 3635 in close vicinity of the apoCaM-protected cleavage site at amino acid 1982, suggesting that the N-lobe of CaM is binding to the subunit that is adjacent to the binding site for the C-lobe. In summary, we propose that CaM binds to RYR1 with its C-lobe bound between amino acids 3614 and 3643 and its N-lobe bound to the adjacent subunit between amino acids 1975 and 1999, and Ca2+ binding to CaM allows its movement within these two sequences to inhibit channel activity.

We suggest that C3d may constitute a useful lead for the development of compounds for treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. neural CAM cell adhesion molecule fibroblast growth factor FGF receptor Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase cAMP- response element-binding protein poly-l-lysin bovine serum albumin days in vitro The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)1 plays a key role in morphogenesis of the nervous system (2Tomasiewicz H. Ono K. Yee D. Thompson C. Goridis C. Rutishauser U. Magnuson T. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1163-1174Google Scholar) and in remodeling of neuronal connections associated with regenerative and cognitive processes (for review, see Ref. 3Rønn L.C.B. Berezin V. Bock E. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2000; 18: 193-199Google Scholar). The extracellular part of NCAM binds to a variety of ligands, the most important being the NCAM molecule itself. Homophilic NCAM binding is thought to involve the first five immunoglobulin (IgI–IgV) modules of NCAM with a double reciprocal interaction between the IgI and IgII modules of two interacting NCAM molecules (4Kiselyov V.V.

Larsen I.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 389-393Google Scholar). Upon homophilic NCAM binding, intracellular signaling cascades, including the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras-MAPK) and phospholipase Cγ-associated pathways, are activated (6Kolkova K,. Novitskaya V. Pedersen N. Berezin V. Bock E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2238-2246Google Scholar), resulting in neurite outgrowth. Antibody interventive studies have shown NCAM necessary for the induction and maintenance of long term potentiation and for stable memory retention in vivo (7Luhti A. Laurent J.P. Figurov A. Muller D. Schachner M. Nature. 1994; 372: 777-779Google Scholar, 8Rønn L.C.B. Bock E. Linneman D. Jahnsen H. Brain Res. 1995; 677: 145-151Google Scholar), suggesting that NCAM is involved in synaptic plasticity. The modulation of processes of neuronal differentiation and plasticity through NCAM has been impeded by the absence of small synthetic agonists mimicking homophilic or heterophilic interactions of NCAM. However, recently, a new synthetic ligand of NCAM, the C3-peptide, has been identified by means of combinatorial chemistry. The dendrimeric tetramer of this peptide (C3d) binds to the IgI module of NCAM with a dissociation constant similar to that of the natural homophilic ligand, the IgII module (1Rønn L.C. B Olsen M. Ostergaard S. Kiselyov V. Berezin V. Mortensen M.T. Lerche M.H. Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Saffell J.L. Doherty P. Poulsen F.M. Bock E. Holm A. Saffells J.L. Nat.

In vitro, C3d disrupts NCAM-mediated cell adhesion, induces neurite outgrowth, and triggers intracellular signaling cascades similar to those activated by physiological homophilic NCAM binding (1Rønn L.C. B Olsen M. Ostergaard S. Kiselyov V. Berezin V. Mortensen M.T. Lerche M.H. Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Saffell J.L. Doherty P. Poulsen F.M. Bock E. Holm A. Saffells J.L. Nat.

In vivo, C3d has been demonstrated to induce amnesia in a passive avoidance learning paradigm in the adult rat and to prevent NCAM internalization in a 3–4-h period following task acquisition (9Foley A.G. Hartz B.P. Callagher H.C. Rønn L.C.B. Berezin V Bock E. Regan C.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2607-2613Google Scholar), indicating that the peptide is capable of modulating synaptic function. In this study, we investigate the kinetics of the neuritogenic effect of C3d and show that by providing an adhesive substratum for neurite promotion, the peptide induces both a persistent neuritogenic response from primary hippocampal neurons and the formation of functional synapses, with synaptogenesis accelerated in cultures grown on C3dversus control (poly-l-lysine) substratum. We also show that C3d affects the presynaptic function in primary hippocampal neurons in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and this effect is dependent on the activation of FGF receptor. The C3 undecapeptide (ASKKPKRNIKA) and the control peptide C3ala, in which Lys-6 and Arg-7 were substituted with Ala, were synthesized as dendrimers composed of four monomers coupled to a lysine backbone by Prof. Arne Holm (Royal Agricultural and Veterinary University, Copenhagen, Denmark). Hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic day 19 rat embryos as described in (10Maar T.E. Rønn L.C.B. Bock E Berezin V. Moran J. Pasantes-Morales H. Schousboe A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 163-172Google Scholar). Neurons were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/cm2 in eight-well LabTek tissue culture chambers with a growth surface of Permanox plastic (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) or fibronectin (Sigma). For coating, slides were incubated with fibronectin diluted in H2O and dried overnight at room temperature in a flow bench to reach a final surface concentration of 0.01–20 ॖg/cm2. For C3d immobilization, culture chambers were preincubated with various concentrations of the peptide for 2 h at 37 °C. Before cell seeding, culture chambers were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 17 bovine serum albumin (BSA). After plating, cultures were maintained at 37 °C, 57 CO2 in Neurobasal medium containing 20 mmHEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin, and 0.47 w/v BSA (Sigma), supplemented with B27 (all from Invitrogen). For analysis of neurite outgrowth, cultures were fixed with 47 v/v formaldehyde, stained for 20 min with 0.047 w/v Coomassie Blue R 250 in 457 v/v ethanol and 457 v/v acetic acid, and subsequently analyzed employing computer-assisted microscopy as described previously (11Rønn L.C.B. Ralets I. Hartz B.P. Bech M. Berezin A. Berezin V. Moller A. Bock E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 100: 25-32Google Scholar). In each experiment, the length of neurites from 150–200 neurons was determined. The expression of NCAM was analyzed by immunoblotting. To estimate the amount of NCAM in hippocampal cells 0–30 min after trypsinization, 106 cells in suspension were collected for lysis after cell dissociation in DNase I. The cells were pelleted at 1000 × g for 2 min and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 27 v/v Triton X-100, pH 8, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors: 0.8 ॖm aprotinin, 50 ॖm bestatin, 15 ॖm E-64, 20 ॖm leupeptin, and 10 ॖm pepstatin A; set III, Calbiochem). For analysis of NCAM expression at 1-24 h after dissociation, hippocampal neurons were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes (Nunc) at a density of 40,000 cells/cm2 and maintained in culture for 1, 2, 3, 6, or 24 h. Cells were scraped off in 0.5 ml of Neurobasal growth medium, pelleted at 1000 × g for 2 min, and solubilized in lysis buffer. Cell extracts were briefly sonicated (10–15 s, 40 watts), clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and treated with Endo-N (1 ॖg/ml, recombinant MBP-fusion protein, Protein Laboratory, Institute of Molecular Pathology, Panum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) to remove the NCAM polysialylation. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described in Ref. 12Skladchikova G. Berezin V. Bock E. Neurotoxicology. 1998; 19: 357-370Google Scholar. Protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate Western Dura (Pierce) and processed with the GenTools software package (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Visualization of filamentous actin (F-actin) was performed as described in Ref. 13Walmod P.S. Skladchikova G. Kawa A. Berezin V. Bock E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 42: 241-255Google Scholar. For double immunostaining for synaptophysin and GAP43, cell cultures were fixed in 47 w/v paraformaldehyde in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 mNaH2PO4, 50 mm sucrose, 0.4 mm CaCl2, pH 7.1) for 30 min at room temperature, blocked with 107 v/v normal goat serum, 17 w/v BSA in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, and washed with 17 BSA containing 0.27 w/v saponin. For double immunostaining for the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 and NCAM, cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1 v/v) for 5 min at −20 °C and washed with 17 BSA. Neurons were subsequently incubated with the following primary antibodies diluted in buffer: antisynaptophysin mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG; diluted 1:500, Sigma) and rabbit anti-rat-GAP43 polyclonal antibodies (1:1000, prepared as described previously (14Mosevitsky M.I. Capony J.P. Skladchikova G. Novitskaya V.A. Plekhanov A. Zakharov V.V. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 373-384Google Scholar)), or anti-PSD-95 monoclonal antibody (IgG; 1:500, clone 6G6, Affinity Bioreagents, AH Diagnostics) and rabbit anti-rat-NCAM polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Protein Laboratory). Incubation with primary antibodies was performed at 4 °C overnight. Bound antibodies were detected with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Molecular Probes). Slides were mounted using Prolong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes) and scanned with a MultiProbe 2001 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with an oil immersion ×60 1.4 NA or ×100 1.4 NA objective (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). To determine the amount of C3d in culture medium at different times after addition of the peptide, 200-ॖl samples containing 1 or 10 ॖm of the peptide dissolved in Neurobasal medium, were incubated in eight-well LabTek tissue culture chamber slides at 37 °C, 57 CO2 in the absence or presence of plated hippocampal neurons. At various times (0, 1, 6, or 24 h), aliquots were collected. Mass spectroscopic determination of the amount of C3d in the samples was performed using an Esquire liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was an Esquire ion trap MS analyzer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) connected to an HP1100 system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) with a Vadyac low trifluoroacetic acid reverse phase column (21 × 150 mm). The solvent system comprised two solvents: (a) water with 0.027 v/v trifluoroacetic acid and (b) acetonitrile/water (90:10) with 0.027 trifluoroacetic acid. A gradient of B was steadily increasing from 0 to 507 over 30 min of acquisition with a flow rate of 0.250 ml/min. Angiotensin II (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland, 10 ॖm) was used as internal standard to control the volume of the injected peptide and was added to each sample to a final concentration of 1 ॖm. The total injection volume was 50 ॖl. Quantification of the C3d amount was performed by isolation of the MS signal at 1073,8 Da [M + 5H]5+ and angiotensin II at 1046.0 Da [M + H]+. The total counts for each sample were found by integration of the isolated MS signal. To quantify the rates of C3d clearance from the culture medium based on the obtained experimental data (concentrations of C3d after various times of incubation), a mathematical model was developed (see 舠舡). The model adequately described the experimentally obtained time course of C3d clearance from the culture medium and was used for estimation of rate constants of C3d degradation and sedimentation (see 舠Results舡). FM1-43 labeling of functional synapses was performed as described previously by Ryan et al. (15Ryan T.A. Reuter H. Beverly W. Schweizer F.E. Tsien R.W. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 713-724Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 daysin vitro (DIV) hippocampal neurons were incubated in the presence of 2 ॖm of the fluorescent styryl membrane probe FM1-43 (Molecular Probes) and 90 mm KCl for 60 s followed by washing 3–4 times in normal saline for 5 min each to remove surface-bound FM1-43. Normal saline contained 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mmMgSO4, 1.3 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH. After loading, a field containing labeled punctae-like areas (0.3–3 ॖm2) was chosen. Pixel intensities from each object were averaged to obtain a measure of the local fluorescence intensity in the individual presynaptic terminal. To evaluate the rate of turnover of synaptic vesicles, the synapses loaded with FM1-43 were destained by 150-s stimulation with 90 mm KCl in FM1-43-free solution. Fluorescence images of FM1-43-loaded synapses were obtained with a MultiProbe 2001 laser scanning confocal microscope, ×60 1.4 NA objective, at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Images were quantified using the ImageSpace software package (Amersham Biosciences). To evaluate the rate of FM1-43 unloading, the experimentally obtained time courses of synaptic destaining were approximated with a single exponential function, exp(−kt) where k is the rate of destaining and t is the time elapsed after the start of KCl application. Statistics and graphical presentations were carried out using the Origin version 5.0 software package (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Statistical evaluations were performed using a two-sided Student's t test. The results are given as mean ± S.E. Unless otherwise stated asterisks indicate the statistical significance: *, p< 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001 as compared with control. The induction of neurite outgrowth from hippocampal neurons by C3d takes place upon its binding to NCAM-IgI (1Rønn L.C. B Olsen M. Ostergaard S. Kiselyov V. Berezin V. Mortensen M.T. Lerche M.H. Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Saffell J.L. Doherty P. Poulsen F.M. Bock E. Holm A. Saffells J.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1000-1005Google Scholar). Thus, the amount of NCAM expressed on the cell surface at the time when C3d is added to the culture medium might be of importance for its neuritogenic activity. We therefore first analyzed the expression of the two NCAM isoforms, 180 kDa NCAM and 140 kDa NCAM, at different times after trypsinization of hippocampal cells (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡 for details). In Fig. 1, it can be seen that the amount of 180 kDa NCAM and 140 kDa NCAM was significantly less at 0–3 h as compared with 24 h in vitro. During this period, the level of expression of 180 kDa NCAM and 140 kDa NCAM amounted to ∼207 and ∼507, respectively, as compared with the level of expression at 24 h in vitro. Thus, the receptor for C3d binding, although reduced, was present even shortly after trypsinization. Treatment of hippocampal neurons with C3d for 24 h has been shown to induce a neuritogenic response with a bell-shaped dose-response relationship, the maximal activity being observed at a peptide concentration of 0.54 ॖm (1Rønn L.C. B Olsen M. Ostergaard S. Kiselyov V. Berezin V. Mortensen M.T. Lerche M.H. Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Saffell J.L. Doherty P. Poulsen F.M. Bock E. Holm A. Saffells J.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1000-1005Google Scholar). Accordingly, in our experiments, 1 ॖm C3d induced profound neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2). The time responses of neurite outgrowth induced by various doses of the peptide (0.3, 1, 3 ॖm, Fig. 3A) were very similar, with the strongest induction of neurite outgrowth being observed at 1 ॖm C3d.Figure 3The neuritogenic activity of C3d, time- and dose-response studies.

Cultures were treated with 0.3 ॖm (▪), 1 ॖm (●), 3 ॖm (▴), 10 ॖm (○), and 30 ॖm (▵) C3d for 1, 2, 4, 8, or 24 h from the time of seeding. The average neurite length was measured 24 h after seeding. Interpolating curves were derived based on five independent experiments. D, dependence of time of exposure to C3d resulting in maximal neuritogenic response on the applied concentration of C3d.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The neuritogenic effect of C3d also depended on the time of application after cell seeding and the total time of exposure to the peptide. In a first set of experiments, C3d was added at different times after cell seeding (0–24 h, Fig. 3B) and, for each time point, the average length of neurites was estimated after 24 h of exposure to the peptide. For all peptide concentrations, the amplitude of the neuritogenic response was highest if the peptide was applied 0–2 h after plating. When treatment with C3d started 24 h after seeding, no neuritogenic effect was observed (Fig. 3B), indicating that the later treatment with C3d starts after plating, the smaller was the magnitude of the neuritogenic response induced by the NCAM ligand. In a second set of experiments, hippocampal neurons were treated with C3d in various concentrations for 1, 2, 4, 8, or 24 h starting from the time of seeding (time 0), and subsequently the average neurite length was estimated at 24 h in vitro (Fig.3C). It can be seen that the maximal neuritogenic activity of C3d varied significantly depending both on exposure time and on the peptide concentration. To determine the maxima of the obtained experimental curves, sets of experimental data were interpolated with the Bezier polynomes, and the time of exposure to C3d resulting in a maximal neuritogenic response at any given concentration was plotted against the employed dose (Fig. 3D). From the graph, it can be seen that the higher the concentration of C3d, the shorter was the time of exposure resulting in a maximal neuritogenic stimulation. Taken together, these results highlight two aspects of the neuritogenic effect of C3d: 1) C3d triggering of intracellular signaling pathways may only be possible shortly after cell seeding, with a 舠time window舡 in the range of 2 h, and 2) C3d may promote neurite extension by forming an adhesive peptide substratum. In the latter case, the same 舠optimal舡 surface concentration of C3d could be achieved either by a short exposure to high concentrations of the peptide or by longer exposures to lower doses. This would explain the observation that the optimal time of exposure to C3d decreases with the rise of peptide concentration (Fig. 3D). To test the above hypothesis, hippocampal neurons were grown in culture chambers coated with C3d. The immobilized peptide strongly stimulated neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In contrast to soluble C3d, the dose-response curve for immobilized peptide did not demonstrate a decrease at high peptide concentrations, reaching instead a plateau at [C3d] = 3 ॖm, probably due to a saturation of the binding sites on the plastic surface at this concentration (Fig.4A). Moreover, addition of soluble C3d to cultures of hippocampal cells inhibited neurite outgrowth induced by immobilized C3d (not shown). These results indicated that at high C3d concentrations, the soluble peptide presumably interfered with cell-substrate adhesion, thus preventing neurite promotion. If this was the case, one might expect that readdition of the peptide to the culture medium would competitively inhibit C3d-induced neurite outgrowth. Indeed, treatment of hippocampal neurons twice with C3d at times 0 and 24 h led to a marked decrease of the neuritogenic response when estimated at 48 h. The effect was even more pronounced when C3d was applied at times 0, 24, and 48 h, and the response was measured at 72 h as compared with control cultures treated with C3d only once, at the time of seeding (Fig.4B). To test whether the observed effect was C3d-specific, we plated hippocampal neurons onto a fibronectin substratum (0.02–20 ॖg/cm2) and treated them with 1 ॖm C3d at time 0 or at times 0 and 24 h. The average length of neurites was measured after 48 h. Cultures grown on fibronectin, but not treated with C3d, were used as controls. From Fig. 4C, it can be seen that fibronectin stimulates neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner with a threshold of 0.05 ॖg/cm2. C3d added at time 0 induced an additional neuritogenic effect over that exerted by fibronectin. A second application of the C3d (24 h) abolished the neuritogenesis induced by the peptide without affecting the rate of fibronectin-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4C). Thus, repetitive treatment with C3d specifically modulated C3d-, but not fibronectin-induced, neurite outgrowth. These results indicate that C3d induces the neuritogenic response not only by triggering intracellular signaling pathways but also by forming an adhesive substratum and subsequent interaction with NCAM expressed on the plasma membrane. Soluble C3d might competitively disrupt this interaction, resulting in a significant decrease of the neuritogenic response. To directly confirm the above hypothesis, we investigated the time course of the C3d concentration in culture medium with and without hippocampal cells using mass spectroscopy. The time courses of the peptide concentration in the medium, [C3d]f, normalized to the corresponding initial values (1 and 10 ॖm), represented biphasic curves with a fast initial [C3d]f fall at 0–6 h of the incubation followed by a slower decrease at 6–24 h (Fig. 5). The rate of C3d clearance from the culture medium in the absence of cells was higher for 1 ॖm than for 10 ॖm C3d. This indicated that at least two mechanisms with different time scales contributed to the [C3d]f decrease in the culture medium over time. We presumed that the process of fast initial (0–2 h) C3d clearance from the culture medium reflected the adsorption of the peptide to the plastic surface since the slower disappearance of 10 ॖm rather than 1 ॖm C3d at short times suggested the presence of a saturating clearance process, which would not be the case if the peptide simply was degraded in the medium. At longer (6–24 h) times, a slower clearance was observed, which probably reflected C3d degradation. To estimate the rates of these processes, we constructed a mathematical model comprising both mechanisms (see 舠舡). The model adequately described the experimental data (Fig. 5, solid curves), allowing us to estimate time constants of C3d degradation (τ1) and sedimentation (τ2), which were found to be τ1 = 50 h for both peptide doses and τ2 = 5.2 h for 1 ॖm C3d or τ2 = 0.4 h for 10 ॖm C3d (see 舠舡 for details). In the presence of hippocampal neurons, 1 ॖm C3d was cleared from the culture medium significantly faster (Fig. 5). However, the time course of the C3d clearance could not be approximated by the biexponential curve since the peptide was degraded faster during the first hours in culture than at 6–24 h. This indicated that C3d was also cleaved by the cells, the rate of cell-induced C3d degradation decreasing by time in culture. This might be due to the binding of C3d to the cell receptors (NCAM) followed by cleavage of the peptide by cell proteases or shedding and/or endocytosis of NCAM together with the bound peptide at short times after cell dissociation. Since C3d peptide induced persistent neurite outgrowth terminating in the formation of a neuronal network approximately at day 5 in vitro, it seemed important to elucidate how rapidly the induced neuritogenic response resulted in formation of functional synapses. This process has been shown to correlate strongly with the acquisition of focal accumulations of synaptic vesicle proteins such as synaptophysin (17Fletcher T.L. Cameron P. De Camilli P. Banker G. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1617-1626Google Scholar). Thus, synaptophysin-positive spots provide an accurate quantifiable estimate of presynaptic terminals (18Hiscock J.J. Murphy S. Willoughby J.O. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 95: 1-11Google Scholar). We investigated the time course of expression of synaptophysin in primary hippocampal neurons plated onto substrata consisting of C3d, the Ig2 module of NCAM, or poly-l-lysin (PLL). Spontaneous neuritogenesis on PLL was used as a control. Cells were immunostained for synaptophysin after 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 days in culture. Fig.6 shows double immunostaining for the neuronal membrane protein GAP43 and the presynaptic marker, synaptophysin, of neurons grown either on C3d (A, C) or PLL (B, D) substratum at 5 (A, B) and 8 (C, D) days in vitro. At 5 DIV, cells grown on the two substrata had similar morphology (Fig. 6,A and B). However, punctate patches of synaptophysin immunoreactivity on cell bodies and dendrites were more numerous in cultures grown on C3d than on control substratum (compare Fig. 6, A and B). At 8 DIV, no difference was seen (compare Fig. 6, C and D). To obtain a quantitative estimate of the rate of synapse formation, we evaluated the number of synaptophysin-positive spots/unit of neurite length in the cultures, grown on the two substrates. From Fig.7A, it can be seen that hippocampal neurons cultivated on either C3d or the NCAM-Ig2 module developed synapses significantly faster than cells cultivated on PLL. The difference in the number of formed synapses was considerable at 3–6 DIV but disappeared by 8 DIV (Fig. 7A). The time course of expression of the postsynaptic density marker PSD-95 in cultures grown on C3d was similar to that of synaptophysin with a punctate PSD-95 immunoreactivity appearing at approximately 5 DIV (not shown). The observed effect could not be attributed to the enhanced encounter rate between neurites in C3d- versus PLL-stimulated cells since at any time in vitro, the average neurite length in cultures grown on PLL somewhat exceeded that in cultures grown on C3d or Ig2 (Fig. 7B). Thus, both the natural NCAM ligand, NCAM-Ig2, and the peptide mimetic C3d promoted synapse formation in primary hippocampal neurons.Figure 7Quantification of the time course of synaptophysin expression (A) and neurite outgrowth (B) in primary hippocampal neurons grown on poly-l-lysin (■), Ig2-NCAM (●), or C3d (▪) substrata.

https://openalex.org/W2071913196,"Steroid hormone biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex is controlled by adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), which increases intracellular cAMP, resulting in the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase(PKA) and subsequent increase in steroidogenic gene transcription. We have found that a dual-specificity phosphatase is essential for conveying ACTH/cAMP-stimulated transcription of several steroidogenic genes in the human adrenal cortex. In the present study, the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), a nuclear dual-specificity phosphatase, in the transcriptional activation of human CYP17 (hCYP17) in H295R human adrenocortical cells is established. Stimulation of H295R cells with dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP) induces MKP-1 mRNA and protein expression within 30 min of exposure. In transient-transfection studies, transcriptional activity of an hCYP17 promoter-reporter construct was increased by Bt2cAMP and by overexpression of PKA or MKP-1. Furthermore, PKA phosphorylated an MKP-1-glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in in vitroassays and Bt2cAMP increased 32P associated with MKP-1 that was immunoprecipitated from H295R cells. Finally, silencing MKP-1 expression using antisense oligonucleotides attenuated cAMP-stimulated hCYP17 expression, whereas silencing of ERK1/2 increased hCYP17 expression. These findings demonstrate integral roles for MKP-1 and ERK1/2 via regulation of the phosphorylation state of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) in mediating ACTH/cAMP-dependent transcription of hCYP17, thereby maintaining the balance between transcriptional activation and repression. Steroid hormone biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex is controlled by adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), which increases intracellular cAMP, resulting in the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase(PKA) and subsequent increase in steroidogenic gene transcription. We have found that a dual-specificity phosphatase is essential for conveying ACTH/cAMP-stimulated transcription of several steroidogenic genes in the human adrenal cortex. In the present study, the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), a nuclear dual-specificity phosphatase, in the transcriptional activation of human CYP17 (hCYP17) in H295R human adrenocortical cells is established. Stimulation of H295R cells with dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP) induces MKP-1 mRNA and protein expression within 30 min of exposure. In transient-transfection studies, transcriptional activity of an hCYP17 promoter-reporter construct was increased by Bt2cAMP and by overexpression of PKA or MKP-1. Furthermore, PKA phosphorylated an MKP-1-glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in in vitroassays and Bt2cAMP increased 32P associated with MKP-1 that was immunoprecipitated from H295R cells. Finally, silencing MKP-1 expression using antisense oligonucleotides attenuated cAMP-stimulated hCYP17 expression, whereas silencing of ERK1/2 increased hCYP17 expression. These findings demonstrate integral roles for MKP-1 and ERK1/2 via regulation of the phosphorylation state of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) in mediating ACTH/cAMP-dependent transcription of hCYP17, thereby maintaining the balance between transcriptional activation and repression. adrenocorticotropin cAMP-dependent protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 dibutyryl-cAMP human CYP17 dual-specificity phosphatase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase cycloheximide okadaic acid endothall dephostatin cyclosporine A peroxyvanadate phosphate-buffered saline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase The role of ACTH1 is to assure that optimal steroidogenic capacity is maintained in the adrenal cortex. This is achieved, via the actions of cAMP, by maintaining transcriptional pressure on the genes encoding the steroid hydroxylases (CYPs) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (1Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R.

JAI Press, Inc., Greenwich, CT1996: 81-102Google Scholar). cAMP activates PKA, ultimately leading to increased gene transcription via the binding of various transcription factors to cAMP-responsive sequences that lie within the promoters of steroidogenic genes (1Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2001; 2: 269-274Google Scholar, 3Bird I.M. Mason J.I. Rainey W.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1592-1597Google Scholar, 4Waterman M.R. Bischof L.J.

The direct target of PKA has yet to be determined; however, we have demonstrated that the cAMP-stimulated gene expression of multiple steroidogenic genes in the human adrenal cortex is mediated by phosphatase activity (10Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Google Scholar, 11Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 163-174Google Scholar). Using various selective inhibitors of either serine/threonine or tyrosine phosphatase activities, we found that the mRNA levels of both mitochondrial and microsomal steroidogenic gene products depend on the activity of a dual-specificity phosphatase (DSP) (10Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Google Scholar, 11Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 163-174Google Scholar). cAMP stimulation of H295R cells resulted in the dephosphorylation of SF-1, as measured by immunoprecipitation of SF-1 after in vivolabeling with [32P]orthophosphate (10Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway mimicked cAMP-dependent transcriptional activation of hCYP17 expression in H295R cells, indicating a role for a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in regulating transcription of steroidogenic genes in the adrenal cortex (10Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings lead us to postulate that the target of PKA is a DSP, which leads to the dephosphorylation of SF-1. MAPKs are regulated through reversible phosphorylation, where activation is catalyzed by their cognate dual-specificity MAPK kinases (e.g. MEK), and inactivation is primarily achieved by a group of MKPs (12Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Google Scholar). Ten MKPs have been identified (13Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 1999; 14: 6-16Google Scholar, 14Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H.

Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Google Scholar, 11Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. J. Mol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 659-668Google Scholar), we hypothesized that a DSP, via dephosphorylation of SF-1, played an integral role in cAMP-dependent hCYP17 gene expression. Thus, we characterized the effect of cAMP stimulation on MKP-1 expression and the role of MKP-1 in activating hCYP17 gene expression. We show that MKP-1 mRNA and protein levels are induced by Bt2cAMP and that overexpression of MKP-1 stimulates hCYP17 reporter gene activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that PKA phosphorylates MKP-1. Finally, using antisense technology to suppress MKP-1 and ERK1/2 expression, we show that MKP-1 is essential for ACTH/cAMP-dependent hCYP17 expression, whereas silencing ERK1/2 expression increased basal hCYP17 mRNA levels, suggesting an essential role for ERK1/2 in maintaining low constitutive hCYP17 expression. Our studies demonstrate a central role for the MKP-1/ERK1/2 system in conveying ACTH/cAMP-dependent transcriptional activation of steroidogenic gene expression via dephosphorylation/phosphorylation of SF-1. Bt2cAMP, cycloheximide (CHX), and hydrogen peroxide were obtained from Sigma. Okadaic acid (OA), PD98059, endothall (ETL), bpv(phen), dephostatin (DPN), cyclosporine A (CyA), and sodium orthovanadate were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Peroxyvanadate (PV) was prepared by mixing equal concentrations (12 mm) of H2O2 with sodium orthovanadate prior to treatment. OA and ETL are inhibitors of the serine/threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, CyA inhibits serine/threonine phosphatase PP2B (calcineurin) and PV, bpv(phen) and DPN inhibit phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity. PD98059 inhibits MEK activity. H295R adrenocortical cells (25Rainey W.E. Bird I.M. Mason J.I. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 99: R17-R20Google Scholar, 26Staels B. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 423-433Google Scholar) were generously donated by Dr. William E. Rainey (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% Nu-Serum I (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA), 0.5% ITS Plus (BD Biosciences, and antibiotics. Cells were subcultured onto 12-well plates and 24 h later transfected with a hCYP17 57-pGL3 reporter plasmid (27Sewer M.B. Nguyen V. Huang C.-J. Tucker P.W. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1280-1290Google Scholar). The hCYP17 57-pGL3 construct was generated by ligating double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the region −57/−2 of the hCYP17 5′ flank upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The expression vector for SF-1 was generously provided by Dr. K. Morohashi (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan) and the expression plasmid for MKP-1 by Dr. J. Dixon (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Reporter (250 ng) and expression (100 ng) plasmids were transfected into H295R cells using the Effectene nonliposomal lipid transfection reagent (Qiagen) for 24 h. Cells were then treated with Bt2cAMP in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors for periods ranging from 6 to 12 h. Phosphatase inhibitors were administered at the following concentrations: 25 nm OA, 100 μm ETL, 25 μm PV, 20 μm DPN, and 500 nm CyA. Cells were harvested and cellular extracts prepared for luciferase assays (Promega), and protein concentration was determined (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Data obtained from luciferase assays (relative luciferase light units) were normalized to Renilla (pRL, Promega) luciferase activity of each sample. Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides (28Kiemer A.K. Weber N.C. Furst R. Bildner N. Kulhanek-Heinze S. Vollmar A.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 90: 874-881Google Scholar, 29Monia B.P. Johnston J.F.

H295R cells were transfected with MKP-1 antisense (G*G*A*ACTCAG TGGAACTC*A*G*G) or scrambled negative control (A*G*G*TCCTGA AAGCGAAG*T*C*G) oligonucleotides, as previously described (33Duff J.L. Monia B.P. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7161-7166Google Scholar). For ERK gene silencing, cells were transfected with ERK antisense (A*T*G*GCGGCGGCGGCGGCG*G*C*T) or ERK negative-control (G*C*A*CAGCCGCCTGCCGCC*G*C*C) oligonucleotides (34Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Google Scholar). The asterisks denote locations of phosphorothioate modifications. MKP-1 oligonucleotides were added to the cells at concentrations of 0.3, 1, or 3 μm, and ERK1/2 oligonucleotides were added to cells at 1 μm using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). After 6 h, the medium was removed and cells were treated for 1 h (for maximal MKP-1 induction) or 12 h (maximal hCYP17 induction) with 1 mm Bt2cAMP. Cells were harvested and total RNA was prepared from treated cells by acid-phenol extraction (TRIzol, Invitrogen). RNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm. For Northern blot assays (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), RNA (10 μg) was fractionated by agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis in the presence of 5% formaldehyde and transferred to nylon transfer membrane filters (HybondTM-N+, AmershamBiosciences). A 500-bp cDNA fragment obtained by digestion of MKP-1pCMV5 with PstI was used to detect MKP-1 mRNA expression. A 1.2-kb hCYP17 cDNA fragment was used to detect hCYP17 mRNA expression. Results were normalized to the content of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) mRNA. cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by random primer labeling (Prime It II, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in a 2× sodium citrate-sodium chloride (SSC) solution containing 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 100 μg/ml denatured single-stranded salmon sperm DNA, and 32P-labeled cDNA probes. The hybridized membranes were sequentially washed for 2 × 10 min in 2x SSC, 0.2% SDS, and 2 × 5 min in 0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 42 °C. The amount of probe bound to the filter was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. H295R nuclear extracts (10 μg protein/lane) were harvested from cells treated with 1 mmBt2cAMP for periods ranging from 30 min to 4 h, subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%), and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out using anti-MKP-1 (1:5000 dilution) or anti-ERK2 (1:10,000 dilution) obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein expression was detected by the ECL+ Western blot detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) using a protein G-peroxidase-conjugated protein (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). For in vivo labeling, H295R cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes. The media was changed to either phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 0.5 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or cysteine- and methione-free media containing 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (Redivue™in vitro cell labeling mix; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were metabolically labeled for 4 h followed by stimulation with 1 mm Bt2cAMP for 2 h prior to harvest. Radiolabeled cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts isolated as described above. For immunoprecipitation assays, nuclear proteins were incubated with anti-MKP-1 antiserum and protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The mixture was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. Beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), twice with PBS, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Gels were stained with Coomassie blue, dried, and subjected to audioradiography to detect 32P- or35S-labeled proteins. MKP-1 was PCR-amplified using a 5′ primer containing a BamH1 site linked to the first codon of MKP-1 and a 3′ primer containing a HindIII site. TheBamH1-HindIII digest of the PCR products were cloned into BamH1-HindIII-digested pET42b(+) (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI). For preparation of GST fusion proteins inEschirichiacoli, 5 ml of overnight cultures were diluted 100 times, induced with 1 mmisopropyl-γ-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and grown further for 20 h. Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in 20 ml of PBS containing 50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The bacteria were incubated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 15 min on ice, and the cells were disrupted using a sonicator. The suspension was centrifuged (39,000 × g) for 25 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 500 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Novagen) for 30 min at 25 °C. The beads were then washed three times with PBS and suspended in 250 μl of PBS containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. For in vitro phosphorylation assays, 40 μl of a 50% slurry of MKP-1/GST-glutathione-agarose beads were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μCi γ [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 5 units of PKA catalytic subunit (from bovine heart; Calbiochem). The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA (2 mm final concentration). The beads were then washed three times with PBS and resuspended in SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer for SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Gels were stained with Coomassie blue, dried, and subjected to audioradiography to detect32P-labeled protein. Data from transfection assays were expressed as the percentage of the mean of the control group in each experiment. One-way analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls test were used to determine differences among treatment groups. Asterisks denote significant difference from control, p < 0.05. Agents that increase intracellular cAMP have been found to induce the mRNA expression of MKP-1 in PC12 cells (18Burgun C. Esteve L. Humblot N. Aunis D. Zwiller J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 189-193Google Scholar). Moreover, we have previously shown that both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatase activities are required for cAMP-dependent gene expression of steroidogenic genes in the human adrenal cortex (10Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Google Scholar, 11Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 163-174Google Scholar). Thus, we first examined whether the DSP MKP-1 was expressed in H295R cells and was responsive to Bt2cAMP. Cells were treated with 1 mm Bt2cAMP for 30 min to 4 h and harvested for analysis of MKP-1 mRNA expression. As shown in Fig.1 A, MKP-1 mRNA expression was significantly induced by cAMP within 30 min. This induction was maximal after 1 h and decreased by 4 h (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, unlike the cAMP-dependent mRNA expression of steroidogenic genes, which is CHX-sensitive (3Bird I.M. Mason J.I. Rainey W.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1592-1597Google Scholar, 26Staels B. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 423-433Google Scholar, 37Zuber M.X. John M.E. Okamura T. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2475-2485Google Scholar, 38Waterman M.R. Simpson E.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1989; 45: 533-563Google Scholar), the induction of MKP-1 mRNA by cAMP was not attenuated by CHX (Fig.1 B). MKP-1 protein expression levels were also measured over the same time course (Fig. 1 C). An increase in MKP-1 protein expression was observed within 30 min, was maximal after 2 h, and began to decline after 4 h of exposure to Bt2cAMP (Fig. 1 C). To determine the effect of MKP-1 on the transcriptional activity of hCYP17, we performed transient-transfection assays. H295R cells were transfected with hCYP17 57-pGL3, PKA-pCMV, and MKP-1-pCMV. As shown in Fig. 2 administration of 1 mmBt2cAMP significantly increased transcriptional activity of hCYP17-pGL3. Co-expression of either PKA or MKP-1 also significantly increased transcriptional activity of the hCYP17 57-bp construct (Fig.2), indicating that MKP-1 mimics cAMP/PKA-stimulated transcription of hCYP17 reporter gene expression. Once we established that cAMP induces MKP-1 mRNA and protein levels, we next wanted to determine whether PKA can directly phosphorylate MKP-1 in vitro. An MKP-1-GST fusion protein was prepared and incubated with the catalytic subunit of PKA and [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig.3 A, MKP-1 can be directly phosphorylated by PKA. Moreover, stimulation of metabolically labeled cells with Bt2cAMP results in increased MKP-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). These findings suggest that MKP-1 is a direct target of PKA in the human adrenal cortex, however, further studies aimed at mapping the phosphorylation sites of MKP-1 after cAMP stimulation are necessary to establish for certain that the action of PKA on MKP-1 is direct. SF-1 is essential for increased steroidogenic gene expression. Previous studies have shown that both basal and cAMP-dependent hCYP17 transcriptional activity is dependent on complex formation of SF-1, p54nrb, and PSF (27Sewer M.B. Nguyen V. Huang C.-J. Tucker P.W. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1280-1290Google Scholar). Moreover, SF-1 was found to be dephosphorylated in response to cAMP stimulation (10Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Google Scholar). To further characterize the role of phosphatase activity in SF-1-mediated steroidogenic gene transcription, H295R cells were transfected with the hCYP17-pGL3 reporter construct and a SF-1 expression plasmid. Cells were treated for 12 h with OA, ETL, PV, bpv(phen), DPN, or CyA and harvested for luciferase activity assays. As shown in Fig. 4, SF-1 significantly increased the transcriptional activity of the hCYP17 57-bp construct. Administration of both serine-threonine (OA, ETL) and phosphotyrosine (PV, bpv(phen), DPN) phosphatase inhibitors completely attenuated SF-1-mediated transcriptional activity. OA and ETL significantly reduced SF-1-mediated transcriptional activity of the hCYP17 57-pGL3 construct below basal levels. CyA, a PP2B (calcineurin) inhibitor, had no significant effect on SF-1-mediated luciferase activity. Thus far, the data presented in this paper demonstrate that the synthesis of MKP-1 is stimulated by cAMP in H295R cells and is an in vitro target for PKA. However, these findings provide only indirect evidence for its role in hCYP17 transcription. To determine whether MKP-1 is the phosphatase essential for ACTH/cAMP-dependent hCYP17 expression in vivo, we used antisense oligonucleotides to block MKP-1 expression in H295R cells. The oligonucleotides were made as phosphorothioate derivatives, which have been shown to enhance nuclease resistance and support RNase H cleavage of hybridizing RNA (31Stein C.A. Cohen J.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2659-2668Google Scholar, 32Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Zounes M.A. Freier S.M. Lima W.F. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18162-18171Google Scholar). Sequences used have been previously described (33Duff J.L. Monia B.P. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7161-7166Google Scholar). H295R cells were incubated for 6 h with oligonucleotides at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 3 μm in serum-free media containing the nonliposomal lipid transfection Effectene. After oligonucleotide uptake, cells were stimulated for 1 h or 12 h with Bt2cAMP, and Northern blot analysis was performed to measure the steady-state levels of endogenous MKP-1 and hCYP17 mRNA. As shown in Fig.5 A, 1 μm MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide completely abolished cAMP-stimulated MKP-1 mRNA expression. Maximal induction of MKP-1 mRNA and protein expression occurred after 1 h and 2 h of cAMP stimulation, respectively (Fig. 1, A and C). To determine whether this immediate rise in MKP-1 expression is consistent with the time course of cAMP-stimulated hCYP17 mRNA expression, the effect of Bt2cAMP on hCYP17 mRNA expression over time was measured. As shown in Fig. 5 B, cAMP increases hCYP17 mRNA expression within 4 h, and this increase is maximal after 12 h. Taken together with the time course of MKP-1 induction by cAMP (Fig. 1, A and C), these data suggest that MKP-1 plays a direct role in cAMP-dependent hCYP17 expression. However, these findings do not rule out the possibility that another protein(s) may also play intermediary roles in cAMP-stimulated hCYP17 expression. MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotides were also used to determine the effect of MKP-1 suppression on cAMP-stimulated hCYP17 mRNA expression. H295R cells were transfected with the oligoncleotides and stimulated with 1 mm Bt2cAMP for 12 h. The 12 h time point was chosen because it is the point at which cAMP maximally increases hCYP17 mRNA levels (Fig. 5 B). When the transfected cells were incubated with Bt2cAMP for 12 h, cAMP failed to increase hCYP17 mRNA (Fig. 5, C andD). In contrast, the scrambled negative control oligonucleotide had no effect on cAMP-stimulated MKP-1 and hCYP17 mRNA expression (Fig. 5, A and C). We have previously found that inhibiting ERK1/2 activation using the MEK inhibitor PD98059 induces hCYP17 mRNA expression (10Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we postulated that activation of ERK1/2 results in constitutive phosphorylation of SF-1 and subsequent decreased hCYP17 expression. To determine whether ERK1/2 plays a role in maintaining low basal hCYP17 levels, we used antisense oligonucleotides to suppress ERK1/2 RNA expression. H295R cells were transfected with either antisense oligonucleotides or a scrambled negative control oligonucleotide for 24 h and harvested for RNA analysis by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig.6 A, suppression of ERK1/2 increases basal hCYP17 mRNA expression, with no significant effect with the ERK1/2 scrambled negative control oligonucleotide. Western blotting for ERK2 confirmed that the antisense oligonucleotides effectively targeted and decreased ERK1/2 in the H295R cells (Fig.6 B). ACTH exerts its stimulatory action on steroid hormone biosynthesis by evoking both a rapid, acute response and a long-term, chronic response, each regulated by PKA. During the acute response, an essential site of phosphorylation by PKA is cholesterol ester hydrolase, activating the conversion of cholesterol esters to free cholesterol (39Jefcoate C.R. McNamara B.C. Artemenko I. Yamazaki T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 751-767Google Scholar). In our studies of the mechanism of chronic ACTH-dependent steroiodogenesis in the human adrenal cortex (H295R cells), we have demonstrated that cAMP-inducible binding of a SF-1, p54nrb, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) complex to the cAMP-responsive sequence of the hCYP17 promoter occurs via changes in the phosphorylation state of the orphan nuclear receptor, SF-1 (27Sewer M.B. Nguyen V. Huang C.-J. Tucker P.W. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1280-1290Google Scholar). cAMP stimulation of H295R cells led to the dephosphorylation of SF-1, as measured by immunoprecipitation of SF-1 after in vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate (10Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibiting ERK1/2 activation by treatment with PD98059 mimicked the stimulatory effects of cAMP on endogenous hCYP17 mRNA expression and on hCYP17 promoter-reporter gene activity (10Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Google Scholar), indicating a role for the MAP kinase pathway in conveying constitutive transcription of steroidogenic genes in the adrenal cortex. In the present study, we have clearly demonstrated that MKP-1 is the essential phosphatase in regulating hCYP17 in human adrenal cortex. Cross-talk between the MAPK and ACTH/cAMP pathways has been described in human adrenal cortex by our laboratory (10Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1769-1777Google Scholar, 11Sewer M.B. Waterman M.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 163-174Google Scholar) and by others (23Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.-G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Google Scholar,24Houslay M.D. Kolch W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 659-668Google Scholar). We demonstrate that MKP-1 mRNA and protein levels are rapidly induced by Bt2cAMP in H295R cells and that overexpression of MKP-1 stimulates reporter gene activity driven by the hCYP17 CRS. This increase in MKP-1 expression precedes increases in hCYP17 mRNA expression, temporally confirming the role of MKP-1 in the cAMP-dependent transcription of hCYP17. However, it is possible that another unidentified intermediary protein(s) are involved in the pathway between PKA and increased hCYP17 gene expression. As shown in Fig. 3, PKA phosphorylates MKP-1 in vitro and that in vivo Bt2cAMP treatment enhances phosphorylation of MKP-1, suggesting that PKA-dependent activation of MKP-1 stimulates the ability of this protein to dephosphorylate SF-1. Based on the data presented, we cannot conclude that the amino acid residue(s) targeted by PKA in vitro are the same as those phosphorylated after stimulating the cells with Bt2cAMP. Studies are now underway to compare the phosphorylation sites of in vitro-phosphorylated MKP-1 and MKP-1 that has been immunoprecipitated from H295R cells exposed to Bt2cAMP. If phosphorylation sites are the same, it will indicate that PKA directly targets MKP-1. Our present finding of the central role of MKP-1 in hCYP17 gene expression has also warranted future study on the role of this DSP in the regulation of other steroidogenic genes. Recently it was found that phosphorylation of SF-1 at serine 203 enhances its stability and transcriptional activity (40Desclozeaux M.K.I. Horn F. Fletterick R.J. Ingraham H.A,. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7193-7203Google Scholar). It was also shown that the levels of phosphorylated SF-1 (as detected by the use of a phosphoserine 203 SF-1 antibody) decrease when MKP-1 is overexpressed in Y1 cells (40Desclozeaux M.K.I. Horn F. Fletterick R.J. Ingraham H.A,. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7193-7203Google Scholar), indicating that serine 203 may be a direct target for MKP-1. These findings showing MKP-1-stimulated decreased phosphorylation of SF-1 are in agreement with our present data demonstrating that cAMP induces MKP-1 expression and our previous data showing that cAMP stimulation results in decreased levels of phosphorylated SF-1. However, the role that phosphorylated serine 203 SF-1 plays in ACTH/cAMP-dependent transcription of a steoroidogenic gene is unclear because we have found no effect of mutating serine 203 to alanine on the transactivation activity of SF-1 in H295R cells. 2M. B. Sewer and M. R. Waterman, unpublished observations. Our data (10, 11, 27, herein) leads to a proposed mechanism by which ACTH regulates hCYP17 transcription in human adrenal cortex that involves activation of adenylyl cyclase, elevation of cAMP levels, and subsequent activation of PKA. There are two possible mechanisms by which PKA may act to stimulate dephosphorylation of SF-1: 1) activation of MKP-1 and/or 2) inhibition of ERK1/2. Activation of MKP-1 can result in dephosphorylation of SF-1 directly by MKP-1 and also by MKP-1 inactivating ERK1/2. It is well established that DSPs directly inactivate MAP kinases (41Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Google Scholar, 42Slack D.N. Seternes O.-M. Gabrielsen M. Keyse S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16491-16500Google Scholar, 43Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1788-1793Google Scholar, 44Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Google Scholar), and, based on the studies presented, we speculate that SF-1 may be a direct target of MKP-1. In addition to MKP-1 inactivating ERK1/2, it is possible that PKA may inhibit ERK1/2. Studies in fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells have demonstrated that PKA inhibits Raf-1 activity, thus inactivating the ERK1/2 pathway (24Houslay M.D. Kolch W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 659-668Google Scholar). This inactivation has been mapped to PKA phosphorylation of Raf-1 kinase on serine 259 (45Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Google Scholar). Other studies have found that cAMP stimulates ERK1/2, via B-raf activation in several cell types, including preadipocytes, neuronal cells, ovarian granulose cells, and pituitary cells (24Houslay M.D. Kolch W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 659-668Google Scholar). Raf-1 and B-raf are upstream kinases in the ERK1/2 pathway. Collectively, these studies show that the effect of PKA on ERK1/2 is cell-type-specific and consequently detailed examination of the effect of PKA on the activation state of ERK1/2 in H295R cells is needed. The coordinated activation/repression of hCYP17 expression is mediated via dephosphorylation (MKP-1)/phosphorylation (ERK1/2), suggesting that direct targets of PKA in human adrenal steroidogenesis are MKP-1 and a member of the ERK1/2 cascade. Elevated ACTH levels shift this steroidogenic ying-yang mechanism in favor of increased steroid hormone production and a decline in ACTH levels has the opposite effect. One feature of the chronic response of steroidogenesis to ACTH/cAMP that we revealed 20 years ago and has remained unexplained is that the transcriptional activation of steroidogenic genes by ACTH (cAMP) can be inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX (46John M.E. John M.C. Boggaram V. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4715-4719Google Scholar). The rapid increase in activation of the immediate early gene MKP-1, resistance of this process to CHX, and the rapid translation of this mRNA (Fig.1) suggest that translation of MKP-1 is the CHX-sensitive event required for enhancement of hCYP17 transcription. Whether MKP-1 is the CHX-sensitive factor essential for ACTH/cAMP-dependent transcription of other steroidogenic genes awaits further study."

These proteins may interfere with intercellular lipid signaling to manipulate the defense reactions of the host or acquire essential lipids for the parasites.

Each protein produced a characteristic shift in peak fluorescence emission of DAUDA, and one (Ce-FAR-5) produced a shift greater than has been observed previously for any lipid-binding protein. Selected Ce-FAR proteins were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry, were found to be helix-rich, and exhibited high thermal stability (transition midpoint, 82.7 °C). CD and secondary structure predictions, however, both indicated that Ce-FAR-7 possesses substantially less helix than the other FAR proteins. The genes encoding the Ce-FAR proteins were found to be transcribed differentially through the life cycle of C. elegans, such that Ce-far-4 was transcribed at highest levels in the fourth larval stage, and Ce-far-3 and -7 predominated in males.

Lipid-binding proteins released by nematode parasites have attracted increasing interest because of their potential role in nutrient acquisition, manipulation of the tissues they occupy, and countering host defense reactions (1Kennedy M.W. Kennedy M.W. Harnett W. Parasitic Nematodes: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Immunology. CABI Publishing, Wallingford and New York2001: 309-330Google Scholar, 2Kennedy M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 149-164Google Scholar, 3Bradley J.E. Nirmalan N. Kläger S.L. Faulkner H. Kennedy M.W. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 471-475Google Scholar). Nematodes produce two different types of small retinol- and fatty acid-binding proteins (∼14–20 kDa), neither of which have recognizable counterparts in other animal groups, including mammals. Both are helix-rich, in contrast to the β-rich small lipid transporter proteins of vertebrates such as the lipocalins (which are extracellular and secreted) (4Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Google Scholar) and members of the FABP/P2/CRBP/CRABP1 family (which are cytoplasmic lipid transporters, with exceptions only from nematodes) (5Mei B. Kennedy M.W. Beauchamp J. Komuniecki P.R. Komuniecki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9933-9941Google Scholar, 6Storch J. Thumser A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 28-44Google Scholar). One of these two families of helix-rich lipid-binding proteins of nematodes is synthesized as a large polyprotein that is post-translationally cleaved into multiple copies of the functional protein of ∼14 kDa (2Kennedy M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 149-164Google Scholar, 7Kennedy M.W. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 373-380Google Scholar). The other family comprises the FAR proteins (fatty acid andretinol binding), which are the subjects of this report. The nematode FAR proteins were originally identified in parasitic species; Ov-FAR-1 (originally named Ov20) is secreted byOnchocerca volvulus, the causative agent of river blindness (8Tree T.I. Gillespie A.J. Shepley K.J. Blaxter M.L. Tuan R.S. Bradley J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 185-195Google Scholar). Gp-FAR-1 is associated with the surface of the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida and is thought to interfere with plant lipid-based defense signaling reactions (9Prior A. Jones J.T. Blok V.C. Beauchamp J. McDermott L. Cooper A. Kennedy M.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 387-394Google Scholar). Ov-FAR-1 binds both fatty acids and retinol (10Kennedy M.W. Garside L.H. Goodrick L.E. McDermott L. Brass A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Bradley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29442-29448Google Scholar), and it was the latter activity that drew particular attention, for three reasons. First, retinol is known to play an important role in gene activation, cell signaling, and tissue differentiation and repair (11Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1994: 443-520Google Scholar). The localized depletion of this vitamin by Ov-FAR-1 secreted by the parasite could therefore be a contributing factor to the severe eye and skin damage associated with the infection (3Bradley J.E. Nirmalan N. Kläger S.L. Faulkner H. Kennedy M.W. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 471-475Google Scholar, 12Bradley J.E. Kennedy M.W. Retinoids. 1999; 15: 11-14Google Scholar, 13Garofalo A. Kennedy M.W. Bradley J.E. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Second, there is evidence that parasitic nematodes may require retinol for their proper development and reproduction (14Storey D.M. Z. Parasitenkd. 1982; 67: 309-315Google Scholar, 15Comley J.C. Jaffe J.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 367-376Google Scholar, 16Zahner H. Sani B.P. Shealy Y.F. Nitschmann A. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1989; 40: 322-326Google Scholar, 17Lok J.B. Morris R.A. Sani B.P.

Parasitol. 1995; 80: 282-290Google Scholar), and secreted FAR proteins such as Ov-FAR-1 could be essential for the acquisition of this resource by the parasite. Third, retinol deficiency can alter the character of the host immune response (19Semba R.D. Muhilal Ward B.J. Griffin D.E. Scott A.L. Natadisastra G. West Jr., K.P. Sommer A. Lancet. 1993; 341: 5-8Google Scholar, 20Cantorna M.T. Nashold F.E. Hayes C.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1515-1522Google Scholar, 21Cantorna M.T. Nashold F.E. Chun T.Y. Hayes C.E. J.

Bucy R.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4495-4503Google Scholar), and it is possible that such changes could be beneficial to the parasite (24Carman J.A. Pond L. Nashold F. Wassom D.L. Hayes C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1111-1120Google Scholar, 25Nikawa T. Odahara K. Koizumi H. Kido Y. Teshima S. Rokutan K. Kishi K. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 934-941Google Scholar). Genes encoding FAR proteins have now been described from many species of parasitic nematode (8Tree T.I. Gillespie A.J. Shepley K.J. Blaxter M.L. Tuan R.S. Bradley J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 185-195Google Scholar, 9Prior A. Jones J.T. Blok V.C. Beauchamp J. McDermott L. Cooper A. Kennedy M.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 387-394Google Scholar, 26Blaxter M.L.

Parasitol. 2002; 122: 161-170Google Scholar), and inspection of expressed sequence tag and other surveys (see nema.cap.ed.ac.uk/Nest.html and Ref. 28Basavaraju S. Zhan B. Kennedy M.W. Liu Y. Hawdon J. Hotez P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 63-71Google Scholar) indicates that that some or all parasitic nematodes may produce more than one type of FAR, although it is not yet clear whether these represent alleles at a single locus or multiple genes. To understand the function of FAR proteins in parasitism, it is important to establish how many genes encoding FAR proteins exist in a given species, the function of the encoded proteins, and which are important in host-parasite interactions. At present such investigations would be difficult if not impossible in parasites, so we have begun an examination of the FAR proteins of the free-living nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, to understand the extent and biological functions of the FAR protein family. This has additional significance in that, of the 58% of the genes of this organism that appear to encode novel protein types (29Consortium, T. C. e. S. Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Google Scholar), the FAR proteins constitute one of only two protein types to which biochemical activities have been ascribed (1Kennedy M.W. Kennedy M.W. Harnett W. Parasitic Nematodes: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Immunology. CABI Publishing, Wallingford and New York2001: 309-330Google Scholar). Screening the genome sequence of the free-living soil nematode C. elegans has identified eight genes encoding FAR-like proteins. The amino acid sequences of these proteins are diverse, and a key question is whether the different proteins perform different functions in the biology of the organism. In addition, anticipating that parasitic nematodes may also be found to have multiple far genes, what might be the role of the encoded proteins in parasitism? To this end, we have cloned cDNA encoding all but one of the discernible FAR protein family members from C. elegans, examined the lipid binding and biophysical properties of the recombinant proteins, and followed the patterns of far gene transcription in the life cycle of the organism. Despite their considerable amino acid sequence diversity, the C. elegans FAR proteins were found to have similar lipid binding activities, although some possess distinctive properties. In terms of their amino acid sequences, we find that theC. elegans FAR proteins fall into three distinct groups and that the proteins so far described from parasitic nematodes cluster with one of these groups. This group may therefore have been important in the evolution of parasitism and justifies further examination usingC. elegans as a surrogate for establishing the roles of FAR proteins in the biology of nematodes. C. elegans far genes were identified by blastp and tblastn (30Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) searches of the C. elegans sequence data base available online at (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/C_elegans/blast_server.shtml) using the amino acid sequence of Ov-FAR-1 as the probe. High scoring matches were inspected to determine the relevance of the match, and a total of eightfar genes were identified. These eight genes were designatedCe-far-1 through Ce-far-8 and correspond to the following loci that were predicted by GENEFINDER (29Consortium, T. C. e. S. Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Google Scholar):Ce-far-1 is F02A9.2, Ce-far-2 is F02A9.3,Ce-far-3 is F15B9.1, Ce-far-4 is F15B9.2,Ce-far-5 is F15B9.3, Ce-far-6 is W02A2.2,Ce-far-7 is K01A2.2, and Ce-far-8 is K02F3.3. RT-PCR and RACE experiments corrected the GENEFINDER ORF predictions for F15B9.3 and K02F3.3. Additional blastp and tblastn searches of theC. elegans data base using the eight C. elegansFAR proteins as probes did not reveal the existence of any additionalfar genes in this organism. The C. elegans strains used in this study were supplied by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre and were the wild-type Bristol N2 strain and the mutant him-8(el489). The nematodes were maintained at 20 °C and were cultured as previously described (31Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from a mixed-stage population of wild-type C. elegans using TRIzol (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA by standard procedures (32Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). DNA encoding the C. elegans FAR proteins was amplified for cloning purposes by PCR using PCR primers that were designed to omit the putative signal peptide from those proteins that were predicted to have one. The sequences of the PCR primers that were used are as follows:Ce-far-1 forward primer, 5′-GGT ATT GAG GGT CGC GCT CCA GTC CCG GAG GTC C-3′; Ce-far-1 reverse primer, 5′-AGA GGA GAG TTA GAG CCT TAG TTG AGG TAT TGT CCG ACC A-3′; Ce-far-2forward primer, 5′-CAT ATG CCA ATC CCA GAG GTT CCA C-3′;Ce-far-2 reverse primer, 5′-GGA TCC TTA GTT GAC GTA TTG TCC GAC-3′; Ce-far-3 forward primer, 5′-CAT ATG GCT CCA GCT GAT GAT TCT TCT C-3′; Ce-far-3 reverse primer, 5′-GGA TCC ATT GTT CTT CTC AAG AAG CTT GG-3′; Ce-far-4 forward primer, 5′-GGT ATT GAG GGT CGC TTT CCA TTC GGA GAA CCA CA-3′;Ce-far-4 reverse primer, 5′-AGA GGA GAG TTA GAG CCT TAT TTT CCC ATA CCC ATT CCC-3′; Ce-far-5 forward primer, 5′-GGT ATT GAG GGT CGC GCT GAT GGA ATA TTT GAA GCT G-3′; Ce-far-5reverse primer, 5′-AGA GGA GAG TTA GAG CCT CAC AAC AAT TTA TCA ATC TCA GT-3′; Ce-far-6 forward primer, 5′-GGT ATT GAG GGT CGC GCT CCA ATT TCA CGC TTA CC-3′; Ce-far-6 reverse primer, 5′-AGA GGA GAG TTA GAG CCT TAG TAG TTC ACG ATC TGT TGG ATG-3′;Ce-far-7 forward primer, 5′-GGT ATT GAG GGT CGC ATG AGC GTT GCT TCA CTT CC-3′; Ce-far-7 reverse primer, 5′-AGA GGA GAG TTA GAG CCT CAA TCC GGA TTA TTC TTT CTC AGC-3′. The PCR products that were obtained for Ce-far-2 and Ce-far-3 were cloned into TOPO TA (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and they were then sequenced. The Ce-far-2 andCe-far-3 sequences were subcloned from TOPO TA into pET15b (Novagen) using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites that had been incorporated in the PCR primers. The two recombinant pET15b plasmids were maintained in Escherichia coli DH5α cells (Novagen) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) for expression of the recombinant fusion proteins. The PCR products that were obtained for the otherC. elegans FAR genes were cloned into pET30 Xa/LIC (Novagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and they were then sequenced. The recombinant pET30 Xa/LIC plasmids were maintained inE. coli NovaBlue cells (Novagen) and transformed intoE. coli BLR(DE3) cells (Novagen) for expression of the recombinant fusion proteins. The expression and purification of the proteins was performed in accordance with the kit manufacturer's instructions for high yield, the major proportion of each protein being water-soluble, and only batches exhibiting a single band under SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining were used. No detergents were added during the extraction procedures. The purified proteins were exhaustively dialyzed at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 171 mm NaCl, 3.35 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4; pH 7.2) and subsequently passed down a column of Extracti-Gel D resin (Pierce) to remove any contaminating detergent. Preliminary experiments showed that the biochemical properties of the recombinant fusion proteins were indistinguishable from those proteins from which the N-terminal fusion partner had been cleaved, either with thrombin for the pET15b clones or with Factor Xa for the pET30 Xa/LIC clones. In the interests of reducing manipulation, therefore, all the assays reported in this report were performed with the intact fusion proteins. The temporal expression pattern of each of the far genes was investigated by semi-quantitative PCR (sqRT-PCR). First-strand cDNA for the sqRT-PCR was generated from total RNA that had been isolated from embryos and from synchronous L1, L2, L3, L4, and young adult cultures of wild-type C. elegans, as previously described (33Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3633-3639Google Scholar, 34Larminie C.G. Johnstone I.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 75-82Google Scholar). The stage-specific cDNA samples were kindly provided by Dr. Antony Page (Wellcome Centre for Molecular Parasitology, University of Glasgow). For each developmental stage investigated, the abundance of a control gene, ama-1, was also estimated by sqRT-PCR. The primers that were used for the sqRT-PCR reactions all spanned at least one intron so that any contaminating genomic DNA would give PCR products that could be easily identified. The number of PCR cycles that gave linear amplification signals for each gene was determined empirically and varied between 30 and 35. The products of the sqRT-PCR reactions were visualized by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and their relative abundance was estimated by densitometric analysis of the ethidium bromide-stained bands. The gene transcription levels were calculated as the ratio of the abundance of the far gene sqRT-PCR products to that ofama-1 at each developmental stage. The sequences of the primers that were used in the sqRT-PCR reactions are as follows:Ce-far-1 forward primer, 5′-GCT CCA GTC CCG GAG GTC C-3′;Ce-far-1 reverse primer, 5′-TTA GTT GAG GTA TTG TCC GAC CA-3′; Ce-far-2 forward primer, 5′-CAT ATG CCA ATC CCA GAG GTT CCA C-3′; Ce-far-2 reverse primer, 5′-GGA TCC TTA GTT GAC GTA TTG TCC GAC-3′; Ce-far-3 forward primer, 5′-CAT ATG GCT CCA GCT GAT GAT TCT TCT C-3′; Ce-far-3 reverse primer, 5′-GGA TCC ATT GTT CTT CTC AAG AAG CTT GG-3′; Ce-far-4forward primer, 5′-CTC GAG TTT CCA TTC GGA GAA CCA CA-3′;Ce-far-4 reverse primer, 5′-GGA TCC TTA TTT TCC CAT ACC CAT TCC C-3′; Ce-far-5 forward primer, 5′-GGT ATT GAG GGT CGC GCT GAT GGA ATA TTT GAA GCT G-3′; Ce-far-5 reverse primer, 5′-AGA GGA GAG TTA GAG CCT CAC AAC AAT TTA TCA ATC TCA GT-3′;Ce-far-6 forward primer, 5′-CAT ATG GCT CCA ATT TCA CGC TTA CC-3′; Ce-far-6 reverse primer, 5′-GGA TCC GTA GTT CAC GAT CTG TTG GAT GA-3′; Ce-far-7 forward primer, 5′-GGT ATT GAG GGT CGC ATG AGC GTT GCT TCA CTT CC-3′; Ce-far-7 reverse primer, 5′-AGA GGA GAG TTA GAG CCT CAA TCC GGA TTA TTC TTT CTC AGC-3′;ama-1 forward primer, 5′-GTT CAG TTT GGA ATT CTC GG-3′;ama-1 reverse primer, 5′-GAT TTG TCG ATG AGA AGC C-3′. Experiments were also undertaken to determine whether any of theC. elegans far genes are up-regulated in males. The procedure was as described above, but first-strand cDNA for the sqRT-PCR was generated from total RNA that had been isolated from a mixed-stage culture of C. elegans him-8(el489). Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 20 °C with a SPEX FluorMax spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ) using 2-ml samples in silica cuvettes. Raman scattering by solvent water was corrected for where necessary using appropriate blank solutions. The fluorescent fatty acid analogs, 11-((5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)amino)undecanoic acid (DAUDA) and dansyl-dl-α-aminocaprylic acid (DACA), were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and Sigma (Poole, Dorset), respectively. All-trans-retinol and oleic acid were obtained from Sigma, and cis-parinaric acid was obtained from Molecular Probes. The excitation wavelengths used for DAUDA, DACA, retinol, and cis-parinaric acid were 345, 345, 350, and 319 nm, respectively. The dansylated fatty acids were stored as stock solutions of ∼10 mm in ethanol in the dark at −20 °C and freshly diluted in PBS to ∼1 μm by serial dilution in PBS for use in the fluorescence experiments. Retinol solutions were freshly prepared in ethanol at ∼0.1 mm and were added directly to solutions of the proteins in the fluorescence cuvettes immediately before use to minimize the degradation of retinol in aqueous solution before binding occurred. Oleic acid for competition studies was prepared as a stock solution in ethanol at ∼10 mm and diluted 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000 in PBS for use in the assays. The dissociation constants for DAUDA,cis-parinaric acid, and retinol were estimated by fluorescence titration experiments as previously described (10Kennedy M.W. Garside L.H. Goodrick L.E. McDermott L. Brass A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Bradley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29442-29448Google Scholar). For DAUDA and cis-parinaric acid, the protein solutions were added in small aliquots (typically 5 μl) to 2 ml of PBS containing the fluorescent ligands. For retinol, the fluorescent ligand was added incrementally (5 μl) to 2 ml of PBS containing the protein to be assayed. The concentrations of the proteins used in the titrations were estimated spectrophotometrically using a calculated theoretical extinction coefficient (using ProtParam software available at ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html) or by quantitative amino acid hydrolysis, and the concentrations of the fluorescent ligands were estimated using extinction coefficients of 52,480 at 325 nm for retinol, 76,000 at 276 nm for cis-parinaric acid, and 4,800 at 335 nm for DAUDA, using solutions diluted in ethanol or methanol as appropriate. The fluorescence titration data were corrected for dilution where necessary and fitted by standard non-linear regression techniques (using Microcal Origin software) to a single non-competitive binding model to give estimates of the dissociation constant (K d) and maximal fluorescence intensity (F max). The K d values for retinol were estimated with correction for the fluorescence of free retinol added to a cuvette containing only PBS, as previously described (35Cogan U. Kopelman M. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Google Scholar). The protein solutions were acidified with 5 m HCl and then extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The samples were centrifuged to disperse the resultant emulsion, and the organic layer was then transferred to a glass vial and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl) acetamide (50 μl) was added to the sample, which was then heated at 80 °C for 20 min. After cooling, 2 μl of the sample was injected into a Thermoseparations Automass Multi GC-MS instrument, which was fitted with a ZB-1 column (15-m length, 0.25-mm internal diameter, and 0.25-μm film). The GC oven was programmed as follows: 100 °C for 1 min, then 10 °C increase per min to 300 °C. The head pressure used was 20 kPa. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact mode at 70 eV and was scanned from 50–500 atomic mass units. The CD spectra of Ce-FAR-2 and Ce-FAR-3 were recorded at 20 °C in the far UV (260–195 nm) using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter and compared with earlier data on the Ov-FAR-1 protein from Onchocerca volvulus (10Kennedy M.W. Garside L.H. Goodrick L.E. McDermott L. Brass A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Bradley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29442-29448Google Scholar). For each protein, spectra were recorded in 0.02-cm path length cells at three different concentrations over the range 10–45 μm. Analysis of the CD spectra was undertaken using the CONTIN (36Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Google Scholar) and SELCON (37Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Google Scholar) procedures, which produced similar results, but the values quoted are from the latter, because in our experience the CONTIN method has a tendency to overestimate the proportion of β-sheet in helix-rich proteins. Progressive denaturation with GdnHCl was carried out and followed by CD as previously described (10Kennedy M.W. Garside L.H. Goodrick L.E. McDermott L. Brass A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Bradley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29442-29448Google Scholar). Experiments were performed by standard procedures (38Cooper A. Johnson C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 22: 137-150Google Scholar) using a Microcal VP-DSC instrument at a scan rate of 60 °C h−1 over a 20–110 °C range using sample concentrations of 0.7 mg ml−1. Normalized excess heat capacity data for thermal transitions were analyzed in terms of the standard non-two-state model, using Microcal ORIGIN software. This gives independent estimates of the calorimetric and van't Hoff unfolding enthalpies, ΔH cal and ΔH VH, from which the cooperativity of the transition may be evaluated (39Cooper A. Nutley M.A. Wadood A. Harding S.E. Chowdhry B.Z. Protein-Ligand Interactions: Hydrodynamics and Calorimetry. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York2000: 287-318Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed using programs available through the ExPASy molecular biology server (www.expasy.ch/tools). The SignalP program (40Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Google Scholar) was used to predict the presence and location of any signal peptide cleavage sites, and the PSORT program (41Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Google Scholar) was used to predict protein localization and sorting signals. The molecular weight and isoelectric point of the proteins were estimated using the ProtParam program, and all of the sequences were scanned for the occurrence of motifs stored in the PROSITE data base (42Falquet L. Pagni M. Bucher P. Hulo N. Sigrist C.J. Hofmann K. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 235-238Google Scholar). The sequences of the eight C. elegans FAR proteins were aligned with each other using the ClustalW program (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar), and the alignment was then examined to locate positions where amino acids are conserved or positions where the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the amino acids is conserved. Secondary structure predictions of the individual or the multiple aligned sequences were performed using the PHD and the Jpred programs (44Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Google Scholar). The ClustalW program was also used to generate an alignment of the eight C. elegansFAR sequences and the Ov-FAR-1 and Gp-FAR-1 sequences of O. volvulus and G. pallida. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the alignment using the maximum likelihood protein sequence parsimony method (45Strimmer K. von Haeseler A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6815-6819Google Scholar) and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (46Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). The trees were rooted against the FAR protein sequence of Ascaris suum (derived from an expressed sequence tag: accession number BF169343) or Ce-FAR-8. All methods produced trees of the same topology, and a typical result with bootstrap values is presented. TheC. elegans sequence data base was screened for the occurrence of Ov-FAR-1-like proteins by blastp and tblastn searches, yielding eight protein sequences that were designated Ce-FAR-1 to -8. RT-PCR and RACE experiments (data not shown) corrected the GENEFINDER ORF predictions for Ce-far-5 and Ce-far-8, which were originally predicted to be parts of larger (hybrid) proteins (F15B9.3 and K02F3.3, respectively). No PCR products were obtained for the full-length F15B9.3 and K02F3.3 gene predictions, and neitherCe-far-5 nor Ce-far-8 was found to be trans-spliced to the nematode-spliced leaders SL1 or SL2. The amino acid sequences of the eight C. elegans FAR proteins are aligned in Fig.1 A. The sequences are highly diverse, although with clear evidence of amino acid positions that are conserved absolutely or by biochemical character. Ce-FAR-1 to -6 all appear to have cleavable N-terminal leader/signal peptides predicted with acceptable probabilities by the SignalP and PSORT programs. SignalP predicted a leader for Ce-FAR-8 but not Ce-FAR-7, and PSORT predicted leaders for neither. C. elegans FAR proteins 1 through"

We show that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (NR1C3) coactivator-1 (PGC-1) requires both the intact AF-2 domain of PPARγ and the LXXLL domain of PGC-1 for ligand-dependent and ligand-independent interaction and coactivation. Although the AF-2 domain of PPARγ is absolutely required for PGC-1-mediated coactivation, this coactivator displayed a unique lack of requirement for the charge clamp of the ligand-binding domain of the receptor that is thought to be essential for LXXLL motif recognition. The mutation of a single serine residue adjacent to the core LXXLL motif of PGC-1 led to restoration of the typical charge clamp requirement. Thus, the unique structural features of the PGC-1 LXXLL motif appear to mediate an atypical mode of interaction with PPARγ. Unexpectedly, we discovered that various ligands display variability in terms of their requirement for the charge clamp of PPARγ for coactivation by PGC-1. This ligand-selective variable requirement for the charge clamp was coactivator-specific. Thus, distinct structural determinants, which may be unique for a particular ligand, are utilized by the receptor to recognize the coactivator. Our data suggest that even subtle differences in ligand structure are perceived by the receptor and translated into a unique display of the coactivator-binding surface of the ligand-binding domain, allowing for differential recognition of coactivators that may underlie distinct pharmacological profiles observed for ligands of a particular nuclear receptor.

Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Google Scholar). Although originally identified as an orphan receptor, PPARγ as well as the closely related receptors, PPARα (NR1C1) and PPARδ (NR1C2), are believed to bind to a variety of fatty acids and their metabolites (2Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Google Scholar). Synthetic agonists that activate PPARγ, such as the thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone, are effectively utilized in clinical practice as “insulin sensitizers” in type 2 diabetics (3Moller D.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 821-827Google Scholar). Like other nuclear receptors, PPARγ is comprised of several separable functional domains including a constitutively active transactivation domain, AF-1, in the amino-terminal region, a central highly conserved DNA-binding domain composed of two zinc fingers, and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) that contains a ligand-dependent transactivation function, AF-2, in its carboxyl-terminal region (4Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Google Scholar). PPARγ functions as an obligate heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and recognizes specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of target genes referred to as peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) (5Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 409-435Google Scholar). Once directed to the target gene, the transcriptional activation activity of the receptor is regulated by ligand. Ligand binding leads to a significant conformational change within the LBD that includes repositioning of the amphipathic helix 12 containing the core of the AF-2 domain of the receptor, which results in the creation of a recognition surface for coactivator proteins (6Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Google Scholar,7Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Google Scholar). This conformational change allows for the recruitment of coactivators that subsequently mediate transcriptional activation via recruitment of additional factors and enzymatic activity such as histone acetylation (8Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent recruitment of coactivators is a critical step for nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activation. A large number of nuclear receptor coactivators, often ubiquitously expressed, have been identified and characterized, and many of these coactivators utilize a conserved mechanism to recognize and interact with a ligand-bound nuclear receptor (9Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar). Coactivators such as the p160 family SRC-1 (10Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W.

A. 1996; 93: 8329-8333Google Scholar), interact directly with the LBD via an amphipathic α-helical motif with the consensus sequence LXXLL (where L is leucine andX is any amino acid), also known as a NR box (9Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar). The conformational change induced by ligand creates a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the receptor that is bounded by two charged residues. The leucine side chains comprising the hydrophobic face of the coactivator LXXLL helix recognize the hydrophobic groove of the LBD surface, whereas two highly conserved residues of the LBD, a positively charged lysine residue (helix 3) and a negatively charged glutamic acid residue (helix 12) on either side of the groove, contribute an additional degree of selectivity by clamping the coactivator LXXLL motif at both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends by hydrogen bonding with the backbone of this motif (6Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Google Scholar, 7Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Google Scholar). Completion of the charge clamp requires the ligand-dependent repositioning of helix 12 in order to place the absolutely conserved glutamic acid residue of AF-2 in the correct position to recognize the coactivator LXXLL motif. Consistent with this model of coactivator recognition of ligand-bound receptor, mutation of either component of the charge clamp significantly decreases the ability of a nuclear receptor to interact with coactivators and activate transcription (6Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Google Scholar, 24Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M. Agostini M. Adams M.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1778-1792Google Scholar). Although this mechanism of coactivator recognition by nuclear receptors is conserved across the superfamily, significant specificity is contributed by both the coactivators and the receptors (8Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Google Scholar).

The coactivator PGC-1 (PPARγ coactivator-1) was originally identified as an atypical coactivator for PPARγ (37Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar). Unlike most coactivators, the expression of PGC-1 is both tissue-specific and highly regulatable. PGC-1 has been demonstrated to play an essential role in a variety of physiological processes such as adaptive thermogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and exercise/muscle adaptation (37Puigserver P.

Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Google Scholar). Another unique feature of PGC-1 is its ability to interact with PPARγ in a ligand-independent manner, which has been attributed to a novel mechanism of interaction mediated via the hinge region of PPARγ instead of the LBD and independent of the LXXLL motif of PPARγ (37Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar). However, PGC-1 can also serve as a coactivator for many other nuclear receptors including PPARα, TR, RXRα, GR, and ERα via the more classical ligand-dependent mode of interaction mediated through the LBD of the receptor and the LXXLL motif (42Delerive P. Wu Y. Burris T.P. Chin W.W. Suen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3913-3917Google Scholar, 43Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Google Scholar, 44Tcherepanova I.

These observations along with evidence that, under certain circumstances such as coactivation of PPARγ regulation ofucp-1 expression, PGC-1 functions in a strictly ligand-dependent manner led us to investigate the mechanism of coactivation of PPARγ by PGC-1. Gal4-PPARγ1 and the various deletions and mutations were created by cloning PCR-amplified DNA fragments corresponding to the various PPARγ regions into theMluI and XbaI sites of the pM vector (Clontech). The DNA fragments containing the full-length human PPARγ1 and PPARγ1 ΔAF-2 obtained from the digestion of the corresponding pM-PPARγ constructs withSmaI and XbaI were also cloned into theEcoRV and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 to generate pcDNA3-PPARγ1 and pcDNA3-PPARγ1 ΔAF-2. TheapoAII PPRE-tk-Luc reporter was a kind gift from Dr. P. Delerive and was described previously (47Delerive P. De Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.-C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32049-32054Google Scholar). The Gal4-PPARγ E471A mutant was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. VP16-PGC-1 (encoding PGC-1 amino acids 100–411), the LXXLL-motif mutant VP16-PGC-1AXXAA, and pcDNA3-PGC-1 expressing full-length human PGC-1 were described previously (45Wu Y. Delerive P. Chin W.W. Burris T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8898-8905Google Scholar). The pcDNA3-PGC-1 S(−2)A mutant was generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To ensure the fidelity of the resulting constructs, all of the predicted mutations and PCR-based constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15dPGJ2) was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone were synthesized using standard organic chemistry synthetic methods. HeLa or CV-1 cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Prior to transfection, the cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% serum. After 16 h of growth at 37 C, 5% CO2, cells were transfected with the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The next morning, the transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh media containing 0.5% charcoal-stripped serum and rosiglitazone (0.3 × 10−6m), pioglitazone (10−6m), and 15dPGJ2(10−6m), if indicated, were added. After 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with a cell culture lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured in a Dynex luminometer. Generally, all transfections included 50 ng of expression vector for receptors, 100 ng of expression vector for coactivators, and 250 ng of pG5 luciferase reporter. All of the experiments were completed at least twice in triplicate. GST pull-down assays were performed as previously described with minor modifications (45Wu Y. Delerive P. Chin W.W. Burris T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8898-8905Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with in vitro translated35S-labeled receptors in a binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After an incubation for 1–2 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of 0.3 × 10−6m rosiglitazone, the beads were extensively washed with the binding buffer and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The structure of the second LXXLL motif of SRC-1 bound in the coactivator-binding site of PPARγ (Protein Data Bank accession code 2PRG) (6Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Google Scholar) was used to model the structure of PPARγ/PGC-1. Residues in the SRC-1 LXXLL peptide were mutated to mimic the sequence of the PGC-1 LXXLL peptide. These changes are His to Pro (−3), Lys to Ser (−2), Ile to Leu (−1), His to Lys (+2), Arg to Lys (+3), Gln to Leu (+6), and Glu to Ala (+7) where the number in the parentheses is relative to the first Leu of the LXXLL motif. The side-chain conformations of the mutated residues were modeled as close as possible with those of the SRC-1 LXXLL peptide, whereas the main-chain conformation remained unchanged. To investigate the role of the AF-2 domain in PGC-1 coactivation of PPARγ activity, a set of PPARγ deletion constructs (Fig.1 A) fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain were generated and used to perform mammalian one-hybrid assays in HeLa cells. In our initial transfection experiments, rosiglitazone was solely used to treat the cells prior to the measurement of reporter gene expression. As shown in Fig.1 B, the transcriptional activity of the Gal4-PPARγ fusion was stimulated by PGC-1 ∼38-fold in the absence and 12-fold in the presence of rosiglitazone. Interestingly, as seen previously with TRβ1, the amino-terminal deletion containing only the intact PPARγ LBD (LBD-H1) gave rise to an additional ∼2.5-fold increase in PGC-1-mediated enhancement both in a ligand-dependent and ligand-independent manner (45Wu Y. Delerive P. Chin W.W. Burris T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8898-8905Google Scholar). These results indicate that coactivation of the PPARγ by PGC-1 has both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent components and is mediated by the LBD independent of the hinge region. In contrast, Fig.1 B further revealed that the AF-2 deletion (carboxyl-terminal six amino acids deletion) completely abolished both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent PGC-1 coactivation of PPARγ. Similar results were also seen when a reporter containing multiple copies the apoAII PPRE upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene was used to determine the necessity of the AF-2 for PGC-1 coactivation of full-length PPARγ activity (Fig. 1 C). In addition, we observed that PGC-1 is also unable to coactivate the helix 1-deletion mutant LBD-ΔH1, even in the presence of the cognate ligand. These data suggest that both the AF-2 domain and helix 1 are indispensable for PGC-1 coactivation of PPARγ, a finding reminiscent of PGC-1-mediated coactivation of TR (45Wu Y. Delerive P. Chin W.W. Burris T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8898-8905Google Scholar). Interestingly, helix 1 has been shown to be required for SF-1 and other NR functions, indicating that the helix 1 requirement for LBD function may be universal within the NR superfamily (48Desclozeaux M. Krylova I.N. Horn F. Fletterick R.J. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7193-7203Google Scholar, 49Pissios P. Tzameli I. Kushner P. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 245-253Google Scholar). The α-helical LXXLL motif present in PGC-1 has been demonstrated to be required for PGC-1-mediated coactivation of several nuclear receptors, including PPARα, ERα, GR, and HNF4α (40Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Google Scholar, 43Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Google Scholar, 44Tcherepanova I. Puigserver P. Norris J.D. Spiegelman B.M. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16302-16308Google Scholar, 46Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Google Scholar). To ascertain whether this LXXLL motif is involved in the coactivation of PPARγ by PGC-1, we cotransfected HeLa cells with the full-length PGC-1 harboring a mutation of the LXXLL motif (LXXLL→AXXAA) along with Gal4-PPARγ. As shown in Fig. 2, the mutation of the LXXLL motif of PGC-1 eliminated both the ligand-dependent and the ligand-independent modes of coactivation, implicating the LXXLL motif as the critical element in mediating the effect of PGC-1 on PPARγ. We next performed GST pull-down and mammalian two-hybrid assays to examine the physical interaction between PGC-1 and PPARγ. GST pull-down assays were performed using the full-length PPARγ and an AF-2 deletion mutant expressed as in vitrotranscribed/translated 35S-labeled proteins and a fragment of PGC-1 (amino acids 100–411) spanning the LXXLL motif expressed as a GST fusion protein. Fig.3 A shows that wild-type PPARγ constitutively interacted with GST-PGC-1 to a similar degree both in the presence or absence of rosiglitazone, which is in agreement with a previous report (37Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar) and our functional assays (Fig. 1). Consistent with our cotransfection experiments, deletion of AF-2 severely impaired both the ligand-dependent and ligand-independent interaction between PPARγ and GST-PGC-1. In addition, the mutation of the LXXLL motif of PGC-1 (AXXAA) resulted in the inability to interact with wild-type PPARγ. The roles of AF-2 and the LXXLL motif in PGC-1-PPARγ interactions assessed by GST pull-down assays were further confirmed by mammalian two-hybrid analysis. As shown in Fig.3 B, the expression of VP16-PGC-1 (amino acids 100–411) elevated the basal Gal4-PPARγ activity 3.8-fold in the absence and 2.1-fold in the presence of rosiglitazone, a reflection of the recruitment of VP16-PGC-1 by PPARγ in both circumstances. However, this constitutive recruitment by PPARγ was abolished when the LXXLL core sequence within VP16-PGC-1 was mutated to AXXAA. These results confirm our initial observation that both AF-2 of PPARγ and the LXXLL motif of PGC-1 play a critical role in mediating PGC-1-PPARγ interactions as well as PGC-1 coactivation on PPARγ. The AF-2 domain (helix 12) of nuclear receptors contains a highly conserved glutamic acid residue that along with a conserved lysine residue within helix 3 comprises a charge clamp that specifies the length and orientation of the α-helical LXXLL motif of the coactivator recognized by the hydrophobic groove on the LBD surface of the receptor (6Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Google Scholar, 7Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Google Scholar, 50Bourguet W. Germain P. Gronemeyer H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 381-388Google Scholar). In general, the charge clamp is required for recruitment of coactivator, an essential step for nuclear receptor-mediated gene activation. However, we recently reported that although the effect of PGC-1 on TRβ1 is AF-2-dependent and requires an intact helix 12, the highly conserved Glu457 within the helix 12 is dispensable for PGC-1 action (45Wu Y. Delerive P. Chin W.W. Burris T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8898-8905Google Scholar). To explore this issue further and determine whether the charge clamp is required for PGC-1 coactivation of PPARγ, we transiently transfected the plasmids expressing a corresponding Gal4-PPARγ E471A mutant along with PGC-1 into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig.4, in the absence of PGC-1, Gal4-PPARγ displayed a very low basal activity relative to a vector control. The addition of rosiglitazone resulted in a 3.3-fold induction of Gal4-PPARγ activity. This agonist-induced transcriptional activity was completely abolished by the introduction of E471A mutation into the Gal4-PPARγ, suggesting that the E471A mutation impaired the recruitment of endogenous coactivators in the cells. In the presence of PGC-1, as demonstrated earlier, the level of transcriptional activity of Gal4-PPARγ was elevated to ∼21-fold in the presence and ∼60-fold in the absence of rosiglitazone, respectively. Intriguingly, the E471A mutant displayed no effect on PGC-1-mediated enhancement in its ligand-dependent component but dramatically impaired the ligand-independent component (Fig. 4). Thus, PGC-1 utilizes a unique mechanism of interaction with PPARγ that bypasses the requirement of the charge clamp. However, this unique ability to bypass the charge clamp is only displayed for the ligand-dependent mode of interaction. Interestingly, the ligand-independent mode of interaction of PGC-1 with PPARγ is also dependent on an intact LXXLL motif (Fig. 2) and requires an intact charge clamp, suggesting that although the identical recognition motif is utilized by PGC-1 to bind to PPARγ, unique structural features are utilized for recognition in the presence of ligand versus the absence of ligand. In contrast to PGC-1, coactivation of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent Gal4-PPARγ activities by GRIP-1 was severely impaired by the E471A mutation (Fig.4), indicating that GRIP-1 does not possess the unique structural features of PGC-1 that allows for such an unusual pattern of interaction with PPARγ. It is well documented that the sequences adjacent to the LXXLL motif play an essential role in determining coactivator-receptor binding preferences (13Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y.

It is seen in the exoskeleton of arthropods where the chitin microfibrils complex with proteins to form the chitinous structures of the cuticle and the peritrophic membrane (PM)1 lining the gut (1Shao L. Devenport M. Jacobs-lorena M. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 47: 119-125Google Scholar, 2de la Vega H. Specht C.A. Liu Y. Robbins P.W. Insect Mol. Biol. 1998; 7: 233-239Google Scholar). The PM extracellularly surrounds the food bolus in the guts of most arthropods (3Peters W. Bradshaw S.D. Burggren W. Heller H.C. Ishii S. Langer H. Neuweiler G. Randall D.J.

It has been shown to be important in preventing damage or clogging of microvilli by the luminal contents (5Richards A.G. Richards P.A. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1977; 22: 219-240Google Scholar, 6Burner R.

Shahabuddin M. Sacks D.L. Parasitology. 1997; 115: 359-369Google Scholar). However, arthropods must be able to hydrolyze the chitin to allow degradation of the cuticle and development during the immature stages. Events during the molting cycle have been investigated biochemically and morphologically (9Reynolds S.E. Samuels R.I. Adv. Insect Physiol. 1996; 26: 157-232Google Scholar), and chitinase has been shown to be an essential component in the hydrolysis of chitin. Ticks are hemimetabolous in nature, implying they also require chitinolytic enzymes to remove old cuticle and allow synthesis of new cuticle for continued growth and development. Chitinase is induced by ecdysteroids to degrade the older chitin at the time of molting (10Kimura S. J. Insect Physiol. 1973; 19: 115-123Google Scholar,11Koga D. Fujimoto H. Funakoshi T. Mizuki Ide A. Kramer K.J. Zen K.C. Choi H. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 305-311Google Scholar). The chitinase inhibitor, allosamidin, isolated from culture broth of Streptomyces sp. (12Sakuda S. Isogai A. Matsumoto A. Suzuki A. Koseki K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1986; 27: 2475-2478Google Scholar), has been used as an important tool to elucidate several essential features of insect chitinases (13Spindler K.D. Spindler-Barth M. Jollès P. Muzzarelli R.A.A. Chitin and Chitinases. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1999: 201-209Google Scholar). Ticks are second only to mosquitoes as vectors of disease-causing agents in humans and are the most important arthropod transmitting pathogens to domestic and wild animals, e.g. Babesia and Theileria protozoa,Borrelia bacteria, and hemorrhagic and encephalomyelitis virus (14Balashov Y.S. Misc. Publ. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1972; 8: 161-376Google Scholar, 15Hoogstraal H. Adv. Parasitol. 1985; 24: 135-238Google Scholar). The hard tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, is distributed mainly in East Asia and Australia, where it transmits these pathogens (16Fujisaki K. Natl. Inst. Anim. Health Quart. (Yatabe). 1978; 18: 27-38Google Scholar, 17Fujisaki K. Kawazu S. Kamio T. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 31-33Google Scholar). A variety of methods have been employed to suppress tick vector populations, including the application of biological control agents and the heavy reliance on chemical acaricides. However, the development of resistance to acaricides (18Rand K.N. Moore T. Srikantha A. Spring K. Tellam R. Willadsen P. Cobon G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Trends Parasitol. 2002; 18: 161-163Google Scholar) and the increase in legislation to combat detrimental effects of residues of acaricides in the environment (21Willadsen P. Kemp D.H. Parasitol. Today. 1988; 4: 196-198Google Scholar) emphasize the need to develop alternatives for tick vector control. Recently, we have shown that troponin I (22You M. Xuan X. Tsuji N. Kamio T. Igarashi I. Nagasawa H. Mikami T. Fujisaki K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 32: 67-73Google Scholar) and peroxiredoxin (23Tsuji N. Kamio T. Isobe T. Fujisaki K. Insect Mol. Biol. 2001; 10: 121-129Google Scholar) from H. longicornis may be candidates for control of ticks. Molting-associated molecules responsible for protecting from invasion of pathogens, control of the PM, and other necessary functions during blood feeding and molting in ticks may be candidates for tick control. Chitinase is a selective insect control protein and is safe as it is readily degradable in the environment (24Gopalakrishnan B. Muthukrishnan S. Kramer K.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 255-265Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the cDNA cloning, identification, characterization, and expression of chitinase from the hard tick,H. longicornis. In addition, we discuss the possible application of tick chitinase in the control of tick vectors. The parthenogenetic Okayama strain of the hard tickH. longicornis (16Fujisaki K. Natl. Inst. Anim.

Total RNA from eggs of H. longicornis was isolated using the thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed by standard techniques (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PCR products were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the band of predictive size was purified and cloned into pBluescript SK(+) vector by standard techniques (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Construction of a cDNA expression library was performed as described previously (22You M. Xuan X. Tsuji N. Kamio T. Igarashi I. Nagasawa H. Mikami T. Fujisaki K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 32: 67-73Google Scholar). The cDNA expression library was screened with an alkaline phosphatase-labeled DNA fragment amplified by PCR with degenerate primers. Plating phages and plaque lifting were performed according to the manufacture's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Labeling probes, prehybridization, and hybridization were performed according to Alkphos Direct manual (Amersham Biosciences). Positive plaques were rescreened until 100% plaque purification was achieved. The cloned insert in the plaque-purified λ phage was subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) by using the in vivo excision capabilities of λ ZAP II. Restriction enzyme-generated fragments for sequencing were subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) vectors. An insert cDNA designated CHT1 cDNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method using M13 reverse and universal primers (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequence analysis was performed with the computer program MacVector (Oxford Molecular, Madison, WI). A 2790-bp PCR fragment from H. longicornis chitinase containing an open reading frame was inserted into the EcoRI site of pGEX-4T-3 to generate the recombinant plasmid pGEX-4T-CHT1. Restriction enzyme analysis was performed to identify the construct containing the insert in the correct orientation. Expression of the CHT1 cDNA in E. coli was performed as described previously (22You M. Xuan X. Tsuji N. Kamio T. Igarashi I. Nagasawa H. Mikami T. Fujisaki K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 32: 67-73Google Scholar). The recombinant CHT1 (rCHT1) was expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and designated GST-CHT1 protein. Female mice (BALB/c, 8 weeks old) were immunized intraperitoneally three times at 2-week intervals with 100 μg of the recombinant fusion protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Sera were collected from immunized mice 10 days after the last immunization. Tick extracts were treated with an equal volume of urea mixture consisting of 9 m urea, 4% Nonidet P-40, 0.8% ampholine (pH 3.5–8; Amersham Biosciences), and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and then subjected to two-dimensional PAGE. Non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis was performed (29O'Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1141Google Scholar) in the first dimension using a rectangular gel electrophoresis apparatus (AE-6050 A; ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). After electrophoresis at 400 V for 2 h, the gels were incubated in the equilibration buffer for 10 min on a shaker. Electrophoresis in the second dimension was performed on 8% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. The proteins were either stained using a silver staining kit (Dai-ichi Pure Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as previously described (30Tsuji N. Morales T.H. Ozols V.V. Carmody A.B. Chandrashekar R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 69-79Google Scholar). Anti-mouse rCHT1 serum was used at a dilution of 1:500. The proteins bound to the secondary antibody were visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Formaldehyde-denatured RNA (10 μg) extracted from eggs of H. longicornis incubated at 25 °C for 10 days was fractionated on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with an alkaline phosphatase-labeled probe derived from the CHT1 cDNA. The presence of probe was detected using CDP-Star (Amersham Biosciences) by chemiluminescent technique. The hybridization technique was performed as described in the Alkphos Direct manual (Amersham Biosciences). Spodographa frugiperda(Sf9) cells were propagated at 27 °C in TC-100 and SF-900 II serum-free insect cell culture medium obtained from Invitrogen.Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhidrosis virus (AcMNPV) and recombinant viruses were grown in Sf9 cells. The 2790-bp PCR fragment from H. longicornis CHT1 cDNA containing the open reading frame was inserted into the EcoRI site of an AcMNPV transfer vector, pBlueBac4.5/V5-His (Invitrogen) to produce the recombinant transfer plasmid pBlueBac4.5/V5-His-CHT1, and the recombinant protein was expressed by recombinant baculovirus as a protein fused with a COOH-terminal peptide (3 kDa) containing the V5 epitope and a His6 tag. Restriction enzyme analysis was performed to identify the construct containing the insert in the correct orientation. Sf9 cells were cotransfected with pBlueBac4.5/V5-His-CHT1 and linear AcMNPV DNA, Bac-N-Blue DNA (Invitrogen), by using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). After 4 days of incubation at 27 °C, the culture supernatant containing recombinant virus was harvested and subjected to plaque purification. The expression of rCHT1 in the plaques was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test with anti-rCHT1 serum. Positive plaques were selected, and after three cycles of purification a recombinant virus, AcMNPV·CHT1 was obtained. Thirty ml of Sf9 cells culture supernatant infected with the recombinant virus (AcMNPV·CHT1) or as a control infected with the wild type virus (AcMNPV·wt) were dialyzed against binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole (pH 7.4)) and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Concentrator 10/20, exclusion size: 30 kDa). Two ml of 50% nickel nitrilotriacetic acid slurry (Invitrogen) was centrifuged (5 min at 500 × g) and washed twice with binding buffer. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C under continuous shaking, the slurry was centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed at 4 °C with 20 ml of washing buffer (20 mmsodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl (pH 6.0)) containing 50 mm imidazole. Elution was performed with 5 ml of elution buffer (pH 6.0) containing 350 mm imidazole. The final eluent containing the isolated protein was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. 4-Methylumbelliferyl-N,N′,N ′′-triacetyl-β-chitotrioside (Sigma) (4MU-(GlcNAc)3) was used for chitinase activity assay at a concentration of 0.8 mm in distilled water. Kinetic studies of chitinase were performed in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation 350 nm, emission 450 nm) (Japan spectrophotometer FP-770, Tokyo, Japan) by continuously recording changes in fluorescence. Inhibition of chitinase activity was studied by using allosamidin at a final concentration of 0.01 and 0.05 μm in the reaction mixture. Allosamidin was obtained from S. Sakuda (12Sakuda S. Isogai A. Matsumoto A. Suzuki A. Koseki K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1986; 27: 2475-2478Google Scholar). Reactions were started by the addition of enzyme (1 μg). The enzymatic activity of the rCHT1 was quantified using 4MU-(GlcNAc)3 (31McCreath K.J. Goody G.W. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1992; 14: 229-237Google Scholar). The enzyme solutions (0.16 μg) were incubated with substrate (4MU-(GlcNAc)3) in a wide range buffer (pH 2.0–12.0) (32Carmody W.R. J. Chem. Educ. 1961; 38: 550-559Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 15 min (final concentration 3.8 μm). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1.2 ml of 1 mglycine buffer. In the chitinase activity assay, the enzyme solutions (0.16 μg) were incubated with substrate (4MU-(GlcNAc)3) in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) at 4, 15, 27, 37, 45, 50, 60, and 70 °C for 15 min (final concentration 3.8 μm). Reactions were terminated by addition of 1.2 ml of 1m glycine buffer. Glycosylation studies with tunicamycin were performed as described previously (24Gopalakrishnan B. Muthukrishnan S. Kramer K.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 255-265Google Scholar). Briefly, tunicamycin (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 10 μg/ml to the Sf9 cells 15 h after infection with AcMNPV·CHT1. Purified rCHT1 (20 μg) was treated with N-glycosidase F under denaturing conditions as recommended by the manufacturer (N-glycosidase F deglycosylation kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and analyzed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-rCHT1 serum. Immunohistochemistry was performed with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody as described previously (22You M. Xuan X. Tsuji N. Kamio T. Igarashi I. Nagasawa H. Mikami T. Fujisaki K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 32: 67-73Google Scholar). Molting nymphs 10 days after engorgement, unfed females, and tick tissues were handled as described previously (22You M. Xuan X. Tsuji N. Kamio T. Igarashi I. Nagasawa H. Mikami T. Fujisaki K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 32: 67-73Google Scholar). AcMNPV·CHT1 culture medium (ACM) was applied topically to the dorsal surface of unfedH. longicornis larvae and adults. Ticks were collected 10 days after application. The salivary glands of adult ticks were dissected under a microscope (16Fujisaki K. Natl. Inst. Anim. Health Quart. (Yatabe). 1978; 18: 27-38Google Scholar). The dissected ticks were stored at −80 °C until use. Salivary glands were embedded in embedding medium (Tissue-Tek®, Sakura, Tokyo, Japan) and fixed using standard methods. Thin transverse sections of the ticks ∼7 μm thick were then prepared using a microtome. The slides were blocked for 1 h with 3% skim milk (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) in PBS and then incubated for 4 h at room temperature with mouse anti-rCHT1 serum diluted to 1:200 with PBS. The slides were rinsed thoroughly with PBS and reacted 1 h with red fluorescence-labeled mouse IgG secondary antibody (Alexa Flouor 594® goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The slides were then rinsed thoroughly with PBS, covered with glass slips, and observed under a fluorescence microscope (ECLIPSE E600, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Larvae ticks topically treated with ACM were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, homogenized, and used for immunoblots as described previously (22You M. Xuan X. Tsuji N. Kamio T. Igarashi I. Nagasawa H. Mikami T. Fujisaki K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 32: 67-73Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated for 1 h with anti-V5-AP antibody (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:500. The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper appears in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM nucleotide sequence data base with the accession number AB074977. Four degenerate primers based on a conserved region in the cDNAs of several chitinases were used to amplify the H. longicornis chitinase cDNA fragment. A PCR fragment of 291 bp was inserted into pBluescript SK(+) vector and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR fragment from H. longicornishad a putative conserved chitinase domain. The PCR fragment was used as a probe for screening the entire chitinase cDNA from the cDNA library of H. longicornis eggs. Five positive clones were isolated from the H. longicornis egg cDNA library, and no sequence heterogeneity was found among these clones. The clones appeared to be about 2.9, 4.1, 4.3, 5.5, and 6.5 kilobase pairs in size. One of the 5 cDNA clones of 6.5 kilobase pairs was designated CHT1. DNA sequencing revealed that the CHT1 cDNA with 6439 bp had a start codon at 571–573 bases and a stop codon at 3358–3360 bases (Fig. 1). CHT1 cDNA has an open reading frame extending from position 571 to position 3360 and codes 930 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of about 104 kDa (Fig. 1). This deduced protein has six potentialN-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1). The mRNA corresponding to the cloned cDNA was confirmed by Northern blotting analysis of total RNA extracted from eggs of H. longicornis ticks to be about 7.5 kilobases in size (Fig. 2).Figure 2Northern blot of mRNA of the CHT1 cDNA. Total RNA isolated from adult female H. longicornis ticks was resolved on an 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 3, the molecular mass of GST-CHT1 fusion protein was estimated as 130 kDa containing a GST protein of 26 kDa. The mouse anti-rCHT1 serum reacted with a 116-kDa protein from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell culture medium and 107- and 116-kDa proteins from the recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell extracts (see Fig. 5 A, lanes 2and 4).Figure 5Immunoblot detection of glycosylation inH. longicornis rCHT1. A: lane 1, lysate from cells with tunicamycin treatment; lane 2, lysate from cells without tunicamycin treatment; lane 3, medium from cells with tunicamycin treatment; lane 4, medium from cells without tunicamycin treatment in Sf9 cells. B: lane 1, lysate from cells with tunicamycin treatment; lane +, rCHT1 treated withN-glycosidase F (PNGase F; lane −, rCHT1 untreated with N-glycosidase F (control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We performed two-dimensional immunoblot analysis to identify endogenous CHT1 in ticks. Mouse anti-rCHT1 serum strongly reacted with a protein having a molecular mass of 108 kDa with a pI of 5.0 (Fig.4 A), confirming that it corresponded to the predicted size of the putative mature protein (104 kDa) calculated from the CHT1 amino acid sequence except for a signal peptide. In addition, an endogenous CHT1 was identified on silver-stained two-dimensional gels on which more than 200 visible protein spots appeared (Fig. 4 B). To determine the internal amino acid residues, protein spots of interest were excised from tick extracts using the two-dimensional gels and processed as described previously (33Chandrashekar R. Tsuji N. Morales T. Ozols V. Mehta K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 531-536Google Scholar). The spots were pooled from 20 gels, washed with a solution of 2% citrate, and subjected to lysyl endopeptidase digestion at 35 °C for overnight (34Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Claude J. Guillemot C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Google Scholar). After in-gel digestion of the protein, peptides were collected by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and several peptides was analyzed for internal amino acid sequence in Procise 494 cLC protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) (35Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Google Scholar, 36Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1539-1550Google Scholar). The resultant amino acid sequences of four major reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography purified peaks were identical to those of the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by CHT1 cDNA. Expression of chitinase in AcMNPV·CHT1-infected Sf9 cells in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein N-linked glycosylation, is shown in Fig. 5 A. In the absence of tunicamycin, immunoreactive chitinase was released into the medium as a 116-kDa protein (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). However, tunicamycin inhibited the secretion of this protein into the medium (Fig. 5 A, lane 3). In extracts of cells not treated with tunicamycin, the anti-rCHT1 serum reacted with major proteins of ∼107 and 116 kDa. Cells treated with tunicamycin exhibited an immunoreactive protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 107 kDa (Fig. 5 A, lane 1).N-Glycosidase-treated rCHT1 protein exhibited a shift to a lower apparent molecular mass of about 107 kDa (Fig. 5 B,lane 2), indicating the existence of N-linked glycan chains. The His-taggedH. longicornis rCHT1 was separated from the endogenous viral chitinases using affinity chromatography. In vitro chitinase activity assay using the purified rCHT1 showed a strong hydrolysis of 4MU-(GlcNAc)3 substrate (Fig.6). In vitro inhibition assay of chitinase activity using 0.05 μm (final concentration) allosamidin with purified rCHT1 showed a strong inhibition of the chitinase activity (Fig. 6). The specific activity (fluorescence unit) of His6-tagged H. longicornis rCHT1 against 4MU-(GlcNAc)3 was optimal at pH 5–7 but was inactive under acidic (pH < 3) or alkaline (pH > 10) conditions (Fig.7 A). The enzymatic activities increased gradually as the temperature was raised from 0 to 45–50 °C (Fig. 7 B). The maximum activity was exhibited at 45 °C (Fig. 7 B). The enzymatic activities started to decrease dramatically when the temperature was above 50 °C (Fig.7 B). The heat stability of the enzyme was tested after preincubation in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 4, 15, 27, 37, 45, 50, 60, and 70 °C for 60 min. The results are shown in Fig. 7 C. The rCHT1 protein was stable up to 45 °C and completely inactivated at 60 °C and higher temperatures.Figure 7Effect of pH (A) and temperature (B) on H. longicornis rCHT1 activity and enzyme stability (C) after preincubation at different temperature values. Enzyme activity was assayed using 4MU-(GlcNAc)3 as the substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are presented as fluorescence units. Mean ± S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The location of native CHT1 in molting nymphal ticks was determined by immunohistochemistry using mouse anti-rCHT1 serum. The immunohistochemistry analysis showed chitinase of H. longicornis in epidermis and midgut of molting nymphs after engorgement (Fig.8 A) and non-engorged females (Fig. 8 B). Reaction was strongly detected between old and new cuticle in molting nymphs (Fig. 8 A). No reaction was detectable using preimmune mouse serum (Fig. 8, panels a′–d′) in molting nymphs after engorgement and non-engorged females. The detection of rCHT1 expressed in H. longicornis infected with AcMNPV·CHT1 was performed with mouse anti-rCHT1 serum. H. longicornis adult females treated topically with ACM were dissected. A flat section of salivary gland was reacted with mouse anti-rCHT1 serum by immunofluorescence assay. Red fluorescence was present on the flat section treated with ACM (Fig.9 A). Existence of rCHT1 in infected H. longicornis larvae was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis with anti-V5-AP antibody (Fig. 9 B).H. longicornis larvae lysate treated with ACM reacted with the 107-kDa band. Chitinases are extremely important for the hydrolytic cleavage of the β-glycosidic linkages between GlcNAc residues of chitin to allow molting and growth in the arthropods. In general this hydrolysis can occur in one of two ways, either with retention of anomeric configuration in the product or with inversion (37Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Google Scholar). Several arthropod chitinases have been identified (25Kramer K.J. Corpuz L.M. Choi H. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 691-701Google Scholar, 26Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.S. Kim S.C. Park H.Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Google Scholar, 38Shinoda T. Kobayashi J. Matsui M. Chinzei Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 521-532Google Scholar), but this is the first report for identification of chitinase in the arachnids, including ticks. The complete sequence of a chitinase cDNA, CHT1, was obtained from a cDNA library of H. longicornis eggs. The open reading frame codes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 104 kDa. The NH2-terminal sequences of the encoded protein contain numerous hydrophobic residues, characteristic of a leader peptide (Fig.1). The putative cleavage site of the signal peptide was between residues 22 and 23 as determined by signalP prediction (39Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Google Scholar). Expression of the CHT1 cDNA in S. frugiperda cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus under the control of a polyhedrin promoter produced and secreted an enzymatically active protein with a molecular mass of 116 kDa. These results indicate the presence of a functional signal peptide. H. longicornis CHT1 possesses potentialN-glycosylation sites at the amino acid residues 115–118 (NPSL), 257–260 (NETT), 479–482 (NWSA), 729–732 (NLTD), 745–748 (NYTG) and 909–912 (NESV). Studies with tunicamycin indicated theH. longicornis rCHT1 is glycosylated (Fig. 5 A). The open reading frame of the CHT1 cDNA in the recombinant virus directs the synthesis of a 116-kDa protein larger than the predicted molecular mass of 104 kDa, implying that the H. longicornisrCHT1 undergoes posttranslational modification. Consistent with this are the observations that the mouse anti-rCHT1 serum in the presence of tunicamycin did not react with major constituent protein bands of 116 kDa in the media or the cells. Instead, mouse anti-rCHT1 serum detected a 107-kDa protein accumulating in the cells. Use of the enzymeN-glycosidase F is the most effective method of removing virtually all N-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins (40Tarentino A.L. Plummer T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 44-57Google Scholar). Fig. 5 B of N-glycosidase-treated CHT1 protein provides evidence that the CHT1 protein from the tunicamycin-treated cells of Fig. 5 A is deglycosylated. These results verify that H. longicornis rCHT1 withN-glycosylation sites is glycosylated. H. longicornis CHT1 possesses a chitin binding peritrophin A domain at amino acid residues 868–922 and 2 glycosyl hydrolase family 18 chitin binding domains at amino acid residues 44–389 and 471–817. These domains strongly suggest H. longicornis CHT1 plays an important role as a chitin hydrolase in the life cycle of ticks. The deduced amino acid sequence showed low homology to other reported chitinase sequences, such as Aedes aegypti(GenBankTM accession number T14075; 31% amino acid homology) by BLASTN (prediction of protein localization site) and MacVector Ver. 6.5 programs (sequence analysis software). Comparison of conserved regions in the amino acid sequences of chitinases revealedH. longicornis CHT1 has two pairs of conserved domains similar to those of A. aegypti chitinase (Fig.10). The low homology in chitinase sequences indicates a strong difference between species. Only the sequence of the actual catalytic center, region II (Fig. 10), which includes the amino acids Asp-164 and Asp-592 and Glu-168 and Glu-596 inH. longicornis CHT1, are highly conserved in all family 18 chitinases characterized so far. This catalytic center is indispensable for enzyme activity (41Watanabe T. Kobori K. Miyashita K. Fujii T. Sakai S. Uchida M. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18567-18572Google Scholar) and implies that H. longicornisCHT1 is a member of the family 18 chitinases. In vitro chitinase activity assay using the purified baculovirus-expressed rCHT1 showed chitin hydrolysis, indicating rCHT1 is a H. longicornis chitinase (Fig. 6). All family 18 chitinases are inhibited by allosamidin (13Spindler K.D. Spindler-Barth M. Jollès P. Muzzarelli R.A.A. Chitin and Chitinases. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1999: 201-209Google Scholar), and the activity of rCHT1 was inhibited by allosamidin (Fig. 6), indicating H. longicornis chitinase is a family 18 chitinase. Eosinophil chemotactic cytokine (ECF-L) possesses the CXC consensus sequence near the NH2 terminus. This is typical of CXC chemokines, and a comprehensive GenBankTMdata base search revealed the ECF-L is a chitinase family protein (42Owhashi M. Arita H. Hayai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1279-1286Google Scholar). In addition the functional role for the ELR motif in CXC chemokine-mediated angiogenesis has been observed (43Strieter R.M. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Arenberg D.A. Burdick M.D. Kasper J. Dzuiba J. Damme J.V. Walz A. Marriott D. Chan S.Y. Roczniak S. Shanafelt A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27348-27357Google Scholar). H. longicornis CHT1 has ELR motifs at amino acid residues 185–187 and 613–615. The purified rCHT1 showed a maximum activity at 45 °C and pH 5–7 (Fig. 7), such as seen in the chitinases of some insects (38Shinoda T. Kobayashi J. Matsui M. Chinzei Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 521-532Google Scholar, 44Zhu X. Zhang H. Fukamizo T. Muthukrishnan S. Kramer K.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 1221-1230Google Scholar). These results suggest that H. longicornischitinase is a member of the chemokine family. Chitinase is produced in molting fluid and gut tissues subsequent to feeding at the end of a larval instar in preparation for a molt (25Kramer K.J. Corpuz L.M. Choi H. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 691-701Google Scholar,45Fukamizo T. Kramer K.J. Insect Biochem. 1987; 17: 547-550Google Scholar). Examination of flat sections showed a strong reactivity in the cuticle epidermis and midgut of H. longicornis, illustrating the H. longicornis chitinase is abundantly expressed there (Fig. 8). The PM formed in the midgut lumen of blood-sucking arthropods after a blood meal (3Peters W. Bradshaw S.D. Burggren W. Heller H.C. Ishii S. Langer H. Neuweiler G. Randall D.J. Zoophysiology: Peritrophic Membranes. 130. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992Google Scholar, 5Richards A.G. Richards P.A. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1977; 22: 219-240Google Scholar) may act as a barrier for invasion of ingested microorganisms (46Huber M. Cabib E. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2807-2810Google Scholar). Chitin is a key structural component of the PM (3Peters W. Bradshaw S.D. Burggren W. Heller H.C. Ishii S. Langer H. Neuweiler G. Randall D.J. Zoophysiology: Peritrophic Membranes. 130. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992Google Scholar,47Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kasow D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Google Scholar). In support of this, gut specific chitinases have been found, and PM shown to be stronger and more persistent in the guts of mosquitoes fed chitinase inhibitors (47Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kasow D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Google Scholar, 48Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28895-28900Google Scholar). The existence of PM in ticks has been demonstrated morphologically with Babesia microtipassing through it in Ixodes ticks (49Rudzinska M.A. Spielman A. Lewengrub S. Piesman J. Karakashian S.

The appearance ofH. longicornis chitinase in the midgut (Fig. 8) suggests this chitinase may be involved in controlling turnover and porosity of the chitin-containing PM. The appearance of H. longicornischitinase in the cuticle epidermis (Fig. 8) implies it acts as a molting enzyme. These results indicate H. longicornischitinase is a very important enzyme for molting and control of turnover and porosity of the PM in ticks and, thus, is a major candidate as a bio-acaricide. Baculoviruses have long been attractive biological agents for control of crop pest insect. However, limitations of their use have been a very narrow host range and slow killing rate, resulting in significant crop damage. Recently, viruses with increased host range and improved virulence are being engineered (50Maeda S. Volrath S.L. Hanzlik T.N. Harper S.A. Majima K. Maddox D.W. Hammock B.D. Fowler E. Virology. 1991; 184: 777-780Google Scholar, 51Tomalski M.D. Miller L.K. Nature. 1991; 352: 82-85Google Scholar). S. frugiperda larvae injected with a transformed AcMNPV expressing M. sexta chitinase died more quickly than those injected with a wild type virus (24Gopalakrishnan B. Muthukrishnan S. Kramer K.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 255-265Google Scholar). In this study, H. longicornis became infected with AcMNPV·CHT1 (Fig. 9), and rCHT1 was replicated. This is the first report of infection with recombinant insect-baculoviruses in ticks. H. longicornis adults treated with high concentration of ACM died (data not shown) as with M. sexta chitinase (24Gopalakrishnan B. Muthukrishnan S. Kramer K.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 255-265Google Scholar). Therefore, AcMNPV·CHT1 is a candidate for a potential bio-acaricide. However, to facilitate the use of chitinases in an integrated pest management system as a new and highly selective approach to tick control we must gain much more knowledge. This study represents the first report of the cloning, identification, and characterization of a tick chitinase, expression of the cDNA in an insect baculovirus, demonstration of the ability of the purified baculovirus expressed rCHT1 to degrade chitin, localization of chitinase in the epidermis and midgut of ticks, and infection of ticks with a recombinant insect-baculovirus. Further studies exploring the usefulness of H. longicornis chitinase as a vaccine and novel bio-acaricide against ticks need to be investigated extensively. We thank Dr. Y.

https://openalex.org/W2071717387,"Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are bifunctional enzymes possessing lipid kinase activity and the capacity to phosphorylate their catalytic and/or regulatory subunits. In this study, in vitro autophosphorylation of the G protein-sensitive p85-coupled class IA PI3Kβ and p101-coupled class IB PI3Kγ was examined. Autophosphorylation sites of both PI3K isoforms were mapped to C-terminal serine residues of the catalytic p110 subunit (i.e. serine 1070 of p110β and serine 1101 of p110γ). Like other class IA PI3K isoforms, autophosphorylation of p110β resulted in down-regulated PI3Kβ lipid kinase activity. However, no inhibitory effect of p110γ autophosphorylation on PI3Kγ lipid kinase activity was observed. Moreover, PI3Kβ and PI3Kγ differed in the regulation of their autophosphorylation. Whereas p110β autophosphorylation was stimulated neither by Gβγ complexes nor by a phosphotyrosyl peptide derived from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, autophosphorylation of p110γ was significantly enhanced by Gβγ in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In summary, we show that autophosphorylation of both PI3Kβ and PI3Kγ occurs in a C-terminal region of the catalytic p110 subunit but differs in its regulation and possible functional consequences, suggesting distinct roles of autophosphorylation of PI3Kβ and PI3Kγ.

These lipid kinases phosphorylate the D3 position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides, thus generating intracellular lipid second messengers (1Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Google Scholar, 2Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Google Scholar). PtdIns, PtdIns-4-P, and PtdIns-4,5-P2are in vitro substrates of class I PI3Ks, although these enzymes predominantly produce PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 in vivo. Class I PI3K lipid products transmit signals by recruiting intracellular effector molecules to the membrane, which contain particular pleckstrin homology domain modules. Effectors include serine/threonine kinases like Akt/protein kinase B, Tec family tyrosine kinases, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors for monomeric GTP-binding proteins like Grp1 and Vav (3Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Google Scholar). Consequently, class I PI3Ks are involved in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular functions such as differentiation, proliferation, survival, migration, and metabolism (4Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Google Scholar, 5Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Google Scholar). All class I PI3Ks are heterodimers consisting of a p110 catalytic and a p85 or p101 type regulatory subunit. According to the type of their associated regulatory subunit, class I PI3Ks can be further distinguished. The class IA catalytic p110α, -β, and -δ subunits complex with adaptor molecules containing two Src homology 2 domains, of which p85 is the prototype. Through interaction of the adaptor Src homology 2 domains with phosphotyrosines, class IA PI3Ks are activated by receptor tyrosine kinases. In contrast, the only class IB member, p110γ, associates with a p101 regulatory subunit and is not recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases. PI3Kγ is regulated by G protein-coupled receptors through direct interaction with Gβγ complexes of heterotrimeric G proteins (6Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D.

Furthermore, class IA PI3Kβ is also sensitive to Gβγ and thus may function as a coincidence detector integrating tyrosine kinase- and G protein-dependent signals (10Kurosu H. Maehama T. Okada T.

In addition to their lipid kinase activity, all class I PI3Ks possess an intrinsic protein kinase activity in vitro (13Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 843-845Google Scholar). This enzymatic quality was first characterized as autophosphorylation of catalytic and regulatory subunits. PI3Kα phosphorylates its p85 adaptor subunit at serine 608, whereas autophosphorylation of PI3Kδ occurs at serine 1039 of the catalytic p110δ subunit. Both phosphorylations result in down-regulation of the lipid kinase activity (14Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K.

Moreover, in Jurkat T cells, p110δ phosphorylation was stimulated by CD28 in vivo (15Vanhaesebroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S. Brennan P. Ward S.G. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Google Scholar). There is some in vitro evidence that class IA PI3Ks can phosphorylate other substrates such as the insulin receptor substrate-1 adaptor protein and PDE3B, but the physiological significance of these phosphorylations remains unknown (17Lam K.

Recently it was reported that a “protein kinase-only” mutant of the G-protein-regulated PI3Kγ still activated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in cells, whereas no activation of Akt/protein kinase B by this mutant occurred (22Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of both catalytic and regulatory subunits of PI3Kβ and PI3Kγ has been proposed, but many questions regarding the autophosphorylation sites and the functional relevance of these autophosphorylation events remain unanswered. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the in vitro autophosphorylation of the G protein-sensitive class I PI3Kβ and PI3Kγ. Recombinant heterodimeric PI3Ks were purified and analyzed for their autophosphorylation. Phosphorylated amino acids were identified, and the effect of autophosphorylation on PI3K lipid kinase activity was studied. Interestingly, we observed significant differences in the regulation and functional consequences of the autophosphorylation of PI3Kβ and PI3Kγ. Construction and characterization of recombinant baculoviruses for expression of GST-p110α, p110γ, GST-p110γ, GST-p110γK833R, GST-p101, p101, and p85α were described previously (6Stoyanov B.

A pFastBacHTa baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen) was used to generate His-p110β and His-p110γ full-length constructs using NcoI/SalI andNcoI/BamHI cloning sites, respectively. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides for generation of p110βS1070 mutants (mutated residues are underlined) were as follows: 5′-GGA AAG ACT ACA GAG CTT AAG CTG CAG TCG-3′ and 5′-CGA CTG CAG CTT AAGCTC TGT AGT CTT TCC-3′ (for S1070A), 5′-GGA AAG ACT ACA GAGATT AAG CTG CAG TCG-3′ and 5′-CGA CTG CAG CTT AATCTC TGT AGT CTT TCC-3′ (for S1070D), and 5′-GGA AAG ACT ACA GAG A GT AAG CTG CAG TCG-3′ and 5′-CGA CTG CAG CTT ACTCTC TGT AGT CTT TCC-3′ (for S1070E).

Recombinant viruses expressing hexahistidine-tagged p110β, p110γ, and mutants thereof were generated using the Bac-to-Bac Expression System (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Expression and purification of PI3K isoforms were carried out according to published protocols (11Maier U. Babich A. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Google Scholar) with the exception that the partially purified proteins were subjected to an additional chromatographic step on a 1-ml Resource Q fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). For that purpose, proteins were diluted in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto the column. The column was subsequently washed with buffer A, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in buffer A. Expression and purification of recombinant Gβ1γ2-His complexes was carried out as published (11Maier U. Babich A. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Google Scholar). Purified proteins were quantified by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE with bovine serum albumin as the standard (23Exner T. Nürnberg B. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 108-110Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide used in this study, CGGpYMDMSKDESVDpYVPMLDM (where pY represents phosphotyrosine), was derived from the human platelet-derived growth factor receptor (24Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-89Google Scholar) and kindly donated by Dr. Andreas Steinmeyer (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany). A nonphosphorylated peptide served as a control and had no effect on PI3K enzymatic activity. The peptides derived from the C termini of p110β and p110γ (WMAHTVRKDYRS and WFLHLVLGIKQGEKHSA, respectively) were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Beyermann (Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany). HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Subconfluent cells were transfected in 3-cm dishes with pcDNA3-fMLP receptor (0.2 μg), pcDNA3-p101 (0.4 μg), and pcDNA3-p110γ (0.4 μg) variants, using the FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. For preparation of whole cell lysates, cells were directly lysed in sample buffer according to Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Characterization of the monoclonal antibody against p110γ has been described elsewhere (7Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs. Whole cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Visualization of specific antisera was performed using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro lipid kinase activity was determined basically as described previously (11Maier U. Babich A. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Google Scholar). In brief, assays were conducted in a final volume of 50 μl, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmEDTA, 7 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate (vesicle buffer) with some modifications. Lipid vesicles (30 μl containing 320 μmphosphatidylethanolamine, 300 μm phosphatidylserine, 140 μm phosphatidylcholine, 30 μmsphingomyelin, and 40 μm PtdIns-4,5-P2 in vesicle buffer) were mixed with stimuli as indicated and incubated on ice for 10 min. It should be noted that we ensured that the effects of Gβγ on PI3K activity were not affected by their detergent-containing vehicles. Thereafter, the enzyme (20–100 ng of PI3Kβ or 2–10 ng of PI3Kγ) was added, and the mixture was incubated for further 10 min at 4 °C in a final volume of 40 μl. The assay was started by adding 40 μm ATP (1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 10 μl of vesicle buffer. After an incubation period of 15 min (unless otherwise stated) at 36 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of ice-cold 1 n HCl, and lipids were extracted with 450 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). Following centrifugation, the organic phase was washed twice with 150 μl of 1 n HCl. Subsequently, 40 μl of the organic phase were resolved on potassium oxalate-pretreated TLC plates (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) using a mixture of 35 ml of 2 n acetic acid and 65 ml ofn-propyl alcohol as the mobile phase. Dried TLC plates were exposed to Fuji imaging plates, and autoradiographic signals were quantitated with a BAS 1500 Fuji-Imager (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). In vitro protein kinase activity was determined as described for the lipid kinase activity with some modifications. The assay volume was 25 μl (2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/tube), the vesicle buffer contained 0–10 mm MgCl2 and/or 0–10 mmMnCl2 as indicated, and lipid vesicles lacked PtdIns-4,5-P2. The reaction was stopped after an incubation period of 30 min (unless otherwise stated) at 36 °C by adding 10 μl of 4× sample buffer according to Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Following separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Dried membranes were exposed to Fuji imaging plates, and autoradiographic signals were quantitated. For the determination of PI3K autophosphorylation sites, 20–50 μg of PI3Kβ or PI3Kγ were phosphorylated in a final volume of 1,500 μl. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Calculation of the stoichiometry of p110 autophosphorylation was based on the specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP incorporated into p110, and counts were determined by Cerenkov counting. The amount of p110 was estimated from the Coomassie-stained gel by comparison with stained bovine serum albumin standards. Autophosphorylated PI3Kγ was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.), and the phosphorylated p110γ band was excised. The protein was hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The sample was vacuum-dried, and amino acids were resuspended in 5 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (0.078% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.025% (v/v) formic acid) containing 2 μg each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine as internal standards. The sample was applied to a cellulose thin layer plate, and electrophoresis in the first dimension was carried out in pH 1.9 buffer at 550 V for 1 h. After drying the plate, an electrophoretic separation in the second dimension was carried out in pH 3.5 buffer (0.05% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.005% (v/v) pyridine, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 500 V for 50 min. The unlabeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by spraying the plate with 0.2% (w/v) ninhydrin in acetone, and the radiolabeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. Gel-excised autophosphorylated p110 spots (100–150 pmol) were washed with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, shrunk by dehydration in acetonitrile, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Disulfide bonds were reduced by incubation with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 45 min at 55 °C. Alkylation was performed by replacing the dithiothreitol solution with 55 mmiodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Following a 20-min incubation period at 25 °C in the dark, the gel pieces were washed with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, shrunk by dehydration in acetonitrile, and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The gel pieces were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate, containing 1 μg of chymotrypsin (sequencing grade; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), for p110γ or at room temperature in 50% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, containing 10 mg/ml cyanogen bromide, for p110β. To extract the peptides, 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile was added, and the separated liquid was dried under vacuum, redissolved in 5 μl of buffer B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid), and loaded onto a Vydac C18 column (150 × 1 mm, 5 μm, type 218 TP 5115) for micro-liquid chromatography separation. Elution was performed using a linear gradient of 5–80% buffer C in 60 min at an eluent flow rate of 30 μl/min. Buffer C was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile/water (8:2, v/v), containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Fractions were collected, their radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting, and phosphopeptides were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). MALDI-MS measurements were performed on a Voyager-DE STR BioSpectrometry work station MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. The program FindMod (available on the World Wide Web at expasy.ch/tools/findmod) was used to interpret the MS spectra of protein digests. Amino acid sequences of the phosphopeptides were determined by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS/MS). The liquid chromatography fractions were lyophilized and redissolved in 5 μl of 1% (v/v) formic acid in methanol/water (1:1, v/v). The MS/MS measurements were performed with a nanoelectrospray hybrid quadrupole mass spectrometer Q-TOF (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The collision gas was argon at a pressure of 6.0 × 10−5 millibar in the collision cell. Class IA PI3Kα and PI3Kδ isoforms phosphorylate either their p85 adaptor subunit and/or the catalytic p110 subunit itself (14Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F.

Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of p110δ occurs on serine 1039 within the C terminus. Alignment of the C termini of class IA catalytic subunits shows that p110α, which does not autophosphorylate, contains no C-terminal serine, whereas p110β does have one (serine 1070) (Fig.1 A). Recent reports have described autophosphorylation of both subunits of PI3Kβ (i.e. p85 and p110β) (25Roche S. Downward J. Raynal P. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7119-7129Google Scholar, 26Beeton C.A. Chance E.M. Foukas L.C. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 353-359Google Scholar, 27Yart A. Roche S. Wetzker R. Laffargue M. Tonks N. Mayeux P. Chap H. Raynal P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21167-21178Google Scholar). In order to analyze autophosphorylation of PI3K isoforms in vitro, we expressed recombinant heterodimeric PI3Kα and PI3Kβ in insect cells and measured their protein kinase activities (Fig. 1 B). As anticipated, the p85 adaptor of PI3Kα was phosphorylated in the presence of Mn2+ only (see Fig. 1 B, left panel). In contrast to p110α, p110β autophosphorylated its catalytic subunit. This autophosphorylation of p110β was also largely Mn2+-dependent, since in vitrophosphorylation levels in the presence of Mg2+ reached a maximum of only 5–10% compared with the level observed in the presence of Mn2+ (see Fig. 1 B, right panel). Furthermore, in the presence of Mn2+, a small but significant phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3Kβ was evident. These data indicate that both subunits are phosphorylated, with p110β being the main substrate of PI3Kβ autophosphorylation. Speculating that p110β autophosphorylates its C terminus, the in vitro phosphorylated and [32P]phosphate-labeled protein (Fig.2 A) was cleaved with cyanogen bromide in order to generate a C-terminal peptide, which was then analyzed by mass spectrometry. The resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC, and the radioactivity of each fraction was determined. The main radioactive fraction was examined by MALDI-MS, and a peptide corresponding to the phosphorylated C terminus of p110β (m/z 1312.65) could be identified (Fig. 2 B). Sequencing of this phosphopeptide by nanoESI-MS/MS revealed the1061AHTVRKDYRpS1070 (where pS represents phosphoserine) sequence of p110β and serine 1070 as the site of autophosphorylation (Table I). In order to verify this finding, a p110β mutant in which serine 1070 was changed to alanine was created, and autophosphorylation of this mutant was compared with the wild-type enzyme in the presence of Mn2+. Fig. 2 C shows that no significant phosphate incorporation into the mutant p110βS1070A of PI3Kβ took place while this mutant was still catalytically active as a lipid kinase (see below). Hence, results obtained by mass spectrometric and mutagenic analysis demonstrate that serine 1070 represents in fact the main site of autophosphorylation in p110β.Table IMS/MS fragment ions of the p110β C-terminal phosphopeptidem/zLoss of neutral H3PO4y“ iony3“505.18407.20y7“1003.47905.50y8“1104.521006.54y9“1241.581143.60b ionb2209.10b3310.15b5565.32b6693.42b7808.44b8971.51b91127.61b101294.611196.63The triple-charged precursor ion with m/z 438.22 of the phosphopeptide 1061AHTVRKDYRpS1070 was sequenced by nanoESI-MS/MS.

Both phosphorylation of the p85 adaptor by p110α and autophosphorylation of p110δ down-regulate the enzymes' lipid kinase activities (14Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I.

In order to test this assumption, we measured lipid kinase activities of p110β variants in which serine 1070 was mutated. Since the lipid kinase activity of PI3Kβ can be synergistically stimulated by Gβγ complexes and a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide derived from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, we measured formation of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 under basal conditions and after stimulation of PI3Kβ variants with either stimuli in the presence of Mg2+ (11Maier U. Babich A. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Google Scholar). Wild-type p110β and the nonphosphorylating p110βS1070A mutant exhibited the same enzymatic activity under basal conditions and after stimulation with Gβγ, phosphotyrosyl peptide, or both stimuli (Fig. 2 D). This finding indicates that serine 1070 is not essential for the catalytic activity of p110β. However, purified mutant PI3Kβ heterodimers are less stable than the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). In order to mimic the effects of p110β autophosphorylation, mutants of p110β containing the negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acid instead of serine 1070 were employed. These p110βS1070D/E mutants no longer autophosphorylated (data not shown). Moreover, as shown in Fig.2 D, the lipid kinase activity of either p110βS1070D/E mutant was reduced by 4–7-fold under basal conditions and following stimulation with Gβγ and phosphotyrosyl peptides. This implies a regulatory function of the p110β autophosphorylation. Next we created a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of p110β (WMAHTVRKDYRS) as a pseudosubstrate in order to test whether the protein kinase activity of the autophosphorylated p110β was still intact. Applying mass spectrometry, no phosphorylation of this peptide by wild-type PI3Kβ was observed (data not shown). Moreover, as indicated in Fig. 2 E, increased amounts of the C-terminal peptide did not influence the autophosphorylation of p110β by competition. Therefore, we assume that protein phosphorylation by PI3Kβ requires highly specific protein-protein interactions, and due to the lack of appropriate substrates the effect of p110β autophosphorylation on the protein kinase activity of the enzyme remains unknown so far. The finding that autophosphorylation of p110β on serine 1070 results in down-regulation of the lipid kinase activity of PI3Kβ (see Fig.2 D) suggests a regulatory function of this autophosphorylation. Therefore, one may suppose that the protein kinase activity like the lipid kinase activity of PI3Kβ is controlled by cell surface receptors. In order to address this hypothesis, we compared both kinase activities after incubation of PI3Kβ with increasing concentrations of Gβγ complexes and the tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide. As indicated, Fig.3, A and B, shows that the lipid kinase activity of PI3Kβ was stimulated in a concentration-dependent manner by Gβγ (EC50= 20 nm) or phosphotyrosyl peptide (EC50 = 5 nm). In contrast, neither Gβγ nor phosphotyrosyl peptide stimulated p110β autophosphorylation (see Fig. 3,A and B). Moreover, a combination of both stimuli led to"

Here, we present an analysis of heterogeneity in KatG heme structure using optical, resonance Raman, and EPR spectroscopy. Examination of ferric KatG under a variety of conditions, including enzyme in the presence of fluoride, chloride, or isoniazid, and at different stages during purification in different buffers allowed for assignment of spectral features to both five- and six-coordinate heme.

Quantum mechanically mixed spin heme is the most abundant form in such partially purified enzyme. Reduction and reoxidation of six-coordinate KatG or the addition of glycerol or isoniazid restored five-coordinate heme iron, consistent with displacement of a weakly bound distal water molecule. The rate of formation of KatG Compound I is not retarded by the presence of six-coordinate heme either in wild-type KatG or in a mutant (KatG[Y155S]) associated with isoniazid resistance, which contains abundant six-coordinate heme.

Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 177-182Google Scholar). These enzymes fall into the category of Class I peroxidases, according to the system used by Welinder based on polypeptide structural parameters (2Welinder K.G. Mauro J.M. Norskov-Lauritsen L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 337-340Google Scholar). In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, KatG is important for virulence due to its role in oxidative stress management (3Collins D.M. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 426-430Google Scholar, 4Pym A.S. Domenech P. Honore N. Song J. Deretic V. Cole S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 879-889Google Scholar). KatG is also responsible for activation of the pro-drug isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide) (5Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Google Scholar, 6Zhang Y. Garbe T. Young D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 521-524Google Scholar, 7Heym B. Cole S.T. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 1997; 8: 61-70Google Scholar), which has been in continual use since the early 1950s to treat tuberculosis infection (8Robitzek E.H. Selikoff I.J. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1952; 65: 402-410Google Scholar). The mode of action of this old antibiotic is of current interest especially in the context of INH resistance mechanisms in clinically isolated strains, which appeared not long after TB therapy with this drug began (9Middlebrook G. Cohn M.L. Schaeffer W.B. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1954; 70: 852-872Google Scholar). Various mutations in the gene (katG) that encodes this protein have more recently been correlated with drug resistance (10Musser J.M. Kapur V. Williams D.L. Kreiswirth B.N. van Soolingen D. van Embden J.D. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 173: 196-202Google Scholar, 11Rouse D.A. DeVito J.A. Li Z. Byer H. Morris S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 583-592Google Scholar), although identification of the structural or functional defects in the mutant enzymes remains underexplored. The elucidation of altered drug binding, altered heme binding, or other structural changes due to amino acid substitutions is only in very early stages of detailed study, most of which has been devoted to the commonly encountered mutant KatG[S315T] (12Lukat-Rodgers G.S.

Altered drug binding may be an important factor in drug resistance (18Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Google Scholar), rather than major changes in the enzyme's activity as a catalase or peroxidase, although other mechanisms have been put forth, including effects involving superoxide-initiated reactions (19Wengenack N.L. Hoard H.M. Rusnak F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9748-9749Google Scholar). Although catalase-peroxidases from various microorganisms have been purified and characterized, the relationship between the catalytic function of wild type or mutant enzymes and the heme structural features such as coordination number or spin state has not been defined. Understanding such relationships is required if drug resistance mechanisms in the growing number of mutant KatG enzymes are to be characterized. Spectroscopic characterization of recombinantM. tuberculosis KatG and mutant S315T reported elsewhere showed that the purified enzyme contained a mixture of five-coordinate (5-c) and six-coordinate (6-c) high spin (HS) heme iron as well as a large component of low spin (LS) heme (12Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Wengenack N.L. Rusnak F. Rodgers K.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9984-9993Google Scholar). Our earlier results (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Google Scholar) suggested that the majority heme iron species in purified overexpressedM. tuberculosis KatG was the 5-c HS form. A recent report on overexpressed KatG from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis(21Heering H.A. Indiani C. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9237-9247Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of 5-c HS and 6-c high and low spin heme iron in this enzyme. In the present investigation, optical, resonance Raman, and EPR spectroscopy were used to investigate the heterogeneity of heme iron species in wild type M. tuberculosis KatG and two mutants (S315T and Y155S), both identified as drug-resistant mutants (11Rouse D.A.

Our results reveal that a 5-c heme form of KatG may be isolated but that coordination and spin state changes are unavoidable during handling of the enzyme under a variety of conditions. Similar issues have appeared in the literature over the years concerning yeast CCP (25Smulevich G. Evangelista-Kirkup R. English A. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4426-4430Google Scholar, 26Yonetani T. Anni H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9547-9554Google Scholar, 27Vitello L.B. Huang M. Erman J.E.

The initiation of the peroxidase cycle, evaluated by determination of the rate of formation of Compound I, is not altered greatly for wild-type KatG samples varying in their content of 6-c heme iron. In KatG[Y155S], formation of 6-c HS heme is facilitated and predominates in the purified enzyme, although it is not inhibited compared with wild-type KatG in its rate of Compound I formation either. Interestingly, this mutation causes a significant change in heme structure in the pure enzyme, whereas the common mutation S315T found in INH-resistant bacteria does not. E. coli UM262 (pKAT II) (overexpression system containing M. tuberculosis katG gene) was a gift from Stewart Cole (Institut Pasteur, Paris). Mutagenesis was performed as reported elsewhere (18Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Google Scholar). All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Commercial peroxyacetic acid contains hydrogen peroxide, which was removed by incubation of PAA (10 mm) for 1 h with bovine liver catalase (780 units/ml) in 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.2, followed by removal of the enzyme by ultrafiltration. KatG was isolated and purified from E. coli strain UM262 (katG minus) expressing the M. tuberculosis katG gene or a mutated gene for preparation of KatG[Y155S] and KatG[S315T]. The bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μm) plus the heme biosynthetic precursor, δ-aminolevulinic acid (300 μm), which eliminated the large proportion of heme-deficient enzyme isolated in its absence. Cells were cultured for various time periods (routinely 6–8 h and up to 20 h, as indicated). The enzyme was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography according to a published procedure (29Marcinkeviciene J.A. Magliozzo R.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22290-22295Google Scholar), using either 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) or 20 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.8) (TEA-Cl). Sodium chloride gradients were generally used for enzyme elution from ion exchange media (Amersham Biosciences Q-Sepharose FastFlow, MonoQ), whereas ammonium sulfate from 1 m down to 0 m was used in the gradient for elution of KatG from phenyl-Sepharose media (Amersham Biosciences phenyl-Sepharose). Optical spectroscopy was performed using a model NT14 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) interfaced to a personal computer running 14DS software. All spectra were recorded for enzyme in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 25 °C, except where noted otherwise. Solid sodium chloride, fluoride, or formate was added in large excess (up to 1 m) to solutions of KatG for examination of spectroscopic changes. Ferric KatG-NO was prepared by exposing the enzyme to NO gas under anaerobic conditions, monitoring the complete formation of the complex according to optical features (Soret at 420 nm, α and β bands at 570 and 536 nm). No evidence for reduction to the ferrous enzyme was found under these conditions. Reduction of KatG samples containing a high proportion of 6-c heme, using a small excess of sodium dithionite under anaerobic conditions, led to the formation of ferrous KatG (confirmed according to its optical spectrum (29Marcinkeviciene J.A. Magliozzo R.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22290-22295Google Scholar, 30Johnsson K. Froland W.A. Schultz P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2834-2840Google Scholar)). Exposure to air immediately converted ferrous KatG to the ferric enzyme, based on optical spectra (29Marcinkeviciene J.A. Magliozzo R.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22290-22295Google Scholar). Recovery of 5-c enzyme was also attempted by adding glycerol (60%) to KatG in phosphate buffer (31Smulevich G. Mantini A.R. English A.M. Mauro J.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5058-5064Google Scholar,32Pond A.E. Sono M. Elenkova E.A. McRee D.E. Goodin D.B. English A.M. Dawson J.H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 76: 165-174Google Scholar) or by titration with isoniazid. Reconstitution of heme-deficient KatG yielded a mixture of specifically and nonspecifically bound heme (both 6-c and 5-c), and this technique was not pursued for evaluation of structural changes in the enzyme. Low temperature (5–6 K) EPR spectra were obtained at X-band using a Varian E-12 spectrometer interfaced to a personal computer and equipped with a liquid helium cryostat and Heli-Tran liquid helium transfer system (Advanced Research Systems, Inc., Allentown, PA). Data acquisition made use of WinEPR software (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Google Scholar). Assignment of g values was accomplished using difference spectra and/or simulation for a large collection of spectra recorded under varying conditions of pH, temperature, and/or microwave power. In this way, the gy and gx partners could be isolated when multiple signals were present. Quantitative EPR of low spin heme (based on signal intensity of one rhombic low spin heme species) was performed by double integration of signals recorded at 42 K, using the LS myoglobin-mercaptoethanol complex as a spin standard. This sample was prepared from commercial ferric horse heart myoglobin in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, by the addition of 1% β-mercaptoethanol (33Magliozzo R.S. Peisach J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8446-8456Google Scholar). Final heme concentration in the standard was based on the Soret absorbance of the starting aquometmyoglobin (34Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar), assuming complete conversion to the LS form. Resonance Raman spectra were obtained using a single spectrograph (TriAx 550; JY/Horiba) and a liquid N2-cooled CCD detector (Spectrum One; JY/Horiba) with a UV-enhanced 2048 × 512-pixel chip (EEV). The Rayleigh scattering was removed using a 406.7-nm holographic notch filter (Kaiser Optical). The samples were excited with the 406.7 nm line from a Kr+ laser (Coherent, I-302). Samples were placed in a spinning cell under an N2 atmosphere and kept at 6 ± 2 °C during the experiments. Enzyme concentration was 40 μm, and the laser power incident on the sample was 10 mW. Background correction of spectra was performed by subtracting a polynomial function from the data. The vibrational modes were labeled according to Ref. 35Abe M. Kitagawa T. Kyogoku Y. J. Chem. Phys. 1978; 69: 4526-4534Google Scholar, and the modes were assigned following published analyses (36Choi S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 3683-3692Google Scholar, 37Choi S. Lee J.J. Wei Y.H. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 3692-3707Google Scholar). To determine relative peak intensities and positions, a curve-fitting program was used to simulate experimental spectra using Lorentzian line shapes. A bandwidth of 13.5 cm−1 was used for the simulation of the ν3region bands. The formation of KatG Compound I was followed as previously described using a HiTech Scientific model SF-61DX2 stopped-flow instrument equipped with a rapid scanning diode array spectrophotometer and Kinet-Asyst software for data acquisition and analysis (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Google Scholar). All reactions were thermostated at 25 °C. In a typical reaction, 10 μm KatG was mixed with PAA (10 μm to 1 mm) in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Second order rate constants for Compound I formation were determined based on absorbance changes in the Soret region (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of M. tuberculosis KatG isolated and fully purified in TEA-Cl 2TEA and other cationic amine buffers are recommended for use with strong anion exchangers such as FastFlow Q-Sepharose and MonoQ (Amersham Biosciences). for this work is characterized by a Soret peak at 408 nm and a CT1 band at 629 nm (TableI), as reported previously (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Google Scholar). Other features of the spectrum, which are not discussed further, include a shoulder near 545 nm and a maximum at 505 nm (the β and CT2 bands, respectively). The wavelength maxima for the Soret and CT1 bands are very close to those reported elsewhere for overexpressed M. tuberculosis KatG prepared in other buffers, either at pH 7.0 or 8.0 (15Wengenack N.L. Todorovic S. Yu L. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15825-15834Google Scholar, 30Johnsson K. Froland W.A. Schultz P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2834-2840Google Scholar, 38Hillar A. Loewen P.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 438-446Google Scholar). These maxima, which are most often associated with 6-c heme in peroxidases, however, were found to be notably different from those seen early in the KatG purification protocol, an observation suggesting that published spectra did not represent “native” KatG and that a more detailed investigation was warranted.Table IAbsorption maxima in the optical spectrum of M. tuberculosis KatG after each step in the purification protocolAbsorption maximaSoretCT1nmTEA-Cl buffer (20 mm, pH 7.8)Step 1aStep 1, enzyme collected from first anion exchange chromatography; 2, enzyme collected from phenyl-Sepharose chromatography using reverse ammonium sulfate gradient; 3, enzyme collected from second anion exchange chromatography.

Whereas the purity of the enzyme varies throughout purification, our approach, in which the enzyme was monitored from the first through the last chromatographic procedure, was considered viable, since KatG always represented the majority protein (according to SDS-PAGE, not shown). Table I summarizes the optical wavelength maxima for KatG recovered and examined during and after purification. The spectrum of the enzyme changes significantly during purification in TEA but much less so in phosphate buffer. 3The major change in optical features occurred as a result of ammonium sulfate precipitation in this buffer but not in potassium phosphate buffer. Direct titration of the enzyme in potassium phosphate buffer with ammonium sulfate to 1 m (23%) did not cause any change in the optical spectrum. Catalytic reactions stimulated in the presence of amine-containing buffer may be partly responsible for these changes, as reported for CCP (39Anni H. Yonetani T. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 274: 437-449Google Scholar). Enzyme having a Soret peak at or near 405 nm with a shoulder at 380 nm and a CT1 band at or above 640 nm may be considered to represent mainly 5-c HS heme, whereas peaks at 408 and 630 nm indicate abundant 6-c HS heme. The purity index (A Soret/A 280) for KatG prepared in TEA-Cl was 0.65–0.7, whereas for KatG prepared in potassium phosphate buffer, the ratio was consistently lower (0.47–0.5). This observation is not due to differences in purity but demonstrates the greater abundance of 6-c heme when TEA buffer is used. A greater Soret extinction coefficient occurs for 6-c HS heme, as noted, for example, in CCP (32Pond A.E. Sono M. Elenkova E.A. McRee D.E. Goodin D.B. English A.M. Dawson J.H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 76: 165-174Google Scholar). Also given (Table II) are absorbance ratios in the Soret and CT1 band region that vary with the proportion of 6-c, relative to 5-c heme. For these ratios, higher values correspond to greater abundance of 6-c HS heme (27Vitello L.B. Huang M. Erman J.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4283-4288Google Scholar).Table IIAbsorption maxima and optical ratios sensitive to coordination state in various forms of M. tuberculosis KatGKatG formAbsorption λmaxA 404/A 380A 614/A 645nmFresh (partially purified)380,aShoulder.404, 642–6451.190.90Pure380, 405, 6421.440.92After storage (AS)408, 6301.721.02AS reduced/reoxidized380, 405, 6421.430.85AS + 60% glycerol380, 405, 6401.440.92a Shoulder. Open table in a new tab Close inspection of the CT1 band for the fresh enzyme after the first chromatography protocol during numerous preparations provided evidence that the enzyme even at this stage could be a mixture of at least two components, since shoulders red- and blue-shifted from 640 nm could occasionally be seen (not shown). In order to evaluate the stability of 5-c heme in KatG, the enzyme recovered after partial purification (step 1) in potassium phosphate buffer was stored for 3 weeks at 4 °C. During this time, the proportion of 6-c HS enzyme increased (Fig.1 and Table II), and higherA 404/A 380 andA 614/A 645 ratios were found. We wanted to ensure that the length of the period for bacterial overexpression of KatG had not allowed changes in structure before isolation of the enzyme. To address this issue, we compared partially purified (step 1) KatG isolated from cells grown for 6 or 20 h after induction of enzyme overexpression. No differences in optical spectra were found following elution from the first chromatographic column (not shown). This result demonstrates that if any structural changes occur during overexpression, they do not continue during the extended period from 6 to 20 h. For this reason, we suggest that the characteristics of the fresh, partially purified enzyme represent or closely resemble a “native” structure. In order to determine whether 6-c heme could be converted back to a 5-c form, we evaluated the effects of reducing and reoxidizing KatG, the effect of glycerol, and the effect of organic ligand binding. The first approach was based on the behavior of certain reversibly formed 6-c LS hemichromes identified in hemoglobin that can be converted back to high spin methemoglobin by reduction/reoxidation (40Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Kampa L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 934-939Google Scholar). Glycerol has been shown to modify the coordination state of heme iron in CCP (31Smulevich G. Mantini A.R. English A.M. Mauro J.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5058-5064Google Scholar, 32Pond A.E. Sono M. Elenkova E.A. McRee D.E. Goodin D.B. English A.M. Dawson J.H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 76: 165-174Google Scholar). For KatG, these two methods produced changes in optical spectra indicating conversion toward 5-c enzyme (Fig. 1, Table II). The reoxidation results also demonstrate the instability of KatG Compound III (oxyferrous KatG) as reported previously based on optical stopped-flow kinetic measurements (20Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Google Scholar), in which it had been generated from the ferric enzyme in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (31Smulevich G. Mantini A.R. English A.M. Mauro J.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5058-5064Google Scholar). The addition of INH and analogous ligands to 6-c KatG regenerated 5-c enzyme (not shown), confirming earlier reports (15Wengenack N.L. Todorovic S. Yu L. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15825-15834Google Scholar, 18Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Google Scholar). Overnight dialysis to remove INH restored the spectrum of the starting, 6-c enzyme. No optical changes were detected when INH was added to the fresh, partially purified enzyme. Whereas formation of 6-c heme due to water coordination under different conditions was considered the most likely origin of the heterogeneity in KatG heme structure, the potential formation of a 6-c KatG-chloride complex during purification was also investigated. Chloride binding to heme iron was considered possible because it is used in a relatively high concentration (0.3 m) to elute the enzyme from ion exchange media, and chloride binding to heme iron in CCP has been reported (26Yonetani T. Anni H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9547-9554Google Scholar). However, no significant differences were found in the optical spectrum of KatG when the first chromatography procedure was performed using a potassium phosphate concentration gradient (at pH 6.5) in place of the usual sodium chloride gradient for protein elution (not shown). This demonstrates that exposure of the enzyme to 0.3m sodium chloride for periods of 20–24 h does not produce heme structural changes. This also suggests that the enzyme eluted from the first column can be assigned to a “native” form with more confidence. We then deliberately attempted to produce a chloride complex in fresh partially purified KatG using higher concentrations of sodium chloride (1m). 4Optical changes with chloride, fluoride, and formate addition to KatG were very slow. A very high concentration of these ligands was used to effect optical changes in a reasonable time frame and to achieve maximal conversion of the enzyme into a new form. Here, a Soret peak at 408 nm without the shoulder at 380 nm, a new shoulder around 358 nm, and a CT1 band at 640 nm (Fig.2) were found. Whereas the changes in optical features suggest formation of 6-c iron, the shift in the CT1 band is a small fraction of that seen for 6-c HS KatG anion complexes (KatG-fluoride or KatG-formate (Table IIIand Fig. 2), and only a small shift in the Soret band occurred. For comparison, in CCP plus chloride, the Soret peak occurs at 413 nm, and the CT1 band occurs at 640 nm (26Yonetani T. Anni H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9547-9554Google Scholar).Table IIIAbsorption maxima of fresh partially purified KatG in the presence of weak field ligandsAbsorbance maximaSoretCT1nmKatG405aWith a shoulder at 380 nm.642–645+ NaCl408640+ NaF405615, 650+ CHOONa406615a With a shoulder at 380 nm. Open table in a new tab Fluoride binding to fresh, partially purified enzyme was also examined. Interestingly, two CT1 bands are found in the optical spectrum, one around 615 nm (typical of 6-c HS anion complexes) and another close to 650 nm (Fig. 2, inset). In contrast to this, the KatG-fluoride complex prepared under the same conditions, using KatG that contained abundant 6-c heme, exhibited a single CT1 band at 616 nm (not shown). These results are consistent with a low affinity for fluoride in enzyme that lacks a specific water molecule in the distal pocket required for stabilization of the ligand (41Howes B.D. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1532-1543Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the amount of LS iron in KatG, we used optical difference spectroscopy (and EPR presented below) based on the report of an endogenous LS KatG form exhibiting peaks at 540 and 570 nm (12Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Wengenack N.L. Rusnak F. Rodgers K.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9984-9993Google Scholar). No new maxima could be detected between 530 and 580 nm in difference spectra recorded for enzyme containing abundant 5-c versus6-c heme (data not shown). We also examined the first derivative of the optical spectrum of pure KatG and did not identify features indicating the presence of bands due to LS iron. Furthermore, the well formed CT1 band and the ratio of absorbances at 570 nm compared with 640 nm in the optical spectrum of KatG argue against the presence of LS heme in the pure enzyme. This ratio correlates well with the relative abundance of 6-c LS heme according to inspection of the data forSynechocystis KatG, CCP, and ascorbate peroxidase presented in Ref. 21Heering H.A. Indiani C. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9237-9247Google Scholar. Also, when LS heme is abundant enough to contribute a feature near 570 nm in spectra of these Class I peroxidases, the Soret peak is usually found at or above 410 nm (12Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Wengenack N.L. Rusnak F. Rodgers K.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9984-9993Google Scholar, 21Heering H.A. Indiani C. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Smulevich G.

https://openalex.org/W2027406306,"Malignant astrocytomas are common human primary brain tumors that result from neoplastic transformation of astroglia or their progenitors. Here we show that deregulation of the c-Myc pathway in developing astroglia predisposes mice to malignant astrocytomas within 2–3 weeks of age. The genetically engineered murine (GEM) gliomas harbor a molecular signature resembling that of human primary glioblastoma multiforme, including up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor and Mdm2. The GEM gliomas seem to originate in an abnormal population of glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing cells in the ventricular zone and, analogous to human glioblastomas, exhibit molecular and morphological heterogeneity. Levels of connexin 43 in the majority of the tumors are unaltered from normal tissue, indicating that GEM tumors have retained the capacity to establish syncytial networks. In line with this, individual glioma foci are composed of a mixture of actively proliferating cells expressing c-Myc and proliferating cell nuclear antigen and less dividing bystander cells that express glial fibrillary acidic protein and the broad complex tramtrack bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger domain protein HOF. A subset of the transgenic mice harbored, in addition to brain tumors, vestigial cerebellums in which granule cell migration and radial Bergman glial cell differentiation were disturbed. These observations argue for a window of vulnerability during astrocyte development where c-Myc overexpression is sufficient to trigger the neoplastic process, presumably by inducing the sustained growth of early astroglial cells. This is in contrast to most other transgenic studies in which c-Myc overexpression requires co-operating transgenes for rapid tumor induction.

They range from slow growing pilocytic astrocytomas to high grade variants such as anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastoma multiforme (1DeAngelis L.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 114-123Google Scholar, 2Louis D.N. Pomeroy S.L. Cairncross J.G. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 125-128Google Scholar). Astrocytomas are clinically troubling because they diffusely infiltrate the brain, impeding complete surgical resection of neoplastic cells, and because lower grade tumors often progress to higher grade variants. Because the latter respond poorly to radiotherapies and chemotherapies, malignant astrocytomas are currently untreatable. Glioblastoma multiforme rank among the most malignant brain lesions, with a median survival of less than 12 months. High grade gliomas can be classified into primary and secondary glioblastomas (3Kleihues P. Louis D.N. Scheithauer B.W. Rorke L.B. Reifenberger G. Burger P.C. Cavenee W.K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 215-225Google Scholar). Primary glioblastomas appear mainly de novo and are often associated with deregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 expression. Secondary glioblastomas, on the other hand, develop from the progression of lower grade tumors that often carry mutations in the p53 gene. In addition to EGFR and p53 mutations, a number of genetic alterations affecting interphasing biochemical pathways have been correlated with glioma pathogenesis. This involves gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in genes regulating p53-mediated apoptosis (p16ARF and Mdm2), cell cycle arrest (pRb, cdk4, and p16Ink4a), cell proliferation, and survival (Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Akt) (4Maher E.A. Furnari F.B. Bachoo R.M. Rowitch D.H. Louis D.N. Cavenee W.K. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1311-1333Google Scholar). c-Myc is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor that triggers cell proliferation and apoptosis, functions that seem to be effectuated mainly through activation of the cdk4/pRb/E2F pathway (5Sears R.C. Nevins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11617-11620Google Scholar). c-Myc functions as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein in association with its partner Max to facilitate expression of E-box-containing target genes (6Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Myc has recently been assigned roles in chromatin remodeling of target promoters, a process that involves recruitment via the N-terminal transactivation domain of co-activator complexes including histone acetylases, ATPase/helicase activities, as well as an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex (7Amati B. Frank S.R. Donjerkovic D. Taubert S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: 135-145Google Scholar, 8Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2023-2030Google Scholar). In line with its involvement in a wide range of neoplasms, there is circumstantial evidence that suggests c-Myc also plays a role in gliomagenesis, including deregulation of the c-Myc pathway in human glioblastoma multiforme (9Engelhard III, H.H. Butler IV, A.B. Bauer K.D. J. Neurosurg. 1989; 71: 224-232Google Scholar, 10Lang F.F. Miller D.C. Koslow M. Newcomb E.W. J. Neurosurg. 1994; 81: 427-436Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this expression is poorly understood, it may be mediated by various genetic changes associated with glioma progression including: increased platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling, which is commonly observed during early stages of glioma pathogenesis (2Louis D.N. Pomeroy S.L. Cairncross J.G. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 125-128Google Scholar) and which can trigger deregulated c-Myc expression through Src tyrosine kinase signaling (11Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 580-586Google Scholar, 12Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Google Scholar, 13Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L.

In addition, genetic lesions affecting the Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which are often present in glioblastoma multiforme tumors, can prolong the half-life of c-Myc and hence contribute to c-Myc accumulation in high grade gliomas (17Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Google Scholar). In this study, we test the hypothesis that overexpression of human c-Myc 2 in astroglia triggers gliomagenesis. The c-Myc locus consists of three exons that encode various alternatively translated c-Myc isoforms, designated c-Myc 1, c-Myc 2, and c-Myc S (18Ryan K.M. Birnie G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 713-721Google Scholar, 19Spotts G.D. Patel S.V. Xiao Q. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1459-1468Google Scholar). Translation of c-Myc 2 and S are initiated from AUG codons in exon II, whereas c-Myc 1 is initiated from a non-AUG (CUG) codon in exon I. Although both c-Myc 2 and S promote cell proliferation and apoptosis and have been associated with cellular transformation (19Spotts G.D. Patel S.V. Xiao Q. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1459-1468Google Scholar, 20Xiao Q. Claassen G. Shi J. Adachi S. Sedivy J. Hann S.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3803-3808Google Scholar), c-Myc 1 seems to play a separate role in growth arrest control (18Ryan K.M. Birnie G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 713-721Google Scholar). Here we prepared transgenic mice with a human c-Myc 2- and S-encoding minigene under transcriptional control of an astrocyte-specific promoter. We report that transgenic mice overexpressing c-Myc 2 and S proteins develop early onset genetically engineered murine (GEM) malignant gliomas that show features of human primary malignant gliomas. To direct transgenic expression of c-Myc 2 and c-Myc S in astroglia, the myelin basic protein promoter of the myelin basic protein/c-Myc plasmid (21Jensen N.A. Pedersen K.M. Celis J.E. West M.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2123-2129Google Scholar) was removed by digestion withHindIII and BamHI and replaced with a PCR product encompassing 2.2 kb of the human GFAP gene transcriptional regulatory sequences (22Brenner M. Kisseberth W.C. Su Y. Besnard F. Messing A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1030-1037Google Scholar). This places the genomic sequence containing exons II and III of the human c-Myc gene under control of the GFAP promoter. The transgene fragment was excised from the plasmid backbone byEcoRI digestion, gel-purified, and microinjected at a concentration of 6 ng/μl into fertilized mouse eggs as previously described (23Jensen N.A. Rodriguez M.L. Garvey J.S. Miller C.A. Hood L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3192-3196Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were identified by PCR analysis of DNA samples prepared from tail biopsies using the following PCR program: one cycle at 96 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles at 96 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, and 75 °C for 30 s; and one cycle at 75 °C for 8 min. The primer sets used were: 5′-TACAAGCATGAGCCACCCCAC-3′ (GFAP promoter primer, sense) and 5′-GGAGAATCGGACACATCCTCG-3′ (human c-Myc primer, antisense) or the human c-Myc specific primers 5′-CGATTCCTTCTAACAGAAATGTCCTGAG-3′ and 5′-AGATTTGGCTCAATGATATATTTGCCAG-3′. In some cases, the mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mg of BrdUrd/g of mouse weight (diluted in physiological saline) 3 h before the mice were sacrificed. The brains and optic nerves were removed from transgenic and control mice and immediately frozen in liquid N2. Tissue sections (20 μm) were cut with a cryostat microtome, collected on gelatinized glass slides, fixed with methanol for 5 min, and either stained with hematoxylin or subjected to immunohistochemistry. The fixed sections were preincubated 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin to reduce background, and immunohistochemistry was carried out as previously described using phosphate-buffered saline with 2% bovine serum albumin as the antibody diluent (24Jensen N.A. West M.J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29921-29926Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used at 1:100 dilution are mouse CNPase (Neomarkers), mouse NeuN (Chemicon), mouse GFAP (Chemicon), mouse VEGF (Santa Cruz), mouse PCNA (Sigma), rabbit GFAP (Sigma), rabbit c-Myc (Santa Cruz), rabbit cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit HOF antisera (25Mitchelmore C. Kjaerulff K.M. Pedersen H.C. Nielsen J.V. Rasmussen T.E. Fisker M.F. Finsen B. Pedersen K.M. Jensen N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7598-7609Google Scholar). For staining with sheep bromodeoxyuridine antisera (1:200 dilution; Research Diagnostics), the fixed sections were first treated for 30 s each with 2m HCl and 0.1 m borate. Primary antibodies were detected with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse (DAKO) and donkey anti-sheep (Research Diagnostics Inc.) at 1:100 dilution. TUNEL labeling was carried out using the in situcell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Frozen regions of mouse brains were homogenized on ice in 100 μl of RIPA buffer containing 450 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% v/v protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After 30 min on ice, the extracts were spun at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were recovered. The protein concentration was measured (Bio-Rad), and 20 μg of each extract was loaded on a 10–20% Tris-glycine gel (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications). Western blots were analyzed using the anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Western Breeze kit (Invitrogen). The primary antibodies were rabbit EGFR (Santa Cruz), rabbit Mdm2 (Santa Cruz), rabbit aquaporin-4 (Chemicon), and rabbit c-Myc (Santa Cruz) (diluted 1:500); mouse VEGF (Santa Cruz), rabbit E2F1 (Santa Cruz), and rabbit Connexin 43 (Chemicon) (diluted 1:2000); and mouse actin (Sigma), mouse PCNA (Sigma), and rabbit HOF antisera (25Mitchelmore C. Kjaerulff K.M. Pedersen H.C. Nielsen J.V. Rasmussen T.E. Fisker M.F. Finsen B. Pedersen K.M. Jensen N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7598-7609Google Scholar) (diluted 1:5000). Approximately half of a total of 14 transgenic mice, established by pronuclear microinjection of a c-Myc 2/S recombinant minigene, developed neurological disabilities (Fig.1, A and B, and Table I). The animals were killed at the time they presented with terminal disease, which in most cases occurred before 3 weeks of age (Table I). Affected animals harbored markedly enlarged cerebrums, enlargement of the lateral ventricles, as well as increased cellularity in the cerebral hemispheres (Fig. 1,C–H, K, O, and P). The increment in cellularity involved the neocortex, striatum, and subventricular zone of all of the affected animals (Table I). The high cellularity of the tumors as well as the presence of small and large centers of cell death with or without pseudo-palisading are reminiscent of glioblastoma multiforme (Fig. 1, H, J, andP). A subset of animals harbored a highly scattered and widespread tumor cell infiltration in the cerebral cortex without cell death centers (Fig. 1 K). This pattern resembles that of the extensively infiltrating human malignant glial cell neoplasm gliomatosis cerebri, which lacks the necrotic centers characteristic of glioblastoma multiforme. A large circumscribed tumor was disclosed in one mouse that occupied the dorso-ventral axis of the diencephalon, i.e. from the thalamus to the optic nerves (Fig. 1, I and M). This tumor exhibited a high degree of cellularity, necrotic centers, and microvessels but showed low to moderate spreading of tumor cells outside the diencephalon. A subset of animals harbored, in addition to cerebral glioma, a large intracranial hemorrhage that compressed and atrophied the surrounding structure (data not shown). Two founder mice, designated Tg-7 and Tg-8, gave rise to transgenic progeny that became disoriented and ataxic during the second and third postnatal weeks (Fig. 1 N and Table I). The mice harbored markedly enlarged cerebrums that showed profiles of diffuse infiltrating malignant glioma lesions with pseudo-palisading and central cell death centers (Fig. 1, Oand P). The cerebellums of the mice were rudimentary, lacking deep fissures and folia (Fig. 1 Q). In line with the specificity of the GFAP promoter, other organs appeared normal in affected GFAP/c-Myc transgenic mice.Table IMalignant gliomas in GFAP/c-Myc transgenic miceTransgenic founderSexaM, male; F, female.LifespanbP, postnatal day; w, weeks; F2 shows the affected animals from the heterozygous cross.Neurological symptomscD, disoriented; A, apathetic; Icp, increased intracranial pressure; Atx, ataxia.Malignant gliomadCc, cerebral cortex; Cb, cerebellum; Dc, diencephalon; On, optic nerve; Wm, white matter.F0F1F2Tg-1MP14D, A, IcpCc, WmTg-2FP16D, A, IcpCc, WmTg-3FP22D, A, IcpCc, DceThis tumor appeared circumscribed., On, WmTg-4FP12D, A, IcpCc, Dc, On, WmTg-5NDfNot determined.P5NDNDTg-6MP40D, A, IcpCcTg-7M2–3 wD, A, Icp, AtxCc, CbTg-8M2–3 wD, A, Icp, AtxCc, CbTg-9gThe progeny are currently under analysis.FTg-10gThe progeny are currently under analysis.FTg-11gThe progeny are currently under analysis.MTg-12gThe progeny are currently under analysis.FTg-13MTg-14hNo transgenic progeny was obtained from this mouse.Ma M, male; F, female.b P, postnatal day; w, weeks; F2 shows the affected animals from the heterozygous cross.c D, disoriented; A, apathetic; Icp, increased intracranial pressure; Atx, ataxia.d Cc, cerebral cortex; Cb, cerebellum; Dc, diencephalon; On, optic nerve; Wm, white matter.e This tumor appeared circumscribed.f Not determined.g The progeny are currently under analysis.h No transgenic progeny was obtained from this mouse. Open table in a new tab Transgenic animals harbored a spectrum of abnormal brain cells ranging from an increased cellular density around the lateral ventricles to diffuse infiltration of neoplastic cells in the cerebral cortex. To reveal the cellular origin of these cell populations, we investigated whether or not they expressed the astrocytic intermediate filament protein GFAP. As shown in Fig. 2(A–F), the abnormal cell populations in both the neocortex and periventricular zone express GFAP, indicating that they originate in cells of the astroglial lineage. In line with a glial cell origin, there was no expression of the neuronal differentiation marker NeuN in these cells (Fig. 2 G). There were numerous hypertrophic GFAP-positive astrocytes located in the vicinity of tumor foci, and processes from some of these cells appeared to be in direct physical contact with tumor cells (Fig. 2 H). Whether these cells represent normal reactive astroglia that develop in response to brain pathology or they constitute a subpopulation of diffusely proliferating neoplastic cells is not clear at the present. Moreover, GFAP-expressing cells also infiltrated the white matter of affected brains in association with a severe hypomyelination (Fig. 2,I–L). A characteristic feature of human malignant gliomas is that they are often composed of a mixture of proliferating, dying, and metabolically stressed cells that express angiogenic factors. To determine whether or not the GEM gliomas show some of these characteristics, we first investigated the pattern of BrdUrd labeling in brains of affected transgenic mice following administration of BrdUrd 3 h before killing. This short time frame ensures that only actively dividing cell populations are labeled. Using BrdUrd labeling and immunohistochemical localization, numerous BrdUrd-positive cells were revealed in both diffuse and circumscribed glioma lesions (Fig.3, A–D). On the contrary, only a few positive nuclei were disclosed in age-matched nontransgenic control animals, and they appeared mainly in regions of postnatal neurogenesis such as the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (data not shown). In line with a high tumor grade, there was also morphological evidence of regressive processes in the GEM gliomas, including circumscribed and small centers of cell death (Fig. 1). Thus, to reveal whether apoptosis plays a role in the continued loss of cells in the tumors, we used molecular markers of programmed cell death including TUNEL labeling and staining with an anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody. Numerous TUNEL-positive nuclei were scattered around large necrotic centers in the GEM gliomas (Fig. 3,E and F). As mentioned above, some GEM gliomas showed a widespread diffuse infiltration of the cerebral cortex in the absence of cell death centers. These gliomas, however, were TUNEL-positive and harbored cleaved caspase 3-expressing apoptotic cells scattered within tumor foci (Fig. 3, G–J). Expression of the vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) is up-regulated in human malignant glioma cells located at the periphery of necrotic centers (26Plate K.H. Breier G. Weich H.A. Risau W. Nature. 1992; 359: 845-848Google Scholar, 27Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Google Scholar). In line with this, VEGF expression was also up-regulated in GEM glioma cells surrounding cell death areas (Figs. 3,K and L, and4).Figure 4Molecular signatures of GEM gliomas.Western blot analysis of protein extracts from control cerebral cortex (Cont) and GEM gliomas 1–4. GEM glioma 3 is highly circumscribed. Equivalent protein amounts were loaded on separate protein gels, blotted, and probed with the indicated antibodies. In some cases, the probed blots were stripped and reprobed with a different antibody. The results demonstrate that all GEM gliomas exhibit elevated levels of c-Myc 2, c-Myc S, and the proliferation marker PCNA. In the circumscribed GEM glioma 3, a substantial increase in c-Myc S is observed together with a reduced expression of Cx 43 and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and a marked increase in VEGF, relative to the diffuse GEM gliomas 1, 2, and 4. Whereas EGFR is elevated in all the GEM gliomas, expression of Mdm2 is variable, and there is no observable change in E2F1 protein levels in GEM gliomas compared with the control extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next investigated the pattern of c-Myc expression in various GEM gliomas. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of the c-Myc transgene was revealed in tumor biopsies from c-Myc 2/S transgenic mice but not in brain biopsies from control brains. We consistently detected two c-Myc specific bands of ∼64 and 52 kDa in Western blots. The 64-kDa band is consistent with the molecular mass of c-Myc 2, and the 52-kDa band is consistent with that of c-Myc S. The c-Myc S isoform is 100 amino acids shorter than c-Myc 2, corresponding to a difference of about 11 kDa. Notably, the c-Myc S isoform seems to predominate in a well circumscribed glioma, whereas a more equal distribution of the two c-Myc isoforms is seen in diffuse infiltrating tumors (Fig. 4). PCNA is a component of DNA polymerase ∂ and is widely used as a nuclear marker of continuously dividing tumor cell populations (28Waseem N.H. Lane D.P. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 121-129Google Scholar). As expected for actively dividing malignant cells, there was a strong correlation between the pattern of PCNA expression and that of c-Myc in the tumors (Fig. 4). Because expression of a number of signaling molecules is enforced in human malignant gliomas, we next determined whether this was also the case in the early onset GEM gliomas. Overexpression and/or amplification of EGFR occur in many (∼40% of cases) human primary glioblastomas but less often in lower grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas (3Kleihues P. Louis D.N. Scheithauer B.W. Rorke L.B. Reifenberger G. Burger P.C. Cavenee W.K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 215-225Google Scholar). Hence, EGFR overexpression is characteristic of de novo malignant lesions and presumably responsible for activation of the Ras pathway in these tumors, because activating p21 Ras mutations are uncommon in gliomas (29Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, we found EGFR overexpression in tumor biopsies from various GEM gliomas. Moreover, the p53-negative regulator Mdm2 is also overexpressed in many human primary glioblastomas (3Kleihues P. Louis D.N. Scheithauer B.W. Rorke L.B. Reifenberger G. Burger P.C. Cavenee W.K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 215-225Google Scholar). Mdm2 has been noted to bind to p53 to both inhibit transcription and to target p53 for degradation resulting in an increased resistance of tumor cells to programmed cell death (30Juven-Gershon T. Oren M. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 71-83Google Scholar). In line with a primary malignancy, a subset of GEM gliomas showed a marked increase in Mdm2 expression (Fig. 4). Thus, the c-Myc-expressing GEM gliomas seem to harbor a molecular signature resembling that of human primary glioblastomas. Cerebral edema occurs in association with most malignant brain tumors including gliomas (31Papadopoulos M.C. Saadoun S. Davies D.C. Bell B.A. Br. J. Neurosurg. 2001; 15: 101-108Google Scholar). Affected GFAP/c-Myc transgenic mice showed features of brain edema, including swelling of the brain, demyelination of white matter tracts, as well as reactive glioses (Figs. 1, D andO, and 2, H–J). Hence, we investigated the pattern of expression of the astroglial water channel protein aquaporin-4 in GEM gliomas because this protein has been claimed to be up-regulated in human edematous malignant gliomas (32Saadoun S. Papadopoulos M.C. Davies D.C. Krishna S. Bell B.A. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2002; 72: 262-265Google Scholar). We found a moderate increase in aquaporin-4 expression in diffuse infiltrating GEM tumors (Fig. 4). In contrast, there was no discernable change in expression of the cell proliferation-associated transcription factor E2F1 in the tumors (Fig. 4). We next investigated the pattern of connexin 43 (Cx 43) expression in different GEM gliomas, because this astroglial gap junction protein has been noted to play important roles in glioma cell invasion as well as in the establishment of astroglial tumor syncytia (33Zhang W. Couldwell W.T. Simard M.F. Song H. Lin J.H. Nedergaard M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1994-2003Google Scholar, 34Lin J.H. Takano T. Cotrina M.L. Arcuino G. Kang J. Liu S. Gao Q. Jiang L. Li F. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Haubrich S. Willecke K. Goldman S.A. Nedergaard M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4302-4311Google Scholar). Moreover, a variable expression of Cx 43 has been disclosed in human glioblastoma multiforme tumors (33Zhang W. Couldwell W.T. Simard M.F. Song H. Lin J.H. Nedergaard M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1994-2003Google Scholar, 35Shinoura N. Chen L. Wani M.A. Kim Y.G. Larson J.J. Warnick R.E. Simon M. Menon A.G. Bi W.L. Stambrook P.J. J.

Glia. 2001; 33: 107-117Google Scholar). In line with a role of the protein in astroglioma cell spreading and invasion, there was a marked lack of Cx 43 expression in a well circumscribed GEM glioma as opposed to diffuse infiltrating lesions (Fig. 4). The fact that the latter tumors express the astroglial gap junction protein Cx 43 (Fig.4) indicates that they have the capacity to establish syncytial tumor networks between GEM glioma cells and astroglia (33Zhang W. Couldwell W.T. Simard M.F. Song H. Lin J.H. Nedergaard M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1994-2003Google Scholar, 34Lin J.H. Takano T. Cotrina M.L. Arcuino G. Kang J. Liu S. Gao Q. Jiang L. Li F. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Haubrich S. Willecke K. Goldman S.A. Nedergaard M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4302-4311Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of tumor syncytia, only a subpopulation of cells within individual GEM tumor foci seems to express the c-Myc transgene (Fig. 5, A–D). Moreover, these c-Myc-expressing cells appear to constitute an actively dividing subpopulation because they co-express the PCNA antigen (Fig. 5,E–H). Thus, diffuse infiltrating GEM tumors seem to comprise both actively dividing true neoplastic cells as well as a less proliferating bystander cell population. We next investigated the possibility that the less dividing cell population of the GEM tumors express the novel astroglial marker HOF. The HOF gene encodes a nuclear broad complex tramtrack bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger domain factor expressed in both developing and mature astrocytes as well as in reactive astroglia during brain pathology (25Mitchelmore C. Kjaerulff K.M. Pedersen H.C. Nielsen J.V. Rasmussen T.E. Fisker M.F. Finsen B. Pedersen K.M. Jensen N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7598-7609Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 (A–C), levels of HOF expression are up-regulated in some but not all GEM gliomas. Using BrdUrd labeling and immunohistochemical localization, we were unable to detect either BrdUrd and HOF (Fig. 6, D–G) or PCNA and HOF (Fig. 6, H and I) double-labeled cells in diffuse GEM lesions. Thus, HOF is unlikely to be expressed in actively dividing GEM tumor cells. Moreover, HOF is expressed in cells with both large and small sized nuclei (Fig.6 I). Co-immunolocalization experiments show that HOF expression in GEM gliomas is often confined to cells that show robust expression of the astroglial differentiation marker GFAP (Fig. 6,J and K). Taken together, these data suggest that diffuse infiltrating GEM tu"

The functioning of both systems is required for optimal clearance of pathogens from the airways. In cystic fibrosis (CF), dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is associated with recurrent pulmonary infections despite an intense inflammatory and immune response. We reported recently that TNF-α decreased gap junction connectivity in non-CF airway cells, a mechanism that was absent in CF cells expressing the ΔPhe-508 mutant of CFTR. We have now identified the tyrosine kinase c-Src as a possible pathway between the mediators of inflammation and the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43). Indeed, TNF-α increased the proportion of activated c-Src in non-CF airway cells. Moreover, pharmacological antagonists and expression in non-CF cells of a dominant negative construct of c-Src prevented Cx43 channel closure by TNF-α. Finally, gap junction channel closure was prevented by expression of a Cx43 mutant lacking tyrosine phosphorylation sites for c-Src. Additional experiments showed that activation of c-Src was defective in CF airway cells but rescued in CFTR-corrected CF cells. These data suggest that CFTR dysfunction is associated with altered TNF-α signaling, resulting in the persistence of gap junction connectivity in CF airway cells. We propose that altered regulation of c-Src may contribute to the dysregulated inflammatory response that is characteristic of the CF phenotype.

Other in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that early inflammation in CF airways is associated with abnormal production of pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines (8Kahn T.Z. Wagener J.S. Bost T.

Pier G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 14: 6907-6912Google Scholar). Dysregulation of the inflammatory response may represent an intrinsic component of the CF phenotype because it is observed independently of the type of infectious stimulus (14Muhlebach M.S. Stewart P.W. Leigh M.W. Noah T.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 186-191Google Scholar, 15Muhlebach M.S. Noah T.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 911-915Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, an increasing number of reports have shown that CF airway epithelial cells exhibit increased translocation of the nuclear factor-κB, a transcriptional activator of immunomodulatory genes (11Tabary O. Escotte S. Couetil J.P. Hubert D. Dusser D. Puchelle E. Jacquot J. Immunology. 2000; 164: 3377-3384Google Scholar, 16DiMango E. Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Tabibi S. Prince A. J. Clin.

Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Google Scholar). Thus, mutations in CFTR may cause alterations in intracellular signal transduction pathways, resulting in an exaggerated recruitment of neutrophils through constitutive and bacteria-induced release of inflammatory mediators that is disproportionate to the infectious stimulus (11Tabary O. Escotte S. Couetil J.P. Hubert D. Dusser D. Puchelle E. Jacquot J. Immunology. 2000; 164: 3377-3384Google Scholar, 20Van Heeckeren A. Walenga R. Konstan M.W. Bonfield T. Davis P.B. Ferkol T. J. Clin.

It is currently not known, however, how mutations of CFTR lead to an abnormal inflammatory response. It is now well established that the CFTR protein, in addition to functioning as a Cl− channel, plays an important role in regulating other ion channels and transporters of the plasma membrane. Thus, CFTR influences the function and properties of Cl−, Na+, and K+ channels in epithelial cells as well as the control of electroneutral Na+ reabsorption, Cl−/HCO3− exchange and water permeability (22Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S145-S166Google Scholar, 23Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. Nitschke R. Mall M.

We recently provided evidence for a role of CFTR in the control of gap junction channel connectivity (25Chanson M. Scerri I. Suter S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1677-1684Google Scholar, 26Chanson M. Berclaz P.-Y. Scerri I. Dudez T. Wernke-Dollries K. Pizurki L. Pavirani A. Fiedler M.A. Suter S. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1775-1784Google Scholar). Defects in CFTR-dependent regulation of other transport mechanisms may contribute to some of the phenotypes that are observed in the CF pathology (27Guggino W.B. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 888-889Google Scholar). So far, the molecular mechanisms linking CFTR to other channels and transporters are unknown. Gap junctions, the only channels that allow direct exchange of ions and small (<1 kDa) metabolites between cells, are composed of proteins called connexins (Cx) in vertebrates. Gap junctions contribute to tissue homeostasis and have been involved in the regulation of diverse biological functions (28Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Google Scholar, 29Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Google Scholar, 30Meda P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 369-377Google Scholar, 31Spray D.C. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1996; 23: 1038-1040Google Scholar). Critical roles for gap junctions have been elucidated by the discovery of disease-causing mutations in human connexin genes and the observation that mice with targeted deletions of connexins develop distinct phenotypes (32Simon A.M. Goodenough D.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 477-483Google Scholar, 33White T.W. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 283-310Google Scholar, 34Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Güldenagel M. Deutsch U. Söhl G. Biol. Chem. 2003; 383: 725-737Google Scholar). These recent findings confirm the view that perturbation of gap junction connectivity contributes to disease initiation and/or progression. We recently reported that the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α differentially regulates gap junctional communication in airway epithelial cell lines. In non-CF airway cells, gap junction channels rapidly close in response to TNF-α. In contrast, this mechanism is defective in CF airway cells but can be rescued by expression of wild-type CFTR (26Chanson M. Berclaz P.-Y. Scerri I. Dudez T. Wernke-Dollries K. Pizurki L. Pavirani A. Fiedler M.A. Suter S. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1775-1784Google Scholar). These observations, together with other reports (18Weber A.J. Soong G. Bryan R. Shahryar S. Prince A. Am. J.

Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14360-14366Google Scholar), suggest that CFTR may interfere with some of the signal transduction pathways initiated through receptor-ligand interactions. In this context, differential regulation of channel activity may represent a model to search for the signaling pathways that are defective in CF cells. Elucidating the mechanisms linking genotype to disease may be of critical importance to understand the pathogenesis of exaggerated airway inflammation in the CF lung. Here we have attempted to identify the signal transduction pathways involved in the down-regulation of gap junction connectivity by TNF-α in non-CF airway cells. We provide evidence that TNF-α signaling initiates the activation of the tyrosine kinase c-Src in airway epithelial cells. We further show that inhibition of c-Src tyrosine kinase activity abolished TNF-α-induced closure of gap junction channels in non-CF airway cells. Moreover, we show that activation of c-Src is defective in CF airway cells but rescued in CFTR-corrected CF cells. These results indicate that c-Src signaling pathway links the mediators of inflammation to gap junction channels. They also suggest that mutations in the CFTR protein alter the c-Src tyrosine kinase transduction pathway. The defective activity of c-Src in CF cells may contribute to some dysfunction of the CF airway epithelium, including ion channel activity, cytokine production, mucus secretion, and epithelial cell differentiation.

Beas2B cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CF15 cells were cultured on surfaces coated with 50 μg/ml of human placental collagen IV (Sigma) and maintained in 3:1 (v/v) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with growth factors (26Chanson M. Berclaz P.-Y. Scerri I. Dudez T. Wernke-Dollries K. Pizurki L. Pavirani A. Fiedler M.A. Suter S. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1775-1784Google Scholar). IB3-1 and C38 cells were cultured on surfaces coated with collagen IV and 10 μg/ml bovine plasma fibronectin (Invitrogen) and maintained in bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (SeraTech, Griesbach, Switzerland), 30 units/ml penicillin, and 30 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Beas2B cells are hereafter referred to as non-CF cells, CF15, and IB3-1 cells as CF cells, and C38 cells as corrected cells. For Western blots, subconfluent monolayers of cells were rinsed with PBS and scraped into an ice-cold solubilization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After a 30-min incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 50,000 × g. Supernatants were recovered, and total amounts of protein were determined by a bicinchoninic acid quantification assay (Sigma). Fifteen to 25 μg of protein were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore AG, Volketswill, Switzerland). Membranes were then soaked overnight at 4 °C in a 2% defatted milk saturation buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 133 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.2% sodium azide. Blotted proteins were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either a mouse monoclonal Cx43 (1:500 dilution) antibody (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA), a monoclonal v-Src (1:250 dilution) antibody (Oncogene Research Products, La Jolla, CA), or a polyclonal c-Src(Tyr(P)-418) (1:200 dilution) phosphospecific antibody (BioSource International, Palo Alto, CA). This step was followed by a 1-h incubation with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to peroxidase (The Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Immunoreactivity was detected through the Super Signal West Pico kit (Pierce). For immunofluorescence labeling, non-CF and CF airway cell lines were cultured on glass coverslips and fixed for 2–3 min with methanol at −20 °C. The coverslips were rinsed and incubated successively with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h, 0.5 m NH4Cl for 15 min, and PBS supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin for another 30 min. Cells were the rinsed and incubated overnight with a poylclonal antibody (1:30 dilution) raised against Cx43 (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX). After washing in PBS, the coverslips were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate for 3 h, counter-stained with Evans Blue, and then examined using fluorescent microscopy. Images were acquired with a high sensitivity black and white CCD Visicam (Visitron systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany) camera connected to a personal computer. Images were captured using the software Metafluor 4.01 (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA) and processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5. pMT2-plasmids encoding either for a kinase-dead version of c-Src (SrcK−), which acts as a dominant negative (K295 M mutation), or a constitutively active c-Src (SrcK+), in which the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between phosphotyrosine 527 and the SH2 domain is disrupted (Y527A mutation), were used (42Abram C.L. Coutneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Google Scholar, 43Giepmans B.N.G. Hengeveld T. Postma F.R. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8544-8549Google Scholar). A chimeric version of SrcK−was also constructed using PCR by destroying the stop codon and appending the cDNA for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Full-length cDNAs of wild-type human Cx43 (WT-Cx43) and of Cx43 where tyrosines 247 and 265 were replaced by alanines (Y247A,Y265A-Cx43) were constructed using conventional two-step PCR mutagenesis and sub-cloned into pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Point mutations were verified by sequencing. About 50% confluent cells were transfected either with the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen AG, Basel, Switzerland) or the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics), according to manufacturers' instructions. The efficiency of cell transfection when using pMT2 plasmids encoding for SrcK− or SrcK+ was evaluated by co-transfecting the cells with pMT2 encoding for EGFP. Thirty-48 h later, small colonies of EGFP-positive cells among EGFP-negative cells were observed and subjected to dye coupling. Dye coupling studies were performed on subconfluent monolayers of cells incubated in a solution (external solution) containing (in mm): 136 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 2.5 glucose and was buffered to pH 7.4 with 10 mm HEPES-NaOH. Single cells were impaled with microelectrodes backfilled with a 4% Lucifer Yellow solution prepared in 150 mm LiCl (buffered to pH 7.2 with 10 mm HEPES). The fluorescent tracer was allowed to fill the cells by simple diffusion for 3 min. After the injection period, the electrode was removed, and the number of fluorescent cells was counted. Cells were visualized using epifluorescent illumination provided by a 100-watt mercury lamp and the appropriate set of filters. For dye coupling experiments performed in cell clusters expressing EGFP, a filter specific for fluorescein (excitation range 465–490 nm) was used, and images of the fluorescent clusters were acquired before the injection of Lucifer Yellow. The green fluorescent cells were then injected with Lucifer Yellow as described above. The yellow fluorescence of the dye could be distinguished from the green fluorescence of EGFP using a filter with a broader excitation spectrum (420–490 nm). Because of the brighter intensity of the Lucifer Yellow signal, the image acquisition time was typically 10 times smaller than that used for EGFP, so that the green fluorescence of the cells was not detected by the camera. In Photoshop, the image with the EGFP signal was ascribed a red color and the image with the Lucifer Yellow signal a green color, allowing us to determine the extent of dye diffusion in EGFP-positive cells. Phase-contrast views of each injected cell clusters were also taken. Experiments on cells expressing SrcK− or the chimeric versions of SrcK− fused with EGFP yielding similar results, and the data were pooled for quantitative analysis. For electrical coupling studies, the dual whole-cell patch clamp approach was applied on pairs of cells incubated in the external solution. Both cells of a pair were voltage-clamped at a common holding potential of 0 mV using the EPC-9 amplifier and a PC-501A amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). To measure gap junctional currents (Ij), transjunctional potential differences (V j) were elicited by changing the holding potential of one member of a cell pair. Ij was defined as the current recorded in the cell kept at a 0 mV. Junctional conductance (g j) was then calculated byg j = Ij/V j. Series resistance was not compensated and was less than 2% of the combined junctional and cell input resistance. To resolve the activity of single gap junction channels, g j was pharmacologically reduced with the gap junction blocker halothane. Digitized current traces were filtered at 0.1–1.0 kHz for analysis and display of single-channel activity using customized software (MacDAQ; kindly provided by A.C.G. van Ginneken, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). To determine unitary gap junctional conductances (γj), the amplitudes of single-channel transitions were measured and divided by the applied V j. Conductance values were then converted into step-amplitude histograms with a bin width of 4 pS. For these experiments, which were carried out under strong buffering conditions for H+ and Ca2+, patch electrodes were filled with a solution containing (in mm): 135 CsCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 5.5 EGTA, 3 MgATP, and 0.1 GTP, buffered to pH 7.2 with 10 mm HEPES-CsOH. CsCl was chosen to replace KCl in these experiments in order to improve resolution of single gap junction channels by reducing activity of non-junctional channels. Cells under experimental conditions were incubated for 30 min in external solution supplemented with 100 units/ml TNF-α, 100–500 ng/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosalipopolysaccharide (LPS), or 10 nm IL-8. Ten percent fetal calf serum was added to the external solution for experiments with LPS. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was used at a concentration of 1 μm and was applied for 5 min. For studies with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cells were pre-treated for 30–120 min with 20 μmPD98059, 50 μm PP1, or 200 μm tyrphostin 47. All agents were from Sigma (Sigma) except TNF-α (Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Germany). All data are shown as mean ± S.E. and compared using unpaired t tests. We have reported previously that 100 units/ml TNF-α, a concentration that maximally stimulates the release of IL-8, decreased gap junction connectivity in non-CF but not CF airway cells within 15 min by a yet undefined mechanism (26Chanson M. Berclaz P.-Y. Scerri I. Dudez T. Wernke-Dollries K. Pizurki L. Pavirani A. Fiedler M.A. Suter S. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1775-1784Google Scholar). Plausible candidates for transduction of cell uncoupling could include direct closure of the channels by cytoplasmic factors like pH or Ca2+ or decreased expression of Cx43, the gap junction protein that is expressed in these airway cell lines (26Chanson M. Berclaz P.-Y. Scerri I. Dudez T. Wernke-Dollries K. Pizurki L. Pavirani A. Fiedler M.A. Suter S. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1775-1784Google Scholar). To address these possibilities, immunolabeling and Western blot analysis were performed to evaluate the expression of Cx43, and the dual patch clamp approach was used to monitor Cx43 channel activity. As shown in Fig.1 a (left panel), Cx43 was detected in intracellular compartments as well as in cell-cell contact areas as revealed by indirect immunofluorescence. No change in the distribution of Cx43 was observed in cells exposed to TNF-α (right panel). Similar observations were made for Cx43 in non-CF and rescued CF airway cells exposed either to TNF-α or the proinflammatory endotoxin LPS for 30 min (not shown). The total amount of Cx43 protein detected by Western blot did not change after exposure of non-CF cells for 30 min with TNF-α or LPS. In addition, no changes in the relative isoforms of Cx43 were detected for both mediators (Fig.1 b). Longer exposure (1, 3, 6, and 12 h) of the cells to TNF-α yielded similar results (not shown). Gap junction channel activity was studied under conditions of strong pH and Ca2+ buffering. Under these conditions, exposure of non-CF cells to TNF-α for 30 min decreased (p < 0.001) junctional conductance (g j) from 11.2 ± 3 (mean ± S.E., n = 6) to 2.8 ± 0.7 nS (n = 8). To investigate the effects of TNF-α on single gap junction channel activity, large driving forces were applied to cell pairs in which g j was reduced with halothane. The single channel conductance (γj) was measured before and after 30 min of treatment with TNF-α, and frequency histograms were constructed. As shown in Fig.2, TNF-α did not change the distribution of γj values measured. These results suggest that one mechanism by which TNF-α modulates gap junction connectivity in non-CF cells is by decreasing the open probability of Cx43 channels, likely via kinase activation of a signal transduction cascade. To identify other potent pro-inflammatory mediators on gap junction connectivity, we have studied the effects of LPS, LPA, and IL-8 on dye coupling of non-CF and CF cells. As shown in TableI, LPS and LPA markedly decreased dye coupling within minutes in non-CF cells, whereas IL-8 had no effect. LPS and LPA did not change the strength of gap junctional communication in CF cells (Table I).Table IEffects of proinflammatory mediators and phospholipids on dye coupling of non-CF and CF airway epithelial cellsAirway cellsBasalTNF-αLPSLPAIL-8Non-CF5.3 ± 0.6 (15)2.2 ± 0.4 (18)2.1 ± 0.3 (20)1.7 ± 0.2 (16)5.1 ± 0.9 (12)CF6.0 ± 0.6 (18)6.3 ± 0.4 (18)6.1 ± 0.8 (13)7.2 ± 1.0 (13)ND Open table in a new tab LPA has emerged as a ligand for G-coupled membrane receptors on various cell types. MAPK and the tyrosine kinase c-Src have been proposed to mediate the closure of Cx43 channels by LPA (44Hossain M.Z. Boynton A.L. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans; 2000/1–5)Google Scholar, 45Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 205-215Google Scholar). To investigate whether these signaling pathways are involved in TNF-α-induced dye uncoupling of non-CF cells, pharmacological inhibitors of MAPK (PD98059) and of tyrosine kinases (PP1 and tyrphostin 47) were used. As shown in Fig. 3, pretreatment of non-CF cells for 30–120 min with MAPK or tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not affect their normal extent of intercellular communication. However, the uncoupling effect of TNF-α was abrogated in the presence of PP1 or tyrphostin 47 but not PD98059 (Fig. 3). Similarly, the extent of dye coupling reached by LPS in the presence of PP1 (5.1 ± 0.8 cells, n = 7) was not different from that observed under control conditions (Table I). Pervanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, is known to inhibit gap junctional communication by increased tyrosine phosphorylation activity (44Hossain M.Z. Boynton A.L. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans; 2000/1–5)Google Scholar, 45Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 205-215Google Scholar, 46Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment with pervanadate for 30 min markedly decreased dye coupling in both non-CF (2.7 ± 0.5 cells, n = 7) and CF cells (1.5 ± 0.3 cells, n = 6). To examine whether c-Src is involved in the regulation of gap junction channel connectivity by TNF-α, non-CF cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding a dominant negative (SrcK−) version of the tyrosine kinase. Under these conditions, the uncoupling effect of TNF-α and LPS was fully prevented (Fig. 4). Conversely, the expression of an active mutant of c-Src (SrcK+) abolished gap junctional communication in CF cells. Under these conditions, the extent of dye coupling was reduced to 2.5 ±0.3 cells (n = 14). These results suggest that tyrosine kinase activity is stimulated by proinflammatory mediators and mediates gap junction closure in non-CF airway cells. To address further the possible regulation of Cx43 channel activity by activated c-Src, non-CF airway cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding for a mutant of Cx43 in which the tyrosines at positions 247 and 265 have been replaced with alanines (pIRES2-Y247A,Y265A-Cx43-EGFP), as these have been shown previously (43Giepmans B.N.G.

Expression of Y247A,Y265A-Cx43, as visualized by the red color ascribed to EGFP fluorescent cells in Fig.5 a, prevented the uncoupling effect of TNF-α in EGFP-positive cells (6.9 ± 0.7 cells,n = 20) but not in neighboring non-transfected cells (2 ± 0.3 cells, n = 17)."

Here, we show that MEK1 is phosphorylated in vivo at Ser212, a residue conserved among all MAPKK family members. Mutation of Ser212 to alanine enhanced the basal activity of MEK1, whereas the phosphomimetic aspartate mutation completely suppressed the activation of both wild-type MEK1 and the constitutively activated MEK1(S218D/S222D) mutant. Phosphorylation of Ser212 did not interfere with activating phosphorylation of MEK1 at Ser218/Ser222 or with binding to ERK2 substrate. Importantly, mimicking phosphorylation of the equivalent Ser212 residue of the yeast MAPKKs Pbs2p and Ste7p similarly abrogated their biological function.

Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Google Scholar). These modules are organized into an architecture of three sequentially acting protein kinases comprising a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK or MEK kinase), a MAPK kinase (MAPKK or MEK), and the MAPK itself. The propagation of the signal through MAPK pathways is facilitated by specific protein-protein interactions between individual components of the pathway and scaffolding proteins (3Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Google Scholar, 4Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Google Scholar). The prototypical and most studied MAPK pathway is the ERK1/2 pathway, which controls cell proliferation, differentiation, and development (1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells with growth and differentiation factors leads to the activation of the MAPKKK Raf by a complicated mechanism involving cellular relocalization and multiple phosphorylation events (5Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Google Scholar, 6Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Google Scholar). Activated Raf isoforms bind to and activate the MAPKKs MEK1 and MEK2 by phosphorylation of two serine residues (corresponding to Ser218 and Ser222 in MEK1) in their activation loop (7Alessi D.R.

The dual-specificity kinases MEK1 and MEK2 then catalyze the phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 at threonine and tyrosine residues within the activation loop motif Thr-Glu-Tyr (13Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Google Scholar), causing a reorientation of the loop and activation of the enzyme (14Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Google Scholar). Both MEK1 and MEK2 stably associate with ERK1/2, and this association is required for efficient activation of the latter in cells (15Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Google Scholar, 16Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Google Scholar). The binding site for ERK1/2 is located at the N terminus of MEK1/2 and consists of a short basic region known as the D domain (16Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Google Scholar). MEK1 and MEK2 also contain a unique proline-rich insert between subdomains IX and X, which is required for full activation of ERK1/2 in intact cells (17Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Google Scholar, 18Dang A. Frost J.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19909-19913Google Scholar). The magnitude and duration of MAPK activation are important determinants of the cellular response to extracellular signals (19Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar,20Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 818-826Google Scholar). Therefore, a tightly regulated balance between activation and inactivation mechanisms must exist to control the cellular activity of ERK1/2. Inactivation of the ERK1/2 enzymes is mainly achieved by dephosphorylation of the activating threonine and tyrosine residues. Biochemical and genetic studies have implicated both tyrosine-specific phosphatases and dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases in the negative regulation of ERK1/2 and other MAPKs (21Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Google Scholar, 22Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Google Scholar). Much less is known about the mechanisms that negatively regulate the pathway at the MAPKK level. The serine/threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A was identified as the major phosphatase inactivating MEK1 in lysates of PC12 cells (23Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of SV40 small t antigen, which binds to the A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and inactivates the enzyme, was found to stimulate MEK and ERK activity in CV-1 cells (24Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Google Scholar). It is not known whether protein phosphatase 2A activity for MEK1/2 is regulated. Feedback inhibition of MEK1/2 activity may also occur by direct phosphorylation. Several protein kinases, including Cdc2 (25Rossomando A.J. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Marshak D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1594-1602Google Scholar), ERK1/2 (9Gotoh Y. Matsuda S. Takenaka K. Hattori S. Iwamatsu A. Ishikawa M. Kosako H. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1891-1898Google Scholar, 26Brunet A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Google Scholar), have been shown to phosphorylate MEK1 at sites that are phosphorylated in intact cells. However, the impact of these phosphorylation events on the regulation of the ERK1/2 pathway remains uncertain. Here, we show that MEK1 is phosphorylated at Ser212 in intact cells. Substitution of Ser212with Ala enhanced the basal activity of MEK1 and MEK2, whereas phosphomimetic mutants completely inactivated the enzymes in vivo. We further show that mutations of the analogous Ser212 residue in the yeast MAPKKs Pbs2p and Ste7p similarly regulate their biological activity. Rat1 fibroblasts were cultured and synchronized by serum starvation as previously described (31Meloche S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 577-588Google Scholar). Rat1 cells were transfected with MEK1 expression plasmids using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). After 48 h, populations of stably transfected cells were selected by their ability to grow in complete minimum Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were growth-arrested by serum starvation for 24 h. The cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The sources of the plasmids used in this study were as follows: pGEX-2T/MEK2 (K.-L. Guan, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), pMT3-HA-SEK1 (J. Woodgett, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada), and pEF-Myc-MKK6 (A. Nebreda, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany). The plasmid pFA-Elk-1, which encodes a Gal4-Elk-1 fusion protein, and the Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid pFR-Luc were obtained from Stratagene. The XbaI/HindIII fragment of pGEX-MEK1, containing the entire human MEK1 coding sequence (32Meloche S. Gopalbhai K. Beatty B.G. Scherer S.W. Pellerin J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 88: 249-252Google Scholar), and theEcoRI/PvuII fragment of pGEX-MEK2 (33Zheng C.F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Google Scholar), containing the human MEK2 coding sequence, were subcloned into pALTER-1 (Promega). To generate HA-tagged constructs of MEK1 and MEK2, a synthetic oligonucleotide encoding the amino acid sequence YDVPDYASL was inserted at the N terminus of the respective cDNAs (after the initiator methionine) using the Altered Sites in vitromutagenesis system (Promega). HA-MEK1 and HA-MEK2 cDNA constructs were then used as templates for in vitro mutagenesis to generate the various mutants described in this study. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The HA-MEK1 and HA-MEK2 constructs were subcloned into the expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (34Servant M.J. Coulombe P. Turgeon B. Meloche S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 543-556Google Scholar). Commercial antibodies were obtained from the following suppliers: anti-phospho-Ser218/Ser222MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-MEK1 (Transduction Laboratories). Monoclonal antibody 12CA5 raised against influenza was a gift from M. Dennis (SignalGene). Immunoblot analysis of MEK1/2 activating loop phosphorylation was carried out according to the manufacturer's specifications. The phosphotransferase activities of endogenous or ectopically expressed MEK1 and MEK2 were assayed by measuring their ability to increase the myelin basic protein kinase activity of recombinant ERK2 in vitro as previously described (35Gopalbhai K. Meloche S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 35-47Google Scholar). For reporter gene assays, 293 cells seeded in 24-well plates were cotransfected with 1 μg of pFR-Luc reporter construct, 50 ng of pFA-Elk-1, 300 ng of pCMV-β-gal, and 1 μg of MEK1 expression plasmids. The total DNA amount was kept constant at 3 μg with the pRc/CMV vector. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and the activity of luciferase was assayed using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized by measuring β-galactosidase activity. For analysis of phosphorylated peptides, 10 Petri dishes (100 mm) of HEK 293 cells were transfected with HA-MEK1, and two of the dishes were metabolically labeled for 6 h with 2 mCi/ml [32P]phosphoric acid. Cell lysates were prepared, and HA-MEK1 was immunoprecipitated as described above. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and exposed to x-ray film. The protein band corresponding to32P-labeled HA-MEK1 was excised from the gel, subjected to dithiothreitol reduction and iodoacetamide alkylation, and then digested overnight at 37 °C with 0.2 μg of sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) (36Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Google Scholar). The tryptic peptides were extracted with 1% trifluoroacetic acid and 60% acetonitrile at 60 °C and separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac microbore C18 column using an Applied Biosystems 130A separation system. The column was developed at a flow rate of 150 μl/min using the following gradient program: 3 min in solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water), 0–50% solvent B (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile) during the next 60 min, and 50–100% solvent B during the remaining 7 min. The peptides were detected by absorbance at 220 nm, and the peaks were collected manually and subjected to Cerenkov counting to identify the radioactive phosphopeptides. Where necessary, HPLC-purified tryptic peptides were subjected to a second digestion with sequencing-grade endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The HPLC fractions were incubated for a total time of 5 h at 37 °C with two additions of 0.1 μg of Asp-N protease. The labeled peptides were applied to a Prosorb disc (Applied Biosystems) and subjected to automatic Edman degradation on a Procise Model 494 cLC sequencer using the general protocol of Hewick et al. (37Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Google Scholar). The phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were analyzed on-line using an Applied Biosystems Model 140D capillary separation system and ultraviolet detection. The yeast strains used in this study were W303-1AΔste7(MAT a ade2 leu2 trp1 his3 ura3Δste7::LEU2) (B. Errede, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), TM260 (MAT a ura3 leu2 trp1Δpbs2::LEU2) (H. Saito, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), YCW340 (MAT a ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 ssk2::LEU2 ssk22::LEU2 ste11::KanR), YCW365 (MAT a ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 ssk2::LEU2 ssk22::LEU2 ste50::TRP1) (38Wu C. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2425-2440Google Scholar), and YGJ208 (MAT a ssk2::LEU2 ssk22::LEU2 sho1::TRP1) (this study). Yeast cells were transformed by the method described (39Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Google Scholar), and the plasmid-containing cells were identified on selective plates. Mating of Δste7 strains carrying the differentSTE7 mutant alleles with the wild-type tester strain DC17 (MATα his1) (laboratory collection) was performed for 7 h before replicating the cells onto plates selecting for diploids. Cells with different PBS2 mutant alleles were analyzed for osmosensitivity by transferring to rich medium containing 0.9 m NaCl and scoring growth after 3 days. The construction of both PBS2 andSTE7 plasmids and their mutant alleles was performed using the in vivo recombination procedure in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae according to Jansen et al. 2G. Jansen, C. Wu, B. Schade, D. Y. Thomas, and M. Whitney, submitted for publication. Two backbone plasmids (low copy number) with the promoter region and the N-terminal part of either PBS2 or STE7 were first constructed: 1) pGREG506-PBS2-N, containing 701 bp of thePBS2 promoter region and the first 507 amino acids ofPBS2 coding sequence followed by an added uniqueNotI site and 2) pGREG506-STE7-N, containing 550 bp of theSTE7 promoter region and the first 352 amino acids ofSTE7 coding sequence followed by a NotI site. To generate the mutant plasmid constructs by the in vivorecombination procedure, the backbone plasmids were first digested withNotI and XhoI and co-transformed into the appropriate yeast strain with the respective C-terminal parts of the genes carrying the desired mutations generated by PCR with mutant primers. The resulting mutants were sequenced to confirm the desired mutation and subcloned into the Gal1-GST yeast expression vector pGREG546 to verify the expression of the mutant proteins by anti-GST immunoblot analysis. MEK1 is activated by phosphorylation at Ser218 and Ser222 in the regulatory loop between kinase subdomains VII and VIII. To better understand the regulation of MEK1 activity, we monitored the enzymatic activation and Ser218/Ser222 phosphorylation of MEK1 after serum stimulation of Rat1 fibroblasts. Detailed kinetic analysis revealed that MEK1 activation was very transient, reaching a peak at 5 min and returning to near basal levels by 15–30 min (Fig.1 A). A similar transient activation of endogenous MEK1/2 has been observed in other cell types (Ref. 23Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Google Scholar and data not shown). In contrast, the phosphorylation of activating Ser218/Ser222 residues, which was maximally induced at 3 min, was sustained for at least 3 h after serum addition (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that mechanisms other than dephosphorylation of regulatory Ser218/Ser222 residues must contribute to inactivation of MEK1. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis has revealed that MEK1 is phosphorylated on multiple peptides in both quiescent and serum-stimulated cells (Refs. 17Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Google Scholar and 26Brunet A. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 299-303Google Scholar and data not shown), suggesting that phosphorylation of residues other than the Ser218/Ser222 activation loop may also be involved in the regulation of the kinase. We initiated a series of experiments to identify new regulatory phosphorylation sites of MEK1. HEK 293 cells were transfected with HA-MEK1 and deprived of serum for 24 h. The cells were then metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 5 h, and ectopically expressed MEK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. After resolution by SDS-gel electrophoresis, the 32P-labeled MEK1 protein band was cut from the gel, alkylated, and subjected to complete in-gel trypsin digestion. The resulting tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC, and the fractions recovered were counted for radioactivity (Fig. 2 A). The radioactive fractions were subjected to automated Edman degradation, and the phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were analyzed using a sensitive capillary separation system. The fraction eluting at 49 min was found to contain the peptide LCDFGVSGQLIDXMAN(S)FV, which corresponds to the tryptic fragment Leu206–Arg227 of the human MEK1 sequence (Fig. 2 A). This peptide contains four potential phosphorylation sites: Ser212, Ser218, Ser222, and Thr226. To refine our analysis, the HPLC fractions containing the Leu206–Arg227 fragment were pooled and subjected to a second digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N, which cleaves before aspartate residues. Analysis of Asp-N digestion product by HPLC revealed the presence of a major radioactive peak (Fig.2 B). N-terminal sequencing of this peak yielded the sequence DFG, which corresponds to the double-digested peptide Asp208–Ile216. The only phosphorylatable residue within this peptide is Ser212. These results unambiguously demonstrate that MEK1 is phosphorylated at Ser212 in vivo. Alignment of MAPKK sequences from different species revealed that Ser212, which lies in the activation loop between kinase subdomains VII and VIII, is conserved in all members of the MAPKK family from yeast to mammals (Fig.3). However, this residue is not found in Raf MAPKKKs, MAPKs, cyclin-dependent kinases, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Notably, replacement of Ser212 with aspartic acid was shown to completely abolish the basal kinase activity of MEK1 in vitro (40Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuura J.E. Manning M.C. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Google Scholar). To evaluate the impact of Ser212 on the regulation of MEK1 activity in intact cells, we generated a series of MEK1 mutants by site-directed mutagenesis. The various HA-MEK1 constructs were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, and their phosphotransferase activity was measured using a specific ERK2 reactivation assay. Immunoblotting of total cell extracts with anti-HA antibody confirmed that all mutants were expressed to similar levels (Fig.4 A). Replacement of Ser212 with alanine significantly enhanced the enzymatic activity of MEK1 (from 3- to 5-fold) in exponentially growing HEK 293 cells, whereas mutation to the phosphomimetic acidic residue aspartate completely abolished it (Fig. 4 A). As previously reported, substitution of the activating phosphorylation sites Ser218and Ser222 with acidic residues (S218D/S222D) strongly potentiated the activity of MEK1, whereas substitution with alanine residues (S218A/S222A) impaired activation. Replacement of Ser212 with alanine did not further enhance the activity of the MEK1(S218D/S222D) mutant, nor did it rescue the compromised activation of the S218A/S222A mutant. However, substitution of Ser212 with aspartate completely abrogated the constitutive activation of the MEK1(S218D/S222D) mutant. We also tested whether the equivalent Ser216 residue of the related MAPKK MEK2 had similar regulatory effects. As shown in Fig. 4 B, replacement of Ser216 with alanine increased the basal activity of MEK2, whereas the aspartate mutation completely suppressed the activation of wild-type MEK2 and the constitutively activated MEK2(S222D/S226D) mutant.Figure 4Ser212 regulates the biological activity of MEK1 and MEK2. A and B, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged MEK1 or MEK2 constructs, respectively. After 48 h, the ectopically expressed MEK protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (α HA), and phosphotransferase activity was measured using an ERK2 reactivation assay. Expression of HA-tagged MEK1 and MEK2 proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody.C, HEK 293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for wild-type (wt) MEK1 or the indicated mutants in combination with Gal4-Elk-1 and the Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter gene. After 48 h, the activity of luciferase was measured and normalized to that of β-galactosidase. Results are presented as -fold activation over vector-transfected cells. All results are representative of four different experiments. MEK1 mutants:DD, S218D/S222D; AA, S218A/S222A; ADD, S212A/S218D/S222D; AAA, S212A/S218A/S222A; andDDD, S212D/S218D/S222D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the functional consequences of MEK1 regulation by Ser212, we tested the ability of MEK1 mutants to potentiate the transcriptional activation of the ERK1/2 target Elk-1 in exponentially growing HEK 293 cells. Under these experimental conditions, Elk-1-dependent reporter activity was not significantly enhanced by expression of the wild-type MEK1 protein (Fig. 4 C). However, expression of the MEK1(S212A) mutant caused a small but reproducible 2-fold stimulation of Elk-1 transcriptional activity. In agreement with the results of enzymatic assays, transfection of activated MEK1(S218D/S222D) strongly potentiated Elk-1-dependent transcription, and this effect was completely prevented by substitution of Ser212 with a phosphomimetic Asp residue. To further investigate the role of Ser212 in the regulation of MEK1 activity, we generated populations of Rat1 fibroblasts stably expressing HA-MEK1 Ser212 mutants. The cells were made quiescent by serum starvation and restimulated for different period of times with serum, and the activity of ectopically expressed MEK1 was measured. Similar to the endogenous protein, activation of ectopic MEK1 was transient, reaching a peak at 5 min and returning to basal levels by 30 min (Fig. 5 A). The MEK1(S212A) mutant displayed constitutive activity in serum-deprived cells. Stimulation with serum induced a further increase in MEK1(S212A) activity at 5 min, which declined thereafter, but remained elevated for at least 24 h. Mutation of Ser212 to Asp lowered the basal activity of MEK1 and abrogated activation of the enzyme by serum growth factors. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the mutants were expressed at levels comparable to the wild-type protein (Fig.5 B). These results are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of Ser212 plays a role in the regulation of MEK1/2 activity and of downstream signaling events. MEK1 is activated by phosphorylation of Ser218/Ser222 in the activation loop. We therefore tested whether the effects of Ser212 mutations on MEK1 activity could be related to differences in activating phosphorylation of the kinase. For these studies, HA-MEK1 constructs were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. The cells were serum-starved and restimulated with serum for 5 min, and the phosphorylation of MEK1 at Ser218/Ser222 was analyzed by immunoblotting using a phospho-specific antibody. Mutation of Ser212 to Ala or Asp did not affect the phosphorylation of MEK1 at activating Ser218/Ser222 residues in serum-stimulated cells (Fig. 6 A). We also investigated whether Ser212 mutations interfere with the ability of MEK1 to bind its substrates ERK1 and ERK2. Cell extracts prepared from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with HA-MEK1 constructs were incubated with His6-ERK2 beads, and the resulting complexes were analyzed by anti-HA immunoblotting. No differences were observed in the abilities of the various MEK1 mutants to bind ERK2 in this pull-down assay (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were obtained in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). These observations indicate that Ser212 mutations are unlikely to alter the global three-dimensional structure of the MEK1 enzyme. They also demonstrate that the inactivation of MEK1 observed upon mutation of Ser212 to a phosphomimetic residue cannot be explained by inhibition of activating loop phosphorylation or by interference with substrate binding. To determine whether the inhibitory mechanism of MAPKK regulation by phosphorylation has been conserved during evolution, we extended our studies to the yeast S. cerevisiae STE7 and PBS2 MAPKK genes (41Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Google Scholar). TheSTE7 and PBS2 gene products, Ste7p and Pbs2p, display significant amino acid sequence identity to mammalian MEK1/2. Ser212 in MEK1 corresponds to Ser353 in Ste7p and Ser508 in Pbs2p (Fig. 3). Mutations of the corresponding serine residues in Ste7p and Pbs2p were made by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting mutants were subcloned into a low copy yeast shuttle plasmid vector by in vivorecombination in yeast. The function of these alleles was tested in yeast strain W303-1AΔste7 for STE7-related functions and in yeast strain TM260 for PBS2-related functions. The mating ability of the yeast S. cerevisiae requires the function of Ste7p. Strain W303-1AΔste7 has no functionalSTE7 and therefore is unable to mate with a partner of opposite mating type. Transformation of the wild-type STE7gene into strain W303-1AΔste7 restores the mating ability of the cells, whereas the empty vector does not. Mutation of Ste7p Ser353 to alanine had no significant effect on mating efficiency (Fig. 7 A). However, substitution of Ser353 with a phosphomimetic aspartate residue led to a sterile phenotype, suggesting that Ste7p(S353D) is nonfunctional. To rule out the possibility that Ste7p(S353D) is not expressed or has decreased stability, the wild-type and mutant versions of Ste7p were expressed in yeast as GST fusion proteins and analyzed by immunoblotting. The results confirm that both the S353D and S353A mutants have steady-state levels of expression similar to those of wild-type Ste7p (data not shown). Corresponding mutations were also made in the PBS2 gene. The Pbs2p signaling pathway is required for the hyperosmolarity stress response, and cells defective in Pbs2p function are unable to grow on hyperosmotic medium. The sensitive yeast strain TM260 was transformed with different alleles of PBS2, and the transformants were tested for their ability to grow on hyperosmotic medium. Wild-type Pbs2p allowed the growth of the hyperosmolarity-sensitive cells on medium containing 0.9 m NaCl, and the S508A mutant displayed a similar phenotype (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, replacement of Ser508 with an aspartate residue blocked the growth of TM260 cells on hyperosmotic medium, suggesting that the S508D mutation, similar to the corresponding mutation in STE7, results in a nonfunctional allele of the MAPKK protein. This loss of function was not due to differences in expression levels, as both wild-type and mutant Pbs2p-GST fusion proteins were expressed at comparable levels (data not shown). It has been shown that substitution of Ser514 and Thr518 with phosphomimetic amino acid residues (either Glu or Asp) leads to constitutively activated forms of Pbs2p (42Bilsland-Marchesan E. Arino J. Saito H. Sunnerhagen P. Posas F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3887-3895Google Scholar). We changed these two residues to aspartate residues to obtain a constitutively activated Pbs2p kinase (Pbs2p(S514D/T518D)). Unlike wild-type Pbs2p, whose activity requires at least one of the upstream activating kinases Ssk2p, Ssk22p, or Ste11p, Pbs2p(S514D/T518D) was able to activate the HOG pathway independent of these activating kinases. To assess the regulatory effect of Ser508 on the constitutively activated Pbs2p(S514D/T518D) mutant, substitution of Ser508 with either Ala or Asp was made in combination with the S514D/T518D mutation. The resulting constructs were transformed into strains YCW340 (Δssk2 Δssk22 Δste11), YCW365 (Δssk2 Δssk22 Δste50), and YGJ208 (Δssk2 Δssk22 Δsho1) and tested for activation of the HOG pathway. As shown in Fig.7 B, the S508D mutation completely blocked the ability of Pbs2p(S514D/T518D) to activate the HOG pathway, whereas no significant effect of the S508A mutation was observed on Pbs2p(S514D/T518D) activity. These results indicate that the regulatory effect of Ser508 is dominant over the effect of activating phosphorylation of Pbs2p at Ser514 and Thr518. To test whether mutation of the dominant inhibitory phosphorylation site Ser508 to alanine is sufficient to render Pbs2p constitutively activated, wild-type Pbs2p, Pbs2p(S508A), and Pbs2p(S508D) were transformed into strains YCW340, YCW365, and YGJ208 and assayed for activation of the HOG pathway. As expected, no HOG pathway activity was observed in any strain transformed with Pbs2p(S508D) under all conditions tested (Fig. 7 B). This is consistent with previous observations thatSHO1-STE11/STE50 signaling is essential in the absence of the SLN1 two-component osmosensor branch that activates the MAPKKKs Ssk2p and Ssk22p (38Wu C. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2425-2440Google Scholar, 43Posas F. Saito H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Google Scholar). However, Pbs2p(S508A) displayed a significant increase inSHO1-independent HOG pathway activity, as judged by the ability of cells to grow in medium containing 0.9 m NaCl. However, this activity was not observed when either STE11 orSTE50 was deleted in the absence of SSK2 andSSK22. Thus, the HOG pathway activity observed wasSHO1-independent, but STE11- andSTE50-dependent. Enzymatic activation of MEK1 requires phosphorylation of Ser218 and Ser222 in the activation loop (7Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Google Scholar,8Zheng C.F. Guan K.-L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for MEK1/2 inactivation remain to be established. Our observation that sustained phosphorylation of MEK1 at regulatory Ser218/Ser222 residues contrasts with the transient nature of MEK1 activation in Rat1 fibroblasts led us to believe that mechanisms other than the simple involvement of protein phosphatases are involved in MEK1 inactivation. MEK1 is phosphorylated on multiple peptides in cells, suggesting that phosphorylation of residues other than Ser218 and Ser222 might be involved in other aspects of MEK1 regulation (17Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Google Scholar, 26Brunet A. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 299-303Google Scholar). Here, we have reported that MEK1 is phosphorylated at Ser212 in intact cells. Importantly, we have provided biochemical and genetic evidence that phosphorylation of the equivalent Ser212 residue in human MEK1 and MEK2 and in the yeast MAPKKs Ste7p and Pbs2p negatively regulates enzymatic activity in vivo. These findings suggest that both activation and inactivation of MAPKK family members are mediated by common evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. Replacement of Ser212 with acidic residues does not prevent activating phosphorylation of MEK1 at Ser218/Ser222, nor does it affect binding to ERK2 substrate, thereby suggesting that Ser212phosphorylation may directly interfere with the catalytic reaction. Consistent with this hypothesis, a previous study has shown that substitution of Ser212 with aspartate completely abolishes the basal kinase activity of MEK1 for exogenous substrates in vitro (40Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuura J.E. Manning M.C. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Google Scholar). Conversely, replacement of Ser212 was alanine was shown to increase the rate of autophosphorylation of recombinant MEK1 (44Xu S. Robbins D. Frost J. Dang A. Lange-Carter C. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6808-6812Google Scholar) and to enhance the basal phosphotransferase activity of MEK1-GST by 3–4-fold (8Zheng C.F. Guan K.-L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Google Scholar) in in vitro kinase assays. We also observed that the equivalent S212A mutation significantly increases the enzymatic activity of MEK1 and MEK2 in intact cells (Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that Ser212 is localized within the activation loop of MEK1, close to the activating phosphorylation sites. Although Ser212 phosphorylation does not interfere with phosphorylation of Ser218/Ser222, the presence of an additional phosphate group might compete for or establish undesirable electrostatic interactions with one or more basic residues in the catalytic domain. Thus, Ser212 phosphorylation may hinder the correct positioning of the aspartate residue essential for catalysis or perturb the conformation of the activation loop, blocking access of the substrate to the active site. Given the evolutionarily conserved nature of the MAPKK family, elucidation of the crystal structure of MEK1 in the inactive and active conformations will add greatly to our understanding of the mechanisms controlling both activation and inactivation of this family of enzymes. Studies by different groups have shown that MEK1 is also phosphorylated at Thr292, Ser298, and Thr386 in vivo (9Gotoh Y. Matsuda S. Takenaka K. Hattori S. Iwamatsu A. Ishikawa M. Kosako H. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1891-1898Google Scholar, 25Rossomando A.J. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Marshak D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1594-1602Google Scholar, 26Brunet A. Pages G. Pouyssegur J.

However, the exact biological consequences of these phosphorylation events remain to be established. It has been suggested that the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylate MEK1 at Thr292/Thr386 and inhibit its activation by a negative feedback mechanism (26Brunet A. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 299-303Google Scholar). In contrast, another study reported that the MEK1(T292A) mutant is inactivated more rapidly than wild-type MEK1 in serum-stimulated cells (17Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Google Scholar). We did not observe any effect of the T292A mutation on MEK1 activity in exponentially growing 293 cells (data not shown). In a more recent study, it was reported that Akt phosphorylates MKK4 at Ser78 and negatively regulates its activity by interfering with substrate binding (45Park H.S. Kim M.S. Huh S.H. Park J. Chung J. Kang S.S. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2573-2578Google Scholar). MKK4 is the only member of the mammalian MAPKK family that has a consensus Akt phosphorylation motif. It is likely that MAPKKs are regulated by phosphorylation mechanisms common to all members as well as by more subtle mechanisms that allow differential regulation of individual isoforms. Identification of the physiological kinases and phosphatases that control the phosphorylation level of Ser212 and other regulatory sites will be necessary for a complete understanding of MAPKK regulation.

Recently, a novel serine-threonine kinase of the protein kinase C (PKC) family has been described and designated as PKCν. PKCν has two putative diacylglycerol binding C1 domains, suggesting that it may participate in a novel diacylglycerol-mediated signaling pathway. Here we show that both endogenous and recombinant PKCν are trans-located to the plasma membrane and activated by the diacylglycerol mimic phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Mutational analysis demonstrates that PKCν activation is dependent on trans-phosphorylation of two conserved activation loop serine residues. We also find that PKCν is an important physiologic target of the B-cell receptor (BCR), because PKCν is found to be abundantly expressed in chicken and human B-cell lines and, in addition, exhibits robust activation after BCR engagement. Genetic and pharmacologic analyses of BCR-mediated PKCν activation indicate that it requires intact phospholipase Cγ and PKC signaling pathways. Furthermore, in co-transfection assays, PKCν can be trans-phosphorylated by the novel PKC isozymes PKCε, PKCη, or PKCθ but not the classical PKC enzyme, PKCα. Taken together, these results suggest that PKCν is an important component of signaling pathways downstream from novel PKC enzymes after B-cell receptor engagement.

One of the earliest detectable events following engagement of lymphocyte antigen and Fc receptors is activation of the phospholipase C isozyme γ (PLCγ) 1The abbreviations used are: PLCγ, phospholipase C isozyme γ; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; PKD, protein kinase D; BCR, B-cell receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AEBSF, 4-(2′-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (reviewed in Refs. 1Clements J.L.

Activated PLCγ acts to hydrolyze the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, resulting in the generation of the second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Soluble inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate diffuses through the cytoplasm to bind to and gate inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate receptor ion channels expressed on intracellular calcium store membranes, thereby initiating a general increase in cytosolic Ca2+, which is a critical component of antigen and Fc receptor cell activation signals (reviewed in Refs. 6Krauss S.

In contrast, DAG remains associated with cellular membranes and serves as an essential cofactor in the assembly of a functional “signalsome” in the subplasmalemmal region beneath engaged receptors. Whereas a large body of evidence from studies of PLCγ and PKC signaling indicates that the DAG-dependent component of antigen and Fc receptor signals influence diverse aspects of immune cell biology (2Kurosaki T.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 780-786Google Scholar), understanding the molecular mechanisms through which DAG acts requires a detailed knowledge of the direct targets of DAG and how they are influenced by the production of DAG following receptor engagement. A novel serine-threonine kinase with two potential DAG-binding C1 domains has recently been cloned and designated PKCν, but its activation mechanism and the identity of cell surface receptors that utilize its signaling capacity remain uncharacterized. As our initial analyses indicated that PKCν is abundantly expressed in human B-cells, we investigated whether PKCν was involved in signals mediated by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). Utilizing a combination of biochemical, genetic, and pharmacologic approaches, here we show that PKCν is a downstream effector for BCR-mediated DAG production and that its activation mechanism probably involves DAG-mediated membrane trans-location followed by trans-phosphorylation of two conserved residues within its “activation loop” by novel PKC enzymes. Constitutively active PKC mutants were obtained from David Rawlings (Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington) and Peter Parker (Protein Phosphorylation Laboratory, Cancer Research UK). An M2 FLAG monoclonal antibody covalently coupled to agarose beads was from Sigma. A polyclonal antibody recognizing the carboxyl-terminal 16 residues of human and chicken PKCν (HFIMAPNPDDMEEDP) was generated by standard immunological techniques and affinity-purified against the immunizing peptide. Monoclonal PKC antibodies and a V5 epitope antibody were from Transduction Laboratories and Invitrogen, respectively. A polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes a phosphorylated serine 735 residue in the activation loop of PKCν was obtained from Doreen Cantrell (Lymphocyte Activation Laboratory, Cancer Research UK). This antibody is directed against a phosphorylated epitope that is conserved in all three members of the PKD kinase family. F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-human IgM were from Jackson Laboratories. A monoclonal-stimulating antibody recognizing the chicken BCR (M4) was purified from hybridoma supernatant using standard procedures. The classical/novel PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8025 was from Calbiochem. All of the other reagents were from standard suppliers or as indicated in the text. Human Raji and Ramos and mouse A20 B-cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μm 2-β-mercaptoethanol. Chicken DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. HEK 293 endothelial cells expressing the TET Repressor protein were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 5 μg/ml blasticidin. Transient transfection of HEK 293 cells was carried out using a Beckman Gene-Pulser electroporation apparatus. 1 × 107cells/0.5 ml serum-free media were pulsed in 0.4-cm cuvettes with 10 μg of plasmid DNA at 330 volts and 1000 microfarads before diluting with 10 ml of complete medium. Cells were allowed to recover overnight before experimental use. For transfection of A20 B-cells, the electroporation conditions used were 250 volts and 950 microfarads. The PKCν coding sequence was PCR-amplified from a human brain cDNA library (Clontech) using 5′-ACGTGCGGCCGCTGTCTGCAAATAATTCCCCTCCATCAGCCCAG-3′ forward and 5′-ACGTTCTAGATTAAGGATCTTCTTCCATATCATCTGGATTAGG-3′ reverse primers. The PCR fragment was subclonedNotI/XbaI (sites are underlined) into a modified pcDNA4/TO doxycycline-inducible mammalian expression vector. This modified vector contains an in-frame FLAG epitope coding sequence, resulting in the expression of an amino-terminally tagged FLAG-PKCν protein. A similar method was used to construct the pcDNA4/TO FLAG-PKD vector. To generate the pcDNA4/TO GFP-PKCν construct, the coding sequence for GFP was PCR-amplified with 5′-HindIII and 3′-NotI restriction sites. This PCR fragment was then cloned into the pcDNA4/TO vector, and the PKCν coding sequence was cloned in-frame COOH-terminal to the GFP sequence using NotI and XbaI restriction sites. PKCα, PKCε, and PKCθ mutants were cloned into a modified pcDNA5/TO vector with an in-frame amino-terminal V5 epitope tag. Site-specific mutations within the catalytic domain of PKCν, resulting in single or double amino acid substitutions, were generated by overlap PCR using wild-type PKCν as the template. Mutants were generated using the above primers together with internal forward and reverse primers complementary to each other and containing specific nucleotide substitutions as required. Primers (forward sequence only shown) containing the desired mutation(s) (underlined) were as follows: PKCν-K605N, 5′-GGGAGGGATGTGGCTATTAACGTAATTGATAAGATGAG-3′; PKCν-S731A/S735A, 5′-CATTGGTGAAAAGGCATTCAGGAGAGCTGTGGTAGGAACTCCAGC-3′; and PKCν-S731E/S735E, 5′- CATTGGTGAAAAGGAATTCAGGAGAGAGGTGGTAGGAACTCCAGC-3′. Following the second PCR reaction, the amplified cDNAs were subcloned (NotI/XbaI) into the modified pcDNA4/TO expression vector. Constructs were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer before they were used in transient expression experiments. Protein expression was induced by treating cells with 5 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, 1 mm AEBSF, and 1% Triton X-100. Exogenously expressed PKCν was immunoprecipitated with either a FLAG monoclonal antibody or with an affinity-purified PKCν antibody recovered with protein G-Sepharose beads and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 6% SDS, 0.5 m EDTA, 4% 2-β mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Immunoprecipitates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and Western blotted with appropriate antibodies. DT40 B-cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold fractionation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, 1 mm AEBSF). Cells were lysed by homogenization, and unbroken cells/nuclear debris were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to high speed ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, resulting in a soluble cytosolic fraction and an insoluble membrane pellet. The membrane pellet was solubilized in 1 ml of fractionation buffer containing 1% Triton-X for 20 min at 4 °C before insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. PKCν was then immunoprecipitated from both cytosolic and membrane fractions and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunocomplexes were washed twice in lysis buffer (described above) and once in kinase buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2). PKCν autophosphorylation was determined by incubating immunocomplexes with 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For immunofluorescent localization of endogenous PKCν, DT40 B-cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to attach to polylysine-coated glass bottom dishes (MatTek Inc.). The cells were then left untreated or treated with 50 ng/ml PMA for 10 min before fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then permeabilized with a 0.5% saponin buffer and sequential incubation with primary (anti-PKCν, 1 μg/ml) and secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 1:3000 dilution) for 20 min. After each step, the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. For GFP visualization, A20 B-cells transiently expressing GFP-PKCν were plated on polylysine-coated glass bottom dishes in phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to adhere before stimulation with 50 ng/ml PMA. The cells were excited with a 495-nm wavelength light, and emitted light was imaged using an IMAGO CCD camera set for a 2-s exposure using a Zeiss microscope and TillVision software. All of the experiments presented a representative of two to three independent experiments. Although the PKCν gene and transcripts have been described previously (17Hayashi A. Seki N. Hattori A. Kozuma S. Saito T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 99-106Google Scholar), there is no present literature regarding its regulation or receptor systems that utilize PKCν as a signaling mechanism. However, PKCν has two putative C1 domains. These domains (see schematic in Fig. 1 A) of ∼50 residues are thought to bind the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol, suggesting that PKCν might participate in a diacylglycerol-mediated signaling pathway. As the tumor-promoting phorbol esters serve as pharmacological substitutes for DAG and mimic many aspects of the biological activity of DAG, we used one of them, PMA, to evaluate the potential involvement of PKCν in DAG signaling by imaging the subcellular localization of PKCν in cells that had been left untreated or treated with PMA (Fig. 1 B). As can be seen, both endogenous PKCν (imaged in fixed and antibody-stained cells, top panels) and GFP-tagged PKCν (imaged in live cells, bottom panels) are substantially redistributed from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to PMA treatment, consistent with DAG serving as a membrane recruitment signal for PKCν. Recruitment to the plasma membrane often serves as a means for activation of protein kinases, and PMA has previously been shown to induce both membrane recruitment and activation of PKD1, one of the closest homologues of PKCν (18Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Google Scholar, 19Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Google Scholar). To understand how membrane recruitment affects PKCν function, we produced a FLAG-tagged PKCν construct as a backbone for mutational analysis of PKCν activation and confirmed its expression after transfection of HEK 293 cells (Fig.1 C, left panel). The treatment of cells expressing FLAG-PKCν with PMA induced easily detectable enzymatic activation as measured by an in vitro kinase assay (Fig.1 C, right panel, top blot). For many serine-threonine kinases, phosphorylation within the activation loop serves as a marker for enzymatic activation. The putative activation loop residues of PKCν are serines 731 and 735. Therefore, we utilized an antibody targeted specifically at phosphoserine 735 and its surrounding region to analyze activation loop phosphorylation of FLAG-PKCν. Anti-pS735 immunoreactivity strongly correlated with the activation state of FLAG-PKCν, suggesting a role for phosphorylation of this residue during PKCν activation (Fig. 1 C,right panel, middle blot). We further utilized anti-pS735 to examine at the activation of endogenous PKCν. As our initial analyses (data not shown) had indicated the presence of abundant PKCν in several B-cell lines, we evaluated whether PMA treatment could activate endogenous PKCν in chicken DT40 B-cells and the Raji and Ramos human B-cell lines (Fig. 1 D). As can be seen, PMA treatment strongly induced anti-pS735 immunoreactivity of anti-PKCν immunoprecipitates, indicating that endogenous PKCν is activated by PMA in the same manner as the recombinant FLAG-PKCν. To further investigate the role of pS735 phosphorylation in PKCν activation, we constructed a kinase-deficient mutant of PKCν on the FLAG-PKCν backbone via the mutation of a conserved lysine residue within the putative ATP-binding cassette of the kinase domain (FLAG-PKCν-KN). This mutant had no detectable kinase activity as assessed by an in vitro kinase assay (Fig.2 A, top panel). However, a comparison of the anti-pS735 immunoreactivity induced by PMA treatment of wild-type FLAG-PKCν with that of the FLAG-PKCν-KN mutant demonstrated essentially intact phosphorylation of this site (Fig. 2 A), indicating that this site is trans-phosphorylated by an upstream kinase in intact cells. In some proteins whose function is modulated by phosphorylation at serine or threonine residues, the replacement of the regulatory serine or threonine residues with negatively charged glutamate or aspartate residues induces the protein to act as if it is constitutively phosphorylated at the mutated sites. Conversely, the replacement with alanine produces a protein whose function can no longer be modulated by phosphorylation. Therefore, we further analyzed the activation mechanism PKCν by producing mutants on the FLAG-PKCν backbone with potentially activating mutations at positions 731 and 735 (serine to glutamate, S731E/S735E) or deactivating mutations (serine to alanine at the same positions, S731A/S735A) and analyzing their responses to PMA treatment (Fig.2 B). Although the S731A/S735A mutant is no longer activated by PMA, the S731E/S735E mutant shows high constitutive activity that is PMA-independent, indicating that phosphorylation at serines 731 and 735 is both necessary and sufficient for PKCν activation. When viewed in conjunction with the redistribution to the plasma membrane induced by PMA treatment, a compelling model for PKCν activation can be constructed in which its activation occurs as the result of its membrane trans-location and subsequent trans-phosphorylation by an upstream PMA-regulated protein kinase on serine 731/735. Based on its abundance in B-cells, its activation by the DAG mimic PMA and the well established role of PLCγ in B-cell antigen receptor signal transduction, we next investigated whether PKCν was activated after B-cell antigen receptor engagement. The engagement of the BCR on either chicken DT40 B-cells (Fig.3 A) or human Raji and Ramos human B-cells (Fig. 3 B) induced strong and rapid activation of PKCν as assessed by the induction of anti-pS735 immunoreactivity. To address the question of where activated PKCν is localized within the cell, fractionation experiments were preformed in both PMA and BCR-stimulated B cells. As illustrated in Fig. 3 C, PKCν trans-locates from the cytosol to the membrane fraction in response to PMA treatment (Fig. 3 C, lower panels), consistent with the observation that PMA induces the trans-location of GFP-PKCν from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (see Fig. 1 B). In addition, pS735 immunoblotting reveals that activated PKCν is restricted to the membrane fraction of PMA-treated B-cells (Fig.3 C, upper panels). In contrast, a portion of PKCν trans-locates to the membrane fraction of BCR-stimulated B-cells, and activated PKCν is detectable in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions (Fig. 3 C). Kinetic analysis indicates that PKCν rapidly redistributes from the cytosol to the membrane compartment of B-cells in response to BCR ligation (within <30 s) and that activated PKCν is found in cytosolic and membrane compartments both at early (<30 s) and late (≥10 min) time points (data not shown). That the activation of PKCν by BCR ligation is entirely dependent on PLCγ activation was demonstrated through the use of DT40 B-cell lines engineered to be deficient in individual components of the signaling cascade, leading to PLCγ activation (Fig.4 A). Lyn-deficient DT40 cells have intact but delayed PLCγ activation (20Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Google Scholar). They also exhibit relatively intact but delayed activation of PKCν (peak activation occurs at >10 min as opposed to ∼1 min in wild-type DT40 cells). This closely tracks the published time course of PLCγ activation as measured by inositol phosphate turnover (20Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Google Scholar). In contrast, DT40 cell lines deficient in BLNK, BTK, and PLCγ2, each of which have completely abrogated PLCγ activation (reviewed in Ref.21Kurosaki T. Maeda A. Ishiai M. Hashimoto A. Inabe K. Takata M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 19-29Google Scholar), show completely abrogated PKCν activation. Note that in addition PMA-mediated PKCν activation is intact in all of the DT40 cell lines tested, eliminating the possibility that direct effects of the deficiency of these proteins might be affecting PKCν activation. Consistent with these results (Fig. 4 B), the treatment of cells with the putative DAG antagonist calphostin C also abrogated BCR-mediated PKCν activation in chicken and human B-cells. The above results demonstrate that PLCγ is a probable source of DAG for BCR-mediated PKCν activation. Because DAG would plausibly serve to membrane target and activate both classical and novel PKC enzymes in the same general microdomain area(s) as PKCν would be localized, we investigated whether either of these classes of enzymes might serve as an upstream activating kinase for PKCν. Consistent with this possibility, the treatment of B-cells with the classical/novel PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8025 completely blocked BCR-mediated PKCν activation (Fig.5 A). Whereas this inhibitor is thought to be relatively specific for the classical and novel classes of PKC enzymes relative to other serine/threonine kinases (including PKD1, the closest homologue of PKCν (22Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2075-2082Google Scholar)), the use of inhibitors is always open to questions regarding specificity within the cellular environment. Therefore, to further evaluate the role of PKC-dependent trans-phosphorylation as an activation mechanism for PKCν, we tested the ability of activated mutants of various PKC subtypes to induce PKCν phosphorylation (and thus activation) in a heterologous expression assay. The expression of constitutively activated mutants of novel PKC isozymes (η, ε, and θ) produced robust constitutive activation of PKCν in the absence of PMA stimulation (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, the co-expression of kinase-deficient or wild-type PKCε or PKCθ had little or no effect on basal or PMA-induced activation of PKCν. Interestingly, the expression of a constitutively activated classical PKC enzyme, PKCα, produced no detectable change in either constitutive or PMA-induced PKCν activation (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that PKCν is a poor substrate for PKCα and potentially other classical PKC isoforms. We have analyzed the activation mechanism of the novel serine-threonine kinase PKCν and show that PKCν is activated by PMA and BCR-mediated DAG production via the trans-phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser 731 and Ser 735) within its activation loop. The ability of activated mutants of novel PKC isozymes but not the classical PKC enzyme, PKCα, to induce constitutive PKCν activation suggests that this trans-phosphorylation event may be mediated primarily by novel PKC enzymes. As PKCν exhibits robust activation in response to BCR engagement, our results suggest that PKCν is an important downstream target of activated novel PKC enzymes during BCR signaling. The closest homologues of PKCν are PKD1/PKCμ and PKD2, and together these three kinases form a distinct protein kinase subfamily. They share a predicted tertiary structure that includes two C1 domains contained in their amino-terminal halves, a single central pH domain, and closely homologous kinase domains in their COOH-terminal halves. Consistent with their structural similarity to PKCν, PKD1 and PKD2 (similar to PKCν) appear to act downstream from both DAG and protein kinase C enzymes. Although the data in this paper suggest that PKCν appears to relatively specifically targeted by novel PKC isoforms, PKD1 and PKD2 are activated by both classical and novel PKCs (19Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Google Scholar, 23Van Lint J.V. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Google Scholar, 24Yuan J. Bae D.

A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Google Scholar). From the standpoint of their catalytic domains, these three kinases are only distantly related to the ACG kinases (consisting of the PKA, PKC, and PKG protein kinase families). Instead, their kinase domains exhibit the closest sequence similarity to those of calcium-regulated kinases (25Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, small peptides phosphorylated by PKD1 in vitro do not appear to significantly overlap with those phosphorylated by classical/novel PKC enzymes (23Van Lint J.V. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Google Scholar, 26Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Bottinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Google Scholar), suggesting that PKCν/PKD1/PKD2 substrates represent distinct signaling pathways downstream from DAG and PKCs. Whether PKD1, PKD2, and PKCν share similar substrate ranges or downstream biological effector functions remains to be demonstrated. However, their position downstream from novel PKCs suggests that one or more of them is involved in linking novel PKC activation with effector responses downstream from the BCR in B-cells. In this regard, a recent report (14Mecklenbrauker I. Saijo K. Zheng N.Y. Leitges M. Tarakhovsky A. Nature. 2002; 416: 860-865Google Scholar) has implicated the novel PKC isoform PKCδ in controlling the mechanisms of anergy and tolerance in B-cells. Because PKD1 and PKCν are both expressed in B-cells and appear to be targets of novel PKC enzymes, either one or both could plausibly function as a link between PKCδ (and possibly other novel PKC enzymes) and downstream effectors and mechanisms involved in the creation of B-cell energy and tolerance. Determining whether PKCν and/or its homologues operate in this pathway or an alternative signaling pathway will depend on the future development of genetic or pharmacologic tools for the manipulation of their signaling function.

https://openalex.org/W2119567071,"KpnI DNA-(N 6-adenine)-methyltransferase (KpnI MTase) is a member of a restriction-modification (R-M) system in Klebsiella pneumoniae and recognizes the sequence 5′-GGTACC-3′. It modifies the recognition sequence by transferring the methyl group fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to theN 6 position of adenine residue.KpnI MTase occurs as a dimer in solution as shown by gel filtration and chemical cross-linking analysis. The nonlinear dependence of methylation activity on enzyme concentration indicates that the functionally active form of the enzyme is also a dimer. Product inhibition studies with KpnI MTase showed thatS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine is a competitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet and noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to DNA. The methylated DNA showed noncompetitive inhibition with respect to both DNA and AdoMet. A reduction in the rate of methylation was observed at high concentrations of duplex DNA. The kinetic analysis where AdoMet binds first followed by DNA, supports an ordered bi bi mechanism. After methyl transfer, methylated DNA dissociates followed byS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine. Isotope-partitioning analysis showed that KpnI MTase-AdoMet complex is catalytically active. KpnI DNA-(N 6-adenine)-methyltransferase (KpnI MTase) is a member of a restriction-modification (R-M) system in Klebsiella pneumoniae and recognizes the sequence 5′-GGTACC-3′. It modifies the recognition sequence by transferring the methyl group fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to theN 6 position of adenine residue.KpnI MTase occurs as a dimer in solution as shown by gel filtration and chemical cross-linking analysis. The nonlinear dependence of methylation activity on enzyme concentration indicates that the functionally active form of the enzyme is also a dimer. Product inhibition studies with KpnI MTase showed thatS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine is a competitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet and noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to DNA. The methylated DNA showed noncompetitive inhibition with respect to both DNA and AdoMet. A reduction in the rate of methylation was observed at high concentrations of duplex DNA. The kinetic analysis where AdoMet binds first followed by DNA, supports an ordered bi bi mechanism. After methyl transfer, methylated DNA dissociates followed byS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine. Isotope-partitioning analysis showed that KpnI MTase-AdoMet complex is catalytically active. DNA methyltransferase S-adenosylmethionine S-adenosylhomocysteine diethylaminoethyl ion-exchange filters restriction-modification DNA MTase Prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases (MTases)1 are usually components of restriction-modification (R-M) systems that enable cells to resist propagation of foreign genomes that would otherwise kill them (1Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2539-2566Google Scholar). DNA methylation is catalyzed byS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent DNA methyltransferases. Based on the position of methyl group transfer on bases in DNA, DNA MTases are classified into two groups, exocyclic or amino methyltransferases and endocyclic or ring methyltransferases (2Ahmad I. Rao D.N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 361-380Google Scholar). The amino methyltransferases methylate exocyclic amino nitrogen and form eitherN 6 methyladenine or N 4methylcytosine, whereas ring methyltransferases methylate ring carbon and form C 5 methylcytosine. All exocyclic MTases share a common architectural plan. They have nine highly conserved motifs, and these can be arranged in different combinations (3Dryden D.T.F. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases: Structure and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 283-340Google Scholar). The amino methyltransferases are further subdivided into three groups, namely α, β, and γ, which are characterized by a distinct linear order of the AdoMet binding region (FXGXG), target recognition domain, and catalytic (DPPY) motif. Target recognition domains are long sequences containing no conserved amino acids. The low amino acid sequence similarity between target recognition domains explains the specificity of a particular methyltransferase for a specific sequence. Several type I and type II R-M systems have been isolated from strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. These include KpnI,KpnK14I (an isoschizomer of KpnI),Kpn2I (an isoschizomer of BspMII),Kpn49kI (an isoschizomer of EcoRI),Kpn49kII (an isoschizomer of NciI), and various yet unnamed enzymes that are isoschizomers of EcoRII,BssHII, and PstI (4Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2331-2365Google Scholar). Although the type I systems includes KpnAI (5Sook Lee N. Rutebuka O. Arakawa T. Bickle T.A. Ryu J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 342-348Google Scholar) and KpnBI (6Valinluck B. Sook Lee N. Ryu J. Gene. 1995; 167: 59-62Google Scholar), KpnI restriction-modification system belongs to the type II R-M systems. The genes for KpnI endonuclease and methyltransferase are present within close proximity to each other in K. pneumoniae genome (7Chatterjee D.K. Hammond A.W. Blakesley R.W. Adams S.M. Gerard G.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6505-6509Google Scholar). KpnI MTase recognizes the recognition sequence 5′-GGTACC-3′ (8Hammond A.W. Gerard G.F. Chatterjee D.K. Gene. 1990; 97: 97-102Google Scholar) and modifies the DNA by methylating the adenine residue at the N 6position (9Kiss A. Finta C. Venetianer P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3460Google Scholar). Based on the conserved motif arrangement, KpnI MTase belongs to the β-subgroup of MTases. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of KpnI MTase with the sequences of various MTases revealed a significant homology withN 6-adenine MTases and partial homology withN 4-cytosine MTases but no sequence homology withC 5-cytosine MTases. Dot matrix comparison ofKpnI MTase with several N 6-adenine MTases and N 4-cytosine MTases showed that it has homology with the catalytic motif (DPPY) and AdoMet binding motif (FXGXG) of most N 6-adenine MTases and only the FXGXG region ofN 4-cytosine MTases. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of KpnI MTase is more closely related to those of EcoP1 MTase and EcoP15I MTase, which belong to type III R-M systems (7Chatterjee D.K. Hammond A.W. Blakesley R.W. Adams S.M. Gerard G.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6505-6509Google Scholar). Among all the MTases characterized so far, most of them are monomers, whereas their cognate endonucleases are dimers. Kinetic mechanisms of C 5 MTases such asHhaI (10Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol.

All known cytosine methyltransferases studied so far follow an ordered bi bi mechanism with DNA as the leading substrate. Kinetic mechanisms for members of the N 4 cytosine MTase family such as PvuII and N 6-adenine MTases such as EcoP15I (18Rao D.N. Page M.G. Bickle T.A. J. Mol.

Our aim is to study the interaction between DNA and KpnI MTase by kinetic analysis of the enzymatic reaction. In the present study we report the oligomeric nature of KpnI MTase using gel filtration, chemical cross-linking, and enzyme concentration-dependent analysis. The kinetic parameters for methylation reaction with DNA substrates of different length byKpnI MTase have been determined. We also report the order of substrate binding and product release using initial velocity dependence analysis, product inhibition, substrate inhibition, and steady state kinetic analysis. Our results demonstrate that KpnI MTase exists as a dimer in solution and functions as a dimer during the methylation reaction. The methylation reaction proceeds through a steady state ordered bi bi kinetic mechanism in which AdoMet binds first followed by DNA.

Babu P. Nagaraja V. J. Biosci. 1999; 24: 269-277Google Scholar). Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs.S-Adenosyl-l-[3H]methionine (78.9 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and AdoMet, chloramphenicol, bovine serum albumin, HEPES, polyethyleneimine, Coomassie Brilliant Blue, RNase A, glutaraldehyde, andS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) were purchased from Sigma. AdoHcy was prepared by dissolving 38.44 mg into 1 ml of 1 n HCl to give a 100 mm solution. Dilutions were made fresh in distilled water. Phosphocellulose P11 and DE81 anion-exchange filter papers were purchased from Whatman. All other chemicals used were of highest grade purity. Centricon 10 microconcentrator units were purchased from Amicon. Oligonucleotides for methylation assays were purchased from Microsynth GmbH, Switzerland and Bangalore Genei Pvt. Ltd., India. Oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Fig. 1. Double-stranded DNA concentration was measured spectrophotometrically, assuming an A 260 of 1.0 to correspond to 50 μg/ml for double-stranded DNA. KpnI methyltransferase was expressed in E. coli DH10B cells containing plasmid pACMK (27Chandrashekaran S. Babu P. Nagaraja V. J. Biosci. 1999; 24: 269-277Google Scholar). E. coli cells harboringKpnI MTase clone pACMK were grown for 12–16 h at 37 °C in LB medium containing 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. Harvested cells (10 g) were suspended in 20 ml of buffer A (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 7 mm β mercaptoethanol) and sonicated. Care was taken that the temperature during sonication was maintained at 4 °C. Unless indicated otherwise, all steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. The sonicated cell suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 2 h. The crude extract was treated with 1% (v/v) polyethyleneimine in the presence of 250 mm KCl. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, and the supernatant was subjected to 0–30% ammonium sulfate fractionation. The pellet was dissolved in buffer A, dialyzed, and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column previously equilibrated with buffer A. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1-1 m KCl. Fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). Dialyzed sample was loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer B and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m KCl. Fractions containing enzyme were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B containing 50% glycerol, and the enzyme was stored at −20 °C. The purity of the protein was judged as being greater than 99% on SDS-PAGE, and the yield of purifiedKpnI MTase from 10 g of cells was ∼5 mg. PurifiedKpnI MTase was stable for at least 3 months at −20 °C. Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. All methylation assays monitored incorporation of tritiated methyl groups into DNA by using a modified ion-exchange filter assay (29Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7265-7272Google Scholar). Reactions contained 100 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 11 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Enzyme and substrate concentrations (DNA and AdoMet) were used as noted in each experiment. After the incubation of enzyme and substrates at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by transferring aliquots onto small Whatman DE81 filter paper discs. Filters were washed 3 times (5 min each) with 0.2 mammonium bicarbonate solution equilibrated at 4 °C, once with 95% (v/v) ethanol, and once with diethyl ether. Filters were air-dried, and the tritium content was determined in 3 ml of scintillation fluid (0.5% 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 0.05% 1,4-bis[2-(5-phenyl-oxazoyl)] benzene in 1:1 (v/v) 2-methoxyethanol and toluene) using an LKB Rack BETA model II liquid scintillation counter. All data are corrected for nonspecific binding of [3H]AdoMet to the washed filter. Background counts were measured at zero-time incubation, the incubation in the absence of enzyme was subtracted (less than 100 cpm), and data were analyzed. The amount of enzyme that transferred 1 nmol of [3H]methyl group to the substrate DNA was, thus, obtained. One unit of KpnI MTase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that incorporated 1 nmol of [3H]methyl group into the DNA/min at saturating concentrations of substrates at 37 °C. The specific activity of KpnI MTase is referred to as units/mol of protein; that is, nmol of [3H]methyl groups/min/mol of protein. Native molecular mass of KpnI MTase was determined by gel filtration analysis and performed on a Superdex 200 column in buffer B. To determine the molecular mass of KpnI MTase, the column was calibrated with suitable molecular weight markers ranging from 12 to 150 kDa. The void volume (V o) of the column was found to be 40 ml, and the bed volume was 120 ml. The elution volumes (V e) of marker proteins and KpnI MTase were determined. The molecular mass of KpnI MTase was calculated from the plot ofV e/V o versus log molecular weight. KpnI MTase (4.44 μm) was incubated on ice for 15 min. Increasing amounts of glutaraldehyde were then added to the protein solution to a final concentration range of 0.05–0.5%, and the mixture was further incubated on ice for 1 h. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (0.1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide) and visualized by silver-staining. Preincubation experiments were carried out by incubating 1 μm KpnI MTase with either 1 μm DNA or 2 μm[3H-methyl]AdoMet at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by adding AdoMet or DNA, respectively. At 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-s time intervals, 20-μl aliquots were removed and analyzed for product formation using the DE81 filter binding assay. In a control experiment, AdoMet and DNA were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was started with KpnI MTase. Kinetic studies were done using pUC18 supercoiled plasmid DNA. Methylation assays were carried out as described earlier for 2.5 min to determine initial velocity dependence. In a series of similar reactions containingKpnI MTase (1 μm) and [3H]AdoMet (2 μm), the concentration of DNA was varied in the range of 50 nm–1 μm. A double reciprocal plot of the initial velocity versus DNA concentration allowed the determination of K mDNA andV max. Similarly, initial velocity experiments were carried out by varying the concentration of [3H]AdoMet in the range of 50 nm–2 μm while keeping the DNA concentration fixed at 1 μm and keeping other reaction conditions identical. The double reciprocal plot of initial velocity versus[3H]AdoMet concentration allowed the determination ofK mAdoMet andV max. The turnover number (k cat) was calculated as the ratio ofV max to the enzyme concentration used. The kinetic constants were also calculated for theScaI-linearized pUC18 DNA, unmethylated oligonucleotide (38-mer), and hemimethylated oligonucleotide (38-mer). Data obtained were plotted by regression analysis using Sigma Plot. The equations used to obtain the kinetic constants, V max,K mDNA K mAdoMet, andk cat were as described (30Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 208Google Scholar, 31Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press Ltd., London1995: 19Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, all enzyme activity data were the average of at least triplicate determinations. Methylation assays were carried out to determine the initial velocity dependence of DNA and AdoMet as described earlier. In a series of identical reactions containing 1 μm KpnI MTase and 250 nm AdoMet, the concentration of the substrate DNA was varied in the range of 50 nm–1 μm. Initial velocities were obtained at different fixed concentrations of [3H]AdoMet (500 nm and 1, 1.5, and 2 μm). The reaction mixture was incubated for 2.5 min at 37 °C. Similarly, by varying the concentration of [3H]AdoMet in the range of 50 nm–2 μm, other reaction conditions remaining identical, methylation assays were carried out to determine initial velocities. Initial velocities were obtained at various fixed concentration of DNA (250, 500, and 750 nm and 1 μm). The double reciprocal plot allowed determination of the dependence of DNA on AdoMet and vice versa. While determining initial velocities, the product formed was measured under such conditions that overall inhibition of the reaction by AdoHcy was less than 5%. Methylated DNA was obtained for inhibition studies as follows. pUC18 supercoiled plasmid DNA was incubated with KpnI MTase (2 μm) and AdoMet (5 μm) at 37 °C for 1 h. Methylated DNA was extracted twice with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with absolute ethanol, and dried. The concentration of DNA estimated, and the DNA was used. Methylation of DNA was further confirmed by restriction digestion with KpnI endonuclease. Product inhibition studies were done under identical conditions as described for initial velocity dependence experiments. Inhibition by AdoHcy was studied using 1 μm pUC18 supercoiled plasmid DNA (fixed concentration) while keeping the AdoHcy concentrations fixed (0, 1, 5, and 10 μm) and varying the concentration of [3H]AdoMet from 50 nm to 2 μmfor each of the fixed concentrations of AdoHcy. Similarly, another series of identical reactions included 2 μm[3H]AdoMet (fixed concentration); AdoHcy concentrations fixed at 0, 1, 5, and 10 μm and DNA concentration varied in the range of 50 nm–1 μm for each of the fixed concentration of AdoHcy. Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus [3H]AdoMet or DNA concentrations were obtained at each concentration of the AdoHcy.K i AdoHcy was determined from these double reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus AdoMet concentration followed by secondary plots with their intercepts (data not shown). For inhibition by methylated DNA, the unmethylated DNA concentration was kept constant at 1 μm, and AdoMet concentration was varied in the range of 50 nm–2 μm against each of the chosen methylated DNA concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, and 2 μm). Similarly, another series of identical reactions was performed at a fixed concentration of [3H]AdoMet (2 μm) and varying concentrations of unmethylated DNA ranging from 50 nm to 1 μm against each of the fixed concentrations of methylated DNA (0, 0.5, 1, and 2 μm). Double reciprocal plots were generated from these data, andK i of methylated DNA was estimated using secondary plots. Fluorescence emission spectra and fluorescence intensities were measured for KpnI MTase on a Shimadzu, RF 5000 spectrofluorimeter using a 1-cm stirred quartz cuvette at 37 °C. The emission spectra were recorded over a wavelength of 300–400 nm with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. KpnI MTase was allowed to equilibrate for 2 min in methylation buffer before measurements were made. Small aliquots of cofactor (final concentration 1 μm–100 μm) were added to KpnI MTase (5 μm), and spectra were recorded. The binding of AdoMet to KpnI MTase resulted in quenching of fluorescence. Each spectra recorded was an average of three scans. The fluorescence intensities were plotted against the total AdoMet concentration, and the data were analyzed according to Stern-Volmer and the modified Stern-Volmer equation (32Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 17: 3254-3263Google Scholar). The Stern-Volmer relationship is represented by,F0/F=1+KSV[Q]Equation 1 where F 0 and F are fluorescent intensities in the absence and presence of cofactor respectively,K SV is the collision Stern-Volmer constant, and Q is the quencher (AdoMet) concentration. In the case where there is a heterogeneous population of fluorophores, the modified Stern-Volmer relationship is used,F0/(F0−F)=1/{[Q]×fa×K0}+1/faEquation 2 where fa is the fractional number of fluorophores accessible to the quencher, and K Q is the quenching constant. The dissociation constants were calculated graphically using the modified Stern-Volmer plot (a plot ofF 0/(F 0 − F)versus 1/[Q]), where K Q = 1/K d (33Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 259Google Scholar, 34Samworth C.M. DegliEsposti M. Lenaz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 81-86Google Scholar). KpnI MTase (1 μm) was preincubated with [3H]AdoMet (4 μm) at 37 °C for 5 min. The preincubated reaction mix was brought to a final volume of 150 μl with methylation buffer containing 4 μm[methyl-3H]AdoMet and 600 nm DNA. Aliquots of 20 μl each were removed at 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-s time intervals, and the reaction was stopped by snap-chilling the samples in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then analyzed for radiolabeled product formation using a DE81 filter binding assay. In a parallel reaction, the above-mentioned preincubated mix was brought to 150 μl with methylation buffer containing 4 μm unlabeled AdoMet and 600 nm DNA, and the reaction was carried out as described earlier. The binding kinetics of purified KpnI MTase with DNA was determined by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy using the BIACORE 2000 optical biosensor (Amersham Biosciences). The 24-mer (duplex XI) with one KpnI recognition sequence containing a 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated chip (Amersham Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. KpnI MTase titration (concentration range, 75–150 nm) was performed in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P-20. The surface was regenerated by passing 5 μl of 0.05% SDS followed by 10 μl of 1m NaCl for further binding reactions. The binding data was analyzed using BIA evaluation software (version 3.1). One of the four surfaces was used as a negative control for the interaction. Unless otherwise indicated, all enzyme activity data are the average of at least triplicate determinations. Data points were collected in duplicate, plotted as Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots, and fit to weighted linear regressions. The Michaelis-Menten equation was used for all studies described here. The following equations were used. Hyperbola, v=Vmax[S]Km+[S]Equation 3 Ordered mechanism,E+A↔k−1k1EA+B↔k−2k2EAB→kcatE+P+QEquation 4 v=Vmax[A][B]KiaKb+Kb[A]+Ka[B]+[A]Equation 5 K ia is the dissociation constant for the EA complex, K a is the Michaelis constant for A, andK b is the Michaelis constant for B. Other mechanisms were eliminated by demonstrating unacceptable fits of the data to the appropriate equations.Competitive inhibition, v=Vmax[S]Km(1+I/Ki)+[S]Equation 6 Noncompetitve inhibition, v−Vmax[S]Km+[S](1+I/Ki)Equation 7 The parameters are as follows: v, initial velocity;V max, maximum velocity; K m, Michaelis constant; K i, inhibition constant. In the present work, we sought to obtain kinetic insights into events underlying the interaction of enzyme with substrates and their relationship to catalysis. KpnI MTase was purified to homogeneity and purity of the protein judged as being greater than 99% on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enzyme preparations used for the kinetic analysis showed an optimal activity at a pH 8.0 and 37 °C in the presence of 100 mm KCl. No product inhibition was observed under initial velocity conditions. Thermal stability experiments showed thatKpnI MTase was completely inactive when incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence of substrates. Gel filtration analysis was performed to determine size and subunit structure of KpnI MTase in solution. Superdex 200 column was calibrated with proteins of known size (12–150 kDa), and different concentrations ofKpnI MTase were loaded (11.1–222.2 μm).KpnI MTase eluted as a symmetric peak at a position corresponding to a globular protein of ∼90 kDa (Fig.2), suggesting that the enzyme exists as a dimer under native conditions. Glutaraldehyde is a homobifunctional cross-linking reagent that cross-links N-terminal primary amines of lysine residues, resulting in the formation of amidine cross-links between protein subunits.KpnI MTase contains 36 lysine residues/molecule. Chemical cross-linking of KpnI MTase with glutaraldehyde was carried out to determine the oligomeric nature of the enzyme. Glutaraldehyde-treated KpnI MTase migrated with a relative molecular mass of 90 kDa (Fig. 3). It was observed that increasing the concentration of glutaraldehyde in the cross-linking reaction mixture resulted in an increase in the cross-linked KpnI MTase. These results demonstrate thatKpnI MTase exists as a dimer in solution. Based on the amino acid sequence, the molecular mass of KpnI MTase was calculated to be ∼47 kDa. The molecular mass of purified protein determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was ∼45 kDa. However, size-exclusion chromatography analysis (Fig. 2) and chemical cross-linking by glutaraldehyde (Fig. 3) showed thatKpnI MTase exists as a dimer in solution in the concentration range of 11.1–222.2 μm. Most of the characterized MTases such as HhaI MTase (10Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Google Scholar),EcoRI MTase (29Rubin R.A. Modrich P. J. Biol.

However, MTases such as CcrM MTase (36Shier V.K. Hancey C.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14744-14751Google Scholar), adenine MTases from DpnII R-M systems (37de la Campa A.G. Kale P.

Biol. 1999; 293: 1055-1065Google Scholar) exist as dimers in solution. RsrI MTase (41Kaszubska W. Webb H.K. Gumport R.I. Gene. 1992; 118: 5-11Google Scholar) and MspI MTase have been shown to dimerize at high protein concentrations (42Dubey A.K. Mollet B. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1579-1585Google Scholar). To establish the relationship between the initial velocity of the reaction and enzyme concentration, the rate of DNA methylation catalyzed at different KpnI MTase concentrations was determined. The substrate used for this analysis was pUC18 plasmid DNA with a singleKpnI (GGTACC) site. Varying concentrations (0.1–1 μm final concentration) of KpnI MTase was added to the reaction mixture containing DNA and AdoMet and incubated at 37 °C. The progress of methylation was monitored by withdrawal of 20-μl samples at timed intervals. All time courses displayed a rapid burst in product formation followed by a slower rate of product formation at various KpnI MTase concentrations (Fig.4 A). This is consistent with an initial burst in product formation followed by a rate-limiting step after methyl transfer. These curves were further used to calculate the initial velocity (v o=d[P]/dt) of each reaction catalyzed by a givenKpnI MTase concentration. When initial velocities were plotted against the corresponding enzyme concentration a nonlinear plot was obtained (Fig. 4 B). This indicated that, at low concentrations of KpnI MTase, the initial velocity of the reaction is not directly proportional to the enzyme concentration, suggesting that KpnI MTase-catalyzed reaction is higher than first order with respect to enzyme concentration. The nonlinear relationship of enzyme concentration on rate of DNA methylation strongly suggests cooperative binding of two molecules ofKpnI MTase to DNA. Furthermore, replotting the initial velocity of the reaction against the square of KpnI MTase concentration yielded a linear plot (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that the cooperative binding of two molecules ofKpnI MTase is required to methylate DNA. Similar experiments were carried out using both unmethylated (duplex IX) and hemimethylated oligonucleotides (duplex X)"
https://openalex.org/W1987084499,"Abstract The protein phosphatase 2A holoenzyme is composed of one catalytic C subunit, one regulatory/scaffolding A subunit, and one regulatory subunit. The core enzyme consists of A and C subunits only. The A and C subunits both exist as two closely related isoforms, α and β. The subunits belong to four weakly related or unrelated families, designated B′, B, and B‴, with multiple members in each family. The existence of two A and two C subunit isoforms permits the formation of four core enzymes, AαCα, AαCβ, AβCα, and AβCβ, and each core enzyme could in theory give rise to multiple holoenzymes. Differences between Cα and Cβ in expression and subcellular localization during early embryonic development have been reported, which imply that Cα and Cβ have different functions. To address the question of whether these differences might be caused by enzymatic differences between Cα and Cβ, we purified six holoenzymes composed of AαCα or AαCβ core enzyme and subunits from the B′, or B families. In addition, we purified four holoenzymes composed of AβCα or AβCβ and B′α1 or B/PR72. The phosphatase activity of each purified form was assayed using myelin basic protein and histone H1 as substrates. We found that Cα and Cβ have identical phosphatase activities when associated with the same A and subunits. Furthermore, no difference was found between Cα and Cβ in binding A or subunits. These data suggest that the distinct functions of Cα and Cβ are not based on differences in enzymatic activity or subunit interaction. The implications for the relationship between the structure and function of Cα and Cβ are discussed."

Furie B.C. Cell. 1998; 53: 505-518Google Scholar,2Kalafatis M. Swords N.A. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 113-129Google Scholar). This interaction is mediated through contact of the γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)1 domains of these proteins with membranes containing acidic phospholipids (3Nelsestuen G.L. Shah A.M. Harvey S.B. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 355-389Google Scholar, 4Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8007-8013Google Scholar). The Gla domain consists of ∼40 N-terminal residues of which 9–12 glutamic acid residues are post-translationally modified to Gla (5Magnusson S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Peterson T.E. Morris H.R. Dell A. FEBS Lett. 1974; 44: 189-193Google Scholar, 6Nelsestuen G.L. Zytokovicz T.H. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6347-6350Google Scholar, 7Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5527-5535Google Scholar). In the presence of calcium, the Gla domain adopts structure and binds to membranes by a mechanism that is not fully understood. The Gla domains of the different vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins show striking sequence homology, yet have quite different affinities for phospholipid membranes (8McDonald J.F. Shah A.M. Schwalbe R.A. Kisiel W. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5120-5127Google Scholar). If the Gla domain constitutes the membrane contact region, individual amino acid residues within this domain should contribute to these different affinities. This suggestion has been supported by mutations of the Gla domain that affect membrane affinity. For example, the P10H mutant of bovine protein C shows an ∼10-fold enhancement in membrane affinity, whereas the H10P mutant of human protein C shows an ∼3-fold decline in membrane affinity (9Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16025-16031Google Scholar). Although a major difference among the vitamin K-dependent proteins is a Gla residue versusanother amino acid at position 32, the Q32E mutation of protein C has no impact on membrane affinity (10Zhang L. Jhingan A. Castellino F.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 942-952Google Scholar, 11Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31086-31091Google Scholar). Similarly, replacement of Glu32 in factor X has little impact on protein function (12Larson P.J. Camire R.M. Wong D. Fasano N.C. Monroe D.M. Tracy P. High K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5029-5038Google Scholar), and Glu32 of human prothrombin was described as only moderately important (13Ratcliffe J.V. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24339-24345Google Scholar), having little impact on eitherK m or V max of the prothrombinase reaction. However, a double mutant of human protein C, S11G/Q32E, shows an ∼10-fold enhancement in membrane affinity (11Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31086-31091Google Scholar), and a double mutant of factor VII, P10Q/K32E, has a 25-fold enhancement in membrane affinity (14Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Google Scholar). Under appropriate conditions, these proteins show similar improvement in function (11Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31086-31091Google Scholar, 14Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Google Scholar, 15Nelsestuen G.L. Stone M.

Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 98-103Google Scholar). Although previous studies showed that proteins with enhanced membrane affinity can be created, the contribution of individual amino acid residues was not determined, and possible improvement by changes in other sites was not shown. This study used human factor VII (FVII) as a model Gla domain to investigate these questions and presents a simple functional assay that allows evaluation of minute quantities of impure protein as an initial screen of mutant protein activity. Single-site mutants as well as those with the highest affinity were purified and characterized. The results indicate that nearly all functional improvements arose from membrane binding affinity. The largest enhancements in membrane affinity resulted from mutation in the region of residue 32, a position that is located quite far from the N-terminal end of the protein, where membrane contact is generally suggested (39Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16227-16236Google Scholar). The mutant with highest function, (Y4)P10Q/K32E/D33F/A34E, showed 150–296-fold improvement over wild-type FVII. Overall, the proteins described in this study contribute to a better understanding of the membrane contact site and the binding forces involved while providing novel reagents to probe coagulation reaction mechanisms that may be of use in therapy. Cloning and mutagenesis were performed by ATG Inc. (Eden Prairie, MN) following standard procedures (17Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1991: 8.5.7-8.5.9Google Scholar). Human FVII cDNA was cloned from a human liver cDNA library and then subcloned into the vector pRc-CMV. Mutagenesis was verified by sequencing of the entire Gla domain of all variant FVII proteins, including untranslated pre- and propeptide segments. Proteins were expressed in fetal human kidney 293 cells that were stably transfected using the agent LipofectAMINETM2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Following previously outlined procedures (9Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16025-16031Google Scholar), Geneticin-resistant colonies were selected, and high producing clones were grown to confluence in three layered flasks (Nunc) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.0 mmnonessential amino acids, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml vitamin K1, and 100–200 μg/ml Geneticin. Confluent cells were rinsed with and then cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.0 mm nonessential amino acids, 10 μg/ml vitamin K1, and 0.5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride. EDTA (pH 7.4) and benzamidine hydrochloride were added to conditioned medium intended for purification to concentrations of 5.0 and 2.0 mm, respectively. The conditioned medium was vacuum-filtered twice through Whatman double-filter paper (qualitative No. 1) and then through a 0.22-μm polyether sulfone membrane (Corning Inc.). If not immediately purified, the filtered medium was stored at −70 °C. The filtered medium was diluted 1:1 with distilled and deionized water containing 4.0 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and 2.0 mmbenzamidine hydrochloride and then applied to a High Q Macro-Prep anion-exchange column (Bio-Rad). The column was equilibrated prior to loading and washed extensively with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.02% (w/w) NaN3 (pH 7.4)) containing 2.0 mm EDTA and 2.0 mm benzamidine hydrochloride. The column was eluted isocratically with the same buffer containing 400 mm NaCl and no EDTA. Eluted fractions containing FVII activity were pooled and diluted 1:1 with Tris buffer containing 30 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm benzamidine hydrochloride. The pooled and diluted fractions were subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography using a calcium-dependent anti-human FVII monoclonal antibody (CaFVII22, provided by Dr. Walter Kisiel) coupled to Affi-Prep®Hz support (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with Tris buffer containing calcium and then eluted with Tris buffer containing 15 mm EDTA and 2.0 mm benzamidine hydrochloride. Fractions containing FVII activity were pooled and subjected to a final ion-exchange chromatography step using a Mono Q HR5/5 anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated and washed extensively with Tris buffer. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 100–500 mm NaCl over 30 min (flow rate of 1.0 ml/min). Eluted protein was concentrated by centrifugation filtration (Millipore Ultrafree,M r 10,000 cutoff) and then stored at −70 °C. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the proteins were highly pure and contained only zymogen FVII and FVIIa in both nonreducing and reducing gels. The percentage of FVIIa ranged from 40 to 95%. Prior to assay for enzyme activity, the proteins were fully activated using a commercial source of tissue factor (TF; Innovin, Dade Behring Corp.). A commercial preparation of FVIIa (NovoSeven, Nordisk) was used as the standard for all measurements. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The amidolytic activity for the chromogenic substrate S-2288 (Chromogenix) was also used as a standard of comparison. Plasma clotting assays, described previously (15Nelsestuen G.L. Stone M. Martinez M.B. Harvey S.B. Foster D. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39825-39831Google Scholar), were used to determine FVIIa concentration. To ensure that FVIIa was the limiting component, the assay was conducted in the presence of excess TF (Innovin). TF concentrations in the Innovin preparation were determined from the concentration of NovoSeven needed to generate maximum activity. The TF concentration in the preparation used in this study was 2.7 nm. FVII was activated by mixing either crude or purified protein with 20 μl of Innovin solution, followed by incubation at 37 °C until activation was complete. (Typically, 1.0 μl of solution resulted in a final concentration of ∼0.3 nm FVII.) Activation of FVII was monitored by adding 2.65 μl of the activation mixture to 112.5 μl of prewarmed standard Tris buffer (0.05 m) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6.67 mmCaCl2. To initiate coagulation, 37.5 μl of prewarmed FVII-deficient plasma (Sigma) was added, and clotting time was determined by the hand tilt-test method. Full activation occurred within 1 h, and concentrations of FVIIa were determined by comparison with the NovoSeven standard. The results for the different assay comparisons gave the same protein concentration within the estimated error of the assays (±20%). Active site-blocked wild-type FVIIa (WT-FVIIai) was produced as previously described (15Nelsestuen G.L. Stone M. Martinez M.B. Harvey S.B. Foster D. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39825-39831Google Scholar) using the active-site inhibitor dansyl-glutamylglycylarginyl chloromethyl ketone (Dr. Walter Kisiel) and NovoSeven as the source of WT-FVIIa. WT-FVIIai concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Highly pure phospholipids in organic solvent (bovine brain phosphatidylserine (PS) and egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), Sigma) were mixed at proper ratios and thoroughly dried, first under a stream of argon gas and then under vacuum for 14 h. Dried phospholipids were solubilized in Tris buffer and sonicated on ice for 3-s bursts every 10 s for 3 min (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics W-385). This was repeated four times. The sonicated vesicles were applied to a Sepharose 4B size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences). Eluted fractions containing vesicles with average diameters of 32–38 nm (LSA2 photon correlation spectrometer, Langley Ford Co.) were pooled for use in membrane binding studies. The concentrations of phospholipid were determined by phosphorus analysis (18Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Google Scholar) using a phospholipid/phosphorus weight ratio of 25:1. Protein-membrane binding was determined by relative light scattering at 90° using methods previously described (19Nelsestuen G.L. Lim T.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4164-4170Google Scholar). Briefly, for a constant particle concentration and for particles that are small compared with the wavelength of light, the ratio of the light scattering intensity of a protein·vesicle complex (I 2) to that of the vesicles alone (I 1) is related to the ratio of the molecular weight of the protein·vesicle complex (M 2) to that of the vesicles alone (M 1) by the relationship in Equation 1, I2/I1=(M2/M1)2(∂n/∂c)3)2Equation 1 where ∂n/∂c is the change in refractive index as a function of concentration of the light scattering species and was estimated as described (19Nelsestuen G.L. Lim T.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4164-4170Google Scholar). Light scattering contributions of the buffer and protein were subtracted to obtainI 1 and I 2. Values ofM 2/M 1 were estimated at various amounts of added protein and were plotted versus the protein (P)/phospholipid (PL) ratio (w/w). Dissociation constants (K D) for protein-membrane binding were estimated from the relationship in Equation 2.KD=[P]free[P⋅PLmax−P⋅PL]/[P⋅PL]Equation 2 The amount of free protein ([P]free) was estimated from the known weight concentrations of phospholipid and protein in the solution and the difference betweenM 2/M 1 and the theoretical value of M 2/M 1 if all of the added protein were bound. Weight concentrations of bound and free FVII were converted to molar concentration with a M rof 50,000 for all FVII variants. The concentration of P·PL was estimated from the known concentration of phospholipid and the ratioM 2/M 1. P·PLmax was calculated by assuming saturation binding at a ratio of 1:1 protein/phospholipid in the complex (M 2/M 1(max) = 2.0) (19Nelsestuen G.L. Lim T.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4164-4170Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to confirm the identity of the variant FVII proteins tested and to assess the extent of carboxylation. Purified proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of either chymotrypsin or trypsin at a ratio of 500:1 (w/w) FVII protein/protease. Reaction solutions were dried by vacuum centrifugation and solubilized in a 5:95 acetonitrile/water solution containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The solutions were desalted using reverse-phase chromatography (ZipTip, Millipore Corp.), mixed 1:1 with a saturated matrix solution (5-methoxysalicylic acid in 50:50 ethanol/water solution), spotted on the spectrometer target, allowed to dry, and then subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (BiflexTM III, Bruker). Minimum laser power was used to obtain spectra. Moderate increases in power above this minimum did not result in changes in the distribution of the various carboxylated species observed. The percentage of each carboxylation species was determined by measurement of peak areas using integration software provide by the spectrometer manufacturer. The relative activities of FVIIa variants were determined by a method outlined previously (15Nelsestuen G.L. Stone M. Martinez M.B. Harvey S.B. Foster D. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39825-39831Google Scholar). Full activation of FVII was first ensured by incubation with TF (18 pm; Innovin) in 50 μl of Tris buffer containing 5.0 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The mutant FVII proteins with higher membrane affinity (K32E, P10Q/K32E, P10Q/D33E, and (Y4)P10Q/K32E/D33F/A34E) were added to a final protein concentration of 3.0 nm. WT-FVIIa, P10Q, and K32E were added to a final concentration of 10 nm. Full activation of the FVIIa preparation was achieved after incubation for 1 h. A range of WT-FVIIai concentrations was added, and the mixture was allowed to equilibrate for another 2 h at 37 °C. Factor X (Enzyme Research Laboratories) was added to a concentration of 200 nm to initiate the reaction. After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of excess EDTA (15 mm). The concentration of factor Xa was measured as activity for chromogenic substrate (0.32 mm S-2222, Chromogenix) by monitoring the absorbance change at 405 nm in a Beckman DU-70 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The amount of FVIIa that was bound to tissue factor (FVIIa·TF) was estimated from the activity observed relative to that of a standard with no WT-FVIIai. The concentration of WT-FVIIai bound to TF (WT-FVIIai·TF) was estimated from the fraction activity that was lost. Results are presented in a Hill-type plot represented by Equation 3 (15Nelsestuen G.L. Stone M. Martinez M.B. Harvey S.B. Foster D. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39825-39831Google Scholar), log([WT-FVIIai⋅TF]/[FVIIa⋅TF]) =log([WT-FVIIai]/[FVIIa])+log KD(VIIa)/KD(VIIai)Equation 3 where K D(VIIai) is the dissociation constant for the WT-FVIIai·TF complex andK D(VIIa) is the dissociation constant for the FVIIa·TF complex. Comparison of a plot of log([WT-FVIIai·TF]/[FVIIa·TF]) versuslog[WT-FVIIai] for two FVIIa variants at an identical and constant FVIIa concentration will allow estimation of their relative affinities for TF. Equation 3 represents free protein concentrations. Therefore, conditions were selected to ensure that the total protein concentration was in large excess over TF, so total protein was approximately equal to free protein. Pure FVII preparations or conditioned medium containing FVII were added to Innovin (0.1 ml) in an amount to generate ∼0.3 nm FVII. This concentration of pure FVII provided a final coagulation time of 25 s for all samples. Because all FVII variants have the same clotting time in the absence of inhibitor (see pure protein analysis below and Ref. 15Nelsestuen G.L. Stone M. Martinez M.B. Harvey S.B. Foster D. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39825-39831Google Scholar), use of a constant clotting time allowed the determination of the FVII concentration in an unpurified sample. It was important that TF was maintained in excess over FVII. Activation of FVII was allowed to proceed to completion (60 min at 37 °C). Activated FVII solution (containing 2.5 μl of Innovin) plus varying amounts of WT-FVIIai were mixed with Tris buffer containing 6.67 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to create 112.5-μl aliquots, which were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to achieve equilibrium binding between TF, WT-FVIIai, and FVIIa. Coagulation was initiated by addition of 37.5 μl of prewarmed FVII-deficient plasma. Clotting times (CT) were determined, and results were evaluated by a plot of log(CT/CTo)versus log[WT-FVIIai], where CTo is the clotting time without inhibitor. Relative function of the different FVIIa variants was estimated by offset of the plots for the two proteins. The identities of purified recombinant FVII proteins were verified by mass spectrometry of Gla domains released from the intact proteins by limited protease digestion. The Gla domains consisted of either 1–40 (containing all Gla residues) or 1–32 (less one carboxylation site at residue 35) N-terminal residues. Use of the methoxysalicylic acid matrix and the lowest practical laser power resulted in a low level of undercarboxylated peptide species (Fig.1). In most cases, the fully carboxylated peptide (theoretical m/z of 5235 for the +1 charge state of K32E) was the most abundant peak (Fig. 1 A). However, in-source decarboxylation of Gla residues occurred during MALDI-TOF analysis and reached quantitative levels when the sinapinic acid matrix was used (20Martinez M.B. Harvey S.B. Higgins L. Krick T. Shen T. Kisiel W. Foster D. Brown T. Evans Jr., T.C. Shah A.M. Nelsestuen G.L. Proceedings of the 49th Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, Chicago, May 27–31, 2001. American Society for Mass Spectrometry, Santa Fe, NM2001Google Scholar). Undercarboxylation was detected by peaks separated by 44 mass units and a small peak corresponding to the fully decarboxylated peptide (m/z 4751) (Fig. 1 A). The quantitative distribution among the different species was very consistent for replicate samples as well as for many plasma-derived versusrecombinant proteins (20Martinez M.B. Harvey S.B. Higgins L. Krick T. Shen T. Kisiel W. Foster D. Brown T. Evans Jr., T.C. Shah A.M. Nelsestuen G.L. Proceedings of the 49th Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, Chicago, May 27–31, 2001. American Society for Mass Spectrometry, Santa Fe, NM2001Google Scholar). This consistency suggested that comparison of quantitative MALDI-TOF data could be used to detect relative differences in the carboxylation states of various proteins. For example, repeated measurement of different preparations of plasma-derived bovine factor X gave 77 ± 4% signal intensity in the fully carboxylated peptide. This level of fully carboxylated peptide corresponded to 97–98% carboxylation of all Glu residues. Similar results were obtained for bovine prothrombin and human protein C. Consequently, the somewhat lower yield of the fully carboxylated peptide of recombinant WT-FVII (46%) suggested undercarboxylation of the parent protein (Fig. 1 B). In fact, undercarboxylation at position 35 of recombinant WT-FVIIa has been previously observed (21Jurlander B. Thim L. Klausen N.K. Persson E. Kjalke M. Rexen P. Jorgensen T.B. Ostergaard P.B. Erhardtsen E. Bjorn S.E. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2001; 27: 373-383Google Scholar,22Thim L. Bjoern S. Christensen M. Nicolaisen E.M. Lund-Hansen T. Pedersen A.H. Hedner U. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7785-7793Google Scholar). That position 35 of recombinant WT-FVII was the major site of undercarboxylation was also suggested by MALDI-TOF analysis of peptide 1–32, which gave a high yield of the fully carboxylated state (70%) (Fig. 1 B). Undercarboxylation at position 35 of FVII (and a corresponding residue in factor IX (23Gillis S. Furie B.C. Furie B. Patel H. Huberty M.C. Switzer M. Foster B.W. Scoble H.A. Bond M.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 185-196Google Scholar)) had no detected impact on the activity of the mature proteins (21Jurlander B. Thim L. Klausen N.K. Persson E. Kjalke M. Rexen P. Jorgensen T.B.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7785-7793Google Scholar). The total carboxylation levels of WT-FVII and P10Q/K32E, determined by this procedure, were 9.3 (of 10 theoretical) and 10.4 (of 11 theoretical) residues per Gla domain, respectively. These estimates were nearly identical to the values of 9.6 ± 0.9 and 10.7 ± 0.8 obtained by amino acid analysis after base hydrolysis (14Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Google Scholar). Comparative analysis by MALDI-TOF was used to estimate the carboxylation states for the FVII mutants produced in this study. Five of the seven proteins showed >93% of theoretical Gla levels (Fig.1 B, last column), suggesting a carboxylation state of the parent protein similar to that of commercial FVIIa. Two mutants showed substantially lower levels of carboxylation, 8.9 of 11 theoretical residues for P10Q/D33E and 10.9 of 12 theoretical residues for (Y4)P10Q/K32E/D33F/A34E. The latter mutants contained additional Glu residues beyond position 32. Given that undercarboxylation occurs at position 35 of recombinant WT-FVIIa, it was possible that the additional Glu residues at positions 33 and 34 were undercarboxylated as well. If correct, the functional impact of Gla residues at positions 33 and 34, detected in the following studies, may underestimate the true impact of Gla at these positions. When small unilamellar vesicles of 25:75 PS/PC were used to measure protein binding, the variant proteins displayed increasing membrane affinity in the order WT-FVII < P10Q < K32E (Fig.2 A). Mutants with higher affinity (K32E) bound at the theoretical limit (Fig. 2 A), so equilibrium binding constants could not be estimated. Because binding affinity is dependent on PS content of the membrane, use of a lower PS content (10:90 PS/PC) (Fig. 2 B) provided an equilibrium of bound and free protein for most mutants. Affinity increased in the order WT-FVII < P10Q < K32E < P10Q/D33E < P10Q/K32E. Dissociation constants estimated from these results are reported in Table I. TheK D value obtained for P10Q/K32E (0.16 ± 0.08 μm) compared well with the value of 0.22 μmfor small unilamellar vesicles of 10:90 PS/PC reported by Shah et al. (14Shah A.M. Kisiel W. Foster D.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4229-4234Google Scholar). Even lower PS content was needed to estimate the binding constant for the highest affinity mutant (5:95 PS/PC) (Fig.2 C). Estimated K D values indicated a 3-fold enhancement in membrane affinity for the (Y4)P10Q/K32E/D33F/A34E mutant over the P10Q/K32E variant.Table IImpact of mutagenesis on FVII activity and membrane affinityFactor X activation (relative function)aWT-FVIIai concentration at 50% inhibition of 10 nm (lightface) and 3.0 nm (boldface) factor VIIa.

We have extended these findings to show that APLP2 and E3/19K associate preferentially with folded Kd and not with the open form. APLP2 was detectable at the cell surface, but its surface expression was not up-regulated by the concurrent expression of Kd. Experimental down-regulation of APLP2 expression caused a consistent increase in the surface expression of Kd, indicating that APLP2 normally reduces Kd surface expression.

These peptides must be bound by cell surface class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1 heavy chains. Assembly of the MHC class I heavy chain, a light chain called β2-microglobulin (β2m), and peptide into the heterotrimeric, complete MHC class I molecule occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (2Pamer E.

Although many aspects of chaperone assistance with the folding of class I molecules have been elucidated, the rules governing chaperone selection have not been fully defined. It has been shown that the products of certain class I alleles may interact disparately with different chaperones. Natural HLA molecules with limited amino acid changes in the α2 domain differ in respect to whether they associate with TAP (12Neisig A. Wubbolts R. Zang X. Melief C. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3196-3206PubMed Google Scholar). Certain HLA-A and -B subtypes strongly associate with TAP, tapasin, and calreticulin, while others differing only at a single amino acid residue show little to no association with these same proteins (13Turnquist H.R.

Furthermore, the HLA subtypes that lack association with these ER proteins are more poorly retained and are present in greater quantity at the cell surface, indicating that differences in the ability of natural MHC heavy chains to interact with these ER proteins are functionally relevant (13Turnquist H.R.

Amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) is a type I transmembrane protein and a member of the amyloid precursor protein family that is implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease; however, APLP2 lacks the β-amyloid peptide domain (Αβ) that is deposited as extracellular amyloid in the brain parenchyma of Alzheimer's disease patients (16Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10804-10809PubMed Google Scholar, 17Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyeuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar). Although APLP2 is ubiquitously expressed, its function is unknown. In the ER, APLP2 associates with the murine class I MHC molecule Kd and with some HLA molecules (18Sester M. Feuerbach D. Frank R. Preckel T. Guterman A. Burgert H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3645-3654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). APLP2/Kd interaction has been demonstrated in FO-1Kdβ (human melanoma cell line), B7 (H-2dmurine fibroblast cell line), and 293-Kd (human embryonic kidney cell line) (18Sester M. Feuerbach D. Frank R. Preckel T. Guterman A. Burgert H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3645-3654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Experimental retention of Kd with brefeldin A, which induces retrograde Golgi → ER transport, increases the number of Kd molecules associated with APLP2 (18Sester M. Feuerbach D. Frank R. Preckel T. Guterman A. Burgert H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3645-3654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). APLP2 can be dissociated from Kd by the addition of a Kd-specific peptide ligand (19Feuerbach D. Burgert H.-G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); therefore, APLP2 may play a role in the assembly of Kd and possibly other MHC class I molecules as well. In this study, we examined the role of APLP2 as a possible chaperone of the Kd molecule, utilizing an epitope-tagged Kd(etKd) heavy chain that can be specifically detected in the open as well as the folded form (20Yu Y.Y.L. Myers N.B. Hilbert C.H. Harris M.R. Balendiran G.K. Hansen T.H. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that APLP2 binds only to the folded form of MHC class I, which is also preferentially bound by the adenovirus protein E3/19K. This specificity for the folded form differentiates APLP2 and E3/19K from other proteins known to bind to MHC class I heavy chains. When intracellular expression of APLP2 was experimentally down-regulated, the surface expression of Kd rose, indicating that APLP2 not only associates with Kd but also regulates its expression at the cell surface. HeLa cells and DAP-3 L cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin.

All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Τhe mAb 64-3-7 is an IgG2 Ab that recognizes a short stretch of amino acids in the α1 domain of open, peptide-free Ld (27Smith J.D. Myers N.B. Gorka J.

SF1.1.1 mAb recognizes both open and folded forms of Kd as it is directed toward the α3 region of the molecule (30Cox J.H. Bennick J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Exp.

Arnold B. Sanderson A.R. Ferrier P. Lemonnier F.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2190-2196PubMed Google Scholar). HC10 is an IgG2a mAb that reacts preferentially with open HLA-B and -C heavy chains (33Stam N.J. Spits H. Ploegh H.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2299-2306PubMed Google Scholar, 34Carreno B.M. Hansen T.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Generation of the polyclonal rabbit antisera AP 206 and AP tail has been described previously (18Sester M. Feuerbach D. Frank R. Preckel T. Guterman A. Burgert H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3645-3654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbits were immunized with peptides representing amino acids 206–219 of APLP2 (for AP 206) or corresponding to the C terminus of APLP2 (for AP tail). AP 206 recognizes human APLP2, while AP tail cross-reacts with both human and murine APLP2. Although the AP 206 serum is specific for APLP2, the AP tail serum also binds to amyloid precursor protein at a very low level (18Sester M. Feuerbach D. Frank R. Preckel T. Guterman A. Burgert H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3645-3654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since the AP tail serum reacted much better with APLP2 than did AP 206 and because co-precipitation of endogenous amyloid precursor protein using the AP tail serum was at a negligible level, the AP tail serum was used for some experiments. The etKd cDNA was generated by site-directed mutagenesis at position 48 (arginine → glutamine) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA) as described previously (20Yu Y.Y.L. Myers N.B. Hilbert C.H. Harris M.R. Balendiran G.K. Hansen T.H. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This substitution confers the epitope for the 64-3-7 mAb. The etKd has been thoroughly tested for proper assembly, folding, and trafficking and shown to function equivalently to wild type Kd (20Yu Y.Y.L. Myers N.B. Hilbert C.H. Harris M.R. Balendiran G.K. Hansen T.H. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The etKd was cloned into the mammalian expression vector RSV.5-neo and stably transfected into HeLa and DAP-3 L cells with Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Cells were selected in culture with 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin. Levels of surface expression of the etKdproteins were determined by indirect immunofluorescence with mAb as described below. For transient transfections, 293 and 293.12 cells (1 × 106 each) were plated into 60-mm plates and transfected with etKd using a calcium phosphate transfection system (Invitrogen) or Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The adenoviral vectors used had deletions of the E1 and E3 regions of the adenovirus, and a dual expression cassette was inserted in place of the E1 region (35Bruder J.T. Jie T. McVey D.L. Kovesdi I. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7623-7628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression cassette carries E3/19K driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter with or without the reporter gene β-glucuronidase driven from the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. β-Glucuronidase expression allows the assessment of infection efficiency by immunohistochemistry. The null control vector has the E3/19K sequence deleted. For infections, untransfected HeLa cells and HeLa-etKd cells (1 × 107 of each) were plated and infected 24 h later in 3 ml of serum-free medium at a multiplicity of infection of 20 for 2 h at 37 °C. The virus was then washed off the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and medium with serum was added. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were washed two times with PBS. Radiolabeling and immunoprecipitations were then carried out as described below. Cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in methionine-free culture medium. For each immunoprecipitation, 1 × 107 cells were used. The cells that were compared within each experiment were of matched, high viability and of matched confluence. Next [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) was added, and the cells were radiolabeled for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times in PBS containing iodoacetamide (Sigma) and lysed in 1% CHAPS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 1% digitonin in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with freshly added 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 20 mmiodoacetamide.l-1-Chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-7-amino-2-heptanone hydrochloride (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was also added to the digitonin lysis buffer. The lysis buffer was supplemented with a saturating volume of mAb before its addition to pelleted cells. After incubation for 1 h on ice, nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and lysates were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times with ice-cold 0.1% CHAPS or 0.1% digitonin in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and protein was eluted from the beads by boiling in 0.125 mTris (pH 6.8), 0.2% SDS, 12% glycerol, 2% bromphenol blue. All immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on 4–20% Tris-glycine acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). In instances where comparisons were made, all samples were electrophoresed on the same gel. For autoradiographs, gels were soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) plus 2% glycerol, dried, and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For Western blotting, immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE as described above and were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking overnight at 4 °C in 10% (w/v) dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, membranes were incubated in a dilution of Ab for 2 h, washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, and incubated for 1 h with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Caltag Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). Following three washes with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, membranes were incubated for 1 h with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), washed three times with 0.3% Tween 20 in PBS, and incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot developing reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were exposed to Biomax MR film for various periods of time. RNA was prepared from 4 × 106 DAP-3 L cell fibroblasts by the Qiagen RNeasy minikit. The reverse transcription-PCR was performed with the Gene-Amp kit (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ) using primers designed with APLP2-specific sequences (5′-ACCAATGATGTTGATGTGTATTTT-3′ and 5′-TAAGGAACTTTGTACAGAAGAGA-3′). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended at 5 × 106/ml in PBS containing FACS medium (0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide). Cell suspension aliquots (0.1 ml) were added to a 96-well plate. The cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of antibody or FACS medium alone for 30 min at 4 °C, washed two times, and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated, Fc-specific, affinity-purified F(ab′)2 fragment of donkey anti-rabbit IgG (if AP 206 had been used as the primary Ab) or goat anti-mouse IgG (if 34-1-2 had been used as the primary Ab) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed two times, resuspended, and analyzed on a FACS-Calibur flow cytometer (BD Immunocytometry Systems) at the University of Nebraska Medical Center Cell Analysis Facility. RNA interference treatments were performed using an established technique (36Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T.

(Lafayette, CO) in the annealed and purified form. The APLP2 siRNA sense sequence used was 5′-GTTCTTCAGTACTGTCAGGdTdT-3′. This sequence corresponds to an APLP2 sequence that follows an AA plus it has two dT residues added to the 3′-end of the RNA. The APLP2 inverse siRNA sense sequence used was 5′-GGACTGTCATGACTTCTTGdTdT-3′. In the design of the siRNA, a National Center for Biotechnology Information data base BLAST search was performed to ensure that the siRNA would target only APLP2. For each duplex, 20 nmol of purified, annealed duplex in annealing buffer was received from Dharmacon Research, Inc. to which we added 1 ml of RNase-free water (also supplied by Dharmacon Research, Inc.) to make a 20 μm stock solution. The day prior to transfection, HeLa-etKd cells were plated in six-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well in 3 ml of antibiotic-free medium per well. After overnight incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were transfected as follows. For each well, 12 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and 3 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) were combined in a polystyrene tube, mixed gently without vortexing, and incubated for exactly 5 min at room temperature. In separate tubes, the siRNA or inverse siRNA was diluted as follows. For each well of a six-well plate, 175 μl of Opti-MEM was mixed with 10 μl of duplexed 20 μm siRNA, inverse duplexed 20 μm siRNA, or water. For each well, diluted Oligofectamine solution (15-μl total volume) was combined with diluted siRNA solution (185-μl total volume) in a polystyrene tube, mixed gently by pipetting, and incubated 15 min at room temperature. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. We examined whether APLP2 associates with etKdin two cell types: HeLa-etKd (human cervical carcinoma cells) and DAP-3-etKd (murine L cell fibroblasts). etKd was immunoprecipitated from radiolabeled cell lysates with SF1.1.1 mAb, which recognizes total Kd. Fig.1 shows etKd and APLP2 association in HeLa-etKd was easily detectable by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. In contrast, interaction between APLP2 and etKd in DAP-3-etKd was relatively weak (Fig. 1), although it could be detected in prolonged film exposures. The level of expression of APLP2 is not low in DAP-3 as we could readily detect it by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). These observations suggest that the strength of APLP2 and Kd association may be cell-dependent. To determine at what point in the process of etKd assembly the association between etKd and APLP2 first occurs, we used the 64-3-7 mAb, which allows immunoprecipitation specifically of the open form of etKd. etKd was immunoprecipitated from HeLa-etKdlysates with mAb SF1.1.1 (for total etKd), 34-1-2 (for folded etKd), or 64-3-7 (for open etKd). The immunoprecipitates were probed on a Western blot with anti-APLP2 serum for co-precipitated APLP2. Both open and folded forms of etKd were present in the cell lysates (Fig.2); however, no association was found between APLP2 and open Kd. Thus APLP2 recognizes a conformational binding site in the α1/α2 region. Two bands, migrating closely to each other, are visible in the 64-3-7 lane in Fig. 2. The identity of the upper band in the doublet is not known for certain. It may be a differentially glycosylated form of etKd, or it may be tapasin, which has a molecular weight slightly larger than that of the MHC class I heavy chain and which associates with open MHC class I heavy chains, including 64-3-7+ etKd (8Sadasivan B.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 5656-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two bands have previously been distinguished in autoradiographs of 64-3-7 immunoprecipitates of Ld and etKd (7Carreno B.M. Solheim J.C. Harris M. Stroynowski I. Connolly J.M. Hansen T.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4726-4733PubMed Google Scholar, 38Myers N.B. Harris M.R. Connolly J.M. Lybarger L. Yu Y.Y. Hansen T.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5656-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly the higher molecular weight band is not visible in the SF1.1.1 lane in Fig. 2, although SF1.1.1 recognizes unfolded as well as folded etKd. It has been previously observed that TAP (and therefore also possibly tapasin) does not co-precipitate with 28-14-8+ Ld (7Carreno B.M. Solheim J.C. Harris M. Stroynowski I. Connolly J.M. Hansen T.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4726-4733PubMed Google Scholar). The 28-14-8 antibody, like SF1.1.1, is an anti-α3 domain antibody that recognizes both open and folded forms. Anti-α3 domain antibodies may be unable to co-precipitate TAP and tapasin with open forms of MHC class I due to steric hindrance, consistent with the finding that the α3 domain of class I is involved in TAP and tapasin association (7Carreno B.M. Solheim J.C. Harris M. Stroynowski I. Connolly J.M. Hansen T.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4726-4733PubMed Google Scholar,39Kulig K. Nandi D. Bacik I. Monaco J.J. Vukmanovic S. J. Exp.

By flow cytometry, we investigated whether any complete APLP2 molecules could be detected at the surface of HeLa and HeLa-etKd cells. The AP 206 anti-serum can immunoprecipitate APLP2 even after glycosaminoglycan modification (18Sester M. Feuerbach D. Frank R. Preckel T. Guterman A. Burgert H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3645-3654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 43Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

HeLa-etKd cells and HeLa cells were incubated with the anti-APLP2 antiserum AP 206 or with FACS medium alone. Following incubation with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. APLP2 was detected at equivalent levels on HeLa and HeLa-etKd (Fig.3). Thus, despite the strong intracellular association between APLP2 and etKd, the expression of etKd does not affect the level of APLP2 at the cell surface. The adenoviral protein E3/19K is known to bind to class I molecules and retain them in the ER through an ER retrieval sequence in its cytoplasmic tail (21Burgert H.-G. Kvist S. Cell. 1985; 41: 987-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 44Andersson M. Paabo S. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A.

E3/19K also binds independently to TAP and thereby prevents tapasin from bridging TAP to class I (46Bennett E.M. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Brodsky F.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5049-5052PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the association of APLP2 with etKd increased when HeLa-etKd cells expressed E3/19K (Fig. 4), consistent with a similar observation by Sester et al. (18Sester M. Feuerbach D. Frank R. Preckel T. Guterman A. Burgert H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3645-3654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since the binding of APLP2 to etKd was limited to the folded form of etKd (Fig. 2), we tested whether binding of E3/19K was similarly restricted. For this experiment, 293-E3/19K (293.12) cells were transiently transfected with etKd, radiolabeled, and lysed. The cell lysates were incubated with 34-1-2 to immunoprecipitate folded Kd and 64-3-7 to immunoprecipitate open Kd. E3/19K associated preferentially with the folded (34-1-2+) form of etKd and not the open (64-3-7+) form (Fig. 5). Thus E3/19K seems to interact preferentially with the folded form of class I as does APLP2. To determine whether interaction between APLP2 and etKd has functional consequences, we down-regulated the expression of APLP2 in HeLa-etKd with siRNA corresponding to an APLP2 sequence. As controls, mock treatment or treatment with an inverse of the correct APLP2 siRNA sequence was performed. APLP2-specific siRNA, but not mock or inverse siRNA, significantly down-regulated APLP2 intracellular expression by 3 and 4 days post-treatment (Fig.6). The down-regulation in APLP2 expression was accompanied by a relative increase in cell surface etKd expression (Fig. 7 and Table I). Similar results were obtained with 34-1-2 and with SF1.1.1 in three separate experiments. APLP2 seems to retain etKd and depress its surface expression, supporting a possible role for APLP2 in regulating the trafficking of Kdout of the ER. Thus APLP2, a secreted protein, may regulate ER/Golgi export of Kd.Figure 7Down-regulation of APLP2 expression results in an up-regulation of MHC class I surface expression. A histogram is shown from flow cytometric analysis of HeLa-etKd cells with anti-Kd mAb 34-1-2 at 4 days after transfection of cells with APLP2-specific siRNA or inverse siRNA. As the secondary antibody, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated, Fc-specific, purified F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG was used. The y axis indicates relative cell counts, and the x axis indicates the relative mean fluorescence obtained with 34-1-2 and phycoerythrin. The dark line corresponds to cells treated with siRNA to reduce APLP2 expression (mean fluorescence value, 208.8). The light linecorresponds to cells treated with inverse siRNA (mean fluorescence value, 148.4).

Mean fluorescence obtained with no primary antibody or anti-Kd antibodies 34-1-2 and SF1.1.1 is shown. Considering our results with APLP2-specific siRNA (Fig. 7 and TableI), since APLP2 interacts with etKd more strongly in HeLa-etKd than in DAP-3-etKd (Fig. 1) it can be questioned whether there are indications of possible functional effects of this difference. We compared the level of etKd at the surface of the two cell types by flow cytometry and found that HeLa-etKdconsistently expressed a lower level of etKd at the surface than did DAP-3-etKd (data not shown) despite the matched level of intracellular etKd (shown by the immunoprecipitations in Fig. 1). HeLa-etKd and DAP-3-etKd could presumably have other cell- or species-specific differences that might influence etKdsurface expression in addition to the disparity in APLP2/etKd interaction. However, our finding that etKd expression is lower on HeLa-etKd than on DAP-3-etKd is certainly consistent with our findings using siRNA to down-regulate APLP2 expression in HeLa-etKd (Fig.7 and Table I). In both cases, reduction of APLP2 association with etKd correlated with increase in the quantity of cell surface etKd. Our results showed that APLP2 interacted with etKd in HeLa-etKd cells more strongly than in the L cell line DAP-3-etKd (Fig. 1). Our findings suggest that a cell-specific factor might be involved in the interaction between Kd and APLP2. Another possibility is that the difference is related to the presence of human versus murine β2m in these two cell types since β2m is a requirement for APLP2/Kd interaction (18Sester M. Feuerbach D. Frank R. Preckel T. Guterman A. Burgert H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3645-3654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since APLP2 binds to folded and not to open etKd, it interacts with etKd relatively late in maturation. Interestingly previous studies showed that addition of peptide caused dissociation of APLP2 from Kd (19Feuerbach D. Burgert H.-G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore APLP2 presumably binds to a form of Kd that is serologically recognized as folded but still is peptide-free. The specificity of APLP2 can be compared with that of other proteins that bind to MHC class I heavy chains in the ER. Calnexin binds to open as well as folded forms of Ld and does not release from Ldupon peptide addition to cell lysates (7Carreno B.M. Solheim J.C. Harris M. Stroynowski I. Connolly J.M. Hansen T.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4726-4733PubMed Google Scholar). TAP, tapasin, calreticulin, and ERp57 interact specifically with the open, peptide-free form of class I (5Ortmann B. Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Nature. 1994; 368: 864-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 6Suh W.-K. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Fruh K. Wang K. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B.

Thus the specificity of APLP2 is distinct from that of other proteins recognized as MHC class I chaperones. A new model for Kd assembly that incorporates APLP2 would include interaction of Kd with calnexin, association of the peptide-free heavy chain with tapasin, calreticulin, ERp57, and TAP, and then release of these proteins and interaction with APLP2 prior to peptide binding and migration to the cell surface. Since it has been shown that Kd interacts with glycosaminoglycan-modified APLP2, which is created in the Golgi (18Sester M. Feuerbach D. Frank R. Preckel T. Guterman A. Burgert H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3645-3654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), then Kd·APLP2 complexes presumably exist beyond the ER. Interestingly the exit of MHC class I molecules from the ER has recently been shown to be regulated at a point subsequent to TAP binding (47Spiliotis E.T. Osorio M. Zúñiga M.C. Edidin M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that some APLP2 molecules are present even at the surface of HeLa and HeLa-etKd cells (Fig. 3). Our results show that the presence of the adenoviral protein E3/19K results in increased association of APLP2 with etKd. The E3/19K protein, like APLP2, seems to bind preferentially to the folded form of Kd (Fig. 5), indicating that it also has specificity for a conformational determinant. Similarly, when we immunoprecipitated folded forms of the endogenous HLA class I molecules present in 293-E3/19K cells with mAb W6/32, E3/19K was co-precipitated; in contrast, HC10 immunoprecipitates of open HLA class I molecules did not contain associated E3/19K (data not shown). Viruses are known to use numerous mechanisms to evade recognition by the immune system, and it is possible that the adenovirus recruits APLP2 for its benefit. Our finding that APLP2 reduces the level of cell surface etKd is consistent with this notion. Adenovirus E3/19K down-regulates class I expression by direct retention of class I (21Burgert H.-G. Kvist S. Cell. 1985; 41: 987-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 44Andersson M. Paabo S. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A.

Immunol. 1987; 138: 3960-3966PubMed Google Scholar) and by binding to TAP (46Bennett E.M. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Brodsky F.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5049-5052PubMed Google Scholar). By retaining APLP2 in the ER, E3/19K may be acting to reduce Kd expression further. This would be a third mechanism whereby this single adenoviral protein down-regulates the surface expression of the MHC class I molecule. Although APLP2 binds well to Kd, it does not bind to all MHC class I molecules (18Sester M. Feuerbach D. Frank R. Preckel T. Guterman A. Burgert H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3645-3654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Feuerbach D. Burgert H.-G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This attribute is not unique to APLP2 since MHC class I allele specificity is also exhibited by TAP, tapasin, and calreticulin (12Neisig A. Wubbolts R. Zang X. Melief C. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3196-3206PubMed Google Scholar, 13Turnquist H.R. Thomas H.J. Prilliman K.R. Lutz C.T. Hildebrand W.H. Solheim J.C. Eur. J.

Disparity among class I molecules in regard to chaperone dependence may provide protection against attack from viruses against any particular chaperone. In this case, if adenovirus is indeed using APLP2 to increase the down-regulation of Kd, the inability of APLP2 to interact with all class I molecules limits the extent to which APLP2 can be exploited by the virus.

This sequence has been defined in more detail by peptide library screening: two different phosphoserine motifs, R[S/Ar][+/Ar]Sp[L/E/A/M]P and RX[S/Ar][+]Sp[L/E/A/M]P (where Ar indicates an aromatic residue and + a basic residue), defined as mode-1 and mode-2 sequences respectively, were proposed (9Yaffe M.B.

However these motifs cannot account for all 14-3-3 interactions and, even though phosphorylation seems to be a general prerequisite for 14-3-3 binding, proteins interacting in a phosphorylation-independent manner have also been identified (10Du X.

Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Google Scholar, 14Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Google Scholar). In the concave surface, each monomer presents an amphipathic groove formed by a cluster of basic residues (Lys49, Arg56, Lys120, Arg127) on one side, and hydrophobic residues (Val176, Leu216, Leu220, Leu227) on the other side. Crystallization studies of 14-3-3ζ with phosphorylated peptides reproducing mode-1 consensus sequence demonstrated that phosphoserine interacts by salt bridges with the side chains of basic residues of the 14-3-3 groove (9Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Google Scholar, 15Petosa C. Masters S.C. Bankston L.A. Pohl J. Wang B. Fu H. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16305-16310Google Scholar). Accordingly, mutations of Lys49, Arg56, and Arg60 hamper the association of 14-3-3ζ with Raf-1 and exoenzyme S (16Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Google Scholar). Substitution of residues in the hydrophobic cluster also affects binding properties (17Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Google Scholar). In plants, much less information about the mechanism of interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and their targets is available. Most of the binding sequences so far identified are ascribable to the mode-1 motif (2Finnie C. Borch J. Collinge D.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 545-554Google Scholar, 7Sehnke P.C. DeLille J.M. Ferl R.J. Plant Cell. 2002; : S339-S340Google Scholar). A remarkable exception is represented by the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. In fact, it contains, at the extreme end of its C-terminal domain, the 14-3-3 binding site YTV (18Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Google Scholar), which is totally unrelated to those previously identified. Phosphorylation of the threonine residue in the YTV sequence, which has been demonstrated to occur in vivo (19Svennelid F. Olsson A. Piotrowski M. Rosenquist M. Ottman C. Larsson C. Oecking C. Sommarin M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2379-2391Google Scholar), is required for the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (18Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Google Scholar, 20Camoni L. Iori V. Marra M. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9919-9923Google Scholar). Association of 14-3-3 proteins with the H+-ATPase is stabilized by the toxin fusicoccin (FC)1, known to strongly activate the H+-ATPase (21Aducci P. Marra M. Fogliano V. Fullone M.R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 1463-1478Google Scholar). Moreover, FC is able to trigger the interaction of 14-3-3 with the H+-ATPase also in the absence of phosphorylation (22Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Google Scholar). Here we report on mutational studies carried out to elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and the plasma membrane H+-ATPase of plant cells. Different mutants of the maize 14-3-3 GF14-6 isoform (K56E, K56Q, K56R, and V185E) were produced and used in interaction studies with the plasma membrane H+-ATPase and with a peptide reproducing the 14-3-3 binding site of the enzyme. The ability of 14-3-3 mutants to stimulate the phosphohydrolytic activity of the H+-ATPase was also tested and correlated to the interaction data. Finally, to investigate the mechanism of the FC-dependent interaction, binding experiments between 14-3-3 proteins and mutants of the extreme portion of the H+-ATPase C terminus were carried out. FC was prepared according to Ballio et al. (23Ballio A. Carilli A. Santurbano B. Tuttobello L. Ann. First Super. Sanità. 1968; 4: 317-332Google Scholar); tritiated dihydroFC ([3H]FC) with specific activity 0.77 TBq/mmol was obtained according to Ballio et al. (24Ballio A. Federico R. Pessi A. Scalorbi D. Plant Sci. Lett. 1980; 18: 39-44Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 110 TBq/mmol) and thrombin were from Amersham Biosciences (Upssala, Sweden). Protein kinase A, catalytic subunit, was from Sigma. bL15Vp peptide biotynil-LKGLDIDTIQQNYTpV (Tp, phosphothreonine) and MHA2–776p peptide biotynil-ALIFVTRSRSpWSFVE (Sp, phosphoserine) were synthesized by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Chemicals for gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, California, USA). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Maize seeds (Zea mays L. cv. Santos) from Dekalb (Mestre, Italy) were germinated and grown in the dark for 6 days, as already described (25Marra M. Fogliano V. Zambardi A. Fullone M.R. Nasta D. Aducci P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 293-296Google Scholar). E. colistrains were grown at 37 °C in LB liquid medium or agar plates (15 g/l). Ampicillin was used at concentration of 100 μg/ml. Strain DH5α was used for plasmid propagation and strain BL21(DE3) was used for protein expression. pGEX-2TK carrying the GF14-6 cDNA (pX18 DNA clone) was used as a template for mutagenesis of GF14-6 14-3-3 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of Lys56 was obtained by PCR amplification of the 108–787 fragment using a 5′ oligonucleotide primer containing the desired mutations and SacI restriction site and a 3′ oligonucleotide primer containing EcoRI restriction site complementary to the 3′ end of GF14-6 cDNA. PCR product was directly cloned in pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and, after sequencing, the mutated SacI-EcoRI fragment was recovered and subcloned in SacI-EcoRI cut pX18. Mutagenic primers used were (mutations generated are underlined and restriction sites are in lowercase): Lys56 → Glu, 5′-gagctcACTGTGGAGGAGCGAAACCTCTTGTCTGTTGCATACGAGAAC-3′; Lys56 → Gln, 5′-gagctcACTGTGGAGGAGCGAAACCTCTTGTCTGTTGCATAC CAGAAC-3′; Lys56 → Arg, 5′-gagctcACTGTGGAGGAGCGAAAC CTCTTGTCTGTTGCATACAGGAAC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-gaattcCTTACTGCCCCTCGCTCGAGTCCCGCTTG-3′. Site-directed mutagenesis of Val185 was performed by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic primers used were (mutation generated is underlined): coding primer 5′-TTAACTTCTCAGAGTTCTACTATGAGATTCTG-3′; complementary primer 5′-CATAGTAGAACTCTGAGAAGTTAAGTGCCA-3′. After 18 cycles of PCR (30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 53 °C, 11 min 40 s at 68 °C), 10 units of DpnI were added to the mixture to digest the pX18 DNA template, and reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h. 20 μl of the mixture were used to transform E. coli DH5α competent cells. Incorporation of mutation was controlled by DNA sequencing. pGEX-2T carrying the cDNA fragment encoding the last 103 amino acid residues of the H+-ATPase MHA2 isoform (Maize H +-ATPase isoform2) (pGEX-E DNA clone) (22Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Google Scholar) was used as a template. Mutagenesis was obtained by PCR using mutagenic oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 3′ end of the cDNA fragment, containing the desired mutations and EcoRI restriction site, and a primer based on the 5′ end of the cDNA fragment corresponding to 2738–2752 region of the MHA2 gene (26Frias I. Caldeira M.T. Pérez-Castiñeira J.R. Navarro-Aviño J.P. Culiañez-Maciá F.A. Kuppinger O. Stransky H. Pagés M. Hager A. Serrano R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1533-1544Google Scholar) containing BamHI restriction site. Mutagenic primers were (mutations generated are underlined and restriction sites are in lowercase): Glu938 → Ala, 5′-gaattcTCACACCGTGTAGTTCTGCTGGATGGTGTCGA-TGGCCAG-3′; Glu940 → Ala, 5′-gaattcTCACACCGTGTAGTTCTGCTGGATGGTGGCGATGTCCAG-3′; Glu938 and Glu940 → Ala, 5′-gaattcTCACACCGTGTAGTTCTGCTGGATGGTGGCGATGGCCAG-3′; Thr947 → Glu, 5′-gaattcTCACACCTCGTAGTTCTGCTGG-3′; 5′ primer, 5′-GCGggattcAGCGGCAGG GCATGG-3′. Wild-type and mutated GF14-6 proteins were expressed inE. coli as fusion proteins with the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) using pGEX-2TK vector, whereas wild-type and mutant C-terminal domain of MHA2 H+-ATPase were expressed as GST-fusion proteins using pGEX-2T vector, following the procedure described by Fullone et al. (22Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Google Scholar). Two-phase partitioned plasma membranes from maize roots were obtained as previously described (25Marra M. Fogliano V. Zambardi A. Fullone M.R. Nasta D. Aducci P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 293-296Google Scholar). Plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA1 isoform (Arabidopsis thaliana H +-ATPase isoform1) was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as previously described (27Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666Google Scholar). After cell homogenization, membranes were purified by differential centrifugation and ER, containing most of the AHA1, was isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation (28Marra M. Olivari C. Visconti S. Albumi C. Aducci P. De Michelis M.I. Plant Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Google Scholar), in a Mini Protean apparatus (Bio-Rad). The system used for expression of wild-type and mutated GF14-6 proteins produces a GST-fused 14-3-3 containing a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site and a thrombin site between the two polypeptides. The 32P-labeled wild-type and mutated GF14-6 were obtained as described (22Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Google Scholar). Specific activities of all the labeled proteins were similar (about 3 MBq/mg). The overlay assay was carried out according to Fullone et al. (22Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, two-phase partitioned maize plasma membranes (10 μg protein) containing the H+-ATPase, wild-type and mutated GST-C-terminal domain of the MHA2 (1 μg) or wild-type and mutated GF14-6 proteins (0.5 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, using a semidry LKB apparatus (2 h, 0.8 mA cm−2). The membrane was blocked with 5% fatty acid-free milk in 25 mmHepes-OH, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5 (buffer H) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer containing 2% fatty acid-free milk, 3 μg of32P-labeled wild-type or mutated GF14-6 proteins (corresponding to 9 kBq/ml) and, where indicated, 10 μmFC. After incubation, the membrane was washed three times with buffer H, dried, and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. Each overlay experiment was performed at least three times, and similar results were obtained. 0.5 nmol of bL15Vp or MHA2–776p peptides were immobilized onto 40 μl of streptavidin-agarose resin (Sigma) and incubated in 50 μl of buffer H along with 3 μg of 32P-labeled wild-type or mutated GF14-6 (1.4 kBq/μg) for 60 min at room temperature in the absence or in the presence of 10 μm FC. Resin was then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min and washed three times with 1 ml of buffer H containing, where indicated, 10 μm FC. Resin-bound radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation β counter (LKB Wallac 1410). bL15Vp and MHA2–776p peptides were immobilized onto the streptavidin-agarose resin, in the conditions already described, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 10 μg of wild-type or mutated GST-GF14-6 proteins in the presence of 30 nm[3H]FC, in 100 μl of buffer H. After three washes with 1 ml of buffer H, resin was added to 10 ml of scintillation liquid and radioactivity was measured in the β counter (LKB Wallac 1410). Specific binding was calculated subtracting to the total [3H]FC-binding the value measured in the presence of 10 μm FC. AHA1 phosphohydrolitic activity of yeast ER membranes was assayed according to Marra et al. (28Marra M. Olivari C. Visconti S. Albumi C. Aducci P. De Michelis M.I. Plant Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Google Scholar) with minor modifications: 10 μg of sucrose gradient purified yeast ER were preincubated with different concentrations of wild-type or GF14-6 mutants (ranging from 0 to 1 μm) in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-Mes, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KNO3, 5 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm ammonium molybdate and 10 μm FC, pH 7.2 (buffer A). After 20 min incubation, 2 mm ATP was added. ATP hydrolysis was measured according to Serrano (30Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 157: 533-544Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. In the 14-3-3ζ isoform, mutations of Lys49 and Val176 have been reported to drastically reduce the interaction with the prototype consensus motif of Raf-1 (16Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Google Scholar, 17Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Google Scholar). To verify whether the association between plant 14-3-3 proteins and the peculiar YTpV binding sequence of the H+-ATPase shares the same mechanism, we generated the corresponding mutations of the maize 14-3-3 isoform GF14-6. In Fig.1 the alignment of 14-3-3ζ and GF14-6 isoforms shows that Lys49 and Val176 residues in 14-3-3ζ correspond to Lys56 and Val185, respectively, in GF14-6. K56E and V185E mutants were expressed inE. coli as GST-fusion proteins. The overall structure integrity of mutant proteins was examined by circular dichroism analysis and by testing their ability to dimerize. CD spectra of mutants overlapped that of wild-type protein (data not shown). To check the dimerization properties of mutants, overlay assay experiments were carried out. In this system, 32P-labeled GF14-6 wild-type, K56E, and V185E proteins were used as probes and the same unlabeled proteins, immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane, as baits. Autoradiography, reported in Fig. 2, shows that both 32P-labeled mutated proteins were able to interact each other and with the wild-type, demonstrating that the ability of mutants to form dimers was unaffected.Figure 2Dimerization properties of GF14-6 mutants. Overlay assay was carried out with wild-type and mutant proteins treated with thrombin to remove GST. 0.5 μg of K56E, V185E, and wild-type GF14-6 were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and, after blotting, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with 32P-labeled wild-type GF14-6 (a), 32P-labeled K56E mutant (b) or 32P-labeled V185E mutant (c), in the conditions indicated under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of K56E and V185E mutations on the association of 14-3-3 proteins with the H+-ATPase was investigated by means of the overlay assay. 32P-labeled K56E, V185E, and wild-type GF14-6 proteins were used as probes and the H+-ATPase from maize roots as a bait. The results of autoradiography are reported in Fig.3 a. K56E (2Finnie C. Borch J. Collinge D.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 545-554Google Scholar) and V185E (3Roberts M.R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 400-405Google Scholar) mutations severely hampered the association of 14-3-3 protein with the H+-ATPase. Binding of mutants, compared with wild-type, is reduced also in the presence of FC (Fig. 3 a), which is known to strongly increase association of 14-3-3 with the H+-ATPase (22Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Google Scholar). It is known that 14-3-3 proteins can interact with the H+-ATPase also in a phosphorylation-independent manner. In these conditions, the association is completely dependent on FC (18Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Google Scholar,20Camoni L. Iori V. Marra M. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9919-9923Google Scholar, 22Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Google Scholar). To verify whether K56E and V185E mutations affect also this interaction, the ability of mutated proteins to bind the recombinant C-terminal domain of H+-ATPase, expressed in E. coli as a GST-fusion protein, was tested. As shown in Fig.3 b, for both mutants, the interaction with the C-terminal domain of the H+-ATPase was almost completely abolished. The relevance of the contribution of Lys56 to the H+-ATPase binding was further studied by mutating it in Gln and Arg and expressing the mutated GST-fusion proteins in E. coli. The effect of mutations on the interaction was tested by overlay experiments. As reported in Fig.4 a, substitution of Lys56 with the polar residue Gln only partially restored the binding activity (3Roberts M.R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 400-405Google Scholar). On the other hand, the interaction with the H+-ATPase was completely rescued by the conservative mutation K56R (4Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that the positive charge is also required in the FC-dependent interaction; in fact, K56Q mutant showed a very weak interaction with both H+-ATPase (Fig. 4 a) and its C-terminal domain (Fig. 4 b). A phosphorylated biotinyl-peptide (bL15Vp) reproducing the last 15 amino acid residues of the MHA2 H+-ATPase and containing the 14-3-3-YTpV binding sequence was used in interaction studies with GF14-6 mutants. The peptide was immobilized onto a streptavidin-agarose resin and incubated with32P-labeled wild-type and mutant proteins. Interestingly, the results, reported in Fig. 5, were only partially in accordance with those obtained by overlay assays. In fact, although, as expected, K56E and V185E mutants did not interact with bL15Vp peptide and K56Q interacted very weakly, the conservative mutant K56R bound bL15Vp more efficiently than the wild-type GF14-6 did. The same binding experiments were carried out with a phosphorylated peptide (MHA2–776p) reproducing a putative 14-3-3-binding site located in the cytosolic stretch between the 8 and 9 helices of the MHA2 H+-ATPase. This peptide contains the mode-1 related sequence RSRSpWS, and it has been reported to interact with GF14-6 protein (28Marra M. Olivari C. Visconti S. Albumi C. Aducci P. De Michelis M.I. Plant Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Google Scholar); however, the physiological relevance of this interaction has not yet been demonstrated. The results were substantially in accordance with those obtained with bL15Vp peptide. Yet a remarkable difference was observed when the experiments were performed in the presence of FC; in fact, whereas FC strongly stabilized the bL15Vp/14-3-3 complexes, it was completely ineffective on the MHA2–776p/14-3-3 interaction (Fig. 5). These data were confirmed by assaying the ability of peptides/14-3-3 complexes to bind a tritiated derivative of FC. In fact, as reported in Fig.6, only the complexes between bL15Vp peptide and wild-type GF14-6, or K56R mutant, were able to bind [3H]FC. The effect of Lys56 and Val185 mutations on the in vitro activation of the H+-ATPase induced by 14-3-3 proteins was tested by using purified ER vesicles of S. cerevisiae expressing the H+-ATPase AHA1 isoform ofArabidopsis thaliana. In this system, a significant and reproducible stimulation of H+-ATPase can be obtained by exogenous 14-3-3 proteins, provided that FC is also added. ER membranes were incubated with different amounts of wild-type or mutated GF14-6 proteins in the presence of 10 μm FC. The results, reported in Fig. 7, demonstrate that the ability to stimulate the H+-ATPase activity depends on the ability to associate with it. In fact, only the wild-type and K56R GF14-6, which efficiently bound H+-ATPase in the interaction experiments (Fig. 4), stimulated AHA1 phosphohydrolytic activity. R18 is a synthetic peptide selected from a phage display library for its ability to bind 14-3-3 proteins in a phosphorylation-independent manner (32Wang B. Yang H. Liu Y. Jelinek T. Zhang L. Rouslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Google Scholar). It has been proposed that binding property is due to the motif WLDLE. Interestingly, in the H+-ATPase C terminus a very similar sequence, namely 936GLDID (numbered according to MHA2 isoform), located close to the C-terminal end is present. To verify whether this sequence could be involved in the phosphorylation-independent, FC-dependent interaction, single and double mutation of the two acidic residues, Asp938 and Asp940, were obtained. The wild-type and mutated C-terminal domains were expressed in E. coli as GST-fusion proteins and assayed for their ability to interact with 32P-labeled GF14-6 in overlay experiments, in the presence of 10 μm FC. As shown in Fig. 8 A, mutation D940A (lane 3) did not affect the binding of recombinant H+-ATPase C terminus, mutation D938A (lane 2) reduced the binding, and double mutation (lane 4) completely abolished it. These results demonstrated the relevance of the two negatively charged residues for the FC-dependent interaction with GF14-6. A further indication of the importance of negative charges in the FC-dependent interaction was obtained by means of the T947E mutant. It contains a negatively charged residue in place of the phosphorylatable threonine residue, within the YTV 14-3-3 binding sequence. This mutant had been produced to verify whether the negative charge of the glutamic acid could mimic the phosphate group. Autoradiography reported in Fig. 8 B showed that no interaction occurred between GF14-6 and the mutated C terminus. Surprisingly, however, in the presence of FC, the T947E mutant (lane 2) interacted more efficiently than did the wild-type C-terminal domain. The plasma membrane H+-ATPase of plant cell is regulated by 14-3-3 proteins. It contains the 14-3-3 binding motif YTV, located at the extreme end of the C-terminal autoinhibitory region of the enzyme. This is a novel sequence completely unrelated to the well characterized mode-1 and mode-2 motifs, which accounts for most of 14-3-3 interactions with target proteins. Hence, we were interested in identifying residues important for binding activity of a plant 14-3-3 protein and ascertaining whether the interaction with the H+-ATPase underlies the same mechanism reported for the interaction with canonical motifs (9Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Google Scholar, 15Petosa C. Masters S.C. Bankston L.A. Pohl J. Wang B. Fu H. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16305-16310Google Scholar). To this purpose, single amino acid mutations known to affect the binding properties of animal 14-3-3 proteins were reproduced in the plant 14-3-3 isoform GF14-6, and their effects on the ability to interact with and to activate the H+-ATPase were investigated. In this study, we show that K56E and V185E mutations drastically hamper the interaction of GF14-6 with the H+-ATPase. These results indicate that Lys56 and Val185 are both crucial for binding to the YTpV sequence, thereby suggesting that basic and hydrophobic clusters in the conserved amphipathic groove of 14-3-3 are involved also in this interaction. This finding is worth noting, because the H+-ATPase binding site lacks the main features of classical consensus sequences, namely a basic residue at the −3/−4 position as well as a proline at the +2 position. It has been suggested that the proline residue is important to fold the binding site, allowing the entrance of the C-terminal portion back toward to the binding groove (33Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Google Scholar); probably in the H+-ATPase the localization of the phosphoamino acid residue at the extreme C-terminal end of the protein renders the role of the proline residue unnecessary. Interestingly, the 14-3-3 binding sequence GHSL of the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex protein (34Andrews R.K. Harris S.J. McNally T. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 638-647Google Scholar), which also lacks the proline at +2 Sp position, is likewise located at the extreme C-terminal end of the protein. The importance of a positively charged residue at position 56 of GF14-6 has been further probed by substituting the Lys residue with a Gln or Arg residue. In comparison with the mutation K56E, the polar K56Q partially, and the conservative K56R completely, restored the binding activity. Interestingly, efficiencies of H+-ATPase stimulation by mutants directly paralleled binding affinities. The interaction mechanism with H+-ATPase was further investigated by studying the binding of wild-type and mutant GF14-6 to the bL15Vp peptide, reproducing the last 15 residues of MHA2 H+-ATPase and containing the YTpV sequence. The results were in good agreement with those observed with the whole enzyme in the overlay experiments. However, the K56R mutant, compared with the wild-type GF14-6, displays a much higher affinity toward the bL15Vp peptide than to the H+-ATPase. A possible explanation is that the bL15Vp peptide does not exactly match the conformational features occurring in the whole enzyme, which can be important in the physiological interaction of the enzyme. It is worth noting that no FC effect was detected when the interaction studies were performed with the MHA2–776p peptide, which reproduces a putative 14-3-3 binding site in the H+-ATPase (28Marra M. Olivari C. Visconti S. Albumi C. Aducci P. De Michelis M.I. Plant Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Google Scholar) related to a mode-1 binding motif. This strongly suggests that the ability to bind FC is a unique feature of the complex between 14-3-3 protein and the extreme portion of the C-terminal domain of the proton pump. FC strongly stabilizes the interaction between 14-3-3 and the H+-ATPase and brings about 14-3-3 binding also in the absence of enzyme phosphorylation. The results of the overlay assay with the recombinant unphosphorylated C-terminal domain of the H+-ATPase demonstrated that Lys56 and Val185 are both essential for FC-induced binding. This indicates that the same amphipathic 14-3-3 binding groove is involved also in the FC-dependent interaction, occurring in the absence of phosphorylation. This result appears particularly relevant because it has been observed that binding with unphosphorylated 14-3-3 targets does not required the same hydrophobic residues involved in the interaction with phosphorylated proteins (35Zhang L. Wang H. Masters S.C. Barbieri J.T. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12159-12164Google Scholar). It has been proposed (9Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Google Scholar) that the function of the basic cluster in 14-3-3 proteins is to interact with the negatively charges of the phosphoamino acid within the binding site; in this respect, the question is open about the effect of Lys56 mutation, which abolishes the binding also in the absence of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the H+-ATPase. An explanation for this result was obtained by studying the effect of point mutation of the H+-ATPase C terminus. In fact, substitution of the two Asp with Ala residues, within the sequence 936GLDID (numeration according to MHA2 isoform) located close to the YTV sequence, completely abolished the ability of recombinant C-terminal domain of H+-ATPase to bind GF14-6 in the presence of FC. This demonstrates that negative charges play a role also in the FC-dependent interaction, probably mimicking the phosphate group function in the 14-3-3/target complex formation. This hypothesis has also been proposed for the unphosphorylated R18 peptide, which contains the very similar sequence WLDLE; in fact, in the 14-3-3ζ/R18 complex, the two Asp and Glu acidic residues of peptide are located next to the basic cluster of the 14-3-3 protein (15Petosa C. Masters S.C. Bankston L.A. Pohl J. Wang B. Fu H. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16305-16310Google Scholar). Intriguingly exoenzyme S, which interacts with 14-3-3 proteins in a phosphorylation-independent manner, possesses a homologous motif,245FGADAE, in its C-terminal region (12Masters S.C. Pederson K.J. Zhang L. Barbieri J.Y. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5216-5221Google Scholar). The role of negative charges in the FC-dependent interaction can also be inferred from data obtained with the T947E mutant. In fact, the introduction of a further negatively charged residue brought about a marked increase in the ability to bind 14-3-3 protein. In conclusion, our data show that positively charged residues in GF14-6 binding groove and negatively charged residues in the C-terminal domain of H+-ATPase play a crucial role in binding between these proteins, even when, as in the FC-dependent interaction, it occurs in the absence of H+- ATPase phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2123253777,"Growth-blocking peptide (GBP) is a small (25 amino acids) insect cytokine with a variety of functions: controlling the larval development of lepidopteran insects, acting as a mitogen for various types of cultured cells, and stimulating insect blood cells. The aromatic residues of GBP (Phe-3, Tyr-11, and Phe-23) are highly conserved in the ENF peptide family found in lepidopteran insects. We investigated the relationship between the biological activities and structural properties of a series of GBP mutants, in which each of the three aromatic residues is replaced by a different residue. The results of the hemocytes-stimulating assays of GBP mutants indicated that Phe-3 is the key residue in this activity: Ala or Tyr replacement resulted in significant loss of the activity, but Leu replacement did not. The replacements of other aromatic residues hardly affected the activity. On the other hand, NMR analysis of the mutants suggested that Tyr-11 is a key residue for maintaining the core structure of GBP. Surprisingly, the Y11A mutant maintained its biological activity, although its native-like secondary structure was disordered. Detailed analyses of the 15N-labeled Y11A mutant by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy showed that the native-like β-sheet structure of Y11A was induced by the addition of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. The results suggest that Y11A has a tendency to form a native-like structure, and this property may give the Y11A mutant native-like activity."
