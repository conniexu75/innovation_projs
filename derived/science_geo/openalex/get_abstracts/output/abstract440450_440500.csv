https://openalex.org/W1985557598,"Yijun Ruan and colleagues report the draft genome of the sweet orange, Citrus sinensis. Their data suggests sweet orange originated from a cross between pummelo and mandarin. Oranges are an important nutritional source for human health and have immense economic value. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the draft genome of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis). The assembled sequence covers 87.3% of the estimated orange genome, which is relatively compact, as 20% is composed of repetitive elements. We predicted 29,445 protein-coding genes, half of which are in the heterozygous state. With additional sequencing of two more citrus species and comparative analyses of seven citrus genomes, we present evidence to suggest that sweet orange originated from a backcross hybrid between pummelo and mandarin. Focused analysis on genes involved in vitamin C metabolism showed that GalUR, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of the galacturonate pathway, is significantly upregulated in orange fruit, and the recent expansion of this gene family may provide a genomic basis. This draft genome represents a valuable resource for understanding and improving many important citrus traits in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1969836970,"Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is upregulated in multiple cancer types and contributes to the Warburg effect by unclear mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that EGFR-activated ERK2 binds directly to PKM2 Ile 429/Leu 431 through the ERK2 docking groove and phosphorylates PKM2 at Ser 37, but does not phosphorylate PKM1. Phosphorylated PKM2 Ser 37 recruits PIN1 for cis–trans isomerization of PKM2, which promotes PKM2 binding to importin α5 and translocating to the nucleus. Nuclear PKM2 acts as a coactivator of β-catenin to induce c-Myc expression, resulting in the upregulation of GLUT1, LDHA and, in a positive feedback loop, PTB-dependent PKM2 expression. Replacement of wild-type PKM2 with a nuclear translocation-deficient mutant (S37A) blocks the EGFR-promoted Warburg effect and brain tumour development in mice. In addition, levels of PKM2 Ser 37 phosphorylation correlate with EGFR and ERK1/2 activity in human glioblastoma specimens. Our findings highlight the importance of nuclear functions of PKM2 in the Warburg effect and tumorigenesis. Lu and colleagues delineate a pathway through which the PKM2 enzyme promotes aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, in cancer cells. They show that EGFR-activated ERK phosphorylates PKM2, leading to its accumulation in the nucleus. Nuclear PKM2 subsequently promotes the c-Myc-dependent upregulation of genes involved in the Warburg effect, resulting in tumour growth."

Comparative genome-wide analyses identify the extent of genetic diversity and population structure of watermelon germplasm. Watermelon, Citrullus lanatus, is an important cucurbit crop grown throughout the world. Here we report a high-quality draft genome sequence of the east Asia watermelon cultivar 97103 (2n = 2× = 22) containing 23,440 predicted protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics analysis provided an evolutionary scenario for the origin of the 11 watermelon chromosomes derived from a 7-chromosome paleohexaploid eudicot ancestor. Resequencing of 20 watermelon accessions representing three different C. lanatus subspecies produced numerous haplotypes and identified the extent of genetic diversity and population structure of watermelon germplasm. Genomic regions that were preferentially selected during domestication were identified. Many disease-resistance genes were also found to be lost during domestication. In addition, integrative genomic and transcriptomic analyses yielded important insights into aspects of phloem-based vascular signaling in common between watermelon and cucumber and identified genes crucial to valuable fruit-quality traits, including sugar accumulation and citrulline metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2000789682,"The conserved transcriptional regulator heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) is a key sensor of proteotoxic and other stress in the eukaryotic cytosol. We surveyed Hsf1 activity in a genome-wide loss-of-function library in Saccaromyces cerevisiae as well as ~78,000 double mutants and found Hsf1 activity to be modulated by highly diverse stresses. These included disruption of a ribosome-bound complex we named the Ribosome Quality Control Complex (RQC) comprising the Ltn1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, two highly conserved but poorly characterized proteins (Tae2 and Rqc1), and Cdc48 and its cofactors. Electron microscopy and biochemical analyses revealed that the RQC forms a stable complex with 60S ribosomal subunits containing stalled polypeptides and triggers their degradation. A negative feedback loop regulates the RQC, and Hsf1 senses an RQC-mediated translation-stress signal distinctly from other stresses. Our work reveals the range of stresses Hsf1 monitors and elucidates a conserved cotranslational protein quality control mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2144283689,"YAP has previously been identified as an oncogene that promotes cell growth, but now it is shown to restrict stem cell expansion during regeneration in the mouse intestine, suggesting that it may function as a tumour suppressor in colon cancer. YAP is the main transcriptional effector of the growth-suppressive Hippo signalling pathway. It has been identified as an oncogene that promotes cell growth, and has emerged as a potential antitumour target. Surprisingly, Fernando Camargo and colleagues now find that in the mouse intestine, YAP actually suppresses growth, acting to restrict stem cell expansion during regeneration by limiting Wnt signalling. Consequently, loss of YAP leads to hyperplasia and microadenomas during regeneration. YAP is found to be downregulated in some human colon cancer, and its expression can reduce the growth of human colorectal cancer xenografts, suggesting that it may function as a tumour suppressor in colon cancer. A remarkable feature of regenerative processes is their ability to halt proliferation once an organ’s structure has been restored. The Wnt signalling pathway is the major driving force for homeostatic self-renewal and regeneration in the mammalian intestine. However, the mechanisms that counterbalance Wnt-driven proliferation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate in mice and humans that yes-associated protein 1 (YAP; also known as YAP1)—a protein known for its powerful growth-inducing and oncogenic properties1,2—has an unexpected growth-suppressive function, restricting Wnt signals during intestinal regeneration. Transgenic expression of YAP reduces Wnt target gene expression and results in the rapid loss of intestinal crypts. In addition, loss of YAP results in Wnt hypersensitivity during regeneration, leading to hyperplasia, expansion of intestinal stem cells and niche cells, and formation of ectopic crypts and microadenomas. We find that cytoplasmic YAP restricts elevated Wnt signalling independently of the AXIN–APC–GSK-3β complex partly by limiting the activity of dishevelled (DVL). DVL signals in the nucleus of intestinal stem cells, and its forced expression leads to enhanced Wnt signalling in crypts. YAP dampens Wnt signals by restricting DVL nuclear translocation during regenerative growth. Finally, we provide evidence that YAP is silenced in a subset of highly aggressive and undifferentiated human colorectal carcinomas, and that its expression can restrict the growth of colorectal carcinoma xenografts. Collectively, our work describes a novel mechanistic paradigm for how proliferative signals are counterbalanced in regenerating tissues. Additionally, our findings have important implications for the targeting of YAP in human malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W4252911401,"Ca(2+) flux across the mitochondrial inner membrane regulates bioenergetics, cytoplasmic Ca(2+) signals and activation of cell death pathways. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake occurs at regions of close apposition with intracellular Ca(2+) release sites, driven by the inner membrane voltage generated by oxidative phosphorylation and mediated by a Ca(2+) selective ion channel (MiCa; ref. ) called the uniporter whose complete molecular identity remains unknown. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) was recently identified as the likely ion-conducting pore. In addition, MICU1 was identified as a mitochondrial regulator of uniporter-mediated Ca(2+) uptake in HeLa cells. Here we identified CCDC90A, hereafter referred to as MCUR1 (mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulator 1), an integral membrane protein required for MCU-dependent mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake. MCUR1 binds to MCU and regulates ruthenium-red-sensitive MCU-dependent Ca(2+) uptake. MCUR1 knockdown does not alter MCU localization, but abrogates Ca(2+) uptake by energized mitochondria in intact and permeabilized cells. Ablation of MCUR1 disrupts oxidative phosphorylation, lowers cellular ATP and activates AMP kinase-dependent pro-survival autophagy. Thus, MCUR1 is a critical component of a mitochondrial uniporter channel complex required for mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake and maintenance of normal cellular bioenergetics."
https://openalex.org/W2054997020,"Intelligent behavior requires acquiring and following rules. Rules define how our behavior should fit different situations. To understand its neural mechanisms, we simultaneously recorded from multiple electrodes in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) while monkeys switched between two rules (respond to color versus orientation). We found evidence that oscillatory synchronization of local field potentials (LFPs) formed neural ensembles representing the rules: there were rule-specific increases in synchrony at “beta” (19–40 Hz) frequencies between electrodes. In addition, individual PFC neurons synchronized to the LFP ensemble corresponding to the current rule (color versus orientation). Furthermore, the ensemble encoding the behaviorally dominant orientation rule showed increased “alpha” (6–16 Hz) synchrony when preparing to apply the alternative (weaker) color rule. This suggests that beta-frequency synchrony selects the relevant rule ensemble, while alpha-frequency synchrony deselects a stronger, but currently irrelevant, ensemble.

Synchrony may act to dynamically shape task-relevant neural ensembles out of larger, overlapping circuits. Neural oscillations form neural ensembles Oscillatory-based ensembles may underlie cognitive flexibility A critical cognitive ability is the flexibility to change one’s behavior based on context. Day-to-day life is full of such situations. For example, one often answers their phone when it rings but mutes it in a lecture. These context-dependent stimulus-response mappings are called “rules.” By allowing us to quickly adapt to specific situations, rules endow the cognitive flexibility crucial for intelligent behavior. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is key to rule-based behaviors (Miller and Cohen, 2001Miller E.K. Cohen J.D. An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 167-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (8468) Google Scholar). Rule-based tasks, especially those involving rule switching, activate the human PFC (Dove et al., 2000Dove A. Pollmann S.

Neuropsychological studies of the frontal lobes.Psychol. Bull. 1984; 95: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Many PFC neurons encode task rules (White and Wise, 1999White I.M. Wise S.P. Rule-dependent neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex.Exp. Brain Res. 1999; 126: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar; Wallis et al., 2001Wallis J.D. Anderson K.C. Miller E.K. Single neurons in prefrontal cortex encode abstract rules.Nature. 2001; 411: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) and can “multiplex,” encoding different task information (rule, stimulus, etc.) in different contexts (Rainer et al., 1999Rainer G. Rao S.C. Miller E.K. Prospective coding for objects in primate prefrontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5493-5505PubMed Google Scholar; Cromer et al., 2010Cromer J.A. Roy J.E. Miller E.K. Representation of multiple, independent categories in the primate prefrontal cortex.Neuron. 2010; 66: 796-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recent theoretical work suggests that this diversity of PFC neuron properties underlies the capacity to encode a large number of diverse rules (Rigotti et al., 2010Rigotti M. Ben Dayan Rubin D. Wang X.J. Fusi S. Internal representation of task rules by recurrent dynamics: the importance of the diversity of neural responses.Front Comput Neurosci. 2010; 4: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). But this diversity raises the question of how PFC circuits satisfy two competing demands: form the neural ensembles that represent the current rule while allowing for their flexible reconfiguration when the rule changes. One proposed solution is synchronized network oscillations. Oscillations can establish ensembles of neurons in a task-dependent, flexible manner (Akam and Kullmann, 2010Akam T. Kullmann D.M. Oscillations and filtering networks support flexible routing of information.Neuron. 2010; 67: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), allowing ensembles to be dynamically “carved” from a greater, heterogeneous population of neurons. In addition, coincident activity has a supralinear effect on downstream neurons (Aertsen et al., 1989Aertsen A.M. Gerstein G.L. Habib M.K. Palm G. Dynamics of neuronal firing correlation: modulation of “effective connectivity”.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 900-917PubMed Google Scholar), increasing the impact of neural ensemble activity on function (Fries, 2005Fries P. A mechanism for cognitive dynamics: neuronal communication through neuronal coherence.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2005; 9: 474-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility, we trained two monkeys to switch between two rules: respond to either the color or orientation of a stimulus (Figure 1A). After acquiring a central fixation target, a rule cue indicated whether the color or orientation rule was now relevant. Two different cues were used for each rule in order to disassociate neural selectivity for the cue from the rule (see Experimental Procedures). After a brief, randomized interval, a test stimulus appeared. The test stimulus consisted of small shapes that were either red or blue and were either vertically or horizontally aligned (Figure 1A). Depending on the current stimulus and rule, monkeys made a leftward or rightward saccade (color rule: red = left, blue = right; orientation rule: horizontal = left, vertical = right; Figure 1A). On most trials (70%), the color and orientation of the test stimulus signaled incongruent responses to ensure that the animals consistently followed the rule (e.g., a red/vertical cued different saccade directions under different rules). The same rule was repeated for at least 20 trials before a probabilistic switch. Monkeys performed well (∼90% of trials were correct) but, like humans, were slower to respond on the first trial after switch, compared to repeated rule trials (Allport et al., 1994Allport D.A. Styles E.A. Hsieh S. Shifting intentional set: Exploring the dynamic control of tasks.in: Umilta C. Moscovitch M. Attention and Performance XV: Conscious and Nonconscious Information Processing. The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1994: 421-452Google Scholar; Rogers and Monsell, 1995Rogers R.D. Monsell S. Costs of a predictable switch between simple cognitive tasks.J. Exp. Psychol. Gen. 1995; 124: 207-231Crossref Scopus (2461) Google Scholar; Caselli and Chelazzi, 2011Caselli L. Chelazzi L. Does the macaque monkey provide a good model for studying human executive control? A comparative behavioral study of task switching.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e21489Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This reaction time “switch cost” is thought to reflect the cognitive effort needed to change rules. However, it was only observed after a switch from orientation to color rule and not vice versa (Figure 1B; p = 1.61 × 10−4, generalized linear model [GLM], see Table S1 available online). This suggests that the orientation rule was behaviorally dominant, as the animals had more difficulty switching away from it. We quantified neural information about the cued rule using a bias-corrected percent explained variance statistic (ωPEV, see Supplemental Information for details). The majority of PFC neurons carried rule information (Figure 2A, PFC: 225/313, randomization test, cluster corrected for multiple comparisons, see Figure S1A for an example neuron). Similar numbers of neurons had higher firing rates during orientation and color rule trials (108 and 117, respectively, p = 0.25, binomial test). Across the population of PFC neurons, rule selectivity increased after the rule cue, although some baseline rule information was observed due to the task design: the rule repeated for multiple trials before a switch (Figure 2A). PFC neurons were also selective for the color or orientation of the test stimulus (104/313, 33%; 126/313, 40%, respectively). Orientation was behaviorally dominant (see above) and neural selectivity for it was more common than color (p = 3.9 × 10−3, binomial test), stronger across the population (Figure 2B and Figure S1C), and appeared slightly earlier (41.1 versus 47.6 ms after stimulus onset; p = 0.0026, permutation test). We found rule-selective oscillatory synchronization of local field potentials (LFPs) between individual PFC electrode pairs. There were significant differences in synchrony between the rules in two frequency bands during two separate trial epochs: “alpha” (6–16 Hz) after the rule cue and “beta” (19–40 Hz) after test stimulus appeared (179/465 and 207/465 recorded pairs at p < 0.05 in alpha and beta, respectively; Figure 3A and Figure S2A, alpha/beta shown as solid/dashed outlines). This was not due to differences in evoked potential (Figure S2E) or oscillatory power (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). It was also not due to volume conduction of an evoked potential: many rule-selective electrode pairs were spatially interspersed with electrodes with either the opposite or no synchronous rule preference (22/79 or 28%, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details) and rule-selective synchrony did not monotonically decrease with distance (Figure S2C). Beta oscillations increase with cognitive effort (Buschman and Miller, 2007Buschman T.J. Miller E.K. Top-down versus bottom-up control of attention in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices.Science. 2007; 315: 1860-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar; Pesaran et al., 2008Pesaran B. Nelson M.J. Andersen R.A. Free choice activates a decision circuit between frontal and parietal cortex.Nature. 2008; 453: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar; Kopell et al., 2010Kopell N. Kramer M.A. Malerba P. Whittington M.A. Are different rhythms good for different functions?.Front Hum Neurosci. 2010; 4: 187Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we sorted electrode pairs by which rule elicited significantly stronger beta synchrony. This identified two ensembles: one synchronized during the orientation rule (n = 117 out of 465 pairs, p < 10−15, binomial test against the number expected by chance) and one during the color rule (n = 90, p < 10−15, binomial test). There were significantly more electrode pairs with significantly stronger beta synchrony for the orientation rule than the color rule (Figure 3B, p = 8.8 × 10−4), again consistent with orientation being dominant. The magnitude of rule-selective increases in synchrony were comparable to those previously observed during attention (Figures 4 and S3; Buschman and Miller, 2007Buschman T.J. Miller E.K. Top-down versus bottom-up control of attention in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices.Science. 2007; 315: 1860-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar; Gregoriou et al., 2009Gregoriou G.G. Gotts S.J. Zhou H. Desimone R. High-frequency, long-range coupling between prefrontal and visual cortex during attention.Science. 2009; 324: 1207-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Rule-selective synchrony between electrodes was not between isolated electrode pairs. Rather, synchrony occurred within interconnected networks: individual electrode sites were synchronized to an average of 2.6 and 1.8 other sites for the orientation and color rule ensembles, respectively (maximum possible was 5.0, based on the number of simultaneously recorded electrodes). This degree of interconnectedness was significantly greater than expected for a random network (p < 10−3 for both, permutation test, see Supplemental Information for details). These rule-dependent networks were highly overlapping spatially (see Figure S2D for anatomical localization of networks). The majority of recording sites that selectively increased synchrony with one set of electrodes during one rule also increased synchrony with a different set of electrodes during the other rule (58% of electrodes participating in an orientation rule-preferring pair, 52% of color rule-preferring pair, see Supplemental Information). LFP synchrony may reflect functional ensembles of spiking neurons (Fries, 2005Fries P. A mechanism for cognitive dynamics: neuronal communication through neuronal coherence.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2005; 9: 474-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that both stimulus- and rule-selective neurons showed rule-dependent spike LFP synchrony. When the orientation or color rule was relevant, neurons with selectivity for the relevant test stimulus modality (Figure 5A) and/or the current rule (Figure 5B) were more synchronized to the currently activated beta band color or orientation ensemble (see Supplemental Information for details). Spike-field synchrony was largely observed at beta-band frequencies, particularly for orientation rule trials (Figure 5, left column). During color rule trials, synchrony was shifted slightly toward higher frequencies (Figure 5, right column). This may reflect differences in the underlying architecture of the rule-selective ensemble either locally or between PFC and sensory and/or motor regions (Siegel et al., 2012Siegel M. Donner T.H. Engel A.K. Spectral fingerprints of large-scale neuronal interactions.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 121-134PubMed Google Scholar). Alpha synchrony increases were primarily limited to color rule trials. Figure 3B shows that most of the electrode pairs that showed significant increases in synchrony in the alpha band did so when the color rule was cued. To examine this more closely, we plotted the beta synchrony-defined orientation and color ensembles separately (Figure 6). When separated, it is clear that while increases in alpha synchrony were on color trials, they were primarily limited to the orientation rule ensemble (Figure 6, left column). Indeed, electrode pairs with increased alpha synchrony during the color rule were more likely to show increased beta synchrony for the orientation rule than color rule (55/117 and 24/90 pairs, respectively; p < 10−5, permutation test). Synchronized alpha activity may reflect inhibition of task-irrelevant processing (Ray and Cole, 1985Ray W.J. Cole H.W.

Romo R. Jensen O. α-Oscillations in the monkey sensorimotor network influence discrimination performance by rhythmical inhibition of neuronal spiking.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 19377-19382Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Thus, alpha synchrony during color trials may reflect “deselection” of the dominant (but currently irrelevant) orientation ensemble, allowing the weaker (but currently relevant) color ensemble to be boosted. Indeed, alpha increases in the orientation rule ensemble were associated with enhancement of individual color rule neurons. Alpha power during the preparatory interval of color trials was positively correlated with the activity level of color rule-preferring, but not orientation rule-preferring, neurons during rule application to the test stimulus (Figure S4, correlation coefficient of 0.014, p = 0.0019 versus 0.003, p = 0.47, for color and orientation rule-preferring neurons, respectively, for 100 ms after stimulus onset; color > orientation, p = 0.047, see Supplemental Information for details). There was no direct evidence for suppression of the orientation ensemble (e.g., a negative correlation between alpha power and the activity of orientation-preferring neurons on color trials). However, these neurons are already suppressed during the color rule, so further suppression may be harder to detect. Synchrony at both alpha and beta was correlated with behavioral reaction time, further suggesting their functional role. There was significantly stronger rule-selective synchrony in both bands on trials with shorter reaction times (Figure 7; alpha: p = 3.43 × 10−10, beta: p = 2.71 × 10−3, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), even after controlling for the effects of preparatory time and rule on reaction time (see Table S1). This stronger synchrony with faster reaction times occurred prior to test stimulus for both alpha and beta (Figure 7; stronger selectivity in beta: −20 to 0 ms, alpha: −240 to 0 ms prior to stimulus onset, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.05, Bonferroni correction), suggesting preparatory facilitation of test stimulus processing. Our results suggest distinct synchronous PFC ensembles support different rules. Rule-selective beta-band synchrony may help to dynamically link neurons in order to support task performance. Indeed, task-relevant (rule- and stimulus-selective) neurons were more synchronized to the corresponding ensemble for the current rule. Similar organization of neural activity by synchronous population oscillations have been seen during sensory processing (Lakatos et al., 2008Lakatos P. Karmos G. Mehta A.D. Ulbert I. Schroeder C.E. Entrainment of neuronal oscillations as a mechanism of attentional selection.Science. 2008; 320: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) and attention (Buschman and Miller, 2009Buschman T.J.

This synchrony-based linking of neurons into ensembles could be an ideal mechanism for cognitive flexibility, allowing ensembles of task-relevant neurons to be dynamically formed and reformed (Sejnowski and Paulsen, 2006Sejnowski T.J.

Our results are consistent with recent evidence from humans and monkeys suggesting that beta oscillations play a major role in top-down organization of neural processing (Engel and Fries, 2010Engel A.K.

Further, beta synchronization increases in anticipation of an upcoming stimulus and is stronger when a stimulus is more predictable (Liang et al., 2002Liang H. Bressler S.L. Ding M. Truccolo W.A.

Prestimulus cortical activity is correlated with speed of visuomotor processing.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2008; 20: 1915-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similarly, we observed that rule-selective beta synchronization in anticipation of the test stimulus was correlated with the animal’s reaction time. Orientation seemed to be the dominant modality. This may be due to its relative saliency, much like word naming in the Stroop test (MacLeod, 1991MacLeod C.M. Half a century of research on the Stroop effect: an integrative review.Psychol. Bull. 1991; 109: 163-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (4028) Google Scholar). We found the orientation ensemble, which was synchronized at beta-band frequencies during the orientation rule, had increased alpha-band synchrony when color was relevant.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 10243-10250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In particular, alpha oscillations during attention are suppressed in the task-relevant sensorimotor cortices, enhanced in the task-irrelevant cortices, and can influence discriminability of stimuli (Worden et al., 2000Worden M.S.

Top-down controlled alpha band activity in somatosensory areas determines behavioral performance in a discrimination task.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 5197-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Because of this, it has been suggested that enhanced alpha synchronization creates an inhibition of irrelevant processes (Klimesch et al., 2007Klimesch W. Sauseng P. Hanslmayr S. EEG alpha oscillations: the inhibition-timing hypothesis.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2007; 53: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar; Mathewson et al., 2011Mathewson K.E. Lleras A.

Pulsed out of awareness: EEG alpha oscillations represent a pulsed-inhibition of ongoing cortical processing.Front Psychol. 2011; 2: 99Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Our study is consistent with this model: alpha synchronization may allow the weaker color ensemble to be activated over the stronger (orientation) ensemble when color is relevant. In support, we observed an increase in the activity of color-selective neurons after an increase in alpha in the orientation ensemble. These results suggest a dual model of competition between ensembles of neurons: beta synchrony selects the relevant ensemble, while alpha may deselect the irrelevant, but dominant, ensemble so that a weaker, relevant one can be established. Similar dual mechanisms may bias competition between stimuli during focal attention, leading to high-frequency synchronization of neural activity representing attended stimuli (Fries et al., 2001Fries P.

https://openalex.org/W2002697796,"Inhibitors of the ALK and EGF receptor tyrosine kinases provoke dramatic but short-lived responses in lung cancers harboring EML4-ALK translocations or activating mutations of EGFR, respectively. We used a large-scale RNAi screen to identify MED12, a component of the transcriptional MEDIATOR complex that is mutated in cancers, as a determinant of response to ALK and EGFR inhibitors. MED12 is in part cytoplasmic where it negatively regulates TGF-βR2 through physical interaction. MED12 suppression therefore results in activation of TGF-βR signaling, which is both necessary and sufficient for drug resistance. TGF-β signaling causes MEK/ERK activation, and consequently MED12 suppression also confers resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors in other cancers. MED12 loss induces an EMT-like phenotype, which is associated with chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer patients and to gefitinib in lung cancer. Inhibition of TGF-βR signaling restores drug responsiveness in MED12(KD) cells, suggesting a strategy to treat drug-resistant tumors that have lost MED12."

https://openalex.org/W2141830087,"Internal nutrient sensors play important roles in feeding behavior, yet their molecular structure and mechanism of action are poorly understood. Using Ca(2+) imaging and behavioral assays, we show that the gustatory receptor 43a (Gr43a) functions as a narrowly tuned fructose receptor in taste neurons. Remarkably, Gr43a also functions as a fructose receptor in the brain. Interestingly, hemolymph fructose levels are tightly linked to feeding status: after nutritious carbohydrate consumption, fructose levels rise several fold and reach a concentration sufficient to activate Gr43a in the brain. By using different feeding paradigms and artificial activation of Gr43a-expressing brain neurons, we show that Gr43a is both necessary and sufficient to sense hemolymph fructose and promote feeding in hungry flies but suppress feeding in satiated flies. Thus, our studies indicate that the Gr43a-expressing brain neurons function as a nutrient sensor for hemolymph fructose and assign opposing valence to feeding experiences in a satiation-dependent manner."

Argonaute binding alters the properties of an RNA guide, creating functional domains. We show that the domains established by Argonaute-the anchor, seed, central, 3' supplementary, and tail regions-have distinct biochemical properties that explain the differences between how animal miRNAs and siRNAs bind their targets. Extensive complementarity between an siRNA and its target slows the rate at which fly Argonaute2 (Ago2) binds to and dissociates from the target. Highlighting its role in antiviral defense, fly Ago2 dissociates so slowly from extensively complementary target RNAs that essentially every fully paired target is cleaved. Conversely, mouse AGO2, which mainly mediates miRNA-directed repression, dissociates rapidly and with similar rates for fully paired and seed-matched targets. Our data narrow the range of biochemically reasonable models for how Argonaute-bound siRNAs and miRNAs find, bind, and regulate their targets."

We show here by fate mapping, clonal analysis, and immunohistochemistry that endocardial cells generate the endothelium of coronary arteries. Dye tracking, live imaging, and tissue transplantation also revealed that ventricular endocardial cells are not terminally differentiated; instead, they are angiogenic and form coronary endothelial networks. Myocardial Vegf-a or endocardial Vegfr-2 deletion inhibited coronary angiogenesis and arterial formation by ventricular endocardial cells. In contrast, lineage and knockout studies showed that endocardial cells make a small contribution to the coronary veins, the formation of which is independent of myocardial-to-endocardial Vegf signaling. Thus, contrary to the current view of a common source for the coronary vessels, our findings indicate that the coronary arteries and veins have distinct origins and are formed by different mechanisms. This information may help develop better cell therapies for coronary artery disease."
https://openalex.org/W1990233086,"Signaling pathways are intimately involved in cellular differentiation, allowing cells to respond to their environment by regulating gene expression. Although enhancers are recognized as key elements that regulate selective gene expression, the interplay between signaling pathways and actively used enhancer elements is not clear. Here, we use CD4(+) T cells as a model of differentiation, mapping the activity of cell-type-specific enhancer elements in T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cells. Our data establish that STAT proteins have a major impact on the activation of lineage-specific enhancers and the suppression of enhancers associated with alternative cell fates. Transcriptome analysis further supports a functional role for enhancers regulated by STATs. Importantly, expression of lineage-defining master regulators in STAT-deficient cells fails to fully recover the chromatin signature of STAT-dependent enhancers. Thus, these findings point to a critical role of STATs as environmental sensors in dynamically molding the specialized enhancer architecture of differentiating cells."

We show that these phosphorylated ribosomes can be captured from mouse brain homogenates, thereby enriching directly for the mRNAs expressed in discrete subpopulations of activated cells. We use this approach to identify neurons in the hypothalamus regulated by changes in salt balance or food availability. We show that galanin neurons are activated by fasting and that prodynorphin neurons restrain food intake during scheduled feeding. These studies identify elements of the neural circuit that controls food intake and illustrate how the activity-dependent capture of cell-type-specific transcripts can elucidate the functional organization of a complex tissue."

During multisample perceptual categorization, we found that the neural encoding of momentary evidence in human electrical brain signals and its subsequent impact on choice fluctuated rhythmically according to the phase of ongoing parietal delta oscillations (1-3 Hz). By contrast, lateralized beta-band power (10-30 Hz) overlying human motor cortex encoded the integrated evidence as a response preparation signal. These findings draw a clear distinction between central and motor stages of perceptual decision making, with successive samples of sensory evidence competing to pass through a serial processing bottleneck before being mapped onto action."
https://openalex.org/W2128284302,"By pairing acoustic stimuli and electrical stimulation of the nucleus basalis neuromodulatory system in rats, the authors show an induction of long-lasting synaptic modifications of the auditory cortex that conserved excitation across the auditory receptive fields. This type of modification also improved auditory sensory detection and behavioral performance in tone perception. Synapses and receptive fields of the cerebral cortex are plastic. However, changes to specific inputs must be coordinated within neural networks to ensure that excitability and feature selectivity are appropriately configured for perception of the sensory environment. We induced long-lasting enhancements and decrements to excitatory synaptic strength in rat primary auditory cortex by pairing acoustic stimuli with activation of the nucleus basalis neuromodulatory system. Here we report that these synaptic modifications were approximately balanced across individual receptive fields, conserving mean excitation while reducing overall response variability. Decreased response variability should increase detection and recognition of near-threshold or previously imperceptible stimuli. We confirmed both of these hypotheses in behaving animals. Thus, modification of cortical inputs leads to wide-scale synaptic changes, which are related to improved sensory perception and enhanced behavioral performance."
https://openalex.org/W1992144732,"The role of the immune response to oncolytic Herpes simplex viral (oHSV) therapy for glioblastoma is controversial because it might enhance or inhibit efficacy.

This response substantially diminished the efficacy of glioblastoma virotherapy. oHSV-activated NK cells coordinated macrophage and microglia activation within tumors. In vitro, human NK cells preferentially lysed oHSV-infected human glioblastoma cell lines. This enhanced killing depended on the NK cell natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) NKp30 and NKp46, whose ligands are upregulated in oHSV-infected glioblastoma cells. We found that HSV titers and oHSV efficacy are increased in Ncr1(-/-) mice and a Ncr1(-/-) NK cell adoptive transfer model of glioma, respectively.

XCI is critical for mammalian development, and epigenetic processes required for XCI, most notably gene silencing mediated by Polycomb group proteins and noncoding RNA, play important roles in many biological phenomena (Surface et al., 2010Surface L.E. Thornton S.R. Boyer L.A. Polycomb group proteins set the stage for early lineage commitment.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 288-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As such, XCI is a paradigm for epigenetic silencing mediated by noncoding RNA. Two waves of XCI occur in the mouse. The first, imprinted XCI, initiates at the eight-cell stage of development and results in inactivation of the paternally inherited X chromosome (Kalantry et al., 2009Kalantry S. Purushothaman S.

Evidence of Xist RNA-independent initiation of mouse imprinted X-chromosome inactivation.Nature. 2009; 460: 647-651PubMed Google Scholar; Patrat et al., 2009Patrat C. Okamoto I. Diabangouaya P.

USA. 2009; 106: 5198-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Imprinted XCI is maintained in extraembryonic cells, whereas cells from the inner mass reactivate their paternal X during blastocyst maturation (Williams et al., 2011Williams L.H. Kalantry S. Starmer J. Magnuson T. Transcription precedes loss of Xist coating and depletion of H3K27me3 during X-chromosome reprogramming in the mouse inner cell mass.Development. 2011; 138: 2049-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). XCI then reoccurs within the inner cell mass, randomly selecting the paternal or maternal X for silencing (Escamilla-Del-Arenal et al., 2011Escamilla-Del-Arenal M. da Rocha S.T. Heard E. Evolutionary diversity and developmental regulation of X-chromosome inactivation.Hum. Genet. 2011; 130: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The inactive X chromosome (Xi) is distinguished from autosomes by several salient features. An ∼17 kb noncoding RNA, Xist, is expressed from and coats the Xi in cis, and is required for the early maintenance of XCI (Kalantry et al., 2009Kalantry S. Purushothaman S. Bowen R.B. Starmer J.

Xist coating results in widespread Xi deposition of H3-lysine27-trimethylation (H3K27me3), catalyzed by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). After coating, the Xi can be visualized microscopically with antibodies recognizing H3K27me3 or PRC2 components (Mak et al., 2002Mak W. Baxter J. Silva J. Newall A.E. Otte A.P. Brockdorff N.

PRC2 is required for maintenance of XCI during differentiation of extraembryonic lineages (Kalantry et al., 2006Kalantry S. Mills K.C. Yee D. Otte A.P. Panning B. Magnuson T.

Mechtler K. Spahn L. Koseki H. Jenuwein T. Wutz A. Recruitment of PRC1 function at the initiation of X inactivation independent of PRC2 and silencing.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3110-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The Xi’s physical territory is microscopically devoid of transcription-associated hallmarks, including RNA polymerase II (Pol II), histone H3-acetylation, and histone H3-lysine4-methylation (H3K4me) (Escamilla-Del-Arenal et al., 2011Escamilla-Del-Arenal M. da Rocha S.T. Heard E. Evolutionary diversity and developmental regulation of X-chromosome inactivation.Hum. Genet. 2011; 130: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Exclusion of these marks from the Xi’s territory is Xist-dependent and occurs during initiation of XCI. Movement of genes into the territory is coincident with silencing (Chaumeil et al., 2006Chaumeil J. Le Baccon P. Wutz A. Heard E. A novel role for Xist RNA in the formation of a repressive nuclear compartment into which genes are recruited when silenced.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2223-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Whether relocation itself causes gene silencing or is simply correlated with XCI is unclear (Escamilla-Del-Arenal et al., 2011Escamilla-Del-Arenal M. da Rocha S.T. Heard E. Evolutionary diversity and developmental regulation of X-chromosome inactivation.Hum. Genet. 2011; 130: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The content of X-linked DNA is additionally noteworthy. Approximately 35% of human and mouse X-linked DNA is derived from LINE repeats, compared to ∼20% of autosomal DNA (Fujita et al., 2011Fujita P.A. Rhead B. Zweig A.S. Hinrichs A.S. Karolchik D. Cline M.S. Goldman M. Barber G.P. Clawson H. Coelho A. et al.The UCSC Genome Browser database: update 2011.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D876-D882Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Due to this enrichment, LINEs were thought to be conduits for Xist and associated silencing factors as they coat the Xi, although recent work argues a more indirect role for LINEs in this process (Tattermusch and Brockdorff, 2011Tattermusch A. Brockdorff N. A scaffold for X chromosome inactivation.Hum. Genet. 2011; 130: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this regard, LINEs have been proposed to nucleate formation of a transcriptionally silent spatial core within the Xi, into which X-linked genes are recruited as they are silenced (Chaumeil et al., 2006Chaumeil J. Le Baccon P. Wutz A. Heard E.

Finally, although the majority of X-linked genes are silenced by XCI, a minority escapes X inactivation. The proportion and identity of escaping genes differs between cell types and ranges from 3% to 15% of X-linked genes (Carrel and Willard, 2005Carrel L. Willard H.F. X-inactivation profile reveals extensive variability in X-linked gene expression in females.Nature. 2005; 434: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar; Patrat et al., 2009Patrat C.

Global survey of escape from X inactivation by RNA-sequencing in mouse.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Mechanistic models suggest escaping genes are positioned exterior to the Xi’s silent domain, in contrast to X-inactivated genes, allowing escapers to efficiently access transcription machinery (Chaumeil et al., 2006Chaumeil J. Le Baccon P. Wutz A. Heard E. A novel role for Xist RNA in the formation of a repressive nuclear compartment into which genes are recruited when silenced.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2223-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The CTCF insulator protein may also play a critical role in licensing escape (Filippova et al., 2005Filippova G.N. Cheng M.K. Moore J.M. Truong J.P. Hu Y.J. Nguyen D.K. Tsuchiya K.D. Disteche C.M. Boundaries between chromosomal domains of X inactivation and escape bind CTCF and lack CpG methylation during early development.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 31-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although well studied on a microscopic level, there is little quantitative information regarding Xi chromatin at submicroscopic resolution. Understanding the epigenetic states of individual regulatory elements over the Xi is critical to a complete mechanistic understanding of XCI. Therefore, via a combination of allele-specific RNA-, ChIP-, FAIRE-, and DNase-Seq, we profiled X-linked chromatin patterns at the submicroscopic scale in mouse trophoblast stem cells (TSCs), which are subject to imprinted XCI. The resulting gene expression and chromatin maps solidify TSCs as a platform for understanding the maintenance of XCI in a stem cell population. Our analysis revealed unexpected properties of X-inactivated and escaping genes, both in terms of their epigenetic signatures, as well as their subnuclear localization patterns in TSCs and also in cells subject to random XCI. Together, our results suggest a model whereby the major mechanism of transcriptional silencing associated with maintenance of XCI is not a simple chromosome-wide separation from transcription machinery but rather localized occlusion of Pol II from specific sites along the Xi. In order to study XCI in a natural context and still differentiate between the active X (Xa) and Xi when analyzing gene expression and chromatin patterns, we chose to study XCI in female TSCs, where inactivation patterns are nonrandom. Because TSCs maintain imprinted XCI, their Xa and Xi are maternally and paternally inherited, respectively, and SNP-overlapping sequence reads in these cells reliably trace chromosome of origin (Quinn et al., 2006Quinn J. Kunath T. Rossant J. Mouse trophoblast stem cells.Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 121: 125-148PubMed Google Scholar). As a prerequisite for understanding the relationship between Xi chromatin patterns and gene silencing, we began our study by measuring allelic gene expression via strand-specific RNA-Seq in female TSC lines derived from crosses between CAST/EiJ (Cast) and C57BL/6J (B6) mice. Considering our goal of relating expression to Xi chromatin patterns, and that the most accurate build of the genome is B6-derived, downstream chromatin analyses focused on a TSC line with a Cast Xa and B6 Xi (C/B). RNA-Seq was performed on an additional TSC line carrying a B6 Xa and Cast Xi (B/C), in order to help differentiate between strain- and parent-of-origin-specific expression biases. The two female TSC lines were selected for RNA-Seq based on normal karyotypes and expression of TSC-specific markers (data not shown). TSC poly-adenylated RNA was collected, and replicate cDNA libraries were prepared and sequenced (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R. Weissman J.S. Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar; Table S1 available online). SNP-overlapping reads were identified, and allelic expression was calculated by dividing the number of B6- or Cast-overlapping reads by the total number of allelic reads per gene. The resulting expression maps served as a necessary baseline for the subsequent interpretation of X-linked chromatin patterns. Internal consistency and experimental validation indicated RNA-Seq data to be of high quality. R2 values comparing gene expression between C/B and B/C replicates were 0.970 and 0.985, respectively; this same comparison between the two TSC lines gave an R2 of 0.917. Moreover, nine genes were selected for validation via a quantitative allele-specific RT-PCR assay and in all cases measured allelic ratios and sequencing data were concordant (Figure S1). We next determined what genes were subject to and escaped TSC XCI, examining genes with ≥20 SNP-overlapping reads in both TSC lines. Previous analyses used a cutoff of 10% Xi expression to differentiate between X-inactivated and escaping genes (Carrel and Willard, 2005Carrel L. Willard H.F. X-inactivation profile reveals extensive variability in X-linked gene expression in females.Nature. 2005; 434: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar; Yang et al., 2010Yang F. Babak T. Shendure J. Disteche C.M. Global survey of escape from X inactivation by RNA-sequencing in mouse.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We sought to empirically define TSC escape, reasoning that a 10% cutoff might exclude true escapers. Allelic expression data were fit to a mixture of beta binomial distributions, allowing us to determine the probability of escape per gene (Extended Experimental Procedures). For each gene, the proportion of Xi expression, the total number of escaping reads, and the sequence quality scores of SNP-overlapping bases within these reads were accounted for in escape determination. Thirteen percent of genes (35 from 262 eligible) escaped XCI to varying degrees (Figure 1; Tables S2 and S3). Escape did not occur in predictable patterns along the Xi; genes escaped in isolation or in groups. With Xist as the major exception, escapers remained predominantly Xa expressed, displaying a median of ∼15% expression from the Xi. Twenty-seven escapers exhibited at least 10% Xi expression. In contrast, X-inactivated genes had a median of ∼0.5% Xi expression, and there was no correlation between inactivation strength and gene distance from Xist (R2 0.07 and 0.04 for C/B and B/C, respectively; Figure 1). Genes that escaped XCI in TSCs also escaped in other tissues. We analyzed allelic expression via PCR in day 6.5 embryonic tissue and found the four genes tested escaped in the ectoplacental cone and extraembryonic ectoderm (data not shown). Additionally, about 1/2 of escapers identified in mouse tissues subject to random XCI also escaped TSC XCI; 7 of 13 escapers from embryonic kidney cells (Yang et al., 2010Yang F. Babak T. Shendure J. Disteche C.M. Global survey of escape from X inactivation by RNA-sequencing in mouse.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and 10 of 20 escapers from neural precursor cells (Splinter et al., 2011Splinter E. de Wit E. Nora E.P. Klous P. van de Werken H.J. Zhu Y. Kaaij L.J. van Ijcken W. Gribnau J. Heard E. de Laat W. The inactive X chromosome adopts a unique three-dimensional conformation that is dependent on Xist RNA.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1371-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), escaped in TSCs. Finally, we noted that Xi genetic background significantly affected TSC escape profiles. About 1/2 of escapers did so in both TSC lines; however, 11 genes escaped only in C/B TSCs and 8 only in B/C TSCs (blue and green dots, Figure 1). Allelic PCR in independently derived TSC lines verified that the majority of differential escape was heritable and not TSC line specific (Figure S1). Having established an allelic expression map of the TSC X chromosome, we initiated our analysis of X-linked epigenetic patterns at high resolution via ChIP-Seq in C/B TSCs. The overarching goal of these experiments was to characterize the submicroscopic chromatin signatures over the TSC Xi and quantitatively examine how these signatures related to gene expression, DNA features, and known microscopic properties of the chromosome (Escamilla-Del-Arenal et al., 2011Escamilla-Del-Arenal M. da Rocha S.T. Heard E. Evolutionary diversity and developmental regulation of X-chromosome inactivation.Hum. Genet. 2011; 130: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The survey initially centered on H3K27me3, which is required for XCI maintenance in extraembryonic cells (Kalantry et al., 2006Kalantry S. Mills K.C. Yee D. Otte A.P. Panning B. Magnuson T.

Imprinted X inactivation maintained by a mouse Polycomb group gene.Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Additional ChIP-Seq data sets were generated for repression-associated histone H4-lysine20-monomethylation (H4K20me1), which also microscopically coats the TSC Xi, as well as marks associated with active transcription, such as Pol II, H3K4me2, and histone H3-lysine36-trimethylation (H3K36me3), and total histone H3 (H3). Both autosomal and X-linked ChIP-Seq data showed expected allelic distributions. Although the Cast-to-B6 allelic ratios were approximately 1:1 in all data sets, they showed a slight bias toward the reference genome (Figure 2A). In contrast, allelic biases were skewed over the X chromosomes in a manner consistent with data from classical immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy experiments (Escamilla-Del-Arenal et al., 2011Escamilla-Del-Arenal M. da Rocha S.T. Heard E. Evolutionary diversity and developmental regulation of X-chromosome inactivation.Hum. Genet. 2011; 130: 307-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); active marks were biased toward the Cast genome, or Xa, and repressive marks were biased toward the B6 genome, or Xi (Figure 2B). The tiling densities of H3K27me3 and H4K20me1 were next examined in order to quantitatively address how their microscopic Xi enrichments related to specific chromosomal regions (Figure 2C). Both marks exhibited large-scale density fluctuation over the X with megabase-sized regions of enrichment and depletion (Figure 2C, right). These X-linked profiles had a Spearman coefficient of 0.88, higher than their autosomal correlation of 0.46. X-linked H3K27me3 and H4K20me1 patterns also contrasted with chromosome 1 patterns, for example, where enriched regions were more punctate (Figure 2C, left). Importantly, allelic data showed the major patterns of X-linked H3K27me3 and H4K20me1 enrichment reflected those of the Xi (Figure 2C, right versus 2D). Previous studies have shown both H3K27me3 and Xist colocalize with gene- and not LINE-dense regions of the Xi (Chadwick, 2007Chadwick B.P.

We addressed the relationship between X-linked H3K27me3 density, genes, and LINEs, continuing to fit our data in context with previous observations before examining more detailed epigenetic aspects of the TSC Xi. Tiling density plots over the TSC X showed reciprocal relationships between H3K27me3 levels and genes and LINEs (Figure 3A). H3K27me3 and gene density positively correlated over the X (Spearman coefficient 0.29; Figure 3A, middle versus bottom). In contrast, X-linked LINE and H3K27me3 density were inversely correlated (Spearman coefficient −0.57; Figure 3A, middle versus top). Almost invariably, peaks of LINE density colocalized with valleys of H3K27me3 density and vice versa (Figures 3A, S2A, and S2B). The continuity of H3 density within LINE-dense regions validated our ability to detect and normalize for H3K27me3 within these regions.Figure S2Approximate Divisions of Major H3K27me3 Peaks and Valleys along the Xi, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Tiling density plots of H3K27me3 and total H3 across the X, with approximate boundaries of H3K27me3 major peaks (blue boxes) and valleys (gray boxes).

Considering the different H3K27me3 levels between LINE- and gene-dense regions of the TSC Xi, it was difficult to reconcile how these sequence classes would occupy the same nuclear space.

Using H3K27me3 IF combined with DNA FISH, we examined the locations of five X-linked FISH probe pairs relative to the H3K27me3 coat.

https://openalex.org/W1995214286,"Motor actions are facilitated when expected reward value is high. It is hypothesized that there are neurons that encode expected reward values to modulate impending actions and potentially represent motivation signals. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the ventral pallidum (VP) may participate in this process. We recorded single neuronal activity in the monkey VP using a saccade task with a direction-dependent reward bias. Depending on the amount of the expected reward, VP neurons increased or decreased their activity tonically until the reward was delivered, for both ipsiversive and contraversive saccades. Changes in expected reward values were also associated with changes in saccade performance (latency and velocity). Furthermore, bilateral muscimol-induced inactivation of the VP abolished the reward-dependent changes in saccade latencies. These data suggest that the VP provides expected reward value signals that are used to facilitate or inhibit motor actions."
https://openalex.org/W2161564843,"Microcephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder causing significantly reduced cerebral cortex size. Many known microcephaly gene products localize to centrosomes, regulating cell fate and proliferation. Here, we identify and characterize a nuclear zinc finger protein, ZNF335/NIF-1, as a causative gene for severe microcephaly, small somatic size, and neonatal death. Znf335 null mice are embryonically lethal, and conditional knockout leads to severely reduced cortical size. RNA-interference and postmortem human studies show that ZNF335 is essential for neural progenitor self-renewal, neurogenesis, and neuronal differentiation. ZNF335 is a component of a vertebrate-specific, trithorax H3K4-methylation complex, directly regulating REST/NRSF, a master regulator of neural gene expression and cell fate, as well as other essential neural-specific genes. Our results reveal ZNF335 as an essential link between H3K4 complexes and REST/NRSF and provide the first direct genetic evidence that this pathway regulates human neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2027080373,"A new mechanism of chromosomal rearrangement is identified through the observation that broken or collapsed DNA replication forks restarted by homologous recombination have a high propensity for U-turns at short inverted repeats; the error-prone nature of this mechanism is suggested to contribute to gross chromosomal rearrangements and copy-number variations present in cancer and other genomic disorders. Stress that causes broken or collapsed DNA replication forks can induce copy-number variations (CNVs) and gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs), both of which are commonly found in cancer cells. Antony Carr and colleagues find that a collapsed fork that has been restarted by homologous recombination is more error prone than a fork that initiates at origins of replication. These restarted forks frequently perform U-turns at short inverted repeats, a possible cause of CNVs and GCRs. The authors suggest that the error-prone nature of restarted forks could be a source of cancer-causing gene abnormalities and spontaneous genetic disorders in the absence of a double-strand break. Impediments to DNA replication are known to induce gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) and copy-number variations (CNVs). GCRs and CNVs underlie human genomic disorders1 and are a feature of cancer2. During cancer development, environmental factors and oncogene-driven proliferation promote replication stress. Resulting GCRs and CNVs are proposed to contribute to cancer development and therapy resistance3. When stress arrests replication, the replisome remains associated with the fork DNA (stalled fork) and is protected by the inter-S-phase checkpoint. Stalled forks efficiently resume when the stress is relieved. However, if the polymerases dissociate from the fork (fork collapse) or the fork structure breaks (broken fork), replication restart can proceed either by homologous recombination or microhomology-primed re-initiation4,5. Here we ascertain the consequences of replication with a fork restarted by homologous recombination in fission yeast. We identify a new mechanism of chromosomal rearrangement through the observation that recombination-restarted forks have a considerably high propensity to execute a U-turn at small inverted repeats (up to 1 in 40 replication events). We propose that the error-prone nature of restarted forks contributes to the generation of GCRs and gene amplification in cancer, and to non-recurrent CNVs in genomic disorders."

The results reveal the molecular architecture of the cilium and provide insights into protein functions. They suggest that the ciliary rootlet is involved in cellular transport and stabilizes the axoneme. A defect in the BBSome membrane coat caused defects in vesicle targeting near the base of the cilium.

https://openalex.org/W4233420143,"Ewing sarcoma provides an important model for transcription-factor-mediated oncogenic transformation because of its reliance on the ETS-type fusion oncoprotein EWS/FLI. EWS/FLI functions as a transcriptional activator and transcriptional activation is required for its oncogenic activity. Here, we demonstrate that a previously less-well characterized transcriptional repressive function of the EWS/FLI fusion is also required for the transformed phenotype of Ewing sarcoma. Through comparison of EWS/FLI transcriptional profiling and genome-wide localization data, we define the complement of EWS/FLI direct downregulated target genes. We demonstrate that LOX is a previously undescribed EWS/FLI-repressed target that inhibits the transformed phenotype of Ewing sarcoma cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the NuRD co-repressor complex interacts with EWS/FLI, and that its associated histone deacetylase and LSD1 activities contribute to the repressive function. Taken together, these data reveal a previously unknown molecular function for EWS/FLI, demonstrate a more highly coordinated oncogenic transcriptional hierarchy mediated by EWS/FLI than previously suspected, and implicate a new paradigm for therapeutic intervention aimed at controlling NuRD activity in Ewing sarcoma tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1984803226,"Although radiotherapy improves survival in patients, glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs) tend to relapse with augmented tumor migration and invasion even after ionizing radiation (IR). Aberrant nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (Stat3) activation and interaction have been suggested in several human tumors. However, possible NF-κB/Stat3 interaction and the role of Stat3 in maintenance of NF-κB nuclear retention in GBM still remain unknown. Stat3 and NF-κB (p65) physically interact with one another in the nucleus in glioma tumors. Most importantly, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays identified that Stat3 binds to the p65 transactivation domain and is present in the NF-κB DNA-binding complex. Irradiation significantly elevated nuclear phospho-p65/phospho-Stat3 interaction in correlation with increased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and soluble-ICAM-1 levels, migration and invasion in human glioma xenograft cell lines 4910 and 5310. Chromatin immunopreicipitation and promoter luciferase activity assays confirmed the critical role of adjacent NF-κB (+399) and Stat3 (+479) binding motifs in the proximal intron-1 in elevating IR-induced ICAM-1 expression. Specific inhibition of Stat3 or NF-κB with Stat3.siRNA or JSH-23 severely inhibited IR-induced p65 recruitment onto ICAM-1 intron-1 and suppressed migratory properties in both the cell lines. On the other hand, Stat3C- or IR-induced Stat3 promoter recruitment was significantly decreased in p65-knockdown cells, thereby suggesting the reciprocal regulation between p65 and Stat3. We also observed a significant increase in NF-κB enrichment on ICAM-1 intron-1 and ICAM-1 transactivation in Stat3C overexpressing cells. In in vivo orthotopic experiments, suppression of tumor growth in Stat3.si+IR-treated mice was associated with the inhibition of IR-induced p-p65/p-Stat3 nuclear colocalization and ICAM-1 levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the crucial role of NF-κB/Stat3 nuclear association in IR-induced ICAM-1 regulation and implies that targeting NF-κB/Stat3 interaction may have future therapeutic significance in glioma treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2001215382,"Notch signaling is frequently hyperactivated in breast cancer, but how the enhanced signaling contributes to the tumor process is less well understood. In this report, we identify the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a novel Notch target in breast tumor cells. Enhanced Notch signaling upregulated IL-6 expression, leading to activation of autocrine and paracrine Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling. IL-6 upregulation was mediated by non-canonical Notch signaling, as it could be effectuated by a cytoplasmically localized Notch intracellular domain and was independent of the DNA-binding protein CSL. Instead, Notch-mediated IL-6 upregulation was controlled by two proteins in the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling cascade, IKKα and IKKβ (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha and beta, respectively), as well as by p53. Activation of IL-6 by Notch required IKKα/IKKβ function, but interestingly, did not engage canonical NF-κB signaling, in contrast to IL-6 activation by inflammatory agents such as lipopolysaccharide. With regard to p53 status, IL-6 expression was upregulated by Notch when p53 was mutated or lost, and restoring wild-type p53 into p53-mutated or -deficient cells abrogated the IL-6 upregulation. Furthermore, Notch-induced transcriptomes from p53 wild-type and -mutated breast tumor cell lines differed extensively, and for a subset of genes upregulated by Notch in a p53-mutant cell line, this upregulation was reduced by wild-type p53. In conclusion, we identify IL-6 as a novel non-canonical Notch target gene, and reveal roles for p53 and IKKα/IKKβ in non-canonical Notch signaling in breast cancer and in the generation of cell context-dependent diversity in the Notch signaling output."
https://openalex.org/W2091978286,"Patterning of Drosophila embryos involves the localization of RNAs to specific places in the oocytes before fertilization. Although both gurken (grk) and bicoid (bcd) mRNA localize to the dorsoanterior of the oocyte, only grk mRNA is translated at this stage. Davis and colleagues find that grk mRNA co-localizes with proteins involved in translation at the periphery of P bodies whereas bcd is enriched into their central region—which the authors show is devoid of ribosomes—where it is translationally repressed. The primary embryonic axes in flies, frogs and fish are formed through translational regulation of localized transcripts before fertilization1. In Drosophila melanogaster, the axes are established through the transport and translational regulation of gurken (grk) and bicoid (bcd) messenger RNA in the oocyte and embryo1. Both transcripts are translationally silent while being localized within the oocyte along microtubules by cytoplasmic dynein1,2,3,4. Once localized, grk is translated at the dorsoanterior of the oocyte to send a TGF- α signal to the overlying somatic cells5. In contrast, bcd is translationally repressed in the oocyte until its activation in early embryos when it forms an anteroposterior morphogenetic gradient6. How this differential translational regulation is achieved is not fully understood. Here, we address this question using ultrastructural analysis, super-resolution microscopy and live-cell imaging. We show that grk and bcd ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes associate with electron-dense bodies that lack ribosomes and contain translational repressors. These properties are characteristic of processing bodies (P bodies), which are considered to be regions of cytoplasm where decisions are made on the translation and degradation of mRNA. Endogenous grk mRNA forms dynamic RNP particles that become docked and translated at the periphery of P bodies, where we show that the translational activator Oo18 RNA-binding protein (Orb, a homologue of CEPB) and the anchoring factor Squid (Sqd) are also enriched. In contrast, an excess of grk mRNA becomes localized inside the P bodies, where endogenous bcd mRNA is localized and translationally repressed. Interestingly, bcd mRNA dissociates from P bodies in embryos following egg activation, when it is known to become translationally active. We propose a general principle of translational regulation during axis specification involving remodelling of transport RNPs and dynamic partitioning of different transcripts between the translationally active edge of P bodies and their silent core."

We use high-resolution optical tweezers to determine the effect of nucleotide analogs on the cycle. We find that ATP hydrolysis occurs sequentially during the burst and that ADP release is interlaced with ATP binding during the dwell, revealing a high degree of coordination among ring subunits. Moreover, we show that the motor displays an unexpected division of labor: although all subunits of the homopentamer bind and hydrolyze ATP during each cycle, only four participate in translocation, whereas the remaining subunit plays an ATP-dependent regulatory role."

https://openalex.org/W2013160679,"Functional links between neuronal activity and perception are studied by examining trial-by-trial correlations (choice probabilities) between neural responses and perceptual decisions. We addressed fundamental issues regarding the nature and origin of choice probabilities by recording from subcortical (brainstem and cerebellar) neurons in rhesus monkeys during a vestibular heading discrimination task. Subcortical neurons showed robust choice probabilities that exceeded those seen in cortex (area MSTd) under identical conditions. The greater choice probabilities of subcortical neurons could be predicted by a stronger dependence of correlated noise on tuning similarity, as revealed by population decoding. Significant choice probabilities were observed almost exclusively for neurons that responded selectively to translation, whereas neurons that represented net gravito-inertial acceleration did not show choice probabilities. These findings suggest that the emergence of choice probabilities in the vestibular system depends on a critical signal transformation that occurs in subcortical pathways to distinguish translation from orientation relative to gravity."

https://openalex.org/W2007653671,"TRIM11 (tripartite motif-containing protein 11), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is known to be involved in the development of the central nervous system. However, very little is known regarding the role of TRIM11 in cancer biology. Here, we examined the expression profile of TRIM11, along with two stem cell markers CD133 and nestin, in multiple glioma patient specimens, glioma primary cultures derived from tumors taken at surgery and normal neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs). The oncogenic function of TRIM11 in glioma biology was investigated by knockdown and/or overexpression in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our results showed that TRIM11 expression levels were upregulated in malignant glioma specimens and in high-grade glioma-derived primary cultures, whereas remaining low in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) stable cell lines, low-grade glioma-derived primary cultures and NSCs. The expression pattern of TRIM11 strongly correlated with that of CD133 and nestin and differentiation status of malignant glioma cells. Knock down of TRIM11 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of GBM cells, significantly decreased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, and downregulated HB-EGF (heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor) mRNA levels. Meanwhile, TRIM11 overexpression promoted a stem-like phenotype in vitro (tumorsphere formation) and enhanced glial tumor growth in immunocompromised mice. These findings suggest that TRIM11 might be an indicator of glioma malignancy and has an oncogenic function mediated through the EGFR signaling pathway. TRIM11 overexpression potentially leads to a more aggressive glioma phenotype, along with increased malignant tumor growth and poor survival. Taken together, clarification of the biological function of TRIM11 and pathways it affects may provide novel therapeutic strategies for treating malignant glioma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2113757912,"Leptin acts on its receptor (ObR) in the hypothalamus to inhibit food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin and ObR are also expressed in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the physiological significance of leptin signaling in the gut remains uncertain. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is a key negative feedback regulator of ObR-mediated signaling in the hypothalamus. We now show that gastrointestinal epithelial cell-specific SOCS3 conditional knockout (T3b-SOCS3 cKO) mice developed gastric tumors by enhancing leptin production and the ObRb/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. All T3b-SOCS3 cKO mice developed tumors in the stomach but not in the bowels by 2 months of age, even though the SOCS3 deletion occurred in both the epithelium of stomach and bowels. The tumors developed in the absence of the inflammatory response and all cKO mice died within 6 months. These tumors displayed pathology and molecular alterations, such as an increase in MUC2 (Mucin 2, oligomeric mucus/gel-forming) and TFF3 (trefoil factor 3), resembling human intestinal-type gastric tumors. Administration of antileptin antibody to T3b-SOCS3 cKO mice reduced hyperplasia of gastric mucosa, which is the step of the initiation of gastric tumor. These data suggest that SOCS3 is an antigastric tumor gene that suppresses leptin overexpression and ObRb/STAT3 hyperactivation, supporting the hypothesis that the leptin/ObRb/STAT3 axis accelerates tumorigenesis and that it may represent a new therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1999771675,"Adenoviruses are linear double-stranded DNA viruses that infect human and rodent cell lines, occasionally transform them and cause tumors in animal models. The host cell challenges the virus in multifaceted ways to restrain viral gene expression and DNA replication, and sometimes even eliminates the infected cells by programmed cell death. To combat these challenges, adenoviruses abrogate the cellular DNA damage response pathway. Tip60 is a lysine acetyltransferase that acetylates histones and other proteins to regulate gene expression, DNA damage response, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Tip60 is a bona fide tumor suppressor as mice that are haploid for Tip60 are predisposed to tumors. We have discovered that Tip60 is degraded by adenovirus oncoproteins EIB55K and E4orf6 by a proteasome-mediated pathway. Tip60 binds to the immediate early adenovirus promoter and suppresses adenovirus EIA gene expression, which is a master regulator of adenovirus transcription, at least partly through retention of the virally encoded repressor pVII on this promoter. Thus, degradation of Tip60 by the adenoviral early proteins is important for efficient viral early gene transcription and for changes in expression of cellular genes."
https://openalex.org/W2057834096,"ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) is an essential regulator of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism. For NER activation, ATR phosphorylates XPA, the rate-limiting factor in the NER pathway. However, the role of XPA phosphorylation at serine 196 by ATR has been elusive. Here we show that ATR-mediated XPA phosphorylation enhances XPA stability by inhibiting HERC2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. We analyzed stabilization of XPA with substitutions of Ser 196 either to aspartate (S196D), a phosphomimetic mutation, or to alanine (S196A), a phosphodeficient mutation. Upon ultraviolet damage, ATR facilitated HERC2 dissociation from the XPA complex to induce XPA stabilization. However, this regulation was abrogated in S196A-complemented XPA-deficient cells due to persistent association of HERC2 with this XPA complex, resulting in enhanced ubiquitination of S196A. Conversely, the S196D substitution showed delayed degradation kinetics compared with the wild-type and less binding with HERC2, resulting in reduced ubiquitination of S196D. We also found that XPA phosphorylation enhanced the chromatin retention of XPA, the interaction with its binding partners following DNA damage. Taken together, our study presents a novel control mechanism in the NER pathway by regulating the steady-state level of XPA through posttranslational modifications by which ATR-mediated phosphorylation induces XPA stabilization by antagonizing HERC2-catalyzed XPA ubiquitination."

https://openalex.org/W2067475896,"The regulation of mRNA deadenylation constitutes a pivotal mechanism of the post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Here we show that the antiproliferative protein Tob, a component of the Caf1–Ccr4 deadenylase complex, is involved in regulating the expression of the proto-oncogene c-myc. The c-myc mRNA contains cis elements (CPEs) in its 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR), which are recognized by the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB). CPEB recruits Caf1 deadenylase through interaction with Tob to form a ternary complex, CPEB–Tob–Caf1, and negatively regulates the expression of c-myc by accelerating the deadenylation and decay of its mRNA. In quiescent cells, c-myc mRNA is destabilized by the trans-acting complex (CPEB–Tob–Caf1), while in cells stimulated by the serum, both Tob and Caf1 are released from CPEB, and c-Myc expression is induced early after stimulation by the stabilization of its mRNA as an ‘immediate-early gene’. Collectively, these results indicate that Tob is a key factor in the regulation of c-myc gene expression, which is essential for cell growth. Thus, Tob appears to function in the control of cell growth at least, in part, by regulating the expression of c-myc."
https://openalex.org/W2019818831,"The MYC protooncogene is associated with the pathogenesis of most human neoplasia. Conversely, its experimental inactivation elicits oncogene addiction. Besides constituting a formidable therapeutic target, MYC also has an essential function in normal physiology, thus creating the need for context-specific targeting strategies. The analysis of post-translational MYC activity modulation yields novel targets for MYC inactivation. Specifically, following regulatory network analysis in human B-cells, we identify a novel role of the STK38 kinase as a regulator of MYC activity and a candidate target for abrogating tumorigenesis in MYC-addicted lymphoma. We found that STK38 regulates MYC protein stability and turnover in a kinase activity-dependent manner. STK38 kinase inactivation abrogates apoptosis following B-cell receptor activation, whereas its silencing significantly decreases MYC levels and increases apoptosis. Moreover, STK38 knockdown suppresses growth of MYC-addicted tumors in vivo, thus providing a novel viable target for treating these malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2117037255,"Neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex has been linked to flexible representations of stimulus-outcome associations. Such value representations are known to emerge with learning, but the neural mechanisms supporting this phenomenon are not well understood. Here, we provide evidence for a causal role for NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in mediating spike pattern discriminability, neural plasticity, and rhythmic synchronization in relation to evaluative stimulus processing and decision making. Using tetrodes, single-unit spike trains and local field potentials were recorded during local, unilateral perfusion of an NMDAR blocker in rat OFC. In the absence of behavioral effects, NMDAR blockade severely hampered outcome-selective spike pattern formation to olfactory cues, relative to control perfusions. Moreover, NMDAR blockade shifted local rhythmic synchronization to higher frequencies and degraded its linkage to stimulus-outcome selective coding. These results demonstrate the importance of NMDARs for cue-outcome associative coding in OFC during learning and illustrate how NMDAR blockade disrupts network dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2044629154,"Checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) kinase is a key mediator in many cellular responses to genotoxic stresses, including ionizing radiation (IR) and topoisomerase inhibitors. Upon IR, CHK2 is activated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase and regulates the S-phase and G1-S checkpoints, apoptosis and DNA repair by phosphorylating downstream target proteins, such as p53 and Brca1. In addition, CHK2 is thought to be a multi-organ cancer susceptibility gene. In this study, we used a tandem affinity purification strategy to identify proteins that interact with CHK2 kinase. Cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11)p110 kinase, implicated in pre-mRNA splicing and transcription, was identified as a CHK2-interacting protein. CHK2 kinase phosphorylated CDK11p110 on serine 737 in vitro. Unexpectedly, CHK2 kinase constitutively phosphorylated CDK11p110 in a DNA damage-independent manner. At a molecular level, CDK11p110 phosphorylation was required for homodimerization without affecting its kinase activity. Overexpression of CHK2 promoted pre-mRNA splicing. Conversely, CHK2 depletion decreased endogenous splicing activity. Mutation of the phosphorylation site in CDK11p110 to alanine abrogated its splicing-activating activity. These results provide the first evidence that CHK2 kinase promotes pre-mRNA splicing via phosphorylating CDK11p110."
https://openalex.org/W2117285356,"Phage G1 gp67 is a 23 kDa protein that binds to the Staphylococcus aureus (Sau) RNA polymerase (RNAP) σ(A) subunit and blocks cell growth by inhibiting transcription. We show that gp67 has little to no effect on transcription from most promoters but is a potent inhibitor of ribosomal RNA transcription. A 2.0-Å-resolution crystal structure of the complex between gp67 and Sau σ(A) domain 4 (σ(A)(4)) explains how gp67 joins the RNAP promoter complex through σ(A)(4) without significantly affecting σ(A)(4) function. Our results indicate that gp67 forms a complex with RNAP at most, if not all, σ(A)-dependent promoters, but selectively inhibits promoters that depend on an interaction between upstream DNA and the RNAP α-subunit C-terminal domain (αCTD). Thus, we reveal a promoter-specific transcription inhibition mechanism by which gp67 interacts with the RNAP promoter complex through one subunit (σ(A)), and selectively affects the function of another subunit (αCTD) depending on promoter usage."
https://openalex.org/W2049224371,"D-Xylulokinase (XK; EC 2.7.1.17) catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of d-xylulose (Xu) to produce xylulose 5-phosphate (Xu5P). In mammals, XK is the last enzyme in the glucuronate-xylulose pathway, active in the liver and kidneys, and is linked through its product Xu5P to the pentose-phosphate pathway. XK may play an important role in metabolic disease, given that Xu5P is a key regulator of glucose metabolism and lipogenesis. We have expressed the product of a putative human XK gene and identified it as the authentic human d-xylulokinase (hXK). NMR studies with a variety of sugars showed that hXK acts only on d-xylulose, and a coupled photometric assay established its key kinetic parameters as K(m)(Xu) = 24 ± 3 μm and k(cat) = 35 ± 5 s(-1). Crystal structures were determined for hXK, on its own and in complexes with Xu, ADP, and a fluorinated inhibitor. These reveal that hXK has a two-domain fold characteristic of the sugar kinase/hsp70/actin superfamily, with glycerol kinase as its closest relative. Xu binds to domain-I and ADP to domain-II, but in this open form of hXK they are 10 Å apart, implying that a large scale conformational change is required for catalysis. Xu binds in its linear keto-form, sandwiched between a Trp side chain and polar side chains that provide exquisite hydrogen bonding recognition. The hXK structure provides a basis for the design of specific inhibitors with which to probe its roles in sugar metabolism and metabolic disease."

Although an increase in the level of diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) has been detected in nuclei, there is a paucity of data on how these nuclear messengers regulate nuclear processes, and for some of them, like InsP3, there is no proof that they play the same role in regulation of calcium levels as the classical one at the cell membrane (9Irvine R.F. Nuclear lipid signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Major progress in understanding the possible functional role of the pathway has been recently made by genetic and biochemical studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Phospholipid signaling in yeast shares many similarities with endonuclear phosphoinositide signaling in mammals; yeasts have enzymes to generate nuclear PtdInsP2, and they have Plc1 encoded by a PLC1, which is a homolog of the mammalian Plc-δ1, but they lack important elements of the “classical” phosphoinositide signaling because they have no InsP3 receptor in their genome and do not utilize diacylglycerol to activate protein kinase C. However, yeast uses InsP3 as a precursor for the synthesis of higher inositol phosphates and pyrophosphates, and these products have been proven to regulate several important nuclear events (10Tsui M.M. York J.D. Roles of inositol phosphates and inositol pyrophosphates in development, cell signaling and nuclear processes.Adv. Enzyme Reg. 2010; 50: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In yeast models, the possible role of higher inositol phosphates in the progression through the cell cycle has not been investigated, but the association of Plc1 with kinetochore has been found to be important for proper chromosome segregation and cell cycle progression (11Lin H.

In S. cerevisiae, inositol phosphates and pyrophosphates are generated by complex action of four different kinases, as shown in Fig. 1. Ins(1,4,5)P3 is first phosphorylated by dual specificity InsP3/InsP4 6-/3-kinase Ipk2 into Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 (InsP4) and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (InsP5), and Ipk1 then phosphorylates Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 into Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)P6. The synthesis of diphosphoinositol phosphates or pyrophosphates in yeast is mediated by two kinases: Kcs1 phosphorylates InsP5 into 5-PP-InsP4 and phosphorylates InsP6 into 5-PP-InsP5 (InsP7); Vip1 phosphorylates InsP6 into InsP7 isomer 1-PP-InsP5. (PP)2-InsP4 (InsP8) is generated by either Kcs1-mediated phosphorylation of 1-PP-InsP5 or Vip1-mediated phosphorylation of 5-PP-InsP5. The majority of enzymes responsible for synthesis of inositol phosphates can be found in the nucleus, and all of them have been reported to have some role in nuclear processes (10Tsui M.M. York J.D.

In this study, we investigated changes in inositol phosphate levels in α-factor-treated S. cerevisiae, which allows cells to progress synchronously through the cell cycle after release from the G1 block. The results of this study show an increase in the activity of Plc1 early after release from the block with a concomitant increase in the level of InsP7 and InsP8. The increase in the level of inositol pyrophosphates was found to be due to the activation of Kcs1, which is necessary for the progression of the cells through the S phase of the cell cycle. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: all media and supplements for yeast growth from Formedium; α-factor mating pheromone from Zymo Research; U73122 from Calbiochem; glass beads (diameter 425–600 μm), RNase A, proteinase K, bovine brain extract (Type I, Folsch fraction V), InsP6, and PtdInsP2 from Sigma; [3H]PtdInsP2 (20 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; [3H]inositol (30 Ci/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences or American Radiolabeled Chemicals; Calmodulin-Sepharose 4B from Amersham Biosciences; InsP5 from Cell Signaling; and Sytox from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are isogenic with W303 MATa (leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, ura3-1, ade2-1, trp1-1, rad5-535, can1-100). Deletion strains ddp1::HIS3, kcs1::HIS3, plc1::KANMX were generated as described previously (16York S.J. Armbruster B.N. Greenwell P. Petes T.D. York J.D.

For labeling experiments, cells were inoculated in synthetic medium without inositol with the addition of 5.7 mg/ml ammonium sulfate, 0.82 mg/ml amino acids, 2% glucose, and 5 μCi/ml [3H]inositol (labeling medium) and grown to achieve isotopic equilibrium (8–9 divisions) in a shaker incubator at 30 °C and 200 rpm (20Azevedo C. Saiardi A. Extraction and analysis of soluble inositol polyphosphates from yeast.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2416-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At the end of incubation, cells were collected, counted, resuspended in fresh labeling medium at a concentration of 2.5 × 106/ml, grown into mid-logarithmic phase, and then incubated in the presence of 5 μm α-factor mating pheromone for 6 h (WT and ddp1Δ) or 24 h (kcs1Δ and plc1Δ). The G1-arrested cells were washed twice with synthetic medium lacking inositol, released into fresh labeling medium, and allowed to progress synchronously through the cell cycle. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested by centrifugation (2,000 × g, 4 °C, 4 min). For flow cytometric analysis, cells were grown as described above, except that cold inositol was added into the medium at the same concentration as [3H]inositol. At the indicated time points, 1 ml of cell suspension was harvested, fixed with 9 ml of 90% ethanol, and stored at −20 °C. For phosphoinositide analysis, the pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of 2:1 (v/v) methanol/water containing 0.08 m HCl, 6.7 mm Na2HPO4, 0.83 mm EDTA, and 0.83 mm EGTA and vortexed for 30 s. Acid-washed glass beads (0.8-g diameter, 425–600 μm) were added, and the slurry was alternately vortexed (30 s) and cooled on ice (30 s) through 10 cycles. Afterward, 0.47 ml of methanol (containing 0.12 m HCl) and 1.33 ml of chloroform were added, the slurry was vortexed (30 s), and the monophasic mixture was left on ice (15 min). Bovine brain phosphoinositides (10 μg, Type I, Folsch fraction V) were added in 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol, and samples were vortexed (30 s) and cooled on ice. After adding 0.4 ml of a mixture of 0.1 m HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4, 5 mm tetra-n-butyl-ammonium hydrogen sulfate, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm EGTA, mixing yielded a two-phase system (separated at 3,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) (18Perera N.M.

The chloroform-rich lower phase was transferred to a glass vial and dried in vacuo by roto-evaporation, and excess HCl was removed by repeated drying in vacuo with methanol. Lipids were deacylated (monomethylamine reagent, 53 °C, 50 min), and the separation of all of the glycerophosphoinositides was achieved using an HPLC high resolution 5 μm Partisphere SAX column (Whatman) with a discontinuous gradient up to 1 m (NH4)2HPO4 × H3PO4 (pH 3.8) exactly as described in a previous study (19Sindić A. Aleksandrova A. Fields A.P. Volinia S. Banfić H. Presence and activation of nuclear phosphoinositide 3-kinase C2β during compensatory liver growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17754-17761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For inositol polyphosphate analysis, the pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of extraction buffer (1 m HClO4, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml InsP6), glass beads were added, and cells were disrupted by vortexing, as described above. After centrifugation for 1 min in a microcentrifuge, the soluble extract was transferred to a new tube, 0.2 ml of neutralization buffer (1 m K2CO3 and 3 mm EDTA) was added to achieve pH 6–8, neutralization was allowed overnight at 4 °C, the final volume was adjusted to 0.5 ml, and samples were filtered using Spin-X microcentrifuge tubes and stored for HPLC analysis. Separation of all the inositol phosphates was achieved using a high resolution 5 μm Partisphere SAX column (Whatman) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, with a gradient generated by mixing buffers A (1 mm EDTA) and B 1.3 m (NH4)2HPO4 × H3PO4 (pH 3.8) as follows: 0–10 min, 0% buffer B; 10–75 min, 0–100% buffer B; 75–85 min, 100% buffer B using the Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex) (20Azevedo C. Saiardi A. Extraction and analysis of soluble inositol polyphosphates from yeast.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2416-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a synthetic medium with cold inositol, synchronized, and harvested as described above. Pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.3 m mannitol, 0.1 m KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and cells were disrupted, as described above. The homogenate was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 90,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 27 rotor. Plc activity was measured as described by Crljen et al. (8Crljen V. Visnjić D. Banfić H. Presence of different phospholipase C isoforms in the nucleus and their activation during compensatory liver growth.FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 100 μg of protein were incubated in 0.2 ml of assay buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm, HEPES (pH 7.0), 200 μm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm PtdInsP2) and 50,000 cpm of [3H]PtdInsP2/assay. After 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), followed by 0.25 ml of 2.4 n HCl. After a brief centrifugation, the top phase was removed, and the amount of InsP3 was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. [32P]InsP6 was produced enzymatically in 0.3 ml of buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl and 10 mm MgCl2) with 30 μl of [γ-32P]ATP, 45 μl of GST-atIpk1 (1 mg/ml), and 15 μl of InsP5 (100 μm). The reaction was run at 37 °C for 60 min, the enzyme was added once again after 30 min, and the enzyme was subsequently heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 10 min (21Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. A conserved family of enzymes that phosphorylate inositol hexakisphosphate.Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Yeast Kcs1-TAP cells were grown in a synthetic medium and synchronized as described above. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested and disrupted using glass beads in 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Calmodulin-Sepharose 4B (10 μl) was added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed twice with binding buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and then twice with 100 mm NaCl (22Onnebo S.M. Saiardi A. Inositol pyrophosphates modulate hydrogen peroxide signalling.Biochem. J. 2009; 423: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The resin was then used to perform an InsP6 kinase assay using 50,000 cpm/assay of [32P]InsP6 in 20 μl of assay buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP and 1 μm InsP6). The reaction was run for 30 min at 37 °C and terminated by adding 1 μl of 1 m HCl and placing on ice. After centrifugation for 1 min in a microcentrifuge, 5 μl of reaction mixture was spotted onto PEI-TLC plates and developed in a tank equilibrated with buffer containing 1.09 m KH2PO4, 0.72 m K2HPO4, 2.07 m HCl (21Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. A conserved family of enzymes that phosphorylate inositol hexakisphosphate.Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). After autoradiography, spots corresponding to InsP6 and InsP7 were scraped and counted for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. Cells were washed by 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.4; sonicated; incubated in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 mg/ml of RNase A at 50 °C for 1 h; and then treated with 1 mg/ml of proteinase K at 50 °C for 1 h, washed, and resuspended in 50 mm sodium citrate containing 1 μm Sytox. The DNA fluorescence analyses were performed on at least 10,000 cells for each sample with the FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using CellQuest and ModFit software (BD Biosciences). The data are shown as means ± S.E. For statistical analysis, Student's t test for unpaired samples at a level of significance of 0.05 was used. Yeast cells were grown in synthetic medium containing 0.2 μm inositol with an average cell doubling time of 3 h. To allow synchronous progression through the cell cycle, logarithmically growing cells were first incubated in the presence of α-factor for 6 h and then washed and released into fresh medium. An aliquot of cells was harvested at the indicated times, stained with Sytox, and analyzed by FACS. As shown in Fig. 2A, G1-arrested cells returned to a cycling state with the majority of cells completing S phase within 2 h after reseeding. To test for the possible de novo synthesis of inositol phospholipids and phosphates, a pulse experiment was performed by adding fresh medium containing 3H-labeled inositol to logarithmically growing cells or cells that were washed and released from α-factor block. The results demonstrated a significant increase in the incorporation of radiolabel into both PtdInsP2 (Fig. 2B) and InsP6 (Fig. 2C) 30–120 min after release from the block. To further test for possible changes in the level of inositol phospholipids and phosphates, yeast cells were first cultured for 8–9 cell divisions in medium containing [3H]inositol and then synchronized by G1 arrest, released into fresh labeling medium, and allowed to progress synchronously through the cell cycle. Comparison of HPLC elution profiles of inositol phosphates at times 0 (Fig. 3A) and 30 min after release from the block (Fig. 3B) indicated an increase in the level of InsP3, a decrease in the level of InsP6 (not shown), an increase in two peaks eluted after InsP6 that corresponded to InsP7 and InsP8, and no changes in the level of InsP4 and InsP5. Time course analysis of the level of InsP3 in synchronized cells revealed a significant increase in the level as early as 15 min after the release from the block, the peak level was measured at 30 min, and the level returned to the basal level in G1-arrested cells at 90 min after release (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3D, time course analysis of the level of PtdInsP2 mirrored the changes in the level of InsP3, and both changes corresponded well with the time-dependent increase in the activity of Plc1 when measured in an assay that uses exogenous [3H]PtdInsP2 as a substrate (Fig. 3E). To confirm that observed changes in the level of PtdInsP2 and inositol phosphates were initiated by an increase in the activity of Plc1, labeled cells were synchronized in G1 with α-factor, washed, and released into fresh medium containing the commercially available Plc inhibitor U73122. Comparison of HPLC elution profiles of inositol phosphates at times 0 (Fig. 4A) and 30 min after release from the block in the presence of U73122 (Fig. 4B) confirmed that the presence of Plc inhibitor completely abolished all peaks eluted, except for the peak corresponding to InsP6. Furthermore, the presence of Plc inhibitor prevented time-dependent changes in the level of PtdInsP2 (results not shown); decreased the level of InsP3 (Fig. 4C), InsP7 (Fig. 4E), and InsP8 (Fig. 4F) as early as 15 min after release; and completely abolished the peaks at 30–120 min. Regarding InsP6, the time course analysis showed that the presence of U73122 caused a progressive decline in the level of InsP6, which reached zero at 120 min after release (Fig. 4D). It is important to note that 10 μm U73122 completely inhibited activity of Plc1 when assayed using exogenous [3H]PtdInsP2 as a substrate (results not shown). To test for the role of Plc1 activation in the progression through the cell cycle, FACS analysis was performed on wild type cells arrested by α-factor and released into medium in the presence of U73122 or vehicle (control). As shown in Fig. 5, the presence of Plc inhibitor completely prevented the progression through the S phase. A similar block in the progression through the cell cycle was observed in plc1Δ mutants, in which no inositol phosphates could be detected by HPLC (results not shown). Time-dependent changes in the level of inositol phosphates were further investigated. As shown in Fig. 6, the time-dependent decrease in the levels of InsP6 (Fig. 6A) was mirrored by an increase in the level of both InsP7 (Fig. 6B) and InsP8 (Fig. 6C). In S. cerevisiae, Kcs1 is one of the two kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of InsP6 and generation of pyrophosphates (10Tsui M.M. York J.D. Roles of inositol phosphates and inositol pyrophosphates in development, cell signaling and nuclear processes.Adv. Enzyme Reg. 2010; 50: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To test whether an increase in the level of InsP7 and InsP8 was due to the activity of Kcs1, endogenous Kcs1-TAP was purified from yeast cells harvested at different time points after release from the block and assayed for its ability to phosphorylate exogenous [32P]InsP6. As shown in Fig. 6D, an increase in the activity of Kcs1 in vitro paralleled the observed changes in the level of pyrophosphates. The labeling experiments of the present study were performed by using synthetic medium containing only radiolabeled inositol (5 μCi/ml), which results in a final concentration of inositol (0.2 μm) that is significantly lower than the 11 μm inositol concentration in complete standard synthetic medium. To rule out the possibility that the observed changes in the level of inositol phosphates were influenced by a lack of inositol in labeling medium, two additional sets of experiments were performed using different labeling protocols. First, cells were labeled using synthetic medium containing only radiolabeled inositol, but at a concentration (50 μCi/ml [3H]inositol) that increases the final concentration to 2 μm. In a second protocol, cells were labeled using standard synthetic complete medium (containing 11 μm unlabeled inositol) that was supplemented with 10 μCi/ml [3H]inositol, which results in a total inositol concentration of 11.4 μm (16York S.J. Armbruster B.N. Greenwell P. Petes T.D. York J.D. Inositol diphosphate signaling regulates telomere length.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4264-4269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Again, labeled cells were arrested with α-factor, released into fresh labeling medium, and allowed to progress synchronously through the cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 7, the time course changes in the levels of InsP3, InsP6, InsP7, and InsP8 for both labeling protocols follow a similar pattern when compared with time course changes of the level of inositol phosphates extracted from the cells that were labeled using synthetic medium containing only 5 μCi/ml [3H]inositol (Figs. 3C and 6, A–C). Furthermore, the proportion of radioactivity in each of the inositol phosphates, for each time point, using different labeling protocols is similar (1:4.3:0.6). Similar to results obtained using labeling medium containing 5 μCi/ml [3H]inositol (Fig. 3, A and B), no time-dependent changes in"

https://openalex.org/W2061198525,"To examine the role of telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) in epithelial tumorigenesis, we characterized conditional loss of TRF2 expression in the basal layer of mouse epidermis. These mice exhibit some characteristics of dyskeratosis congenita, a human stem cell depletion syndrome caused by telomere dysfunction. The epidermis in conditional TRF2 null mice exhibited DNA damage response and apoptosis, which correlated with stem cell depletion. The stem cell population in conditional TRF2 null epidermis exhibited shorter telomeres than those in control mice. Squamous cell carcinomas induced in conditional TRF2 null mice developed with increased latency and slower growth due to reduced numbers of proliferating cells as the result of increased apoptosis. TRF2 null epidermal stem cells were found in both primary and metastatic tumors. Despite the low-grade phenotype of the conditional TRF2 null primary tumors, the number of metastatic lesions was similar to control cancers. Basal cells from TRF2 null tumors demonstrated extreme telomere shortening and dramatically increased numbers of telomeric signals by fluorescence in situ hybridization due to increased genomic instability and aneuploidy in these cancers. DNA damage response signals were detected at telomeres in TRF2 null tumor cells from these mice. The increased genomic instability in these tumors correlated with eightfold expansion of the transformed stem cell population compared with that in control cancers. We concluded that genomic instability resulting from loss of TRF2 expression provides biological advantages to the cancer stem cell population."
