https://openalex.org/W186117563,"It has been shown that the poky strain of Neurospora is deficient in some
components of the cytochrome system and that respiration in this organism
utilizes a different pathway for terminal oxidation (1, 2). Besides poky,
three other Neurospora strains have been discovered (3) which are of considerable
interest with regard to their cytochromes and their respiratory
activities: (1) mi-3 which contains a high concentration of cytochrome c,
rather less cytochrome b, and seems to be devoid of cytochrome a; (2)
C115 with an equally high cytochrome c concentration, little cytochrome
b, and hardly detectable cytochrome a; (3) C117 which, in addition to a
strong cytochrome b band, shows the sharp band of cytochrome e at 552
to 553 ÂµM but does not show any cytochrome c or a bands.
The characteristics of mi-3, like those of poky, are inherited cytoplasmically,
while the characteristics of C115 and C117 are inherited in a
Mendelian fashion. This paper is concerned with a description of the
cytochromes and the respiratory characteristics of these new strains."

A rapid shift of electrons to or from the Mg atom is greatly facilitated by the many resonance forms (in the ordinary chemical sense) of which the conjugated bond system is capable, and it may be supposed that these factors, too, are important in photosynthesis."
