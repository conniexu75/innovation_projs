https://openalex.org/W1990192893,"Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS) is an autosomal dominant circadian rhythm variant; affected individuals are ""morning larks"" with a 4-hour advance of the sleep, temperature, and melatonin rhythms. Here we report localization of the FASPS gene near the telomere of chromosome 2q. A strong candidate gene (hPer2), a human homolog of the period gene in Drosophila, maps to the same locus. Affected individuals have a serine to glycine mutation within the casein kinase Iepsilon (CKIepsilon) binding region of hPER2, which causes hypophosphorylation by CKIepsilon in vitro. Thus, a variant in human sleep behavior can be attributed to a missense mutation in a clock component, hPER2, which alters the circadian period."

https://openalex.org/W2161558954,"Crystal nucleation is a much-studied phenomenon, yet the rate at which it occurs remains difficult to predict. Small crystal nuclei form spontaneously in supersaturated solutions, but unless their size exceeds a critical value--the so-called critical nucleus--they will re-dissolve rather than grow. It is this rate-limiting step that has proved difficult to probe experimentally. The crystal nucleation rate depends on Pcrit, the (very small) probability that a critical nucleus forms spontaneously, and on a kinetic factor (kappa) that measures the rate at which critical nuclei subsequently grow. Given the absence of a priori knowledge of either quantity, classical nucleation theory is commonly used to analyse crystal nucleation experiments, with the unconstrained parameters adjusted to fit the observations. This approach yields no 'first principles' prediction of absolute nucleation rates. Here we approach the problem from a different angle, simulating the nucleation process in a suspension of hard colloidal spheres, to obtain quantitative numerical predictions of the crystal nucleation rate. We find large discrepancies between the computed nucleation rates and those deduced from experiments: the best experimental estimates of Pcrit seem to be too large by several orders of magnitude."

https://openalex.org/W3099244134,"The motion of fluid particles as they are pushed along erratic trajectories by fluctuating pressure gradients is fundamental to transport and mixing in turbulence. It is essential in cloud formation and atmospheric transport, processes in stirred chemical reactors and combustion systems, and in the industrial production of nanoparticles. The concept of particle trajectories has been used successfully to describe mixing and transport in turbulence, but issues of fundamental importance remain unresolved. One such issue is the Heisenberg-Yaglom prediction of fluid particle accelerations, based on the 1941 scaling theory of Kolmogorov. Here we report acceleration measurements using a detector adapted from high-energy physics to track particles in a laboratory water flow at Reynolds numbers up to 63,000. We find that, within experimental errors, Kolmogorov scaling of the acceleration variance is attained at high Reynolds numbers. Our data indicate that the acceleration is an extremely intermittent variable--particles are observed with accelerations of up to 1,500 times the acceleration of gravity (equivalent to 40 times the root mean square acceleration). We find that the acceleration data reflect the anisotropy of the large-scale flow at all Reynolds numbers studied."

https://openalex.org/W2159689824,"We demonstrate a decoherence-free quantum memory of one qubit. By encoding the qubit into the decoherence-free subspace (DFS) of a pair of trapped 9 Be + ions, we protect the qubit from environment-induced dephasing that limits the storage time of a qubit composed of a single ion. We measured the storage time under ambient conditions and under interaction with an engineered noisy environment and observed that encoding into the DFS increases the storage time by up to an order of magnitude. The encoding reversibly transfers an arbitrary qubit stored in a single ion to the DFS of two ions."

https://openalex.org/W1589004185,"With the reports of the DNA sequence of the human and mouse genomes, research attention is now on questions of protein function and interactions, developmental and physiological pathways, and systems biology. The International Mouse Mutagenesis Consortium proposes goals and outlines plans for the next 10 years for annotating the mouse genome and compiling data on mouse mutations. In addition to the challenges of identifying new assays to probe biological functions, more efficient and reliable methods are needed for archiving, managing, analyzing, displaying, and disseminating the complex phenotype data sets resulting from mutagenesis programs. Achieving these goals will require the biomedical research community to improve efficiencies, to reduce costs, and to coordinate international expertise and resources."

https://openalex.org/W2047754542,"A star forms when a cloud of dust and gas collapses. It is generally believed that this collapse first produces a flattened rotating disk1,2, through which matter is fed onto the embryonic star at the centre of the disk. When the temperature and density at the centre of the star pass a critical threshold, thermonuclear fusion begins. The remaining disk, which can still contain up to 0.3 times the mass of the star3,4,5, is then sculpted and eventually dissipated by the radiation and wind from the newborn star. But this picture of the structure and evolution of the disk remains speculative because of the lack of morphological data of sufficient resolution and uncertainties regarding the underlying physical processes. Here we present images of a young star, LkHα101, in which the structure of the inner accretion disk is resolved. We find that the disk is almost face-on, with a central gap (or cavity) and a hot inner edge. The cavity is bigger than previous theoretical predictions6, and we infer that the position of the inner edge is probably determined by sublimation of dust grains by direct stellar radiation, rather than by disk-reprocessing or viscous-heating processes as usually assumed29."

Here we investigate the effects of inhaling particles emitted from the combustion of this mixture and find that these cause significantly more lung damage in mice than do particles from coal alone, probably because of their zinc content. Our findings indicate that the use of dried municipal sewage sludge as a 'green' (CO2-neutral) replacement fuel should be considered with caution."

One of the most difficult issues is determining the proper balance between privacy concerns and fair use of genetic information. Although U.S. federal law does provide some protection against discrimination in health insurance, but continued scrutiny is needed. Policies protecting confidentiality in employment, research, and genetic testing (particularly in the reproductive sciences) should be considered and, if necessary, put into federal law. Eventually every country must decide what genetic information should be protected, who will have access to it, and how it may be used.
