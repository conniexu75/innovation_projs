https://openalex.org/W2028266538,"Static pressure apparatus has been developed which is capable of pressures up to 200 kbar and transient temperatures up to about 5000°K, using an electric flash‐heating technique. At pressures above about 125 kbar and temperatures in the 3000°K range it is found that graphite spontaneously collapses completely to polycrystalline diamond which may be retrieved quantitatively. The threshold temperature of the transformation is several hundred degrees lower than the melting temperature of graphite. The diamond/graphite/liquid triple point is found to be located at about 125 (+10, —0) kbar and 4100 (±200)°K. The shock compression results of DeCarli and Jamieson, and of Alder and Christian, are linked with the present results to construct a phase diagram of carbon extending to 5000°K and 800 kbar."

https://openalex.org/W2088388798,"The sex attractant of the female American cockroach, Periplaneta americana (L.), has been collected and isolated by a combination of extraction, distillation, and chromatographic procedures. Progress through these procedures has been followed by bioassay and by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The attractant has been isolated by gas chromatography, and characterization by mass spectrometry is proceeding."

https://openalex.org/W2045148175,"The logarithm of the amount of oxygen consumed per unit swimming velocity in meters per minute for steadily swimming antarctic fishes at freezing temperatures is of the same order as the rate for temperate species at their lower temperature ranges. In contrast to temperate fishes, the antarctic fishes have their greatest swimming activity around -1.8°C and a level of no excess activity at about +2°C."

https://openalex.org/W2016823464,"Preliminary numerical integrations of the lunar motion indicate that defects in the lunar ephemeris, due to omissions in the revised Brown lunar theory, produce errors of the order of several hundred meters in the coordinates at certain times. Such errors are large enough to affect adversely analyses of data from spacecraft, as well as determination of ephemeris time. Distinct planetary periodicities seem to appear in the residuals."
https://openalex.org/W2050921056,The origin of natural hybrids of the plant Baptisia was determined by chromatographic analyses of leaf extracts of both hybrid and parent plants. This method demonstrated a pattern of inheritance in the hybrid of certain species specific components of both parents.

https://openalex.org/W1972435511,"When range and Doppler observations of space probes near or on Moon are reduced by use of a lunar ephemeris calculated from the Brown lunar theory, residuals as large as 440 meters in position and 1.5 millimeters per second in velocity are observed. When the calculations are repeated with use of LE 5, the integrated lunar ephemeris described, the residuals are greatly reduced."

https://openalex.org/W1981995138,"A meteorite, a single stone weighing 230 grams, was discovered in the roof of a warehouse on 17 July 1967; evidently it fell during the preceding week. The warehouse is on the northeast edge of Denver, Colorado; coordinates, 39 degrees 46'57''N, 104 degrees 55'50''W. This is the first recovered fresh fall in the United States since the Bells (Texas) meteorite of 9 September 1961. The composition and structure are those of an olivine-hypersthene chondrite."

https://openalex.org/W2166531757,"Precise measurements of the Doppler shift of radar waves reflected from Moon disclose unexpectedly large discrepancies-averaging about 0.6 centimeter per second-between the radial velocities and the predictions based on the Eckert-Brown lunar ephemeris. These residuals have a rapidly changing component corresponding to a relatively large, variable, and unexplained discrepancy in radial acceleration of about 10(-4) centimeter per second, per second, in magnitude and about 1 day in period."
