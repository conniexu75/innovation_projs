https://openalex.org/W2065104935,"Substrate RNAs are only efficiently spliced in HeLa whole-cell extract when they possess capped 5' termini. This cap requirement is observed with substrate RNAs prepared by transcription with either mammalian RNA polymerase II or bacterial RNA polymerase. Addition of less than 10 microM of cap analogs such as m7G(5')ppp(5')N or m7GTP strongly inhibits splicing of capped RNAs. This observation, as well as experiments following the fate of substrate RNA, indicates that the dependence of splicing on a cap structure is not due to an effect on RNA stability. More interestingly, cap analogs inhibit splicing when added at the start of the reaction but not at later times of incubation. This suggests that the cap recognition might be an important step in the formation of a specific ribonucleoprotein complex required for splicing."

In experiments in which wound healing chambers were implanted subcutaneously in the backs of rats, these bovine transforming growth factors accelerated the accumulation of total protein, collagen, and DNA in treated chambers. These studies thus show an effect of an isolated transforming growth factor in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1981412858,"The gene for rat pancreatic elastase I is selectively expressed to high levels in the rat exocrine pancreas. When the cloned rat elastase I gene with 7 kb upstream and 5 kb downstream flanking sequences was introduced into mice by microinjection into fertilized eggs, the gene was expressed in a pancreas-specific manner. In four of five transgenic mice, the level of rat elastase I mRNA in the pancreas was equal to or greater than the normal rat level (10,000 mRNAs per cell) and correlated with the number of integrated gene copies. In nonpancreatic tissues the levels were at least 10(3)-fold lower, except for expression in the liver of one mouse. Thus transfer of a 23 kb genomic DNA segment containing the rat elastase I gene to a foreign chromosomal location in the mouse can give rise to qualitatively and quantitatively normal expression."
https://openalex.org/W1594736139,"Previous studies have identified several cellular requirements for mevalonic acid that appear unrelated to cholesterol, dolichol, or ubiquinone. To search for other products of mevalonic acid that might account for these requirements we cultured Swiss 3T3 cells in the presence of mevinolin, an inhibitor of mevalonic acid biosynthesis, then labeled the cells with exogenous radioactive mevalonic acid. Upon analyzing the radioactive material formed, we found that 40-50% of it was not extractable into lipid solvents, and that most of the lipid-insoluble material behaved like protein when treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate:chloroform:phenol, RNase, or proteinase K. Further analysis by electrophoresis revealed that radioactivity was associated with a few specific proteins that had apparent molecular weights of 13,000-58,000. Control experiments indicated that authentic radioactive (R)-mevalonic acid was the active precursor. Other lines of evidence suggested that mevalonate was first converted to an isoprenoid compound, then covalently incorporated into proteins by way of a cycloheximide-insensitive mechanism. These results suggest that Swiss 3T3 cells possess novel metabolic products of mevalonic acid metabolism that are formed by post-translational incorporation of isoprenoids into specific cell proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2056033371,"We have introduced a hybrid mouse-human β-globin gene as well as the intact human β-globin gene into murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and have demonstrated that these genes are appropriately regulated during differentiation of the MEL cell in culture. The addition of chemical inducers to co-transformed cells results in a 5 to 50 fold increase in the level of mRNA transcribed from the exogenous globin gene. S1 nuclease and primer extension analyses demonstrate that these mRNAs initiate and terminate correctly. Nuclear transcription experiments indicate that induction of hybrid mRNA results at least in part from the increase in the rate of globin gene transcription. Furthermore, the induction appears to be specific for globin genes within an erythroid cell. These results permit the study of expression of the globin gene during erythroid differentiation and suggest that the specific induction of the globin gene is an inherent property of DNA sequences within or flanking the β-globin genes. Moreover, the fact that the human and hybrid globin genes are both inducible in MEL cells suggests that these regulatory sequences are conserved between mouse and human cells."

It is now possible to attempt to modify many different properties of proteins by combining information on crystal structure and protein chemistry with artificial gene synthesis. Such techniques offer the potential for altering protein structure and function in ways not possible by any other method."

https://openalex.org/W1592550302,"Casein kinase G purified from bovine tissue is an oligomeric cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase made of two different monomers, namely an alpha (Mr = 38 kilodaltons) and a self-phosphorylatable beta (Mr = 27 kilodaltons) subunit. Treatment of the native enzyme under denaturing conditions (0.5 M NaCl, 4 M LiCl, and 20 to 35% formamide) resulted in a progressive selective removal of the beta subunit following gel filtration and a correlated loss of activity of the corresponding renatured enzyme. Mild digestion with papain resulted in a proteolytic alteration limited to the beta monomer with a concomitant partial loss of the enzyme activity. Isolation of the alpha and beta casein kinase G subunits was achieved by preparative reversed polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Renaturation of the proteins following sodium dodecyl sulfate removal by acetone and/or Triton X-100 treatment allowed reconstitution of a functional casein kinase G. Whereas the isolated alpha subunit was found to exhibit a weak catalytic activity, addition of the beta subunit was required for recovery of a maximal casein kinase activity. The process was dose-dependent and reached a plateau for an alpha:beta subunit molar ratio of approximately 1 to 1. These data suggest that while the casein kinase G alpha subunit bears the catalytic site, stoichiometric combination with the beta subunit is required for optimal enzymatic activity. A possible role of the beta subunit as a regulatory component of casein kinase G activity in the intact cell remains to be examined."
https://openalex.org/W1596621116,"Protein kinases associated with the transforming proteins of a number of retroviruses are specific for tyrosine. Several proteins in cells transformed by these viruses are phosphorylated at tyrosine. We have now identified three unrelated abundant nonphosphorylated cellular proteins of 46,000, 39,000 and 28,000 daltons in chick embryo cells, which are the unphosphorylated forms of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and thus are substrates for tyrosine protein kinases. By two-dimensional gel analysis, we have found that the 46,000-dalton protein exists in two unphosphorylated forms of which the more acidic is a minor species. This latter form is phosphorylated, chiefly at serine, in both normal and transformed cells, generating a yet more acidic species. In transformed but not normal cells, the major form is phosphorylated at tyrosine and serine, yielding a fourth isoelectric variant. The 46,000-dalton unphosphorylated protein has been partially purified, and antiserum to it recognizes all four isoelectric variants of the protein. The 39,000-dalton protein has two unphosphorylated forms of which the more acidic is a minor species. The major form is phosphorylated at tyrosine and serine in transformed cells only. The 39,000-dalton unphosphorylated protein has been partially purified, and antiserum raised to it recognizes all three isoelectric variants. The 28,000-dalton protein has a single phosphorylated form which contains serine in normal cells, but both serine and tyrosine in transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078660971,"The growth and maturation of the transcription products on the Balbiani ring (BR) genes in Chironomus tentans has been characterized by electron microscopy. The BR transcript is packed into a series of well defined ribonucleoprotein structures of increasing complexity: a 10 nm fiber, a 19 nm fiber, a 26 nm fiber, and a 50 nm granule. The basic 10 nm element was revealed in Miller spreads. The in situ structure of the transcription products and RNA compaction estimates suggested that the 10 nm fiber is packed into the 19 nm fiber as a tight coil. The transition of the 19 nm fiber into the 26 nm fiber is accompanied by a major change of the basic 10 nm fold into a noncoiled structure. Finally, the 26 nm fiber makes a one and one-third left-handed turn forming the final product, the BR granule. Upon translocation through the nuclear pore the BR granule becomes rod-shaped, which most likely corresponds to a relaxation of the highest-order structure into a straight 26 nm fiber."
https://openalex.org/W1483293311,"Complement component C5 is converted to C5a and C5b by the cobra venom factor-dependent C3/C5 convertase CVF,Bb (EC 3.4.21.47). The C5 convertase produces selective proteolytic cleavage of an arginyl-leucine peptide bond at positions 74-75 in the alpha chain of C5. Circular dichroism studies in both the far and near UV regions provide evidence that a conformational change accompanies the C5 activation process. When C5 is activated by CVF,Bb in the presence of complement component C6, the C5b,6 complex is formed. However, when C6 is added after C5 has been converted to C5b, the C5b,6 complex fails to form. Therefore, the activation of C5 results in a transient binding site for C6. Hydrophobic sites are probably exposed upon C5 activation because C5b undergoes aggregation when C5 is converted to C5b in the absence of C6. Transmission electron micrographs of the C5 molecule indicate a multilobal, irregular ultrastructure with estimated dimensions of 104 X 140 X 168 A. Aggregated C5b has the appearance of globular particles with a diameter range of 350-700 A. Although C5 shares a number of features with the third component of complement, including a similar ultrastructure and partial sequence homology, C5 is devoid of the unusual thiol ester linkage found in C3. It is the labile thiol ester that permits covalent attachment between C3 and nucleophilic acceptors. In contrast, interactions between C5 and C6 or C5 and membranes remain noncovalent."
https://openalex.org/W1594493503,"Hepatocytes were prepared from rats previously fed either a normal diet or diets containing cholestyramine or cholestyramine plus mevinolin. The rates of synthesis and degradation of HMG-CoA reductase were determined by immunoprecipitation of the enzyme from cells radiolabeled with [35S]methionine during standard pulse or pulse-chase experiments. In cells prepared from rats fed either a normal diet or a diet supplemented with cholestyramine or cholestyramine plus mevinolin, the relative rates of reductase synthesis were 0.08, 0.21, and 0.99%, respectively, of the rates of total cellular protein synthesis. The corresponding apparent half-lives of the enzyme were approximately 114 min, 153 min, and greater than 10 h. We propose that the elevated reductase activity observed in rats fed cholestyramine and mevinolin (Tanaka, R. D., Edwards, P. A., Lan, S.-F., Knoppel, E. M., and Fogelman, A. M. (1982) J. Lipid Res. 23, 1026-1031) is a result of both increased enzyme synthesis and stabilization of the enzyme. We demonstrate that enzyme stabilization is not an inherent property of the enzyme but is dependent on the presence of mevinolin. We propose that enzyme stabilization results from the decreased cellular levels of some product produced endogenously from mevalonate."
https://openalex.org/W1568178675,"A monoclonal antibody against purified rat urinary kallikrein was coupled to agarose and used to isolate kallikrein from rat brain. The purified enzyme has N alpha-tosyl-L-arginine methyl esterase activity with a pH optimum at 9.0, kinin-releasing activity from a purified low molecular weight kininogen, and a parallelism with standard curves of rat urinary kallikrein in a direct radioimmunoassay. Brain kallikrein is inhibited by a series of tissue kallikrein inhibitors with IC50 values similar to those for urinary kallikrein. The purified brain enzyme was labeled with [14C]diisopropylphosphorofluoridate and visualized by fluorography on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme was closely similar to that of urinary kallikrein with estimated Mr of approximately 38,000. With Western blot analyses using a rabbit anti-kallikrein antibody, both brain and urinary kallikrein were visualized at identical positions by immunoperoxidase staining and by autoradiography with 125I-protein A binding. Brain mRNA was used to direct cell-free protein synthesis in wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems. [35S]Methionine-labeled kallikrein was identified by fluorography of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels after the translation products were subject to immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified kallikrein antibody. Collectively, the data show that tissue kallikrein exists in brain and can be synthesized by brain mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1612182582,"We determined that the rate of insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor is independent of receptor concentration and thus proceeds via an intramolecular process. This result is consistent with the possibility that ligand-dependent autophosphorylation may be a means by which cells can distinguish occupied from unoccupied receptors. We employed dithiothreitol to dissociate tetrameric receptor into alpha beta halves in order to further elucidate the structural requirements for the receptor-mediated kinase activity. Dithiothreitol had a complex biphasic effect on insulin-stimulated receptor kinase activity. Marked stimulation of kinase activity was observed at 1-2 mM dithiothreitol when the receptor was predominantly tetrameric and kinase activity diminished when dimeric alpha beta receptor halves predominate (greater than 2 mM dithiothreitol). N-Ethylmaleimide inhibits insulin-stimulated receptor kinase activity. We suggest that the tetrameric holoreceptor is the most active kinase structure and this structure requires for maximal activity, a reduced sulfhydryl group at or near the active site. We treated receptor preparations with elastase to generate receptor proteolytically nicked in the beta subunit. This treatment completely abolishes insulin-dependent autophosphorylation and histone phosphorylation with essentially no effects on insulin binding as determined by affinity labeling of the receptor alpha subunit. We suggest such treatment functionally uncouples insulin binding from insulin-stimulated receptor kinase activity. The possible physiological significance of these findings is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1482272657,"The displacement loop region of human mitochondrial DNA contains the origin of heavy strand DNA replication and is the most likely site of promotion of transcription of both heavy and light strands. In order to identify relevant control regions for initiation of transcription, a partially purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase activity was isolated and utilized in a runoff transcription assay using a cloned portion of the displacement loop region as the DNA template. Analysis of the transcription products from differentially cleaved DNA templates reveals that specific light strand transcripts are synthesized and no heavy strand transcripts are detectable. The 5' ends of the light strand transcripts map within a unique trinucleotide site on the heavy strand template at a position which overlaps the pentanucleotide map position of the 5' ends of in vivo 7 S RNA light strand transcripts. By using templates that have been truncated at the 5' or 3' end, an upper limit on the size of template sequence required for synthesis of the specific light sequence required for synthesis of the specific light strand transcripts can be defined as the 433-nucleotide genomic region between the 5' 10 nucleotides of the 12 S rRNA gene and a BalI restriction site in the displacement loop region that is 352 nucleotides from the gene boundary for tRNAPhe. Two of the previously identified conserved sequences of the mammalian displacement loop region are not required for synthesis of the light strand transcripts. The location of the in vitro light strand transcripts is consistent with a functional role in either in vivo transcription or priming of heavy strand DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1503746108,"The reaction of a series of azapeptides with porcine pancreatic (PP) elastase and human leukocyte (HL) elastase has been studied and a series of new inhibitors and active site titrants were found for both PP elastase and HL elastase. Azapeptide p-nitrophenyl esters acylate both HL and PP elastase to form stable acylenzymes, which can be used for crystallographic studies. We have investigated the effect of a P1, P2, or P3 aza-amino acid residue on the reactivity of azapeptides with elastase. We have also studied the effect of changing the nature of the P1' leaving group and other portions of azapeptide structure. N-Acetyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-alpha-azaalanine p-nitrophenyl ester, N-acetyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-alpha-azanorleucine p-nitrophenyl ester, and N-acetyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-alpha-azanorvaline p-nitrophenyl ester are suitable titrants for either PP or HL elastase."

https://openalex.org/W2162614457,"The sup-5 III and sup-7 X suppressors in C. elegans have previously been shown to have many genetic properties in common with tRNA nonsense suppressors of microorganisms. We report here the results of two lines of investigation into the molecular basis of these suppressors. In one, which sought to determine the nature of suppressible alleles, we demonstrate through DNA sequencing studies that a suppressible allele, unc-54(e 1300) I, of the myosin heavy chain gene contains a C leads to T substitution, which changes a glutamine codon to amber terminator at residue 1903. In the other approach, which sought to define the nature of the suppressing activity, we show through in vitro translation studies that tRNA fractions from the suppressor strains, but not wild-type, promote the specific readthrough of amber terminators of three different messenger RNAs. We conclude that sup-5 and sup-7 result in readthrough of amber terminators in vivo through an altered tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1539133960,"The reactive site of human alpha 1-antichymotrypsin has been identified as encompassing a leucyl-seryl bond at the apparent P1 and P'1 positions. This has been determined by dissociation of complexes of the inhibitor with bovine alpha-chymotrypsin, followed by identification of new NH2-terminal sequences, as well as by proteolytic inactivation by porcine pancreatic elastase. The latter results in peptide bond cleavage between the apparent P5 and P4 positions of the inhibitor, yielding a fragment whose sequence overlaps with that obtained through complex dissociation. Some homology with the sequence obtained and that already reported for both antithrombin III and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor can be noted."
https://openalex.org/W1901851284,"Stimulation of platelets by thrombin causes an increase in the amount of cytoskeleton proteins insoluble in 1% Triton X-100, i.e. myosin, actin, actin-binding protein, an alpha-actinin-like protein of Mr = 105,000, unidentified polypeptides of Mr = 150,000, 31,00, and under some conditions, 56,000. Concurrently the Mr = 20,000 light chains of myosin and a cytoplasmic Mr = 42,000 polypeptide are phosphorylated, presumably by calmodulin-Ca2+-dependent myosin light chain kinase and a phospholipid-Ca2+-dependent kinase, respectively. The adenylate cyclase stimulators prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and forskolin increased platelet cyclic AMP and prevented the phosphorylation of these polypeptides and the increase in Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton proteins. When added to platelets after stimulation by thrombin they caused rapid complete reversal of myosin light chain and Mr = 42,000 polypeptide phosphorylation; simultaneously the association of myosin with the cytoskeleton proteins and the increase in the content of each of the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton proteins (except the Mr = 56,000 polypeptide) was reversed. The amount of Triton-insoluble myosin was affected more readily by PGD2 or forskolin than were the other proteins. Increasing thrombin from 0.1 to 1.0 unit/ml inhibited all the responses to PGD2 and forskolin possibly due to concentration-dependent effects of thrombin that inhibit adenylate cyclase. These results suggest that cytoskeleton assembly and activation of the contractile apparatus in intact platelets are readily reversible by cyclic AMP-dependent reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1536136747,"We have chemically modified groups of amino acids in the sequence of alpha-cobratoxin and have studied the derivatives as to their affinity of binding to the acetylcholine receptor protein from Torpedo marmorata. (i) The toxin derivatives which were fully modified at lysine (penta-epsilon-N,N-dimethyl lysine; penta-epsilon-N-acetyl lysine), arginine (penta-N7,N8-(1,2-dihydroxycyclohex-1,2-ylene arginine), and tyrosine (mononitrotyrosine) all had significant remaining toxicity and affinity of binding. (ii) The disulfide of alpha-cobratoxin was selectively reduced and alkylated. Depending on the charge, size, and hydrophobicity of the attached groups, derivatives were obtained that bound to the acetylcholine receptor with higher (di-S-carboxyamidomethyl), about equal (di-S-pyridylethyl), or lower (di-iodoacetaminoethylnaphthylamine-5-sulfonic acid) affinity than the unmodified toxin. (iii) A fully reduced and carbamidomethylated derivative of alpha-cobratoxin obtained by repeating the procedure for selective reduction six times still bound with appreciable affinity (KD approximately 3 X 10(-6) M) to the acetylcholine receptor. We conclude that neither a single positively charged residue nor tyrosine nor the integrity of the disulfides is absolutely essential for toxicity. Furthermore, the single tyrosine and the area around the extra disulfide do not participate in the binding to the receptor. Together with previous findings on this interaction, this suggests a multipoint attachment of toxin and receptor involving several locally separate structural elements of the toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1491237609,"The formation of 80 S initiation complexes containing labeled viral mRNA was drastically inhibited when mRNA binding assays were carried out with reticulocyte lysate preincubated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When the assays were analyzed by centrifugation on sucrose gradients, the mRNA incubated with lysate pretreated with dsRNA sedimented as a 48 S complex. Met-tRNA, GDP, and phosphorylated initiation factor eIF-2(alpha P) were shown to co-sediment with the 48 S complex. Therefore, the formation of this complex was attributed to the phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha by a dsRNA-activated protein kinase. These observations suggested that mRNA could bind to a 40 S ribosomal subunit containing Met-tRNAf, GDP, and eIF-2(alpha P), but the joining of a 60 S ribosomal subunit was inhibited. When the 48 S complex was isolated and incubated with lysate without added dsRNA, the mRNA could form 80 S initiation complexes. The shift of mRNA from 48 S to 80 S complexes was also observed when the eIF-2 alpha kinase activity was inhibited by the addition of 2-aminopurine. This shift was quite slow, however, when compared to the rate of binding of free mRNA to 80 S initiation complexes. The 2-aminopurine was effective in reversing the inhibition of protein synthesis by dsRNA and in maintaining a linear rate of protein synthesis for 3 h in lysates. Without added 2-aminopurine, protein synthesis was inhibited after 90 min even in lysates supplemented with hemin and eIF-2(alpha P) was detected in these lysates. This finding indicated that eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation could be in part responsible for limiting the duration of protein synthesis in mammalian cell-free systems."
https://openalex.org/W1546072668,"The c2 repressor of bacteriophage P22 can be digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase to yield stable fragments. Purified NH2-terminal fragments, like intact repressor, bind specifically to P22 operator DNA and also mediate positive and negative control of transcription. COOH-terminal fragments of repressor do not bind operator DNA but do undergo a concentration-dependent oligomerization similar to that observed with intact repressor. These results suggest that P22 repressor, like the related cI repressor of phage lambda, contains two structural domains which mediate different functions of the intact molecule."

Such stimulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis by the fetal membranes, by way of a substance released into the urine and thence into amniotic fluid, could serve as a signal for the initiation of parturition."
https://openalex.org/W1575126836,"Factor B is the zymogen of the catalytic site bearing subunit Bb of the C3/C5 convertase of the alternative pathway of complement. In this study, the location of the C3b binding site and the catalytic site within the Bb subunit were investigated. When human Factor B was treated with porcine elastase, fragments with respective molecular weights of 36,000, 35,000, 33,000, 31,000, and 25,000 were generated. Binding studies showed that only the 33,000-dalton fragment was capable of binding to C3b. The 33,000-dalton fragment was purified using fast protein liquid chromatography and found to be part of the Bb fragment upon testing with monoclonal antibody 15-6-19-1. Amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the 33,000-dalton fragment placed it in the C-terminal half of Bb. The fragment expressed esterolytic activity as evidenced by cleavage of the synthetic substrate N alpha-acetyl-glycyl-L-lysine methyl ester and restored alternative pathway activity in Factor B-depleted serum. Its hemolytic activity was approximately 60-fold lower than that of Factor B. Comparative binding studies in the presence of metal ions using zymosan-C3b showed that the 33,000-dalton fragment bound to C3b with higher affinity than Factor B. Addition of the fragment to human serum inhibited alternative pathway activation by rabbit erythrocytes due to its high affinity for C3b and its low hemolytic activity compared to Factor B. These results show that the C-terminal 33,000-dalton portion of Bb contains not only the enzymatic site of Bb but also a C3b binding site which confers hemolytic activity upon the fragment. The observation that the fragment inhibited alternative pathway activation suggests that a synthetic peptide may be constructed that exhibits negative regulator activity in the alternative pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1569834217,"Although alkaline phosphatase has been long associated with the mineralization process, its exact function remains to be elucidated. To clarify its possible role in matrix vesicle-mediated mineralization, we tested the effect of vanadate, a phosphate analogue and powerful competitive inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase activity, on calcium and phosphate uptakes by a matrix vesicle-enriched microsomal fraction. Vanadate was also tested in a hydroxyapatite-seeded ion uptake system to determine possible direct effects on mineral formation. The effect of vanadate on vesicle mineral ion uptake was complex; low dosages of vanadate (2-20 microM) were stimulatory to Ca2+ uptake, but were inhibitory to Pi. Higher dosages (greater than 67 microM) were inhibitory to both ions. The effect of vanadate on ion uptake was strongly influenced by the stage of vesicle loading; major effects were seen during the lag and early uptake phases, and minimal effects were seen in the terminal stages. Concentrations of vanadate highly inhibitory to vesicle ion uptake had minimal effects on ion accretion by a hydroxyapatite-seeded system. Inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity by vanadate broadly paralleled inhibition of Pi and Ca2+ uptake; however, at low vanadate concentrations, inhibition of Pi uptake closely paralleled that of alkaline phosphatase. The data indicate that vanadate binds with high affinity to Pi-loading sites, blocking initial Pi uptake. Complexation between vanadate and Ca2+ may be responsible for the stimulation of Ca2+ uptake at early stages of vesicle ion loading with low levels of vanadate by enhancing binding of Ca2+ to the vesicles. It may also account for the selective inhibition of Ca2+ uptake during the rapid stage of vesicle ion loading with high levels of vanadate by reducing Ca2+ ion activity. The close parallelism between inhibition of early Pi uptake and of alkaline phosphatase activity supports the concept that alkaline phosphatase is involved in Pi transport during the early stages of matrix vesicle ion loading. However, the fact that only about half of the Pi uptake was affected by vanadate, despite the progressive inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity, indicates that alkaline phosphatase is not solely responsible for Pi uptake by the matrix vesicle-enriched fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1853005552,"Human plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) are the major carriers of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters in the circulation. Their increased levels correlate positively with increased risk of coronary artery disease. LDL contain a single major apolipoprotein of apparent molecular weight (Mr) = 550,000, designated apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100), and in some LDL preparations, minor components termed apoB-74 (410,000) and apoB-26 (145,000). The structural relationship of the apoB-74 and -26 proteins to the apoB-100 has remained obscure and their roles in cholesterol metabolism are unknown. In the present study, we show that the addition of kaolin to plasma anticoagulated with EDTA induces the proteolytic cleavage of apoB-100. As a result, two apoB peptides are produced with Mr indistinguishable from plasma apoB-74 and -26. The specific cleavage of apoB-100 was mimicked in vitro by purified human plasma and tissue kallikreins. In contrast, thrombin, factor Xa, plasmin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin did not produce these peptides when incubated with LDL. The findings of the study suggest that apoB-74 and -26 are proteolytic fragments of apoB-100 and that the endogenous protease has a kallikrein-like specificity for DLD-apoB-100. The role of plasma and tissue kallikreins in cholesterol metabolism remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2022799178,"We have constructed a series of single and double base-pair-substitution mutants in and around the second component (Box B) of the promoter of a tRNAPro gene from C. elegans. Their analysis in in vivo and in vitro transcriptional systems establishes the importance of single nucleotides in the promotion of transcription. Most mutants in the region coding for the TψCG stem-loop show a reduced gene expression associated with lack of processing of the primary transcriptional products; in the oocytes these are rapidly degraded, with a half-life considerably shorter than that of wild-type tRNA molecules. In contrast, mutations in the DNA region coding for the anticodon stem-loop do not alter the efficiency of transcription or the processing of the transcripts."

The principal features of the x-ray crystallographic analysis are reproduced, and the amplitudes of atomic displacements appear to be determined by the degree of exposure of the atoms. An analysis of the hydrogen bonds shows a correlation between the average length of a bond and the fluctuation in that length and reveals a rocking motion of bases in Watson-Crick guanine X cytosine base pairs. The in-plane motions of the bases are generally of larger amplitude than the out-of-plane motions, and there are correlations in the motions of adjacent bases."
https://openalex.org/W1484240548,"Proteolysis of 125I-high molecular weight (Mr) kininogen occurred in kaolin-activated plasma which was deficient in prekallikrein, but not in plasma which lacked both prekallikrein and Hageman factor (HF) activity. The implication of this observation is that HF itself might be capable of releasing kinin from high Mr kininogen. This concept was further supported by the following studies. In a purified protein system rabbit (Mr = 80,000) two-chain activated HF (alpha-HFa) incubated with human 125I-high Mr kininogen caused rapid proteolysis of the kininogen in the presence, but not in the absence, of kaolin. This was in contrast to the effect of kallikrein on proteolysis of high Mr kininogen which was inhibited 10-fold by the presence of kaolin. The possibilities that the alpha-HFa preparation was contaminated by rabbit kallikrein or that the human high Mr kininogen preparation was contaminated by human prekallikrein were excluded by using specific antibodies (IgG) against these proteins. The proteolytic fragments of 125I-high Mr kininogen generated by both alpha-HFa and kallikrein were indistinguishable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis. Bioassayable kinin was released from high Mr kininogen following incubation with alpha-HFa in the presence of kaolin. The amount of kinin released in proportion to the extent of proteolysis was the same for both kallikrein and alpha-HFa. The data show that activated Hageman factor may cause release of kinin by proteolytic cleavage of high Mr kininogen. This phenomenon occurs not only in a purified system of proteins but also in kaolin-activated plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1548980675,"In order to gain some insight into the structural parameters important for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex formation, we have examined the effect of various salts and detergents on the stability and structure of the synthetase complex. Certain neutral salts were found to inactivate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities in the complex, and the order of effectiveness in this process followed a classical Hofmeister series. In addition, one of these salts, NaSCN, was also effective in partially dissociating the complex. Detergents varied in their ability to inactivate synthetases, with ionic detergents being most effective and nonionic detergents being much less destructive. Detergents, by themselves, could partially disrupt the complex; however, in the presence of 1 M NaCl, nonionic detergents did lead to considerable dissociation of synthetases and generation of low molecular weight forms of these enzymes. Removal of lipids from the complex with the nonionic detergent, Triton X-114, rendered arginyl-tRNA synthetase sensitive to the addition of NaCl. However, this salt sensitivity was abolished by readdition of a lipid extract isolated from the complex. These results implicate hydrophobic interactions in the stability of the synthetase complex, and suggest the possible involvement of lipids in maintaining its structural integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1575311572,"A ribosomal subunit antiassociation activity has been purified from both the postribosomal supernatant and ribosomal salt-wash protein fractions of rabbit reticulocyte lysates. A majority (greater than 90%) of the activity is associated with a low molecular weight protein of Mr of approximately 25,000. A small but significant level of antiassociation activity (less than 10%) was found to be associated with higher molecular weight protein fractions. The purified 25,000-dalton antiassociation factor interacts with 60 S ribosomal subunits to prevent them from reassociating with 40 S ribosomal subunits. The factor does not seem to interact directly with 40 S subunits nor does it dissociate 80 S monosomes. The properties of this factor are thus similar to the eukaryotic initiation factor 6 isolated from both wheat germ and calf liver extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1583776738,"Isometrically suspended uteri from estrogen-primed rats were stimulated with prostaglandin F2 alpha and then exposed to relaxin. Relaxin-dependent decreases in the ratio of phosphorylated to total myosin light chains (MLC) and in MLC kinase activity, measured in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml of uterine myosin and the absence and presence of Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM), were observed. The time-course and concentration-response of these biochemical effects of relaxin paralleled the hormone-induced inhibition of uterine contractile activity. Relaxin treatment resulted in a change in the requirements of MLC kinase for Ca2+, CaM, and myosin. Titrations of MLC kinase activity showed a shift in K50 values for Ca2+ from 82 to 260 nM and for CaM from 2.2 to 25 nM in extracts from control and relaxin-treated tissues, respectively. The myosin Km values of MLC kinase from control and relaxin-treated tissues were 0.33 and 0.71 mg/ml, respectively. Under optimal assay conditions (100 microM Ca2+, 1 microM CaM, and 1.2 mg/ml of myosin) the activities of MLC kinase in both extracts were identical, regardless of hormone concentration or exposure time. These data suggest that relaxin-treatment results in a change in the affinity of MLC kinase for its substrate and modulator and that relaxin inhibits uterine contractile activity by a mechanism which involves a decrease in MLC kinase activity and, in turn, a decrease in phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton light chains of myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1595893033,"Limited proteolysis of high molecular weight kininogen by kallikrein resulted in the generation of an inactive heavy chain of Mr = 64,000 and active light chains of Mr = 64,000 and 51,000 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Starting with kininogen from outdated plasma, a light chain with an apparent molecular weight of 51,000 on 7.5% SDS gels was purified and characterized. Molecular weights of 28,900 +/- 1,100 and 30,500 +/- 1,600 were obtained by gel filtration of the reduced and alkylated protein in 6 M guanidine HCl and equilibrium sedimentation under nondenaturing conditions in the air-driven ultracentrifuge, respectively. The light chain stained positively with periodic acid-Schiff reagent on SDS gels indicating that covalently attached carbohydrate may be responsible for the anomalously high molecular weight estimated by SDS-gel electrophoresis. A single light chain thiol group reacted with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) in the presence and absence of 6 M guanidine HCl. Specific fluorescent labeling of the thiol group with 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein (IAF) occurred without loss of clotting activity. Addition of purified human plasma prekallikrein to the IAF-light chain resulted in a maximum increase in fluorescence anisotropy of 0.041 +/- 0.001 and no change in the fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements of the equilibrium binding of prekallikrein to the IAF-light chain yielded an average Kd of 17.3 +/- 2.5 nM and stoichiometry of 1.07 +/- 0.07 mol of prekallikrein/mol of IAF-light chain. Measurements of the interaction of prekallikrein with iodoacetamide-alkylated light chain using the IAF-light chain as a probe gave an average Kd of 16 +/- 4 nM and stoichiometry of 1.0 +/- 0.2 indicating indistinguishable affinities for prekallikrein."
https://openalex.org/W1663247332,"The screening of antisuppressor mutants of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been successfully accomplished with high resolution liquid chromatographic methods for the analysis of tRNA nucleosides. Antisuppressor mutations reduce or abolish the function of nonsense suppressor-tRNAs or other informational suppressors. Nonradioactive or 35S-labeled unfractionated tRNA from various strains was digested to nucleosides and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The mutant sin3 has lost the nucleoside 5-(methoxycarbonylmethyl)-2-thiouridine from its tRNA in comparison to parental strains. In eukaryotes this nucleoside is found at the first position of the anticodon (wobble position) in several isoacceptor tRNAs that preferentially recognize codons ending with adenosine. The sin3 mutation reduces the efficiency of UGA and UAA suppressor tRNASer and suppressor tRNALeu. The genetic cosegregation of modification loss, antisuppressor phenotype, and a change in cell size is demonstrated. This indicates that a single mutation in the structural gene for a tRNA modification enzyme causes the three different phenotypes."

A substance that inhibits gastric acid secretion in a toad stomach preparation in vitro appears to be secreted by the developing young. This substance has been identified as prostaglandin E2. Rheobatrachus silus may thus have developed a mechanism whereby prostaglandin secreted by the larvae inhibits acid secretion in the stomach of the female until the larvae have completed development and emerged as juvenile frogs by way of the female's mouth.
https://openalex.org/W2053469590,"The application of directed selection techniques and genetic engineering methods for manipulation of antibiotic-producing microorganisms is generating a new era in industrial microbiology. Modern methods, based on advances in the knowledge of the biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms involved in the induction and repression of genes involved in antibiotic synthesis, provide a means of increasing antibiotic activity. Hence, recombinant DNA and protoplast fusion methods are used to alter the genetics of antibiotic producers in a semirandom fashion for the development of novel hybrid antibiotics. Directed mutation and selection, protoplast fusion, and both semirandom and specific recombinant DNA methods are examples of alternative procedures for manipulating the biosynthetic pathways of microorganisms for strain improvement and for new hybrid antibiotic synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1556105090,"Two soluble enzyme activities, beta-estradiol dehydrogenase and 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, copurified from the cytosol fraction of human term placenta, were identically inactivated by 6 beta-bromoacetoxyprogesterone. This affinity alkylating steroid binds at the enzyme-active site (Km = 866 microM; Vmax = 0.073 mumol/min/mg). Enzyme inactivation by four concentrations of 6 beta-bromoacetoxyprogesterone (molar ratio of steroid to enzyme, 71/1 to 287/1) causes irreversible and time-dependent loss of both the beta- and 20 alpha-activities according to first order kinetics and affirms that the alkylating steroid is an active site-directed inhibitor (KI = 2.7 X 10(-3) M; k3 = 1.6 X 10(-3) s-1). Affinity radioalkylation studies using 6 beta-[2'-14C]bromoacetoxyprogesterone indicate that 2 mol of steroid are bound to each mole of inactivated enzyme dimer (Mr = 68,000). Amino acid analyses of the acid hydrolysate of radioalkylated enzyme show that 6 beta-bromoacetoxyprogesterone carboxymethylates cysteine (56%), histidine (22%), and lysine (8%) residues in the active site. These results are identical with those reported for 2-bromo[2'-14C]acetamidoestrone methyl ether radioalkylation of purified 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase. The parallel inactivation of beta-estradiol dehydrogenase and 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase by 6 beta-bromoacetoxyprogesterone further shows that both activities reside at a single enzyme-active site. The radioalkylation profile supports our proposed model of one enzyme-active site wherein the bound progestin and estrogen substrates are inverted, one relative to the other."
https://openalex.org/W1573176470,"Three elongation factors, EF-1 alpha, EF-1 beta gamma and EF-2, have been isolated from wheat germ. EF-1 alpha and EF-2 are single polypeptides with molecular weights of approximately 52,000 and 102,000, respectively. The most highly purified preparations of EF-1 beta gamma contain four polypeptides with molecular weights of approximately 48,000, 46,000 and 36,000, 34,000. EF-1 alpha supports poly(U)-directed binding of Phe-tRNA to wheat germ ribosomes and catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP in the presence of ribosomes, poly(U), and Phe-tRNA. EF-2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP in the presence of ribosomes alone and is ADP-ribosylated by diphtheria toxin to the extent of 0.95 mol of ADP-ribose/mol of EF-2. EF-1 beta gamma decreases the amount of EF-1 alpha required for polyphenylalanine synthesis about 20-fold. EF-1 beta gamma enhances the ability to EF-1 alpha to support the binding of Phe-tRNA to the ribosomes and enhances the GTPase activity of EF-1 alpha. Wheat germ EF-1 alpha, EF-1 beta gamma, and EF-2 support polyphenylalanine synthesis on rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes as well as on yeast ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1499334739,"Incubation of rat hepatocytes, prepared from rats fed a normal diet, with either human high density lipoproteins or lecithin dispersions resulted in a dose-and time-dependent increase in the specific activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Incubation of cells with both high density lipoprotein and lecithin dispersions resulted in an additive stimulation of enzymic activity. We used pulse and pulse-chase experiments, followed by immunoprecipitation of the radiolabeled reductase, to demonstrate that high density lipoproteins and lecithin dispersions resulted in increased rates of synthesis and decreased rates of degradation of the reductase. We also demonstrate, by the use of immunoblots, that the increased enzymic activity was paralleled by an equivalent increase in the mass of the reductase. Addition of human low density lipoprotein to rat hepatocytes resulted in a small decrease in both enzymic activity and enzyme synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1537742850,"The middle T antigen (MT Ag) encoded by polyoma virus has an associated protein kinase activity which transfers a phosphoryl group from ATP or GTP to a tyrosine residue on MT Ag in immunoprecipitates formed between polyoma virus-infected or transformed cell extracts and serum from animals bearing polyoma-induced tumors. Incubation of such immunoprecipitates or polyoma-transformed cell extracts prior to immunoprecipitation with the sulfhydryl reagent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), resulted in a significant inhibition of MT Ag-associated kinase activity. Inactivation of this enzyme activity by NEM was found to be dependent upon the incubation pH, time of incubation, and NEM concentration. ATP, GTP, and ADP in the presence of Mg2+ were found to decrease the rate of NEM-mediated inactivation of MT Ag-associated kinase activity, while CTP and UTP did not detectably alter the rate of enzyme inhibition by NEM. These results suggest that the MT Ag-associated kinase possesses at least one NEM-sensitive sulfhydryl group essential for phosphotransferase activity which may be present at or near the enzyme catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1561752489,"A cytoplasmic 10 S ribonucleoprotein (iRNP) isolated from chick embryonic muscle is a potent inhibitor of mRNA translation in vitro and contains a 4 S translation inhibitory RNA species (iRNA) (Sarkar, S., Mukherjee, A. K., and Guha, C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5077-5086). Using an in vitro assay system, we show that the iRNA has no effect on the elongation phase of peptide synthesis. iRNA inhibits translation at the initiation step by inhibiting mRNA binding to 43 S initiation complexes. The iRNA does not inhibit the binding of Met-tRNAf to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, but rather causes an increase in the level of 43 S initiation complexes in the reticulocyte lysate. The formation of the 80 S initiation complex from the 43 S complex is specifically blocked in the presence of iRNA. The significance of these results in relation to biological function of iRNA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1504414736,"Chemical modification of 2 +/- 0.5 arginine residues of porcine pancreatic elastase by 1,2-cyclohexanedione leads to an 85 +/- 5% loss of activity with the specific substrate N-succinyltrialanine p-nitroanilide. Modification of additional arginines does not completely abolish the enzyme activity. The modification reaction is very fast (second order rate constant = 0.24 M-1 S-1) and involves only arginine residues. Acetyltetraalanine or trifluoroacetyltetraalanine decreases the rate of cyclohexanedione-induced inactivation of the enzyme but does not significantly change the number of modified arginine residues. Other dicarbonyl reagents, butanedione or phenylglyoxal, also react with elastase but at much lower rates. Cyclohexanedione-modified elastase is partially active against a series of synthetic substrates of varying chain length. The partial inhibition results from a 2- to 5-fold increase in Km while kappa cat is increased for most substrates. For N-succinyltrialanine p-nitroanilide both the acylation and deacylation rate constants are decreased. The Ki values of a series of acetylated and trifluoroacetylated inhibitors increase 2- to 5-fold. Modified elastase is still able to react with fibrous elastin and with plasma alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor but at significantly lower rates. Modification of one arginine residue alters the properties of the calcium-binding site of elastase as demonstrated by terbium luminescence experiments. The affinity of enzyme for terbium is decreased by a factor of 10 and the circularly polarized luminescence spectrum of the terbium-elastase complex is considerably flattened. Modification of further arginine residues does not increase the extent of these alterations. Circular dichroism shows that the overall conformation of elastase is not altered following arginine modification. We speculate that the two residues modified by cyclohexanedione are Arg 65, located at about 8 A from the metal ion-binding site, and Arg 217A, located at the S'3 subsite of elastase."
https://openalex.org/W1533488815,"It has been confirmed that the enzyme rhodanese, although a homogeneous single polypeptide chain protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is separable by electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions into four species which differ in net surface charge (I-IV in the order of increasing positive charge). Limited proteolysis can interconvert these species. Chymotrypsin converts IV and III to II and forms a small amount of I. Carboxypeptidase B converts IV to III. The total protein among the species remains constant, and two-dimensional gels show that the change induced is below the resolution of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel system. The suggestion that the products can be produced in the order IV, III, and II is supported by the results of sequential treatment of rhodanese first with carboxypeptidase B and then with chymotrypsin. It is concluded that there are covalent differences among the rhodanese species identified to date and an interconversion of forms can be triggered by proteolysis at the COOH-terminal end of the Mr = 33,000 single polypeptide chain which comprises the enzyme. This conclusion is strengthened by the close similarity between the amino acid composition of the peptide released by chymotrypsin and the composition expected on the basis of the known sequence. Furthermore, it appears that form IV is the primary in vivo product and the other species arise from it."
https://openalex.org/W1562100012,"The specific radioactivity of [3H]Leu in the extracellular, intracellular, and Leu-tRNA pools of normal (white leghorn) and dystrophic (line 307) embryonic chick breast muscle cultures was analyzed as a function of equilibration time and extracellular Leu concentration (0.05-5 mM). The primary results were the following 1) [3H]Leu equilibrated to a constant specific radioactivity in the intracellular and Leu-tRNA pools within 2 min after addition to both normal and dystrophic cultures. 2) After equilibration, the extracellular [3H] Leu specific radioactivity in dystrophic cell culture medium was lower than that of medium exposed to normal cells (especially at low Leu concentrations), probably because of increased release of unlabeled Leu from the dystrophic cells as a result of faster protein breakdown. Accordingly, the specific radioactivities in the intracellular and the Leu-tRNA pools were also lower in dystrophic cells. 3) At 5 mM extracellular Leu, the specific radioactivity in the Leu-tRNA pool was approximately 40% lower than the specific radioactivity in the intracellular pool in both normal and dystrophic cells. Thus, high concentrations of extracellular Leu cannot be used to flood out reutilization of unlabeled Leu (released by protein degradation) during protein synthesis. 4) At 5.0 mM extracellular Leu, the specific radioactivity of [3H]Leu in the intracellular pool was comparable to that in the extracellular pool in normal and dystrophic cells; however, the specific radioactivity of Leu-tRNA (i.e. the immediate precursor to protein synthesis) was only 55-65% of the extracellular specific radioactivity in normal and dystrophic cells. In conclusion, reutilization of Leu from protein degradation is higher in dystrophic muscle cell cultures than in normal muscle cell cultures, and accurate rates of protein synthesis in cell cultures can only be obtained if specific radioactivity of amino acid in tRNA is measured."
