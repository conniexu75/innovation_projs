https://openalex.org/W2110925400,"We have followed Ty transposition with a donor Ty element, TyH3, whose expression is under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Sequence analysis reveals dramatic structural differences in TyH3 before and after transposition. If the donor TyH3 is marked with an intron-containing fragment, the intron is correctly spliced out of the Ty during transposition, suggesting that the Ty RNA is the intermediate for transposition. Furthermore, the pattern of sequence inheritance in progeny Ty insertions derived from the marked Ty follows the predictions of the model of retroviral reverse transcription. Comparison of marked Ty elements before and after movement shows that transposition is highly mutagenic to the Ty element. These results demonstrate that during transposition, Ty sequence information flows from DNA to RNA to DNA."

The sequence reveals that the virus is highly polymorphic and lacks significant nucleotide homology with type C retroviruses characterized previously. Together with an analysis of the two major viral subgenomic RNAs, these studies establish the coding frames for the gag, pol and env genes and predict the expression of a novel gene at the 3' end of the genome unrelated to the X genes of HTLV-1 and -II."
https://openalex.org/W2021978074,"The thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus 1 was mutated by inserting oligodeoxynucleotide linkers into the region of the gene corresponding to the 5' untranslated portion of the mRNA. These linkers, when transcribed into mRNA, might be expected to form hairpin loops and hence to increase the secondary structure of the 5' end of the mRNA. Thymidine kinase insertion derivatives were examined in vivo and in vitro to determine translational efficiency. For the in vivo studies, thymidine kinase insertion derivatives were transfected into thymidine kinase deficient L cells alone and together with a selectable dominant marker, or were assayed in the COS-1 transient expression system. For in vitro studies, thymidine kinase insertion derivatives were subcloned into pSP64. Capped transcripts were analyzed for their ability to bind ribosomes and translate in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and wheat-germ extracts. The results demonstrate that translation efficiency is decreased as the number of linkers is increased and support the view that excessive secondary structure at the 5' end of eukaryotic mRNA impedes translation."
https://openalex.org/W2050536724,"The pathological destruction of collagen plays a key role in the development of inflammatory disease states affecting every organ system in the human body. Neutrophils localized at inflammatory sites can potentially degrade collagen by releasing a metalloenzyme, collagenase, which is stored in a latent inactive form. Triggered human neutrophils were shown to release and simultaneously activate their latent collagenase. The activation of the latent enzyme was coupled to an oxidative process that required the generation of a highly reactive oxygen metabolite, hypochlorous acid. Oxidative regulation of latent collagenase activity may be important in the pathogenesis of connective tissue damage in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1513838543,"A new gene function involved in the expression of mitochondrial cytochrome b is described. E158 is a respiratory deficient strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a recessive mutation in nuclear DNA. The block in mitochondrial respiration is a consequence of the mutant's inability to synthesize cytochrome b. This has been confirmed by analysis of the mitochondrial translation products in E158. Since the mutant has wild-type concentrations of mature cytochrome b mRNA, the absence of the cytochrome b protein cannot be due to a transcriptional or RNA-processing defect. The wild-type gene (CBP6) responsible for the observed phenotype has been cloned by transformation of E158 with a genomic library of yeast nuclear DNA. The cloned gene has been sequenced and shown to code for a basic protein with a molecular weight of 18,657. Both deletion and disruption of the CBP6 coding sequence in chromosomal DNA of wild-type yeast lead to respiratory deficiency with a concomitant loss of cytochrome b. Part of the CBP6 gene has been fused to the trpE gene on a high expression Escherichia coli vector. The hybrid protein encoded by the trpE/CBP6 fusion has been purified from E. coli and used as an antigen for antibody production. Antibodies to the hybrid protein cross-react with an 18-kDa protein present in yeast mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1982395246,"A novel strategy to determine the clonal origin of human tumors has been devised. The strategy involves the use of a cloned polymorphic X-chromosomal gene and two restriction endonucleases. The first endonuclease distinguishes the paternal and maternal copies of the gene through a DNA polymorphism of restriction fragment length. The second endonuclease distinguishes active from inactive copies of this gene through changes in DNA methylation. As illustrations of this strategy, three human cancers were each shown to be monoclonal. The analysis described should have a wide variety of clinical and experimental applications."
https://openalex.org/W1971436037,"Using a transient expression assay in HeLa cells, we show that products from the adenovirus-5 E1a transcription unit repress transcription from the SV40 early promoter. The repression is unrelated to T antigen autoregulation, occurs maximally with low concentrations of E1a expression plasmid, is exerted at the transcriptional level, and requires functional E1a protein. The 289 and 243 amino acid E1a proteins are equally effective at repressing transcription. Since only the 289 amino acid protein is efficient at activating transcription, we conclude that activation and repression are separate E1a functions. We discuss possible mechanisms for E1a repression and the relationship of repression to the function of E1a in cell immortalization and transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1526095797,"In the formation of covalent ubiquitin-protein conjugates that occurs during ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in reticulocyte extracts, ubiquitin (Ub) is activated to a thiol ester of the activating enzyme E1 (via the Ub carboxyl terminus), transferred to low-molecular weight (E2s) to form E2-Ub thiol esters, and then transferred by a third enzyme (E3) to amino groups on target proteins (Hershko, A., Heller, H., Elias, S., and Ciechanover, A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8206-8214). We report here the fractionation of Ub carrier proteins by molecular weight, and their characterization with respect to several activities. The Ub thiol ester forms of at least four of the five E2s catalyze Ub transfer to a number of small amines, in a reaction that does not require E3; only primary amines on primary carbons can serve as Ub acceptors. E3-independent Ub transfer to the small, basic proteins histones H2A and H2B, and cytochrome c, is also observed. The Ub thiol ester forms of two of the E2s were found to catalyze Ub transfer to cytochrome c. Only a single E2 functions in E3-dependent conjugate formation (with the substrates creatine phosphokinase, reduced/carboxymethylated serum albumin, and oxidized RNase) and in E3-dependent protein breakdown (with the substrate serum albumin). This E2 has a subunit molecular weight of 14,000 and migrates as a dimer on Sephacryl 200."
https://openalex.org/W2068629141,"Addition of norepinephrine to primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes stimulates the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in a dose-dependent manner. This effect has been observed in serum-free medium containing epidermal growth factor and insulin. Stimulation of DNA synthesis by norepinephrine was strongly antagonized by the α1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin but not by an α2 antagonist or by a β-adrenergic blocker. The β agonist isoproterenol did not stimulate significant DNA synthesis. These results indicate that catecholamines interact with the α1 adrenoreceptor to stimulate DNA synthesis in hepatocytes. Since α1 receptors are present in most cells, this receptor may be important in cell growth regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1494455361,"We have assessed the functional interactions of two pure receptor proteins with three different pure guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins in phosphatidylcholine vesicles. The receptor proteins are the guinea pig lung beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) and the retinal photon receptor rhodopsin. The guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins were the stimulatory (Ns) and inhibitory (Ni) proteins of the adenylate cyclase system and transducin (T), the regulatory protein from the light-activated cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase system in retinal rod outer segments. The insertion of Ns with beta AR in lipid vesicles increases the extent of binding of [35S] GTP gamma S to Ns and in parallel, the total GTPase activity. However, there is little change in the actual rate of catalytic turnover of GTPase activity (defined as mol of Pi released/min/mol of Ns-guanine nucleotide complexes). Enhancement of this turnover rate requires the beta-agonist isoproterenol and is accounted for by an isoproterenol-promoted increase in the rate and extent of [35S]GTP gamma S binding to Ns. The co-insertion of the beta AR with Ni or transducin results in markedly lower stimulation by isoproterenol of both the GTPase activity and [35S]GTP gamma S binding to these nucleotide regulatory proteins indicating that their preferred order of interaction with beta AR is Ns much greater than Ni greater than T. This contrasts with the preferred order of interaction of these different nucleotide regulatory proteins with light-activated rhodopsin which we find to be T approximately equal to Ni much greater than Ns. Nonetheless the stimulation of GTPase activity and [35S]GTP gamma S binding in T, induced by light-activated rhodopsin, is significantly greater than the fold stimulation of these activities in Ni. This reflects the greater intrinsic ability of Ni to hydrolyze GTP and bind guanine nucleotides (at 10 mM MgCl2, 100-200 nM GTP or [35S] GTP gamma S) compared to T. The maximum turnover numbers for the rhodopsin-stimulated GTPase in both Ni and T are similar to those obtained for isoproterenol-stimulated activity in Ns. This suggests that the different nucleotide regulatory proteins are capable of a common upper limit of catalytic efficiency which can best be attained when coupled to the appropriate receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1507444500,"Protein I from intestinal epithelium is biochemically and immunologically related to the fibroblast 36-kDa substrate of the Rous sarcoma virus-encoded tyrosine protein kinase (Gerke and Weber (1984) EMBO J. 3, 227-233). Protein I is a Ca2+-binding protein containing two copies each of a 36- and 10-kDa subunit. Denaturation/renaturation experiments show that the 36-kDa subunit is a monomer, whereas the 10-kDa subunit forms a dimer. Mixing of the subunits leads to reconstituted protein I. Physicochemical properties of protein I and its isolated subunits reveal a Ca2+-dependent conformational change in the 36-kDa subunit which involves the exposure of 1 or more tyrosine residues to a more aqueous environment. This change points to a Ca2+ binding constant of about 10(4) M-1 in the presence of 2 mM Mg2+ and induces the ability of protein I and the 36-kDa subunit to bind in vitro to F-actin and nonerythroid spectrin. The same high Ca2+ requirement has been reported for the in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of a 35-kDa protein from A-431 carcinoma cells by the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (Fava and Cohen (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2636-2645). Here we show that this 35-kDa substrate is biochemically and immunologically related to the 36-kDa subunit of protein I, which in turn corresponds to the substrate of the Rous sarcoma virus kinase. The protein of A-431 cells exists not only as a monomer but also as a dimer. The latter fraction contains a 10-kDa polypeptide immunologically related to the corresponding subunit of protein I. Given past results on the A-431 system, we speculate that the monomer rather than the dimer is the preferred in vitro substrate for the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase. Thus, the 10-kDa subunit, which induces dimerization of the phosphorylatable large subunit, may act as an inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1573558348,"The tumor co-promoter phorbol 12, myristate 13, acetate (PMA) has previously been shown to stimulate several of the characteristic functions (aggregation, degranulation, and the oxidative burst) of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils). We describe here a novel feature of the action of PMA on neutrophils, namely its ability to inhibit the chemotactic factor-induced increased in the enzyme secretion and in the intracellular concentration of free calcium. The inhibition is maximal within 3 min of the addition of PMA and is concentration-dependent (IC50 = 8.5 ng/ml). The site of action of PMA is distal to the binding of the chemotactic factors. PMA inhibits both the release of intracellular calcium and the permeability changes to calcium induced by chemotactic factors, but does not affect the stimulation of the rate of influx of sodium produced by the same agents. The PMA analog 4 alpha-phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate, which lack tumorigenicity and the ability to activate the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C), does not inhibit any of the above fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated neutrophil functions. The present results thus demonstrate that phorbol esters, either directly or indirectly, possibly through the activation of protein kinase C, inhibit the signal(s) responsible for the stimulated mobilization of calcium in rabbit neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W2005205976,"Intact erythrocytes placed into the tracheobronchial tree of hyperoxic rats dramatically improved their chances for survival. Over 70 percent of the animals so treated survived more than 12 days during continuous exposure to 95 percent oxygen, whereas all of the control animals died within 96 hours. Lungs from erythrocyte-protected rats showed almost none of the morphologic damage suffered by untreated animals. Erythrocytes containing cyanomethemoglobin were as beneficial as normal erythrocytes, but cells in which glutathione was partially blocked were significantly less protective. Analogous results were obtained in vitro: 51Cr-labeled target cells released 70 to 90 percent of their label when exposed briefly to hydrogen peroxide or to toxic oxygen species generated by phorbol ester-stimulated neutrophils. Addition of intact erythrocytes decreased release by approximately 75 percent, but significantly less than this if red blood cell glutathione was partially blocked. These results suggest that insufflated erythrocytes, through their recyclable glutathione, protect rats from toxic oxygen species engendered by hyperoxia."
https://openalex.org/W1600624424,"Using modifications of the methods of Bokoch et al. (Bokoch, G.M., Katada, T., Northup, J. K., Ui, M., and Gilman, A. G. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3560-3567) and Codina et al. (Codina, J., Hildebrandt, J. D., Sekura, R. D., Birnbaumer, M., Bryan, J., Manclark, C. R., Iyengar, R., and Birnbaumer, L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5871-5886), we have purified a pertussis toxin substrate with the expected characteristics of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Ni) essentially to homogeneity. The purified protein consists of 3 subunits of Mr 40,000, 35,000, and less than 10,000. The Mr 40,000 band is found, upon close examination, to consist of a poorly resolved doublet. Starting with the membranes from 1,320 g of bovine forebrain we purified the protein some 100-fold with approximately 20% yield to obtain 13 mg of a greater than 95% pure protein. Chromatography on octyl-Sepharose provided efficient separation of Ni from Ns (the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein). Analytical ultracentrifugation indicates an Mr of 82,000 and a sedimentation coefficient S20,w of 5.1. The protein is able to restore opiate-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase to membranes prepared from NG 108-15 cells which had been treated with pertussis toxin. Bovine brain Ni has the enzymatic properties of a low Km GTPase with a turnover number of 0.3 and affinities for nucleotides in the order GppNHp greater than or equal to GTP greater than or equal to GDP much greater than ATP, CTP, UTP, and GMP. Na+ specifically stimulates the GTPase and low concentrations of Mg2+ (less than 50 microM) are inhibitory. Some Mg2+ is apparently necessary because EDTA, but not EGTA, abolishes the GTPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1567928289,"We have examined the effect of estrogen on the rate of accumulation of apolipoproteins secreted by the human hepatocarcinoma cell line, HepG2. Prior to exposure to hormone, we detected less than 300 high-affinity, nuclear, estrogen-binding sites/cell. Within 48 h of growth in the presence of 20 nM 17 beta-estradiol this number rose to 3000-3500 sites/cell. Rates of accumulation of two of the major apolipoproteins, apo-C-II and apo-A-I increased 2.5- and 2.0-fold, respectively, in response to estrogen treatment. Other major apolipoproteins were not affected at this concentration of hormone. Induction of both proteins was completely antagonized by 20 nM testosterone. The density distribution of apolipoproteins secreted by the hepatocytes was similar to that reported using perfused liver systems. The consequences of estrogen treatment were to increase the apo-C-II/apo-C-III ratio in very low density lipoproteins as well as to decrease the overall very low density lipoprotein:high density lipoprotein ratio."
https://openalex.org/W1487575968,"The transport characteristics and regulation of the Na/K/Cl cotransport system were investigated in cultured human fibroblasts (HSWP cells). The existence of the system was documented by the finding that digitoxin-insensitive K+ influx was dependent upon the presence of both Na+ and Cl- in the extracellular milieu. It was found that only Br- could partially substitute for Cl-, with SCN-, I-, acetate, and gluconate being ineffective. Li+ could partially substitute for Na+; however, choline was without effect. The shape of the titration curves for K+ influx versus extracellular Cl- concentration was dependent upon the substituted anion. Furthermore, the apparent Km for Cl- at saturating [K+]o and [Na+]o, was also dependent upon the substituted anion and ranged from 30 mM (gluconate substitution) to 100 mM (acetate substitution). The titration curves for K+ influx versus extracellular Na+ concentration displayed hyperbolic kinetics and the apparent Km = 15 mM at saturating [K+]o. The curve for K+ influx versus extracellular K+ concentration was a hyperbola and the apparent Km for K+ = 3 mM at saturating [Na+]o. The digitoxin-insensitive K+ flux was found to be sensitive to related 5-sulfamoylbenzoic acid derivatives, commonly known as loop diuretics and to be insensitive to both: amiloride (3,5-diamino-N-(aminoiminomethyl)-6-chloropyrazinecarboxamide++ +) and 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid. The Na/K/Cl cotransport system was not stimulated by serum, but was slightly stimulated by two peptide mitogens. Furthermore, agents which cause an elevation in cellular cyclic AMP levels were found to be potent inhibitors of cotransport."

Two monoclonal antibodies, J4/4 and J10/14, react with different epitopes on external domains of the same Mr = 210,000 integral-membrane glycoprotein. At Fab fragment concentrations of equivalent cell surface binding, J10/14 inhibits the egg jelly-induced exocytotic acrosome reaction and associated Ca2+ influx and H+ efflux, whereas J4/4 does not.

https://openalex.org/W1511126269,"The synthesis of type III procollagen was examined in cultured fibroblasts from ten patients with type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a heritable disorder of connective tissue. With fibroblasts from nine patients, a decreased amount of labeled type III procollagen was recovered in the medium after the cells were incubated with radioactive amino acids for 24 h. The results were compatible with undefined defects in type III procollagen. The culture medium from one patient contained apparently normal amounts of type III procollagen after a 24-h labeling. However, the pro-alpha 1(III) chains from the medium of the patient's fibroblasts appeared as an abnormally broad band when examined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Analysis of fragments generated by vertebrate collagenase and cyanogen bromide located a structural defect between amino acid residues 555 and 775 in half of the alpha 1(III) chains. Most of the patient's type III procollagen was susceptible to digestion by pepsin or a mixture of chymotrypsin and trypsin at temperatures at which normal type III procollagen resisted digestion. Cyanogen bromide digestion of samples of the patient's skin revealed that the amount of type III was reduced more than 4-fold. The results support the hypothesis that both normal and structurally altered pro-alpha 1(III) chains are being incorporated into type III procollagen synthesized by the patient's fibroblasts and that type III procollagen molecules containing one, two, or three structurally altered pro-alpha 1(III) chains are rapidly degraded by proteinases in the tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1586338623,"Urine specimens from two sibs affected with cerebroside sulfatase activator deficiency were examined to ascertain whether the deficiency of the supplementary activator protein required for the enzymatic hydrolysis of cerebroside sulfate was also evident in urine. Material from chromatographic fractionations was examined for the activator activity to avoid ambiguities resulting from protein inhibition. There were substantial deficits in all chromatographic fractions corresponding to activator-containing fractions of control urines. Since patient urines contained elevated amounts of lactosylceramide, digalactosylceramide, and globotriaosylceramide and since similarities between activators for cerebroside sulfate and GM1 ganglioside hydrolyses had been noted previously, the chromatographic fractions were also examined for activators in other glycosphingolipid hydrolase systems. There was coincidence of activators for the GM1 ganglioside/beta-galactosidase and the globotriaosylceramide/alpha-galactosidase A reactions with the cerebroside sulfatase activator in control urine fractions, and the patients' urines were deficient in activator activities for the three reactions. Identity of the three activators was suggested and antiserum to purified GM1 ganglioside activator was used to test this possibility. There were depressed levels of cross-reacting material in fractions of patient urines by Ouchterlony double diffusion and in unfractionated urine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Purified activators for the cerebroside sulfate and GM1 ganglioside systems showed lines of identity with no spurring on Ouchterlony double diffusion, identical mobility on immunoelectrophoresis, and similar stimulatory activities toward hydrolysis of the three glycosphingolipid species by their respective enzymes. Finally, the three activator activities were retained by anti-GM1-activator IgG coupled to Sepharose 4B. The results suggest strongly that the same protein entity serves as activator for the enzymatic hydrolysis of cerebroside sulfate, GM1 ganglioside, and globotriaosylceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1527543972,"The T-cell growth factor (TCGF) receptor on phytohemagglutinin-activated normal peripheral blood T-cells is characterized as a glycoprotein with an apparent Mr = 55,000 that contains N-linked and O-linked carbohydrate with only approximately 33,000 daltons of peptide structure (p33) as evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. There are two N-linked glycosylated intermediate precursor forms (apparent Mr = 35,000 (p35) and 37,000 (p37]. This receptor differs from the TCGF receptor on HUT-102B2 cells (apparent Mr = 50,000) because of differences in post-translational processing. Experiments with the carboxylic ionophore monensin demonstrate blockade of the transition of the p35 and p37 receptor precursor forms to the mature receptor, presumably secondary to inhibition of Golgi-associated receptor processing. We identify the primary translation product of TCGF receptor mRNA as intermediate in size between the p33 and the p35/p37 forms. We further demonstrate that the p33, p35, and p37 precursor forms, but not the primary translation product, are all capable of binding TCGF. Thus, the removal of the signal peptide and/or conformational changes of the primary translation product are necessary for ligand binding; however, the extensive post-translational modifications are not. Lastly, we demonstrate that at least some TCGF receptors are phosphorylated and sulfated, and that TCGF receptors on phytohemagglutinin-activated normal T-cells are more heavily sulfated than those on HUT-102B2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1564466121,"We have used a recently developed cell-free system (cell lysate) derived from turkey erythrocytes to explore the potential role of cAMP-activated and other protein kinase systems in desensitizing the adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic receptor. Desensitization by the agonist isoproterenol required more than simple occupancy of the receptor by the agonist since under conditions where adenylate cyclase was not activated, no desensitization occurred. As in whole cells, addition of cyclic nucleotides to the cell lysate produced only approximately 50% of the maximal isoproterenol-induced desensitization obtainable. Addition of the purified cAMP-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme plus isoproterenol to isolated turkey erythrocyte plasma membranes mimicked the submaximal desensitization induced in lysates by cAMP. This effect was entirely blocked by the specific inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. By contrast, maximal desensitization induced in lysates by isoproterenol was only approximately 50% attenuated by the protein kinase inhibitor. In the lysate preparations, isoproterenol was also shown to induce, in a stereospecific fashion, phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor. Phosphorylation promoted by isoproterenol was attenuated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor to the same extent as desensitization (i.e. approximately 50%). Phorbol diesters also promoted receptor desensitization and phosphorylation in cell lysates. The desensitization was mimicked by incubation of isolated turkey erythrocyte membranes with partially purified preparations of protein kinase C plus phorbol diesters. In the cell lysate, calmodulin also promoted receptor phosphorylation and desensitization which was blocked by EGTA. Desensitization of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol, phorbol diesters, and calmodulin was not observed to be additive. These findings suggest that: (a) multiple protein kinase systems, including cAMP-dependent, protein kinase C-dependent, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases, are capable of regulating beta-adrenergic receptor function via phosphorylation reactions and that (b) cAMP may not be the sole mediator of isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation and desensitization in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1587832347,"Treatment of Leydig cells with 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP for 48 h decreased microsomal cytochrome P-450 activities, 17 alpha-hydroxylase and C17-20 lyase, by 60-75% and resulted in desensitization of the steroidogenic response. Reduction of the oxygen tension from 19 to 1% O2 prevented the decrease in P-450 activities but not the reduction in steroidogenic capacity. The decrease in activity was also prevented by blocking steroid synthesis with aminoglutethimide. Treatment of cultures with steroid products, androstenedione or testosterone, or product analogs, epitestosterone or 17 alpha-methyltestosterone, at a concentration of 2 microM, which is equivalent to the concentration of testosterone resulting from stimulation with cAMP, also caused oxygen tension-sensitive decreases in hydroxylase activity. Treatment of cultures with 2 microM cortisol, estradiol, or methyltrienolone, an androgen receptor agonist, did not decrease hydroxylase activity, nor did treatment with an androgen receptor antagonist prevent the cAMP- or testosterone-induced decreases in hydroxylase activity. Reductions in hydroxylase and lyase activities resulting from testosterone- or epitestosterone-treatment had little or no effect on acute cAMP-stimulated testosterone production, whereas desensitization with cAMP caused an 80-90% reduction in steroidogenic capacity. 22R-Hydroxycholesterol-supported testosterone synthesis was decreased by both cAMP- and steroid-treatment at 19% O2, but not below the cAMP-stimulated level. Reduction of the oxygen tension partially prevented this decrease. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the decline in microsomal P-450 enzymes in desensitized Leydig cells results from product (pseudosubstrate)-induced, oxygen-derived, free-radical damage rather than a steroid receptor-mediated process."

https://openalex.org/W1650752887,"Recent studies with viral oncogene tyrosine kinases have suggested that these kinases may phosphorylate phosphoinositides and diacylglycerol. Since the receptors for insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) also possess tyrosine kinase activity, we have investigated possible effects of insulin and EGF on phosphoinositide metabolism in rat liver plasma membranes and rat hepatocytes. In plasma membranes prepared from rats injected 18 h prior with [3H]myo-inositol or incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, phosphatidylinositol-4-P and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-P2 were formed, but there were no effects of either insulin or EGF although these agents stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation. In hepatocytes incubated with [3H]myo-inositol, label was incorporated into phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol-4-P, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-P2, but there was no effect of insulin. Incubation of hepatocytes with [3H]myo-inositol plus insulin or EGF for 2 h also did not alter the formation of [3H]myo-inositol-1,4,5-P3 from [3H]phosphatidylinositol-4,5-P2 induced by vasopressin. These findings suggest that the tyrosine kinase activity of liver insulin and EGF receptors is not important in phosphoinositide formation."
https://openalex.org/W1558300419,"We have recently identified a cell surface cAMP-binding protein by specific photoaffinity labeling of intact Dictyostelium discoideum cells with 8-N3-[32P] cAMP. The major photolabeled protein appears as a doublet (Mr = 40,000-43,000) in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis autoradiography. In this study, the doublet is shown to have the characteristics of the cAMP receptor responsible for chemotaxis and cAMP signaling. Both specific photoaffinity labeling of the doublet and binding of 8-N3-[32P]cAMP are saturable (KD = 0.3 microM), the levels of both peak at 5 h, and both are inhibited by cAMP and several cAMP analogs in the same order of potency and with K1 values similar to those measured for inhibition of [3H]cAMP binding. When cAMP-binding activity was partially purified (40-fold) and then photoaffinity labeled, the same bands (Mr = 40,000-43,000) were observed. The relative intensities of the upper and lower bands of the doublet alternated at the same frequency as the spontaneous oscillations in cAMP synthesis. When oscillations were suppressed, the lower band of the doublet predominated. Following addition of cAMP, the relative intensity gradually shifted to the upper band. When cAMP was removed, there was a gradual restoration of the lower band form. We propose that the lower band form of the receptor activates chemotaxis and cAMP signaling and that the upper band form does not. This reversible receptor modification may then be the mechanism of adaptation, the process by which the physiological responses cease to be stimulated by persistent cAMP. Several developmentally regulated genes in D. discoideum have been reported to be induced or suppressed by pulses of cAMP (adaptive regulation) and others by continuous cAMP (nonadaptive regulation). These observations may be explained by the receptor modification reported here if the two forms of the receptor, which bind cAMP with the same affinity, independently influence gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2111811326,"Abstract Two approaches have been used to study the allosteric modulation of phosphofructokinase at physiological concentration of enzyme; a slow motion approach based on the use of a very low Mg2+/ATP ratio to conveniently lower Vmax, and the addition of polyethylene glycol as a crowding agent to favor aggregation of diluted enzyme. At 0.6 mg/ml muscle phosphofructokinase exhibited a drastic decrease in the ATP inhibition and the concomitant increase in the apparent affinity for fructose-6-P, as compared to a 100-fold diluted enzyme. Similar results were obtained with diluted enzyme in the presence of 10% polyethylene glycol (Mr = 6000). Results with these two approaches in vitro were essentially similar to those previously observed in situ (Aragon, J. J., Feliu, F. E., Frenkel, R., and Sols, A. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 6324-6328), indicating that the enzyme is strongly dependent on homologous interactions at physiological concentrations. With polyethylene glycol it was observed that within the physiological range of concentration of substrates and the other positive effectors, fructose-2,6-P2 still activates the liver phosphofructokinase although it no longer significantly affects the muscle isozyme. In the presence of polyethylene glycol, muscle phosphofructokinase can approach its maximal rate even in the presence of physiologically high concentrations of ATP. Three minor activities of muscle phosphofructokinase have been studied at high enzyme concentration: the hydrolysis of MgATP (ATPase) and fructose-1,6-P2 (FBPase), produced in the absence of the other substrate, and the reverse reaction from MgADP and fructose-1,6-P2. The kinetic study of these activities has allowed a new insight into the mechanisms involved in the modulation of phosphofructokinase activity. The binding of (Mg)ATP at its regulatory site reduces the ability of the enzyme to cleave the bond of the terminal phosphate of MgATP at the substrate site. The positive effectors (Pi, cAMP, NH+4, fructose-1,6-P2, and fructose-2,6-P2) decrease the inhibitory effect of MgATP. Citrate and fructose-2,6-P2 both act as mechanistically secondary effectors in the sense that citrate does not inhibit and fructose-2,6-P2 does not activate the FBPase activity, requiring both the presence of ATP to affect the enzyme activity. In conclusion it appears that the regulatory behavior of mammalian phosphofructokinases is utterly dependent on the fact of their high concentrations in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2055700564,Rous sarcoma virus expresses a transcriptional activator that affects the LTR as well as other promoters. We discern this activity as a stimulation of the transient expression of an LTR-promoted hybrid transcriptional unit and also of the rat preproinsulin II gene in transfected NIH 3T3 cells. We map the activity to an alternate reading frame in the p19-p10 region of the gag gene and identify a mRNA whose spliced structure would direct translation of this reading frame from the Pr76gag initiation codon. This mRNA probably differs from genomic RNA only by the 282 nucleotide splice. The predicted translation product is a 124 residue polypeptide; the first six amino acids arise from gag. The target for the action of this transcriptional modulator at the LTR lies between 111 and 620 nucleotides upstream of the cap site.

https://openalex.org/W1576929448,"Microsomal membranes from A875 human melanoma cells contain nerve growth factor receptors (NGF-receptors) which appear to belong to a single class with homogeneous binding properties, as determined by Scatchard plots. NGF-receptors in these membrane preparations are also uniformly highly sensitive to tryptic proteolysis, and 125I-NGF bound to NGF-receptor in these membranes is rapidly dissociated in the presence of a high concentration of unlabeled NGF. However, analysis of 125I-NGF dissociation kinetics indicated that two classes of NGF-receptor were present in these membranes. Thus, NGF-receptors can express either high or low affinity trypsin-sensitive states in addition to the high affinity trypsin resistant NGF-receptor state described previously (Buxser, S. E., Kelleher, D. J., Watson, L., Puma, P., and Johnson, G. L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3741-3749). The high affinity trypsin-sensitive and low affinity trypsin-sensitive states correlate with 200- and 90-kDa 125I-NGF X NGF-receptor complexes observed in photoaffinity cross-linking experiments. The absence of differences in peptide maps generated from the two sizes of NGF-receptor proteins together with structural and binding data strongly indicates that the 200-kDa NGF-receptor protein is a complex, probably a dimer, consisting of two 80-kDa NGF-receptor proteins associated with a single beta-NGF dimeric molecule. A model is proposed which relates structural states of NGF-receptors with specific receptor binding properties. The model provides an alternative explanation for binding phenomena previously attributed to negative cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W1846043808,"The effects of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) on 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity and cytochrome P-450(17 alpha) synthesis have been studied utilizing bovine adrenocortical cells in primary monolayer culture. A 20-fold stimulation of the conversion of pregnenolone to 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone was observed in postmitochondrial supernatant fractions from cells treated with ACTH as compared to controls. This increase in 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity was found to be due to a change in the Vmax and not a change in the Km(app). By immunoisolation of newly synthesized protein from an RNA-directed cell-free translation system we found that the level of P-450(17 alpha) was many-fold greater when RNA from ACTH-stimulated cells was used, as compared to RNA from control cells. A similar pattern was obtained when the rate of P-450(17 alpha) synthesis was analyzed by immunoisolation from radiolabeled cellular protein from ACTH-stimulated cells. When the total amount of P-450(17 alpha) was measured by immunoblotting we found that the levels of enzyme present correlated with the 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity. In addition, we found that these ACTH-mediated effects could be mimicked by treatment of cells with analogs of cyclic AMP. These results indicate that the activity of P-450(17 alpha) is regulated primarily by cyclic AMP-mediated changes in synthesis, probably at the transcriptional level, which in turn has a profound effect on the pattern of steroid secretion. Thus, we believe cytochrome P-450(17 alpha) to be a key regulatory enzyme in the steroidogenic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1488546359,"We have demonstrated that physiological concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol increase nuclear estrogen-specific binding sites in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 7- to 10-fold and the rate of accumulation of secreted apolipoprotein C-II (apo-C-II), 2.5-fold (Tam, S-P., Archer, T. K., and Deeley, R. G. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1670-1675). Apo-C-II is the major activator of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme which plays a key role in lipoprotein catabolism. In order to define more precisely the mechanism by which estrogen influences apo-C-II production, we have synthesized a triacontanucleotide DNA probe that is complementary to apo-C-II mRNA. We have used the probe both in Northern hybridization experiments and in DNA excess titrations to quantify apo-C-II mRNA in hormonally treated HepG2 cells and various primate tissues. These studies revealed that: 1) the concentration of apo-C-II mRNA in HepG2 cells is comparable with that present in human liver; 2) treatment of the cells with low levels of estrogen results in a doubling of the apo-C-II mRNA concentration; 3) the apo-C-II mRNA concentration in monkey liver is 60- to 70-fold greater than in the intestine and 2.5-fold higher than in human liver."
https://openalex.org/W1600621214,"This report provides a characterization of the effects of varying the concentrations of Mg2+, ATP, phosphorylase kinase, and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase on the activation and phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase. The results show the following. (a) The Km for MgATP2- for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation is decreased by increasing Mg2+, probably as a consequence of decreasing the free ATP:MgATP2- ratio and increasing free Mg2+. (b) Whereas beta subunit phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase plays a prominent role in determining its activity, alpha subunit phosphorylation can also modulate activity. (c) The phosphorylation of the alpha subunit, which occurs following the initial cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the beta subunit, is catalyzed by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is not a consequence of EGTA-insensitive (or EGTA-sensitive) autophosphorylation occurring as a result of the enhanced phosphorylase kinase activity. (d) The relationship between subunit phosphorylation and phosphorylase kinase activation is complex and particularly dependent upon concentrations of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylase kinase in the activation reaction. The data suggest the possibilities that the pathway of phospho-intermediates involved in the activation process probably varies with the activation conditions, that the efficacy of a specific site to be covalently modified is dependent upon the phosphorylation status of other sites, and that the effect of phosphorylation in regulating activity may also be dependent on the phosphorylation status of other sites. It is clear from the data that the activation process for phosphorylase kinase can be very complex, and it is possible that this complexity might have significant physiological ramifications."

The Mr = 66,000 and 68,000 proteins chased into the Mr = 74,000 and 82,000 proteins in pulse-chase experiments. The Mr = 68,000 and 82,000 proteins were found to be phosphorylated primarily on serine and threonine residues and contained minor amounts of phosphotyrosine. Tryptic peptide analysis of these phosphoproteins revealed several major peptides, and treatment of cells with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate resulted in the appearance of an additional phosphopeptide. 12-O-Tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate also inhibited growth of AEV-C23 cells in soft agar and in monolayer culture. In vitro phosphorylation of Mr = 68,000 and 74,000 proteins in immunoprecipitates occurred on tyrosine with lesser amounts of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine detected."
https://openalex.org/W2029758292,"Since the liver is a central organ for lipid and lipoprotein synthesis and catabolism, hepatic receptors for specific apolipoproteins on plasma lipoproteins would be expected to modulate lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The role of hepatic receptors for low density lipoproteins and apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins was evaluated in patients with complementary disorders in lipoprotein metabolism: abetalipoproteinemia and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In addition, hepatic membranes from a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia were studied and compared before and after portacaval shunt surgery. The results establish that the human liver has receptors for apolipoproteins B and E. Furthermore, in the human, hepatic receptors for low density lipoproteins and apolipoprotein E are genetically distinct and can undergo independent control."

https://openalex.org/W1503690334,"Certain products of cultured rabbit corneal epithelium or epidermis regulate collagenase production by rabbit corneal stromal cells. Here, we examined the effects of a 20-kDa cytokine derived from cultured epithelium on collagenase expression by normal human skin fibroblasts and by cells from recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a disease characterized by over-production of a structurally altered collagenase. Culturing cells for 24 h in the presence of the cytokine resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in trypsin-activatable collagenase activity paralleled by an increase in immunoreactive protein, suggesting enhanced synthesis. There was no change in the activity/immunoreactive protein, indicating a catalytically unaltered enzyme. In kinetic studies, stimulation of collagenase synthesis was first observed approximately 8 h after exposure to the epidermal cytokine. Conversely, when cells were primed with cytokine for 24 h and the stimulator was then removed, an increased rate of synthesis was seen for an additional approximately 9 h, after which the rate reverted to control levels. Since the kinetic data suggested an effect at a pretranslational level, fibroblasts cultured with 20-kDa stimulator were used to prepare mRNA. In cell-free translation total protein synthesis was unaltered; however, the cytokine caused a greater than 2-fold increase in translatable collagenase mRNA. The data suggest that this epithelial cytokine specifically modulates collagenase synthesis through transcription and that epithelial-stromal interactions are important to cutaneous connective tissue metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2105004899,"In this study, large numbers of hybridomas (produced by syngeneic immunization with B16 mouse melanoma and fusion with NS-1 myeloma cells) were screened for the production of antibodies that affected morphology and growth of animal and human tumor cells in vitro. Two such antibodies, NORM-1 and NORM-2 (both IgG2a), inhibited the growth of B16 melanoma cells in soft agar and increased the serum requirements of tumor cells in tissue culture. Antibody NORM-2 also inhibited the growth of SV40-transformed 3T3 cells in agar and caused them to deposit more fibronectin into extracellular matrix. These antibodies thus seem to induce a more normal behavior of tumor cells in vitro. In vivo both antibodies reduced the number of growing lung tumors of B16 melanoma in C57BL/6 mice by 70%-90% when injected 3 days after the tumor cells. By immunoprecipitation of 35S-methionine-labeled cell extracts, NORM-2 antibody recognized a 59 kd protein in B16 mouse and in A375 human melanoma cells but not in 3T3 fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1584099943,"Rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (synthase a) can be phosphorylated by 0.2 to 2.5 microM catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase to a stoichiometry of 1.5 to 3 mol of 32PO4/subunit (90,000 X g). When a complete tryptic digest of this 32P-synthase was chromatographed on reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, it was observed that, in addition to sites 1a, 1b, and 2, site 3 was phosphorylated. The peptide containing site 5 also contained 32PO4, but sequence analysis identified a new phosphorylation site, site 4 (Arg-His-Ser-Ser(PO4)-) which precedes site 5. Phosphorylation of sites 3 and 4 became significant when the total phosphorylation stoichiometry exceeded 1.5 mol/subunit. The heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor protein or the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase decreased the phosphorylation of all sites, including sites 3 and 4. Phosphorylation of all sites by the holoenzyme form of cAMP-dependent kinase was highly dependent on the presence of cAMP. These results establish that phosphorylation of these sites is due to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase itself and not to a contaminating kinase(s). Synthase b from control rabbit muscle, containing 2 to 2.5 mol of phosphate/subunit, incorporated up to 2.0 mol of 32PO4 catalyzed in vitro by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Again, significant 32PO4 was detected in sites 3 and 4 as well as in 1a, 1b, and 2. These results suggest that the in vivo phosphorylation of sites 1a, 1b, 2, and 3 observed after injection of epinephrine in rabbits could be due solely to the known activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1586364338,"Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analyses of immunoprecipitates of HLA-D region antigens prepared from [35S]methionine-labeled B lymphoblastoid cells revealed a number of invariant polypeptides (Ii and theta) that co-precipitate with the alpha and beta polypeptides of the class II (Ia) antigens. The invariant polypeptides comprised at least three Ii spots of Mr = 31,000 (Ii1-Ii3) and a series of six theta spots of Mr = 34,000 (theta 1-theta 6). The structural inter-relationships of these polypeptides have been investigated. Tryptic peptide fingerprints showed that Ii and theta have closely related amino acid sequences. In contrast, the fingerprints of the HLA-DR alpha and beta polypeptides clearly differed from those of theta and Ii as well as from each other. Analyses of immunoprecipitates prepared from cells cultured in the presence of tunicamycin revealed the presence of two N-linked oligosaccharides on each invariant polypeptide and suggested that the more acidic theta polypeptides (theta 1 and theta 2) differed from the other invariant polypeptides by the presence of sialic acid on one or both N-linked oligosaccharides. Removal of sialic acid by neuraminidase simplified the pattern of theta spots into three distinct Ii-related polypeptides. Endo-beta-N-acetylglycosaminidase H digestion indicated that the individual theta polypeptides represent stages in carbohydrate processing whereby Ii with two N-linked immature oligosaccharides are converted initially to theta 6-theta 3 with one immature and one complex, but nonsialylated, oligosaccharide and finally to theta 2-theta 1 with two complex oligosaccharides. Digestion of the theta polypeptides with N-acetylgalactosamine oligosaccharidase indicated that the theta spots are also derived by O-glycosylation from the Ii polypeptides. This assignment is supported by results obtained using monensin to block glycosylation within the Golgi. At least three spots persisted after complete removal of the N- and O-linked oligosaccharides, suggesting the presence of a family of invariant polypeptides differing in amino acid sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1568083617,"A monoclonal antibody was used to quantitate changes in the extent of phosphorylation of the type II regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in intact bovine tracheal smooth muscle. The autophosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the regulatory subunit (RII) were separated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and identified by immunoblot analysis. Addition of cAMP to tissue extracts resulted in rapid dephosphorylation of RII (t 1/2 = 20s at 4 degrees C) while addition of MgATP caused complete conversion to the phosphorylated form. Under basal conditions, 56% of RII in intact muscle was phosphorylated when the tissue was homogenized under conditions which fully inhibit protein kinase and phosphatase activities. Incubation with isoproterenol caused a dose-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation state of RII (EC50 = 5 X 10(-8) M). Incubation with high concentrations of isoproterenol, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, or forskolin caused maximal decreases in the phosphorylated form to 12-18% of the total RII. The effect of isoproterenol was rapid (t 1/2 = 15 s at 37 degrees C), reversible, and could be blocked with the antagonist propranolol. Contraction of the smooth muscle with K+ or low (less than 1 microM) concentrations of carbachol had no effect on the phosphorylation level. A decrease in the basal phosphorylation level to 41% was observed with 10 microM carbachol which was additive with the dephosphorylation produced by isoproterenol. The time course of isoproterenol-induced dephosphorylation of RII paralleled that of muscle relaxation, consistent with a role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation in relaxation of smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1652661877,"Adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (APS) kinase from Penicillium chrysogenum, loses catalytic activity at temperatures greater than approximately 40 degrees C. When the heat-inactivated enzyme is cooled to 30 degrees C or lower, activity is regained in a time-dependent process. At an intermediary temperature (e.g. 36 degrees C) an equilibrium between active and inactive forms can be demonstrated. APS kinase from P. chrysogenum is a dimer (Mr = 57,000-60,000) composed of two apparently identical subunits. Three lines of evidence suggest that the reversible inactivation is a result of subunit dissociation and reassociation. (a) Inactivation is a first-order process. The half-time for inactivation at a given temperature is independent of the original enzyme concentration. Reactivation follows second-order kinetics. The half-time for reactivation is inversely proportional to the original enzyme concentration. (b) The equilibrium active/inactive ratio at 36 degrees C increases as the total initial enzyme concentration is increased. However, Keq,app at 5 mM MgATP and 36 degrees C calculated as [inactive sites]2/0.5 [active sites] is near-constant at about 1.7 X 10(-8) M over a 10-fold concentration range of enzyme. (c) At 46 degrees C, the inactive P. chrysogenum enzyme (assayed after reactivation) elutes from a calibrated gel filtration column at a position corresponding to Mr = 33,000. Substrates and products of the APS kinase reaction had no detectable effect on the rate of inactivation. However, MgATP and MgADP markedly stimulated the reactivation process (kapp = 3 X 10(5) M-1 X s-1 at 30 degrees C and 10 mM MgATP). The kapp for reactivation was a nearly linear function of MgATP up to about 20 mM suggesting that the monomer has a very low affinity for the nucleotide compared to that of the native dimer. Keq,app at 36 degrees C increases as the MgATP concentration is increased. The inactivation rate constant increased as the pH was decreased but no pK alpha could be determined. The reactivation rate constant increased as the pH was increased. An apparent pK alpha of 6.4 was estimated."
https://openalex.org/W1520649778,"Abstract (E1P) and K+-sensitive (E2P) phosphoenzymes are sequentially formed intermediates in the reaction pathways catalyzed by the Na+,K+- and Ca2+-ATPases. The kinetics of dephosphorylation of these intermediates were examined by means of rapid quenching with acid at 21 degrees C. Under conditions favoring the formation of E2P (25 mM Na+ and O K+), addition of 5 mM ADP + 10 mM EDTA to the Na+,K+-ATPase phosphoenzyme produced a biphasic pattern of dephosphorylation. Both phases of phosphoenzyme decomposition were accompanied by approximately stoichiometric amounts of inorganic phosphate (Pi) release. The rate of decay of the rapid phase was 10 times faster than the rate of phosphoenzyme turnover under phosphorylating conditions indicating acceleration of E2P hydrolysis by ADP. Similar patterns of ADP-stimulated phosphoenzyme decay and Pi release were observed in the Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum phosphorylated at low (0.1 mM) Mg2+ in the absence of KCl. These results demonstrate that ADP can enhance the rate of E2P hydrolysis in the cases of the Na+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase. As a consequence measurement of ADP-sensitive EP may overestimate E1P."
https://openalex.org/W1506453981,"Radiation inactivation with high energy electrons from a linear accelerator was used to determine the functional molecular size of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding site and the tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity in A-431 membranes. The target size of the protein portion of the EGF receptor glycoprotein was 147,000 daltons when the radiation-dependent decrease in maximal binding capacity was measured. Since the target size is in good agreement with the molecular size of the protein portion of the EGF receptor determined by denaturing biochemical methods, it appears that the monomeric receptor is the functional binding site in situ. The target size of the EGF-stimulated kinase activity associated with the affinity-purified EGF receptor/kinase was 133,000 and 144,000 daltons when assayed for the ability to autophosphorylate or to phosphorylate a tyrosine-containing peptide, respectively. However, the target size of the kinase activity that did not adhere to an EGF-affinity column was 54,000 and 69,000 daltons when assayed for phosphorylation of endogenous and exogenous substrates, respectively. Intermediate target sizes were obtained when kinase assays were performed on membranes prior to fractionation by affinity chromatography. These results, taken with other biochemical data, indicate that A-431 membranes contain a kinase activity that is a domain of the glycoprotein that contains the EGF binding site and that the membranes also contain another tyrosine-specific kinase or kinases that have an average size of approximately 60,000 daltons."
