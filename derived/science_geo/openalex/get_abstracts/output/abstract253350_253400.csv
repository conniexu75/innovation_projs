The upstream kinases are also functionally conserved, and the AMPK kinases LKB1 and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase activate Snf1 in mutant yeast cells lacking the native Snf1-activating kinases, Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1. Here, we exploited the yeast genetic system to identify members of the mammalian AMPK kinase family by their function as Snf1-activating kinases. A mouse embryo cDNA library in a yeast expression vector was used to transform sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ yeast cells. Selection for a Snf+ growth phenotype yielded cDNA plasmids expressing LKB1, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase, and transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase (TAK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family. We present genetic and biochemical evidence that TAK1 activates Snf1 protein kinase in vivo and in vitro. We further show that recombinant TAK1, fused to the activation domain of its binding partner TAB1, phosphorylates Thr-172 in the activation loop of the AMPK catalytic domain. Finally, expression of TAK1 and TAB1 in HeLa cells or treatment of cells with cytokines stimulated phosphorylation of Thr-172 of AMPK. These findings indicate that TAK1 is a functional member of the Snf1/AMPK kinase family and support TAK1 as a candidate for an authentic AMPK kinase in mammalian cells.

In mammalian cells, reduced energy availability (high cellular AMP:ATP ratio) causes activation of AMPK, which promotes glucose transport and ATP-generating metabolic processes, inhibits ATP-consuming processes, and regulates transcription. AMPK is also regulated by leptin, adiponectin, and ghrelin (3Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B.

Snf1 protein kinase, like AMPK, is heterotrimeric, comprising a catalytic subunit (Snf1/α), and two regulatory subunits (β and Snf4/γ). Mutation of SNF1 causes the Snf– (sucrose-nonfermenting) phenotype, which is characterized by inability to utilize carbon sources that are less preferred than glucose. Like AMPK, Snf1 protein kinase regulates transcription, metabolic enzymes, and transporters in response to stress, particularly carbon stress (reviewed in Refs. 11Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar and 12Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar).The Snf1/AMPK-activating kinases in the kinase cascade are also highly conserved between yeast and mammals (Fig. 1). Yeast contains three homologous kinases that phosphorylate the activation loop Thr-210 of the Snf1 catalytic subunit: Sak1 (Snf1-activating kinase, previously Pak1), Tos3, and Elm1 (13Hong S.-P.

Mutant yeast cells lacking these three kinases (sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ cells) cannot activate Snf1 and exhibit a Snf– phenotype (13Hong S.-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Tos3 and Elm1 phosphorylate and activate AMPK in vitro (13Hong S.-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 15Sutherland C.M. Hawley S.A. McCartney R.R. Leech A. Stark M.J. Schmidt M.C. Hardie D.G. Curr.

LKB1, in complex with its partners STRADα and MO25α, and CaMKK phosphorylate Snf1 in vitro and activate Snf1 in sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ mutant yeast, conferring a Snf+ growth phenotype (16Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Carlson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21804-21809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Woods A. Dickerson K. Heath R. Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Johnstone S.R. Carlson M. Carling D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar).Here, we took advantage of this conservation of the Snf1/AMPK pathway and exploited the yeast genetic system in an effort to identify new members of the AMPK kinase family. Given that yeast, a simple unicellular organism, has three Snf1 protein kinase kinases, it seems likely that mammals have multiple AMPK kinases. The heterologous function of LKB1 and CaMKK in yeast provides the basis for a convenient and powerful genetic selection for mammalian AMPK kinases: the restoration of the Snf+ growth phenotype in sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ mutant yeast. The power of this selection lies not only in its simplicity but also in its sensitivity. The Snf1 pathway is robust, and very little activity is required for growth; for example, expression of LKB1 alone restores growth despite causing only a modest elevation of Snf1 catalytic activity (16Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Carlson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21804-21809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This sensitivity is important because the catalytic subunit of an AMPK kinase must function in yeast without other mammalian proteins, either alone or in association with yeast orthologs.We have transformed sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ yeast cells with a mouse embryo cDNA library in a yeast expression vector and selected for cDNAs that confer the Snf+ growth phenotype. This genetic selection yielded clones encoding two authentic AMPK kinases, LKB1 and CaMKKβ, and also transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-activated kinase (TAK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family. TAK1 was identified as a mediator of TGF-β signaling in mammalian cells (23Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) and was shown to participate in bone morphogenetic protein signaling in Xenopus development (24Shibuya H. Iwata H. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Ueno N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). TAK1 is also activated by the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) and by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and regulates IκB kinase (IKK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK pathways (25Shirakabe K.

Synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking appropriate supplements was used to select for plasmids.Selection for Mammalian Snf1-activating Kinases in Yeast—DNA of a two-hybrid library prepared from mouse 17-day embryo cDNAs in a yeast expression plasmid vector carrying the LEU2 marker (Clontech catalog number 638846) was used to transform (36Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar) yeast strain MCY5138 (see Fig. 2). A total of 5 × 106 transformants were selected on 500 plates of SC solid medium containing 2% glucose and lacking leucine. Colonies from each plate were resuspended in SC medium and transferred to a fresh plate of SC-leucine solid medium containing 2% raffinose plus the respiratory inhibitor antimycin A (1 μg/ml). Growth on this medium requires activation of Snf1 protein kinase; in control experiments, colonies expressing LKB1 appeared in 3–7 days. After 5–7 days, two colonies from each plate were picked and retested for growth. Plasmid DNAs were rescued by passage through bacteria, retested by transformation of MCY5138, and sequenced. One plasmid was saved from each plate.FIGURE 2Strategy for identification of mammalian Snf1-activating kinases in yeast.

His-tagged recombinant human TAK1-TAB1 fusion protein (100 ng; Upstate catalog number 14-600) was incubated with substrates and cold ATP.Analysis of Phosphorylation of AMPK in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were transfected with DNAs (8 μg/6-cm dish) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TNF-α and IL-1β were purchased from R&D Systems. Cells were lysed by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer as described (20Woods A. Dickerson K. Heath R. Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Johnstone S.R. Carlson M. Carling D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), except without prior rinsing. Lysates were collected immediately and clarified by brief centrifugation in the cold.RESULTSGenetic Selection for Mammalian Snf1-activating Kinases in Yeast—The sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ mutant yeast strain lacks all three native Snf1 protein kinase kinases and therefore exhibits the Snf– (sucrose-nonfermenting) phenotype, which is characterized by the ability to utilize glucose but not alternative carbon sources. To identify mammalian Snf1-activating kinases, and thus candidates for AMPK kinases, we selected mammalian cDNAs that allow sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ cells to grow on raffinose, as shown schematically in Fig. 2. We used a library of mouse 17-day embryo cDNAs fused to the Gal4 activation domain (GAD) in a yeast expression vector to transform sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ yeast cells and then selected for growth on raffinose. We recovered the cDNA plasmid from Snf+ colonies by passage through Escherichia coli, retransformed sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ yeast cells to confirm that the cDNA conferred a Snf+ phenotype, and identified the cDNA by sequencing. In a screen of 5 × 106 transformants, we recovered 49 cDNA clones expressing LKB1, five expressing CaMKKβ, and six expressing TAK1, also known as MAPKKK7 (23Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). This selection also yielded seven cDNAs expressing transcription factors, which were not characterized further, but none expressing CaMKKα, which we previously showed to function in yeast (Ref. 16Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Carlson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21804-21809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar; see Fig. 3B). The recovery of LKB1 and CaMKKβ, which are both known AMPK kinases, validates this approach. TAK1 is thus a candidate for a Snf1-activating kinase and potentially an AMPK kinase.FIGURE 3Growth of mutant yeast cells expressing TAK1. Cultures expressing the indicated proteins were spotted with serial 5-fold dilutions on selective SC medium containing 2% glucose, 2% raffinose and the respiratory inhibitor antimycin A (1 μg/ml), or 2% glycerol plus 3% ethanol. Plates were incubated at 30 °C and were photographed after 3 days, or after 6 days for raffinose plates. A, snf1Δ10 cells expressed GAD-Snf1, GAD-TAK1, or GAD (vector). B and C, sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ cells expressed HA-CaMKKα, HA-TAK1, HA-TAK1K63W, HA-Sak1, or HA (vector) and either LexA-TAB1 or LexA (vector). Additional transformants expressing TAK1 and TAB1 and transformants expressing TAK1K63W from three independent mutant plasmids were tested on raffinose with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Growth Phenotype Conferred by TAK1 Requires Snf1 Protein Kinase—We first sought to confirm that the ability of TAK1 to confer growth on raffinose requires Snf1 protein kinase. A cDNA plasmid expressing GAD-TAK1 was used to transform snf1Δ mutant cells. The transformants did not grow on raffinose (Fig. 3A), indicating that TAK1 requires Snf1 protein kinase to confer a Snf+ phenotype and does not function by bypassing Snf1. In control experiments, expression of Snf1 in the mutant cells restored growth, as expected.The cDNA clones recovered from the library expressed TAK1 with GAD fused to its N terminus. To exclude the possibility that this fusion protein had aberrant function, we expressed full-length TAK1, tagged with a triple-HA epitope at its N terminus, from the yeast ADH1 promoter of vector pWS93. Expression of this HA-tagged TAK1 allowed sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ cells to grow on raffinose (Fig. 3B) and on glycerol plus ethanol (Fig. 3C); HA-TAK1 was used in all subsequent experiments. TAB1, a TAK1-binding protein identified in the two-hybrid system, increases the catalytic activity of TAK1 (33Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar); however, TAK1 acts independently of TAB1 in some signaling pathways in mammalian cells (44Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Coexpression of LexA-TAB1 from the ADH1 promoter did not improve growth of sak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ cells on raffinose (Fig. 3B), although some improvement was noted on glycerol-ethanol (Fig. 3C); expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown and Fig. 4C). In addition, TAK1, with or without TAB1, did not allow raffinose utilization by snf1Δ cells expressing mutant Snf1T210A with the activation loop Thr-210 replaced by Ala, as predicted if TAK1 functions by phosphorylating Thr-210 (data not shown).FIGURE 4Assays of Snf1 catalytic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2093457368,"NF-κB/Rel is a family of transcription factors whose activation has long been linked to the production of inflammatory cytokines. Here, we studied NF-κB signaling in the regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10). We identified a role for a single NF-κB family member, NF-κB1 (p50), in promoting the transcription of IL-10. The NF-κB ciselement on IL-10 proximal promoter was located to –55/–46, where p50 can homodimerize and form a complex with the transcriptional co-activator CREB-binding protein to activate transcription. The other Rel family members appear to play a negligible role in IL-10 transcription. Mice lacking p50 were more susceptible to lethal endotoxemia, and macrophages taken from p50–/– mice exhibit skewed cytokine responses to lipopolysaccharide, characterized by decreased IL-10 and increased tumor necrosis factor and IL-12. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that NF-κB1 (p50) homodimers can be transcriptional activators of IL-10. The reciprocal regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production by NF-κB1 (p50) may provide potential new ways to manipulate the innate immune response.

The reciprocal regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production by NF-κB1 (p50) may provide potential new ways to manipulate the innate immune response. Macrophages are on the first line of host defense. In response to infections with microbes or exposure to pathogen-derived products, these cells undergo a series of physiological changes that can collectively be called an activation response. Activated macrophages are more adept at killing intracellular pathogens, and they exhibit dramatic alterations in both the quantity and quality of secreted products. These cells are an important source of inflammatory cytokines, and the production of these cytokines is an important component of host defense (1Kawai T. Akira S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The dysregulated overproduction of these cytokines, however, can contribute to autoimmune pathologies, such as those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis (2Fujiwara N. Kobayashi K. Curr. Drug Targets. Inflamm. Allergy. 2005; 4: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). One of the ways that macrophages control the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines is to produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; Bcl-3, B-cell CLL/lymphoma 3; BMMϕ, bone marrow-derived macrophage; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; C/EBP, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; p105sr, p105-based NF-κB super suppressor; p300, E1A-binding protein p300; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. IL-10 is a Class II α-helical cytokine, and the founding member of a growing family of structurally related cytokines, including IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26 (3Fickenscher H. Hor S. Kupers H. Knappe A. Wittmann S. Sticht H. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). IL-10 has well documented immune inhibitory capacity. IL-10 was originally called “cytokine synthesis inhibiting factor,” because it can inhibit the transcription and translation of a variety of inflammatory cytokines (4Conti P. Kempuraj D. Frydas S. Kandere K. Boucher W. Letourneau R. Madhappan B. Sagimoto K. Christodoulou S. Theoharides T.C. Immunol. Lett. 2003; 88: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). IL-10 reduces antigen presentation and either inhibits (5Grutz G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2005; 77: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) or biases (6Anderson C.F. Mosser D.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3697-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) T-cell activation. The administration of exogenous IL-10 to macrophages can render them refractory to interferon-γ (7Kane M.M. Mosser D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and diminish their responses to LPS (8Berg D.J. Kuhn R. Rajewsky K. Muller W. Menon S. Davidson N. Grunig G. Rennick D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2339-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The well described immunomodulatory activities of IL-10 have resulted in a number of clinical trials using recombinant cytokine to ameliorate autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, etc. (9Moore K.W. de Waal M.R. Coffman R.L. O'Garra A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 683-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (5361) Google Scholar). Several pathogens, including Leishmania (10Miles S.A. Conrad S.M. Alves R.G. Jeronimo S.M. Mosser D.M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), Vaccinia virus (11Maloney G. Schroder M. Bowie A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30838-30844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and Mycobacteria (12Bleharski J.R. Li H. Meinken C. Graeber T.G. Ochoa M.T. Yamamura M. Burdick A. Sarno E.N. Wagner M. Rollinghoff M. Rea T.H. Colonna M. Stenger S. Bloom B.R. Eisenberg D. Modlin R.L. Science. 2003; 301: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), exploit the immunosuppressive activity of IL-10 to establish infection. One of the paradoxes about the regulation of IL-10 production by macrophages is that the stimuli used to induce inflammatory cytokine production are often the same stimuli that induce IL-10. Only recently have studies begun to reveal how these divergent families of cytokines can be produced in response to similar stimuli. Recent studies have demonstrated that the control of IL-10 biosynthesis depends not only on the activation of transcription factors, but also on covalent modifications to the histones associated with the IL-10 promoter. These modifications render the IL-10 promoter accessible to the transcription factors that bind there (13Lucas M. Zhang X. Prasanna V. Mosser D.M. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Among the several transcription factors that have been implicated in IL-10 transcription, Sp1 appears to play a dominant role (14Brightbill H.D. Plevy S.E. Modlin R.L. Smale S.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1940-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and several C/EBP binding sites have also been identified (15Liu Y.W. Tseng H.P. Chen L.C. Chen B.K. Chang W.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Stat 3 (16Benkhart E.M. Siedlar M. Wedel A. Werner T. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1612-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), c-Maf (17Cao S. Liu J. Song L. Ma X. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3484-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and NF-Y transcription factors (18Lin S.C. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 43: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have also been shown to bind to the human IL-10 promoter. To date, there has been no definitive evidence to support a role for NF-κB in the transcriptional control of IL-10 biosynthesis, although its role in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines is well recognized (19Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a family of transcription factors that includes RelA (p65), NF-κB1 (p50 and p105), NF-κB2 (p52 and p100), c-Rel, and RelB. These transcription factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκBs, which prevent NF-κB activation (20Tergaonkar V. Correa R.G. Ikawa M. Verma I.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and inhibit nuclear accumulation (21Johnson C. Van A.D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The degradation of IκBs facilitates the migration of NF-κB into the nucleus, where they typically form heterodimers that bind to the promoters of many immune response genes and activate transcription (reviewed in Ref. 19Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar). Prototypical activators of NF-κB are the ligands for the toll-like receptors, which have been well described and studied (reviewed in Ref. 22Kaisho T. Akira S. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 393-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB/Rel family members RelA, RelB, and c-Rel have a C-terminal transactivation domain. In contrast to these members, p50 lacks a transactivation domain and, therefore, usually forms a heterodimer to be transcriptionally active (19Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar, 23Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). p50 homodimers, which retain their ability to bind to NF-κB sites, are thought to be transcriptional repressors (24May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). However, in vitro studies have shown that p50 can associate with other transcriptional activators, such as Bcl-3 (25Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) or p300 (26Deng W.G. Wu K.K. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6581-6588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), to activate transcription. A number of immune response genes have NF-κB binding element(s) in their promoters, and in fact the constitutive activation of NF-κB pathways is associated with a variety of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (23Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 may cooperate with NF-κB and help to determine the specificity of NF-κB-driven gene expression (27Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In the present study we examine the role of NF-κB in driving IL-10 transcription and highlight the importance of a single Rel family member, p50, in promoting the production of IL-10. Animal Care and Use—Normal BALB/c mice were used for the isolation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMϕ). They were purchased from Takonic (Germantown, NY) and used at 6–8 weeks. NF-κB1 (p50) knock-out mice (B6;129P2-Nfkb1tm1Bal/J) and their wild-type control mice; Bcl-3 knockout mice (129;FVB-Bcl3tm1Ver) and their controls were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were maintained in high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered Thoren units (Thoren Caging System) at the University of Maryland (College Park, MD). All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland.

The murine Bcl-3 (GenBank™ NM_033601) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into pCDNA3.1 vector and sequenced. Cytokines and Reagents—LPS from Escherichia coli serotype O127:B8 was purchased from Sigma. Ultrapure LPS from E. coli 0111:B4, and Pam2CSK4, and Pam3CSK4 were purchased from Invitrogen. Recombinant mouse interferon-γ was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human NF-κBp50 protein was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Cells and Cell Culture—The macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cell line was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages were generated as previously described (6Anderson C.F. Mosser D.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3697-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Transient transfections in bone marrow-derived macrophages was accomplished by the nucleofection technique (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD), as previously described (13Lucas M. Zhang X. Prasanna V. Mosser D.M. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), using the cell line kit T and the U20 program. A pmaxGFP vector was used to monitor the transfection efficiency by flow cytometry. 24 h after transfection, transfected cells were treated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 16 h at which time the supernatants were collected and analyzed by ELISA. RAW 264.7 cell transient transfection and luciferase assays were performed as described before (17Cao S. Liu J. Song L. Ma X. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3484-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). ELISA—Cytokine secretion by stimulated macrophages was determined by ELISA as previously described (36Sutterwala F.S. Noel G.J. Salgame P. Mosser D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) using the following antibody pairs: IL-12p40/70, C15.6 and C17.8; IL-10, JES5–2A5 and JES5–16E3; and TNF-α, G281–2626 and MP-XT3. All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Nuclear Extraction and Western Blotting—Nuclear extracts were prepared from stimulated macrophages as described previously (37Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, 800 μg of nuclear extract was isolated from 2-h LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. Extracts were pre-cleared by the addition of 1 μg of rabbit IgG and protein G plus-agarose preincubated with 10% fetal bovine serum. The pre-cleared extracts were then incubated with rabbit anti-CBP antibody or normal rabbit IgG and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted by using 1× SDS-PAGE buffer, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. In Vivo Responses to Endotoxin—To determine endotoxin sensitivity, both the NF-κB1 knock-out and wild-type control mice were injected intraperitoneally with E. coli LPS serotype 0127:B8 at a concentration of 6.7 mg/kg body weight. This amount of LPS was selected as two-thirds of the lethal dose of LPS, which was pre-titrated in wild-type mice. For lethal endotoxicity determinations, age- and weight-matched female mice were injected with LPS and monitored at 8 h intervals. For the in vivo cytokine production, blood was obtained from the post-orbital vein complex at 1, 2, and 5 h after LPS challenge. Mice were euthanized immediately after the last bleed. Cytokine levels in serum were determined by ELISA. Mammalian Two-hybrid Technique—The Check-Mate Mammalian Two-Hybrid System (Promega) was employed. The intact murine NF-κB1(p50) gene (GenBank™ NM_008689) (19Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar, 23Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar) was amplified, sequenced, and cloned in-frame into the pBIND vector, which contains the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The murine CREB-binding protein (CBP) (Gene bank NM_001025432) full-length (amino acids 1–2441), and C-terminal (amino acids 1758–2441) (38Hiroi M. Ohmori Y. J. Biol.

A luciferase reporter driven by five GAL4 binding sites (pG5-luc) was co-transfected into RAW 264.7 cells, and luciferase activity was measured. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assays were performed following the instructions of the ChIP assay kit (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY). The antibodies used were: α-p50 (SC-7178X), α-p65 (SC-109X), α-c-Rel (SC-71X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and α-CBP(SC-369), which are all demonstrated to be ChIP-grade antibodies (39Liu J.

The primers used to amplify the IL-10 promoter were (–97/+35): sense, 5′-TAGAAGAGGGAGGAGGAGCC-3′; antisense, 5′-TGTGGCTTTGGTAGTGCAAG-3′. The upstream non-related IL-10 promoter region (–1563/–1427) primers were: sense, 5′-CAGTCAGGAGAGAGGGCAGTGA-3′; antisense, 5′-TTTCCAACAGCAGAAGCAAC-3′. The primers for the –4652/–4322 region of the IL-10 promoter are as reported (43Saraiva M. Christensen J.R. Tsytsykova A.V. Goldfeld A.E. Ley S.C. Kioussis D. O'Garra A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The primers for the murine IL-12p35 promoter were 5′-CGACGCACTTGTCCTTGAGAT and 3′-ACTGAGAGGAGCTGCTGGAT to amplify the region of –167/–12 relative to the translation start codon (GenBank™ S82412), which has been demonstrated to contain an NF-κB binding site (44Kollet J.I. Petro T.M. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The thermocycler settings were: 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min; 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min; and 45 cycles at 95 °C, for 15 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 35 s. The PCR products were checked on 1.5% agarose gel to confirm the specificity of amplification. The signal was normalized with the input first and then compared with the normal rabbit IgG signal to calculate the -fold changes and finally plotted with the time 0, which is set as 1, to compute the kinetic changes. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA and supershift assays were performed as previously described (17Cao S. Liu J. Song L. Ma X. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3484-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were: α-p50 (SC-114X), α-p65 (100–4165) (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA), α-c-Rel (SC-70X), and normal rabbit IgG (SC-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The IL-12(p35) oligomer used for EMSA was TCCTGGGAAAGTCCTGCCGG, which contains the –110/–100 NF-κB site as previously reported (44Kollet J.I. Petro T.M. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described (13Lucas M. Zhang X. Prasanna V. Mosser D.M. J.

Statistical Analysis—Student t tests were performed where indicated. For the survival data in Fig. 8D, a survival curves chi square test were performed by GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). In all cases, differences of p < 0.05 are considered to be statistically significant. The Contribution of NF-κB to IL-10 Transcription—We undertook a series of studies to determine whether NF-κB was involved in IL-10 transcription. Initially a murine IL-10 promoter-driven luciferase construct (–1538/+64) was transfected into the macrophage-like cell line, RAW264.7, as previously described (14Brightbill H.D. Plevy S.E. Modlin R.L. Smale S.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1940-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This reporter construct responded to LPS stimulation, resulting in an increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 1A). This reporter construct was also co-transfected along with a p105-based NF-κB super suppressor (p105sr), which contains a deletion in the cleavage domain, preventing signal-induced degradation (34Fu D. Kobayashi M. Lin L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12819-12826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Consequently, p105sr efficiently inhibits all NF-κB activities, including p50 homodimers (34Fu D. Kobayashi M. Lin L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12819-12826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The p105sr effectively inhibited LPS-induced IL-10 promoter activities, reducing luciferase activity to levels that were not different from unstimulated (medium) cells (Fig. 1A). We then truncated the IL-10 promoter to –158/+64 and performed similar studies. Again this reporter responded to LPS stimulation, and this response was completely blocked by p105sr (Fig. 1A). Similar studies were also performed with a dominant positive IκB-α mutant plasmid (IκB-α mut), which encodes a protein with a deletion of N-terminal amino acids 1–36, lacking the phosphorylation sites necessary for ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, it is a pan-NF-κB signaling blocker (45Feng B. Cheng S. Pear W.S. Liou H.C. Med. Immunol. 2004; 3: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The IκB-α mut had similar inhibitory activity to p105sr, reducing luciferase levels to that observed in unstimulated cells (data not shown). Because the proximal reporter preserved most of the LPS-induced luciferase activity, we focused on the proximal region of the IL-10 promoter to address NF-κB responsiveness. To determine which of the NF-κB/Rel family members were involved in IL-10 induction, expression plasmids encoding the five NF-κB/Rel family members, including RelA (p65), NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52), c-Rel, and RelB (19Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar) were co-transfected into cells with pIL-10(–158/+64)-luc. Only the overexpression of p50 induced substantial levels of IL-10-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 1B). None of the other Rel family members resulted in increased luciferase activity. The p50 homodimer-induced IL-10 promoter activity responded not only to LPS stimulation (Fig. 1B), but also to several other TLR agonists, including Pam (2Fujiwara N. Kobayashi K. Curr. Drug Targets. Inflamm. Allergy. 2005; 4: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) and Pam(3)CSK4 (supplemental Fig. S1). To determine whether p50 worked alone or paired with one of the other NF-κB/Rel family members, a co-transfection approach was taken, using a combination of Rel family members. Similar to Fig. 1B, the expression of p50 alone resulted in a significant induction luciferase activity in response to LPS (Fig. 1C). Co-transfecting either p65 or c-Rel together with p50, however, resulted in a substantial decrease in luciferase activity relative to that of p50 alone (Fig. 1C). These studies suggest that NF-κB participates in the IL-10 transcriptional regulation and that p50 is the only Rel family member to drive IL-10 transcription. The other NF-κB/Rel family members not only fail to contribute to IL-10 transcription, they can actually inhibit it. The Binding of p50 to the IL-10 Promoter—To dissect the NF-κB binding site(s) in the murine IL-10 promoter, the MatInspector program (46Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar) was used to analyze a portion of the proximal IL-10 promoter. We combined this with an EMSA approach using recombinant p50. The –59/–39 site of the IL-10 promoter bound recombinant p50, and this binding was competed for by increasing molar ratios of a cold oligomer corresponding to this site (Fig. 2A). The binding of p50 to this site was also competed for by a cold consensus NF-κB element (Fig. 2A). However, a mutant form of the consensus oligomer, containing a single base mutation (G → C) in the NF-κB binding site failed to compete for binding (Fig. 2A). A similar competitive EMSA was done with another single base substitution (–48C → G). This mutant also failed to compete for binding (supplemental Fig. S2A). EMSA and supershift analysis were also performed using nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated primary murine macrophages (Fig. 2B). Nuclear extracts from stimulated cells bound to the –59/–39 element (Fig. 2B). The addition of antibody to p50 resulted in a supershift (Fig. 2B), however antibodies to p65 and c-Rel failed to supershift (Fig. 2B). In contrast to IL-10, these same antibodies to p65 and c-Rel supershifted NF-κB from the IL-12 promoter (supplemental Fig. S2B). The binding of nuclear extracts to the IL-10 promoter was competed for by a cold oligomer corresponding to the –59/–39 site and by a consensus NF-κB oligomer (supplemental Fig. S2C). However, binding was not competed for by an NF-κB oligomer containing a single base substitution (supplemental Fig. S2C), indicating that the binding was specific to this sequence. Similar EMSA and supershift results were observed with nuclear extracts from stimulated RAW264.7 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that p50 binds to the –59/–39 site of the IL-10 promoter. To demonstrate that the p50-binding site was biologically relevant, a plasmid containing a minimal IL-10 promoter (–82/+64) upstream of luciferase was constructed. This minimal promoter efficiently drove p50-induced luciferase production (Fig. 3). On this backbone, a single base mutation (–48) in the –59/–39 site (bold) significantly reduced luciferase activity. A mutation (–22) at another potential NF-κB binding site identified by the MatInspector program (located –22/+1) did not decrease luciferase activity. Furthermore, mutations in both sites behaved similarly to the single –48 mutation (Fig. 3). Thus, p50 not only binds to the –59/–39 site in the IL-10 promoter, but also activates IL-10 promoter activity. To verify the binding of p50 to the IL-10 promoter in situ in live cells, a ChIP assay was performed. BMMϕ were stimulated with LPS for various times, and then processed for ChIP analysis using anti-p50, -p65, and -c-Rel antibodies, or normal rabbit IgG as a control. By ChIP assay, p50 preferentially bound to this segment of the IL-10 promoter, whereas p65 and c-Rel did not (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the IL-10 promoter, the IL-12(p35) promoter preferentially bound to c-Rel and to a lesser extent, p50 and p65 (Fig. 4B). As an additional control, an upstream region (–1563/–1427) of th"

Although ligation of CD36 by antibodies, recombinant type 1 repeats of thrombospondin-1, or CD36-binding peptides was sufficient to inhibit nitric oxide (NO)-stimulated responses in both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, picomolar concentrations of native thrombospondin-1 similarly inhibited NO signaling in vascular cells from wild-type and CD36-null mice. Ligation of the thrombospondin-1 receptor CD47 by recombinant C-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1, thrombospondin-1 peptides, or CD47 antibodies was also sufficient to inhibit NO-stimulated phenotypic responses and cGMP signaling in vascular cells. Thrombospondin-1 did not inhibit NO signaling in CD47-null vascular cells or NO-stimulated vascular outgrowth from CD47-null muscle explants in three-dimensional cultures. Furthermore, the CD36-binding domain of thrombospondin-1 and anti-angiogenic peptides derived from this domain failed to inhibit NO signaling in CD47-null cells. Therefore, ligation of either CD36 or CD47 is sufficient to inhibit NO-stimulated vascular cell responses and cGMP signaling, but only CD47 is necessary for this activity of thrombospondin-1 at physiological concentrations.

Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 630-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but its regulated appearance in the extracellular matrix plays important roles in responses to acute injury and in several chronic disease states in the adult. TSP1 is a major component of platelet α-granules and is released from platelets upon activation, where it modulates platelet adhesion and the properties of fibrin clots formed following acute vascular injury (3Mosher D.F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5605-5612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). TSP1 released from platelets or produced locally in response to cytokines and growth factors also plays an important role in recruitment of mononuclear cells during the early phases of wound repair, and the absence of TSP1 delays excisional wound repair in mice (5Agah A. Kyriakides T.R. Lawler J. Bornstein P. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 831-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). TSP1 also accumulates in the neointima of atherosclerotic lesions (6Riessen R. Kearney M. Lawler J. Isner J.M. Am. Heart. J. 1998; 135: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), where it may stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration by enhancing responsiveness to platelet-derived growth factor (7Isenberg J.S. Calzada M.J. Zhou L. Guo N. Lawler J. Wang X.Q. Frazier W.A. Roberts D.D. Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 110-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Antibody blocking of TSP1 can reverse this response and enhance the re-endothelialization of an injured artery (8Chen D. Asahara T. Krasinski K. Witzenbichler B. Yang J. Magner M. Kearney M.

An N700S coding sequence polymorphism in TSP1 that alters its conformation is associated with increased risk of premature familial myocardial infarction (reviewed in Ref. 9Stenina O.I. Byzova T.V. Adams J.C. McCarthy J.J. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1013-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TSP1 is also a potent modulator of angiogenesis (10Lawler J. Detmar M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1038-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of TSP1 stimulates angiogenesis through its interactions with α3β1 and α4β1 integrins (11Calzada M.J. Zhou L. Sipes J.M. Zhang J. Krutzsch H.C. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Annis D.S.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2885-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), but the central type 1 repeats contain sequences that potently inhibit angiogenesis via CD36 and/or heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors (13Dawson D.W.

Roberts D.D. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Under most circumstances, the net activity of intact TSP1 is anti-angiogenic. Thus, the absence of TSP1 enhances experimental and tumor-induced angiogenic responses (15Lawler J. Miao W.M. Duquette M. Bouck N. Bronson R.T. Hynes R.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Bocci G. Francia G. Man S. Lawler J. Kerbel R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dermatol. 2004; 122: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Vascular effects of TSP1 are mediated by its binding to receptors on both endothelial and VSMCs. Endothelial cells express at least eight TSP1 receptors, and several of these are shared on VSMCs. Based on the activity of CD36 antibody FA6-152 to block the inhibitory effect of TSP1 on FGF2-induced microvascular endothelial cell motility and the failure of TSP1 to inhibit corneal angiogenesis induced by FGF2 in CD36–/– mice, CD36 is considered to be the primary TSP1 receptor that mediates this anti-angiogenic activity (13Dawson D.W.

Silverstein R.L. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Some evidence indicates that TSP1 also inhibits angiogenesis through β1 integrins, CD47, LRP/calreticulin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (14Iruela-Arispe M.L. Lombardo M. Krutzsch H.C. Lawler J. Roberts D.D. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 19Short S.M. Derrien A. Narsimhan R.P. Lawler J. Ingber D.E. Zetter B.R. J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1090-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but the necessity of these receptors for TSP1 to inhibit angiogenesis has not been confirmed in the respective receptor-null mice. To develop effective angiogenesis inhibitors based on TSP1, it is important to establish whether additional signaling pathways may allow TSP1 to inhibit angiogenesis in a CD36-independent manner. We recently found that the anti-angiogenic activity of TSP1 is dramatically potentiated in the presence of low concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) donors (22Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This activity is mediated at least in part through inhibition by TSP1 of cGMP signaling via NO-mediated activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase in both endothelial cells (22Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and VSMCs (23Isenberg J.S. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Moreover, TSP1-null vascular cells exhibit elevated basal cGMP levels and enhanced cGMP and phenotypic responses to exogenous NO. The inhibitory activity of TSP1 on NO signaling was replicated by an agonist CD36 antibody and by a recombinant CD36-binding region of TSP1, suggesting that this activity is also mediated by CD36. However, our attempts to confirm this hypothesis led us to revise this model. We present here evidence that a second TSP1 receptor, CD47, plays the primary role in mediating the inhibitory activities of TSP1 for vascular cells. Remarkably, CD47 is also necessary for inhibition of NO signaling by CD36 ligands.

Handling and care of animals was in compliance with the guidelines established by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the National Cancer Institute and of Washington University School of Medicine. Explant Invasion Assay—Muscle biopsies from the pectoralis major muscle of 8- to 12-week-old wild-type or transgenic mice were harvested and explanted into 100 μlof type I collagen gel in 96-well tissue culture plates as described (7Isenberg J.S. Calzada M.J. Zhou L. Guo N. Lawler J. Wang X.Q. Frazier W.A. Roberts D.D. Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 110-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Following gelation, the embedded explants were overlaid with 75 μlof EGM plus 2% FCS in the presence or absence of a dose range of DETA/NO (0.01–1000 μm) and other indicated treatments and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 7 days, at which time maximum vascular cell migration through the matrix was measured. Cell Proliferation—Proliferation of vascular cells was measured with a non-radioactive colorimetric assay (CellTiter 96, Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, to each well of a 96-well culture plate (Nunc, Denmark) 5 × 103 cells were suspended in 100 μl of culture medium with indicated treatments and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Following incubation 20 μl of tetrazolium compound/solubilization agent was added, and incubation continued for 4 h under the same conditions. The plate was then read on a MR580 Microelisa Auto Reader (Dynatech) at a wavelength of 490 nm. Appropriate zero time controls were run for all assays, and the optical density readings obtained were then subtracted from those obtained at 72 h. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion was carried out in 96-well culture plates. After pre-coating wells with type I collagen (3 μg/ml in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline) harvested cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in medium plus 0.1% BSA and treatment agents and incubated in 5% CO2 for 1 h. Wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, washed, and stained with 1% crystal violet for 20 min. Excess stain was rinsed away, adherent cells were treated with 10% acetic acid, and plates were read at 570 nm. Intracellular cGMP Measurement—HUVECs (104 cells/well) were grown overnight in 96-well culture plates containing full growth medium with 2% FCS and weaned in growth medium without additives and 1% FCS over 24 h before treatment with NO donors and other agents in SM-GM without additives plus 0.1% BSA. Intracellular cGMP levels were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences). In other experiments ASMCs from wild-type and CD36 or CD47-null mice were plated onto 96-well culture plates and incubated overnight in full growth medium. They were then weaned off serum as described to SM-GM plus 0.1% BSA and treated with NO donor and other agents as indicated. Intracellular cyclic nucleotides were determined via immunoassay. Statistics—All studies were repeated in triplicate, and results are presented as the mean ± S.D., with analysis of significance done using the Student's t test and a p < 0.05 taken as significant. Peptide Ligands of Three TSP1 Receptors Inhibit Explant Angiogenic Responses—As previously reported (22Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), sustained exposure to exogenous NO released by the donor DETA/NO stimulated vascular outgrowth from muscle explants in three-dimensional collagen cultures to a greater extent in those from TSP1-null when compared with WT mice (Fig. 1A, controls). Consistent with their reported affects on endothelial cells in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo (14Iruela-Arispe M.L. Lombardo M. Krutzsch H.C. Lawler J. Roberts D.D. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Kanda S. Shono T. Tomasini-Johansson B. Klint P. Saito Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), a CD36-binding peptide from the third type 1 repeat of TSP1 (p245, VTCGGGVQKRSRL), a CD47-binding peptide from the C-terminal module of TSP1 (p7N3, FIRVVMYEGKK), and to a lesser extent a heparin- and transforming growth factor-β-binding peptide from the second type 1 repeat (p246, KRFKQDGGWSHWSPWSS) inhibited vascular cell outgrowth from both wild-type and TSP1-null explants stimulated by NO (Fig. 1). Conversely, the described pro-angiogenic activities of the N-terminal region of TSP1 (11Calzada M.J. Zhou L. Sipes J.M. Zhang J. Krutzsch H.C. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2885-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) were reflected by enhanced vascular outgrowth from explants in the presence of recombinant NoC1. Assuming that these peptides act as agonists of their respective receptors, this indicates that ligating CD36, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, or CD47 is sufficient to inhibit NO-stimulated vascular outgrowth, whereas ligating β1 integrins or other TSP1 N-module receptors enhances vascular outgrowth under the same conditions. CD47 but Not CD36 Is Necessary for Inhibition by TSP1 of Explant Angiogenic Responses—Although the former data show that ligating CD36 or CD47 is sufficient to inhibit explant angiogenesis stimulated by NO, they do not prove that the respective receptors are necessary for activities of the peptide ligands or of intact TSP1. Furthermore, although these peptides clearly bind to the indicated receptors, structural studies have raised concerns that VVM peptides may not represent the true CD47 binding site in the C-terminal domain of TSP1 (32Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To directly address the roles of CD36 and CD47 in the inhibitory activity of TSP1, muscle explants from mice lacking the respective receptors were placed into three-dimensional collagen cultures (Fig. 2). Similar to wild-type explants, NO dose-dependently stimulated vascular outgrowth in CD36- or CD47-null explants. Remarkably, the ability of exogenous TSP1 to antagonize this response was preserved in CD36-null explants (Fig. 2B) but lost in CD47-null explants (Fig. 2A). Thus, CD47 is necessary for the anti-angiogenic activity of TSP1 in this assay, but CD36 is not. This result was unexpected given that a recombinant CD36-binding domain of TSP1 (3TSR) and a CD36 antibody (SMΦ) described to be an agonist based on its ability to mimic TSP1 (13Dawson D.W. Pearce S.F. Zhong R. Silverstein R.L. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) were shown previously to inhibit endothelial cell adhesion on type I collagen stimulated by acute NO exposure (22Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This prompted us to re-examine the role of CD36 in this activity of TSP1. CD36 Ligation Is Sufficient but Not Necessary for Inhibition of NO Responses by TSP1—A CD36-binding peptide derived from the third type 1 repeat (p906, VTAGGGVQKRSRL) and a derivative of the second type 1 repeat with enhanced CD36-binding and anti-angiogenic activity (p907, GDGV(D/I)TRIR (33Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Pearce S.F. Schneider A.J. Silverstein R.L. Henkin J. Bouck N.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)) similarly inhibited NO-stimulated endothelial cell adhesion (Fig. 3A). As previously reported, the CD36 agonist antibody SMΦ inhibited NO-stimulated cell adhesion, whereas a control IgM was inactive (Fig. 3C). However, two CD36 antibodies that were reported to antagonize inhibition by TSP1, FA6-152 (13Dawson D.W. Pearce S.F. Zhong R. Silverstein R.L. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and 185-1G2 (19Short S.M. Derrien A. Narsimhan R.P. Lawler J. Ingber D.E. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), also inhibited NO-stimulated adhesion (Fig. 3, B and D). Isotype-matched control antibodies did not inhibit NO-stimulated cell adhesion, demonstrating the specificity of these CD36 antibodies for blocking an NO response. Thus, various CD36 ligands are sufficient to inhibit NO-stimulated endothelial cell responses, but their mechanism of action may differ from the previously described TSP1 responses that were antagonized by the CD36 antibody FA6-152 (13Dawson D.W. Pearce S.F. Zhong R. Silverstein R.L. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Antagonism of NO signaling by TSP1 is conserved in VSMCs (23Isenberg J.S. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Consistent with the data for endothelial cells in Fig. 3, the CD36 antagonist antibodies FA6-152 and 185-1G2 but not isotype-matched control antibodies were dose-dependent inhibitors of NO-stimulated HASMC adhesion (Fig. 4A and results not shown). The FA6-152 antibody also prevented NO-induced accumulation of cGMP in HASMCs (Fig. 4B), consistent with its effects on NO-stimulated adhesion but not with its reported activity as a TSP1 antagonist (13Dawson D.W. Pearce S.F. Zhong R. Silverstein R.L. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 18Jimenez B. Volpert O.V. Crawford S.E. Febbraio M. Silverstein R.L. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of NO signaling by CD36 ligation is conserved in both types of vascular cells but is independent of the ability of CD36 ligands to mimic or inhibit TSP1 activity in other angiogenesis assays. To clarify the role of CD36 in inhibition by TSP1 of NO-stimulated responses, we used MASMCs derived from WT and CD36-null mice (Fig. 5). Low dose NO significantly stimulated adhesion of WT MASMCs on type I collagen, and TSP1 at 22 pm inhibited this response to control levels (Fig. 5A). Higher doses of TSP1 further inhibited adhesion below baseline. Remarkably, 22 pm TSP1 inhibited NO-stimulated adhesion of CD36-null MASMC to the same extent as in WT cells. Although higher concentrations of TSP1 further suppressed NO-induced adhesion of WT cells to levels below the basal level of the untreated controls, in the CD36-null cells further inhibition by TSP1 was only seen at 22 nm. These data established that CD36 is not necessary for picomolar concentrations of TSP1 to inhibit an NO-stimulated response, although a secondary inhibitory response at nanomolar concentrations of TSP1 does require CD36. We have shown that picomolar concentrations of TSP1 inhibit NO signaling at the level of cGMP (22Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23Isenberg J.S. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). To establish whether inhibition by TSP1 of NO signaling through cGMP requires CD36, cGMP levels were analyzed in the WT and CD36-null MASMCs (Fig. 5B). As shown previously (23Isenberg J.S. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar), NO-stimulated cGMP levels in WT cells were inhibited by exogenous TSP1. This activity of TSP1 does not require CD36, however, because the cGMP response was also completely inhibited by TSP1 in CD36-null MASMC (Fig. 5B). Notably, basal cGMP levels were similar in WT and CD36-null cells, suggesting that the previously reported effects of endogenous TSP1 on basal cGMP levels in vascular cells (22Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23Isenberg J.S. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar) do not require CD36. CD47 Ligation Inhibits NO Responses—The explant data in Fig. 2 suggested that CD47 could mediate the CD36-independent regulation of NO signaling by TSP1. To further examine the role of CD47, we tested two CD47-binding sequences identified in the CBD of TSP1 (34Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Peptides containing the first (4N1-1, Fig. 6A) or second VVM motifs from this domain (7N3, Fig. 6B) inhibited NO-stimulated endothelial cell adhesion on type I collagen. Inhibition by peptide 7N3 was dose-dependent and maximal at 10 μm. Specificity was confirmed using a control peptide in which the first VVM motif was substituted by GGM (p4N1G, RFYGGMWK), which at 10 μm did not significantly inhibit NO-stimulated adhesion (data not shown). Although the VVM peptides clearly bind to CD47 (34Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol.

Decorin evokes protracted internalization of the EGFR via a caveolar-mediated endocytosis, which leads to EGFR degradation and attenuation of its signaling pathway. In this study, we tested if systemic delivery of decorin protein core would affect the biology of an orthotopic squamous carcinoma xenograft. After tumor engraftment, the animals were given intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle or decorin protein core (2.5-10 mg kg-1) every 2 days for 18-38 days. This regimen caused a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of the tumor xenograft growth, with a concurrent decrease in mitotic index and a significant increase in apoptosis. Positron emission tomography showed that the metabolic activity of the tumor xenografts was significantly reduced by decorin treatment. Decorin protein core specifically targeted the tumor cells enriched in EGFR and caused a significant down-regulation of EGFR and attenuation of its activity. In vitro studies showed that the uptake of decorin by the A431 cells was rapid and caused a protracted down-regulation of the EGFR to levels similar to those observed in the tumor xenografts. Furthermore, decorin induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3. This could represent an additional mechanism whereby decorin might influence cell growth and survival.

To prevent the dire consequences of uncontrolled activation of EGFR, a number of negative feedback mechanisms, both extracellular and intracellular, have evolved (2Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr.

Blood. 2001; 98: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A number of observations point toward a key role for decorin in the control of cell proliferation. First, decorin expression is markedly induced in most normal diploid cells at quiescence, whereas its expression is absent in most transformed cells (18Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 19Iozzo R.V. Danielson K.G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Third, transformation induced by the activating transcription factor-3 and the nuclear vSrc and vJun oncoproteins is associated with a marked suppression of decorin gene expression (24Kolettas E.

Owens R.A. McQuillan D.J. Iozzo R.V. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested whether systemic delivery of decorin protein core would affect A431 cells grown as orthotopic skin tumor xenografts. Our results show for the first time that systemic delivery of decorin protein core suppresses in vivo tumorigenicity by specifically targeting EGFR-expressing tumor cells, thereby causing a significant inhibition of tumor metabolism and cell division and concurrent increase in apoptosis. These findings were corroborated by in vitro studies showing that decorin at very low concentrations (∼ 2 nm) caused apoptosis by activating caspase-3. Collectively, these data support a complex mode of action for decorin which culminates in tumor growth suppression and raise the possibility of an efficient protein therapy for cancer. Cell Cultures and Materials—A431 human squamous carcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, 100× antibiotic-antimycotic solutions, and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline were purchased from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). Nitrocellulose membrane was purchased from Bio-Rad. Antibodies include polyclonal rabbit antibodies against active-caspase-3 (Pharmingen), C terminus of perlecan (35Bix G. Fu J. Gonzalez E. Macro L.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the His tag (Calbiochem), β-actin (Sigma), Ki67 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), Tyr(P) (PY20, BD Bioscience), and EGFR (Ab-12; Neomarkers) were also used. Rhodamine- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-goat IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse and rabbit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and goat from Calbiochem. Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate was purchased from Pierce. Animal Experiments and A431 Orthotopic Tumor Xenografts— Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Thomas Jefferson University. Orthotopic tumor xenografts were established as described previously (31Reed C.C. Gauldie J. Iozzo R.V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3688-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Purification and characterization of biologically active decorin protein core was described before (36Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Immunocompromized nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories) were examined every day until 2-3-mm tumors were visible. Tumor xenografts were measured (31Reed C.C. Gauldie J. Iozzo R.V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3688-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and treated every other day by intraperitoneal injections of 60-200 μg of decorin protein core (2.5-10 mg kg-1) per animal for 18-38 days. Animals were sacrificed at the end of the experiment and the tumor, spleen, liver, lungs, kidneys, and heart were dissected. Tumors and organs were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and used for either immunohistochemical or biochemical analysis. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computerized Tomography (CT)—PET studies of control and decorin-treated animals were performed using the MOSAIC PET scanner (Philips Medical Systems). The scanner used 2 × 2 x 10-mm3 gadolinium oxy-orthosilicate crystals coupled to 19-mm diameter photomultiplier tubes via a continuous slotted light guide. The detectors were arranged to produce a transaxial field of view of 128 mm and an axial field of view of 120 mm. The absolute coincidence sensitivity was 1.3% for a point source, and the transverse resolution was 2.2 mm at full-width-half-maximum. Images were reconstructed into 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5-mm3 voxels using a three-dimensional RAMLA algorithm supplied with the camera. CT studies were performed using the MicroCATII CT scanner (Imtek Inc.). A 70 × 100-mm phosphor screen was optically coupled to a 2048 × 3072-pixel CCD camera. The x-ray source and detector were rotated around the subject to produce a transaxial field of view of 51.2 mm and an axial field of view of 76.8 mm. X-rays were generated at 80 kV peak and 500 μA. Images were reconstructed into 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2-mm3 voxels using a Feldkamp cone beam reconstruction algorithm. To perform PET and CT imaging, mice were injected with 0.4-0.5 mCi of [18F]flourodeoxyglucose (18FDG) and allowed 2 h for tracer distribution. Just prior to imaging, mice were anesthetized with an injection of Ketamine, Xylazine, Acetopromazine (200, 10, 2 mg kg-1) via an intraperitoneal injection and placed in a 50-ml tube to facilitate multimodality stereo tactic positioning. PET data were acquired in a single position for 15 min followed by CT data acquisition for 5 min. The images were registered with an internally developed automated mutual information rigid registration algorithm. Volumes of interest were defined by drawing multislice regions of interest on the PET images using 50% of the full-width-half-maximum of the tumor to determine the tumor boundary. PET regions were also defined on contralateral soft tissues and compared with the CT images where necessary. The images were normalized on the average uptake of contralateral abdominal regions. Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Quantification—Frozen sections were dried for 1 h and fixed in ice-cold acetone for 5 min. After washing, the sections were blocked for 18 h with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and subsequently subjected to standard immunofluorescence protocols with various antibodies, co-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and mounted with Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired using an Olympus BX51 microscope driven by SPOT advanced version 4.0.9 imaging software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). To quantify the fluorescence of EGFR in sections of tumor xenografts, control sections were analyzed at different exposure times and gain settings and converted into grayscale (37Zhu J.-X. Goldoni S.

The distribution of the pixel intensity was studied using the histogram function of Adobe Photoshop® 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). The final adjustment was an exposure time of 50 ms, and a camera gain of 8, which records images not saturated in fluorescence intensity. Digital images for control (n = 11) and decorin-treated (n = 8) tumors were acquired. For fluorescence visualization, RGD color images were converted to 8-bit grayscale images, and three-dimensional surface plot analyses were generated with the Surface Plot function of ImageJ 1.34 (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) to show the intensity of the representative fluorescent signals (38Parsons-Wingerter P. Kasman I.M. Norberg S. Magnussen A. Zanivan S. Rissone A. Baluk P. Favre C.J. Jeffry U. Murray R. McDonald D.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 193-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Apoptosis and Mitotic Index in Tumor Xenografts—To analyze apoptosis we used two approaches; the TUNEL assay (BD Bioscience), which labels internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the detection of the protein active caspase-3 on frozen sections. Fluorescence signal of TUNEL staining and active caspase-3 was detected and quantified as described above. To determine the proliferative (mitotic) index, frozen sections of tumor xenografts were stained for the proliferation-associated marker Ki67 and by collecting the total pixel density of 41 individual (200×) fields (20 for control and 21 for decorin-treated tumors) from 8 mice. Pulse-Chase and Dose-Response Experiments—For the pulsechase experiment, confluent A431 cells were serum-starved for 18 h, pulsed with 30 μg ml-1 decorin protein core for 30 min at 37 °C, washed on ice, and then chased with serum-free medium for various time points (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h) at 37 °C. For the dose-response experiment, confluent A431 cells were serumstarved for 18 h and pulsed with various concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, and 30 μg ml-1) of decorin protein core. After 30 min, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and chased for 120 min with serum-free medium. Cells were harvested, and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting using specific antibodies described above. Cells were analyzed for EGFR, β-actin, and PY20-horseradish peroxidase total phosphorylation. Several x-ray films were analyzed to determine the linear range of the chemiluminescence signals and were subsequently quantified with Scion Image alpha 4.0.3.2 and normalized on β-actin. DNA Fragmentation Analysis by FACS and Active Caspase-3—Approximately 0.4 × 106 A431 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes, cultured under standard conditions overnight, and then treated for 24 h with different concentrations of decorin protein core (0.1 ng to 90 μg ml-1) and 200 ng ml-1 EGF in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. As positive controls, cells were treated with etoposide (5 and 10 μm), a topoisomerase-II inhibitor and an established cell cycle-specific DNA-damaging agent (39Hande K.R. Eur. J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 1514-1521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Prior to DNA fragmentation analysis, the cells were trypsinized and fixed with 80% ethanol at 4 °C for 1 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 50 μg ml-1 propidium iodide solution containing 0.5 μg ml-1 RNase A (40Krishan A. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Cells were stained for 3 h at 4°C and DNA fragmentation was analyzed by flow cytometry using an Epics XL-MCL (Beckman Coulter). To evaluate if the kinase activity of EGFR was required for apoptosis, cells were treated with 30 μg ml-1 decorin protein core and 1 μm AG1478 and processed as described above. To corroborate the results obtained for A431 cells, HeLa cells were also used under the same conditions. Active caspase-3 activity was measured with the Caspase-Glo™ 3/7 kit (Promega, Madison, WI), a luminescence assay that measures caspase-3 and -7 activities. It is a mixture of a luminogenic substrate that contains the tetrapeptide sequence DEVD, in a reagent optimized for caspase activity, luciferase activity, and cell lysis. Following caspase cleavage, a substrate for luciferase is released, resulting in the luciferase reaction and the production of light that is proportional to the amount of caspase activity present. Approximately 5 × 103 cells were cultured in 96-well plates for 18 h, following a 24-h dose-dependent treatment with decorin protein core (0.1, 1, 5, 10, 30, and 90 μg ml-1) or 200 ng ml-1 EGF in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Both fragmentation and caspase-3 activation experiments were also performed in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor VAD (Biovison, Mountain View, CA), which preferentially blocks caspases-1-3 (41Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Prior to each analysis, the culture medium was supplemented with 50 μl of substrate solution and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Luminescence measurements were carried out with a microplate reader 1420 Victor3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Results are given as means (n = 3-5) with three independent measurements for each group. Statistical evaluation was done with an unpaired Student's t test using the Sigma Plot 9 statistical package. p < 0.05 was considered as significant. Growth Inhibition of Tumor Xenografts by Systemic Delivery of Human Recombinant Decorin Protein Core—Decorin protein core was purified to homogeneity from the secretions of human embryonic kidney 293 cells and migrated as a monomer of 46-48 kDa on a silver-stained SDS gel (42Goldoni S. Owens R.T. McQuillan D.J. Shriver Z. Sasisekharan R. Birk D.E. Campbell S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Before injecting into the animals, each batch of filtered decorin protein core was tested for biological activity by determining the suppression of basal EGFR phosphorylation in quiescent A431 cells (37Zhu J.-X. Goldoni S. Bix G. Owens R.A. McQuillan D. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32468-32479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We evaluated the effects of systemic delivery of recombinant decorin protein core on the growth kinetics of established orthotopic A431 squamous cell carcinoma xenografts. The results showed that at low dosages of decorin protein core (4.5 mg kg-1), there was a significant (p = 0.025) growth inhibition of the tumor xenografts in two independent experiments (Fig. 1A). We performed a total of four in vivo experiments utilizing 40 animals, of which four were excluded because there was no tumor engraftment. The total amount of decorin protein core injected in each mouse was 540 μg. The basis for the size difference at day 19 was primarily due to a growth rate advantage, since doubling time for the vehicle-treated tumors was significantly shorter than that of the decorin-treated animals (2.5 versus 3.75 days, respectively) (Fig. 1B). Similar growth kinetic was observed with another independent experiment using the same regimen with the exception of lower (2.5 mg kg-1) decorin protein core dosages (data not shown). Interestingly, when the dosage was increased to 10 mg kg-1, there was a greater growth inhibition (p < 0.001) that lasted for up to 38 days (Fig. 1C). In this case, a total amount of 3.8 mg of decorin protein core was injected in each mouse. While in the first 19 days of treatment the tumor doubling times were similar to those obtained with lower decorin dosages, the doubling time of the decorin-treated tumors was much greater (9 days versus 2.5 days) at a later time. Thus, these results indicate that systemic delivery of decorin protein core retards the growth of established orthotopic tumor xenografts in a dose-dependent manner. Next, we determined whether decorin could inhibit in vivo tumor growth by affecting tumor metabolism. To this end, several animals from separate experiments were analyzed by CT and PET scan. This strategy allows for direct visualization and quantification of tissue metabolic activity via the administration of a radioactive sugar, 18FDG, which proportionally distributes to metabolically active tissue. Animals were imaged toward the end of each experimental protocol to allow for maximal tumor visibility in control and treated groups. The results showed a marked inhibition of 18FDG uptake in the decorin-treated tumor xenografts as compared with controls (Fig. 1D). PET scans were carried out using 200-450 μCi of 18FDG at different time points (16, 18, 34, and 36 days) including animals receiving both low and high dosages of decorin protein core, and in all cases there was a significant reduction in metabolic activity. Quantification of a mixture of animals (n = 10) by normalizing the maximal signal in each tumor to that in the abdomen of each animal showed a significantly reduced (p = 0.016) tumor metabolic rate (Fig. 1E). These findings were not due to differences in tumor “size” since we found a significant decrease in tumor metabolism even when comparing similar size tumors. Tumor identification and volumes were verified by concurrent CT scanning, and these values supported the results obtained by manual measurements (data not shown). Therefore, PET scan image analysis indicates that tumor growth inhibition evoked by decorin treatment is at least in part due to reduced tumor metabolic rate. Decorin Targets the Cancer Cells within the Orthotopic Tumor Xenografts—The central hypothesis of our research is that the functional receptor for decorin, i.e. the EGFR, needs to be present within a tumor cell population for decorin binding and suppression of the known oncogenic activity of the receptor. Having established that systemic delivery of decorin retards in vivo tumor growth, we investigated whether decorin would specifically target the EGFR-overproducing tumor cells. Using fluorescence microscopy and an anti-His antibody, which recognizes the N-terminal His tag on decorin, we discovered that decorin protein core specifically targets the tumor cells (Fig. 2). Specifically, decorin epitopes could be detected in the tumor cells proximal to the blood vessels (Fig. 2, B-D), with intervening areas lacking any reactivity. Decorin epitopes were patchy and primarily associated with the cell surface of the A431 squamous carcinoma cells (Fig. 2D), with a distribution similar to the EGFR. The gradient of the fluorescence signal obtained from staining with anti-His suggests that decorin diffuses through the vascular beds and specifically targets the tumor cells. In contrast, very little or no decorin was associated with normal organs, such as spleen and liver (see supplemental Fig. 1). Because decorin has been previously reported to inhibit in vitro angiogenesis by either interacting with thrombospondin-1 (43de Lange Daviesqq C. Melder R.J. Munn L.L. Mouta-Carreira C. Jain R.K. Boucher Y. Microvasc.Res. 2001; 62: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or by reducing the endogenous tumor levels of VEGF (44Grant D.S. Yenisey C. Rose R.W. Tootell M. Santra M.

https://openalex.org/W1988638406,"Two classes of viruses, namely members of the Potyviridae and Caliciviridae, use a novel mechanism for the initiation of protein synthesis that involves the interaction of translation initiation factors with a viral protein covalently linked to the viral RNA, known as VPg. The calicivirus VPg proteins can interact directly with the initiation factors eIF4E and eIF3. Translation initiation on feline calicivirus (FCV) RNA requires eIF4E because it is inhibited by recombinant 4E-BP1. However, to date, there have been no functional studies carried out with respect to norovirus translation initiation, because of a lack of a suitable source of VPg-linked viral RNA. We have now used the recently identified murine norovirus (MNV) as a model system for norovirus translation and have extended our previous studies with FCV RNA to examine the role of the other eIF4F components in translation initiation. We now demonstrate that, as with FCV, MNV VPg interacts directly with eIF4E, although, unlike FCV RNA, translation of MNV RNA is not sensitive to 4E-BP1, eIF4E depletion, or foot-and-mouth disease virus Lb protease-mediated cleavage of eIF4G. We also demonstrate that both FCV and MNV RNA translation require the RNA helicase component of the eIF4F complex, namely eIF4A, because translation was sensitive (albeit to different degrees) to a dominant negative form and to a small molecule inhibitor of eIF4A (hippuristanol). These results suggest that calicivirus RNAs differ with respect to their requirements for the components of the eIF4F translation initiation complex."

Monocyte-macrophages constitute an important cellular component of the mononuclear phagocytic system, playing an essential role in the recognition and activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses against pathogens. The differentiation of monocytes into macrophages in extravascular tissues is an essential event for the normal functioning of the system. Therefore, knowledge of the mechanism and the role of the Neu1 up-regulation during the monocyte differentiation should provide insights into the cellular immune response and may eventually lead to developing approaches for therapeutic intervention. Here we have studied the regulatory mechanisms of the Neu1 expression and presented direct evidence that the NEU1 gene promoter is activated during the monocytic differentiation. We have also shown that the newly synthesized Neu1 is first targeted to the lysosomes and then, as a complex with cathepsin A, relocalizes to the cell surface, where it could participate in antigen presentation or affect intercellular interactions. Isolation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and Purification of Monocytes—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by leukophoresis of blood from human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, and hepatitis B and C seronegative donors followed by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences) gradients using standard procedures. Monocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by an additional centrifugation over Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradients and then by negative selection using a monocyte separation kit (StemSep; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purity of monocytes exceeded 95% as determined by flow cytometry after staining the cells with fluorochrome-labeled antibodies to CD3, CD14, CD19, and CD206 (all from BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA), and viability was greater than 97% as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Culturing of Purified Monocytes—To obtain monocyte-derived macrophages, purified monocytes were suspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA) and were maintained at 4 × 106 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates (Costar; Corning Glass) at 37 °C in a 5% humidified, CO2 incubator. At the indicated times, nonadherent cells were removed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 5The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMA, 12-O-tetra-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; 4MU-NANA, 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid; RT, reverse transcription; AP, activator protein; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; GM3, ganglioside, NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1′Cer. and the adherent, differentiating macrophages (larger and more granular than monocytes as seen by light microscopy) were harvested in PBS, pH 7.4, by gentle scraping with a polyethylene cell scraper (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). The harvested cells were confirmed to have characteristic macrophage cell surface phenotypic markers (CD14+, CD206+) by flow cytometry. Culturing and Differentiation of THP-1 Cells—THP-1 cells, described in greater detail elsewhere (14Tsuchiya S. Yamabe M. Yamaguchi Y. Kobayashi Y. Konno T. Tada K. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 26: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar), were cultured in the RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5000 units of penicillin/streptomycin, and Fungizone (both from Invitrogen). The cells were maintained in suspension at 0.5-1.0 × 106 cells/ml. The differentiation of THP-1 cells into adherent cells with macrophage-like characteristics widely used as a convenient in vitro model for macrophage differentiation (15Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 16Alam J. Cook J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) was induced by the addition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA) (10-20 ng/ml) to the culture medium. After 4 days, the adherent, differentiating macrophages were harvested by scraping as above. Promoter Activity Assay—The fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the NEU1 gene were obtained by the digestion of pBluescript-SP vector with BglII (position -1), BclI (position -176), SacII (position -316), XmaI (position -542), XbaI (position -936), and ApaI (position -1598). The fragments were subcloned into pBLCAT6 vector (15Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), provided by Dr. L. Simard (Montreal University) in front of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, resulting in pBL-NEU1CAT1, pBL-NEU1CAT2, pBL-NEU1CAT3, pBL-NEU1CAT4, and pBL-NEU1CAT5 constructs. pCMV-β-gal vector containing β-galactosidase reporter gene has been provided by Dr. R. Gravel (University of Calgary). Monkey kidney COS-7 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5000 units of penicillin/streptomycin, and Fungizone. Cells seeded in 100-mm tissue culture plates at 70-80% confluence were cotransfected with the reporter constructs and pCMV-β-gal expression vector using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. THP-1 cells suspended in RPMI 1640 medium at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml medium were cotransfected with the reporter constructs and pCMV-β-gal expression vector using Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after the transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and stimulated for 2-24 h with PMA (20 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (40 ng per ml), or platelet-derived growth factor-AB (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of 20 mm N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or 0.5 μm curcumin (all from Sigma). In a separate experiment, curcumin and NAC were added in the same final concentration 1 h before the addition of PMA or TNF-α. After 24-h incubation, the cells were rinsed with PBS, harvested by scraping, and resuspended in 350 μl of TEN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl). Cells were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min and lysed by three freezing-thawing cycles in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. CAT and β-galactosidase activities were measured using [14C]choramphenicol and 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-β-d-galactopyranoside substrates as described (16Alam J. Cook J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate/min. Proteins were assayed according to Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Enzyme Assays—Sialidase, β-galactosidase, and β-hexosaminidase activities in cellular homogenates and in culture medium were assayed using the corresponding fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferyl-glycoside substrates (18Potier M. Mameli L. Belisle M. Dallaire L. Melancon S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 19Rome L.H. Garvin A.J. Allietta M.M. Neufeld E.F. Cell. 1979; 17: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Cathepsin A activity was determined with benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu (20Tranchemontagne J. Michaud L. Potier M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and GAPDH were measured as described elsewhere (21Bergmeyer H. Gawhen K. Grassl M. Bergmeyer H.V. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag-Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1974: 495-496Google Scholar, 22Schmidt E. Bergmeyer H.V. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis.

Sialidase activity toward mixed bovine gangliosides was measured as described (24Miyagi T. Hata K. Hasegawa A. Aoyagi T. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Schneider-Jakob H.R. Cantz M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1991; 372: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100. The concentration of released sialic acid was measured by the thio-barbituric method (26Manzi A.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003: 17.18.8-17.18.10Google Scholar). Enzyme activity is expressed as the conversion of 1 nmol of substrate/h. To measure the enzyme activities on the outer cell surface, the cultured live cells (∼106 cells) were washed several times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and overlaid with 500 μl of 20 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.2, 0.25 m sucrose, and either 0.4 mm sialidase substrate, cathepsin A substrate, β-galactosidase substrate, or N-acetyl β-hexosaminidase substrate. After 30 min of incubation, 200-μl aliquots of medium were collected, and the concentrations of the products were measured as described above. The integrity of plasma membrane was verified by Western blot by measuring the amount of the cytosolic enzyme GAPDH released into the cell medium during the incubation. We found that the same amount of GAPDH was released from the cells incubated in 20 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.2, 0.25 m sucrose, and PBS. To measure the total amount of enzyme, the assay was performed in the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100. Detection of CathA and Neu1 on the Macrophage Surface by Western Blot—Proliferating THP-1 cells and THP-1-derived macrophages (∼5 × 106 cells) were washed three times by ice-cold PBS and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in 5 ml of PBS containing a biotinamido hexanoic acid biotinylation reagent (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml with a gentle rotation. The cells were washed three times with TBS and homogenized in 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer. The cell lysate cleared by a 10-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g was loaded on a 0.2-ml Streptavidin-agarose column (Sigma), and the column was washed by PBS until the absorbance at 280 nm reached the base line. Biotinylated proteins were eluted with 0.2 ml of 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). The pH of the eluate was immediately adjusted to neutral with 1.5 m Tris buffer (pH 7.5). 20 μg of protein from the original cell lysate and the Streptavidin-agarose column flow-through fraction and 5 μg of protein from the eluate were separated on a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was hybridized with the polyclonal anti-Neu1 antibodies (dilution 1:5000) and anti-cathepsin A antibodies (dilution 1:2000). Detection was performed using a Roche Applied Science Western kit. Internalization of Texas Red-labeled Dextran and Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)—THP-1 cells suspended at 1.0 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum in a 6-well tissue culture plate were loaded with Texas Red-labeled fluorescent dextran 40,000 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in a concentration of 50 μg/ml medium or the horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) in a concentration of 2 mg/ml medium. Treated THP-1 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 2 h. Then the cells were harvested by a low speed centrifugation and washed with RPMI 1640 medium two times at room temperature and resuspended in the fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were treated with PMA (20 ng/ml of culture medium) as described above. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and if necessary were permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-Neu1 or anti-cathepsin A antibodies and counterstained with Texas Red-labeled antibodies against rabbit IgG. Cells were also double-stained with rabbit antibodies against Neu1 or cathepsin A antibodies and monoclonal antibodies against LAMP-2 (Washington Biotechnology Inc., Baltimore, MD) or against MHC II (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON). The primary monoclonal antibodies were counterstained with Oregon Green 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes). The cells loaded with the HRP were stained with the Texas Red-conjugated antibodies against HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Cells were also stained with the rabbit anti-Neu1 or anti-cathepsin A antibodies counterstained with Oregon Green 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies and PE-conjugated monoclonal anti-mannose receptor antibodies or anti-CD14 antibodies (BD Pharmingen). Slides were examined on a Zeiss LSM510 inverted confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Neu1 and Neu3 detection was performed with rabbit antibodies as described (13Stamatos N.M. Liang F. Nan X. Landry K. Cross A.S. Wang L.-X. Pshezhetsky A.V. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2545-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Vinogradova M.V. Michaud L. Mezentsev A.V. Lukong K.E. El Alfy M. Morales C.R. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V. Biochem.

RNA Isolation and Real-time RT-PCR—THP-1 cells and THP-1-derived macrophages were harvested as previously described, and total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. The RNA preparation was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature to remove the DNA contamination and then inactivated by adding 25 mm EDTA solution to the reaction mixture. 1 μg of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA in the presence of 0.5 mm dNTPs, 50 ng of random hexamers (Invitrogen), and 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was allowed to proceed for 50 min at 42 °C. PCR amplification was performed on a SmartCycler (Cepheid) using the SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). The primer pairs, annealing temperatures, number of PCR cycles, and RNA amounts are shown in supplemental Table 1, which also shows the predicted sizes of the resulting PCR products. As positive controls for real-time PCR detection, we used mRNA coding for the ribosomal subunit 18 S (Ambion). All reactions were performed in triplicate. The accuracy of the reaction was monitored by the analysis of melting curves and product size on gel electrophoresis. Northern Blot Analysis—Purified total RNA from THP-1 cells and THP-1-derived macrophages was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with the following probes: a 500-bp Neu4 cDNA fragment obtained from clone 4156395 by PvuII digestion, an entire Neu1 cDNA, a 700-bp Neu3 fragment obtained from a cDNA clone by PstI digestion, and an entire cDNA of human β-actin. All probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming using Mega-Prime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Prehybridization of the blots was performed at 68 °C for 30 min in ExpressHy-bTM (Clontech). The denatured probes were added directly to the prehybridization solution and incubated at 68 °C for 1 h. The blots were washed twice for 30 min with 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature and once for 40 min with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and exposed to a BioMax film overnight at -80 °C. Neu1 Small Interfering RNA Gene Silencing in Human Skin Fibroblasts—Silencer™ predesigned siRNA ID:8386, ID:8481 and ID:8573 (CAT:16704) targeting exons 1, 2, and 3 of the human NEU1 gene, respectively, were obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). THP-1 cells were transfected with siRNA using the Nucleo-fector™ Solution V reagent (Amaxa) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. GAPDH siRNA (Ambion) was used as a positive control for the optimization of transfection conditions. The siRNA efficacy was verified in preliminary experiments where THP-1 cells were harvested 24 and 48 h after transfection with three Neu1 siRNAs, and the sialidase activity was measured with 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4MU-NANA), as described above. The most effective Neu1 siRNA (ID:8481) was selected to perform the suppression experiments. The expression of the Neu1 in the transfected cells was measured on the RNA and protein level by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and enzyme activity assay as described. On average, sialidase activity in the differentiated Neu1 siRNA-transfected THP-1 cells was reduced more then 4-fold as compared with mock-transfected cells (not shown). Phagocytosis Assay—Differentiation of THP-1 cells was induced by PMA in the presence of either anti-Neu1 rabbit antiserum or control preimmune serum (20 and 100 μg/ml of medium). THP-1 cells transfected with Neu1 siRNA were differentiated in the presence of PMA only. After 4 days, cells seeded on coverslips were incubated within 3 h with fluorescein-labeled Escherichia coli (K-12 strain), bioparticles (Molecular Probes) in a ratio of 30 particles/cell, washed three times with cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and washed twice with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. Cells were counterstained with 3 μm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and washed again with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. Slides were studied on the Nikon Eclipse E6000 direct epifluorescence microscope. Measurement of IL and TNF-α Production in Culture Supernatants by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—In order to determine the potential effect of anti-Neu1 serum on the secretion of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IL-1b, and TNFα, THP-1 cells cultured in a 6-well plate (3 × 106 cells/well) were stimulated with PMA (20 ng/ml) in the absence and in the presence of rabbit preimmune serum (100 μg/ml) or rabbit antiserum raised against the human Neu1 (20 and 100 μg/ml of medium). After a 96-h incubation, the differentiated cells were further stimulated for 12 h by ionomycin (1 μg/ml; Sigma) and PMA (20 ng/ml) also in the absence and in the presence of rabbit preimmune serum or rabbit anti-Neu1 antiserum. The concentration of IL and TNF-α in the culture medium was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Neu1 Expression Is Increased during PMA-induced Differentiation of Monocytic Cell Line THP-1—Previous studies defined a monocytic cell line THP-1 from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute monocytic leukemia (14Tsuchiya S. Yamabe M. Yamaguchi Y. Kobayashi Y. Konno T. Tada K. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 26: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). Being induced by PMA, these cells differentiate into adherent cells having morphological, biochemical, and physiological characteristics of macrophages and expressing the characteristic macrophage cell surface phenotypic markers, such as CD14+ and CD206+ (28Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okumura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar, 29Auwerx J. Experientia. 1991; 47: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). THP-1 cells have several advantages over primary human monocytes (higher transfection efficiency, homogeneity, accessibility) that make them a reliable model to study the mechanism of monocytic differentiation. We found that during the PMA-induced differentiation, the sialidase activity measured at acidic pH 4.5 with the synthetic fluorescent substrate 4MU-NANA was increased at least 4-fold, whereas the levels of other lysosomal enzymes and proteins (cathepsin A, β-galactosidase, β-hexosaminidase, and LAMP-2) or of cytosolic enzyme GAPDH were not changed (Fig. 1A). The observed increase of the endogeneous sialidase activity could be caused by up-regulation of any of four previously described human sialidases: lysosomal (Neu1 (gene NEU1) and Neu4 (gene NEU4)), cytoplasmic (Neu2, gene NEU2), and plasma membrane (Neu3, gene NEU3). Since the cytosolic sialidase Neu2 is mostly active at neutral pH (30Monti E. Preti A. Nesti C. Ballabio A. Borsani G. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1313-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the sialidase activity measured with 4MU-NANA at pH 7.5 was not increased during the differentiation of THP-1 cells (Fig. 1A), we could exclude this enzyme. Three remaining enzymes, Neu1, Neu3, and Neu4, all have an acidic pH optimum, but they differ from each other in substrate specificity; Neu1 shows the highest activity against oligosacharides and short glycopeptides (24Miyagi T. Hata K. Hasegawa A. Aoyagi T. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas Neu3 and Neu4 are equally active against α2-3-sialylated oligosaccharides, glycopeptides, and gangliosides (25Schneider-Jakob H.R. Cantz M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1991; 372: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Li S.C. Li Y.T. Moriya S. Miyagi T. Biochem.

Chem. 2004; 279: 37021-37029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Sialidase activity of THP-1 cells measured against sialylated glycolipids (mixed bovine gangliosides) was slightly reduced during differentiation (1.1 ± 0.2 versus 1.7 ± 0.3 nmol/h/mg of total protein) (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the increase of sialidase activity is caused by the up-regulation of the lysosomal sialidase Neu1. In addition, both quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blots showed that during the differentiation, the Neu1 mRNA was increased at least 5-fold (Fig. 1, B and C), whereas Neu3 mRNA was decreased 3-4-fold according to the RT-PCR data (Fig. 1B). Neu2 and Neu4 expression could not be detected in the THP-1 monocytes as well as in the THP-1-derived macrophages, neither by RT-PCR nor by Northern blots. Western blots using the polyclonal anti-Neu1 and anti-Neu3 antibodies confirmed up-regulation of Neu1 and down-regulation of Neu3 at the protein level (Fig. 1D). Altogether, our data showed that the differentiation of THP-1 cells into macrophages results in significant and specific induction of Neu1.

https://openalex.org/W2160401081,"Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is expressed as long and short isoforms from unique transcriptional start sites within a single gene. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) augments intestinal epithelial long MLCK expression, which is critical to cytoskeletal regulation. We found that TNF increases long MLCK mRNA transcription, both in human enterocytes in vitro and murine enterocytes in vivo.5′-RACE identified two novel exons, 1A and 1B, which encode alternative long MLCK transcriptional start sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and site-directed mutagenesis identified two essential Sp1 sites upstream of the exon 1A long MLCK transcriptional start site. Analysis of deletion and truncation mutants showed that a 102-bp region including these Sp1 sites was necessary for basal transcription. A promoter construct including 4-kb upstream of exon 1A was responsive to TNF, AP-1, or NFκB, but all except NFκB responses were absent in a shorter 2-kb construct, and all responses were absent in a 1-kb construct. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, ChIP, and site-directed mutagenesis explained these data by identifying three functional AP-1 sites between 2- and 4-kb upstream of exon 1A and two NFκB sites between 1- and 2-kb upstream of exon 1A. Analysis of differentiating epithelia showed that only well differentiated enterocytes activated the 4-kb long MLCK promoter in response to TNF, and consensus promoter reporters demonstrated that TNF-induced NFκB activation decreased during differentiation while TNF-induced AP-1 activation increased. Thus either AP-1 or NFκB can up-regulate long MLCK transcription, but the mechanisms by which TNF up-regulates intestinal epithelial long MLCK transcription from exon 1A are differentiation-dependent.

It contains the same catalytic and regulatory domains as short MLCK but also includes an N-terminal extension that contains six immunoglobulin-like modules and two tandem actin binding domains (9Kudryashov D.S.

Long MLCK must therefore be transcribed from an upstream promoter, although this promoter has not been identified. Long MLCK is the principal form expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (8Clayburgh D.R. Rosen S. Witkowski E.D. Wang F. Blair S. Dudek S. Garcia J.G. Alverdy J.C. Turner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55506-55513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and expression of long MLCK is increased by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment of cultured intestinal epithelial monolayers (10Wang F.

Said H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: G422-G430Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These increases in MLCK protein expression are accompanied by increased myosin light chain phosphorylation which, in turn, leads to disruption of the epithelial barrier (12Zolotarevsky Y. Hecht G.

This long MLCK-dependent disruption of epithelial barrier function is an important component of intestinal disease (15Clayburgh D.R. Shen L. Turner J.R. Lab. Investig. 2004; 84: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). For example, long MLCK knock-out mice are protected from TNF-dependent intestinal epithelial MLC phosphorylation, barrier loss, and diarrhea (16Clayburgh D.R. Barrett T.A. Tang Y. Meddings J.B. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Clarke L.L. Mrsny R.J. Turner J.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2702-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Similar protection is conferred by pharmacological intestinal epithelial MLCK inhibition (16Clayburgh D.R. Barrett T.A. Tang Y. Meddings J.B. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Clarke L.L. Mrsny R.J. Turner J.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2702-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). While the functional significance of increased intestinal epithelial long MLCK expression has not been defined in humans, it is notable that intestinal epithelial cells of patients with inflammatory bowel disease also display increased long MLCK expression (17Blair S.A. Kane S.V. Clayburgh D.R. Turner J.R. Lab. Investig. 2006; 86: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This is remarkable, as inflammatory bowel disease patients are known to have epithelial barrier defects that can be corrected by anti-TNF therapy (18Suenaert P. Bulteel V. Lemmens L. Noman M. Geypens B. Van Assche G. Geboes K. Ceuppens J.L. Rutgeerts P. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2002; 97: 2000-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, inducible long MLCK expression may be a critical regulator of intestinal epithelial barrier function and disease pathogenesis. Despite data indicating the potential biological and therapeutic potential of harnessing inducible long MLCK expression, the factors that regulate this process are unknown. Using the model of TNF-induced long MLCK expression in intestinal epithelia, we now show this process to be caused by transcriptional activation. TNF increased long MLCK mRNA transcripts in cultured human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and in mouse intestinal epithelial cells in vivo. Two novel human long MLCK transcriptional start sites, corresponding to novel exons, were identified and the promoter corresponding to one was cloned. Moreover, the sites necessary for basal and TNF-inducible transcription have been defined. Remarkably, the requirements for TNF-inducible long MLCK transcription differ in undifferentiated and well differentiated intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that long MLCK transcription can be regulated by multiple mechanisms. These data therefore define regulation of long MLCK transcription under basal conditions as well as following cytokine stimulation and suggest that the factors responsible for long MLCK induction are dependent on cellular differentiation state. Cell Culture and Cytokine Treatment—Caco-2BBE cells (19Peterson M.D. Mooseker M.S. J.

For studies of differentiation and cytokine responses, monolayers grown on Transwell semipermeable supports (Corning-Costar, Acton, MA) were used 3-14 days after reaching confluence, as indicated. Recombinant human IFN-γ and TNF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were routinely added to the basal chamber without manipulating the apical media, as described previously (10Wang F. Graham W.V. Wang Y.

IFN-γ-priming was performed by incubation for 18 h with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ, and TNF was used at 2.5 ng/ml, both in the basal compartment (10Wang F. Graham W.V. Wang Y. Witkowski E.D. Schwarz B.T.

Animal Model—7-10-week-old wild-type C57BL/6 female mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 5 μg of recombinant murine TNF (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline or with phosphate-buffered saline alone, as described previously (16Clayburgh D.R.

Animals were sacrificed 4 h after injection and jejunal epithelia isolated as previously described (16Clayburgh D.R. Barrett T.A. Tang Y. Meddings J.B. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Clarke L.L.

Briefly, a section of intestine was opened length-wise, and washed at 4 °C in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HBSS (CMF-HBSS), transferred to CMF-HBSS containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 50 nm calyculin A (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and transferred to a fresh tube containing CMF-HBSS with 1 mm EDTA and 50 nm calyculin A. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, epithelial cells were dislodged by vigorous shaking, harvested by centrifugation, and placed in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for mRNA analysis or SDS-PAGE sample buffer for immunoblot. Animal studies were carried out in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Chicago. 5′ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′-RACE)—Total RNA was isolated chromatographically from Caco-2BBE cells (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and mRNA was purified on poly-T beads (Qiagen). Antisense primer (5′-GAATCGTCCCATCTGTC-3′) positioned within exon 4 was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis. Subsequent amplification was performed using the 5′-RACE system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Invitrogen). In brief, cDNA was tailed with recombinant TdT and linker (dC) oligonucleotide. 5′-RACE was performed by incubating with an aliquot of first-strand cDNA, a RACE primer positioned within exon 3 (5′-CCGCTGGTGATGGGTTGC-3′), and the abridged anchor primer. PCR conditions were initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, 38 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The final extension step at 72 °C was carried out for 10 min. The resulting products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced to determine the transcriptional start site(s). In Silico Sequence Analysis—Genomic DNA sequences were downloaded from the NCBI data base. In silico transcription factor binding analysis was carried out using the TFSearch program with a threshold of 85. This program searches highly correlated sequence fragments versus the TFMATRIX transcription factor binding site profile data base within the TRANSFAC resources (21Heinemeyer T. Wingender E.

Cloning and Vector Construction—The region from -4105 to -155bp, MLCK (4 kb), and from -4105 to -10 bp, MLCK(+145), relative to the long MLCK transcriptional start site within exon 1A was amplified from human genomic DNA using forward 5′-CCGCTCGAGTGCTATTCAAACAGGAATACAA-3′ and reverse 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTCTGAACTGCAGCAGAGG-3′ or 5′-GGGTGGACTGAGGAGGAAT-3′ primers, respectively. The promoters were verified by direct sequencing and cloned into the pGL3-Basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The 2-kb, 1-kb, 500-bp, and 120-bp promoters were created using the same reverse primer as the 4-kb promoter, and the forward primers 5′-AAGAATGGAAATGACAGAGC-3′, 5′-CACTGTTGCATCAGGGATTA-3′, 5′-ATCCCTGATAGCCAGGAG-3′, and 5′-GTGATGTACTCCTCCCAGCC-3′, respectively. These PCR products were first cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and subsequently sequenced and cloned into pGL3-Basic. Deletion constructs were made by standard restriction digestion and ligation. The Δ(-2416 to -1588), Δ(-2416 to -836), Δ(-2416 to -200) constructs were made by digesting with EcoRI and ApaI, AflII and ApaI, or AleI and ApaI, respectively. Ends were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and then ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The Δ(-1715 to -591), Δ(-417 to -177), and Δ(-530 to -200) constructs were made by digesting with MscI, PstI, or AleI, respectively, and then ligated with T4 DNA ligase. All final constructs were verified by sequencing. Disruption of transcription factor binding sites was done by mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

Complexes were resolved on pre-run 4% native polyacrylamide gels and separated for 2 h at 200 V in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA running buffer. The gels were dried, exposed to film overnight, and used for autoradiography. Real Time RT-PCR—Cell extracts in TRIzol were sonicated, and RNA was extracted with chloroform, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA was further purified using a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated from 2 μg of RNA using Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers in a 25-μl reaction. Long MLCK mRNA expression was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR through 50 cycles using the MyiQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). GAPDH was used as a reference. Primers were 5′-CACCGTCCATGAAAAGAAGAGTAG-3′ and 5′-GAGAGGCCCTGCAGGAAGATGG-3′ for detection of human long MLCK, 5′-GCGTGATCAGCCTGTTCTTTCTAA-3′ and 5′-GCCCCATCTGCCCTTCTTTGACC-3′ for detection of murine long MLCK, and 5′-CTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3′ for detection of human and murine GAPDH. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, as described previously (10Wang F. Graham W.V. Wang Y. Witkowski E.D.

After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence as described previously. Densitometry of immunoblot data were performed using Metamorph 6.2 (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using the EZChIP kit (Upstate Group, Charlottesville, VA). Caco-2 cells grown to differentiation were fixed in 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. 125 mm glycine was added for 5 min to quench unreacted aldehydes. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture II, Upstate Group), scraped, and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, incubated for 10 min on ice, and sonicated four times for 10 s at 8 watts to shear DNA. After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitation used antibodies to Sp1 (Upstate Group), Jun (Cell Signaling Technology), and NFκB (Invitrogen) added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immune complexes were collected on protein G-agarose in a solution containing 0.4 μg/μl sonicated salmon sperm DNA and washed sequentially with low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and finally Tris/EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Immune complexes were eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and 200 mm NaCl) and cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65 °C overnight. RNA was degraded with RNase A for 30 min, and protein was degraded with Proteinase K for 2 h.

TNF Up-regulates Long MLCK Transcription and Protein Expression in Vitro and in Vivo—TNF treatment of IFN-γ-primed Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell monolayers causes barrier dysfunction via increased myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) phosphorylation (10Wang F.

Said H.M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 288: G422-G430Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) have recently shown that these increases in MLC phosphorylation are accompanied by increased long MLC kinase (MLCK) protein expression. Typically, a 1-2-fold increase in MLCK protein, as detected by SDS-PAGE immunoblot, is induced by TNF (Fig. 1A; p < 0.02). Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis shows that this is accompanied by 3.0 ± 0.4-fold increase in long MLCK transcription (Fig. 1B; p < 0.05). To determine whether these TNF-induced increases in MLCK transcription and expression also occur in vivo, mice were injected intraperitoneally with recombinant murine TNF. Jejunal epithelial cells were isolated 4 h after TNF injection and analyzed by SDS-PAGE immunoblot and quantitative real time RT-PCR. MLCK protein content of jejunal epithelial cells increased 4.2 ± 0.5-fold over this period (Fig. 1C, p < 0.01) and MLCK mRNA transcript number increased 3.4 ± 0.8-fold over the same period (Fig. 1D; p < 0.01). Thus, TNF activates long MLCK transcription both in vivo and in vitro. Given that increased MLCK expression is associated with barrier dysfunction (10Wang F. Graham W.V. Wang Y. Witkowski E.D. Schwarz B.T. Turner J.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and has been observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (17Blair S.A. Kane S.V. Clayburgh D.R. Turner J.R. Lab. Investig. 2006; 86: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we sought to identify the regulatory elements that control long MLCK expression. Identification of Multiple Long MLCK 5′-Untranslated Regions and Alternative Transcriptional Start Sites—The data above show that long MLCK expression is transcriptionally up-regulated by TNF. We therefore aimed to define the long MLCK promoter. Although the position of the MLCK transcriptional start site has been proposed based on models of gene structure (22Lazar V. Garcia J.G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), newly identified cDNA sequences (e.g. BC064695) that extend beyond the proposed transcriptional start site have raised uncertainty regarding the accuracy of this identification. We therefore performed 5′-RACE on mRNA isolated from Caco-2 cells using a long MLCK 3′-PCR primer within the coding region of exon 3. Two reaction products were identified and sequenced (DQ642691 and DQ642692). BLAST searches against the human genome localized both of these sequences to the long MLCK (MYLK) gene on chromosome 3q21. Neither has been previously reported among human cDNA sequences. Therefore, these sequences each represent a new transcriptional start site and corresponding first exons, exon 1A and 1B, for long MLCK (Fig. 2A). Notably, the translational start site and coding sequences, located within exon 2, were identical for the two transcripts. The portion of exon 3 within each sequence was also identical. Thus exons 1A and 1B represent alternative transcriptional start sites for long MLCK in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. In Silico Analysis of Putative Long MLCK Promoters—The"
https://openalex.org/W2005353089,"Hydrolysis of acetylcholine catalyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), one of the most efficient enzymes in nature, occurs at the base of a deep and narrow active center gorge. At the entrance of the gorge, the peripheral anionic site provides a binding locus for allosteric ligands, including substrates. To date, no structural information on substrate entry to the active center from the peripheral site of AChE or its subsequent egress has been reported. Complementary crystal structures of mouse AChE and an inactive mouse AChE mutant with a substituted catalytic serine (S203A), in various complexes with four substrates (acetylcholine, acetylthiocholine, succinyldicholine, and butyrylthiocholine), two non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues (m-(N,N,N-trimethylammonio)-trifluoroacetophenone and 4-ketoamyltrimethylammonium), and one reaction product (choline) were solved in the 2.05-2.65-Å resolution range. These structures, supported by binding and inhibition data obtained on the same complexes, reveal the successive positions and orientations of the substrates bound to the peripheral site and proceeding within the gorge toward the active site, the conformations of the presumed transition state for acylation and the acyl-enzyme intermediate, and the positions and orientations of the dissociating and egressing products. Moreover, the structures of the AChE mutant in complexes with acetylthiocholine and succinyldicholine reveal additional substrate binding sites on the enzyme surface, distal to the gorge entry. Hence, we provide a comprehensive set of structural snapshots of the steps leading to the intermediates of catalysis and the potential regulation by substrate binding to various allosteric sites at the enzyme surface. Hydrolysis of acetylcholine catalyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), one of the most efficient enzymes in nature, occurs at the base of a deep and narrow active center gorge. At the entrance of the gorge, the peripheral anionic site provides a binding locus for allosteric ligands, including substrates.

Neuron. 1990; 5: 317-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), is located centrosymmetric to the subunit and at the base of a deep and narrow gorge (4Sussman J.L. Harel M.

Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). AChE-catalyzed hydrolysis of ACh and other carboxyl esters proceeds via formation of an initial noncovalent enzyme-substrate complex. Nucleophilic attack of the substrate carbonyl carbon by the Ser203 hydroxyl generates a transient tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate, which collapses into a short-lived (t½ ∼ 50 μs) acyl-enzyme (ester) intermediate and a released choline molecule (6Froede H.C. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11010-11013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deacylation through hydrolytic attack on the ester carbonyl by a water molecule leads to a second tetrahedral intermediate, which then collapses into a regenerated enzyme and an acetate molecule. Rapid rates of substrate association and choline product dissociation contribute to the AChE high specific activity and catalytic throughput. Ser203 is rendered more nucleophilic by catalytic triad residues Glu334 and His447. Residue Trp86, located at the very base of the active center gorge, orients the ACh trimethylammonium group prior to hydrolysis, whereas the oxyanion hole amide hydrogens from Gly121, Gly122, and Ala204, presumably stabilize the carbonyl oxygen of ACh in the transition states for acylation and deacylation. Inhibitors of AChE bind to the active site or to the peripheral anionic site (PAS), an allosteric site located at the active center gorge entrance, or they span the two sites thereby occupying much of the active center gorge (7Changeux J.P.

Competitive displacement, by ACh, of the specific PAS ligands, propidium and the peptidic toxin fasciculin, provides evidence that ACh binds the PAS in addition to the active site (10Radić Z.

Electrostatic calculations based on the TcAChE structure and subsequent molecular dynamics simulation suggested that AChE may also have a “back door,” distinct from the gorge entrance and whose transient opening would contribute to the high rate of traffic of substrates, products, and water into and out of the active center gorge (27Axelsen P.H.

Opening of this putative door would involve a displacement of the Trp86 side chain, which constitutes the thin wall separating the choline binding site in the active site from the outside solvent. Existence of residual catalytic activity of AChE complexes with the large fasciculin molecule, which binds the PAS to seal the gorge entrance (5Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P.

To date, the functioning of the back door remains hypothetical and, apart from some speculation (32Bartolucci C. Perola E. Cellai L. Brufani M. Lamba D.

Although a structural perspective on the AChE catalytic mechanism should include the acylation and deacylation steps and related intermediates, the rapid substrate turnover precludes their entrapment and visualization in a crystalline state.

To enhance the opportunity of observing intact substrate molecules bound with high occupancies at the various sites, we expressed a catalytically inactive mAChE mutant, S203A, and crystallized it together with the wild type mAChE in a form that keeps potential ligand binding sites at the enzyme surface free of packing contacts (19Bourne Y.

We then soaked the crystals in concentrated solutions of the substrates ACh and acetylthiocholine (ATCh), the slowly hydrolyzable substrates succinyldicholine (SCh) and butyrylthiocholine (BTCh), the non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues TMTFA and 4-ketoamyltrimethylammonium (4K-TMA), and the reaction product choline (Scheme 1). The eight resulting crystalline complexes and conjugates, supported by binding and inhibition data, show complementary views of the transition state, the acyl-enzyme and the deacetylated enzyme, and substrate binding to the PAS. In addition, substrate binding sites remote from the active site and the PAS were identified. Hence these structures provide a comprehensive set of snapshots of the reaction intermediates along the gorge pathway and the likely modes of regulation by substrate binding to low affinity sites at the enzyme surface.

The enzyme and mutant were extensively dialyzed against 1 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 1 m NaCl, 40 mm MgCl2, 0.01% NaN3 (w/v), and desalted by gel-filtration FPLC on Superdex-200 (Amersham Biosciences) in 1 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% NaN3 (w/v) (crystallization buffer), or by extensive dialysis against this buffer.

The other seven complexes were generated by crystal soaking, carried out at 4 °C in sitting drops (20 μl) made of the well solution supplemented with the ligand (250 mm) and polyethylene glycol up to 35% (∼0.6 m) to ensure cryoprotection; the soaking drops were renewed twice at 12-h intervals and again just before direct crystal flash-cooling in the nitrogen gas stream.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The apo-mAChE structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1J06 (19Bourne Y. Taylor P. Radić Z. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar)) without solvent was used as a starting model to refine the reported structures with REFMAC (46Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J.

Typically, rigid-body refinement was first performed on each of the two subunits forming the crystalline mAChE dimer (19Bourne Y. Taylor P. Radić Z. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) using all data followed by cycles of restrained refinements. Random sets of reflections were set aside for cross-validation purposes. For each structure, the resulting σA-weighted 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps were used to position the ligand. Automated solvent building was performed with ARP/wARP (47Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) and manual adjustment with the graphics program TURBO-FRODO (66Roussel A. Cambillau C.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar). The final structures, one apo-S203A and eight S203A or mAChE complexes, comprise residues Glu1-Thr543 and Glu4-Thr543 for the two mAChE/S203A molecules in the asymmetric unit, respectively, and GlcNAc moieties linked to Asn350 and Asn464. High temperature factors and weak electron densities are observed for residues within the surface loop region Asp491-Pro498. The average root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation value between the nine structures and the apo-mAChE structure is 0.24 Å for 535 Cα atoms (from 0.19 Å for the SCh-mAChE complex to 0.294 Å for the 4K-TMA-mAChE complex). The stereochemistries of the structures were analyzed with PROCHECK (49Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar); with the exception of residue Ser/Ala203, no residues were found in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The atomic coordinates and structure factors of the four S203A (ACh, ATCh, SCh, and BTCh) and four mAChE complexes (TMTFA, 4K-TMA, SCh, and choline) have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (Table 1). Figures were generated with PyMOL (50DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Inhibition and Binding Studies—Inhibition by SCh, 4K-TMA, and choline of mAChE-catalyzed ATCh hydrolysis was measured spectrophotometrically (51Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Feather-Stone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21126) Google Scholar) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 22 °C. The inhibition constants, Ki and αKi, were determined from the dependence of slopes and y intercepts of Lineweaver-Burk plots on inhibitor concentration (15Radić Z. Pickering N.A. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Binding of ligands ACh, ATCh, SCh, BTCh, 4K-TMA, and choline to mAChE (200 nm) and the S203A mutant (100 nm) was measured from the dependence of the pseudo-first order association rate, kobs, of the reversible bisquaternary inhibitors ambenonium (2 or 5 μm) (52Hodge A.S. Humphrey D.R. Rosenberry T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 937-942PubMed Google Scholar) or decidium (1 μm) (53Berman H.A. Decker M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 872: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) on ligand concentration (from 1 μm to 30 mm for 4K-TMA and to 300 mm for the other ligands). Rates were monitored in a millisecond time frame by stopped-flow measurements of intrinsic Trp fluorescence quenching of mAChE or its mutant as described (54Radić Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4622-4633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Dissociation constants, Kd, were determined from semi-logarithmic plots of kobs versus ligand concentration ([L]) and calculated by nonlinear regression using Equation 1, kobs=kobs0/(1+[L]/Kd)(Eq. 1) where kobs0 is the pseudo-first order rate constant for ambenonium or decidium association in the absence of ligand. When kobs versus [L] plots were biphasic, two dissociation constants, Kd and KdL, characterizing ligand binding to the enzyme and the enzyme-ligand complex, respectively, were calculated using Equation 2, kobs=(kobs0-kobsL,0)/(1+[L]/Kd)+kobsL,0/(1+[L]/KdL)(Eq. 2) where kobsL,0 is the limiting first-order rate constant for competitor association with the enzyme-ligand complex. The 2.65-Å resolution structure of the S203A mutant, compared with apo-mAChE (r.m.s. deviation value: 0.26 Å for 535 Cα atoms), shows an undisrupted catalytic site architecture despite the absence of the Ser hydroxyl, as well as unaltered topography for the PAS region (Fig. 1). Soaking a S203A crystal with 50 mm ATCh (∼103 × Km and 4 × Kss for mAChE; ∼50 × Kd for the mutant; Table 2) led to a 2.25-Å resolution structure in which only the reaction products thiocholine (TCh) and acetate were found, well ordered and with high occupancy, in the active center gorge (not shown). Despite the small size of choline, the side chain of Tyr337, located in the constricted region of the gorge, was found rotated by 24° and"
https://openalex.org/W2054673335,"Hint1 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved family of histidine triad proteins that acts as a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor inducing spontaneous tumor formation in Hint+/- and Hint-/- mouse models. However, the molecular mechanisms for the tumor-suppressing activity are poorly defined. In this respect, we have recently shown that Hint1, by interaction with Pontin and Reptin, inhibits T-cell factor/β-catenin-mediated transcription of Wnt target genes. In this study, we have found that, after transient transfection with Hint1, SW480 and MCF-7 cells undergo apoptosis as analyzed by pro-caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, M30 CytoDEATH staining, cytochrome c release, and DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hint1 is involved in the regulation of apoptotic pathways by inducing an up-regulation of p53 expression coinciding with an up-regulation of the proapoptotic factor Bax and a concomitant down-regulation of the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2. Bad and Puma levels remained unchanged. Further analyses revealed that Hint1 is associated with the Bax promoter and is a component of the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase complex and, in this context, appears to be involved in the regulation of Bax expression. Knockdown of Hint1 by short hairpin RNA resulted in down-regulation of p53 and Bax but had no effect on Bcl-2 expression. A mutant Hint1 (H112N) protein defective in enzymatic activity as an AMP-NH2 hydrolase was not impaired in induction of apoptosis, suggesting that the Hint1 pro-apoptotic activity is independent of the Hint1 enzymatic activity."

The role of this pathway in lung tumorigenesis has not been clearly established. Recent studies from our laboratory indicate that combined expression of the combination of Wnt 7a and Frizzled 9 (Fzd 9) in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell lines inhibits transformed growth. We have also shown that increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) inhibits transformed growth of NSCLC and promotes epithelial differentiation of these cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether the effects of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 were mediated through PPARγ. We found that Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 expression led to increased PPARγ activity. This effect was not mediated by altered expression of the protein. Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 expression resulted in activation of ERK5, which was required for PPARγ activation in NSCLC. SR 202, a known PPARγ inhibitor, blocked the increase in PPARγ activity and restored anchorage-independent growth in NSCLC expressing Wnt 7a and Fzd 9. SR 202 also reversed the increase in E-cadherin expression mediated by Wnt 7a and Fzd 9. These data suggest that ERK5-dependent activation of PPARγ represents a major effector pathway mediating the anti-tumorigenic effects of Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 in NSCLC.

These findings unveil a novel tumor suppressor pathway in lung cancer and implicate Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 in the maintenance of epithelial cellular differentiation. The downstream effector pathways mediating these effects are not well understood. Proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a member of the PPAR family of ligand-activated nuclear receptors implicated in a wide variety of biological functions (7Feige J.N. Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 120-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Three PPAR isoforms have been identified, α, γ, and β/δ, which all bind as heterodimers with the retinoic acid X receptor to specific regulatory elements in the promoter regions of their target genes. The role of PPARγ has been extensively studied in a variety of cancers including colon, breast, prostate, and lung (see Ref. 8Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar for review). Inactivating mutations in the PPARγ gene have been seen in colon cancers (9Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Our laboratories have demonstrated that overexpression of PPARγ in NSCLC inhibited transformed growth and metastasis of NSCLC and promoted epithelial differentiation (14Wick M. Hurteau G. Dessev C.

Because both Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 and PPARγ appeared to have similar tumor-suppressive effects on NSCLC, we postulated that they represented components of a common signaling pathway and that the cell surface genes Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 were likely upstream of the nuclear receptor gene PPARγ. The current study demonstrates that Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 signaling leads to the stimulation of PPARγ through activation of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 5 (ERK-5). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PPARγ reversed the anti-tumorigenic effects of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9. Cell Culture and Retrovirus-mediated Gene Transfer—NSCLC lines of the adenocarcinoma (H2122) and squamous (H157) phenotype were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Stable transfectants H157-LNCX-LPCX, H157-Wnt-7a/Fzd-9, H2122-LPCX, H2122-Fzd-9, and H157-LNCX, H157-PPARγ, H2122-LNCX, and H2122-PPARγ were prepared using retroviral-mediated gene transfer as previously described (6Winn R.A.

Wnt-7a cDNAs inserted into pCDNA3 encoding a C-terminal hemagglutinin epitope were kindly provided by Dr. Jan Kitajewski (Columbia University). The cDNA encoding mouse Frizzled 9 (mFzd-9) was provided by Dr. Terry Van Raay (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine). Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Aliquots of the RNA (10 μg) were converted to cDNA with Superscript II (Invitrogen) and random hexamers according to the manufacturer's specifications. Primer sets for the quantitative PCR of human PPARγ and GAPDH are as follows: PPARγ (forward, 5′-CAT AAT GCC ATC AGG TTT GG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCA GCG GAC TCT GGA TTC AG-3′). GAPDH (forward, 5′-GCC AAA TAT GAT GAC ATC AAG AAG G-3′; reverse, 5′-GGT GTC GCT GTT GAA GTC AGA G-3′. Aliquots (1 μl) of reverse transcription reactions were subjected to PCR using the following conditions: 95 °C × 10 min, followed by 95 °C × 15 s and 60 °C × 1 min for 40 cycles in 50-μl reactions with SYBR® Green Jumpstart Taq Readymix (Sigma). Initial real-time PCR amplification products were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels to verify that the primer pairs amplified a single product of the predicted size. GAPDH mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR in the samples as a control gene. The real-time PCR data were analyzed with the Smart Cycler® software (version 1.2d) to calculate the threshold cycle values for the different samples and are presented as mRNA levels in arbitrary units. Transient Transfections and Reporter Luciferase Assays—The reporter plasmids (PPAR-RE, PDRE, and E-cadherin promoter-luciferase), expression plasmids (Wnt 7a, Fzd 9, wild-type PPARγ, wild-type PPARδ, and DN-MEK-5), and β-galactosidase control plasmids were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were transfected with either 2 μg of PPAR-RE, PDRE (gift from Dr. Kenneth Kinzler, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine), dominant negative MEK-5, or E-cadherin promoter-luciferase (gift from Dr. Eric Fearon, University of Michigan), and 1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase for determination of transfection efficiency. For studies employing pharmacological inhibitors, agents were added 24 h after transfection and cells were harvested 48 h later. Inhibitors used were the MEK inhibitors PD98059 (Sigma) and U0126 (Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), and the PPARγ inhibitor SR202 (Ilex Oncology, San Antonio, TX). Cells were collected, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 250 μl of Luciferase Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). The cell lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge and aliquots (80 μl) of the supernatants assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as previously described (6Winn R.A. Marek L.

Cell extracts were prepared in MAP kinase lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml aprotinin) as previously described (16Winn R.A.

Aliquots of the different extracts were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) and 3% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with the same blocking solution containing the indicated antibodies at 1 μg/ml for 12–16 h. For immunoblotting of phosopho-ERK-5, filters were blocked in TTBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The filters were extensively washed in TTBS, and bound antibodies were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies and LumiPhos reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's directions. Soft Agar Colony Formation—For measurement of anchorage-independent cell growth, 5,000 cells were plated in triplicate in 35-mm wells of a six-well plate in a volume of 1.5 ml of growth medium containing 0.3% nobel agar onto a base of 1.5 ml of growth medium containing 0.5% agar. The plates were incubated in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 21 days. Colonies were stained for 5–12 h at 37 °C with nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (1 mg/ml), visualized under a microscope, and counted. Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 Activate PPARγ in NSCLC Cell Lines—H157 and H2122 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector, Wnt 7a, and/or Fzd 9 or wild-type PPARγ along with a vector encoding three copies of a PPAR response element (PPAR-RE) linked to firefly luciferase. In H157 cells, which lack both Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 (6Winn R.A. Marek L. Han S.Y. Rodriguez K. Rodriguez N. Hammond M. Van Scoyk M. Acosta H. Mirus J. Barry N. Bren-Mattison Y. Van Raay T.J. Nemenoff R.A. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19625-19634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), simultaneous expression of both proteins led to a marked increase in PPAR-RE activity (Fig. 1, left panel). In H2122 cells, which express endogenous Wnt 7a, transient expression of Fzd 9 increased PPAR-RE activity 8-fold (right panel). Increases in PPARγ activity were also seen in both cell lines in response to expression of PPARγ. Co-expression of Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 with PPARγ resulted in a synergistic increase in PPARγ activity (Fig. 1). By contrast, co-expression of other Wnts (1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6) and Fzd 9 failed to significantly increase PPAR-RE (data not shown). Similarly, co-expression of Wnt7a with Fzd 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 8 failed to increase PPAR-RE activity (data not shown). We also examined activity of PPAR-RE in cells stably expressing Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 or PPARγ. As shown in Fig. 2A, similar increases were observed in these stable transfectants. Interestingly, stable expression of PPARδ failed to increase PPAR-RE activity in either cell line, confirming that this activity is due to PPARγ. To confirm the specificity of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 on PPAR isoforms, we measured the activity of a transiently transfected PPARδ-specific promoter (PDRE) reporter (17He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Expression of PPARδ, but not PPARγ, increased PDRE promoter activity (Fig. 2B), demonstrating the specificity of these PPAR-RE and PDRE luciferase reporters for PPARγ and PPARδ, respectively. Expression of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 in H157 cells or Fzd 9 in H2122 cells had no effect on PDRE activity (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data indicate that expression of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 results in increased PPARγ activity.FIGURE 2Stably transfected Wnt 7a and Fzd 9, but not wild-type PPARδ, stimulate PPAR-RE activity. A, H157 cells stably transfected with empty vectors, LNCX and LPCX, Wnt 7a and Fzd 9, wild-type PPARγ, or wild-type PPARδ were transiently transfected with PPAR-RE and pCMV-β-galactosidase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were incubated for 72 h, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured.

Our quantitative reverse transcription PCR experiments revealed that stable expression of Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 in either H157 or H2122 had no significant effect on PPARγ mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). This was confirmed by immunoblotting, where stable expression of Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 failed to cause a significant increase in the PPARγ expression (Fig. 3B). As a positive control, stable expression of wild-type PPARγ resulted in a marked increase in PPARγ protein and mRNA expression. These data indicate that Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 activation of PPARγ is not mediated through increased expression but by activation of PPARγ. Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 Activation of PPARγ Is Mediated through Activation of ERK5—Previous studies have demonstrated that ERK5 is capable of mediating PPARγ transcriptional activation in endothelial cells (18Akaike M. Che W. Marmarosh N.L. Ohta S. Osawa M. Ding B. Berk B.C. Yan C. Abe J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8691-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that ERK5 stimulates activation of PPARγ in NSCLC, we examined the effect of Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 expression in both H157 and H2122 cell lines on ERK5 phosphorylation by immunoblotting with a phospho-ERK5-specific antibody. Expression of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 resulted in a 5- to 10-fold increase in pERK5 relative to the empty vector control cell lines (Fig. 4A). The levels of total ERK5 were not changed (Fig. 4A, lower panels). Under these conditions we did not observe any significant increase in ERK1/2 activity, either by blotting with a phospho-ERK antibody (Fig. 4A) or by direct measurement of ERK1/2 kinase activity (data not shown). We also examined the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of the ERK family of MAP kinases. PD 98059 (25 μm), a known MEK inhibitor, decreased expression of phospho-ERK1, 2, and 5 on immunoblot (Fig. 4A), consistent with what has been previously reported (19Cameron S.J. Malik S. Akaike M.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Exposure of either H157 or H2122 cells to this concentration of PD98059 had no effect on basal PPARγ activity in control cells transfected with empty vector but potently inhibited the increase seen in cells expressing Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 (Fig. 4B). Because these results do not rule out a role for ERK1/2 in regulation of PPARγ activity, we employed a second MEK inhibitor, U0126. This agent inhibited MEK1/2 but did not affect MEK5 activity at the concentration used in this study (10 μm) (Fig. 4, A and B) (21Mody N. Leitch J. Armstrong C. Dixon J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The addition of U1026 to the various cell lines did not lead to a reduction of phospho-ERK5 protein expression or PPAR-RE reporter activity in either the H157 Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 or H2122 Fzd 9 cell lines (Fig. 4, A and B). From these studies, we propose that increased PPARγ activity is mediated through activation of MEK5/ERK5. This finding is consistent with the lack of an effect of Wnt7a/Fzd 9 on ERK1/2 activity (6Winn R.A. Marek L. Han S.Y. Rodriguez K. Rodriguez N. Hammond M. Van Scoyk M. Acosta H. Mirus J. Barry N. Bren-Mattison Y. Van Raay T.J. Nemenoff R.A. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19625-19634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To determine the role of ERK5 in activating PPARγ, we co-expressed dominant negative MEK5 an inhibitor of ERK5 with Wnt7a and Fzd 9. Expression of dominant negative MEK5 had no effect on basal PPAR-RE activity but inhibited the activation stimulated by expression of Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 in both the H157 and H2122 cell lines. In H157 cells, PPARγ activity was decreased by ∼60%, whereas in H2122 cells the decrease was >90% (Fig. 4C). Wnt 7A and Fzd 9 Expression Results in Reduced Expression of the PPARγ Co-repressor SMRT—Past studies have shown that PPARγ activity is inhibited by the co-repressors silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) and NCor (18Akaike M. Che W. Marmarosh N.L. Ohta S. Osawa M. Ding B. Berk B.C. Yan C. Abe J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8691-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Perissi V. Aggarwal A. Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 511-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Activation of PPARγ by ligands is associated with displacement of co-repressors by coactivators, which is mediated through ubiquitination of co-repressors, and subsequent degradation via the proteasome pathway. To determine whether this mechanism was involved in activation of PPARγ by Wnt 7a/Fzd9, we examined expression of SMRT. Co-expression of Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 in NSCLC significantly reduced the protein expression of SMRT (Fig. 5). A PPARγ Inhibitor SR 202 Blocks the Effects of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 on Transformed Growth of NSCLC—The role of PPARγ in mediating the effects of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 on transformed growth of NSCLC was assessed using a recently described pharmacological antagonist, SR202 (23Rieusset J. Touri F. Michalik L. Escher P. Desvergne B. Niesor E. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2628-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Santini E. Fallahi P. Ferrari S.M. Masoni A. Antonelli A. Ferrannini E. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S79-S83Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To confirm the efficacy of this drug, H2122 cells, either stably expressing Fzd 9 or empty vector, were transiently transfected with the PPAR-RE-luciferase construct in the presence or absence of SR202 (20 μm). Exposure to SR202 completely prevented the increase in PPARγ activity seen with Fzd 9 expression (Fig. 6A), confirming our earlier conclusion that Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 selectively activate PPARγ. We next assessed the effects of this agent on colony formation in soft agar, a measure of transformed growth. Consistent with our earlier findings, expression of Fzd 9 in H2122 cells (6Winn R.A. Marek L. Han S.Y. Rodriguez K. Rodriguez N. Hammond M. Van Scoyk M. Acosta H. Mirus J. Barry N. Bren-Mattison Y. Van Raay T.J. Nemenoff R.A. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19625-19634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) strongly inhibited colony formation (Fig. 6B). Treatment with SR202 had no effect on colony formation in control cells transfected with empty vector. However, exposure to SR202 reversed the inhibition of colony formation seen with expression of Fzd 9 and resulted in ∼50% of the number of colonies seen in control cells (Fig. 6, B and C). These data indicate that blocking PPARγ activation partially reverses the inhibitory effects of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9, suggesting that PPARγ is a major effector pathway downstream from Wnt 7a/Fzd 9. E-cadherin Is Reduced in Cell Lines Expressing Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 by the PPARγ Inhibitor Compound SR 202—E-cadherin is a well known marker of epithelial differentiation (25Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar, 26Thiery J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that E-cadherin is induced by both Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 and PPARγ expression in NSCLC (6Winn R.A. Marek L. Han S.Y. Rodriguez K. Rodriguez N. Hammond M. Van Scoyk M. Acosta H.

Winn R. Geraci M.W. Nemenoff R.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1412-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We evaluated the effects of the PPARγ antagonist SR202 on NSCLC cell lines expressing Wnt 7a/Fzd 9. Expression of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 resulted in a 5- to 10-fold increase in E-cadherin expression relative to the empty vector control cell lines, consistent with previous findings (Fig. 7A). The addition of SR202 to the cell lines expressing Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 resulted in a marked reduction of E-cadherin in both H157 and H2122 cells. Total β-catenin was used as a loading control (Fig. 7A, bottom panels). We confirmed these findings by examining effects on the E-cadherin promoter (27Hajra K.M. Chen D.Y. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar). H157 and H2122 cells, either stably expressing Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 or empty vector, were transiently transfected with the E-cadherin-luciferase construct in the presence or absence of SR202. Wnt7a and Fzd 9 signaling stimulated E-cadherin promoter activity 5- to 10-fold, and SR202 inhibited this increase by >50% (Fig. 7B). These data indicate that regulation of E-cadherin is controlled by transcriptional regulation. Deregulation of the Wnt pathway plays a key role in the development of various tumors (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mazieres J. He B. You L. Xu Z. Jablons D.M. Cancer Lett. 2005; 222: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 28Jansson E.A. Are A. Greicius G. Kuo I.C. Kelly D. Arulampalam V. Pettersson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; Google Scholar). Whereas the canonical Wnt pathway has been demonstrated to be pro-tumorigenic, Wnt 7a is critical for the formation of normal epithelium in development and plays a significant role in maintaining a normal epithelial phenotype in the lungs of adults (29Kirikoshi H. Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 21: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). Wnt 7a is frequently lost in NSCLC (6Winn R.A. Marek L. Han S.Y. Rodriguez K. Rodriguez N. Hammond M. Van Scoyk M. Acosta H. Mirus J.

Marek L. Han S.Y. Rodriguez K. Rodriguez N. Hammond M. Van Scoyk M. Acosta H. Mirus J. Barry N. Bren-Mattison Y. Van Raay T.J. Nemenoff R.A. Heasley L.E. J. Biol.

Nemenoff R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and others have shown that thiazolidinediones, which are pharmacological activators of PPARγ, inhibit growth and promote increased differentiation in various types of tumors, including NSCLC (31Demetri G.D. Fletcher C.D. Mueller E. Sarraf P. Naujoks R. Campbell N. Spiegelman B.M. Singer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 32Nemenoff R.A. Winn R.A. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 2561-2568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have also shown that increased PPARγ activity, induced by overexpression of PPARγ, inhibited transformed growth and increased expression of epithelial markers in H2122 and H157 cells (15Bren-Mattison Y. Van Putten V. Chan D. Winn R. Geraci M.W. Nemenoff R.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1412-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the current study we have demonstrated that these two pathways are linked. Specifically, expression of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 leads to a marked increase in PPARγ activity. Furthermore, blocking PPARγ with a pharmacological inhibitor reverses both the inhibition of transformed growth and the induction of E-cadherin expression seen with Wnt 7a/Fzd 9, implying that activation of PPARγ is a major effector pathway in mediating the anti-tumorigenic effects of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 in NSCLC. Because Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 did not significantly increase expression of either PPARγ mRNA or protein, our data support a mechanism in which Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 activate PPARγ through a post-translational mechanism involving activation of ERK5. ERK5 is a member of the MAP kinase family that is activated by redox and hyperosmotic stress, growth factors, and pathways involving certain G-protein-coupled receptors (20Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 33Fukuhara S. Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21730-21736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ERK5 has a dual phosphorylation site like ERK1/2 but has a unique loop-12 structure and a large carboxyl-terminal, suggesting that its regulation and function may be different from that of ERK1/2 (34Hayashi M. Lee J.D. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, flow-mediated activation of ERK5 has been shown to lead to activation of PPARγ by direct binding to the hinge-helix region of PPARγ (18Akaike M. Che W. Marmarosh N.L. Ohta S. Osawa M. Ding B. Berk B.C. Yan C. Abe J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8691-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This activation requires phosphorylation of ERK5 by the upstream activating kinase MEK5. Our data are consistent with this model, because expression of dominant negative MEK5 and pharmacological inhibition of MEK5 blocked the activation of PPARγ activity by Wnt 7a/Fzd 9. It has been demonstrated that ERK1/2 phosphorylates PPARγ on serine 82, which is in the AF1 region of the molecule (35Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 36Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. g. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation inhibits transcriptional activation by decreasing the affinity for ligand (37Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of ERK1/2 would not be expected to decrease PPARγ activity. The effects of ERK5 could be mediated by controlling the association of PPARγ with co-repressors. Studies have shown that activation of MEK5/ERK5 caused displacement of silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), a potent transcriptional co-repressor of PPARγ (38Yu C. Markan K. Temple K.A. Deplewski D. Brady M.J. Cohen R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13600-13605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), resulting in PPARγ transcriptional activation (18Akaike M. Che W. Marmarosh N.L. Ohta S. Osawa M. Ding B. Berk B.C. Yan C. Abe J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8691-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly we have observed that Wnt 7a and Fzd 9 expression leads to reduced SMRT protein expression by immunoblotting (Fig. 5). This is an attractive model of activation of PPARγ, and in the absence of increases in PPARγ mRNA and protein expression could potentially account for PPARγ activation. Wnt activation of PPARγ has been demonstrated in colon cancer cells (28Jansson E.A. Are A. Greicius G. Kuo I.C. Kelly D. Arulampalam V. Pettersson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; Google Scholar). In these studies, pro-tumorigenic signaling through Wnts resulted in increased expression of PPARγ by a post-transcriptional effect. Overexpression of β-catenin also increased PPARγ, indicating that this effect was mediated through the canonical Wnt pathway (28Jansson E.A. Are A. Greicius G. Kuo I.C. Kelly D. Arulampalam V. Pettersson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; Google Scholar). The biological effects of PPARγ in colon cancer remain controversial, with studies supporting both pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles. In contrast, studies in lung cancer, including data from our laboratory, support an anti-tumorigenic role for PPARγ. Furthermore, we have shown that Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 signaling is not mediated through the canonical Wnt pathway (6Winn R.A. Marek L. Han S.Y. Rodriguez K. Rodriguez N. Hammond M. Van Scoyk M. Acosta H. Mirus J. Barry N. Bren-Mattison Y. Van Raay T.J. Nemenoff R.A. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19625-19634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), indicating that the mechanisms of PPARγ induction are cell context specific. Our studies using the pharmacological PPARγ inhibitor do not show a complete reversal of the effects of Wnt 7a/Fzd 9, and this may be due to other effector pathways that are independent of PPARγ. In this regard, we have previously demonstrated that Wnt 7a/Fzd 9 expression leads to activation of the JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase) pathway and increased expression of Sprouty-4 in NSCLC (6Winn R.A. Marek L. Han S.Y. Rodriguez K. Rodriguez N. Hammond M. Van Scoyk M. Acosta H. Mirus J. Barry N. Bren-Mattison Y. Van Raay T.J. Nemenoff R.A. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19625-19634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is likely that these pathways cooperate with activation of PPARγ in reversing the transformed phenotype. In summary, these data demonstrate a novel connection between Wnt signaling and activation of PPARγ in lung cancer. Our data as well as those of others raise the possibility that PPARγ activators may represent an effective treatment of patients with lung cancer. As with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, these agents may be targeted to specific subpopulations of lung cancer cells that lack either Wnt 7a or Fzd 9. Our data would suggest that more specific pharmacological activators of ERK5 or PPARγ might have utility in the treatment of lung cancer."

Using an expression cloning strategy, we identified transgelin (SM22), a 22-25-kDa actin-binding protein localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm, as a novel regulator of MMP-9 expression. Overexpression of a SM22 cDNA in HT1080 cells decreased MMP-9 mRNA/protein levels and diminished in vitro invasion of the latter rescued with exogenous MMP-9. Conversely, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of SM22 elevated MMP-9 synthesis, and uterus from SM22-null mice showed strong MMP-9 immunoreactivity compared with wild type animals. The ability of SM22 to repress MMP-9 expression required an intact amino terminus calponin homology domain. MMP-9 expression is driven by ERK signaling and SM22 targeted this pathway as evidenced by (a) the transience in MAPK activation and (b) blunted stimulation of the MMP-9 promoter by a constitutively active MEK expression vector. Progressive deletion analysis located the SM22 responsive region of the MMP-9 promoter to the proximal 90-bp region harboring an AP-1 motif subsequently implicated by site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, nuclear extract from the SM22 transfectants showed diminished c-Fos binding to this motif and SM22 expression reduced the activity of an AP-1-driven reporter by 75%. Thus, SM22 adds to a short list of repressors of MMP-9 expression, achieving this by reducing AP-1-dependent trans-activation of the gene by way of compromised ERK activation. Diminished transgelin expression in several cancers may thus partly account for the elevated MMP-9 expression evident in these tumors.

Similarly, in bone development, migration of osteoclasts into cartilage matrix is dependent on their expression of this metalloproteinase and defective endochondral bone formation is evident in mice null for this metalloproteinase (4Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). MMP-9 also plays a key role in angiogenesis with knock-out mice manifesting abnormal skeletal growth plate vascularization (5Vu T.H. Shipley J.M. Bergers G. Berger J.E. Helms J.A. Hanahan D.

In cancer, MMP-9 enhances tumor progression in some, but not all, malignancies. In an earlier study, expression of an anti-MMP-9 ribozyme effectively blocked metastasis of rat sarcoma cells (6Hua J. Muschel R.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5279-5284PubMed Google Scholar), whereas, more recently, in an elegant series of experiments primary tumor growth, angiogenesis, and lung metastasis were diminished in animals null for this collagenase (7Hiratsuka S.

Recent studies also indicate a function of MMP-9 in cell transformation (8Dechow T.N. Pedranzinin L. Leithch A. Leslie K. Gerald W.L. Linkov I. Bromberg J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Surprisingly, MMP-9 can also suppress tumor progression depending on the tumor type and/or stage with siRNA 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. targeting this metalloproteinase yielding increased intravasation and metastasis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay (9Deryugina E.I.

The original proposal that MMP-9 solely functions in the cleavage of extracellular matrix components including elastin, type III, IV, and V collagen (10Murphy G. Cockett M.I. Ward R.V. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) has had to be broadened in light of recent findings. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly evident that MMP-9 is a multifunctional protein that also regulates angiogenesis (11Handsley M.M. Edwards D.R. Int. J.

Furthermore, transformation of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells by constitutively active Stat-3-C requires MMP-9 and indeed the amounts of the transcription factor and metalloproteinase correlate in primary breast cancer specimens (8Dechow T.N.

MMP-9 expression is largely controlled by transcription of the gene encoded on chromosome 20 (15Linn R. DuPont B.R. Knight C.B. Plaetke R. Leach R.J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 72: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), although mRNA stability (16Iyer V. Pumiglia K. DiPersio C.M. J.

The activity of MMP-9, in turn, is titrated by the endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1-3 (28Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol.

Olmeda D. Vinyals A. Valero E. Cubillo E. Llorens A. Cano A. Fabra A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3371-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Additionally, MMP-9 expression is a target of the Wnt pathway as evidenced by the ability of Frizzled-related protein 3, a secreted Wnt antagonist, to suppress MMP-9 expression and PC-3 prostate cancer cell invasiveness (35Zi X. Guo Y. Simoneau A.R. Hope C. Xie J. Holcombe R.F. Hoang B.H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9762-9770Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Conversely, the metastases suppressor Kiss-1 is one of the few negative regulators of MMP-9 expression identified to date achieving this repression by down-regulating NF-κB translocation (36Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, so far, there have been no genome-wide studies to identify novel regulators of MMP-9 expression in a systematic manner. Considering the important role of MMP-9 in physiology and pathology we have employed expression cloning to identify hitherto unknown regulators of expression of this collagenase. We report herein SM22 (transgelin) as a novel regulator of MMP-9 expression repressing its expression by interfering with ERK activation and AP-1 signaling. Cell Culture—HT-1080 cells were maintained in McCoys 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. WI-38 and VA-13 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For stable transfections, cells were transfected at ∼80% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Briefly, the cells were transfected with 8 μg of DNA and 24 μg of Lipofectamine 2000 for 24 h, after which the transfection mixture was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were incubated for another 48 h and then selected with 1 mg/ml of G418. Clones were isolated, expanded, and screened for SM22 expression. Constructs—The pQE-30 bacterial expression vector harboring the SM22 cDNA fragments (1-201, 1-186, 1-166, and 1-151) was used as template to PCR amplify (with Pfu Turbo) and subclone these fragments into the HindIII/KpnI-digested pEGFP-C1 expression vector. Similarly, the SM22 cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 51-201, 76-201, and 101-201 were generated by PCR and subcloned into the HindIII/KpnI-digested pEGFP-N1 expression vector. Expression Cloning Strategy—These assays were performed as described previously (37Wang H. Yang L. Jamaluddin Md. S. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22674-22683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, an arrayed human colon cDNA library (LCO-1001, Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD) in which cDNAs were constructed in the pCMV6-XL4 expression vector was employed. DH10B Escherichia coli bacteria were transformed with DNA from the library and seeded on ampicillin LB-agar plates to obtain ∼100 colonies per plate and cDNA pooled from each plate. In the primary screen cells in a 24-well format were co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with a DNA mixture comprised of the cDNA pool (700 ng), the MMP-9 promoter (2.2 kb)-luciferase reporter (100 ng), and 1 ng of an pRL-SV40 internal control. After 24 h, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). In secondary screens, positive pools were further subdivided with 10 colonies per plate. cDNA sub-pools were prepared and assayed as described above. Finally, in a tertiary screen, single colonies from positive sub-pools (selected in the secondary screen) were identified as described above. Immunostaining—Uterus was fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were then de-paraffinized, treated with 3% H2O2 in methanol, and then blocked with 5% normal horse serum and 1% normal goat serum. Sections were incubated overnight with a 1:500 rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse MMP-9 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) or an equivalent amount of an anti-rabbit IgG and subsequently with an anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated F(ab)2 fragment. The diaminobenzidine substrate was used to visualize immunoreactivity after counterstaining with hematoxylin. Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were carried out as described by us elsewhere (36Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using 10 μg of nuclear extract, 0.6 μg of poly(dI/dC), and 2 × 104 cpm of a [γ-32P]ATP T4 polynucleotide kinase-labeled oligonucleotide. Invasion Assays—These were as described by this laboratory previously (36Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cells (25,000) in 10% albumin (serum-free) were seeded on Matrigel-coated porous filter (8 μm) using 10% fetal bovine serum as chemoattractant. After 24 h, cells on the upper aspect of the membrane were removed by scrubbing and the cells on the lower aspect were counted. Reporter Assays—These were carried out as previously reported (36Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected (using Lipofectamine 2000) 24 h post-seeding with a promoter-driven luciferase reporter (0.1 μg) and, where indicated, an expression vector (pEGFP-C1) encoding the full-length or truncated SM22 fragments. A SV40 promoter (unless specified otherwise)-driven Renilla luciferase (4 ng) was included as internal control. Cells were washed 24 h later, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity. Semiquantitation of MMP-9 mRNA by RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells or mouse uterus using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (2 μg) and oligo(dt) primer (1 μg) were heated at 70 °C for 5 min, and chilled. To this was added 1× RT buffer (Promega), 0.5 mm each of four deoxynucleosides, 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega), 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate (Sigma), and 30 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The RNA was reverse transcribed at 42 °C, and 2 μl of the products were used as the template for multiplex PCR using MMP-9 and β-actin primers. The following primers used were were 5′-GAGGTTCGACGTGAAGGCGCAGATG-3′ and 5′-CATAGGTCACGTAGCCCACTTGGTC-3′ to amplify the human MMP-9 (product size, 120 bp) and β-actin (product size, 621 bp), 5′-ACACTGTGCCCATCTACGAGG-3′ and 5′-AGGGGCCGGACTCGTCATACT-3′. For mouse tissues, primers used were 5′-ATTGGTGAACAGCCTGTATCCT-3′ and 5′-CTCCACGGTAGTTTCCATCG-3′ to amplify a 251-bp product for the SM22 transcript. The primers for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-ACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG-3′ and 5′-CACATTGGGGGTAGGAACAC-3′ to amplify a 171-bp product. siRNA Targeting of SM22—Transfection efficiency using Lipofectamine 2000 was optimized using siTOX (Dharmacon RNA Technologies, catalog number D-001500-01-05). Cells were transfected with either siGenome SMARTpool reagent targeting SM22 (Dharmacon RNA Technologies, catalog number M-003714-01-0005) or siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon RNA Technologies, catalog number D-001210-01-05) at a concentration of 100 nm. The cells were incubated for 48 h post-transfection after which MMP-9 and SM22 expression was determined. Western Blotting—For ERK, MEK, p38, and JNK-1 immunoblotting, cells were serum starved overnight and then treated with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for various times. The cells were lysed in a buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, proteins (15-50 μg) were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% milk solution, blots were incubated with primary antibodies to phosphorylated JNK-1, p38 (Santa Cruz sc6254 and sc-7973, respectively), total ERKs (Cell Signaling catalog number 4696), and phosphorylated ERKs (Cell Signaling catalog number 9106) and total and phosphorylated MEKs 1 and 2 (Cell Signaling catalog numbers 9122 and 9121, respectively) at 4 °C overnight. Blots were washed with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) buffer, and then incubated with a horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized with ECL reagents. MMP-9 and SM22 protein were quantified essentially as described above but using polyclonal anti-MMP-9 (Biomol International, LP (catalog number SA-106)) and anti-SM22 antibodies, the latter as described elsewhere (38Fu Y. Liu H.W. Forsythe S.M. Kogut P. McConville J.F. Halayko A.J. Camoretti-Mercado B. Solway J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 1985-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Zymography—Zymography was carried out as described previously (36Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), using aliquots of conditioned medium corrected for any differences in cell number. Quantitation—Band intensity was quantified by densitometry using Quantity One Software (version 4.1) (Bio-Rad). Statistical Analysis—Differences were tested for statistical significance using an unpaired t test and GraphPad, Prism software (version 3.03). There has been no genome-wide search for regulators of MMP-9 expression and, to date, only a few regulators have been identified by empirical “guesswork.” Therefore to identify novel regulators of MMP-9 expression we employed a cDNA library comprised of 500,000 cDNAs. In this approach, the library was subdivided with primary screenings undertaken with pools of 100 cDNAs. For screening, we used HT1080 cells because it constitutively expresses moderate MMP-9 amounts allowing a search for both activators and repressors of MMP-9 expression. Identification of SM22 as a Putative Regulator of MMP-9 Expression—HT1080 cells were co-transfected with cDNA pools and a luciferase reporter regulated by 2.2 kb of MMP-9 upstream sequence and subsequently assayed for luciferase activity. This promoter sequence includes all the regulatory elements necessary for appropriate MMP-9 expression (39Yan C. Wang H. Aggarwal B.B. Boyd D.D. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 540-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Primary and secondary screens led to a subpool (13-1) of 10 cDNAs that diminished MMP-9 promoter activity (data not shown). This subpool was divided into individual clones and in a tertiary screen (Fig. 1A, open bar) clone 13-1(b) repressed MMP-9 promoter activity. DNA sequencing revealed that clone 13-1(b) corresponded to an open reading frame showing 98% homology with the full-length human transgelin (also known as SM22) cDNA coding sequence. MMP-9 promoter activity was decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B) with a 5:1 ratio of expression vector to the MMP-9 reporter reducing luciferase activity by over 60%. Whereas several putative regulators of MMP-9 expression were identified, we pursued SM22 as a candidate regulator for three reasons. First, there are few known repressors of MMP-9 expression. Second, data mining of expression profiling studies (Oncomine) revealed that SM22 expression is attenuated in some metastatic cancers (e.g. lung and prostate) characterized by their elevated MMP-9 mRNA/protein expression (40Garber M.E. Troyanskaya O.G. Schluens K. Petersen S. Thaesler Z. Pacyna-Gengelbach M. van de Rijn M. Rosen G.D. Perou C.M. Whyte R.I. Altman R.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Petersen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lamb C.C. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1395-1399PubMed Google Scholar). Third, little is known as to SM22 function. The transgelin gene (TAGLN) is located on chromosome 11q23.2 and generates a 1.3-kb mRNA. TAGLN expression is repressed by cell transformation (41Schenker T. Trueb B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The encoded 25- and 22-kDa protein products localize (44Shapland C. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Lawson D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) to the cytoplasm and cell membrane (45Camoretti-Mercado B. Forsythe S.M. LeBeau M.M. Espinosa R. Vieira J.E. Halayko A.J. Willadsen S. Kurtz B. Ober C. Evans G.A. Thweatt R. Shapiro S. Niu Q. Qin Y. Padrid P.A. Solway J. Genomics. 1998; 49: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SM22 binds actin via its carboxyl terminus residues (38Fu Y. Liu H.W. Forsythe S.M. Kogut P. McConville J.F. Halayko A.J. Camoretti-Mercado B. Solway J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 1985-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and has a putative role in actin gelation. Stable SM22 Expression Represses MMP-9 Expression—To validate the reporter assays, we determined the effect of SM22 on endogenous MMP-9 expression. HT1080 cells were stably transfected with an expression construct bearing the SM22 coding sequence, G418-resistant clones were expanded and analyzed for SM22 protein by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Three HT1080 clones (1Folgueras A.R. Pendas A.M. Sanchez L.M. Lopez-Otin C. Intl. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 4Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 6Hua J. Muschel R.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5279-5284PubMed Google Scholar) were positive for SM22 protein, whereas the parental cells and an empty vector control were negative for this protein. The various clones were then analyzed for MMP-9 activity by zymography (Fig. 2B). A gelatinolytic band identical in size (92 kDa) to MMP-9 was evident (Fig. 2B) in conditioned medium from both parental HT1080 and cells harboring the empty vector, whereas the intensity of the band was substantially diminished in the three SM22-expressing clones. In contrast, the 72-kDa gelatinolytic band, representing the product of the MMP-2 gene (46Collier I.E. Bruns G.A.P. Goldberg G.I. Gerhard D.S. Genomics. 1991; 9: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was unchanged by SM22 expression. To corroborate these data, MMP-9 mRNA levels were semi quantified by multiplex RT-PCR. Again, whereas an amplified product of the predicted size (120 base pairs) was easily detected with the parental and empty vector-transfected HT1080 cells (Fig. 2C), the intensity of the signal was clearly attenuated in the three separate SM22-expressing HT1080 clones (1Folgueras A.R. Pendas A.M. Sanchez L.M. Lopez-Otin C. Intl. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 4Vu T.H. Werb Z.

To further confirm its role as a suppressor of MMP-9 expression, HT1080 cells bearing the empty vector or clones expressing SM22 were analyzed for in vitro invasion. Expectedly (47Sato T. Koike L.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1025-1029PubMed Google Scholar), HT1080 cells expressing the empty vector were highly invasive through an extracellular matrix-coated porous filter (Fig. 3A), whereas two independent clones expressing the SM22 cDNA showed about a 50% reduction in this assay. Diminished invasiveness was effectively rescued by the addition of exogenous MMP-9 protein suggesting that the attenuated behavior was largely because of repressed MMP-9 expression. The reduced invasiveness of the SM22-expressing clones was not a consequence of diminished proliferation (data not shown). Thus, HT1080 cells stably overexpressing SM22 show attenuated MMP-9 expression.FIGURE 3Reduced in vitro invasion of SM22-transfected HT1080 cells. The indicated clones (25,000) were seeded on Matrigel-coated porous filters with or without exogenous (33 ng/ml) MMP-9 protein. After 18 h, cells were removed from the top aspect of the filter. The filter was stained with Diff-Quik and cells on the lower aspect of the filter enumerated.

https://openalex.org/W1991755293,"Regulation of platelet activation plays a central role in hemostasis and pathophysiological processes such as coronary artery disease. Thrombin is the most potent activator of platelets. Human platelets express two thrombin receptors, PAR1 and PAR4, both of which signal platelet activation. Evidence is lacking on the mechanism by which PAR1 and PAR4 may differentially signal platelet aggregation. Here we show that at the relatively high concentration of agonist most likely found at the site of a local thrombus, dual inhibition of the P2Y12 receptor and calcium mobilization result in a complete inhibition of PAR4-induced aggregation, while having no effect on either thrombin or PAR1-mediated platelet aggregation. Both PAR1- and PAR4mediated aggregation are independent of calcium mobilization. Furthermore, we show that P2Y12 receptor activation is not required for protease-activated receptor-mediated aggregation at higher agonist concentrations and is only partially required for Rap1 as well as GPIIbIIIa activation. P2Y12 receptor inhibitors clinically in use such as clopidogrel are postulated to decrease platelet aggregation through partial inhibition of PAR1 signaling. Our data, however, indicate that at high local concentrations of thrombin, it is the signaling through PAR4 rather than PAR1 that may be regulated through purinergic feedback. Thus, our data identify an intra-platelet mechanism that may function as a future site for therapeutic intervention.

These studies have led to the discovery of a family of G protein-coupled receptors that are activated via protease cleavage of the receptor revealing a new tethered ligand and are appropriately termed the protease-activated receptor (PAR) 2The abbreviations used are: PAR, protease-activated receptor; BAPTAAM, 1,2-Bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester; 2-MeSAMP, 2-methylthioadenosine monophosphate; Ab, antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting.2The abbreviations used are: PAR, protease-activated receptor; BAPTAAM, 1,2-Bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester; 2-MeSAMP, 2-methylthioadenosine monophosphate; Ab, antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. family (9Vu T.K.

Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S. Farese Jr., R.V. Tam C. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Research in the field has indicated that PAR1 is a high affinity thrombin receptor that signals through at least three classes of G proteins (Gα12,Gαq, and Gαi/o) (11Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 12Macfarlane S.R. Seatter M.J. Kanke T. Hunter G.D. Plevin R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 245-282PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PAR4 has been shown to signal through at least two G protein signaling pathways (Gα12 and Gαq but not to Gαi/o) (13Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J.

Mouse models have been essential for identifying important steps in platelet signaling downstream of thrombin such as receptor activation of PAR3 and PAR4 (10Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V.

J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Because mouse platelets do not express PAR1, the PAR-mediated signaling pathways may not be identical in human models to that postulated for the mouse. For this reason, it is important to gain an understanding of how thrombin regulates PAR-mediated signaling in the human platelet. PAR activation of platelets results in the secretory release of a number of small molecule and protein modulators of platelet function, including ATP and ADP (17Reed G.L. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2004; 30: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Once released, ADP further stimulates the platelet in an autocrine fashion through purinergic receptors on the platelet surface (18Dorsam R.T. Kunapuli S.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In the mouse model, purinergic stimulation is crucial to platelet activation, whereas human platelets appear to be able to bypass this pathway. It has also been shown that a synergistic link may exist between one of the purinergic receptors, P2Y12, and PAR signaling (19Dorsam R.T. Tuluc M. Kunapuli S.P. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although the convergence of the P2Y12 and PAR4 pathways has yet to be fully elucidated. Furthermore, because PAR1 has been shown to be activated before PAR4 (20Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), PAR1 may be activated at low levels of circulating thrombin, whereas PAR4 may become active following the initial clot formation when the local thrombin concentration is significantly increased (7Brass L.F. Chest. 2003; 124: S18-S25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Based on published data (10Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S. Farese Jr., R.V. Tam C. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 20Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), it is plausible to postulate that PAR1 and PAR4 signal through a different complement of G proteins in the human platelet (21Graff J. Klinkhardt U. Harder S. Thromb. Res. 2004; 113: 295-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our findings identify for the first time a discrete signaling difference between PAR1 and PAR4 in human platelets. Understanding these signaling differences may provide insight into targets that lend themselves to the development of better anti-platelet therapies having less pronounced bleeding liabilities than current therapeutic approaches (22Maroo A. Lincoff A.M. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2004; 30: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Ali A. Hashem M. Rosman H.S. Moser L. Rehan A. Davis T. Romanelli M. LaLonde T. Yamasaki H.

Human Platelets—Human platelets were obtained from healthy volunteers from within the Vanderbilt University community. These studies were approved by the Vanderbilt University institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all individuals prior to platelet donation. Materials—Human α-thrombin (2700 NIH units/mg) was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Activating peptides for PAR1 (PAR1-AP; SFLLRN) and PAR4 (PAR4-AP; AYPGKF) were purchased from GL Biochem (Shanghai, China). Purified human fibrinogen, 2-methylthioadenosine monophosphate (2-MeSAMP), and ADP were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Rap1 Ab was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Blocking buffer and anti-rabbit IRDYE 800 were purchased from LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE). Anti-PAC1-FITC Ab was purchased from Pharmingen. Aggregometry cuvettes and stir bars were purchased from ChronoLog Corp. (Havertown, PA). BAPTA-AM was purchased from Calbiochem. MRS-2179 was purchased from Tocris Pharmaceuticals (Ellisville, MO). Fura2-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes. U-73122 and U-73343 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Platelet Aggregation—Platelet aggregations were measured using washed platelets. Briefly, blood was centrifuged in a Forma 400-ml GP centrifuge at 170 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The platelet-rich plasma was placed into 15-ml conical tubes containing a 10% acid citrate dextrose solution (39 mm citric acid, 75 mm sodium citrate, and 135 mm glucose; pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The pelleted platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (12 mm NaHCO3, 127 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES) and adjusted to a concentration of 3 × 108 platelets/ml using a Coulter counter. Some platelets were treated with 20 μm BAPTA-AM for 10 min, 4 μm U-73122 or U-73343 for 5 min, 50 μm 2-MeSAMP for 5 min, or 100 μm MRS-2179 for 5 min. Following stimulation with either 10 nm thrombin, 20 μm PAR1-AP, or 200 μm PAR4-AP, the change in light transmission was monitored with an aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp.). Measurement of RAP1 Activity—Rap1 activity was measured using GST-RalGDS-Rap1-binding domain (RalGDS-RBD) that specifically pulls down activated Rap1 (24Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 25van Triest M. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The RalGDS-RBD was coupled at 4 °C for 1.5 h with 0.3 ml of glutathione Sepharose 4B, washed twice with lysis buffer, and aliquoted into 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes. Following stimulation, platelets were lysed with 2× lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2% IGEPAL, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), centrifuged, and incubated with RalGDS-RBD for 1 h at 4 °C. After several washes, precipitated Rap1 was boiled in Laemmli buffer for 10 min and run on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the anti-Rap1 Ab. To control for protein loading, total platelet lysates were loaded and immunoblotted to confirm equal protein loading for each sample. Some platelets were pretreated with BAPTA-AM, 2-MeSAMP, or both BAPTA-AM and 2-MeSAMP. Following pretreatment, cells were stimulated for 5 min with thrombin, PAR1-AP, or PAR4-AP and analyzed for Rap1 activation. GPIIbIIIa Activation—Human platelet GPIIbIIIa activation was assessed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (26Shattil S.J. Cunningham M. Hoxie J.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 307-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were pretreated with BAPTA-AM, Me2SO, 2-MeSAMP, or both BAPTA-AM and 2-MeSAMP followed by activation with PAR1-AP or PAR4-AP. Platelets were then incubated for 15 min with a FITC-conjugated PAC1 Ab that only recognizes the active form of GPIIbIIIa followed by flow cytometric measurement of active surface expression of GPIIbIIIa. Calcium Mobilization—Washed platelets were incubated with Fura-2-AM (2.5 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. Following incubation, 10% acid citrate dextrose was added to the suspended platelets, and they were centrifuged 2 times for 10 min at 800 × g at room temperature and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer. Some platelets were pretreated with BAPTA-AM or U-73122. Thrombin, PAR1-AP, or PAR4-AP was added immediately prior to fluorescent analysis using a Varian Eclipse fluorometer. Statistical Analysis—Comparison between experimental groups was made using a paired t test program using Prism software. Differences in mean values were considered significant at p < 0.05. PAR-specific Affinity for Platelet Aggregation—PAR1 and PAR4 have been reported to have significantly different EC50 values for platelet aggregation. This parameter is dependent on many factors, including platelet preparation (platelet-rich plasma versus washed) and types of inhibitors used (i.e. aspirin or apyrase) to pretreat the platelets prior to stimulation. The dose-response curves for both PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP are shown in Fig. 1. Washed human platelets were suspended in Tyrode's buffer in the absence of inhibitors such as aspirin, apyrase, or P2Y receptor inhibitors. The EC50 for PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP under these conditions was 3 and 80 μm, respectively. Based on these curves, PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP were used in all subsequent experiments at a concentration of 20 and 200 μm, respectively, in order to ascertain the effect of inhibiting several different signaling pathways on the ability of PAR1/PAR4 to initiate platelet aggregation. PAR-induced Calcium Effects on Platelet Aggregation—The role calcium plays in PAR-mediated regulation of human platelets is not well defined. To determine whether chelation of Ca2+ by BAPTA was able to fully inhibit intra-platelet calcium mobilization, free calcium was measured following stimulation with thrombin, PAR1-AP, or PAR4-AP with or without pretreatment with 20 μm BAPTA (Fig. 2, A and B). A transient increase in calcium mobilization was observed following treatment with all three PAR agonists. To determine whether calcium plays a necessary role in PAR-mediated platelet aggregation, calcium was chelated with BAPTA-AM, and intra-platelet calcium was monitored fluorometrically with Fura2-AM (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). Following pretreatment, calcium mobilization was completely inhibited. Under conditions where calcium mobilization was fully attenuated, platelet aggregation was minimally affected (Fig. 4). To determine whether the PAR-induced calcium mobilization was downstream of phospholipase C activation, phospholipase C was blocked with U-73122 (but not its inactive isomer U-73343), and similar results were obtained (supplemental Fig. 1).FIGURE 4Dual inhibition blocks PAR4-mediated platelet aggregation. A, platelets were pretreated with 50 μm 2-MeSAMP, 20 μm BAPTA-AM, or both 2-MeSAMP and BAPTA-AM followed by stimulation with 10 nm thrombin (A), 20 μm PAR1-AP (B), or 200 μm PAR4-AP (C). D, percent aggregation with thrombin (n = 9), PAR1-AP (n = 10), or PAR4-AP (n = 8) after pretreatment with the 2-MeSAMP, BAPTA-AM, or the combination of 2-MeSAMP + BAPTA-AM (***; p < 0.0001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Purinergic Regulation of Platelet Aggregation—It has been well documented that purinergic agonists such as ADP are able to induce platelet aggregation. Furthermore, platelet activation in the mouse is thought to involve both the PAR and purinergic receptor signaling pathways. Therefore, we wanted to determine which purinergic receptor, P2Y1 (thought to specifically signal through Gαq) or P2Y12 (thought to specifically signal through the Gαi/o family), might be involved in PAR-induced human platelet aggregation. Platelets pretreated with MRS-2179 (P2Y1 receptor antagonist), 2-MeSAMP (P2Y12 receptor antagonist), or both were stimulated with 40 μm ADP, and the resulting platelet aggregation was measured (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of the P2Y1 receptor was unable to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation (but did induce a delay in the rate of aggregation calculated as the percentage of aggregation/s in the control and MRS-2179-treated conditions, 0.862 ± 0.12 and 0.314 ± 0.17, respectively). Inhibiting the P2Y12 receptor resulted in a 90% inhibition of platelet aggregation, and inhibiting both receptors resulted in a complete block of platelet aggregation in response to ADP. To confirm that neither P2Y1 activation nor its signaling through Gαq is a requisite component of PAR-mediated platelet aggregation, platelets were pretreated with MRS-2179 with or without BAPTA-AM followed by stimulation with either PAR1-AP or PAR4-AP. Neither PAR1-AP- nor PAR4-AP-mediated platelet aggregation was affected by inhibition of the P2Y1 receptor indicating that P2Y12 and not P2Y1 activation may be required for PAR-mediated platelet aggregation (Fig. 3, B and C). Dual Inhibition of PAR-mediated Platelet Activation—Identification of signaling differences between PARs may require simultaneous inhibition of multiple pathways as has been eluded to in mouse platelets (19Dorsam R.T. Tuluc M. Kunapuli S.P. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Adam F. Verbeuren T.J. Fauchere J.L. Guillin M.C. Jandrot-Perrus M. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 798-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, platelets were pretreated with 2-MeSAMP, BAPTA, or 2-Me-SAMP + BAPTA. Aggregation was then measured following stimulation with thrombin, 20 μm PAR1-AP, or 200 μm PAR4-AP (Fig. 4). There was no observable decrease in maximum platelet aggregation observed with BAPTA pretreatment. However, a delay in the rate of aggregation was observed following pretreatment with BAPTA (calculated as percentage aggregation/s in the control and BAPTA-AM treated conditions, respectively) in the thrombin (1.4 ± 0.11; 0.93 ± 0.11), PAR1-AP (1.71 ± 0.15; 1.28 ± 0.09), and PAR4-AP (1.72 ± 0.14; 0.7 ± 0.16) conditions. Thrombin and PAR1-AP-stimulated platelet aggregation was not inhibited by any of the combinations of inhibitors (Fig. 4, A, B, and D). PAR4-AP-stimulated platelet aggregation, although not being greatly affected by inhibition of either calcium mobilization or P2Y12 signaling, was completely blocked by dual inhibition with 2-MeSAMP and BAPTA and was significantly attenuated following pretreatment with 2-MeSAMP (Fig. 4, C and D). Similarly, pretreatment with U-73122 alone had little effect on either PAR1AP- or PAR4AP-induced maximal platelet aggregation. However, pretreatment with both U-73122 and 2-MeSAMP resulted in an 80% inhibition of PAR4AP-induced platelet aggregation, whereas PAR1AP-induced aggregation was not significantly affected. Because the ability of low concentrations of agonists to induce aggregation may be attenuated through inhibition of specific signaling pathways (because of partial activation of the surface receptors), we looked at the ability of increasing concentrations of agonist to either PAR1 or PAR4 to overcome these inhibitory effects (Figs. 5 and 6). BAPTA and 2-MeSAMP appeared to attenuate the level of aggregation at lower concentrations of agonist. However, Fig. 5 indicates that treatment with PAR1-AP overcame the inhibitory effect of dual inhibition at higher concentrations of agonist (when the PARs are fully activated), whereas Fig. 6 indicates that PAR4-AP was unable to induce aggregation even at very high levels of agonist (7.5-fold EC50 and 10-fold EC50 for PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP, respectively) even though PAR4-AP was able to induce full platelet aggregation under BAPTA or P2Y12 conditions at the highest agonist concentrations tested, indicating the existence of differential signaling pathways between these two receptors.FIGURE 6PAR4 dose-response curves to dual inhibitory effect of BAPTA and 2-MeSAMP. Representative dose-response curves for PAR4-AP-induced aggregation at different concentrations of PAR4-AP (50-800 μm) with or without 20 μm BAPTA, 50 μm 2-MeSAMP, or both (n = 3).

To ascertain what role calcium or P2Y12 activation plays in PAR-induced Rap1 activation in human platelets, GTP-bound Rap1 was measured in platelets pretreated with inhibitors to these pathways (supplemental Fig. 2). 2-MeSAMP partially blocked PAR-induced Rap1 activation, whereas calcium inhibition had no apparent effect on PAR-mediated Rap1 activation. Role of Fibrinogen in PAR-mediated Platelet Aggregation—As all of the experiments use washed platelets (to maintain a similar treatment of platelets for all experiments in the study), it is possible that the differences observed in inhibition may be due to the fact that the majority of fibrinogen has been removed prior to the experiment. To test for this possibility, platelets were pretreated with or without 2-MeSAMP + BAPTA-AM. Following pretreatment, the platelets were supplemented with or without 100 μg/ml fibrinogen and stimulated with thrombin, PAR1-AP, or PAR4-AP (Fig. 7, A and B). There was no observable difference in aggregation between platelets supplemented with or without fibrinogen. PAR-mediated Activation of GPIIbIIIa—Glycoprotein IIbIIIa is the integrin receptor thought to play a crucial role in platelet aggregation (30Boekholdt S.M. Peters R.J. de Maat M.P. Zwinderman A.H. van Der Wallqq E.E. Reitsma P.H. Jukema J.W. Kastelein J.J. Am. Heart. J. 2004; 147: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Fuster V. Badimon L. Badimon J.J. Chesebro J.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). To determine what role GPIIbIIIa plays in PAR-mediated platelet aggregation, platelets were pretreated with BAPTA-AM, Me2SO (as the vehicle control), 2-MeSAMP, or BAPTA-AM and 2-MeSAMP. Following pretreatment, platelets were stimulated with PAR1-AP (Fig. 8, A-C) or PAR4-AP (Fig. 8, D-F). Surface activation of GPIIbIIIa was measured through FACS analysis with the aid of a FITC-tagged antibody that only recognizes active GPIIbIIIa (PAC1). BAPTA-AM pretreatment had no effect on PAR-mediated GPIIbIIIa activation (Fig. 8, A and D). Pretreatment with 2-MeSAMP caused a substantial decrease in the number of active GPIIbIIIa molecules following both PAR1-AP as well as PAR4-AP stimulation (Fig. 8, B and E). Similarly, dual inhibition with BAPTA-AM and 2-MeSAMP showed a decrease in the number of active GPIIbIIIa molecules following stimulation (Fig. 8, C and F). The relative decrease in GPIIbIIIa activation was similar between PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP stimulation (Fig. 8G). These data are similar to the findings that Rap1 activation is partially, but not completely, inhibited by 2-MeSAMP, whereas BAPTA-AM has relatively no effect on either Rap1 or GPIIbIIIa activation (supplemental Fig. 2). This study focused on how PAR4 differs from PAR1 in the way it signals platelet aggregation. We observed that at high levels PAR4-AP-mediated aggregation, which mostly likely occurs at the site of a local thrombus, was severely attenuated following the dual inhibition of calcium mobilization and P2Y12 receptor signaling, whereas at high concentrations of thrombin and PAR1-AP signaling was unaffected. Furthermore, we showed that calcium mobilization was not required in order for thrombin, PAR1-AP, or PAR4-AP to induce Rap1 activation, GPIIbIIIa activation, or platelet aggregation. Interestingly, although Rap1 and GPI-IbIIIa are thought to play important roles in platelet activation, we indicate here that other as yet undetermined components must play a critical role in PAR-mediated aggregation as well as Rap1 and GPIIbIIIa activation because none of the conditions tested were able to completely block either of these important signaling components. Hence, this report provides evidence that physiological effects observed downstream of PAR1 and PAR4 are most likely not because of redundant signaling pathways. Increases in intra-platelet calcium mobilization were observed following thrombin, PAR1, and PAR4 stimulation (Fig. 2). Calcium is thought to play a role in Rap1 activation, secretion, and possibly aggregation; however, its requirement for these processes has not been thoroughly investigated in human platelets. Differences in the reported requirement for calcium mobilization downstream of PAR activation (24Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 29Woulfe D. Jiang H. Mortensen R. Yang J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) may be based on the receptor being studied as well as the concentration of agonist used in these studies. Our results indicate that because PARs signal to multiple G proteins, calcium is not required for PAR-mediated aggregation in human platelets. Agonist concentration also plays a role in platelet aggregation as local concentrations of thrombin at the site of vascular injury may be quite high. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of thrombin and PARs at high concentrations (as described in Fig. 1) to better understand PAR signaling at the site of a thrombus. Figs. 5 and 6 demonstrate that although both PAR1-AP- and PAR4-AP-induced aggregation are severely attenuated at sub-maximal concentrations of each agonist, at high concentrations (above the EC100:EC50 for PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP was 3 and 80 μm, respectively) PAR1-AP but not PAR4-AP was able to overcome this inhibition. This is in line with the general observation that at higher concentrations some agonists are able to recruit additional G protein signaling pathways. The results support the notion that calcium-dependent signaling is not required for Rap1 activation (supplemental data), and subsequent platelet aggregation as these PAR-mediated effects may involve several complex signaling pathways downstream of PAR1 and PAR4 (21Graff J. Klinkhardt U. Harder S. Thromb. Res. 2004; 113: 295-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Work on PAR4 signaling within the mouse model indicates that PAR4 may signal synergistically with P2Y12 in order to induce platelet activation (32Woulfe D. Jiang H. Morgans A. Monks R. Birnbaum M. Brass L.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33van der Meijden P.E. Feijge M.A. Giesen P.L. Huijberts M. van Raak L.P. Heemskerk J.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been well documented that ADP may play a role in PAR-induced effects on both the human as well as mouse model for platelet activation (19Dorsam R.T. Tuluc M. Kunapuli S.P. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Graff J. Klinkhardt U. Harder S. Thromb. Res. 2004; 113: 295-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Data presented here not only concur with this hypothesis (Fig. 4) but additionally indicate that not all PARs require this synergy, because at higher concentrations PAR1- but not PAR4-induced platelet aggregation shows little attenuation under any of the conditions studied. These findings support the hypothesis that Gαi/o, which has only been shown to couple to PAR1 and not to PAR4, may play an important role in signaling platelet aggregation, and that calcium mobilization together with Gαi/o (through P2Y12 or PAR1) activation is necessary for aggregation to occur. Blocking either calcium mobilization or P2Y12 activation had no effect on PAR4 (indicating that neither PAR4- nor P2Y12-mediated calcium activation is required for PAR4-mediated platelet activation), whereas blocking both of these signaling pathways completely inhibited the ability of PAR4-AP (even at 10-fold EC50 for PAR4-AP as indicated in Fig. 6, whereas PAR1-AP fully responds to the dual inhibition at 6-fold its EC50 as indicated in Fig. 5), but not thrombin or PAR1-AP, to induce platelet aggregation. It is difficult to directly assess the involvement of Gαi/o as a signaling partner in platelets because there is no mechanism by which pertussis toxin can move to the intra-platelet surface to inhibit Gαi/o activation. Some published work in the field indicating that PAR1 does not signal through Gαi/o relies on the indirect downstream measurement of cAMP levels to determine Gαi/o activation (34Kim S. Foster C. Lecchi A. Quinton T.M. Prosser D.M. Jin J. Cattaneo M. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It has been well established that inhibition of cAMP is not the only pathway in which Gi/o signals its effects. For example, Gαo can regulate Rap1 through Rap1GAP activity (35Schultess J. Danielewski O. Smolenski A.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 36Bertoni A. Tadokoro S. Eto K. Pampori N. Parise L.V. White G.C. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the βγ subunits of Gi/o have been shown to induce multiple downstream signaling pathways that are independent of cAMP levels (37Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 38Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Hence, we suggest that the critical Gαi/o component may arise through PAR1 stimulation directly at higher levels of PAR1-AP, but in PAR4 signals through secretory feedback and activation of P2Y12 (a receptor which specifically signals through Gαi/o). Under no conditions tested was Rap1 or GPIIbIIIa activation completely blocked, indicating that although P2Y12 activation plays an important upstream regulatory role for Rap1 activation (29Woulfe D. Jiang H. Mortensen R. Yang J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), other PAR-mediated signaling pathways must regulate Rap1 activation independent of P2Y12 (16Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M.

A recent finding that Rap1 regulates cross-talk between several integrins and is regulated itself by these receptors further illustrates the complexity involved in Rap1 signaling in platelets (41Bernardi B. Guidetti G.F. Campus F. Crittenden J.R. Graybiel A.M. Balduini C. Torti M. Blood. 2006; 107: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our findings give strong evidence that there is a limited correlation between GPIIbIIIa activity and platelet aggregation because partial inhibition of GPIIbIIIa following 2-MeSAMP resulted in a minimal attenuation of platelet aggregation. PAR1 has a higher affinity for thrombin than PAR4 and thus is most likely the first PAR activated when thrombin is formed (10Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S. Farese Jr., R.V. Tam C. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 42Xu W.F. Andersen H. Whitmore T.E. Presnell S.R. Yee D.P. Ching A. Gilbert T. Davie E.W. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Because PAR4 signaling is prolonged (43Murugappan S. Shankar H. Bhamidipati S. Dorsam R.T. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2005; 106: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it is thought to play a role in the late phase of the platelet aggregation (8Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 20Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), establishing a differential physiological function for the two receptors and indicating a potentially crucial role for PAR4 signaling in mediating irreversible platelet activation resulting in subsequent occlusion of the vessel. Furthermore, PAR1, but not PAR4, has been shown to couple to the Gαi/o family of G proteins (11Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 13Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J. Shapiro M.J. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our findings provide direct evidence that PAR1 and PAR4 signaling differ not only in their efficacy to thrombin but also in their individual signaling networks. With this in mind, it is plausible to hypothesize that PAR1 activation at low concentrations of thrombin is necessary to form the initial platelet clot following vascular injury. The lower PAR4 affinity for thrombin may indicate that PAR4 is activated within the local environment of the initial platelet plug and plays a role in the late (irreversible) phase of platelet activation. If this is the case, modulation of PAR4 activity may play an essential role in regulating the probability of vessel occlusion following a vascular injury. P2Y12 receptor antagonists (clopidogrel and ticlopidine) are currently in clinical use. The CAPRIE study indicated that clopidogrel in particular significantly decreased the incidence of vascular occlusive diseases associated with platelet activation, such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke (44Tendera M. Wojakowski W. Thromb. Res. 2003; 110: 355-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 45CAPRIE Steering Committee Lancet. 1996; 348: 1329-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6024) Google Scholar), as well as reocclusion following percutaneous coronary intervention (46Yusuf S.

Furthermore, other studies indicate that clopidogrel was more effective than treatment with aspirin alone (44Tendera M. Wojakowski W. Thromb. Res. 2003; 110: 355-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 45CAPRIE Steering Committee Lancet. 1996; 348: 1329-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6024) Google Scholar, 46Yusuf S.

Wilmer C. Topol E.J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 288: 2411-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar). However, under all of the conditions tested in these clinical studies, thrombin maintained the ability to signal platelet aggregation indicating that complex signaling mediated through multiple signaling pathways is involved. Our data indicate that the multiple receptor activation observed following thrombin is not redundant. Furthermore, our findings elucidate which signaling pathways may be critical for platelet activation. We showed that signaling through the P2Y12 but not P2Y1 receptor plays at least a partial role in PAR4-mediated signaling, whereas no observable dependence on P2Y12 was measured following stimulation with maximal concentrations of PAR1-AP (20 μm). Therefore, inhibition of signaling by ADP through P2Y12 may function to affect platelet aggregation by attenuating the PAR4 signaling pathway (33van der Meijden P.E. Feijge M.A. Giesen P.L. Huijberts M. van Raak L.P. Heemskerk J.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) while having little effect on PAR1-mediated thrombin signaling. If this is the case, a specific inhibitor of PAR4 signaling may result in a more desirable side effect profile as compared with clopidogrel. Future studies will be aimed at elucidating at what point in the signaling pathway calcium converges downstream of PAR4 with the P2Y12 signaling pathway as this may identify a better potential site for therapeutic intervention. We have proposed a model of how thrombin induces human platelet activation through its receptors (Fig. 9). In this model, thrombin fully activates both PAR1 and PAR4 following vascular injury. PAR1 (signaling through Gα12, Gαq, and Gαi/o) and PAR4 (signaling through Gα12 and Gαq) both induce secretion of the α-granules and dense granules, Rap1, and GPIIbIIIa activation, as well as platelet aggregation. PAR1 does not directly or indirectly require P2Y12 receptor activation because PAR1 directly activates Gαi/o. PAR4 signaling, however, converges downstream with P2Y12 signaling to mediate platelet aggregation. Although our data, as well as others', indicate that P2Y12 receptor activation is important for Rap1 activation, inhibition of the P2Y12 receptor does not fully eliminate PAR-mediated Rap1 activation indicating another mechanism for partial activation of Rap1 and GPIIbIIIa. These findings are the first to identify how PAR1 signaling differs from that of PAR4 (8Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 10Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S. Farese Jr., R.V. Tam C. Coughlin S.R.

Furthermore, PAR4-mediated intra-platelet calcium mobilization plays a role in ADP activation of purinergic receptors and is thought to be partially regulated by PAR1 (20Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These data, combined with our current findings, identify a potential physiological link between the complex activity observed in platelet activation (1Rosenberg R.D. Aird W.C. N. Engl. J.

In brief, ∼1 × 106 cells per microgram of DNA were electroporated and incubated overnight with medium supplemented with 10 mm sodium butyrate. Cells were harvested and assayed the following day.

Flow Cytometry—Approximately 5 × 105 cells were harvested, washed once with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (0.25% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline) and then incubated with the primary antibody or the corresponding IgG isotype control for 15 min in a final volume of 100 μl. Cells were then washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer and incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibody for 15 min in a final volume of 50 μl. Subsequently, cells were washed with fluorescence-activated cell-sorting buffer and resuspended in a final volume of 400 μl before being analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (20Auger G.A. Pease J.E. Shen X. Xanthou G. Barker M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The anti-CCR1 antibody was used at 10 μg/ml, the anti-hemagglutinin antibody was used at 5 μg/ml, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was used at a 1:50 dilution. All incubations were carried out on ice. Chemotaxis Assay—Assays of chemotactic responsiveness were performed using ChemoTx™ plates (Receptor Technologies Ltd., Oxon, UK) as described previously (19Martinelli R. Sabroe I. LaRosa G. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42957-42964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, different concentrations of CCL3 in the presence or absence of a fixed concentration of BX 471 were loaded onto the bottom wells in a final volume of 31 μl of chemotaxis media (HEPES-modified RPMI 1640 media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The 5-μm pore filter was placed on top of the wells, and 2 × 105 cells in a volume of 20 μl of chemotaxis media were loaded onto the filter. Following incubation for 5 h in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the numbers of cells migrating into the well were counted using a hemocytometer. In a primary screen, the ability of BX 471 to inhibit 10 nm CCL3-induced cell migration in all of the point mutants was assessed at least three times in triplicate. Mutants of interest were further characterized over a greater concentration range of CCL3. In every experiment, cells transiently expressing the wild-type CCR1 construct were employed as a positive control. 125I-BX 691 Binding Studies—Binding assays were performed utilizing scintillation proximity assay (SPA) technology as previously described (9Liang M. Mallari C. Rosser M. Ng H.P. May K. Monahan S. Bauman J.G. Islam I. Ghannam A. Buckman B. Shaw K. Wei G.P. Xu W. Zhao Z. Ho E. Shen J. Oanh H. Subramanyam B. Vergona R. Taub D. Dunning L. Harvey S.

HEK293 cells expressing human CCR1 at 20,000 cells or human monocytes at 125,000 cells per assay point were used as the receptor source. Cells were incubated with 0.1 nm of 125I-BX 691 and 0.05-0.1 mg of WGAPVT-SPA beads at room temperature for 1 h. The receptor-bound 125I-BX 691 excited the scintillant embedded in the beads and triggered a signal that could be detected by scintillation counter (Wallac microbeta). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 nm unlabeled BX 691. 125I-CCL3 Binding Studies of CCR1 Mutants—Whole cell binding assays on transiently transfected L1.2 cells were performed as described previously (21Hesselgesser J. Ng H.P. Liang M. Zheng W. May K. Bauman J.G. Monahan S. Islam I. Wei G.P. Ghannam A. Taub D.D. Rosser M. Snider R.M. Morrissey M.M. Perez H.D. Horuk R. J. Biol.

In all experiments, each data point was assayed in triplicate. Data are presented as the percentage of counts obtained in the absence of cold competing ligand. The binding data were curve fitted with the computer program IGOR (Wavemetrics) to determine the affinity and number of sites. MembStruk Structure Prediction Method—The Memb-Struk3.5 procedure described previously was used to predict the structure of CCR1 (17Kalani M.Y. Vaidehi N. Hall S.E. Trabanino R.J. Freddolino P.L. Kalani M.A. Floriano W.B. Kam V.W. Goddard III, W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3815-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The transmembrane regions and the hydrophobic maxima (shown below in bold font and underlined) were predicted using the TM2ndS method with multiple sequence alignment that includes all chemokine receptor sequences. The predicted TM regions were: TM1, QLLPPLYSLVFVIGLVGNILVVLVLVQYK; TM2, SIYLLNLAISDLLFLFTLPFWIDYKLK; TM3, AMCKILSGFYYTGLYSEIFFIILLTIDRYLAIVH; TM4, TFGVITSIIIWALAILASMPGLYF; TM5, ALKLNLFGLVLPLLVMIICYTGII; TM6, RLIFVIMIIFFLFWTPYNLTILISVFQDF; and TM7, TEVIAYTHCCVNPVIYAFVGER. Subsequent optimization of the relative translation, rotational orientation, and the kinks and bends of the transmembrane helices were performed as described previously (15Trabanino R.J. Hall S.E. Vaidehi N. Floriano W.B. Kam V.W. Goddard 3rd., W.A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1904-1921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alternate well packed low energy rotational orientations were also generated as described previously (22Trabanino R.J. Prediction of Structure, Function, and Spectroscopic Properties of G-protein-coupled Receptors: Methods and Applications. California Institute of Technology, 2004Google Scholar). The rotational angle scanning for helix7 was performed by protonating His-293 due to the proximity of Glu-120 on helix3. Extra- and intracellular loops were added using Modeler6v2, and the second extracellular loop was optimized as described previously (22Trabanino R.J. Prediction of Structure, Function, and Spectroscopic Properties of G-protein-coupled Receptors: Methods and Applications. California Institute of Technology, 2004Google Scholar). The resulting structure has the following interhelical hydrogen bonds. Asp-80(TM2) makes a 2.9-Å hydrogen bond with Asn-297(TM7). Asn-52(TM1) makes a 2.1-Å hydrogen bond with Asp-80(TM2). These hydrogen bonds are between the most conserved residues in the class A rhodopsin-like GPCRs. There is also a 2.9-Å hydrogen bond between Asn-297(TM7) and Glu-120(TM3). Glu-120(TM3) also makes a hydrogen bond with His-293 on helix 7. There is a weak or perhaps a water-mediated hydrogen bond between Asn-75(TM2) and Trp-158(TM4) and between Ser-79(TM2) and Ser-119(TM3). Prediction of the Binding Site for BX 471—The void space in the entire receptor structure was divided into 14 regions of 7 × 7 × 7Å3 volume, and HierDock calculations were performed (3Vaidehi N. Floriano W.B. Trabanino R. Hall S.E. Freddolino P. Choi E.J. Zamanakos G. Goddard III, W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12622-12627Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) to determine the binding site of BX 471. Using quantum mechanical calculations, the pKa of BX 471 was calculated to be neutral at normal pH. BX 471 was subsequently docked into this binding region using the HierDock procedure with protein-movable optimization (3Vaidehi N. Floriano W.B. Trabanino R. Hall S.E. Freddolino P. Choi E.J. Zamanakos G. Goddard III, W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12622-12627Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Subsequent to docking the binding energies were calculated as, BE = PE (ligand in fixed protein) - PE (ligand in solvation), where BE is the binding energy, PE (ligand in fixed protein) is the potential energy of the ligand calculated with the protein atoms fixed, and PE (ligand in solvation) is the potential energy of the ligand calculated with the analytical volume-generalized Born continuum solvation method. The docked structure with the best binding energy was selected for analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. Virtual Screen—Using GOLD 2.1 (23Evers A. Klabunde T. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 1088-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we docked all compounds of a filtered version of the Maybridge data base spiked with 35 known CCR1 antagonists from our in-house optimization project and kept the top 50 conformations for each compound. The docked configurations were scored by the sum of the van der Waals and Coulomb protein-ligand interaction energies, using Dock 4.0.1 (24Floriano W.B. Vaidehi N. Zamanakos G. Goddard III, W.A. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The top scoring 50% of compounds were further optimized in a 50-conjugate gradient step minimization, using the Universal 1.0.2 force field as implemented in Cerius2. The five lowest energy structures are further minimized for 250 steps. Note that all minimizations are performed in fixed protein. Finally, we calculate the desolvation penalty for the best configuration of each compound using the generalized Born solvation method as implemented in-house (25Still W.C. Tempczyk A. Hawley R.C. Hendrickson T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 6127-6129Crossref Scopus (3363) Google Scholar). Our final score is the sum of Coulomb, van der Waals, and desolvation energies. The predicted structure for CCR1 is shown in Fig. 1, along with the binding site of BX 471 that is located between TMs 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The strongest protein-ligand interactions in the predicted structure are predominantly of hydrophobic character. They arise from Tyr-113(TM3) and Ile-259(TM6), which anchor the piperazine ring, and Tyr-114(TM3), which provides pi-stacking interactions to the adjacent phenyl ring with the urea group (red residues in Fig. 1, B and C). Neither tyrosine forms strong hydrogen bonds to BX 471. The fluorine on BX 471 interacts favorably with one of the methyl groups of Leu-87 and with the phenyl ring of Phe-83. The urea group of BX 471 does not make tight polar interactions with the protein, although it can hydrogen-bond to the carbonyl group of the Gly-168 backbone or the OH-group of Tyr-114. The structure activity relationship from our medicinal chemistry optimization program for this particular substituent indicates that it is not an important site for protein-ligand interactions, because many different substituents of different sizes and polarities are tolerated in this position. Molecular dynamics simulations of the CCR1/BX 471 complex in explicit lipid bilayer and water indicate that this group is highly flexible and forms hydrogen bonds with water molecules that enter the binding region. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that the CCR1 structure with BX 471 bound is stable over the entire 10 ns of simulation time. Because the prediction of the loop structures is associated with a large degree of uncertainty, we ignored the contribution of residues in the loop to binding. To verify the predicted binding site of BX 471, we constructed a series of 17 receptor mutants (Fig. 2). These mutants included key residues predicted to be in the binding pocket for BX 471 (Tyr-113, Tyr-114, and Ile-259) together with residues Tyr-41, Glu-287, and Tyr-291, identified as playing a role in antagonist binding in previous studies with charged CCR1 antagonists (18de Mendonca F.L. da Fonseca P.C.

Cells separately transfected with either wild-type CCR1 or with point mutants of CCR1 predicted to be outside the antagonist binding site were included as controls (Fig. 2). The point mutants were all transiently expressed at high levels on the surface of L1.2 cells as detected by flow cytometry after incubation with an antibody to an epitope tag at the receptor amino terminus (Fig. 2A). The CCR1 point mutants were then screened for antagonism by BX 471 of chemotactic responses to 10 nm CCL3 (Fig. 2B). Several mutants, including Y41A, Y113A, Y114A, I259A, and Y291A were very resistant to inhibition by BX 471, and full dose-response curves for these and other selected mutants were carried out. The functional assays revealed that BX 471 has an IC50 greater than 10 μm for inhibition of chemotaxis in the Y113A, Y114A, and I259A mutants (Fig. 3A and Table 1), as expected from the model. Other mutants, including Y41A and Y291A, were also resistant to inhibition of chemotaxis by BX 471 (Fig. 3A and Table 1), consistent with the predictions.FIGURE 3BX 471 inhibition of CCL3-mediated chemotaxis and radiolabeled CCL3 binding to L1.2 cells transiently expressing selected CCR1 point mutants.

Competition binding assays revealed that the mutations Y113A and Y114A on TM3 and I259A on TM6 resulted in a significant reduction in binding of BX 471, in line with the data from the chemotaxis assays. Specifically, whereas the antagonist binds to the wild-type receptor with an IC50 of 10 nm, the IC50 for the Y113A and I259A mutants is >10 μm, and for Y114A it is >5 μm. The large effects of these three mutations on BX 471 binding had been predicted in the computational mutation studies that showed a change in binding energy of 6.28, 5.79, and 9.24 kcal/mol, respectively, for these three mutants (Table 1). The large decrease in binding energy predicted for Y113A, Y114A, and I259A arises predominantly from the loss of favorable van der Waals interactions of the phenyl containing residues with the piperazine ring in BX 471. Indeed, the calculations followed by experiments show that replacement of Tyr-113 by phenylalanine (Y113F) has a minimal effect on the ability of BX 471 to inhibit binding or chemotaxis, compared with a total inability of the antagonist to inhibit either process in the Y113A mutant (see Fig. 3 and Table 1). Interestingly the residues Tyr-41, Glu-287, and Tyr-291, which were identified to bind to the protonated antagonist UCB35625 (18de Mendonca F.L. da Fonseca P.C. Phillips R.M. Saldanha J.W. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4808-4816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and Glu-287, which has also been implicated in the binding of another protonated antagonist, BX 510 (26Onuffer J. McCarrick M.A. Dunning L. Liang M. Rosser M. Wei G.P. Ng H. Horuk R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), are not part of the binding pocket for BX 471 even though we do observe changes in experimental binding and activation studies with these mutants. Y41A(TM1) makes a strong (2.85 Å) interhelical hydrogen bond to Glu-287(TM7), which is well preserved during the molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water and lipid with antagonist bound. Tyr-291(TM7) is one turn below Glu-287(TM7) and has a loose aromatic stacking interaction with Tyr-41(TM1). We speculate that this network of hydrogen bonding between Tyr-41 and Glu-287 combined with aromatic stacking between Tyr-41 and Tyr-291 is important for structural stability, and therefore mutation of any of these residues affects both binding and activation of CCR1. In contrast, these residues play only a minor role in binding the neutral antagonist BX 471, where Tyr-113, Tyr-114, and Ile-259 play the most important role. Thus, the binding site of the neutral antagonist BX 471 is shifted toward helices 3, 6, and 7 compared with the binding site of protonated antagonists that lies closer to helices 1 and 2. A major assumption in receptor mutagenesis studies is that any loss of function observed is due to the mutation alone and does not involve structural changes in the molecule. Such an assumption is generally valid for surface residues but is not necessarily true for buried/structural large hydrophobic or aromatic residues. Because the residues we have identified as important for binding in this study, Tyr-113, Tyr-114, and Ile-259, are buried hydrophobic or aromatic residues, it was important to determine that the mutations did not perturb the structure and function of the receptor. To test the structural integrity of the three CCR1 mutants Y113A, Y114A, and I259A we carried out both displacement binding and chemotaxis studies with the CCR1 ligand CCL3. The binding studies revealed (Fig. 4B) that all three mutants had very similar affinities for binding of CCL3 (WT Ki = 31.8 ± 16.1 nm; Y113A Ki = 22.3 ± 3.1 nm; Y114A Ki = 15.3 ± 3.3 nm; I259A Ki = 14.7 ± 4.9 nm). In addition all three mutants responded chemotactically in a similar dose-responsive manner as wild-type CCR1 to increasing concentrations of CCL3 (Fig. 4A). These data strongly suggest that the structural integrity of these mutants with respect to chemokine binding and activation is not altered. We cannot rule out, however, that structural changes have occurred in these mutants that would not be manifested by changes in chemokine function. We do think that this is unlikely, however, for several reasons. First, we see robust expression of the CCR1 mutants compared with wild-type CCR1, and misfolded proteins would tend to exhibit lower expression. Second, in the apo-protein structure of CCR1 (after 10 ns of molecular dynamics simulation in explicit lipid bilayer and water), Tyr-113(TM3) has favorable van der Waals interactions with Ile-259(TM6) and hydrogen bond interaction with Thr-286(TM7). Tyr-114 on TM3 has weak van der Waals interactions with Val-263(TM6) and Tyr-113(TM3). Ile-259 makes van der Waals contact with Leu-208(TM4) and Val-263(TM6). In the Y113A mutant, the loss of hydrogen bond interaction with Thr-286 is partially compensated for by the favorable interaction of the methyl group of Ala-113 with the methyl group of Thr-286(TM7). We speculate that this hydrogen bond is not a critical structural factor, because mutating Tyr-113 → Ala or Tyr-113 → Phe did not affect the cell surface expression levels of these mutants. Y114A and I259A mutants similarly have weaker van der Waals interactions that may not impair the folding of the receptor. Based on these observations along with the robust level of cell surface expression seen for these mutant receptors, we speculate that mutation of these residues to Ala does not affect the structural integrity of the receptor. This validates our contention that they play a key role in ligand binding of the antagonist BX 471. The chemokine receptor antagonist BX 471 is highly specific for CCR1. Previous work has shown that it has no cross-reactivity at concentrations >10 μm with 30 other GPCRs, including several chemokine receptors (9Liang M. Mallari C. Rosser M. Ng H.P. May K. Monahan S. Bauman J.G. Islam I. Ghannam A. Buckman B. Shaw K. Wei G.P. Xu W. Zhao Z. Ho E. Shen J. Oanh H. Subramanyam B. Vergona R. Taub D. Dunning L. Harvey S. Snider R.M. Hesselgesser J. Morrissey M.M. Perez H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19000-19008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The only exception is the low affinity binding to CCR3 with a Ki of 1.4 μm. CCR3 has 63% sequence identity to CCR1, and the residues Tyr-113, Ile-259, Ile-91, and Tyr-291 are conserved between the two receptors. Based on our model we speculate that the basis for the low affinity binding of BX 471 to CCR3 is partly due to the conservation of residues Tyr-113 and Ile-259 in CCR3 that have been shown to be important in the binding of BX 471 to CCR1. To further characterize the CCR1 antagonist binding site we utilized a 125I-labeled CCR1 antagonist generated by replacing the chloro-group on the benzyl ring of BX 471 with an iodogroup. The resulting compound BX 691 is a functional antagonist for CCR1 with similar potency (Ki 1.7 nm). Because BX 471 and BX 691 behave similarly as CCR1 antagonists, 125I-BX 691 was used to characterize the direct interaction of small molecule CCR1 antagonists with CCR1. 125I-BX 691 binds to CCR1 on human monocytes as well as on HEK293 cells that express the receptor (Fig. 5). The binding is dose-responsively inhibited by unlabeled BX 471 and BX 691, with affinities similar to those for displacing 125I-CCL3 binding (Fig. 5). However, the CCR1 agonists CCL3, CCL5, and CCL7 failed to displace 125I-BX 691 binding to CCR1, suggesting that they do not bind to the same site on the receptor as the antagonists. These data clearly suggest that BX 471 and BX 691 are allosteric antagonists of CCR1 and bind to sites on the receptor that are non-overlapping and distinct from the agonist binding site. Indeed, structure-function studies have revealed that chemokines such as CCL3 bind to CCR1 via residues in the N terminus and in the extracellular loops (27Pease J.E. Wang J. Ponath P.D. Murphy P.M.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have shown here that BX 471, like other chemokine receptor antagonists (29Mirzadegan T. Diehl F. Ebi B. Bhakta S. Polsky I. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Weatherhead G.S. Lapierre J.M. Dankwardt J. Morgans Jr., D. Wilhelm R. Jarnagin K. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 5639-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), binds to CCR1 in the transmembrane domain, similar to the transmembrane binding domain of 11-cis-retinal in rhodopsin. Through its interaction with residues in the transmembrane domain, BX 471 induces a conformational change in the receptor that leads to displacement of bound chemokine from its extracellular binding site. In contrast, when radiolabeled BX 471 is bound, CCR1 agonists are unable to competitively displace the antagonist. To further validate the predicted structure and binding site, we docked several antagonists, belonging to the same piperazine template as BX 471, to CCR1 (Table 2). The model clearly distinguishes strong from weak binders according to their calculated binding energies. Thus, we believe that structure-based design using GPCR models can be used in future projects during the medicinal chemistry optimization phase of lead compounds.TABLE 2Correlation between the calculated change in binding energies (BE) and experimental binding affinities for human CCR1 docked with CCR1 antagonists Lastly, we performed a retrospective virtual ligand screen using the predicted structure and binding site of BX 471 to explore if the model could be used in the lead identification process. To this end, we docked a filtered version of the Maybridge data base (∼51,000 compounds) enriched with 35 known CCR1 antagonists ranging in affinity between 1 and 1000 nm, which represent four different chemical templates (some representative structures are shown in Table 2) into the predicted structure without loops. We used a hierarchical virtual ligand screen procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of the virtual screen showed that 43% of all CCR1 actives were recovered in the top 2% of screened molecules and 63% of the known CCR1 antagonists scored within the top 5% of the screened molecules (Fig. 6). This corresponds to a hit enrichment of 21 times over random at 2% and 13 times over random at 5% of the data base screened, where enrichment factors have been calculated as in a previous study (11Shacham S. Marantz Y. Bar-Haim S. Kalid O. Warshaviak D. Avisar N. Inbal B. Heifetz A. Fichman M. Topf M. Naor Z. Noiman S. Becker O.M. Proteins. 2004; 57: 51-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that predicted GPCR structures are useful in a structure-based in silico drug discovery process and underscore the ability of the CCR1 model to retrieve seeded CCR1 antagonists from multiple templates with high efficiency from a chemical data base. This is important, because it validates the model in addition to the validation provided by the experimentally determined binding and activation data described earlier. The next logical step in this process will be to utilize the model in a prospective virtual screen to identify new CCR1 actives from commercially available chemical databases. Hopefully this will aid and abet the drug discovery process by finding new lead compounds to supplement traditional approaches that utilize high throughput screening of compound libraries. In conclusion, we predicted a structure of the human chemokine receptor CCR1 using the MembStruk computational method. Additionally, we predicted the binding site of the neutral antagonist BX 471 in CCR1 using the HierDock computational method. The structure suggested that the residues Tyr-113, Tyr-114, and Ile-259 are the most important for binding of the antagonist BX 471 to CCR1. We then validated the predicted antagonist binding site in CCR1 using mutational analysis. Further, we used the protein structure to successfully identify CCR1 antagonists in a retrospective virtual ligand screen of a large data base, demonstrating the utility of structure-based in silico methods in the hit-finding process of GPCR antagonists. Our results suggest that structure-based in silico rational drug design for GPCR targets is feasible."

Joining of the fragments by DNA ligase I to generate the continuous double-stranded DNA requires complete removal of the RNA/DNA primer. Pol δ extends the upstream Okazaki fragment and displaces the downstream RNA/DNA primer into a flap removed by nuclease cleavage. One proposed pathway for flap removal involves pol δ displacement of long flaps, coating of those flaps by replication protein A (RPA), and sequential cleavage of the flap by Dna2 nuclease followed by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1). A second pathway involves reiterative single nucleotide or short oligonucleotide displacement by pol δ and cleavage by FEN1. We measured the length of FEN1 cleavage products on flaps strand-displaced by pol δ in an oligonucleotide system reconstituted with Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins. Results showed that in the presence of PCNA and FEN1, pol δ displacement synthesis favors formation and cleavage of primarily short flaps, up to eight nucleotides in length; still, a portion of flaps grows to 20–30 nucleotides. The proportion of long flaps can be altered by mutations in the relevant proteins, sequence changes in the DNA, and reaction conditions. These results suggest that FEN1 is sufficient to remove a majority of Okazaki fragment primers. However, some flaps become long and require the two-nuclease pathway. It appears that both pathways, operating in parallel, are required for processing of all flaps.

Eukaryotic DNA replication proceeds discontinuously via Okazaki fragment synthesis and maturation on the lagging strand.

The primer is extended by a complex of DNA polymerase δ (pol δ), the sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and the clamp loader replication factor C (RFC). Pol δ continues extension of the upstream fragment until it runs into the downstream fragment, displacing its 5′-end region into a flap. The flap can be cleaved by a nuclease to form a nick, which will be sealed by DNA ligase I to generate the continuous double-stranded DNA (1Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev.

Through Okazaki fragment processing reconstitution studies in vitro, Ayyagari et al. (3Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1618-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) showed that short flaps, 10 nt in length, are processed efficiently by FEN1 to generate ligatable replication intermediates. More recent experimentation revealed that in the presence of pol δ and FEN1, strand-displacement and cleavage generated mainly mononucleotide products (5Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In contrast, strand-displacement by mutant forms of pol δ, deficient in its proofreading 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, and cleavage by FEN1 generated monothrough hexanucleotide products (5Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of pol δ, coordinated with FEN1, prevents extensive strand-displacement because pol δ 3′-5′ exonuclease mutants exhibit greater strand-displacement activity than wild-type pol δ (4Jin Y.H. Ayyagari R. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1626-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the synthetic lethal interaction between 3′-5′ exonuclease mutants of pol δ (pol3-exo) and either rad27 deletion mutants or those that are compromised for interaction with its cofactor PCNA (rad27-p) (10Kokoska R.J.

Altogether, these results suggest that with wild-type proteins, the system is generally designed to strand-displace and cleave short flaps, while failure to cleave at the short stage, either because strand-displacement is enhanced or nuclease cleavage inhibited, leads to the possibility that long flaps occasionally form (3Ayyagari R.

(13Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) asserts that flaps greater than 27 nt in length are coated by the single-stranded-binding protein replication protein A (RPA). RPA inhibits cleavage by FEN1 but stimulates cleavage by Dna2 nuclease/helicase (13Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Dna2, like FEN1, must track from the 5′-end of the flap to cleave (15Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38022-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Kao H.I. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50840-50849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because Dna2 is unable to cleave at the base of a flap (14Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it will cleave within the single-stranded region of the flap generating a short flap, too small to be coated by RPA (13Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The short flap can then be cleaved by FEN1 to generate the nick for ligation (13Bae S.H. Bae K.H.

Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Dna2 cleavage products appear before FEN1 cleavage products, supporting their hypothesis of the sequential action of Dna2 and then FEN1 to remove the primer. Additional evidence of a role for both Dna2 and FEN1 in Okazaki fragment maturation includes physical and genetic interactions between the two proteins. Dna2 and FEN1 have been shown to interact by immunoprecipitation (17Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Also, studies of mutants in S. cerevisiae revealed a synthetic lethal interaction between dna2-1 and rad27 and a partial rescue of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of dna2-1 mutants when Rad27 is overexpressed (17Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 18Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of rad27 deletion strains is rescued by overexpression of Dna2 (17Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Finally, the lethality of recombination-defective pol3-exo rad27-p double mutant strains is also suppressed by Dna2 overexpression (4Jin Y.H. Ayyagari R. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1626-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because of the biochemical and genetic connection between FEN1 and Dna2, we investigated whether properties of the reconstituted system suggest a role for the proposed pathway involving Dna2 nuclease. Even if only a small fraction of flaps escape FEN1 cleavage to become long, the actual number could be significant in vivo because there are millions of Okazaki fragments processed in mammalian cells. Therefore, the proportions of short and long products become an important factor to consider in understanding primer removal. To address the question of whether the action of FEN1 alone is sufficient to remove the Okazaki fragment primer, we reconstituted Okazaki fragment processing in vitro, with proteins from S. cerevisiae. We asked which is the predominant pathway for primer removal, concentrating on various factors that might affect the proportions of short and long products. Materials—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by either Midland Certified Reagents Company (Midland, TX) or Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Polynucleotide kinase, the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, and streptavidin were purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN).

The flow-through from the Mono S column was collected and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was eluted with a gradient of HI buffer (30 mm HEPES and 0.5% inositol) with 30–2000 mm KCl. Oligonucleotide Substrates—Using oligonucleotide primers, substrates were designed to simulate Okazaki fragment processing intermediates. The primer sequences are listed in Table 1. Primers U1 and D1-D3 were 5′-labeled by polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Primers D1-D3 were 3′-labeled by annealing a 20-nt labeling template with a 5′-GCTA overhang to the 3′-end of the primer and incorporating a labeled dC using [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow polymerase. After electrophoresis on a 15%/7 m urea polyacrylamide gel, labeled primers were isolated and purified. Substrates used to observe pol δ synthesis were annealed in a 1:2:4 ratio of labeled upstream primer to template to downstream primer. Substrates used to observe FEN1 cleavage were annealed in a 1:2:4 ratio of labeled downstream primer to template to upstream primer. Annealing was performed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. All substrates were annealed by combining the primers in annealing buffer, heating the mixture at 95 °C for 5 min, transferring to 70 °C, and cooling to room temperature.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequencesPrimerLengthSequencentUpstream (5′-3′)U120GTCCACCCGACGCCACCTCCDownstream (5′-3′)D160AGACGAATTCCGGATACGACGGCCAGTGCCGACCGTGCCAGCCTAAATTTCAATCCACCCD260GCGGTCGGAGCTGATACTACGTCAAGTGCTGACAGTGTCAGCCTAAATTTCAATCCACCCD3aUnderline indicates RNA segment.60AGACGAAUUCCGGATACGACGGCCAGTGCCGACCGTGCCAGCCTAAATTTCAATCCACCCTemplatebBoth templates T1 and T2 are biotinylated at both the 5′- and 3′ -ends.

Open table in a new tab There are two primary sets of substrates used for the following experiments. All substrates contain a 20-nt upstream primer and a 60-nt downstream primer annealed to the 3′- and 5′-ends, respectively, of a 110-nt template. However, the two sets differ in the nucleotide content of the downstream region. One set contains a nucleotide sequence balanced in AT/GC content in the downstream region and will be referred to as the standard substrate. The second set of substrates contains a GC-rich region at the 5′-end of the downstream primer and will be referred to as the GC-rich substrate. The specific substrate used in any experiment will be indicated in the figure legend and depicted above the figure. Enzyme Assays—Biotinylated substrates (5 fmol per reaction) were preincubated with streptavidin (500 fmol each reaction) on ice for 20 min prior to initiating the reaction. In a total reaction volume of 20 μl, substrate was then incubated with 22.7 fmol pol δ-wt or pol δ 3-01 (indicated in figure legend), 50 fmol of PCNA, 50 fmol of RFC, and 20 fmol of FEN1 (or titration amount indicated in figure legends) for 10 min at 30 °C. Reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 50 μm dNTPs, and 75 mm NaCl (unless otherwise indicated). Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μl 2× termination dye (90% formamide (v/v), 10 mm EDTA with 0.01% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol) and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Reaction products were loaded onto a 15%/7 m urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis. The gel was scanned by a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and results analyzed with Image Quant version 1.2 software. For the time course reactions examining FEN1 cleavage on 3′-labeled substrates, a volume of 120 μl of master reaction mix containing 30 fmol of biotinylated substrate (preincubated with 3000 fmol of streptavidin on ice for 20 min), 136 fmol of pol δ-wt or pol δ 3-01 (indicated in figure legend), 300 fmol of PCNA, 300 fmol of RFC, and 120 fmol of FEN1 in reaction buffer (described above) was incubated at 30 °C. At each time point (0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min), 20 μl of the master reaction mix was removed and added to a tube containing 10 μl of 2× termination dye. Reactions were heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Reaction products were loaded onto a 15%/7 m urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis. The gel was scanned by a PhosphorImager and results analyzed with Image Quant. Cleavage Product Distribution Analysis—First, bands were identified on the gels and correlated with flap cleavage lengths. Then, using Image Quant software, the gel lanes were scanned and peaks of signal intensities were detected. Bands on the gels corresponding to different flap cleavage lengths were matched with the peaks detected by Image Quant. The intensity of peaks from the FEN1 alone cleavage was subtracted from the intensity of peaks in the presence of pol δ, PCNA/RFC, and FEN1. A graph of flap length versus peak intensity was generated, and a moving average trendline (period of 3) was added to smooth and indicate the trend of the data. Our goal was to test whether long flaps (greater than about 8 nt) are generated in an Okazaki fragment processing reconstitution following strand-displacement by pol δ. The presence of long flaps would suggest that in addition to being subject to FEN1 cleavage, some could be long enough to become substrates for Dna2. First, we examined pol δ strand-displacement and FEN1 flap cleavage with wild-type enzymes. Then, we determined how mutations that impair pol δ or FEN1 influence the length of flaps and their cleavage. Long Flaps Are Created and Cleaved by FEN1 Following Displacement by Both pol δ-wt and pol δ 3-01—This first experiment used either pol δ-wt or pol δ 3-01, deficient in 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, in reconstitutions with the standard substrate, which has nearly equal AT/GC content at the 5′-end of the downstream primer. This substrate, like all the substrates used in the following experiments, resembles a lagging strand synthesis intermediate with an upstream and downstream primer annealed to the 3′- and 5′-ends, respectively, of an oligonucleotide template such that there is a gap between the two primers. Substrates are depicted above the figures. When investigating synthesis by pol δ, the substrate is radiolabeled at the 5′-end of the upstream primer, allowing observation of extension by the polymerase. Full-length extension of the 20-nt upstream primer results in a product 110-nt in length, as indicated in all figures displaying synthesis products. In the presence of PCNA/RFC and FEN1, both the pol δ-wt and pol δ 3-01 displayed some level of full-length synthesis (Fig. 1A, lane 5 and lane 9, respectively). The same was also true for the GC-rich substrate (Fig. 1B, lane 5 and lane 9, respectively). This evidence of strand-displacement indicates that flaps for cleavage by FEN1 were generated. Initial FEN1 cleavage products were evaluated by using a substrate radiolabeled at the 5′-end of the downstream primer, to allow visualization of the first product cleaved from each downstream primer. The maximum length FEN1 cleavage product for a reconstitution with pol δ-wt was about 30 nt versus about 41 nt with pol δ 3-01 (Fig. 1A, lanes 14 and 16, respectively). The length of flap released correlated with the extent of strand-displacement. Greater strand-displacement resulted in longer flap displacement and consequently longer flap cleavage products. Displacement synthesis by pol δ 3-01 in this system generates longer cleavage products than pol δ-wt on the standard substrates. In addition to the cleavage products dependent on pol δ strand-displacement synthesis, there is a large amount of cleavage exhibited by FEN1 in the absence of polymerase (Fig. 1A, lane 11). This non-synthesis-dependent FEN1 activity is high with the standard substrate and creates an undesirable background in the reactions with displacement synthesis. To suppress this background, a substrate was designed that is GC-rich at the 5′-end of the downstream primer. Because GC residues base pair more strongly than AT residues, we predicted that the GC-rich sequence would stabilize the annealed 5′-end of the downstream primer. This stabilization limited the amount of non-synthesis-dependent FEN1 cleavage (Fig. 1A, lane 11 versus Fig. 1B, lane 11, respectively). In the presence of pol δ-wt, FEN1 cleaved flaps up to about 14-nt long (Fig. 1B, lane 14), while in the presence of the pol δ 3-01, flaps up to 27-nt long were cleaved (Fig. 1B, lane 16). The overall length of pol δ-displaced and FEN1-cleaved flaps decreased on the GC-rich substrate. However, for both the standard and GC-rich substrates, pol δ 3-01 displacement generates longer cleavage products than the pol δ-wt (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 16 versus lane 14). This result is consistent with previous biochemical results demonstrating that the exonuclease deficient pol δ 3-01 generates longer strand-displacement products than the wild-type polymerase (4Jin Y.H. Ayyagari R. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1626-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Salt Decreases Non-synthesis-dependent FEN1 Cleavage While Still Allowing for Strand-displacement Synthesis—The studies presented in Fig. 1 were carried out at low salt buffer conditions (0 mm NaCl as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Increasing salt stabilizes duplex DNA. It also inhibits FEN1 interaction with DNA, particularly when PCNA is not present (8Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 24Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). As a result, both the initiation of strand-displacement synthesis by pol δ, and non-synthesis-dependent FEN1 cleavage should be inhibited when increasing amounts of salt are added into the reconstitution. Increasing the salt concentration slightly decreased both the amount of substrate usage by the polymerase and overall amount of synthesis with both the standard (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–6 and 7–11) and GC-rich substrates (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–6 and 7–11). Yet, higher salt still allowed complete strand-displacement synthesis to occur on both the standard and GC-rich substrates (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 2–11), although notable pausing by the polymerase was observed upon encountering the 5′-end of the downstream primer, a position corresponding to the nick. Significantly, higher salt markedly decreased the amount of non-synthesis dependent FEN1 cleavage (Fig. 2A, lanes 14–17 compared with lane 13). This trend is similar for both the standard (Fig. 2A) and the GC-rich substrates (Fig. 2B, lanes 14–17 compared with lane 13). The remaining experiments were done at 75 mm NaCl, which effectively limits the amount non-synthesis-dependent FEN1 cleavage without significantly affecting polymerase activity. Endonuclease-deficient FEN1 Generates a Larger Proportion of Long Cleavage Products Compared with Wild-type FEN1—The effects of a mutant FEN1 on flap formation were investigated. The G67S FEN1, which was identified in a screen for replication and repair mutants having a tendency toward insertion or deletion of nucleotides within a repeat tract, has a point mutation in the proposed catalytic site. As observed through assays in vitro, the G67S mutant is deficient in double and single flap endonucleolytic cleavage and exonucleolytic cleavage. The maximum amount of cleavage on a single-flap substrate with the wild-type FEN1 was 90% versus 60% with the G67S FEN1. Although deficient in cleavage, the mutant nuclease still retains a measurable level of cleavage activity (22Xie Y. Liu Y. Argueso J.L. Henricksen L.A. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Alani E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4889-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We compared wild-type FEN1 to the G67S mutant in reconstitution assays with either pol δ-wt or pol δ 3-01 and PCNA/RFC on both the standard and GC-rich substrates. With either pol δ-wt (data not shown) or pol δ 3-01 (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 5–8 and 10–13), the total amount of primer usage and synthesis was similar on both the standard and GC-rich substrates in the presence of both wild-type and G67S FEN1. Moreover, the mutant and wild-type FEN1 support comparable amounts of full-length extension by pol δ 3-01 (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 5–8 and 10–13). On the standard substrate, with pol δ-wt and PCNA/RFC, cleavage products were seen up to 27-nt long with both the wild-type and mutant FEN1 (data not shown). However, the G67S FEN1 generated a larger proportion of long cleavage products relative to short products when compared with the wild-type FEN1 (data not shown). For the purposes of describing cleavage product proportions, we defined short products as those 1–8 nt in length and long products ranging from 9–59 nt. With the GC-rich substrate, we were unable to detect cleavage products longer than 5 nt in the presence of pol δ-wt (data not shown). In contrast, products up to about 50-nt long were observed with both substrates in assays with pol δ 3-01 (Fig. 3, A and B). On the standard substrate the ratio of long products to short products is 0.33 with the wild-type FEN1 (Fig. 3A, lane 21) compared with 1.4 wi"

They are kinesin-associated proteins proposed to function as adaptors in the anterograde trafficking of organelles to synapses. Here we have studied in more detail the interaction between the prototypic kinesin heavy chain, KIF5C, kinesin light chain, and GRIF-1. The GRIF-1 binding site of KIF5C was mapped using truncation constructs in yeast two-hybrid interaction assays, co-immunoprecipitations, and co-localization studies following expression in mammalian cells. Using these approaches, it was shown that GRIF-1 and the KIF5C binding domain of GRIF-1, GRIF-1-(124-283), associated with the KIF5C non-motor domain. Refined studies using yeast two-hybrid interactions and co-immunoprecipitations showed that GRIF-1 and GRIF-1-(124-283) associated with the cargo binding region within the KIF5C non-motor domain. Substantiation that the GRIF-1-KIF5C interaction was direct was shown by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses using fluorescently tagged GRIF-1 and KIF5C constructs. A significant fluorescence resonance energy transfer value was found between the C-terminal EYFP-tagged KIF5C and ECFP-GRIF-1, the C-terminal EYFP-tagged KIF5C non-motor domain and ECFP-GRIF-1, but not between the N-terminal EYFP-tagged KIF5C nor the EYFP-KIF5C motor domain and ECFP-GRIF-1, thus confirming direct association between the two proteins at the KIF5C C-terminal and GRIF-1 N-terminal regions. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal imaging strategies further showed that GRIF-1 can bind to the tetrameric kinesin light-chain/kinesin heavy-chain complex. These findings support a role for GRIF-1 as a kinesin adaptor molecule requisite for the anterograde delivery of defined cargoes such as mitochondria and/or vesicles incorporating β2 subunit-containing GABAA receptors, in the brain. γ-Aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptor interacting factor-1 (GRIF-1) and N-acetylglucosamine transferase interacting protein (OIP) 106 are both members of a newly identified coiled-coil family of proteins.

It was shown to associate at least in vitro with GABAA receptor β2 subunits. GRIF-1 is highly expressed in excitable tissue, most notably in the brain and in the heart (1Beck M. Brickley K.

It is the orthologue of the human protein, β-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) interacting protein 98 (OIP98, also termed ALS2CR3, huMilt2, or TRAK2), and it is the homologue of the protein OIP106 (also termed huMilt1 and TRAK1 (2Iyer S.P.N. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)). GRIF-1 is also probably the orthologue of the Drosophila protein, Milton, a kinesin-associated protein that is involved in the transport of mitochondria to the synapses in retina (3Stowers R.S. Megeath L.J. Gorska-Andrzejak J. Meinertzhagen I.A. Schwarz T.L. Neuron. 2002; 36: 1063-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 4Gorska-Andrzejak J. Stowers R.S. Borycz J. Kostyleva R. Schwarz T.L. Meinertzhagen I.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 463: 372-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). GRIF-1 and OIP106 have also been shown to aggregate mitochondria following overexpression in mammalian cells (5Brickley K. Smith M.J. Beck M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14723-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, the gene encoding OIP106 (TRAK1), Trak1, was identified as the mutated gene in hyrt mice, an animal model of hypertonia (6Gilbert S.L. Zhang L. Forster M.L. Anderson J.R. Iwase T. Soliven B. Donahue L.R. Sweet H.O. Bronson R.T. Davisson M.T. Wollman R.L. Lahn B.T. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). hyrt mice were shown to have a deficit of GABAA receptors; wild-type OIP106 (TRAK1) was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with GABAA receptor α1 subunits in extracts of mouse brain stem and spinal cord (6Gilbert S.L. Zhang L. Forster M.L. Anderson J.R. Iwase T. Soliven B. Donahue L.R. Sweet H.O. Bronson R.T. Davisson M.T. Wollman R.L. Lahn B.T. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the mutant OIP106 was shown to still associate with GABAA receptors, it was concluded that OIP106 (TRAK1) may play a crucial role in regulating endocytic trafficking of receptors and dysfunction disrupts receptor homeostasis leading to hypertonia (6Gilbert S.L. Zhang L. Forster M.L. Anderson J.R. Iwase T. Soliven B. Donahue L.R. Sweet H.O. Bronson R.T. Davisson M.T. Wollman R.L. Lahn B.T. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, GRIF-1, OIP106, and Milton belong to a newly identified family of coiled-coil proteins putatively involved in the trafficking of organelles and GABAA receptors to synapses. Two additional proteins that associate with high affinity with both GRIF-1 and OIP106 have been identified. These proteins are the enzyme, OGT (2Iyer S.P.N. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), 5K. Pozo, K. Brickley, M. Beck, and F. A. Stephenson, unpublished observations. and, consistent with the role in trafficking, the molecular motor protein, kinesin (5Brickley K. Smith M.J. Beck M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14723-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Kinesin was also shown to be immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of Drosophila heads with anti-Milton antibodies, thereby demonstrating, albeit reportedly indirect, an association between Milton and kinesin (3Stowers R.S. Megeath L.J. Gorska-Andrzejak J. Meinertzhagen I.A. Schwarz T.L. Neuron. 2002; 36: 1063-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Kinesins belong to the kinesin superfamily, i.e. KIFs. KIFs are microtubule-based mechanochemical motors that are involved primarily in the anterograde transport of organelles and protein complexes (reviewed in Refs. 7Hirokawa N. Takemura R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar and 8Miki H. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 467-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). They are particularly important in transport processes in neurons where it is necessary to deliver defined cargoes from the cell body along axons and dendrites to pre- and post-synaptic sites. In brain, GRIF-1 associates predominantly with KIF5A, whereas in heart association is predominantly with KIF5B (5Brickley K. Smith M.J. Beck M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14723-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Following overexpression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, GRIF-1 will co-associate with exogenous KIF5C (5Brickley K. Smith M.J. Beck M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14723-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). KIF5A, KIF5B, and KIF5C are members of the kinesin-1 family. KIF5B is ubiquitously expressed, whereas KIF5A and KIF5C are only expressed in neurons (7Hirokawa N. Takemura R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). They are conventional kinesin heavy chains belonging to the kinesin-1 family, and they share at least 60% amino acid identity. It is probable that each has a binding site for GRIF-1 and that GRIF-1 is promiscuous with regard to association with KIF5 subtypes. Kinesin-1 proteins are tetramers formed by the association of two kinesin heavy chains (KHC or alternatively KIF5) and two kinesin light chains (KLC). The KHC is formed from an N-terminal motor domain that contains the microtubule and ATP binding sites and a C-terminal non-motor domain. This domain includes a neck, a coiled-coil stalk region, and a cargo binding site in its C-terminal region. The KLC interacts with the KHC via the stalk region. Cargoes bind to either the KLC or to the KHC of kinesin-1 proteins. Increasing evidence suggests that this interaction is mediated by an adaptor protein. For example, mitochondria and syntaxin-1-containing vesicles are attached to the KHC cargo binding domain by the adaptor protein, syntabulin, for their transport to synapses (9Su Q. Cai Q. Gerwin C. Smith C.L. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar); JIP-3, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway protein, binds to a six tetratricopeptide motif in KLCs to transport the cargo, amyloid precursor protein (APP; 10); KIF17 forms a complex with mLin10 in the transportation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2B subunits to the synapse (11Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 12Guillaud L. Setou M. Hirokawa N. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 131-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) is an adaptor protein linking the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) subtype of glutamate receptor containing vesicles to KIF5 (13Setou M. Seog D.H. Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Takei Y. Kawagishi M. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2002; 417: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In this report, we have studied the interaction between GRIF-1 and the prototypic kinesin-1, KIF5C, and kinesin light chain. The results obtained provide supporting evidence that GRIF-1 is a kinesin adaptor protein involved in motor-dependent trafficking of organelles and/or proteins.

The kinesin heavy-chain KIF5C fragments, corresponding to the motor domain (1-335), the non-motor domain (336-957), coil 1 (336-542), coil 2 (594-804), and the cargo binding domain, coil 3 (827-957), were PCR-amplified from the construct, pBluescriptSKII+KIAA0531 and cloned in-frame into the EcoR1 and SalI restriction sites of the modified mammalian expression vector, pCMVTag4a, to generate the constructs pCMV-KIF5C-(1-335), pCMV-KIF5C-(336-957), pCMV-KIF5C-(336-542), pCMV-KIF5C-(593-804), and pCMV-KIF5C-(827-957) each with an N-terminal c-Myc tag. The same fragments were also cloned into the EcoR1 and SalI restriction sites of the DNA binding domain yeast expression vector, pMBL33, to generate the constructs, pMBL33-KIF5C-(1-335), pMBL33-KIF5C-(336-957), pMBL33-KIF5C-(336-542), pMBL33-KIF5C-(593-804), and pMBL33-KIF5C-(827-957).

Full-length GRIF-1 was amplified from pCISGRIF-1 by PCR and subcloned in-frame in the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites of pECFP-C1 (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to generate pECFP-GRIF-1, i.e. GRIF-1 with an N-terminal enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) tag. KIF5C was amplified from pcDNAHisMaxKIF5C and subcloned into either the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites of pEYFP-C1 (BD Biosciences, Clontech) to generate pEYFP-KIF5C, i.e. KIF5C with an N-terminal tag, or into the NheI site of pEYFP to generate pKIF5C-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), i.e. KIF5C with a C-terminal EYFP tag. The KIF5C motor domain, KIF5C-(1-335), and KIF5C non-motor domain, KIF5C-(336-957), were amplified by PCR from pcDNAHisMaxKIF5C. KIF5C-(1-335) was subcloned in-frame in the XhoI/EcoRI sites and KIF5C-(336-957) in the NheI site, respectively, of pEYFP to generate pEYFP-KIF5C-(1-335) with an EYFP tag at the N terminus and pEYFP-KIF5C-(336-957) with an EYFP tag at the C-terminal end of KIF5C. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (MWG-Biotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany). Further, for all constructs used in yeast two-hybrid interaction assays, the expression of fusion proteins was verified by immunoblotting (data not shown).

Protein A (rabbit polyclonal antibodies) or protein G (sheep polyclonal antibodies) Sepharose (20 μl) was added, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Immune pellets were collected by centrifugation for 3 s at 10,000 × g and washed with 3 × 1.5 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 145 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, benzamidine (1 μg/ml), bacitracin (1 μg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), chicken egg trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then were analyzed by immunoblotting. Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assays—Yeast two-hybrid assays were carried out using a modified LexA system as described previously (5Brickley K. Smith M.J. Beck M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14723-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, L40 (MATa his3Δ200 trp1-901 leu2-3112 ade2 LYS2::(4lexAop-HIS3) URA3::(8lexAoplacZ) GAL4), was transformed with combinations of GRIF-1 fragments in the activation domain (AD) plasmid, pGADT7, together with each of the KIF5C fragments in the DNA binding domain plasmid, pMBL33. Negative control transformations were carried out using empty AD or DNA binding domain vectors. Positive control transformations were carried out using AD-GRIF-1-(8-633) with pMBL33β2-IL, i.e. the DNA binding domain vector containing the residues 303-427 of the intracellular loop of the GABAA receptor β2 subunit. Resulting colonies were assessed for reporter gene activation by growth on nutritional selection agar lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Confocal Microscopy and FRET Efficiency Determinations— Transfected cells 20-40 h post-transfection were rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by fixation for 10 min with 4% (w/v) ice-cold paraformaldehyde. Coverslips were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted onto a microscope slide using 10 μl of mounting solution containing an anti-fading agent (Citifluor, Citifluor Ltd., Leicester, UK). The coverslips were sealed and kept at 4 °C until analysis. For visualization of cells transfected with pCM-VKLC, post-fixation coverslips were incubated with anti-c-Myc antibodies (1:4000) overnight at 37 °C, washed as described (1Beck M. Brickley K. Wilkinson H. Sharma S. Smith M. Chazot P.L. Pollard S. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30079-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and incubated with anti-mouse-Ig Alexa Fluor 633, and again washed as previously described (1Beck M. Brickley K. Wilkinson H. Sharma S. Smith M. Chazot P.L. Pollard S. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30079-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells were imaged using an inverted LSM510 META Zeiss confocal microscope in the multitrack mode. EYFP was excited with the λ = 514 nm laser line, and emitted light was collected with a long pass filter LP530. ECFP was excited at λ = 458 nm, and light was collected with a band-pass filter BP 475-525. The absence of bleed-through was checked prior to each experiment by using the Meta software of the microscope. This software enables the decomposition of the mixed emission spectra (i.e. generated from cells co-transfected with both ECFP and EYFP) into the emission of the single fluorescent dyes, i.e. ECFP and EYFP, according to reference spectra generated from cells transfected with either ECFP or EYFP alone. Images were analyzed using the Image Browser software (Zeiss) available with the microscope. For FRET analyses, again the Meta software mode of the LSM510 META Zeiss confocal microscope was used. FRET efficiency was measured by acceptor photobleaching as described previously by Liu et al. (15Liu J. Ernst S.A. Gladycheva S.E. Lee F.Y.Y. Lentz S.I. Ho C.S. Li Q. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55924-55936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Nashmi et al. (16Nashmi R. Dickinson M.E. McKinney S. Jareb M. Labarca C. Fraser S.E. Lester H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11554-11567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That is, co-transfected HEK 293 cells were firstly imaged with the λ = 458 nm laser to visualize ECFP-tagged proteins. A defined area of co-localization within one cell was selected, and EYFP was photobleached for ∼30 s using the λ = 514 nm laser at full power. Cells were imaged post-photobleaching with the λ = 458 nm laser. FRET was measured as the increase of ECFP fluorescence after photobleaching where values were taken at t = 1.6 s prior to photobleaching and t = ∼32 s post-photobleaching and were corrected for background fluorescence (usually of the order of ∼10%) determined by the imaging of untransfected HEK 293 cells. The relative FRET efficiency was calculated by the following: (1 - [pre-bleached intensity of ECFP/post-bleached intensity of ECFP]) × 100% (14Pozo K. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. Soc. Transact. 2006; 34: 48-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For each FRET experiment, pseudo-FRET was always determined by applying the photobleaching protocol to cells transfected with pECFP alone. Pseudo-FRET values (typically ∼2.9%) were always subtracted from the calculated FRET efficiencies of the test samples. As a further control, an area of the cell that was not photobleached was also analyzed in parallel for FRET to ensure that the FRET efficiency values determined were not artifacts due to the photobleaching protocol. A positive control, an ECFP-EYFP tandem construct linked by two amino acids (17He L. Bradrick T.D. Karpova T.S. Wu X. Fox M.H. Fischer R. McNally J.G. Knutson J.R. Grammer A.C. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 53A: 39-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and a negative control, co-transfection of the separate clones pECFP and pEYFP, were both used to validate the system. We have previously shown that GRIF-1 associates with endogenous kinesin in the brain and in the heart by co-immunoprecipitation of GRIF-1 and kinesin using anti-GRIF-1874-889 antibodies. Association was also demonstrated, again by co-immunoprecipitation, between exogenous GRIF-1 and exogenous KIF5C both co-expressed in HEK 293 cells. Further, yeast two-hybrid interaction assays using GRIF-1 and KIF5C as fish and bait, respectively, suggested that association between the two proteins is probably direct and involves the first coiled-coil domain of GRIF-1, GRIF-1-(124-283) (5Brickley K. Smith M.J. Beck M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14723-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To delineate the GRIF-1 binding domain of KIF5C initially, the KIF5C motor domain, i.e. KIF5C-(1-335), and KIF5C non-motor domain, i.e. KIF5C-(336-957), were subcloned in-frame into either the yeast two-hybrid DNA binding domain vector, pMBL33, or the modified mammalian expression vector, pCMVTag4a, to yield N-terminally c-Myc-tagged fusion proteins. The association between GRIF-1 and KIF5C was then studied by both yeast two-hybrid interaction assays and immunoprecipitation strategies following the co-expression of GRIF-1 and KIF5C in HEK 293 cells. The results are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2.TABLE 1GRIF-1 interacts directly with the KIF5C non-motor domain: demonstration by yeast two-hybrid interaction assays The yeast strain, L40, was co-transformed with bait and fish constructs and transformants grown on -2 SD, i.e. -W and -L, and -3 SD, i.e. -W, -L, and -H.

An interaction was also found between both GRIF-1-(8-633) and GRIF-1-(124-283) and KIF5C-(336-957). This was in contrast to yeast co-transformed with KIF5C-(1-335) and either full-length or truncated GRIF-1 constructs where no evidence for protein-protein association was found (Table 1). The same results were obtained in immunoprecipitation studies. FLAG-tagged GRIF-1 was co-expressed in HEK 293 cells with either c-Myc-tagged KIF5C-(1-335) (43 kDa) or KIF5C-(336-957) (98 kD"
https://openalex.org/W2017720459,"In articular chondrocytes, the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induces the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), a growth factor known to be involved in the induction of cartilage and bone. A study was performed to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the induction of BMP-2 in chondrogenic ATDC5 cells and primary cultured adult human articular chondrocytes. In ATDC5 cells, the endogenous BMP-2 expression was consistently low throughout the process of chondrogenic differentiation, and TNF-α induced BMP-2 expression only after the cells acquired the chondrogenic phenotype. The results of nuclear run-off assay and cycloheximide treatment consistently indicated that ATDC5 cells acquire the capacity to synthesize BMP-2 mRNA in the nuclei during the differentiation process. In an attempt to explain the discrepancy between the active nuclear mRNA synthesis and the observed low expression level in differentiated ATDC5 cells, the stability of BMP-2 mRNA was evaluated, and the cells were found to regulate the expression of BMP-2 at the post-transcriptional level. Human chondrocytes were confirmed to have a similar post-transcriptional regulation. The result of 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end revealed that both human and mouse BMP-2 mRNAs contain multiple pentameric AUUUA motifs in a conserved manner in the 3′-untranslated regions, and transient transfection experiments demonstrated that TNF-α increases the stability of BMP-2 mRNA through the pentameric motifs. Further experiments revealed that TNF-α modulates mRNA stability via p38 signal transduction pathway, whereas the cytokine also augmented the expression of BMP-2 through transcriptional up-regulation via the transcriptional factor NF-κB.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; UTR, untranslated region; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; GAPDH, glyceroaldehyde-3-phsophate dehydrogenase; ARE, AU-rich element; nt, nucleotide; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκBα, inhibitor of κBα; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; CHX, cycloheximide; ActD, actinomycin D; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA. are a group of secreted signaling proteins that were originally identified by their ability to induce ectopic bone formation (1Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4502) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of the BMPs later revealed that the proteins belong to the transforming growth factor-β superfamily (2Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). The evolutionary conservation of BMPs is remarkable. For example, the amino acid sequence of Drosophila protein decapentaplegic (dpp) is ∼75% identical to human BMP-2 and is functionally interchangeable with recombinant human protein as to its ability to ectopically induce bone formation in rodents (3Sampath T.K. Rashka K.F. Doctor J.S. Tucker R.F. Hoffmann F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6004-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). BMPs are critical in embryonal development and postnatal growth. Among them, BMP-2 plays a vital role in fetal development. Mice lacking functional BMP-2 gene die during early embryogenesis due to malformation of the proamniotic canal and a defect in cardiac development (4Zhang H. Bradley A. Development. 1996; 122: 2977-2986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that the growth factor is involved in various aspects of development such as skin and hair formation, neural cell differentiation, and cartilage and bone formation (5Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). The role of BMP-2 in skeletal development is particularly crucial. At the early stage of embryogenesis, BMP-2 is expressed in specific areas of limb buds to form prechondrogenic condensations, and it later promotes cellular differentiation into chondrocytes (6Pizette S. Niswander L. Dev. Biol. 2000; 219: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Besides its roles in developmental and growth processes, BMP-2 is also expressed in postnatal animals and is often associated with various pathologies. The growth factor is expressed in the process of bone healing where it regulates cellular differentiation, proliferation, and matrix production (7Bostrom M.P. Lane J.M. Berberian W.S. Missri A.A.

Sci. 1997; 105: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Various tumors have been found to express BMP-2. Indeed, this protein is known to exert diverse effects on tumor cells, ranging from the facilitation of tumor growth to the induction of cellular apoptosis (9Hallahan A.R. Pritchard J.I. Chandraratna R.A.S. Ellenbogen R.G. Geyer J.R. Overland R.P. Strand A.D. Topcott S.J. Olson J.M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10Kleeff J. Maruyama H.

We and other investigators have found that BMP-2 is expressed at high levels in arthritic joints by both chondrocytes and synovial cells, possibly promoting chondrocyte anabolism and osteophyte formation (12Fukui N.

Anat. 2003; 202: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because of its potent biological actions, the expression of BMP-2 must be strictly regulated in vivo. In fact, BMP-2 is expressed in a highly tissue- and stage-specific pattern during embryogenesis (17Lyons K.M. Pelton R.W. Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 18Lyons K.M. Pelton R.W. Hogan B.L. Development. 1990; 109: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and either enhancement or inhibition of its activity is know to cause a significant disturbance in skeletal formation (19Macias D. Gañan Y. Sampath T.K. Piedra M.E. Ros M.A. Hurle J.M. Development. 1997; 124: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhang D. Ferguson C.M. O'Keefe R.J. Puzas J.E. Roiser R.N. Reynolds P.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, although the function of BMP-2 has been extensively studied, less is known about the mechanisms that regulate production of the growth factor. To date, several studies have shown that the expression of the gene is regulated at the transcriptional level. Retinoic acid induces BMP-2 expression through transcriptional activation in osteoblastic cells, possibly via retinoic acid receptor γ (21Abrams K.L. Xu J. Nativelle-Serpentini C. Dabirshahsahebi S.

NF-κB has been shown to regulate the transcriptional activity of BMP-2 in growth plate chondrocytes during endochondral bone development (24Feng J.Q. Xing L. Zhang J.-H. Zhao M. Horn D. Chan J. Boyce B.F. Harris S.E. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29130-29135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity might be enhanced by estrogen (25Zhou S. Turgeman G. Harris S.E. Leitman D.C. Komm B.S. Bodine P.V.N. Gazit D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and, interestingly, by BMP-2 itself (26Ghosh-Choudhury N. Choudhury C.G. Harris M.A. Wozney J. Mundy G.R. Abboud S.L. Harris S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, transcriptional regulation is considered to play an important role in expression of the protein. On the other hand, BMP-2 expression could also be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Computer analyses have revealed that the proximal part of the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of BMP-2 gene is highly conserved across a wide range of species (21Abrams K.L. Xu J. Nativelle-Serpentini C. Dabirshahsahebi S. Rogers M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15916-15928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Fritz D.T. Liu D. Xu J. Jiang S. Rogers M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48950-48958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). That fact suggests the involvement of post-transcriptional regulation for the expression of BMP-2, because 3′-UTRs of mRNA often contain sequences to regulate post-transcriptional events (28St Johnston D. Cell. 1995; 81: 161-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 29Mignone F. Gissi C. Liuni S. Pesole G. Genome Biology. 2002; http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/3/reviews/0004PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, a recent report has shown that degradation of the gene transcripts could be regulated by the region (27Fritz D.T. Liu D. Xu J. Jiang S. Rogers M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48950-48958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, details of the regulatory mechanism are not yet known, and the biological significance of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation has yet to be established. We and others recently reported that the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and TNF-α induce BMP-2 expression in adult articular chondrocytes and a chondrosarcoma cell line (12Fukui N. Zhu Y. Maloney W.J. Clohisy J. Sandell L.J. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 2003; 85A: 59-66Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 30Shi J. Schmitt-Talbot E. DiMattia D.A. Dullea R.G. Inflamm. Res. 2004; 53: 377-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar BMP-2 induction by those cytokines is also observed in synovial cells (14Lories R.J. Derese I. Ceuppens J.L. Luyten F.P. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2807-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Fowler Jr., M.J. Neff M.S. Borghaei R.C. Pease E.A. Mochan E. Thornton R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and could be a widespread event in arthritic joints. In this study, the mechanism of BMP-2 induction by TNF-α was studied in chondrogenic ATDC5 cells and primary cultured adult human articular chondrocytes. Our results indicated that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation are involved in the induction of BMP-2. Cell Culture—ATDC5 cells were obtained from the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (DMEM/F-12, Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum, Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml human transferrin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), and 3 × 10-8 m sodium selenite (Sigma) (32Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To induce chondrogenic differentiation, bovine insulin (Sigma) was added to the media at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Human chondrocytes were obtained from 29 osteoarthritic knee joints in 28 patients at the time of joint replacement surgery. The material collection was performed under the approval of institutional review boards, and informed consent in writing was obtained from all patients. Articular chondrocytes were liberated from cartilage tissue by sequential enzymic digestion of 0.5% Pronase (Calbiochem) and 0.025% collagenase P (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) (33Kuettner K.E. Pauli B.U. Gall G. Memoli V.A. Schenk R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Isolated cells were plated onto 6- or 12-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/cm2 and cultured in DMEM/F-12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma). For cartilage explants, full thickness articular cartilage was aseptically obtained from metacarpophalangeal joints of adult bovine animals and punched out into discs 3 mm in diameter. The explants were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml ascorbic acid. For the inhibitors used in the study, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, ionomycin, and wortmannin were purchased from Sigma, U0126 and SP600125 were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and SB202190, SB202474, SB203580, PD98059, and GF109203X were obtained from Calbiochem. Recombinant mouse and human TNF-α were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); recombinant mouse noggin was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Real-time Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from the cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with DNaseI (Qiagen) treatment, and 1 μg of total RNA was employed to synthesize cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics). The cDNA was then used for real-time quantitative PCR on a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics). For mouse BMP-2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes, respective pairs of gene-specific hybridization probes labeled with fluorescein (Flu) and LightCycler-Red640 (LC640) dyes, respectively, were used to monitor the amount of PCR product. The primer sequences were 5′-TGCACCAAGATGAACACAG-3′ and 5′-GCTGTTTGTGTTTGGCTTG-3′ for BMP-2, and 5′-TGAACGGGAAGCTCACTGG-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ for GAPDH. The probe sequences were 5′-TCGTTTGTGGAGCGGATGTCCTTTT/Flu/-3′ and 5′-/LC640/CATCATGTCCAAAAGTCACTAGCAATGGC-3′ for BMP-2, and 5′-CTGAGGACCAGGTTGTCTCCTGCGA/Flu/-3′ and 5′-/LC640/TTCAACAGCAACTCCCACTCTTCCACC-3′ for GAPDH (Nihon Gene Research Laboratory, Sendai, Japan). PCR of human BMP-2, RelA, Iκbα, and GAPDH genes was performed using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics), and the amount of PCR product was monitored by the intensity of fluorescence from the dye bound to the product. The primer sequences were 5′-CCCCGGGGTATCACGCCTTT-3′ and 5′-GCGACACCCACAACCCTCCA-3′ for BMP-2, 5′-CAGAGTTACCTACCAGGGCTATTC-3′ and 5′-TCTGACTCTGTGTCATAGCTCTCC-3′ for RelA, 5′-ACGAGCTTGTAGGAAAGGACTG-3′ and 5′-GCTGCTCTTCTATAGGAACTTGGA-3′ for IκBα, and 5′-CAGGGACTCCCCAGCAGT-3′ and 5′-GGCATTGCCCTCAACGACCA-3′ for GAPDH. The PCR protocol was the same for all genes, i.e. 95 °C for 10 min to activate Taq polymerase, then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 6 s. When SYBR green dye was used to monitor PCR, melting curves were routinely recorded to verify the singularity of the PCR product. In each sample, the level of cDNA was normalized by the expression of GAPDH. Nuclear Run-off Assay—ATDC5 cells were seeded to 225-cm2 flasks at a density of 2 × 103/cm2 and incubated under the aforementioned conditions. Soon after reaching confluency or following 15 days of culture in the insulin-containing media, the cells were incubated for another 48 h in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml of recombinant mouse TNF-α. The cells were then harvested, lysed in 4 ml of the Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The nuclei thus obtained were resuspended in glycerol storage buffer (40% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen until use. RNA transcripts were labeled by incubation of the nuclei in a reaction buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.5 mm GTP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (10 mCi/ml, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) for 30 min at 30 °C. Nuclei from 1-3 × 108 cells were used for each transcript reaction. The reaction mixture was treated with DNase I and proteinase K, and RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. pCR2.1 vectors (Invitrogen) containing cDNAs for the entire mouse BMP-2 3′-UTR, partial mouse GAPDH, and full-length mouse β-actin were prepared respectively, together with an empty vector. Five micrograms of each plasmid was linearized by HindIII digestion, denatured with 0.2 m NaOH, blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, GE Healthcare), and immobilized by UV-cross-linking. The membrane was pre-hybridized with ULTRAhyb (Ambion, Austin, TX), and hybridization was then allowed to proceed at 42 °C for 14-16 h. The membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC at 65 °C, treated with RNase A, and washed again in 2 × SSC at 37 °C. The analysis was performed by phosphorimaging using a Typhoon 9410 (GE Healthcare) with ImageQuaNT software (GE Healthcare). 3′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—The 3′-end of mouse BMP-2 gene was determined using a GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, total RNA was extracted from bone tissues of C57BL/6 mice, and cDNA was synthesized using an oligo(dT)-adapter primer provided by the kit. The first PCR was performed using 1 μg of the synthesized cDNA as a template with mGSP1 (5′-AGAAAACGTCTCGCCACCCTCC-3′) and 3′ primer for the adaptor. The PCR product containing the 3′-end of human BMP-2 mRNA was obtained by using a nested PCR using the first PCR product as a template, and mGSP2 (5′-TACATTTGCCTGACACGCAGCA-3′) and the 3′-nested primer provided by the kit as primers. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1 vector and subjected to DNA sequencing. The 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends of human BMP-2 mRNA was performed in the same manner, using total RNA from primary cultured chondrocytes to generate cDNA, and an external primer hGSP1 (5′-TGGCACGTCCGGGTTACCATGTTCATTA-3′) and an internal primer hGSP2 (5′-TGAAGCCCTTACAGGCCAAAGGACCACA-3′) for the first and nested PCR, respectively. DNA sequences were determined by using the Long-Read Tower System (GE Healthcare). Three clones were sequenced for each gene. Plasmid Constructions—Luciferase reporter expression constructs harboring mouse BMP-2 3′-UTR at the 3′-end of the luciferase coding region were prepared in pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) expression vector (Invitrogen). The luciferase cDNA was generated from pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) by PCR and cloned into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+). cDNA for the entire 3′-UTR of mouse BMP-2 was generated by PCR and subcloned into pCR2.1 vector. Using the vector as a template, specific regions of the 3′-UTR were amplified by PCR and ligated into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) between the EcoRI and XbaI sites. Thus, either the entire or a specific region of mouse BMP-2 3′-UTR was placed between the luciferase gene and the BGH polyadenylation site of the vector. All constructs were analyzed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Transient Transfection Assays—Transient transfection experiments were performed in differentiated ATDC5 cells using each of the prepared luciferase vectors and a phRL-TK vector (Promega). The cells were plated on 12-well plates, and differentiation was induced as previously described. DNA transfection was carried out using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). For each well, 0.5 μg of the luciferase vector and 1.5 μg of phRL-TK vector were mixed with 4 μl of Super-Fect reagent and 75 μl of DMEM/F-12 medium, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The reagent mixture was combined with 400 μl of the complete culture medium, which was transferred to the washed cell monolayer in each well. After incubation for 14-18 h, the medium containing transfection reagent was replaced with the complete medium. For some experiments, recombinant mouse TNF-α was added to the medium at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. The transfected cells were cultured for 48 h and then lysed in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was assayed on a luminometer (JNR AB-2100, Atto, Tokyo, Japan) using a Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega). All transfection experiments were repeated at least three times in duplicate. Preparation of Adenovirus Vector and Gene Transduction— The recombinant adenovirus vector carrying constitutively active MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6) gene under the control of chicken β-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus IE enhancer was generated by the DNA-terminal protein complex method (34Seto H. Kamekura S. Miura T. Yamamoto A. Chikuda H. Ogata T. Hiraoka H. Oda H. Nakamura K. Kurosawa H. Chung U.-I. Kawaguchi H. Tanaka S. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The adenovirus carrying β-galactosidase was obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Titers of the adenovirus were determined by an Adeno-X Rapid Titer kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. The titer was represented by the multiplicity of infection. To infect the adenovirus vectors in cultured human chondrocytes, the culture media in each well of 6- or 12-well plates was replaced by 1.0 or 0.5 ml of serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium containing the adenoviruses at the indicated multiplicity of infection. The cells were incubated for 2 h under normal culture conditions, after which 5 times the volume of the complete medium was added to each well. Western Blotting—Approximately 1 × 106 cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing proteinase inhibitors (0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics)) for 10 min on ice with occasional mixing. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Twenty micrograms of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE with 8-16% polyacrylamide separating gel in the reducing condition and electronically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking, the membrane was incubated with either anti-p38 MAP kinase or anti-phopho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Thy-182) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and then with the secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoreactive protein was finally visualized using a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). RNAi Experiments—The expression of p65 subunit of NF-κB or RelA and IκBα was suppressed by RNAi in primary cultured human chondrocytes. All siRNAs were purchased from Qiagen, and two siRNAs with distinctive sequences were used for each gene. The sense strand sequences of the RNA duplexes were as follows: RelA#1, 5′-GGACAUAUGAGACCUUCAAdTdT-3′; RelA#2, 5′-GAUUGAGGAGAAACGUAAAdTdT-3′; IκBα#1, 5′-GGGUGUACUUAUAUCCACATdT-3′; IκBα#2, 5′-GGGCCAGCUGACACUAGAAdTdT-3′; and control siRNA, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′. The siRNAs were delivered into human chondrocytes by electroporation following cell isolation from cartilage matrix. Electroporation was performed using a Nucleofector® device and a Human Chondrocyte Nucleofector kit (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 1 × 106 cells were suspended in 100 μl of the electroporation buffer provided by the kit, along with 1.5 μl of 68 μm stock solution of siRNA. Thus, the final concentration of siRNA in the buffer was ∼100 nm. The buffer was then transferred to a supplied cuvette, and electroporation was performed using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. After electroporation, the cells were immediately transferred onto each well of 12-well plates and cultured in DMEM/F-12 containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Next day, the media were replaced to the aforementioned regular culture media for human chondrocytes. The viability of cells was ∼60% with the procedure. Incorporation of [35S]Sulfate into Cartilage Explants—For this experiment, 20-40 cartilage explants were prepared from normal bovine articular cartilage and equally divided into 4 groups. The first group was cultured in the aforementioned culture medium for 6 days, while changing the medium every 2 days. The second group was first cultured in the same medium for 4 days, and then for 2 days in a medium containing recombinant mouse noggin (1 μg/ml). The third and fourth groups were initially cultured in a medium containing 2.5 ng/ml recombinant human TNF-α for 4 days. The third group was then cultured in the regular culture medium for 2 days, whereas the fourth group was cultured in a medium containing 1 μg/ml recombinant noggin. For all four groups, newly synthesized sulfated proteoglycan was radiolabeled for the last 8 h of culture with 10 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate (GE Healthcare). The explants were then recovered, extensively rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to papain digestion. The digestion was performed using 50 μg/ml papain (Sigma) in 500 μl of digestion buffer (0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0) at 60 °C over-night. The digest was then centrifuged, and 20 μl of supernatant was used to measure the radioactivity. DNA content was also determined using a PicoGreen® double-stranded DNA quantitation kit (Invitrogen), and the radioactivity was normalized by the amount of DNA. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry of cartilage explants was performed following a previously described method (12Fukui N. Zhu Y. Maloney W.J. Clohisy J. Sandell L.J. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 2003; 85A: 59-66Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, 6-μm-thick cryosections were prepared from the explants, fixed in acetone, and digested with 1.0% hyaluronidase (Sigma) for antigen retrieval. To detect the presence of BMP-2, anti-human BMP-2 goat polyclonal antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at the concentration of 1:100, which was visualized with the avidine-linked peroxidase system (goat ABC staining system, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) coupled with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). The sections were observed under a light microscope without nuclei staining, to facilitate direct comparison of the staining intensities among the sections. Statistical Analyses—For statistical analyses, data were compared using one-way factorial analysis of variance, and when necessary, Fisher's PLSD was used as a post-hoc test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. TNF-α and Cycloheximide Induced BMP-2 Expression in Differentiated, Not Undifferentiated, ATDC5 Cells—As a preliminary experiment, the time course of chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells was determined by evaluating the expression of type II procollagen and aggrecan as well as type X procollagen from Day 0 until Day 25, every 5 days after addition of insulin to the media. Under our experimental conditions, the expression of type II procollagen and aggrecan began to increase at Day 10 and rose continuously up to Day 25 (data not shown). Meanwhile, the expression level of type X procollagen was very low from Day 0 to Day 15 and then was up-regulated at Day 20 and beyond (data not shown), indicating the occurrence of"
https://openalex.org/W1963672962,"Cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA), an analog of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), was previously identified in human serum. Although cPA possesses distinct physiological activities not elicited by LPA, its biochemical origins have scarcely been studied. In the present study, we assayed cPA formation from lysophosphatidylcholine in fetal bovine serum and found significant activity of transphosphatidylation that generated cPA. The cPA-producing enzyme was purified from fetal bovine serum using five chromatographic steps yielding a 100-kDa protein with cPA biosynthetic activity. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of its tryptic peptides revealed that the enzyme shared identical fragments with human autotaxin, a serum lysophospholipase D that produces LPA. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the 100-kDa protein was specifically recognized by an anti-human autotaxin antibody. Moreover, recombinant rat autotaxin was found to generate cPA in addition to LPA. No significant cPA- or LPA-producing activity was detected in autotaxin-depleted serum from bovine or human prepared by immunoprecipitation with an anti-autotaxin monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that the generation of cPA and LPA in serum is mainly attributed to autotaxin."
https://openalex.org/W2079099795,"It has recently become clear that various aspects of nucleic acid metabolism and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway intersect in several direct and important ways. To begin to assess the scope of some of these activities in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we assessed the physical and functional association of proteasomal proteins from both the 20 S core and 19 S regulatory particles with ∼6400 yeast genes. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that proteasome substituents are associated with the majority of yeast genes. Many of these associations correlated strongly with expression levels and the presence of RNA polymerase II. Although the data support the presence of the intact 26 S proteasome on most genes, several hundred yeast genes were cross-linked to either the 20 or 19 S complex but not both, consistent with some degree of independent function for the proteasomal subcomplexes.

The 26 S proteasome is responsible for the majority of nonlysosomal protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. It is comprised of two major subspecies, the 20 S proteolytic core and the 19 S regulatory particle (1Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). The 19 S regulatory particle (2Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) sits atop these openings and is thought to regulate the access of most substrates to the interior of the 20 S core and to unwind proteins for degradation. Recently work from several laboratories has uncovered a number of direct roles for the proteasome in nucleic acid metabolism, including mRNA transcription (3Collins G.A. Tansey W.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 4Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 5Ottosen S.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For example, proteasome-mediated degradation is known to regulate the levels and thus the activities of many gene-specific transcription factors. The proteasome has also been implicated in recycling of transcription complexes at active promoters (7Reid G. Hübner M.R. Metivier R. Brand H. Denger S. Manu D. Beaudouin J. Ellenberg J. Gannon F.

Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis has also revealed association of the proteasome with the coding regions of transcribed genes with particularly high occupancy at regions of stalled polymerase complexes, such as sites of DNA damage or near termination sequences (9Gillette T.G.

Cell. 2004; 13: 435-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In mRNA transcription, they have been shown to strongly stimulate the promoter escape and elongation steps of in vitro transcription reactions. In vivo they stimulate the recruitment of chromatin-remodeling complexes to active promoters and are essential for transcription of several GAL and heat shock genes. These activities do not depend on proteolysis and, in some cases, have been reported to occur independently of the 20 S core complex. To evaluate the generality of these studies, which have been performed on a few genes or using in vitro methods, we undertook a global analysis of the physical and functional association of proteasomal proteins with gene-coding sequences in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by analysis of the enriched DNAs on microarrays (the so-called ChIP 3The abbreviations used are: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Pol, polymerase. to chip method (21Sikder D. Kodadek T. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2005; 9: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Horak C.E. Snyder M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)) we demonstrated that proteasomal proteins are associated with the majority of yeast genes. By carrying out this experiment under different conditions that affect the expression of certain genes, we can conclude that many, but not all, of these proteasome-gene associations are transcription-dependent. Gene expression profiling suggests that many of the physical associations observed have functional consequences. Interestingly the ChIP to chip data reveal that although both 20 and 19 S proteins are present on many genes, there are hundreds that contain one or the other but not both. In addition to supporting the contention that the ATPases can function independently of the 20 S core complex (14Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), these data also suggest the existence of a 19 S-independent 20 S core-containing complex on many genes. These results confirm that the proteasome and/or its subcomplexes are involved broadly in nucleic acid metabolism, particularly RNA polymerase II transcription, and are consistent with the idea that these proteins play diverse roles in these processes. Finally we note that while this manuscript was in preparation another global study of proteasomal protein-gene interactions in yeast was published (23Auld K.L. Brown C.R. Casolari J.M. Komilli S. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The data discussed below agree with the conclusions of that study and also extend them in several ways. Microarrays—Total RNA was isolated using the hot phenol method (24Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). mRNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Cyscribe postlabeling kit was used to prepare Cy3-labeled cDNA probes (Amersham Biosciences catalogue number RPN5660). Cy3-labeled cDNA was purified using Cyscribe GFX purification kit (Amersham Biosciences catalogue number 27-9606-01). 15 pmol of CyDye in hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences catalogue number RPN5660) was applied to Affymetrix S20 arrays. Hybridization was at 42 °C for 16 h in a hybridization chamber. Slides were washed at 25 °C for 10 min with 1× SSC, 0.2% SDS buffer prewarmed to 55 °C. This was followed by two additional washes of 10 min each with 0.1× SSC buffer containing 0.2% SDS prewarmed to 55 °C. Slides were then washed thrice with 0.1× SSC at 25 °C. Slides were dipped in distilled water for 5 s and dried. The slides were scanned in a GenePix Personal 4100A microarray scanner (Axon Instruments) and analyzed using Genespring (Silicon Genetics). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (14Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). 1 μgof anti-Sug1 antibody and anti-20 S antibody were used to immunoprecipitate protein-DNA complexes. FLAG-tagged Pre1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma catalogue number A2220). Primers used for ChIP analyses are provided in the supporting information. Culture Conditions—Strains sug1-20, pre1-1/4-1, and their parental strains were grown in YEP (yeast extract peptone) containing 2% raffinose at 25 °C and then shifted to 37 °C for 2 h. Full-length mRNA was isolated following exposure to galactose for 45 min. mRNA was isolated and reverse transcribed, and the cDNAs obtained were amplified using gene-specific primers (described in supplemental data). For treatment with proteasome inhibitor, cells were exposed to 100 μm MG132 (Peptide Institute) for 2 h and then exposed to galactose for 45 min. When working with polymerase-conditional mutants, Pol I (rpa190-2), Pol II (rpb1-1), and Pol III (rpc160-112) strains were grown exponentially in raffinose. Cells were then shifted to 37 °C for 30 min and exposed to galactose or glucose (2%) for 30 min. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and Quantitative PCR— Total RNA was isolated using the hot phenol method and purified by RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen). mRNA was converted to cDNA using Reverse Transcription System A3500 (Promega). Gene-specific primers designed to amplify the 3′-end of the genes (see supplemental data) were used in PCR. Quantitative PCRs (Q-PCR) were performed using Platinum SYBR Green Q-PCR SuperMix-UDG (Bio-Rad). The data were normalized according to the ΔΔCt method (25Livak K.J. Scmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127156) Google Scholar) and analyzed statistically using a Student's t test. p values less than 0.05 were deemed significantly different. Genomic Localization Analysis—Array-ready yeast 70-mer oligonucleotides (Operon) representing ∼6400 genes were printed in triplicate spots on a glass slide. 99 spots of synthetic DNA with no appreciable sequence identity to any of the yeast open reading frames served as negative controls. Yeast cells were grown in YEP medium containing 2% raffinose to A600 of 0.4. Cells either continued to be grown in raffinose-containing medium or were exposed to galactose for 1 h at which time cells were treated with formaldehyde. Sonicated cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using polyclonal antibodies raised against Sug1, Sug2, or 20 S proteasome. FLAG beads were used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged Pre1-DNA complex. DNA retrieved following elution was repaired using T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs catalogue number M0203S). Repaired DNA was ligated to annealed linkers using 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase at 16 °C for 16 h (New England Biolabs catalogue number M0202S). For all arrays ChIP DNA was labeled with Cy5, and input DNA was labeled with Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences catalogue numbers PA53021 and PA55021, respectively). The data from the triplicate experiments were median-scaled and normalized to each other. 20 pmol of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled DNA were mixed and hybridized to a spotted microarray representing ∼6400 genes. Hybridization was performed in 3× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 20 pmol of denatured probe, and 10 μg of tRNA at 50 °C for 20 h. Slides were washed, dried, and scanned to obtain an image and the intensities associated with each of the spots. Raw intensity from each experiment was log10-transformed. To obtain a Z-score we subtracted the overall average gene intensity from the raw intensity data for each gene. This value was divided by the standard deviation of all the measured intensities. The following formula was used. Z score = (intensityX - mean intensityX1...Xn)/S.D.X1...Xn where X is any gene represented in the array and X1... Xn is the cumulative measure of all the genes represented in the array. Extensive Association of Proteasomal Proteins with Yeast Genes—We have reported previously efficient conditions for the analysis of proteasomal protein-chromatin interactions using ChIP analysis and antibodies against Sug1/Rpt6, Sug2/Rpt4, and Pre1 (9Gillette T.G. Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5904-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These conditions were used in a global analysis of proteasome-chromatin interactions. For these experiments a spotted DNA microarray comprised of 70-residue oligonucleotide probes complementary to the coding regions of 6400 S. cerevisiae genes in triplicate was used. As a control to test the accuracy of genome-wide location analysis, we amplified a 500-bp fragment from the 3′-region of the GAL4 gene. This DNA was labeled using Cy5 and mixed with an equivalent amount of yeast genomic DNA sheared to an average length of 500 bp and labeled with Cy3. Analysis of the array following hybridization revealed three features with saturated intensity in the Cy5 channel. All three features corresponded to Gal4 cDNA. There were 21 other features above the background, but all of them were either at or below 1.5-fold over Cy3 (data not shown). We concluded that the conditions used were suitable for global analysis. The focus of the first set of experiments was the proteasomal ATPases Sug1/Rpt6 and Sug2/Rpt4. Following growth on raffinose to A600 = 0.4, cells were exposed to galactose for 2 h at which time they were treated with formaldehyde. After isolation of total chromatin and shearing by sonication, the cross-linked species of interest were immunoprecipitated using polyclonal antibodies raised against Sug1/Rpt6 or Sug2/Rpt4. These are highly specific antibodies that recognize only a single band from a crude yeast extract in a Western blot (14Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The DNA retrieved following reversal of the cross-link was amplified and labeled with Cy5 (red) dye. A control sample equivalent to the input DNA for the immunoprecipitation was amplified and labeled with Cy3 (green) dye. At least four independent ChIPs and microarray hybridizations were performed for each protein. These experiments revealed that Sug1/Rpt6 was detectable on ∼68% of the yeast open reading frames examined by the criterion of an enrichment of the immunoprecipitated DNA fragment of more than 1.5-fold over the input. For 26% of those analyzed, the enrichment was greater than 3-fold (Fig. 1A). Sug2 association with yeast chromatin was almost identical to that of Sug1 (Figs. 1B and 2A). This was expected because Sug1 and Sug2 are tightly associated and function in concert with one another (26Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J. Johnston S.A.

Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 21-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that Sug1/Rpt6 and Sug2/Rpt4 are present together on a large number of yeast genes.FIGURE 2Distribution from ChIP to chip assays of the 19 and 20 S components and direct testing by ChIP analysis.

These data represent three independent ChIP experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next addressed the localization of the 20 S core complex on the yeast genes. In the first such experiment, we used a strain in which the Pre1 protein was tagged with the FLAG epitope (28Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), and a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was used in the immunoprecipitation. Hybridization of the processed samples to the yeast microarray revealed that more than 60% of the coding regions were enriched in the Pre1-associated fraction (Fig. 1C). To ensure that the epitope tag did not affect the localization of the 20 S complex, this experiment was repeated with an untagged strain using polyclonal antibodies that had been raised using the entire 20 S complex as the antigen (Fig. 1D). We conclude that the 20 S proteasome core complex associates extensively with yeast genes. Gene Association Patterns of 20 S Core and the 19 S ATPase Are Similar but Distinct—Fig. 2, A-C, shows the relationships between the various ChIP to chip data sets in the form of scatter plots. As mentioned above, the data sets for Sug1/Rpt6 and Sug2/Rpt4 were almost identical with a correlation coefficient between the two experiments of 0.96 (Fig. 2A). As anticipated, the data obtained from the experiments that utilized antibody against native Pre1 or anti-FLAG antibody and a FLAG-tagged PRE1 strain yielded similar profiles with a correlation coefficient of 0.9 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, comparison of the Sug1/Rpt6 and 20 S core data sets show that although most of the gene associations detected are common to both proteins, many genes are associated with only the ATPase or the 20 S component but not both. These genes appear as clearly off-diagonal features on the scatter plot shown in Fig. 2C. For example, using a stringent cutoff of at least a 4-fold greater ratio in normalized signal intensity (indicated by the diagonal bars in Fig. 2C), 107 genes show strong preferential association with Pre1 over Sug1, and 152 genes show preferential association with Sug1 over Pre1. Using a less stringent 2-fold cutoff, we found 756 genes preferentially associated with Sug1, 452 genes preferentially associated with 20 S, and 3516 genes associated with both (not shown). Fig. 2D considers all of the genes in the data sets that are at least 4-fold enriched for one or both of the proteasomal proteins (i.e. the strongest signals form the array). Remarkably about one-third of these genes associate with Sug1 or Pre1 preferentially, whereas two-thirds of them show strong association with both proteins. This relatively high fraction of genes associated with one, but not both, proteasomal subcomplexes suggests that both the ATPase and 20 S complexes may play significant roles independent of one another in the nucleus. Focused Analysis of Individual Genes Confirms the Association of Independent Proteasome Subcomplexes with Several Genes—To validate these microarray-based findings, standard ChIP assays were done using each of the aforementioned antibodies, and the enriched DNA was probed using gene-specific primers for genes shown by the microarray-based data to be bound to Sug1 (ERV46 and SEC62), Pre1/20 S (GCY1, TUB2, ARN1, AGE2, HOL1, and APG10), or both proteins (SVS1, TAF9, TAF13, MUD2, BUL1, SRN2, and SPB1) (see Fig. 2E). ERV46 and SEC62, for example, showed significant association with only Sug1, not Pre1/20 S. In contrast, GCY1, TUB2, ARN1, AGE2, HOL1, and APG10 were found to be associated with Pre1/20 S but not Sug1. Both Sug1 and Pre1/20 S were associated with the SVS1, TAF9, TAF13, MUD2, BUL1, SRN2, and SPB1 genes exactly as predicted by the microarray data. Moreover neither the Sug1 or Pre1/20 S particles appeared to be associated with TIM22 or GLK1, again consistent with the microarray results. Another check of the microarray data was conducted in which we performed standard ChIP assays using the anti-Sug1 and anti-20 S antibodies and then probed the enriched DNA using specific PCR primers that tile the region of the yeast genome that includes the ARN1 gene (Fig. 2F). Based on the global analysis, the 3′-end of this gene associates with 20 S core but not 19 S regulatory particle. The two neighboring genes, YHL041W and YHL039W, are separated by 3.9 and 1.2 kb, respectively. We tiled this region with seven primer pairs (Fig. 3F) and assayed for binding of Sug1 and 20 S complex (Fig. 3G). The data show that promoters and the 3′-region of both YHL041W and YHL039W recruited Sug1 and 20 S core complex (primers 2 and 3 and primers 8 and 9). The intergenic regions did not recruit either of the complexes (primers 1, 4, and 7). Although the ARN1 promoter associated with Sug1, association with 20 S particle was just below the threshold (primer 6). The 3′-end of ARN1 was enriched for 20 S proteins but not Sug1 (primer 5). These data would seem to constitute strong evidence for independent 20 S core-gene or proteasomal ATPase-gene associations at many genes and 26 S proteasome-gene associations at even more. However, there are two alternative possibilities that, although less likely, are difficult to rule out. On one hand, it is possible that some of the genes represented in the central region of the Venn diagram in Fig. 2D might represent sites of independent gene-ATPase and gene-20 S complexes in the same region of the gene rather than association of the 26 S complex. Thus, we may be underestimating the number of independent subcomplex-gene associations. In the extreme, it is even possible that all of these genes are occupied by independent ATPase and 20 S complexes and that the 26 S proteasome does not associate with the yeast genome. On the other hand, there is a scenario in which the data do not demand the existence of independent 20 S core-gene associations. In this view, one might imagine that when the proteasomal ATPases are engaged directly with the gene, they cross-link well (9Gillette T.G. Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5904-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Ferdous A. Gonzalez F. Sun L. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), but if the entire 26 S proteasome is associated with the gene, the 20 S proteins might cross-link efficiently, whereas the 19 S ATPases might not. Finally these two models are not mutually exclusive. To address these alternative models, we carried out focused ChIP assays in a sug1-20 strain (29Xu Q. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6025-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which carries a highly temperature-sensitive form of this protein (12Ferdous A. Gonzalez F. Sun L. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if coincident 20 S core and 19 S ATPase occupancy truly reflects the presence of the 26 S proteasome on a gene, then the ChIP signals for Pre1 and Sug2, as well as for Sug1, should be lost upon shifting to the non-permissive temperature. However, if these signals represent independent association of a 20 S complex and an ATPase complex, then unfolding of the temperature-labile Sug1-20 protein should abolish the Sug1 and Sug2 ChIP signals but not the 20 S core signal. The results are shown in Fig. 3. We examined genes that are co-occupied by both the 19 S ATPases and the 20 S core complex as well as genes that reveal little or no Sug1 and Sug2 occupancy but show a robust ChIP signal for the 20 S core particle. As expected, inactivation of the Sug1-20 protein at the restrictive temperature abolished the association of Sug1-20 protein and the Sug2 protein with most of the genes examined (Fig. 3, A and B). It is curious, however, that strong signals for Sug1-20 and Sug2 occupancy remained on the GAL4 and GAL80 genes and that a weak signal remained on GAL6.Wedo not understand the molecular basis of this observation, but it suggests the existence of Sug-containing complexes in some sort of special environment that stabilizes the temperature-sensitive protein. The signals due to 20 S-gene association responded to Sug1-20 protein inactivation in a different manner than did those due to Sug2 association. Although the intensity corresponding to all the 20 S core signals were lower at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 3C) the drop was much more dramatic at some genes than others. For example, a robust signal representing 20 S core association with the ARN1 gene was observed in the sug1-20 strain at 25 °C. This signal was diminished somewhat (Fig. 3C) but remained easily detectable at the non-permissive temperature (Fig. 3A). Along with the lack of any observable Sug1 or Sug2 association, this strongly suggests that the 20 S core ChIP signal on the 3′-end of ARN1 indeed represents, at least in part, a 19 S-independent 20 S complex-gene association. Like ARN1, GAL5 and GAL7 showed, at most, weak Sug1 and Sug2 association but strong 20 S core association at the permissive temperature (Fig. 3). In stark contrast, however, association of 20 S particle with these genes proved to be highly Sug1-dependent. Shifting to the non-permissive temperature in the sug1-20 strain resulted in the loss of most (GAL5) or essentially all (GAL7) of the detectable gene-20 S complex association. Thus, these data cannot be explained by a 19 S complex-independent association of 20 S core with these genes despite the weak or non-existent ChIP signals for Sug1 and Sug2 on these genes. We suggest that the simplest explanation is that these genes are associated with the full 26 S proteasome, but as suggested above, the geometry of this interaction is such that the 20 S proteins cross-link to the DNA (directly or indirectly) efficiently, but the Sug proteins do not. An alternative possibility is that the epitopes recognized by the Sug1 and Sug2 antibodies are not exposed in these particular cross-linked products, although this seems less likely because polyclonal antibodies were used in the ChIP assays. A third class of genes is represented by GAL1, GAL10, and GCY1. At the permissive temperature, these were associated with both the ATPases (with GAL1 and GAL10 showing exceptionally strong signals) and the 20 S complex at 25 °C. Upon shifting the temperature to 37 °C, all of these signals were lost. This is consistent with the 20 S core signal being due largely to association of the full 26 S proteasome with these genes. The Sug-gene associations could be due to the same 26 S proteasome-gene association, but we tend to favor the model in which these genes are associated both with the 26 S proteasome and, additionally, a 20 S core-independent ATPase complex and that (as discussed immediately above) the Sug protein-DNA associations are not detected readily in the context of the 26 S proteasome. Finally the association of the proteasomal proteins with the GAL4 and GAL80 genes merit mention. As stated above, these loci are unusual in that only a modest percentage of the Sug1-gene and Sug2-gene association was lost upon shifting the sug1-20 strain to the non-permissive temperature (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, however, the 20 S-GAL4 and 20 S-GAL80 signals, which were also prominent at 25 °C, were abolished at 37 °C, showing clear dependence on functional Sug1-20. We suggest that the simplest explanation for this result is co-habitation of the GAL4 and GAL80 genes by the 26 S proteasome, whose association is sensitive to"

Site-specific phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol head group at distinct subcellular locations is an important cellular mechanism for targeting cytosolic proteins to specific membrane subdomains and is a crucial aspect of multiple signal transduction and vesicular transport pathways (1Roth M.G. . 2004; 84: 699-730Google Scholar). PI 3-kinases are involved in the regulation of a broad range of processes including mitosis, cytoskeletal organization, apoptosis, and membrane trafficking (2Foster F.M. Traer C.J. Abraham S.M.

Class I enzymes phosphorylate PI 4-phosphate and PI 4,5-bisphosphate and are signaling PI 3-kinases acting primarily at the plasma membrane and activated, for example, by tyrosine phosphorylation following mitogenic stimulation or by heterotrimeric G-protein signaling (4Auger K.R.

Class II kinases are less well studied but have similar substrate specificity to class I enzymes and are also involved in signaling. Class II kinases may additionally function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (6Brown R.A. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Gaidarov I.

Class III PI 3-kinases are all related to the yeast vacuolar sorting protein Vps34p and, unlike the class I and II enzymes, appear to be universal across eukaryotic evolution (2Foster F.M. Traer C.J.

Class III PI 3-kinases mediate phosphorylation of PI to produce PI (3)P and have an evolutionarily conserved role in late endosomal transport. Yeast Vps34p regulates transport to the vacuole, whereas the human class III PI 3-kinase, hVPS34, is required for multivesicular body morphogenesis and for transport of lysosomal proteins (9Herman P.K.

Class III PI 3-kinases have been implicated in a variety of processes, one of the best understood being their role as downstream effectors of the small GTPase, Rab5, in endosomal membrane fusion. The main site of PI (3)P production is at the endosomal membrane in mammalian cells, but high levels are also found in the lumen of the yeast vacuole (12Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Yeast Vps34p exists in a complex with a myristoylated, WD40 domain-containing protein kinase, Vps15p (13Stack J.H. Herman P.K. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologue of Vps15p, adaptor protein p150, binds to the active, GTP-bound form of Rab5, targeting both protein and PI 3-kinase to early endosomes and leading to the Rab5-dependent generation of PI (3)P on endosomal membranes (14Christoforidis S.

Endosomal fusion in turn is promoted by the recruitment of the tethering factor EEA1, which binds to PI (3)P via a FYVE (FAB1-YOTB-Vac1-EEA1) domain (15Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A.

EEA1 also interacts with numerous factors on both donor and acceptor membranes including Rab5 and syntaxins 6 and 13, allowing formation of oligomeric complexes that drive membrane fusion (17McBride H.M.

A similar process governs endosomal fusion in yeast, with Vac1p and Ypt31p taking the places of EEA1 and Rab5, respectively (19Peterson M.R. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Curr.

Class III PI 3-kinases are not only required for vacuolar transport in yeast and multivesicular body formation in mammals but have also been implicated in the processes of retrograde endosome to trans-Golgi network (TGN) trafficking, via direct binding to retromer, and in autophagy (3Rog O.

The flagellated protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei has one of the better understood endomembrane systems among the highly divergent eukaryotes (23Berriman M. Ghedin E. Hertz-Fowler C. Blandin G.

Hall B.S. Denny P.W. Carrington M. Field M.C. Trends Parasitol. 2002; 18: 491-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The parasite is highly polarized, with all uptake and secretion restricted to an invagination at the base of the flagellum termed the flagellar pocket. Studies of VSG turnover have revealed an efficient recycling system in which all of the surface protein, receptor-bound, and fluid phase cargo are endocytosed via clathrin-coated vesicles and then sorted in a tubular endosome with the bulk of the VSG returning rapidly to the surface (25Grunfelder C.G.

T. brucei expresses two Rab5 GTPases, TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B, which are associated with distinct cargos (27Pal A. Hall B.S. Nesbeth D.N. Field H.L. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9529-9539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although these two proteins appear to have subtly distinct functions, both are essential for survival and are required for maintenance of endocytic function (28Hall B.S. Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 138: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). No downstream effectors have been identified for either TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B, and their mechanisms of action are unknown. The presence of at least 12 FYVE domain proteins in the T. brucei genome, all with orthologues in other kinetoplastid genomes, suggests that PI (3)P production is important in the regulation of cellular functions in trypanosomatids. Here we describe the identification and functional analysis of TbVps34, the trypanosome orthologue of Vsp34; in particular we uncovered an unexpected role for TbVps34 in segregation of the Golgi apparatus at cytokinesis. Bioinformatics—TbVps34 was identified by BLAST analysis by screening human and yeast PI 3-kinase protein sequences against the T. brucei data bases at GeneDB (www.genedb.org) and the TIGR T. brucei genome project (www.tigr.org.tdb/mdb/tdb/). Orthology was confirmed by reverse BLAST. Alignments and phylogenetic analysis were performed between TbVps34 and Vps34-related sequences from NCBI and GeneDB using ClustalW. Cell Lines and Culture—The tetracycline-inducible trypanosome cell line BSF 90-13 was routinely cultured in HMI-9 medium supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (Autogen Bioclear). To maintain the tetracycline responsive phenotype cells were grown in the continuous presence of 5 μg/ml hygromycin B and 2.5 μg/ml geneticin (both from Sigma). The cells were maintained at concentrations between 1 × 104 and 2 × 106 ml-1. For growth curves, triplicate cultures were initiated at 1 × 105 ml-1 with or without tetracycline at a concentration of 1 μg ml-1. Cell concentration was determined using a Z2 Coulter counter (Beckman). Plasmids and Transfection—A fragment of the TbVps34 sequence selected and verified by RNAit (29Redmond S. Vadivelu J. Field M.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with the primers CGGGATCCGGTTGCTGTTCAAAGTGGGT and GGAAGCTTGTGCCTCCACCATTTCCTTA and cloned into BamHI/HindIII-digested p2T72Ti (gift of Doug LeCount). Tetracycline-responsive BSF 90-13 cells were transfected with NotI-digested p2T72Ti·TbVps34 by electroporation, incubated for 6 h, and then selected for 1 week with 2.5 μg ml-1 phleomycin. The cells were maintained thereafter in the presence of phleomycin. RNAi was induced by incubation with 1 μg ml-1 tetracycline. GFP2xFYVE excised from pEGFP2xFYVE (gift from Harald Stenmark) was inserted into pHD1034 (gift of Christine Clayton) via HindIII/BamHI sites. pHD1034·RFP-GRASP was derived from pXS5·RFP-GRASP (originally a gift from Graham Warren). pHD1034 constructs were digested with NotI and transfected into p2T72TI·TbVps34 cells by electroporation. The cells were incubated for 6 h, then puromycin (0.1 μg ml-1) was added, and the cells were selected for 1 week. Immunofluorescence—For p67 immunofluorescence, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, adhered to poly-l-lysine slides (Sigma), and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The slides were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS. For staining of p67, the slides were incubated in monoclonal antibody 280 (gift of Jay Bangs) diluted in blocking buffer containing 0.02% sodium azide for 1 h at room temperature. For basal body and paraflagellar rod staining, the cells were air dried onto slides and fixed in methanol at -20 °C. The slides were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS and then incubated for 1 h with BBA4 or PFR-A monoclonal antibody in PBS/BSA (gift of Keith Gull). After washing with PBS, the slides were incubated with Oregon Green- or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). The cells were examined under a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope, and images were captured using a Photometrix Coolsnap FX camera and prepared with Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Fluid Phase Uptake—Fluid phase uptake was monitored using Alexa Fluor 488 dextran 10000 (Molecular Probes) as described (30Hall B.S. Smith E. Langer W. Jacobs L.A. Goulding D. Field M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNAi was induced by incubation for 18 h with 1 μg ml-1 tetracycline, and the cells were harvested and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 108 cells ml-1 in 50 μl of fresh medium. Labeled dextran was added to a concentration of 5 mg ml-1, and the cells were incubated for various times at 37 °C. Uptake was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold HMI9 medium, and the cells were washed once at 4 °C before fixing for 1 h at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were adhered to slides, mounted, and examined immediately. The images were captured as described above. For quantitation, the images were taken under nonsaturating conditions using identical exposure times. Fluorescence intensity was determined using Metamorph Imaging software. Transferrin Uptake—Uptake of FITC-transferrin (Molecular Probes) was performed as described (28Hall B.S. Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 138: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). RNAi was induced for 18 h, and the cells were harvested and washed once in serum-free HMI9 medium containing 1% BSA. The cells were resuspended in HMI9/BSA at a concentration of 1 × 107 ml-1 and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. FITC-transferrin (100 μg ml-1) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times. Uptake was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold HMI9 medium, and the cells were washed once at 4 °C before fixing for 1 h at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were adhered to slides, mounted, and examined immediately. The images were captured and fluorescence intensity was quantified as described above. Uptake of Concanavalin A—The cells were harvested and washed once in serum-free HMI9 medium containing 1% BSA. The cells were resuspended in HMI9/BSA at a concentration of 1 × 107 ml-1 and incubated at 4 °C or 37 °C for 20 min. Biotin or FITC-conjugated ConA (100 μg ml-1) (Vectalabs) was added, and the cells were incubated for a further 30 min. Uptake was stopped by placing the cells on ice. The labeled cells were washed in HMI9/BSA at 4 °C, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and adhered to slides as described above. For p67 co-localization, the cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100. For GPF2xFYVE co-localization, the cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin. The slides were blocked as described, and biotinylated ConA was detected by incubating for 1 h at room temperature with Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin (Vectalabs). The slides were either mounted immediately or counterstained with antibody as described. Wortmannin Treatment—Cells expressing the GFP2xFYVE construct were incubated in liquid culture with wortmannin at a range of concentrations and times of exposure (0.01-30 μm and 30-120 min), and the location of the GFP construct was assessed after preparation for immunofluorescence as described above. Wortmannin stock was freshly prepared by dissolving the solid in dry Me2SO. Electron Microscopy—For transmission electron microscopy, the cells were fixed in suspension by adding chilled 5% glutaraldehyde (TAAB) and 8% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS in a 1:1 ratio to the growth medium containing trypanosomes. The cells were fixed on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min in 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and the supernatant was carefully replaced with fresh fixative for a further 50 min without disturbing the pellet, rinsed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (TAAB) in same buffer at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing in buffer, the cells were then dehydrated in an ethanol series, adding 1% uranyl acetate at the 30% stage, followed by propylene oxide, then embedded in Epon/Araldite 502 (TAAB), and finally polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. Sections were cut on a Leica Ultracut T ultramicrotome at 70 nm using a diamond knife, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined on a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. VSG Exocytosis—Export was monitored as described (31Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4991-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 107 mid-log phase BSF cells were washed once in labeling medium (Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and Hepes, pH 7.4), resuspended in 1 ml of labeling medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were pulse labeled at 37 °C for 7 min with Promix at a concentration of 200 μCi ml-1, then diluted 1:10 with prewarmed complete HMI9, and chased for up to 1 h at 37°C. At intervals during the chase, aliquots of cells were removed from the sample and placed on ice. Following centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (20,000 × g at 4 °C), cell pellets were washed once in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS/1 mg ml-1 BSA and resuspended in 920 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer. After 5 min on ice, the lysates were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to enable GPI-specific phospholipase C to convert susceptible membrane form VSG to soluble VSG. The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C, and 900 μl of supernatant was retained. The pellet fraction was washed in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer, then resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold sample lysis buffer, and incubated on ice for 25 min. 90 μl of 10× sample lysis buffer and 10 μl of Nonidet P-40 was added to the supernatant fraction to bring the buffers to equivalence. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min (20,000 × g, 4 °C). Labeled VSG was recovered from the supernatants by incubation for 1 h at 4°C with ConA-Sepharose 4B in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2. After washing, the samples were resuspended in sample buffer and loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels at 1 × 105 cell equivalents/lane. Fixed, stained gels were treated for 1 h with EnH3ance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and autoradiographed. Image intensity was quantified using imageJ software. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—The Cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 1 μg ml-1 tetracycline then 5 × 107 cells were harvested and washed once in PBS. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), precipitated with isopropanol, ethanol-washed, resuspended in diethyl cyanophosphonate-treated water, and stored at a concentration of 0.5-1 mg ml-1 at -80 °C. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Titan One-Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Applied Science) (32Marone M. Mozzetti S. De Ritis D. Pierelli L. Scambia G. Biol. Proced. Online. 2001; 3: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). TbVps34 message was detected using the primers AAACGAATGGAACTTGCCAC (forward) and CATAGCCGCTGTGTATCCCT (reverse), designed to amplify a segment of the TbVps34 gene distinct from the fragment used for RNAi. As a control, primers specific for α-tubulin, CAGAGAAGGCCTACCACGAG (forward) and CTCTTCCATACCCTGACCGA (reverse) were used. Assays for TbVps34 contained 400 ng of RNA, and those for α-tubulin contained 100 ng of RNA. For the reverse transcription step, the samples were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min and then at 94 °C for 2 min. For amplification, the samples were incubated at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles followed by a 7-min extension at 68 °C. Cycling conditions were optimized to ensure concentration dependence of amplification, and the absence of contaminating genomic DNA was confirmed by omission of the reverse transcription step (not shown). Similar results were obtained in duplicate experiments. Yeast Complementation—The full-length TbVPS34 ORF was amplified by PCR with the following primers: forward TATTGAATTCATGGCCACGAACGAGGAC and reverse TATACTCGAGTGTGAGCCTTTAGGC, and inserted into EcoRI and XhoI sites in the pYES2Ct expression vector polylinker (2μ, URA3; Invitrogen). The yeast Vps34 knockout strain, SEY6210 Δvps34::TRP1 was transformed with empty vector pYES2Ct or pYES2CtTbVPS34. Yeast Vps34 PI 3-kinase complementation by TbVPS34 was confirmed by spotting serial dilutions of yeast cells, initially calibrated by optical density, carrying empty pYES2Ct vector or pYES2CtTbVPS34 on synthetic selective media plates (DO-TRP/URA). The plates were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C. TbVps34 Is a Class III PI 3-Kinase—The T. brucei genome data base GeneDB contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding proteins with predicted phosphatidylinositol kinase domains (see supplemental Table S1). Of these, eight show some level of homology to PI 3-kinases. However, the presence of FRAP, ATM, TRAPP/FRAP, ATM, TRRAP, C-terminal domain (FAT/FATC) accessory domains places six of these in the category of the target of rapamycin (TOR)-related atypical protein kinases, a family of protein kinases with lipid kinase-like catalytic domains that lack demonstrable ability to phosphorylate lipid substrates. Membership of this distinct subgroup is confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of the aligned proteins (supplemental Fig. S1A). Of the remaining two ORFs with a PI 3-kinase-like domain, one (Tb11.01.6980, accession number EAN80479) is an unusual kinase with a catalytic domain most similar to a PI 3-kinase combined with a PI (3)P-binding FYVE domain and a putative transmembrane sequence. However, the degree of conservation is relatively weak, sharing only 18% identity with mammalian PI 3-kinases in the kinase domain. Alignment suggests a closer homology to the atypical protein kinases than to genuine PI kinases (supplemental Fig. S1A). Therefore, this protein cannot be assigned with confidence to any particular PI kinase subfamily. Based on comparison of sequences, it seems likely that T. brucei, like yeast, possesses only one genuine PI 3-kinase, Tb927.8.6210 (accession number AAX69336), present as a single copy on chromosome eight. The Tb927.8.6210 gene encodes a 949-amino acid protein with a very high level of homology to Vps34 by BLAST analysis against the nonredundant data base (p = 1.5e-87) (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Orthology was confirmed by reverse BLAST against Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequences. The TbVps34 protein sequence shares the Class III PI 3-kinase domain structure, with an N-terminal C2 domain (residues 109-252), an accessory domain (residues 357-547), and a C-terminal kinase domain (residues 694-891) (Fig. 1A). The catalytic domain shares 43% identity and 63% similarity with the human Vps34 homologue, but only 32% identity and 51% similarity with human Class II PI 3-kinase and 29% identity and 49% similarity with the Class I PI 3-kinase α-chain. In particular, the activation loop sequence between residues 826 and 836 of TbVps34, which confers substrate specificity, indicates a Class III enzyme (33Pirola L. Zvelebil M.J. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Van Obberghen E. Waterfield M.D. Wymann M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Further, a critical lysine residue within the active site (Lys720 in Tb927.8.6210 in supplemental Fig. S1B) that is essential for kinase activity and is covalently modified by wortmannin in mammalian PI 3-kinases is also conserved. Likewise the accessory and C2 domains are characteristic of Class III PI 3-kinases. The gene encoding the next closest homologue in T. brucei, Tb927.4.1140, lacks any obvious accessory domains, only shares a 30% identity with the hVPS34 kinase domain, and is more similar to a PI 4-kinase than a PI 3-kinase. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the T. brucei PI 3-kinase forms part of a protist-specific clade of Vps34-like genes from other kinetoplastid parasites (Fig. 1B) and indicates that the Vps34 family is present throughout the eukaryotes. Further, the major binding partner of Vps34p, Vps15p (or p150 in metazoa), which is required for function, can also be recovered from the T. brucei genome (Tb11.01.0930, accession number XM823891) and is orthologous to S. cerevisiae Vps15 by reverse BLAST (data not shown). Based on the sequence data, Tb927.8.6210 is most likely to be a lipid kinase that phosphorylates PI at position 3 to produce PI (3)P and to function in vesicle trafficking rather than signal transduction, and we propose that the product of Tb927.8.6210 be called TbVps34p.

Here we used Hoxc13-overexpressing transgenic mice (also known as GC13 mice), known to develop severe hair growth defects and alopecia, as a tool for defining pathways of hair follicle differentiation. Gene array analysis performed with RNA from postnatal skin revealed differential expression of distinct subsets of genes specific for cells of the three major hair shaft compartments (cuticle, cortex, and medulla) and their precursors. This finding correlates well with the structural defects observed in each of these compartments and implicates Hoxc13 in diverse pathways of hair follicle differentiation. The group of medulla-specific genes was particularly intriguing because this included the developmentally regulated transcription factor-encoding gene Foxq1 that is altered in the medulladefective satin mouse hair mutant. We provide evidence that Foxq1 is a downstream target for Hoxc13 based on DNA binding studies as well as co-transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Expression of additional medulla-specific genes down-regulated upon overexpression of Hoxc13 requires functional Foxq1 as their expression is ablated in hair follicles of satin mice. Combined, these results demonstrate that Hoxc13 and Foxq1 control medulla differentiation through a common regulatory pathway. The apparent regulatory interactions between members of the mammalian Hox and Fox gene families shown here may establish a paradigm for “cross-talk” between these two conserved regulatory gene families in different developmental contexts including embryonic patterning as well as organ development and renewal.

Recent progress in defining the molecular framework underlying normal and pathological development of skin and hair increasingly implicates the Hox family of transcriptional controller genes as key regulatory molecules (1Awgulewitsch A. Naturwissenschaften. 2003; 90: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The hair follicle is of particular interest because both morphogenesis and cyclical renewal of this complex miniature organ employ many of the same genetic control mechanisms as required for embryonic patterning (2Oro A.E. Scott M.P. Cell. 1998; 95: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 3Schmidt-Ullrich R. Paus R. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Follicular morphogenesis is initiated during embryonic development and progresses in successive rostrocaudal waves across the epithelium (4Mann S.J. Anat. Rec. 1962; 144: 135-142Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), thus resulting in a fixed number of follicles at various stages of differentiation at birth (5Stenn K. Weiss L. Cell and Tissue Biology: A Textbook of Histology. Urban and Schwarzenberg, Baltimore-Munich1988: 541-572Google Scholar). Furthermore, hair follicles and fibers display a great degree of regionally specified morphological heterogeneity defining hair follicle type (6Sundberg J.P. Hogan M.E. Sundberg J.P. Handbook of Mouse Mutations with Skin and Hair Abnormalities. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 57-68Google Scholar), and there exists additional variation among follicles of the same type so that probably no two follicles of an individual are identical (7Stenn K.S. Combates N.J. Eilertsen K.J. Gordon J.S. Pardinas J.R. Parimoo S. Prouty S.M. Dermatol. Clin. 1996; 14: 543-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In keeping with the role of the Hox gene system to define regional identities along the anteriorposterior axis during axial and paraxial patterning including limb development (8McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar, 9Duboule D. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 10Capecchi M.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1997; 62: 273-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been proposed that this system might be employed to establish territorial specificity of the skin and its appendages (11Chuong C.M. Oliver G. Ting S.A. Jegalian B.G. Chen H.M. De Robertis E.M. Development. 1990; 110: 1021-1030PubMed Google Scholar). This concept is supported by the observation of distinct anterior-posterior expression domains for various Hox genes in developing skin as well as hair and feather follicles (11Chuong C.M. Oliver G. Ting S.A. Jegalian B.G. Chen H.M. De Robertis E.M. Development. 1990; 110: 1021-1030PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bieberich C.J. Ruddle F.H. Stenn K.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In parallel to this regionally restricted expression, certain members of the Hox family apparently are distinctly expressed in all follicles, as it applies to Hoxc13 (17Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and probably several other members of this gene family (1Awgulewitsch A. Naturwissenschaften. 2003; 90: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This universal follicular expression suggests essential functional roles during follicle morphogenesis and/or cycling. Support for this concept was provided by the lack of hair in Hoxc13 gene-targeted mice (17Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and the delayed hair growth and subsequent loss of hair in Hoxc13-overexpressing transgenic mice (Tg(Hoxc13)61B1Awg, MGI: 3574566, also referred to as GC13 mice (18Tkatchenko A.V. Visconti R.P. Shang L. Papenbrock T. Pruett N.D. Ito T. Ogawa M. Awgulewitsch A. Development. 2001; 128: 1547-1558PubMed Google Scholar)), essentially affecting all body regions in both cases. In the progressive growth phase, anagen, the Hoxc13 expression pattern in the hair follicle bulb, originates in a conspicuous region of the matrix above the proliferative cell compartment (see Fig. 1 (18Tkatchenko A.V.

Development. 2005; 132: 4143-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This finding combined with the distinctly layered expression patterns of specific hair keratins in the matrix of human hair follicles suggest a high level of organization in the matrix where the compartment-specific lineages originate at distinct proximo-distal levels (19Langbein L. Schweizer J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 243: 1-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Legué E. Nicolas J.F. Development. 2005; 132: 4143-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). According to this model, Hoxc13 expression in the upper internal ORS is consistent with a potential role in determining the fate of presumptive progenitors to differentiate along medulla and cortex-specific pathways (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, the continued expression of both mouse Hoxc13 and its human ortholog in differentiating cells of the medulla, cortex, cuticle of the hair shaft, and inner root sheath (IRS), and the companion layer overlaps well with the compartment-specific patterns of various hair keratin genes and suggests a role in their regulation (17Godwin A.R.

C and D, Hoxc13 and Foxq1 expression patterns in hair of Foxq1sa/Foxq1sa (satin) mice. The loss of properly differentiated medulla structures in the mid to upper regions is accompanied by a loss of expression of the Foxq1sa allele (D) but apparently not of Hoxc13 expression (C) in the central regions of these hairs; both genes continue to be expressed in the pre-medulla region (red arrows) capping the dermal papilla (DP); the pigmented satin hair has brownish-colored melanin granules (gray arrows) absent in albino FVB hair.

The remarkable overlap of the Hoxc13 expression pattern with matrix-specific activity domains of several signaling molecules and transcription factors, including Wnt5a, Catnb, Bmp4, Fgf5, Tcf/Lef1, Foxn1, Foxq1, and Msx2 (for review, see Ref. 23Fuchs E. Merrill B.J. Jamora C. DasGupta R. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) supports the idea of Hoxc13 being engaged in both mechanisms. To address this question we determined the differential gene expression profile in postnatal skin of GC13 mice by DNA microarray analysis. 4DNA microarray data used for this study is archived in the Gene Expression Omnibus as a series under the accession number GSE2374. Sample and experimental DNA microarray information compliant with Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment guidelines is reported in the supplemental material. 4DNA microarray data used for this study is archived in the Gene Expression Omnibus as a series under the accession number GSE2374. Sample and experimental DNA microarray information compliant with Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment guidelines is reported in the supplemental material. The results identified genes of different functional categories as potential downstream targets for Hoxc13 in distinct follicular compartments. Genes specifically expressed in the medulla formed the largest subgroup, including Foxq1 as the most conspicuous member of this group. Foxq1sa is the mutated allele underlying the satin hair phenotype (24Hong H.K. Noveroske J.K. Headon D.J. Liu T. Sy M.S. Justice M.J. Chakravarti A. Genesis. 2001; 29: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), a mouse mutation with a defect in the hair follicle medulla. Our data demonstrate that Foxq1 is a downstream target for Hoxc13 during medulla differentiation, thus demonstrating a functional link in mammals between two conserved families of regulatory genes essential for embryonic patterning and organ development. Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy (TEM and SEM)—Dorsal skin from two severely affected GC13 transgenic mice and from two age -and gender-matched FVB/NTac controls was removed after euthanasia by CO2 asphyxiation using Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved methods and cut into 1-mm strips in rostro-caudal orientation. Samples were fixed overnight in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, at 4 °C and transferred into PBS for overnight shipment. Upon receipt tissues were post-fixed overnight in 1% osmium tetroxide, PBS and processed for embedding, sectioning and TEM analysis as described in detail (25Bechtold L.S. Sundberg J.P. Boggess D. Systematic Characterization of Mouse Mutations. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2000: 121-129Google Scholar). For SEM, parallel skin samples of about 1 cm2 taken from the same animals were processed and analyzed essentially as described (25Bechtold L.S. Sundberg J.P. Boggess D. Systematic Characterization of Mouse Mutations. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2000: 121-129Google Scholar). Gene Array Analysis—Total RNA (10 μg) from post-partum day (PPD) 5 normal and GC13 skin of the trunk was converted into biotinylated, fragmented cRNA according to the Affymetrix protocol. Purification of biotinylated cRNA, hybridization in triplicate to MG-U74Av2 GeneChips (Affymetrix, San Diego, CA) containing probes for interrogating ∼12,500 presumptive genes, and normalization of hybridization data were performed as previously described (26Peterson R.L.

Differential expression was scored by the following inclusion criteria; (i) genes had to be identified as “present” by GeneChip® MAS 5.0 software in at least 2 of the 3 replicate arrays, (ii) p ≤ 0.01 for the t test (unpaired, 2-tailed, assuming unequal variance), and (iii) changes in average intensity values of ≥2-fold.

Real-time Quantitative (Q)-PCR—Total RNA from PPD 5 normal and GC13 skin was isolated by a CsCl step gradient, and polyadenylated RNA was extracted using the GenElute mRNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma). Complete cDNA was synthesized using a Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). For standardization, cDNA samples were quantified using a PicoGreen dsDNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Q-PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system using ABI Sybr Green PCR mixture and 20 μm primers exactly as described by the manufacturer. Standard primers for β2-microglobulin were used as controls and for normalization.

Sequences of sense strand oligos corresponding to the three most proximal putative binding sites upstream of Foxq1 (see Fig. 7) that started at nucleotide positions -2149 and -2188 on the non-coding strand and at position -2411 on the coding strand with respect to the Foxq1 translational start site (32Frank S. Zoll B. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were 5′-(GGG)TAAGGACACCTTCATTAACAACAATGTCTTT-3′ (oligo 2149), 5′-(GGG)AATGTATCTCCTCCATAAAACAGGCACGC-3′ (oligo 2188), and 5′-(GGG)CAACAGTCAGCTTAATAGG- GACGAGGAATA-3′ (oligo 2411); a mutated version of oligo 2411 (oligo 2411(M)) contained a change in the consensus binding sequence (5′-TTAATAGG-3′ → 5′-TGCCGAGG-3′). Annealed and labeled oligos were incubated with Hoxc13 protein synthesized using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). For this purpose, a full-length Hoxc13 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) and into a modified version of this vector (pcDNA3.1his) containing a Kozak (33Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) consensus translational start site and a polyhistidine (his) tag, thus resulting in expression vectors pHoxc13 and pHoxc13-his. Deletion of the homeodomain (hd) in pHoxc13-his by using EcoN1 and XhoI resulted in pHoxc13Δhd-his. A TNT reaction with a luciferase expression plasmid was used as a negative control. Binding reactions and gel electrophoresis were performed exactly as previously described (34Norris R.A. Kern M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26829-26837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For supershift assays, 1 μl of HOXC13-specific antiserum (21Jave-Suarez L.F. Winter H. Langbein L.

Transient Co-transfection Assays—For transient co-transfection assays using 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line, cells were treated and transfected as previously described (34Norris R.A. Kern M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26829-26837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The reporter gene plasmid contained 9.1 kb of the Foxq1 promoter region in the pGL2-Basic Vector (Promega). Deletions of this promoter fragment were generated by digestion with MluI and Bst1107I and MluI and EagI, respectively (see Fig. 8A). Hoxc13 expression vectors used were pHoxc13, pHoxc13-his, and pHoxc13Δhd-his as described above. Each dish of 3T3 cells was transfected with 0.5 and 0.3 μg of reporter and expression vector, respectively, in addition to 0.2 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector. C2C12 cells were transfected with double the amount of each plasmid. An enhanced green fluorescent protein expression plasmid was used to substitute for the expression plasmid as a negative control. Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested, luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed, and values were normalized as previously described (34Norris R.A. Kern M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26829-26837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Each transfection was performed in triplicate with at least three independent experiments. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed using methods from Ren and Dynlacht (35Ren B. Dynlacht B.D. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. C2C12 mouse myoblast cells were plated at a density 3 × 105 in 100-mm plates. After 48 h cells were transfected with a Hoxc13 expression vector where the Hoxc13 coding sequence was fused to a FLAG epitope at the amino terminus. After an additional 24 h cells were resuspended using trypsin/EDTA (Sigma) and cross-linked using formaldehyde solution. Glycine (2.5 m) was added to stop the cross-linking reaction. Cells were lysed to extract chromatin and sonicated to generate DNA fragments of ∼500 bp. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged protein-DNA complexes was achieved by incubating the lysate overnight at 4 °C with EZview Red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). After 2 washes with PBS the FLAG-tagged complexes were eluted with 2.5 m glycine, pH 3.5. Cross-links were reversed with 1% SDS, and protein was digested with proteinase K. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. Precipitated Foxq1 DNA was detected by PCR using Foxq1-specific primer sets A and B (A-fwd, 5′-TCCTCCATCCTCCTCTCCTC, A-rev, 5′-ACTTCATCCGTCACCACCTC; B-fwd, 5′-GGCCTGGAATCTCCCTATTG; B-rev, 5′-AATTAGCCCAGTGCAAGGTG). Primer sets specific for Prx1 (5′-CCTGAGTTACCTGCACTCTG; 5′-AGGACTGAGGAGGATTCTTG) and Smad6 (5′-GCAGCGTGGCGTACTGGGAGCA; 5′-GAG-TAACCCGGTGGCACCTTG) genomic regions not containing Hoxc13 consensus binding sequences were used as controls. Annealing for all primers was at 60 °C using standard conditions.

The active domain of ICP47 was reconstituted into oriented phospholipid bilayers and studied by proton-decoupled 15N and 2H solid-state NMR spectroscopy. In phospholipid bilayers, the protein adopts a helix-loop-helix structure, where the average tilt angle of the helices relative to the membrane surface is ∼15° (±7°). The alignment of both structured domains exhibits a mosaic spread of ∼10°. A flexible dynamic loop encompassing residues 17 and 18 separates the two helices. Refinement of the experimental data indicates that helix 1 inserts more deeply into the membrane.

In the absence of a functional TAP transporter (within 3 h of infection with herpes simplex virus), peptide loading onto MHC class I molecules is inhibited, and as a consequence, empty MHC I molecules are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and ultimately directed to proteasomal degradation. By binding with nanomolar affinity to the heterodimeric TAP complex, ICP47 blocks peptide binding but not ATP binding to the ATP-binding cassette transporter (12Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. Sempe P.

Andrews D.W. Johnson D.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3256-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Functional studies with N- and C-terminally truncated variants of ICP47 demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of ICP47 is sufficient for TAP inhibition (residues 1–53 (16Beinert D. Neumann L. Uebel S. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4694-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), 2–35 (17Galocha B. Hill A. Barnett B.C. Dolan A. Raimondi A. Cook R.F. Brunner J. McGeoch D.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and 3–34 (18Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)). Moreover, by alanine scanning mutagenesis, three regions (residues 8–12, 17–24, and 28–31) were identified within the active domain of ICP47, which are critical for TAP inhibition (17Galocha B. Hill A. Barnett B.C. Dolan A. Raimondi A. Cook R.F. Brunner J. McGeoch D.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The active domain of ICP47 (residues 3–34) displays an identical ability to inhibit TAP function when compared with the full-length protein, illustrating preservation of the functional properties (18Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The secondary structure and membrane association of ICP47 have been analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and tryptophan fluorescence quenching (16Beinert D. Neumann L. Uebel S. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4694-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Both, full-length ICP47 as well as the active domain are mainly unstructured in aqueous solution independent of the protein concentration or pH value (16Beinert D. Neumann L. Uebel S. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4694-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which is in accordance with the observation that purification in organic solvent or heating to 100 °C has no effect on its ability to inhibit TAP (15Tomazin R. Hill A.B. Jugovic P. York I. van Endert P. Ploegh H.L. Andrews D.W. Johnson D.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3256-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 18Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, after binding to phospholipid membranes, a transition to helical conformations is induced in the active domain as well as in the full-length protein, confirming a tight membrane interaction (16Beinert D. Neumann L. Uebel S. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4694-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Multi-dimensional solution NMR spectroscopy indicates that the active domain of ICP47 adopts a helix-loop-helix conformation in the presence of detergent micelles, where helix 1 comprises residues 4–15 and helix 2 residues 22–32. However, it should be noted that considerable differences have been observed in the past when the structural details of polypeptides obtained in the presence of detergents or when associated with bilayers are compared with each other. For example, the possibility exists that the helix-turn-helix structure observed in micelles is an artifact of the geometry and the high curvature of such environments. Furthermore, it would be of interest to know how the helical domains align relative to the bilayer surface. The answer to such questions can only be obtained by investigating the structure of ICP47 when associated with planar phospholipid bilayers. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is an emerging technique in the study of the structure and dynamics of membrane-associated proteins and peptides (19Bechinger B. Aisenbrey C. Bertani P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 190-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Davis J.H. Auger M. Progress in NMR Spectroscopy. 1999; 35: 1-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Luca S. Heise H. Baldus M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 858-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Watts A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although a priori NMR interactions strongly depend on the alignment of the molecules relative to the magnetic field direction, in isotropic solutions, fast rotational diffusion results in averaging, and therefore only the isotropic chemical shift values as well as direct spin-spin couplings are observed. In contrast, in static solid samples or in samples where averaging is anisotropic, the most pronounced features of the spectra can be attributed to this orientational dependence of NMR interactions. When uniaxially oriented samples are investigated by static solid-state NMR spectroscopy, advantage is taken of this orientation dependence of NMR interactions, which allows extraction of angular constraints for structural analysis. Proton-decoupled 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy has been shown to be particularly useful in providing detailed information on the helical tilt angles and therefore the topology of membrane-associated polypeptides in a direct manner (23Bechinger B. Sizun C. Concepts in Magnetic Resonance Part A. 2003; 18: 130-145Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the case of polypeptides that have been isotopically labeled with 15N at one of their amide bonds and reconstituted into bilayers oriented with their normal parallel to the magnetic field direction, 15N chemical shifts in the 200-ppm range are indicative of transmembrane helix alignments, whereas in-plane-oriented helices resonate at <100 ppm (24Aisenbrey C. Bechinger B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10502-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This is illustrated in the top panel of Fig. 2. Deuterium solid-state NMR spectroscopy provides complementary angular restraints, which in combination with the 15N chemical shift allow for the accurate determination of the tilt and azimuthal angles of membrane-associated helices (24Aisenbrey C. Bechinger B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10502-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The deuterium quadrupole splitting of alanines carrying three deuterons at the methyl group has been shown to be a very sensitive indicator of helix alignments, which permits the tracking of even small topological changes (24Aisenbrey C. Bechinger B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10502-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 2H NMR technique has recently been developed to monitor the mosaic spread of helix alignments and the rotational diffusion of membrane polypeptides (24Aisenbrey C. Bechinger B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10502-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Aisenbrey C. Bechinger B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16676-16683Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here 2H and proton-decoupled 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy have been combined to investigate in considerable detail the alignment, limits, and mosaic spread of the secondary structural elements of reconstituted ICP47 in oriented phospholipid bilayers. By positioning at strategic places eight different isotopic labels within the ICP47 sequence, it was not only possible to test for the existence of a helix-loop-helix conformation also in phospholipid bilayers, but even more important, the alignment of the helical domains relative to the membrane surface could be determined. Furthermore, a novel Edmundson helical wheel-based “energy minimization” strategy was developed for this study to select, among a number of topological states, the one that agrees with the oriented solid-state NMR data. The structural and topological information derived from these measurements provide detailed insights into the inhibition mechanism of ICP47. Peptide Transport Assays—Assays were performed with microsomes isolated from Raji cells (human Burkitt lymphoma). Microsomes (50 μg of total protein) were pre-incubated with 10 μm ICP47-(2–34) for 20 min on ice. After the addition of MgATP (3 mm) or apyrase (1 unit) and radiolabeled peptide (460 nm, RRYQNSTEL; N-core glycosylation-targeting site underlined), transport was performed for 2 min at 32 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer supplemented with 10 mm EDTA. After centrifugation, microsomes were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) for 20 min on ice. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation, and glycosylated peptides in the supernatant were bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose beads for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with lysis buffer, radioactivity associated with the beads was quantified by gamma counting (26Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Peptides were radiolabeled with Na125I as reported previously (27Chen M. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ICP47 Binding Assays—TAP-containing membranes or purified TAP were incubated with increasing concentrations of ICP47-(2–34) for 60 min at 4 °C in 50 μl of binding buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, pH 7.4) or binding buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 0.1% digitonin, pH 7.4), respectively. Radiolabeled peptide RR(125I)YQKSTEL was added to a final concentration of 200 nm and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Unbound peptides were removed by washing the membranes or purified protein with 200 μl of ice-cold binding buffers using a vacuum manifold with 96-well filter plates (MultiScreen, 1-μm glass fiber Type B filter, Millipore). The amount of peptide bound to the filters was quantified by gamma counting. Background binding was determined in the presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled peptide RRYQKSTEL. The binding constant of ICP47-(2–34) was derived from the inhibition data by using heterologous competition with ligand depletion as the fitting procedure with the program Prism® (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The affinity of RRYQKSTEL was set to 30 nm as determined by equilibrium binding; the specific activity of the peptide was 40 counts/min/fmol, and the 200 nm radiolabeled peptide in 50 μl of reaction volume had an activity of 400,000 counts/min. Peptide Synthesis and Isotope Labeling—ICP47-(2–34), Ac-SWALEMADTFLDNMRVGPRTYADVRDEINKRGR-NH2, was synthesized by solid-phase synthesis using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. At the underlined positions, isotope-labeled amino acids were incorporated in the following manner. In a first set, polypeptides labeled at a single site with 15N at either position Ala8 or Ala23 were prepared. To test in more detail the alignment of the second helix encompassing residues 22–31 (28Pfänder R. Neumann L. Zweckstetter M. Seger C. Holak T.A. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13692-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the functionally active mutant D27A (18Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was labeled with [15N]alanine at the modified position. In a second set, ICP47 analogues that are simultaneously enriched at the backbone with 15N and with a [2H3]alanyl residue were prepared. The double labeling patterns were [15N]Gly18/[2H]Ala27 (D27A) and [15N]Val17/[2H3]Ala8. The synthetic products were purified by a C18 reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography column (Vydac). The identity of the products was confirmed by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. NMR Sample Preparation—Phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). 10 mg of peptide and 200 mg of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl choline (or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl-choline/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine 3:1 mol/mol; spectra not shown) were co-dissolved in 2.5 ml of trifluoroethanol and 0.2 ml of water. The mixtures were applied onto 30 ultrathin cover glasses (9 × 22 mm; Paul Marienfeld GmbH & Co. KG, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany) first dried in air and thereafter in high vacuum overnight. After equilibration at 93% relative humidity, the glass plates were stacked on top of each other. The stacks were stabilized and sealed with Teflon tape and plastic wrappings. The sample alignment was routinely controlled using proton-decoupled 31P solid-state NMR spectra as described previously (24Aisenbrey C. Bechinger B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10502-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Bechinger B. Kinder R. Helmle M. Vogt T.C. Harzer U. Schinzel S. Biopolymers. 1999; 51: 174-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). NMR Measurements—Solid-state NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance wide bore NMR spectrometer operating at 9.4 teslas. A commercial double-resonance solid-state NMR probe modified with flattened coils of dimensions 15 × 4 × 9 mm was used (30Bechinger B. Opella S.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 585-588Google Scholar). The spectra of samples rotated by 90° relative to the magnetic field directions were acquired using a second coil of similar geometry. Proton-decoupled 15N solid-state NMR spectra were acquired using cross-polarization (31Pines A. Gibby M.G. Waugh J.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1973; 59: 569-590Crossref Scopus (2344) Google Scholar, 32Levitt M.H. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1986; 84: 4243-4255Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Typical acquisition parameters were the following: spin lock time 1.6 ms, recycle delay 3 s, 1HB1 field 31 kHz, 256 data points, 20,000–40,000 acquisitions, and spectral width 40 kHz. Before Fourier transformation, an exponential apodization function corresponding to a line broadening of 300 Hz was applied. NH4Cl (41.5 ppm) was used as a reference corresponding to ∼0 ppm for liquid NH3. Deuterium solid-state NMR spectra were recorded using a quadrupolar echo pulse sequence (33Davis J.H. Jeffrey K.R. Bloom M. Valic M.I. Higgs T.P. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1976; 42: 390-394Crossref Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) with the following parameters: 2HB1 field 50 kHz, inter-pulse delay 50 μs, spectral width 100 kHz, 4096 data points, 40,000 scans, and a repetition time of 1.5 s. The spectra were referenced relative to 2H2O (0 ppm). An exponential apodization function corresponding to a line broadening of 300 Hz was applied before Fourier transformation. Calculation of Orientational Restraints—To evaluate the peptide orientations, a Cartesian coordinate system was defined. The long axis of the α-helix defines the z-axis, and the y-axis resides within the plane dividing hydrophobic and hydrophilic sections of amphipathic helices, such as those found in the ICP47 structure in micellar environments (28Pfänder R. Neumann L. Zweckstetter M. Seger C. Holak T.A. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13692-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The computer program Insight II (BIOSYM, Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA) was used to generate Protein Data Bank (PDB) data sets of the oriented helices. The PDB structural data file was used to extract the coordinates of the labeled 15N atoms and its neighbors (NH and C atom of the previous amino acid). The coordinates of the labeled peptide bonds were needed to calculate the 15N chemical shift tensor in this reference frame using information on 15N chemical shift tensors reported in the literature (34Teng Q. Cross T.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 439-447Google Scholar), where the main tensor elements exhibit values of 223, 75 and 61 ppm. By successively rotating the peptide molecule around the z- (pitch angle) and the y-axis (tilt angle) the three-dimensional orientational space was systematically screened in 50 × 50 steps using a program written in MATHEMATICA (24Aisenbrey C. Bechinger B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10502-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Contour plots mark the angular pairs that agree with the experimental results. The simulation of the 2H solid-state NMR spectra was performed on the same principles and has been described previously (24Aisenbrey C. Bechinger B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10502-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, the coordinates of the Cα atoms were extracted from oriented PDB files. From these coordinates, the center of the mass of the Cα atoms for each of the respective helices 5–16 and 22–31 was calculated to define the center of a new coordinate system. The coordinates thus established were also used for an analysis of the positioning of amino acid residues relative to the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface. During these calculations, the insertion depth dins was simulated by a corresponding shift of the z coordinates. The z coordinates were then scaled with the following factor. Cz=0.5-11+10z-15.75 In this manner, it was possible to model a membrane of 27 Å hydrophobic thickness and an interface extending over 4–5 Å (35Ducarme P. Rahman M. Brasseur R. Proteins. 1998; 30: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The values thus obtained are multiplied with the hydrophobic index of the individual amino acid side chains (36Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17093) Google Scholar) and summed up to provide a total index for the hydrophobic effect Ihydro that is associated with the peptide alignment and insertion depth. The graphs (see Fig. 4, A and B, and Fig. 5) represent the configurations of penetration depth, tilt, and pitch angle where Ihydro is minimal.FIGURE 5Edmundson helical wheel diagrams of ICP47 helices. Residues 5–16 (helix 1) and 22–31 (helix 2) are shown in their classical representation. The side view projections indicate the distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues when the helices are inclined relative to the membrane surface (dotted lines). The coordinate system used during analysis of solid-state NMR spectra is indicated next to helix 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Solution NMR investigations have shown that the active domain of ICP47 adopts α-helical secondary structures encompassing residues 4–15 and 22–32 in the presence of SDS micelles (28Pfänder R. Neumann L. Zweckstetter M. Seger C. Holak T.A. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13692-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To investigate for the first time the structure of this potent immune evasin in the bilayer-associated state, ICP47-(2–34) was synthesized by solid-phase chemistry, and 15N and 2H isotopic labels were incorporated at single sites. The isotope-labeled active domain of ICP47-(2–34) ([5N]Val17/[2H3]Ala8) was first examined for its ability to inhibit TAP-dependent peptide translocation in microsomes isolated from human Burkitt lymphoma (Raji) cells. As expected, the isotope-labeled active domain of ICP47 displayed the same ability to inhibit TAP when compared with its nonlabeled counterpart, demonstrating that the labeling had no adverse effects on the properties of the domain (Fig. 1A). We next examined whether the active domain of ICP47 requires a lipid environment to interact efficiently with the TAP complex. We thus performed competition binding experiments with purified, digitonin-solubilized TAP or membrane-bound TAP employing the active domain of ICP47 and the radiolabeled peptide RR(125I)YQKSTEL. Solubilized TAP, as well as TAP within the membrane, displays the same affinity (KD = 30 nm). 5M. Herget, R. Abele, and R. Tampé, unpublished data. The TAP samples were pre-incubated with graded amounts of ICP47-(2–34) and subsequently probed with radiolabeled peptide. Peptides bound to TAP were quantified by γ-counting. Strikingly, the inhibition constant (Ki) of ICP47 for the solubilized TAP complex (Ki = 5093 nm) is 65 fold higher than that for TAP within the membrane (Ki = 79 nm) (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that ICP47 requires a lipid environment to bind with high affinity to the TAP heterodimer. Notably, the amount of functional heterodimeric TAP complexes was identical in both sets of experiments as indicated by the same peptide binding value in the absence of ICP47 (Fig. 1B, see converging intersection). To determine the structure of the active domain of ICP47 in the membrane-bound state, isotopically labeled ICP47-(2–34) was reconstituted into oriented phospholipid bilayers and investigated by 2H- and proton-decoupled 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The macroscopic phase properties and the membrane alignment were routinely controlled by proton-decoupled 31P solid-state NMR spectroscopy on the same samples (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the proton-decoupled 15N solid-state NMR spectra of ICP47-(2–34) in oriented phospholipid bilayers. The Ala8, Ala23, and Ala27 positions all show chemical shift values between 85 and 89 ppm (Fig. 2; A, D, and E) indicative of helix alignments approximately parallel to the membrane surface (23Bechinger B. Sizun C. Concepts in Magnetic Resonance Part A. 2003; 18: 130-145Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, the [15N]Val17 position exhibits a well defined 15N chemical shift of 108 ppm, a value close to the isotropic chemical shift position (i.e. indicative of a lack of orientation; Fig. 2B). To investigate the orientation and dynamics of this helix in further detail, the same sample was rotated by 90° (25Aisenbrey C. Bechinger B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16676-16683Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this arrangement, the long axis of an in-plane-oriented α-helix can adopt all angles between 0 and 360° relative to the magnetic field direction. A priori, the 15N chemical shift is therefore expected to vary over a wide range within the limits of 60 and 230 ppm. However, in the case of fast rotational diffusion around the membrane normal, the observed 15N chemical shift exhibits a mean value corresponding to σ⊥ of the averaged chemical shift tensor (23Bechinger B. Sizun C. Concepts in Magnetic Resonance Part A. 2003; 18: 130-145Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Aisenbrey C. Bechinger B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16676-16683Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The value observed for the Val17 position was 138 ppm (Fig. 2F) and different from the 15N chemical shift observed at alignments of the sample normal parallel to the magnetic field direction (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the ensemble of 15N chemical shift data indicates a significant amount of non-isotropic averaging at this site. Relatively weak signal intensities were obtained for the Gly18 position at ∼117 ± 5 ppm (Fig. 2C). In the presence of fast motions, the concomitant reduction of the active 1H-15N dipolar interactions reduces the efficiency of the cross-polarization technique, which allows for the transfer of magnetization from the abundant 1H to the less sensitive 15N nuclei. As a result, weak 15N signal intensities close to the isotropic values were observed for these mobile sites. The solid-state NMR data thereby reflect well the structure observed in micellar environments, where Ala8 is part of the first helix followed by a flexible loop region encompassing Val17 and Gly18 and a second helix including Ala23 and Glu/Ala27. However, when the chemical shift positions are analyzed in more detail, it becomes obvious that, in lipid bilayers, the Val17 site is less flexible when compared with Gly18. Collectively, the solid-state NMR data confirm a helix-loop-helix conformation, where the helices are aligned approximately parallel to the membrane surface. Additional deuterium NMR spectra were obtained from the 2H3-labeled alanines at positions 8 or 27 (Fig. 3). It has been shown previously that the deuterium NMR quadrupole splitting is very sensitive to the alignment of the Cα–Cβ vector relative to the magnetic field direction (24Aisenbrey C. Bechinger B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10502-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The data therefore provide additional orientational restraints (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the deuterium NMR line shape is sensitive to the orientational mosaic spread of helix domains. By comparison to theoretical line shapes, a mosaic spread of the deuterium-labeled alanine Cα–Cβ 2H3 bond of 10° is estimated, indicating that the peptide helices exhibit a considerable degree of motion that results in a broadened distribution of tilt and rotational pitch angles. A quantitative evaluation of the 15N chemical shift data indicates a tilt angle in the range between 64 and 88° for helix 1 encompassing Ala8 (Fig. 4A). The 2H data provide valuable information not only about the helix mosaic spread (see above), but the resulting line shape also limits the range of possible helix alignments relative to the membrane normal (Fig. 3A). The combination of both data sets therefore confines the helix alignment to six regions on the tilt/pitch angle topological map shown in Fig. 4A. When the data of helix 2 are analyzed in a quantitative manner, the orientational restraints of positions 23 and 27 overlap, thereby defining four regions where the orientational pairs (tilt/pitch angle) agree with both 15N chemical shift measurements. These are located around 63/166, 106/118, 74/295, and 117/348° (Fig. 4B). Of those pairs, the first and last as well as the second and third are symmetry-related, corresponding to helices associated with either the top or the bottom monolayer. Of those results, only the second and third angular pair also fit the 2H solid-state NMR data. In a next step, we refined these results by evaluating the energies associated with the insertion of the helices in the hydrophobic-hydrophilic environment of the membrane interface using an extension of the Edmundson helical wheel analysis. The helical wheel diagram allows one to view the amphipathic distribution in the projection of the helix long axis and thus to evaluate the rotational pitch angle and the penetration depth of a given helix. In this work, a third dimension representing the peptide tilt angle was introduced for the analysis. Such an energy minimization protocol indicates a tilt angle of 84° and a rotational pitch angle of 106° for helix 1 (Fig. 4A) in proximity of the region around 75/72°, which was identified by our experimental data. The small deviation is probably a result of the calculations not taking into account atomic models of phospholipids or peptide conformational flexibility. When the same analysis is performed with the structural coordinates of helix 2, which have previously been obtained from the NMR structural analysis of ICP47 in detergent micelles and deposited in the PDB data base (28Pfänder R. Neumann L. Zweckstetter M. Seger C. Holak T.A. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13692-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the most favorable alignment is 95/102° (Fig. 4B). This topological coordinate corresponds closely to the second angular pair identified experimentally (106°/118°). The data therefore indicate that the average tilt angle of the helices deviates from perfect in-plane alignments by ∼15° (±7°). These findings are represented by helix projection diagrams in Fig. 5. Notably, the calculations also suggest that the penetration depth of the two helices, when considering their centers of mass, is different by 2 Å. In agreement with these solid-state NMR data, several lines of biochemical evidence demonstrate that this α-helical conformation of ICP47 in the membrane-bound state is a prerequisite for TAP inhibition. First, truncation of the helix 1 leads to a complete inactivation of the inhibitor and failure to induce an α-helical conformation (16Beinert D. Neumann L. Uebel S. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4694-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These data show that key sequence elements in the active domain are essential for both membrane association and TAP inhibition. Second, insertion of a proline at position 11 breaking helix 1 causes a drastic loss of activity, illustrating the functional impact of the formation of an α-helical conformation (18Neumann L. Kraas W. Uebel S. Jung G. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Third, fluorescence quenching experiments suggest that the single tryptophan located at position 3 is in contact with the lipid environment, thus demonstrating that the active domain of ICP47 interacts with the membrane (16Beinert D. Neumann L. Uebel S. Tampé R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4694-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Most importantly, within the current study, we have demonstrated, based on competition binding experiments, that a lipid environment is a prerequisite for high affinity binding of ICP47 to the heterodimeric TAP complex (Fig. 1B). Without a membrane, the binding affinity of ICP47 was reduced by almost two orders of magnitude. A structural model summarizing the data discussed above is shown in Fig. 6. The solid-state NMR data reveal a flexible loop region separating two helical domains, which exhibit small deviations from perfect in-plane alignments and considerable mosaic spread. Theoretical considerations suggest that helix 1 inserts more deeply into the hydrophobic interior of the membrane (Fig. 6A). This first structural model of ICP47 in its bilayer-associated state provides important insights into the structure and topology of membrane-bound ICP47, which are instructive in understanding how and where ICP47 binds to the heterodimeric TAP complex. Based on the data presented, the active domain interacts with TAP at the subunit-membrane interface within the lipid head group region and blocks peptide translocation into the endoplasmic reticular lumen (Fig. 6B). Previous studies have demonstrated that both TAP subunits are required for ICP47 binding (12Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. Sempe P. Djaballah H. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Früh K. Tampé R.

A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In combination with similar observations for the partitioning at various peptide hormone receptors (37Schwyzer R. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the N-terminal region, with particular emphasis on helix 1 of ICP47, might serve as a membrane anchor to locally concentrate the inhibitor at the TAP complex, thus increasing the efficiency of the inhibition process. In the membrane-bound state, ICP47 escapes proteasomal degradation, which otherwise occurs rapidly in the membrane-free state. 6R. Tampé, unpublished observations. The presented structural model of ICP47 corresponds to a conformation, which is adopted just before or concurrently with the functional association with the TAP heterodimer, circumventing a disfavored soluble intermediate. This represents an elegant and so far unforeseen strategy of peptidic effectors and unstructured regions in avoiding degradation by the proteasome.

https://openalex.org/W2063244232,"Human artificial chromosomes (HACs) are alternative vectors that promise to overcome problematic transgene expression often occurring with conventional vectors in mammalian cells and bodies. We have successfully generated HACs by multimerization of a cloned long alphoid stretch in a human cell line, HT1080. Furthermore, we developed technologies for cloning large genomic regions into HACs by means of co-transfection of clones with the alphoid array and clones encoding the genomic region of interest. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mitotic and meiotic stability of such HACs in mouse cells and bodies. We transferred a circular HAC containing the guanosine triphosphate cyclohydolase I gene (GCH1-HAC) and a linear HAC containing the human globin gene cluster (globin-HAC) from HT1080 cells into mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. The HACs were stably maintained in mouse ES cells for 3 months. GCH1-HACs in every ES cell line and globin-HACs in most ES cell lines maintained their structures without detectable rearrangement or acquisition of mouse genomic DNA except one globin-HAC in an ES cell line rearranged and acquired mouse-type centromeric sequences and long telomeres. Creation of chimeric mice using ES cells containing HAC and subsequent crossing showed that both the globin-HAC that had rearranged and acquired mouse type centromeric sequences/long telomeres and GCH1-HACs were retained in tissues of mice and transmitted to progeny. These results indicate that human artificial chromosomes constructed using the bottom-up strategy based on alphoid DNA are stable in mouse bodies and are transmissible."
https://openalex.org/W2086452134,"Hypoxia is a pro-fibrotic stimulus, which is associated with enhanced collagen synthesis, as well as with augmented collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (C-P4H) activity. C-P4H activity is controlled mainly by regulated expression of the α C-P4H subunit. In this study we demonstrate that the increased synthesis of C-P4H-α(I) protein in human HT1080 fibroblasts under long term hypoxia (36 h, 1% oxygen) is controlled at the translational level. This is mediated by an interaction of RNA-binding protein nucleolin (∼64 kDa form) at the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) of the mRNA. The 5′/3′-UTR-dependent mechanism elevates the C-P4H-α(I) expression rate 2.3-fold, and participates in a 5.3-fold increased protein level under long term hypoxia. The interaction of nucleolin at the 5′-UTR occurs directly and depends on the existence of an AU-rich element. Statistical evaluation of the ∼64-kDa nucleolin/RNA interaction studies revealed a core binding sequence, corresponding to UAAAUC or AAAUCU. At the 3′-UTR, nucleolin assembles indirectly via protein/protein interaction, with the help of another 3′-UTR-binding protein, presumably annexin A2. The increased protein level of the ∼64-kDa nucleolin under hypoxia can be attributed to an autocatalytic cleavage of a high molecular weight nucleolin form, without alterations in nucleolin mRNA concentration. Thus, the alteration of translational efficiency by nucleolin, which occurs through a hypoxia inducible factor independent pathway, is an important step in C-P4H-α(I) regulation under hypoxia.

The quantity and activity of C-P4H affects the composition of the extracellular matrix, because collagens constitute the major compound of extracellular matrix proteins. The collagen hydroxylation requires iron ions (Fe2+), 2-oxoglutarate, and oxygen (O2) (1Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). Ascorbate is essential to maintain the iron ions in their biologically active Fe2+ form. Three different α-subunit containing C-P4Hs are known, resulting in the formation of three isoenzymes called C-P4H (I), (II), and (III) (2Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The β-subunit is identical to the enzyme and chaperone protein-disulfide isomerase (1Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar, 2Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and is required to keep the α-subunit in its soluble form (3Lumb R.A. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6763-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The α-subunits contain the catalytical domains of the tetramer and are limiting in the formation of active P4Hs. Thus, P4H activity appears to be mainly regulated by the quantity of the α-subunit (4Kivirikko K.I. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Vuori K. Myllyla R. Parkkonen T. Pihlajaniemi T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The type (I) enzyme is the most abundant form of enzyme in most cells, except in chondrocytes and endothelial cells (5Annunen P. Autio-Harmainen H. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5989-5992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, enzymatic properties of types I–III isoenzymes are very similar (6Annunen P. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Veijola J. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol.

They exclusively hydroxylate the transcription factor HIF (8Berra E. Ginouves A. Pouyssegur J. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both families of PHs depend on oxygen, which is of tangible importance in various physiological (e.g. altitude) and pathophysiological (e.g. ischemia) settings. The mechanisms by which hypoxia induces gene transcription is well established (9Wenger R.H. Stiehl D.P. Camenisch G. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re12PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia reduces activity of HIF-PHs that hydroxylate specific proline residues in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of the HIF-1α subunit. As a consequence, HIF-1α accumulates and promotes hypoxic tolerance by activating gene transcription (10D'Angelo G. Duplan E. Boyer N. Vigne P. Frelin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38183-38187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The C-P4H-α(I) gene (P4HAI) is one of the genes, which is transcriptionally activated via HIF (11Takahashi Y. Takahashi S. Shiga Y. Yoshimi T. Miura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14139-14146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), but additionally, as postulated (12Fähling M. Perlewitz A. Doller A. Thiele B.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2004; 139: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and as we investigated in detail in this work, it is also controlled posttranscriptionally. There seems to be a certain similarity to the collagens, which are also regulated at the posttranscriptional level (13Thiele B.J. Doller A. Kahne T. Pregla R. Hetzer R. Regitz-Zagrosek V. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This coincidence may constitute a link between collagens and P4H as a basis of their co-regulation in collagen metabolism.Long term or chronic hypoxia is a strong stimulus for collagen synthesis resulting in organ fibrosis, in particular in heart and liver (14Falanga V.

Post-transcriptional regulation, i.e. changes in mRNA stability or translational efficiency, is mainly attributed to the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs (19Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat.

Recently it was shown that in response to hypoxia, more genes are regulated at the level of translation than by changes in transcription rates (26Koritzinsky M. Seigneuric R. Magagnin M.G. van den B.T. Lambin P. Wouters B.G. Radiother. Oncol. 2005; 76: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that C-P4H-α(I) mRNA may belong to a subclass of transcripts that are characterized by an increased translational efficiency under hypoxia (11Takahashi Y. Takahashi S.

Physiol. C Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2004; 139: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to analyze the molecular mechanism in the regulation of C-P4H-α(I) expression under hypoxia. In particular, we addressed the role of the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of C-P4H-α(I) mRNA in this process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and RNA/Protein IsolationHuman fibrosarcoma HT1080 (ATCC, passages 16–21) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose; PAA Laboratories GmbH), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 15 mm Hepes, and 2 mmol/liter glutamine, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Before use in experiments, cells were maintained in a medium containing 0.4% fetal calf serum for at least 24 h. Measurements started with the application of fresh medium containing 0.4% fetal calf serum. For hypoxic conditions the cells were incubated in a hypoxic chamber (JOUAN IG750). Oxygen content was reduced to 1% by gas exchange with 95% nitrogen, 5% CO2. Control cells were incubated under atmospheric oxygen conditions (21% O2, 5% CO2, 37 °C). To inhibit translation, cells were incubated in the presence of cycloheximide (20 μg/ml). For RNA and protein isolation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. RNA was prepared using RNA-Bee (Biozol Diagnostica Vertrieb GmbH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein extracts (10,000 × g supernatants, S10) were isolated using lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Diagnostics).mRNA QuantificationRT-PCR—mRNA levels quantified by RT-PCR were normalized to relative β-actin levels. Primers were designed to bridge at least one intron. PCR conditions were used as follows: 3 min at 95 °C, cycles were 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s of annealing, 30 s at 72 °C, final elongation was for 2 min at 72 °C; 2.5 mm MgCl2. The primers were as follows: C-P4H-α(I), forward, 5′-CCACAGCAGAGGAATTACAG, reverse, 5′-ACACTAGCTCCAACTTCAGG; β-actin, forward, 5′-TGAAGTGGTACGTGGACATC, reverse, 5′-GTCATAGTCCGCCTAGAAGC; nucleolin, forward, 5′-AGACAGAAGCTGATGCAGAG, reverse, 5′-TGTTGCACTGTAGGAGAGGT.Northern Blotting—Isolated RNA was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde. The RNA was capillary transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Diagnostics), visualized after ethidium bromide staining to document the relative level of 18 S and 28 S rRNA, and hybridized to digoxigenin-labeled partial C-P4H-α(I) antisense transcripts (1,600 nt, representative for the coding region). The detection was performed using the digoxigenin RNA Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. mRNA levels were normalized to 18 S/28 S rRNA.Estimation of mRNA StabilitymRNA stability assays were performed as described in Ref. 27Fähling M.

Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with cycloheximide (20 μg/ml), harvested, and cell extracts were prepared using lysis buffer 2 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 200 units/ml RNase OUT (Invitrogen), 20 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). After a 10-min incubation on ice cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, for 2 h. Sediments represent a translationally active fraction. Supernatants represent a polysome-free fraction. After differential centrifugation, RNA was extracted from sediments and supernatants using RNA-Bee and analyzed by Northern blotting. For determination of protein localization, sediments were resolved in equal amounts of lysis buffer 2, and analyzed by Western blotting.Western BlottingProtein extracts (30 μg/sample) were separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Hybond™-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot transfer cell. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% Blot-Quick Blocker (Chemicon). Following the blocking step, the membranes were incubated in 1% blocking solution containing a primary antibody (anti-P4H-α antibody, Acris Antibodies GmbH; anti-nucleolin antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; anti-annexin A2 antibody, Acris Antibodies GmbH) at room temperature for 1.5 h or overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 and incubated with a secondary antibody (anti-mouse, Promega) for 1 h. After additional washing steps bands were detected using the ChemiGlow™-West Detection Kit (Alpha Innotech Corporation). Membranes were stripped for 5 min with distilled water, 5–15 min in 0.2 m NaOH, and 5 min in distilled water and reprobed with anti-α-actin (Chemicon) or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Acris Antibodies GmbH) antibodies to detect relative β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels as loading control.Molecular Cloning and in Vitro TranscriptionPartial C-P4H-α(I) sequences (GenBank™ gi:63252885), representing the C-P4H-α(I) 5′-UTR (133 nt) and 3′-UTR (999 nt) were amplified by PCR, cloned, and transformed using the TOPO®II TA Cloning® Kit (Invitrogen). Positive clones were confirmed by sequencing. For RNA/protein interaction studies, sense transcripts, representing the 5′- or 3′-UTR of C-P4H-α(I) mRNA were prepared as described above and transcribed using the T7-polymerase. In vitro transcripts were purified by BD Chroma Spin™-100 (DEPC) columns (Clontech).UV Cross-linkingIn vitro transcripts representing the 5′- or 3′-UTRs of C-P4H-α(I) mRNA were radioactively labeled using [α-32P]uridine-, [α-32P]cytosine-, [α-32P]adenine-, or [α-32P]guanosine 5′-triphosphate (800 Ci/mmol, MP Biomedicals Germany GmbH).UV Cross-linking Experiments1–2 ng representing 100,000 cpm of [α-32P]UTP-labeled in vitro transcripts were incubated with 35 μg of cytosolic protein extract for 30 min at room temperature in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 3 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm KCl, and 2 units/μl RNase OUT (Invitrogen) in the presence of rabbit rRNA (0.5 μg/μl). Then the samples were exposed to UV light (255 nm, 1.6 joule, UV Stratalinker) on ice, treated with RNase A (30 μg/ml final concentration) and RNase T1 (750 units/ml final concentration) for 15 min at 37 °C and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For competition assays, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled in vitro transcripts was added. For cis-element analyses by separate labeling of the four possible nucleotides the radioactive activity of all nucleotides was adjusted to comparable levels before in vitro transcription. Equal RNA concentrations (2 ng) of the resulting in vitro transcripts were used for the UV cross-linking assay.Mapping the Nucleolin Binding Motif in C-P4H-α(I) 5′-UTR using a Mathematical ApproachRelative amounts, r[A,C,G,U], of UV cross-linking signals, corresponding to ∼64-kDa nucleolin, were scanned and statistically evaluated. The signals result from the label transfer of separate radioactively labeled [α-32P]uridine-, [α-32P]cytosine-, [α-32P]adenine-, or [α-32P]guanosine 5′-triphosphate in vitro transcripts to nucleolin. The signal intensity depend on the qualitative and quantitative composition of each nucleotide in the RNA/protein interaction site. To map the protein-related intensity pattern of the relative amount, r[A,C,G,U], of the cross-linking experiments to a sequence motif in the 5′-UTR of the P4H-α(I) mRNA the following algorithm was applied. A sliding window of 6 nt was shifted over the 5′-UTR. For each position, p, the relative theoretical amount a[A,C,G,U],p of each nucleotide in the window was determined.Our mapping score is the inverse of an error function between the theoretical and the measured value within a sliding window. The error function calculates the sum of the squared differences of the theoretical and measured nucleotide fraction. At each position p the mapping score was determined according the following equation.ms(p)=1(rA-aA,p)2+(rC-aC,p)2+(rG-aG,p)2+(rU-aU,p)2 A high value of ms(p) corresponds to a high probability of the motif matching the quantified radioactively labeled pattern. Possible effects of the neighborhood are considered by the experimental design, i.e. in vitro transcripts were similar in size and sequence. Hence, the influence of neighboring sequences as well as secondary structure are considered in the assay.Affinity ChromatographyFor the isolation of mRNA-binding proteins, in vitro transcripts representing the 5′- or 3′-UTR of C-P4H-α(I) mRNA were generated in the presence of biotinylated CTP (Invitrogen). Cytosolic extracts (5 mg protein) were incubated with 1 μg in vitro labeled transcript for 30 min at room temperature. RNP (ribonucleoprotein) complexes were isolated using 200 μl of streptavidin-agarose/sample (Sigma). Samples without the addition of biotinylated transcripts served as negative control. The agarose beads were centrifuged for 15 s at 5,000 × g and washed six times (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The last two washing supernatants were used as control. The RNP complexes were eluted using high salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 m KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were precipitated, solved, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie staining protein signals representing specific RNA-binding factors were excised. Tryptic digestion of proteins was carried out using ZipPlates (Millipore) without reduction or alkylation. Tryptic fragments were analyzed by Reflex IV MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonics). Mass spectra were analyzed using Mascot software 2.0 with automatic searches in NCBI nonredundant databases. Search parameters allowed for one miscleavage and oxidation of methionine. Criteria for positive identification of proteins with MS were set according to the scoring algorithm delineated in Mascot (28Pappin D.J. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar).Reporter Gene ConstructsFor reporter gene assays the Luciferase vector pGL3-promotor (Promega, constitutive SV40 promoter) was modified. The vector-specific 5′- and 3′-UTRs of luciferase mRNA were replaced by the human C-P4H-α(I) UTRs. The UTRs were amplified by PCR and restriction sites were added by primer extension. The 5′-UTR of P4H-α(I) mRNA was cloned using the pGL3p vector-specific HindIII and NcoI restriction sites and the 3′-UTR (including the poly-A signal) using the XbaI and BamHI restriction sites. Artificial 3′-UTR parts represent the first 500 nt (3′A) and the terminal 522 nt (3′B) of the 3′-UTR and were designed to overlap by 20 nt. For the 5′-UTR mutations a partial 5′ sequence was amplified and the mutated element was added by primer extension. The quality of processed vectors was confirmed by sequencing. The resulting vector constructs expressed a constitutively transcribed luciferase transcript with or without the specific C-P4H-α(I) UTRs.Reporter Gene AssaysHT1080 cells were cultured in 96-well plates (μClear Platte 96K, Greiner BIO-ONE GmbH) and co-transfected with the firefly luciferase pGL3-promotor vector (Promega), as well as its transformed variants, and the Renilla luciferase phRL-TK vector (ratio 1:3) using the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 6 h, the transfection medium was removed, and measurements were started after adding fresh medium. The luciferase activity was detected using a luminometer (Labsystems Luminoscan RS) programmed with individual software (Luminoscan RII, Ralf Mrowka). The transfection with the Renilla luciferase served as a control.Statistical AnalysisAutoradiographic signals were scanned and quantified using the Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Results appear as means, and error bars represent the standard deviation (S.D.). Data were analyzed using the Student's t test, and the null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level.RESULTSPost-transcriptional Regulation of C-P4H-α(I) Expression under Long Term Hypoxia—Cell culture experiments, using human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, clearly demonstrate that C-P4H-α(I) is induced at the mRNA and protein levels under hypoxia (1% oxygen) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, during the late phase of a time scale up to 36 h C-P4H-α(I) protein increases independently of the mRNA concentration, suggesting a posttranscriptional component in the mechanism of expression control. We observed ∼2-fold elevated mRNA and protein levels after 10 h hypoxia, compared with control. Whereas the mRNA concentration remained relatively constant also under long term hypoxic conditions (up to 36 h) and even dropped slightly, the protein level increased continuously. Under long term conditions C-P4H-α(I) protein levels increased nearly 6-fold, compared with a less than 3-fold increase at the mRNA level. The elevated mRNA level can be attributed to the transcriptional action of HIF (11Takahashi Y. Takahashi S. Shiga Y. Yoshimi T. Miura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14139-14146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Consistently, we did not observe significant alterations of the C-P4H-α(I) mRNA stability (Fig. 2, A and B). The significantly stronger increase seen at the protein level may have two reasons: either protein degradation was inhibited or translational efficiency was increased. Inhibition of translation by cycloheximide prevented the increase of the protein level by hypoxia, indicating that the elevated protein concentration was due to newly synthesized protein (Fig. 2, C and D). Furthermore, the C-P4H-α(I) protein level dropped to about one-third by cycloheximide under both, hypoxic and atmospheric conditions. This suggests that the rate of protein degradation was not affected by hypoxia.FIGURE 2C-P4H-α(I) mRNA and protein stability under hypoxia. HT1080 cells were incubated under control or hypoxic conditions for 24 h. A, cytosolic extracts were isolated as described in Ref. 27Fähling M. Mrowka R. Steege A. Martinka P. Persson P.B.

The increased C-P4H-α(I) mRNA level under hypoxia was adapted to the 0 h control level by reduction of PCR cycles. The time-dependent mRNA decay is indicated by the decreased mRNA level. A pool of six independent samples is shown. β-Actin mRNA levels (half-life time about 4 h) are shown as a comparison and were not changed significantly. B, graphic display of mRNA decay of C-P4H-α(I) mRNA under control conditions (half-life time 1.82 h ± 0.41 S.D.), compared with hypoxia (half-life time 2.1 h ± 0.28 S.D.) (n = 6). There is no significant alteration in the C-P4H-α(I) mRNA stability under hypoxia. C and D, cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) was used to inhibit the translation of proteins. C-P4H-α(I), β-actin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) protein levels were visualized by the Western blotting technique. A representative set of data are shown and was statistically evaluated (n = 6). 24-h cycloheximide treatment reduced the C-P4H-α(I) level to one-third, which is similar under both, control and hypoxic conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether C-P4H-α(I) is regulated at the posttranscriptional level, we generated reporter gene constructs. For this purpose 5′- and 3′-UTRs of luciferase mRNA were replaced by specific 5′- and/or 3′-UTRs of C-P4H-α(I) mRNA (for a schematic illustration see Fig. 3A), and reporter gene assays were performed after transient transfection. The transcription rate of the reporter gene was controlled by a constitutive SV40 promoter. Thus, differences in luciferase activity depended solely on the regulatory capacity mediated by the C-P4H-α(I) UTRs. Long term hypoxia (36 h) did not influence the luciferase expression/activity resulting from the original reporter gene. The replacement of the original 5′-UTR by the C-P4H-α(I) 5′-UTR also showed no significant changes, whereas the replacement of the 3′-UTR led to a 1.3-fold increased luciferase activity. Interestingly, the combination of C-P4H-α(I) 5′- and 3′-UTRs potentiated the effect: expression reached a 2.2-fold level versus control (Fig. 3B), which correlated well with the discrepancy between mRNA and the protein level under long term hypoxia. Dividing the 3′-UTR into two parts (termed 3′A and 3′B) did not result in a comparable activation (Fig. 3C). Neither the individual 5′∼500 nt, nor the terminal 3′∼500 nt of the 3′-UTR reached the full activity of the complete 3′-UTR. Obviously, 3′-UTR parts did not represent the properties of the complete 3′-UTR. This is in contrast to findings after Fe2+ diminishment, where the regula"
https://openalex.org/W2059783193,"Stress imposed on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) on Ser51. This results in transient inhibition of general translation initiation while concomitantly activating a signaling pathway that promotes the expression of genes whose products improve ER function. Conversely, dephosphorylation of eIF2αSer51 is accomplished by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) complexes containing either the protein CReP or GADD34, which target PP1c to eIF2. Here, we demonstrate that the Src homology (SH) domain-containing adaptor Nck is a key component of a molecular complex that controls eIF2α phosphorylation and signaling in response to ER stress. We show that overexpression of Nck decreases basal and ER stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation and the attendant induction of ATF4 and CHOP. In contrast, we demonstrate that the mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking both isoforms of Nck (Nck1-/-Nck2-/-) show higher levels of eIF2α phosphorylation and premature induction of ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34 in response to ER stress and finally, are more resistant to cell death induced by prolonged ER stress conditions. We establish that a significant amount of Nck protein localizes at the ER and is in a complex with eIF2 subunits. Further analysis of this complex revealed that it also contains the Ser/Thr phosphatase PP1c, its regulatory subunit CReP, and dephosphorylates eIF2α on Ser51 in vitro. Overall, we demonstrate that Nck as a component of the CReP/PP1c holophosphatase complex contributes to maintain eIF2α in a hypophosphorylated state.

In this manner, Nck modulates translation and eIF2α signaling in response to ER stress. Nck is part of a family of adaptor proteins composed almost exclusively of a Src homology 2 (SH2) 3The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; eIF2, eukaryotic initiation factor 2; PERK, PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Tg, thapsigargin; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PP, protein phosphatase; ISR, integrated stress response; UPR, unfolded protein response; Tg, thapsigargin; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; Tn, tunicamycin; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type. and 3 (SH3) domains (1Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Like other members of this family, Nck is believed to couple activated receptor tyrosine kinases at the plasma membrane and/or their substrates to downstream effectors through its various SH domains (2McCarty J.H. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the past decade, identification of molecules interacting with the different SH domains of Nck has mainly implicated this adaptor in signaling processes regulating actin cytoskeleton reorganization (2McCarty J.H. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Buday L. Wunderlich L. Tamas P. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 4Li W. She H. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 947-955PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, separate genes encode two Nck molecules (Nck-1 and Nck-2) with 68% amino acid identity (5Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Chen M. She H. Davis E.M. Spicer C.M. Kim L. Ren R. Le Beau M.M. Li W. J. Biol.

Kisselev L. Graphodatsky A. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 68: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although we cannot totally exclude specific roles for each Nck isoform, their functional redundancy was demonstrated by the knock-out of either Nck in mice, which did not present any particular phenotype (8Bladt F. Aippersbach E. Gelkop S. Strasser G.A. Nash P. Tafuri A. Gertler F.B. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4586-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, early embryonic lethality (9.5 days) of the double Nck knock-out has revealed a crucial role for this adaptor during development (8Bladt F. Aippersbach E. Gelkop S. Strasser G.A. Nash P. Tafuri A. Gertler F.B. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4586-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we uncovered a novel function for Nck in modulating mRNA translation at the level of initiation through its direct interaction with the β-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) (9Kebache S. Zuo D. Chevet E. Larose L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). eIF2 is a heterotrimeric complex (α-, β-, and γ-subunit) that in part drives the initiation of mRNA translation by carrying out the delivery of the methionyl-initiator tRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (10Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Various cellular insults are known to reduce protein synthesis at the level of initiation by inhibiting the activity of eIF2 through the phosphorylation of its α-subunit on Ser51 by a family of Ser/Thr kinases, so called eIF2α kinases (11de Haro C. Mendez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This prevents recycling of eIF2 into its active GTP-bound form by the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, thereby transiently inhibiting general mRNA translation (12Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, four eIF2α kinases have been identified: 1) HRI (heme-regulated inhibitor), which couples mRNA translation with heme availability in erythroid cells (13Chen J. Heme-regulated eIF2α Kinase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 529-546Google Scholar), 2) GCN2 (general control non-derepressible-2), which is activated in response to amino acid deprivation (14Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar), 3) PKR (double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase), a component of the antiviral response activated by double-strand RNA (15Kaufman R.J. The Double-stranded RNA-activated Protein Kinase PKR. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar), and 4) PERK (PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), a type 1 transmembrane protein resident of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activated upon accumulation of improperly folded secretory proteins (referred as to ER stress) (16Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 17Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2531) Google Scholar). In this later condition, attenuation of translation due to eIF2α phosphorylation on Ser51 limits the influx of new proteins into the ER and prevents further buildup of unfolded proteins. On the other hand, reduced eIF2 activity allows the selective translational up-regulation of the mRNA encoding the stress-regulated transcription factor ATF4 (16Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 18Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar) via a mechanism involving initiation at upstream open reading frames and reinitiation at the downstream ATF4 start codon (19Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 20Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). ATF4 controls a transcriptional program that accounts for the increase in amino acid transporter and redox protein expression observed during ER stress. In this manner, ATF4 contributes to preserve ER homeostasis in stress conditions (21Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar, 22Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). Among other genes regulated by ATF4 is GADD34, which coordinates the recovery of protein synthesis by interacting with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) and targeting PP1c toward eIF2 to promote eIF2α dephosphorylation (23Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). On the other hand, prolonged ER stress conditions were found to induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) in part through the ATF4-mediated induction of the CHOP/GADD153 gene, a transcriptional activator of the C/EBP protein family with pro-apoptotic properties (for review, see Ref. 24Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). CHOP is believed to promote the death of stress cells by increasing the load and oxidation of client proteins in the ER through the up-regulation of GADD34 and ERO1α, respectively (25Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Together these events downstream of eIF2α phosphorylation occur in response to a broad range of stress conditions and therefore, are referred as the integrated stress response (ISR). In concert with activation of PERK, ER stress also activates two other ER-resident transmembrane proteins, IRE1 (26Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) and ATF6 (27Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). IRE1 is a type-I transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinase with ribonuclease activity that splices the XBP-1 mRNA (28Tirasophon W. Lee K. Callaghan B. Welihinda A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The spliced XBP-1 mRNA encodes a transcription factor that migrates to the nucleus where it up-regulates a subset of genes that contribute to overcome damage at the ER (29Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ATF6 activation occurs via proteolytic cleavage, which like XBP-1 splicing, generates a functional transcriptional regulator (30Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 31Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamammoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2979) Google Scholar). Together, IRE1 and ATF6 transduce signals leading to the up-regulation of genes encoding ER chaperones such as BiP/Grp78 and degrading enzymes, which enhance ER function and alleviate ER stress. Collectively, these events are integrated in a cellular response called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which protects cells against the deleterious effects of proteotoxicity in the ER. Functional defects in some players of the UPR have been associated with metabolic or neurologic pathological manifestations. For example, patients affected by the Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, which results in neonatal insulin-dependent diabetes, show mutations in the PERK/EIF2AK3 gene (32Iyer S. Korada M. Rainbow L. Kirk J. Brown R.M. Shaw N. Barrett T.G. Acta Paediatr. 2004; 93: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, mice lacking expression of PERK (33Harding H.P. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Jungries R. Chung P. Plesken H. Sabatini D.D. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) or harboring an eIF2α that escapes phosphorylation (eIF2α Ser51 for Ala) (18Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar) further illustrate a central role for PERK and eIF2α phosphorylation in pancreatic β-cells function. We recently provided strong evidence that Nck has an essential function in regulating the UPR (34Kebache S. Cardin E. Nguyen D.T. Chevet E. Larose L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9662-9671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Ngyuen D.T. Kebache S. Fazel A. Wong H.N. Jenna S. Emaldali A. Lee E.-H. Bergeron J.J.M. Kaufman R.J. Larose L. Chevet E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4248-4260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that overexpression of Nck strongly impairs cell survival to thapsigargin (Tg), a pharmacological inducer of ER stress, by preventing phosphorylation of eIF2αSer51 and attenuation of translation that normally occur in these conditions (34Kebache S. Cardin E. Nguyen D.T. Chevet E. Larose L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9662-9671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In parallel, we also showed that Nck regulates IRE1-mediated ERK-1 activation in response to the protein misfolding inducer azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (35Ngyuen D.T. Kebache S. Fazel A. Wong H.N. Jenna S. Emaldali A. Lee E.-H. Bergeron J.J.M. Kaufman R.J. Larose L. Chevet E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4248-4260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we further exemplify the concept that Nck regulates signaling from the ER by showing that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deleted of Nck (Nck1-/-Nck2-/-) present increased eIF2α phosphorylation levels and expression of numerous stress-induced genes. We observed that these cells induce faster and to a higher extent various components of the eIF2α-dependent arm of the UPR and cope better with ER stress. We provide various lines of evidence demonstrating that Nck, as an adaptor protein, assembles a molecular complex containing the Ser/Thr phosphatase PP1c, its regulatory subunit CReP, and components of eIF2. From these, we conclude that Nck, by being a component of an eIF2α holophosphatase complex, significantly contributes to accurate control of eIF2α phosphorylation and eIF2-dependent signaling in response to ER stress. Finally, our study sheds light on a potential mechanism by which Nck adaptors regulate initiation of translation.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar) were from Dr. David Ron. Green fluorescent protein-tagged human Nck1 and Nck2 constructs were generated by subcloning the respective Nck cDNAs into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) using appropriate enzyme restriction digestions. For transfection, cells plated in 60-mm dishes (3 × 105 cells) or 100-mm dishes (1 × 106 cells) were transiently transfected the following day using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of plasmid used was normalized with corresponding empty plasmid. For luciferase assays, 0.5 μg of the ATF4-Luc reporter gene was used in transient transfection of MEFs. The following day, cell lysates prepared in passive lysis buffer (Promega) and normalized for protein content were used (in triplicates) to assess luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Western Blot—MEFs plated in 100-mm dishes (1 × 106 cells) and treated the next day with ER stressors at 37 °C were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radio-immune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 17.5 mm β-glycerophosphate) containing protease inhibitors (2 μg ml-1 leupeptin, 4 μg ml-1 aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 100 μgml-1 Pefabloc SC PLUS). Cell lysates were passed through a 26-gauge syringe and clarified by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, supplemented with protease inhibitors). 30-50 μg of proteins from clarified cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, except for GADD34, where 8% gels were used. Proteins transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were subjected to Western blots using specific antibodies and signals detected with enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's specification. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells plated (2.5 × 104) on coverslips were transfected with 50 ng of pEGFP-C1-Nck1 or -Nck2 plasmid. 18 h post transfection, cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed in 3% para-formaldehyde, PBS for 10 min, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 PBS, and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin PBS for 30 min. Primary antibodies (anti-Nck 1793, anti-calnexin) diluted in PBS were added for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with T-TBS (5 times) and PBS (3 times), cells were incubated with secondary antibodies in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed, and DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 5 min in PBS at room temperature. Coverslips mounted in MOWIOL were air-dried for 18 h at room temperature and examined on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 fluorescence microscope (63×). Images were recorded using a digital camera (DVC), analyzed with Northern Eclipse software (Empix Imaging Inc.), and processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Cell Survival—MEFs were plated (3 × 105 cells) in 60-mm dishes in triplicate and treated with Tg, Tn, or H2O2 for 24 h at the indicated concentrations. Cell viability was scored by counting the number of cells that exclude trypan blue. Apoptosis associated with classical nuclear changes such chromatin condensation, nuclear shrinkage, and formation of apoptotic bodies was monitored under fluorescence microscopy after appropriate staining of nuclei with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as reported above. Phosphatase Assay—HeLa cells were plated (2.5 × 105 cells) in 60-mm dishes in triplicate, and phosphatase activity was determined the next day using a Ser/Thr phosphatase kit (Upstate) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-free buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA) and lysed in the same buffer supplemented with 1% Triton-X100 and protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of proteins (1-2 μg) from clarified cell lysates were processed in triplicate in a reaction containing the phosphorylated peptide (KRpTIRR; pT is phosphothreonine) in a 25-μl final volume of phosphatase buffer (19.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 39 μm CaCl2). After 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of STOP buffer provided by the manufacturer. Samples were transferred into a 96-well plate, and optical density was read at 620 nm. Optical density of the blank was subtracted from the optical density of each sample. In Vitro eIF2α Dephosphorylation Assay—In vitro eIF2α dephosphorylation assays were performed using recombinant His-eIF2α 32P-labeled by GST-PKR as previously described (40Zhu S. Sobolev A.Y. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Free [γ-32P]ATP was removed by gel filtration using Probe Quant G-50 microcolumns (Amersham Biosciences). Endogenous Nck (C-19) and PP1 (E-9) immunoprecipitates prepared from HEK293 cell lysates (1-1.5 mg of total protein) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with radiolabeled His-eIF2α as previously reported (39Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). At the end of the reaction, levels of 32P-labeled eIF2α were determined by submitting 30% of the reaction mixture to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and densitometry for quantitation. Alternatively, in vitro eIF2α phosphorylation assays were performed on crude detergent cell lysates following the approach described by David Ron's laboratory (17Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2531) Google Scholar, 38Jousse C. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Lu P. Zhang Y. Harding H.P. Ron D. J.

Briefly, recombinant His-eIF2α (10-50 ng) was radiolabeled in reticulocyte lysates using 50 ng of recombinant bacterially expressed GST-PERK. After gel filtration to get rid of the free [γ-32P]ATP, 2 μl of the radiolabeled proteins were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 5 μg of proteins (5 μl) from crude detergent lysates of 293 mock-transfected cells, 293 cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding HA-Nck-1, FLAG-CReP, or FLAG-GADD34 in a final reaction volume of 10 μl (dephosphorylation buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm ATP). The reactions were stopped by adding 2 μl of 6 × Laemmli buffer, then boiled and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE before being exposed to autoradiography. Crude detergent cell lysates were obtained by solubilizing the cells in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, aprotinin/leupeptin at 10 μgml-1, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 100 μm. Nck Overexpression Down-regulates eIF2α Phosphorylation-dependent Signaling—To determine whether Nck isoforms are functionally redundant in preventing eIF2α phosphorylation in response to ER stress, we overexpressed these proteins in HeLa cells. As we previously reported in HEK293 cells (34Kebache S. Cardin E. Nguyen D.T. Chevet E. Larose L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9662-9671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), transient overexpression of HA-Nck1 in HeLa cells completely blocked eIF2αSer51 phosphorylation induced by cell treatment with Tn, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation perturbing ER function (Fig. 1A, upper panels compare lane 4 to 2). We further observed that high levels of Nck1 yield lower basal levels of eIF2α phosphorylated on Ser51 (Fig. 1A, upper panels, compare lanes 3 to 1). Likewise, overexpression of Nck2 also resulted in down-regulation of both basal and stress-induced eIF2αSer51 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, upper panels, compare lanes 5 and 6 to lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, similar effects were observed in various cell lines (HeLa, HEK293, N1E-115, NIH 3T3), suggesting that the regulation of eIF2α phosphorylation by Nck is rather ubiquitous than cell-specific (data not shown). Interestingly, the effects of overexpressing Nck on eIF2α phosphorylation resemble those observed after CReP and GADD34 overexpression (Fig. 1A, bottom panels), two related PP1c regulatory subunits found in holophosphatase complexes that dephosphorylate eIF2αSer51 in non-stressed (38Jousse C. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Lu P. Zhang Y. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and ER-stressed cells (39Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), respectively. Lower levels of eIF2α phosphorylation in Nck-overexpressing cells were still observed for up to 24 h of treatment with Tn (data not shown) or with the calcium ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, which also induces ER stress (Tg) (Fig. 1, B and D), demonstrating that Nck overexpression causes a long-lasting inhibition of eIF2αSer51 phosphorylation. Based on our results, we conclude that both Nck adaptors antagonize the phosphorylation of eIF2α in various cell lines. eIF2α phosphorylation is known to result in the translational up-regulation of the transcriptional activator ATF4 mRNA (16Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 18Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), which mediates the induction of ISR genes. To test whether Nck modulates ISR genes expression, we assessed GADD34 and CHOP expression in Nck1-overexpressing cells subjected to ER stress. As shown in Fig. 1C, transient overexpression of Nck1 attenuated induction of GADD34 and CHOP in response to Tg treatment. Furthermore, overexpression of Nck results in a long term inhibition of ISR gene induction as demonstrated by the lower levels of ATF4 and CHOP detected after 24 h of treatment with Tg in Nck1-overexpressing cells as compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1D). We also observed that expression of the Grp94 chaperone protein was considerably reduced in Nck1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results establish Nck as a regulator of the ER stress-induced eIF2αSer51 phosphorylation-dependent ISR. Nck Localizes at the ER—Because phosphorylation of eIF2α by PERK occurs on the cytoplasmic side of the ER and Nck antagonizes PERK-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation, we then used indirect immunofluorescence to determine whether Nck could be detected in the ER area in HeLa cells. Cell staining using a pan-Nck antibody (1793) that recognizes both Nck isoforms revealed a specific and intense reticular signal around the nucleus reminiscent of ER localization (Fig. 2A). Consistent with a role for Nck in receptor-tyrosine kinase and integrin signaling, this antiserum also showed enriched local plasma membrane sta"

However, the high resolution structural information is limited to the transmembrane domain, and the dynamic picture of the full KcsA channel remains unsolved. We have developed a new approach to investigate the surface structure of proteins, and we applied this method to investigate the full length of the KcsA channel. Single-cysteine substitution was introduced into 25 sites, and specific reaction of these mutated channels to a bare surface of a flat gold plate was evaluated by surface plasmon resonance measurements. The surface plasmon resonance signals revealed the highest exposure for the mutant of the C-terminal end. When the gate of the KcsA channel is kept closed at pH 7.5, the extent of exposure showed periodic patterns for the consecutive sites located in the cytoplasmic (CP) and N-terminal domain. This suggests that these stretches take the α-helical structure. When the channel was actively gated at pH 4.0, many sites in the CP domain became exposed. Compared with the rigid structure in pH 7.5, these results indicate that the CP domain became loosely packed upon active gating. The C-terminal end of the M2 helix is a moving part of the gate, and it is exposed to the outer surface slightly at pH 4.0. By adding a channel blocker, tetrabutylammonium, the gate is further exposed. This suggests that in the active gating tetrabutylammonium keeps the gate open rather than being trapped in the central cavity.

Some residues become exposed, whereas others are enclosed in the interior. Thus the detection of changes in the exposure of residues will give information on the underlying conformational changes. Various methods, such as the substituted cysteine accessibility method (1Falke J.J. Dernburg A.F. Sternberg D.A. Zalkin N. Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol.

When a probe binds to the reactive site on the protein, the reactivity depends strongly on the size of the probe. Small probes detect whether an amino acid residue is either exposed or buried. Intermediate probes explore cavities in proteins. Large probes outline the outer surfaces of proteins. What would happen if the size of the probe becomes infinite? A probe cannot access the protein unless the target sites protrude. Following this idea we developed a simple approach. As a “probe” with an infinite size, a bare flat gold piece was used, and reactions of cysteine-mutated proteins to the gold plate were detected by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 2The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TM domain, transmembrane domain; CP domain, cytoplasmic domain; POPG, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; 11-HUT, 11-hydroxy-1-undecanethiol; TBA, tetrabutylammonium; RU, resonance unit.2The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TM domain, transmembrane domain; CP domain, cytoplasmic domain; POPG, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; 11-HUT, 11-hydroxy-1-undecanethiol; TBA, tetrabutylammonium; RU, resonance unit. signals. This method should provide information about the rough surface structure of proteins. In ion channels, domains extending out from the transmembrane domain (TM domain), either to the extracellular or intracellular space, pick up chemical signals and transfer information to the TM domain (5Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). In addition to this role as sensor, the cytoplasmic domains (CP domains) are known to regulate the assembly of the oligomeric structure (5Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). Several CP domains have been extracted, and their structures have been analyzed at the atomic resolution (6Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J.

Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 684-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) are available. In this study we applied the SPR method to investigate the global structure of the KcsA channel into which cysteine mutations were introduced. First, the method was evaluated by comparing the data with the published structure (12Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5724) Google Scholar, 15Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 16Chill J.H. Louis J.M. Miller C. Bax A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 684-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The results gave general agreements between structural information obtained by SPR measurements and those of previous reports, which allowed quantitative evaluation of SPR signals. We then focused on the surface structure of the CP domain. The KcsA channel opens at cytoplasmic acidic pH (13Heginbotham L. LeMasurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and so the surface structures were examined at two pH values. The results indicate the structure of the full KcsA channel and its dynamic rearrangements upon gating. Those changes were distributed throughout the CP domain. For the KcsA channel, a crystal structure with a channel blocker, TBA, was resolved at pH 5-7 (17Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 18Lenaeus M.J. Vamvouka M. Focia P.J. Gross A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), in which TBA is trapped in the closed structure. To see the effect of TBA under the actively gated channel, SPR experiments were performed at pH 4.0. No significant changes in the CP domain were detected. Surprisingly, we found that the C-terminal end of the M2 helix became much more exposed than that without TBA. We will discuss the dynamic picture of the KcsA channel revealed by the SPR method. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of KcsA—Cysteine mutants of KcsA were prepared for the following 25 sites: Met-1, Ala-10, Arg-11, Leu-12, Val-13, Ala-23, Val-37, Ile-38, Arg-52, Gly-53, Gly-56, Leu-86, Thr-107, Gly-116, Gln-119, Arg-122, Gly-123, Lys-131, Ala-132, Ala-133, Glu-134, Leu-155, Asp-156, and Asp-157. In addition, the 161st site was added just behind the original C-terminal residue Arg-160. QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for the site-directed mutagenesis of the KcsA protein. The sequence was confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing. Genes of wild-type and mutant channels were inserted into the pQE-82L vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), which was used to transform Escherichia coli M15 cells. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. E. coli cells expressing KcsA channels were broken up by sonication, and membrane fractions were solubilized in buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, 200 mm KCl, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm imidazole) containing 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). Histidine-tagged channels were purified with a Co2+-based metalchelate chromatography resin. Purified channels were eluted by 100-400 mm imidazole at a protein concentration of 0.5-3 mg/ml. SDS-PAGE Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed on a 15% gel. Sample buffer was modified slightly from the normal composition by reducing SDS to 0.5%. Approximately 1 μg of protein was loaded on each lane without boiling. Protein bands were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Single Channel Current Recording—Single channel currents were measured by the planar lipid bilayer technique. KcsA and its mutant channels were reconstituted into liposomes as follows. Purified channels were diluted with a reconstitution buffer (200 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.06% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, pH 7.5) to a final protein concentration of 20 μg/ml. A 3:1 mixture (1 mg/ml final phospholipid concentration) of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was added to the channels in the reconstitution buffer. Proteoliposomes were prepared by passing the protein/phospholipid mixtures through a Bio-Spin®30 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with the reconstitution buffer after incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The reference electrode was placed in the cis chamber, to which the reconstituted channels were added. A Teflon sheet with a thickness of 0.5 mm divided the two chambers. A hole (100-150 μm diameter) was made on the partition by the melt-and-shave method. The cis and trans chambers were asymmetrically buffered by 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10 mm succinic acid, pH 4.0, respectively, in the presence of 200 mm KCl. Current data were collected and stored in a PC by using pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA) through Axopatch 200B amplifier and Digidata 1322A digitizer (Axon Instruments). The low pass filter of the amplifier was set to 1 kHz, and data were sampled at 5 kHz. For the TBA block measurement, a small amount of concentrated TBA (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) solution was added to the cis or trans chamber to the desired final concentration. SPR Signal Measurement—In this study, direct binding of cysteine-mutated channels to the bare gold surface was evaluated by Biacore®X instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Sensor chips bearing a gold surface were assembled from SIA kit Au (Biacore AB). The surfaces of the sensor chips were washed chemically by Piranha solution (3:1 mixture of sulfuric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide) immediately before the measurements. Running buffers contained 200 mm KCl and 20 mm CHAPS buffered by 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10 mm succinic acid for pH 4.0. The buffers were filtered and degassed before use. Purified channels were diluted to 20 μg/ml final protein concentration with the buffers of the desired pH values immediately before measurement. 80 μl of the diluted channels were loaded into the flow cell and the flow rate was 20 μl/min. After sample loading, the flow cell was washed three times with 80 μl of 0.5% SDS to remove nonspecifically adsorbed channels. Independent experiments for each sample were repeated 3-5 times, and the data were presented as means ± S.E. S.E. values for the difference plots were calculated as root mean square of two S.E. values. Data for the difference plots were analyzed by the unpaired Student's t test, and a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Stability of Tetrameric Structure of Site-directed Cysteine Mutants of KcsA Channel—The wild-type KcsA channel bares no cysteine residues. Cysteine was introduced into 25 sites throughout the full length of the KcsA channel (Fig. 1). The mutant channels have four cysteine residues in symmetrical positions in the tetrameric channel. To test whether the mutated channels maintain the tetrameric structure, SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out (Fig. 2). The predicted molecular masses of KcsA were ∼19 kDa for the monomer and 77 kDa for the homotetramer. All the mutants showed the bands at 77 kDa. The results indicate that almost all of the mutants retained a tertiary structure even in the presence of 0.5% SDS. Partial dissociation of tetramer was found for V37C and D157C.FIGURE 2Representative SDS-PAGE profiles of wild-type (WT) KcsA and its site-directed cysteine mutants. The SDS concentration in the sample buffer was 0.5%, which is the same concentration as the washing solution for the SPR measurements. Samples were loaded without boiling. Monomeric and tetrameric protein bands are indicated on the right side. Almost all mutants maintained their tetrameric structure even in the presence of 0.5% SDS except for V37C and D157C where partial dissociation of the tetramer was found.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electrophysiological Properties of Site-directed Cysteine Mutants of KcsA—Mutants were reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, and single channel currents were recorded in symmetrical 200 mm KCl solutions. The bath solutions were set asymmetric in terms of pH (cis side, pH 7.5; trans side, pH 4.0) to record currents from functionally oriented channels with the CP domain facing the trans side. This was enabled by the sensitivity of the KcsA channel gating to the cytoplasmic pH. All mutated channels exhibited the characteristic fast gating at +200 mV and flickered gating at -200 mV (Fig. 3A). The open probability was very low at +200 mV, and it was reduced further at more negative membrane potentials. The single channel current-voltage relationships for all mutants showed slightly outward rectification (Fig. 3B). The conductance of the mutated channels at +200 mV ranged from 77 to 122 pS (the conductance of the wild-type channel was 108 pS). These results show that the gating and ion permeation properties were not affected significantly by the cysteine mutations. Detecting Surface-exposing Sites by Using SPR Signals—The direct adsorption of the cysteine-mutated channels to the bare gold surface was evaluated by the SPR signal. The flat gold plate without any surface modification imposes the hard surface with simple geometry for the gold-thiol reaction. Thus, reaction proceeds only when residues are exposed to the outer surface. Representative charts of SPR signal are shown in Fig. 4A. Adsorption was started immediately after the sample loading of cysteine-mutated channels. Considerable amounts of adsorption appeared even for the wild-type channel, baring no cysteine residue. The fraction of adsorption was not changed even when the concentration of the protein was reduced (not shown). However, the bound fraction of the wild-type was eliminated by washing with 0.5% SDS solution (Fig. 4A, gray trace). This washable fraction was assigned as nonspecific. A nonspecific binding was also observed for cysteine-baring mutants (Fig. 4A, red and blue traces). The fraction remaining after washing indicates the specific binding. As the loading time was increased, the specific binding fraction increased and reached saturation, indicating that the loading time of 240 s was enough for the gold-thiol reaction (Fig. 4B). During the SDS washing, the amount of adsorption did not increase, indicating that the gold-thiol reaction had been completed before the washing. It should be noted that almost all of the mutated channels maintained their tetrameric structure even in the presence of 0.5% SDS as evidenced by the SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1). Therefore, the KcsA channel retains its tertiary structure throughout the measurements, including the washing period. Surface Accessibility of KcsA Channel at pH 7.5—The KcsA channel is activated by acidic cytoplasmic pH (13Heginbotham L. LeMasurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), whereas at neutral pH the open state probability is practically zero (not shown). The extent of surface exposure of 25 positions in the KcsA channel was evaluated (Fig. 5A). Mutants of M1C for the N terminus, G53C and G56C for the extracellular loop region, and L155C and 161C for the C terminus adsorbed well to the gold surface, indicating the presence of structural projections at these positions. The highest exposure of the C terminus indicates that it is located at the end of the molecule, which is the first observation by this method. In contrast, cysteine residues of V37C and I38C at the outer (M1) helix and at T107C and G116C at the inner (M2) helix were not reactive to the gold surface. The crystal structure of the TM domain (12Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5724) Google Scholar) reveals that these residues on the M2 helix are buried or face the pore, whereas those on the M1 helix are exposed to the surface. The latter should be covered by detergent molecules and so have no access to the gold surface. The general agreement between the results for the TM domain with the information from the crystal structure supports the rationale for our method. By focusing on the local structure, it was found that neighboring sites displayed significant differences in reactivity. For example, L155C in the CP domain exhibited high reactivity relative to those of neighboring D156C and D157C (Fig. 5A). A similar pattern, or periodicity, was also observed for consecutive sites in the N terminus (A10C, R11C, L12C, and V13C). These patterns of the reactivity along a short stretch of the sequence suggest the presence of an α-helix structure, as has been shown by EPR measurements (15Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Surface Accessibility of KcsA Channel at pH 4.0—Similar experiments to those performed at pH 7.5 were also carried out at pH 4.0 (Fig. 5B), where the channel is activated and single channel currents were recorded (Fig. 3). There were dramatic changes in the reactivity for the CP domain. The reactivity showed an overall increase throughout the CP domain. In fact the residues at Gln-119, Arg-122, Gly-123, Lys-131, Ala-132, Ala-133, Glu-134, Asp-156, and Asp-157 became exposed at pH 4.0. Effect of pH on the Reactivity of Gold-Thiol Reaction—To evaluate the pH dependence of the gold-thiol reaction per se, quantitatively, the specific binding of 11-hydroxy-1-undecanethiol (Fig. 6A, 11-HUT) to the gold surface at pH values of 7.5 and 4.0 was compared. The specific binding of 11-HUT at pH 4.0 was slightly larger, by a factor of 1.16, than that at pH 7.5 (Fig. 6B). The results indicate that the reactivity of the goldthiol reaction itself was little affected by the pH. Comparison of the Surface Exposure at pH 7.5 and 4.0—To extract the geometrical changes or conformational changes around the mutated site under active gating, differences in reactivity at different pH values for each mutated site were evaluated quantitatively (Fig. 7A). The data measured at pH 7.5 (the closed state) were subtracted from those at pH 4.0 (the activated state). Reactivity differences (summarized by the color code on each site of the residues Fig. 7B) for mutants introduced into the extracellular loop and TM domain were negligible except for G116C. Gly-116, located at the C-terminal end of M2 helix, showed slight but significant increases in the reactivity. In the N-terminal domain, the reactivity difference showed changes in the pattern as follows: Ala-10 was enclosed and Ala-23 was exposed. There were large increases in reactivity differences in the CP domain. It should be noted that L155C became much less reactive. Thus, the local structure around the C terminus is maintained. The dramatic changes in reactivity in the CP domain indicate global structural changes and increased flexibility under loosely packed structure. Changes in the Surface Exposure in the Presence of the Channel Blocker TBA—Effects of TBA on the single channel current were examined. Fig. 8A shows recordings of multiple KcsA channels at +200 mV (left panels). Channel current was blocked at low concentration (10 μm) when the blocker was added to the cytoplasmic side (Fig. 8A, upper traces). No changes in the single channel conductance suggest TBA blocks the KcsA channel with the slow blocking mechanism (5Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). Micromolar concentrations of TBA showed no effect when the blocker was added to the extracellular side, and at 1 mm the channel was blocked (Fig. 8A, lower traces). To explore the structural changes of KcsA channel under active gating in the presence of 10 mm TBA, the SPR method was applied. In this concentration TBA binds to both intracellular and extracellular sites. Fig. 8B indicates that the pattern of the reactivity was similar to that without TBA. However, the difference plot (Fig. 8C) elucidated the significant changes at and around the Gly-116 site. The Gly-116 site is the C-terminal end of the M2 helix and is located at a linker region between TM and CP domains. The Gly-116 site was not exposed at pH 7.5 but increased its exposure significantly at 4.0 (Fig. 7A), even though the absolute reactivity was still low compared with the sites in the following CP domain. In the presence of TBA the Gly-116 site showed increased exposure to the extent similar to the sites in the CP domain. In contrast to the Gly-116 site, the Gln-119 site decreased the reactivity, suggesting the rearrangement of the C-terminal part of the M2 helix. In this study, the exposure of sites of the KcsA channel was examined with a simple experimental approach. The direct reaction of cysteine-introduced KcsA channel proteins to a bare gold surface was evaluated using SPR signals. The gold plate provides a unique reaction field with a hard, flat surface. Recently SPR measurements have been widely used for detecting various specific reactions, for which the surface of the gold is modified. However, the bare surface without any modifications is, by itself, a specific site for the gold-thiol reaction. This approach has never been applied for investigating surface structure. The development of the method required that some technical challenges had to be circumvented. Nonspecific binding was observed, which might have originated from the hydrophobicity of the gold surface and/or the KcsA channel. In our preliminary study, however, phoborhodopsin (sensory rhodopsin II) (19Iwamoto M. Kandori H. Kamo N. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Chemistry. 1. Transworld Research Network, Kerala, India2003: 15-30Google Scholar) did not adsorb to the gold surface, indicating nonspecific adsorption is not a general property of membrane proteins. To address the problem of nonspecific binding, we distinguished the specifically bound fraction from the nonspecific fraction by additional washing steps using SDS (Fig. 4A). It is likely that specific bonds between the thiol groups of the cysteine residue and the gold on the sensor chip surface would not be dissociated by washing with detergent solution. Also detergent washing did not increase the specific binding, indicating that gold-thiol reaction of intact channels had been completed in the absence of SDS before washing (Fig. 4A). 25 different single-cysteine mutants of KcsA potassium channels were investigated. All of the mutants were examined by single channel current recordings in planar lipid bilayers. The permeation properties and, especially, gating properties of the mutants were similar to those of the wildtype channels (Fig. 3). Conformational changes experienced upon gating are unlikely to be modified significantly by the mutations. Therefore, differences in the reactivities of the mutant channels should represent topo-specific reactions of the mutated sites. The sites with higher reactivity project structurally, whereas those with lower reactivity are buried. Our results from the SPR measurements at pH 7.5 provide clear topographic maps of the reactivity (Fig. 5A). The high reactivity of the N and C termini and the extracellular loop region and the low reactivity of the Thr-107 site were consistent with the results from x-ray crystallography (12Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5724) Google Scholar) for the TM domain and those from EPR studies (15Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) for the N terminus and CP domains. In the results of the high resolution crystal structure (12Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5724) Google Scholar), the side chain of Val-37 and Ile-38 points to the outer surface of the protein, whereas their accessibility was low in our measurement. This discrepancy can be explained by the detergent molecules covering the TM domain. Previous EPR study (15Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) predicted that stretches with amino acid positions 5-21 in the N-terminal region and 129-149 and 154-160 in the CP domain take anα-helical structure. Recent NMR study (16Chill J.H. Louis J.M. Miller C. Bax A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 684-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), however, suggested that stretch of 142-155 was the only α-helix in the CP domain. We support the EPR structure (15Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) from the exposure patterns recognized within the amino acid positions 10-13, 131-134, and 155-157 in this study. Changes in the surface exposure of KcsA channel were detected under active gating at pH 4.0. The drastic changes, mostly an increased reactivity, were distributed in the CP domain (Fig. 7). These differences in reactivity between two conformations can be evaluated quantitatively because the gold-thiol reaction was little affected by pH changes (Fig. 6). We could detect small but significant increases in the reactivity for Gly-116, which is located at the C-terminal end of the M2 helix. This is important because M2 is the inner helix and may hardly be exposed in the closed conformation. However, recent structural information on open gated channels revealed that the M2 helix is bent and the C-terminal half of the helix may be flipped out (20Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 21Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results support such conformational changes in the M2 helix. For the CP domain the large enhancement in reactivity leads to the loss of the pattern in consecutive sites. It is important to note that the highly exposed Leu-155 site at pH 7.5 became much less exposed at pH 4.0, indicating local structure of the CP domain is retained. These results suggest that the CP domain undergoes conformational changes and takes flexible and loosely packed conformations at pH 4.0. Exposing different faces at different conformations may result in the apparent loss of the local pattern of reactivity. Neutron and x-ray small-angle solution scattering study (22Zimmer J. Doyle D.A. Grossmann J.G. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1752-1766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) detected apparent dimerization of tetrameric KcsA channels at pH 5.0. They suggested that conformational rearrangement at the CP domain would cause the dimerization at the C-terminal end of the molecule. If it were the case, mutants substituted around the C terminus never bind to the gold surface. Our experimental results demonstrated that the C-terminal mutants showed the highest reactivity (Fig. 5B). In our experimental procedure, the pH was changed to 4.0 immediately before SPR measurements and structural changes in intact tetrameric KcsA channels could be studied. The structure of the N terminus has not been solved in the crystal structure of the KcsA channel. EPR measurements (15Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) predicted the α-helical structure, and here we call it as the M0 helix. In this study SPR signals revealed periodicity in the reactivity and supported the α-helical structure. For the orientation of the M0 helix, the crystal structure of other types of potassium channels (23Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 24Shi N. Ye S. Alam A. Chen L. Jiang Y. Nature. 2006; 440: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the helices are aligned tangentially around the pore domain. This is in contrast to the predicted structure from the EPR measurements (15Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), positioning the M0 helices radially. In this study, some positions in the M0 helix changed their reactivity upon gating, and the pattern of the reactivity changed significantly, suggesting the rotation around the axis of the M0 helix upon gating (Fig. 7). This further supports the tangential orientation of the M0 helix, facing one side of the helix to the transmembrane helices. The role of the CP domain as a pH sensor has been examined. The pH dependence was retained by the CP domain-deleted channels (15Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 25Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Therefore, the main pH sensor seems to exist in the TM domain. However, successive deletions of the CP domain from the C terminus shifted the pK values of pH sensitivity significantly (15Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), suggesting that the CP domain contributed to the pH-sensitive gating. Our results of the flexible and loosely packed CP domain at pH 4.0, compared with the rigid structure in pH 7.5, may allow conformational changes of the TM domain upon gating. In our preliminary studies, the open probability of the KcsA channel at pH 4.0 was decreased significantly by deleting the CP domain. Thus, the CP domain may stabilize the open conformation. Physiological relevance of the pH-dependent gating of KcsA channel remains unanswered because the intracellular pH should be controlled tightly at around neutral pH (26Corvini P.F. Gautier H. Rondags E. Vivier H. Goergen J.L. Germain P. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2671-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is suggested that the flexible structure at low pH may mimic those occurring upon signal transduction, in which unknown physiological signaling molecules may induce such conformational change upon binding. Upon signal transduction, the CP domain and the TM domain interplay. Also the gating movement of the TM domain may be transferred to the CP domain. What will happen if the gate is stopped by channel blockers? Recent crystal structure of KcsA channel with TBA (17Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 18Lenaeus M.J. Vamvouka M. Focia P.J. Gross A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) indicated that TBA is trapped in the central cavity at pH 5-7. We applied our method to explore the effect of TBA upon active gating at pH 4.0. There were no global changes in structure. Surprisingly, however, local changes around the Gly-116 site were elucidated. This site was exposed slightly by lowering pH, and in the presence of TBA it is exposed further (Fig. 9). Gly-116 located at the C-terminal end of M2 helix can be exposed when the C-terminal half of the helix flips out. Why did the blocker induce more exposure of the gate? It is less likely that TBA forced the gate open. The mechanism of this phenomenon may be related to familiar channel behavior that burst length (the sum of open and blocked probability) is prolonged as the blocker concentration is increased (27Neher E. Steinbach J.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 277: 153-176Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar). If the open conformation and the blocked-open conformation are indistinguishable at the Gly-116 site, the lumped “open” conformation stays for longer time in the presence of the blocker. The open probability of KcsA channel is very low at pH 4.0, and the transient exposure of this site was not long enough for reacting with the gold surface. Longer residence in the open state should facilitate the goldthiol reaction. Our method gave unprecedented information on the structure of the KcsA channel. This method with its simple and wide applicability would further provide structural information of proteins. We thank E. Perozo (University of Virginia Health Sciences Center) for providing us KcsA plasmid and T. Goto for secretarial assistance."

Although mutations of p53 are present in more than half of all tumors, mutations of Chk2 in cancers are rare, suggesting that Chk2 may be inactivated by unknown alternative mechanisms. Here we elucidate one such alternative mechanism regulated by PML (promyelocytic leukemia) that is involved in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Although p53-inactivating mutations are extremely rare in APL, t(15;17) chromosomal translocation which fuses retinoic acid receptor (RARα) to PML is almost always present in APL, while the other PML allele is intact. We demonstrate that PML interacts with Chk2 and activates Chk2 by mediating its autophosphorylation step, an essential step for Chk2 activity that occurs after phosphorylation by the upstream kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated). PML/RARα in APL suppresses Chk2 by dominantly inhibiting the auto-phosphorylation step, but inactivation of PML/RARα with alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) restores Chk2 autophosphorylation and activity.

The proapoptotic Chk2 kinase, whose substrates include p53, Cdc25A, E2F1, PML, and BRCA1, is a key signal transducer to mediate DNA damage signaling (4Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Chk2 is activated mainly by ATM in response to DNA damage of double-strand breaks. Chk2 has been shown to be essential for p53 transcriptional and apoptotic activities suggesting the possible cooperation between PML and Chk2 in the p53-dependent apoptosis. Consistent with these results, PML-deficient and Chk2-deficient mice are resistant to γ irradiation-induced apoptosis and prone to cancer after challenge with chemical carcinogens (1Wang Z.G.

Biol. 2002; 22: 6521-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In addition, PML is phosphorylated by Chk2 after γ irradiation, and this phosphorylation was shown to be important for the induction of p53-independent apoptosis (6Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). APL is a severe hematopoietic malignancy characterized by a differentiation block of the myeloid progenitor cells at the promyelocytic stage (7de The H. Lavau C. Marchio A. Chomienne C. Degos L. Dejean A. Cell. 1991; 66: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, 8Goddard A.D. Borrow J. Freemont P.S. Solomon E.

Cell. 1991; 66: 663-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The translocation of PML with RARα accounts for nearly all APL cases. PML/RARα acts as a double dominant-negative oncoprotein, inhibiting the RARα and PML pathways (10Pandolfi P.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PML/RARα is a constitutive transcriptional silencer that blocks RARα-dependent expressions. This interference of the RARα pathway by PML/RARα is an essential component of the differentiation block. Consistent with that, targeted inactivation of PML/RARα upon treatment with alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) results in terminal differentiation of APL blasts and a transient remission in patients (11Warrell Jr., R.P. Frankel S.R. Miller Jr., W.H. Scheinberg D.A. Itri L.M. Hittelman W.N. Vyas R. Andreeff M. Tafuri A. Jakubowski A. Gabrilove J. Gordon M.S. Dmitrovsky E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that a gain of function of the PML/RARα protein is also an essential feature for leukemogenesis (12Tsai S. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7153-7157Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13Rego E.M. Wang Z.G. Peruzzi D. He L.Z. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, inappropriate expression of dominant negative RARα mutants that cannot interfere with PML function suffices to block myeloid differentiation without causing malignant transformation (14Rego E.M. Ruggero D. Tribioli C. Cattoretti G. Kogan S. Redner R.L. Pandolfi P.P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inactivation of PML leads to an early onset and an increase in the incidence of leukemia in the hCG (human Cathepsin G)-PML/RARα transgenic/PML-/- mice (15Pandolfi P.P.

These results suggest that interference of the PML pathway is also of critical importance in the pathogenesis of APL (10Pandolfi P.P. Hum. Mol.

The PML-mediated apoptosis after DNA damage could be an important checkpoint in maintaining the integrity of genome. In APL cells with PML/RARα, apoptosis is inhibited, at least in part, because of the dominant negative action of PML/RARα over PML (19Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R.

These results suggest that disruption of DNA damage-induced apoptosis may play an essential role in initiation and progression of this disease (2Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Paolo Pandolfi P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 19Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The similarity and shared property of inducing tumor suppression and apoptosis after DNA damage of PML and Chk2 prompted us to investigate the possible functional relationship between PML and Chk2 in DNA damage response. We report here that PML activates Chk2 by facilitating its autophosphorylation step, an essential step for Chk2 activity that occurs after phosphorylation by the upstream kinase ATM. Mice and Cells—129Sv PML-/- mice (19Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Pandolfi PP, Sloan-Kettering, NY) and 129Sv/C57BL/6 Chk2-/- mice (Motoyama N. Aichi, Japan) were used in this study. MEFs were prepared from embryos at day 13.5 of development. Early passage MEFs (<5) were used in all experiments. Splenocytes or thymocytes were prepared from 6-8-week-old mice. Anti-Chk2 Antibodies—Polyclonal rabbit anti-Chk2 (FL) antibody (20Takahashi Y. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Zhu J. de The H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was raised in our laboratory against the GST-tagged human Chk2 recombinant protein expressed using the yeast expression system. In addition to the anti-Chk2 (FL) antibody, we have tested specificity and sensitivity of the following commercially available anti-Chk2 antibodies for confocal immunofluorescence staining; anti-Chk2 (C-18, SC-8813, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, goat polyclonal), anti-Chk2 (A-11, SC17747, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, mouse monoclonal), anti-Chk2 (H-300, SC-9664, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, rabbit polyclonal), anti-Chk2 (Cat. 2662, Cell Signaling, rabbit polyclonal), anti-Chk2 (Abcam, mouse monoclonal), and anti-Chk2 (Upstate, mouse monoclonal). Plasmid Constructs—The bacterial expression vectors for strep-tagged human Chk2 proteins were constructed by PCR or site-directed mutagenesis of Chk2 cDNA. The resulting Chk2 DNA fragments were subcloned into EcoR1/XhoI-digested plasmid pASK IBA7 (Sigma Genosys). Expression vectors for GST-PML proteins, HA-PML IV and V5-Chk2 have been described elsewhere (6Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors for HA-PML IV mutant proteins contain nuclear localization signal. Bacterial Expression and Binding Assay—The solid phase binding assay (Fig. 3a) between Chk2(FL) and GST-PML(FL and fragments) was performed as described (6Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For the solution binding assays shown in Fig. 3c, the strep-tagged Chk2 proteins were incubated with GST-PML IV extracts (100 ul) or GST tag control extract (100 ul) in binding buffer at 4 °C, overnight. GST-PML proteins were immunoprecipitated by using mouse monoclonal anti-GST antibody (Cell Signaling) and sheep anti-mouse Dynabeads (Dynal). The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GST antibody and anti-Chk2 (FL) antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Transfected cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and cell extracts were pre-cleared by incubating them with protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitating anti-HA or anti-V5 antibodies were conjugated with protein A-agarose beads in cell lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibody-protein A-agarose was collected by brief centrifugation and incubated with cell extracts (100 μg) overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed four times with the cell lysis buffer and dissolved in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assay—Endogenous Chk2 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Chk2 antibody (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-Chk2 (FL), and 5 μl of protein A-agarose beads in 150 μl of total volume for 2 h at 4 °C after preclearing the lysates with protein A-agarose beads overnight. For the kinase reaction, GST-PML fragment 1 and GSTCdc25c (amino acids 200-256) were expressed and purified. Kinase reactions were performed as described previously (6Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Phosphospecific Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Chk2-specific phosphopeptides (Thr68-P; CGTLSSLETVSpTQELY (21Xu Z.X. Zou W.X. Lin P. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); Thr383/387-P; KSLMRpTLCGpTPTY) were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). The phosphospecific antibody was purified by two-step purification method, peptide-specific affinity purification step using affinity gel coupled with phosphorylated peptide and peptide-specific affinity absorption step using affinity gel coupled with unphosphorylated peptide (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Immunoblotting of Chk2 was performed with phosphospecific antibodies (1:100 dilution) after preadsorption of the antisera with 1 mg of 293T cell lysate overnight. Confocal Microscopy and Detergent Extraction—Cells were grown on coverslips and treated as indicated. The cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 30 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. For detergent extraction, cells were extracted before fixation for 5 min at 4 °C in extraction buffer (22Lukas C. Falck J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) (25 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm magnesium chloride, and 300 mm glucose) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After five PBS washes, the cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin at room temperature for 30 min, followed by two PBS washes. The cells were blocked with 1% chick egg albumin (A-5503, Sigma) in PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature for 30 min, followed by two PBS washes. After the wash, the cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-human PML (PG-M3, SC-966, 1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-Chk2 (FL) or anti-Chk2 (H-300, SC-9064, 2 μg/ml, Santa Cruz), polyclonal anti-HA (SC-805, 1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or monoclonal anti-V5 antibodies (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight. After PBS washes, the cells were incubated with TEXAS Red-labeled AffiniPure Donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:600 dilution, overnight incubation) (Cat. No. 715-075-150, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or FITC-labeled AffiniPure Donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:600 dilution in PBS, overnight incubation) (Cat. No. 711-095-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After washing extensively in PBS and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, cells were further washed in water and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured using a Leica SP confocal microscope. Retroviral Expression of IE1—Maloney murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector pLXSN was used to clone the hCMV IE1(WT) gene (a kind gift from Dr. Dejean A, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France and Dr. Ahn JH, Samsung Biomedical Research Center, Seoul, Korea). Retroviral gene transfer experiments were performed as described (23Louria-Hayon I. Grossman T. Sionov R.V. Alsheich O. Pandolfi P.P. Haupt Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33134-33141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, pLXSN-IE1 was transfected into the ecotropic Phoenix packaging cell line (BD Biosciences). Two days later, conditioned media containing the virus was used to infect amphotropic Phoenix packaging cells. One day after infection, the packaging cells were split into medium containing G418 (400 μg/ml). After 2 weeks, G418-resistant colonies were picked and expanded in medium with 200 μg/ml G418, and the supernatant viral particles were collected. HeLa cells were transduced overnight with IE1 virus and empty vector virus in the presence of 4 μg/ml of Polybrene. After 48 h, the cells were selected in G418 (200 μg/ml) for about 10 days. The majority of PML is localized within the nuclear matrix-associated structures known as PML nuclear bodies (NBs), but also is found in the soluble fraction of the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (24Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, PML III isoform was reported to be colocalized to centrosomes (25Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). PML NBs were found to contain proteins involved in multiple cellular processes such as apoptosis, DNA repair, transcription regulation, DNA replication, and RNA transport. Although PML NBs and NB-associated proteins are easily detected by immunofluorescence staining, for most NB-associated proteins, only a subfraction of the protein is thought to be concentrated in NBs (24Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we have observed that a subset of endogenous PML and Chk2 interact and a subpopulation of Chk2 colocalizes with PML NBs (6Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, Chk2 was shown to be released from the PML complex after γ irradiation and this dissociation required γ irradiation-induced phosphorylations of both PML and Chk2 (6Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recently, other studies reported that Chk2 accumulates on the DNA damage sites briefly but is rapidly released from the damage sites (22Lukas C. Falck J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), or Chk2 may colocalize with PML NBs after γ irradiation (26Mirzoeva O.K. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Whereas our previous work (6Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) suggested that some Chk2 exists in the PML NBs, other studies have detected only diffusely stained Chk2 (22Lukas C. Falck J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). If PML and Chk2 can interact as suggested in our co-immunoprecipitation assay using commercially available anti-Chk2 antibodies, however, it is likely that PML NBs may contain some Chk2, regardless of whether the PML-Chk2 complexes function outside or within the PML NBs. To clarify the confusion regarding Chk2 localization, we performed immunofluorescence confocal microscopy with several commercially available anti-Chk2 antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”) as well as our anti-Chk2 antibody (FL), the only one for which full-length recombinant Chk2 was used as antigen (20Takahashi Y. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Zhu J. de The H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27Lombard D.B. Guarente L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2331-2334PubMed Google Scholar). We also visualized Chk2 localization after detergent extraction prior to fixation to remove most of soluble nucleoplasmic proteins (28Bernardi R. Paolo Pandolfi P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9048-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 29Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) so that the Chk2 in the PML NBs could be better visualized. Chk2 staining in human cell lines was not detectable with most anti-Chk2 antibodies tested (not shown). Only anti-Chk2 (FL) (Fig. 1a) and anti-Chk2 (H-300, Santa Cruz Bio-technology) (6Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (supplemental information, Fig. S1) enabled detection of measurable immunofluorescence signal in several human cell lines (not shown) including HeLa cells (Fig. 1a). Anti-Chk2 (FL) showed Chk2 foci as well as diffuse nuclear staining (Fig. 1a), and more than 50% of the NBs showed positive staining with anti-Chk2 (FL) in several human cell lines. Whereas the lot of anti-Chk2 (H-300, lot 1) antibody used in our previous study (6Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) showed staining patterns similar to that of anti-Chk2 (FL), the current lot of the H-300 antibody (lot 2) showed mostly diffuse nuclear staining reflecting a lot-to-lot variation (supplemental Fig. S1). Anti-Chk2 (FL) and anti-Chk2 (H-300, lot 1 and lot 2) did not detect signal in HCT15 cells that contain normal PML bodies (6Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) but no Chk2 (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). It is not clear why Chk2 foci are detected only by anti-Chk2 (FL) antibody but it may be due to the fact that anti-Chk2 (FL) was generated against the full-length Chk2 protein while other antibodies were made against peptides or fragments of Chk2 protein. Unlike Chk2 in nucleoplasm, Chk2 complexed to other proteins in the PML NBs may have many of its epitopes hidden and therefore inaccessible to many Chk2 antibodies. Immunoblotting analysis showed that anti-Chk2 (FL) is highly Chk2-specific. The nonspecific activity of anti-Chk2 (FL) was similar in HeLa and HCT-15 cells and as expected, was absorbed out when anti-Chk2 (FL) antibody was incubated with HCT-15 extract prior to immunoblotting (Fig. 1a). Absorbed Chk2(FL) sera also showed Chk2 foci staining in HeLa cells (supplementary information, Fig. S1). Although further investigations using different but yet unavailable anti-Chk2 (FL) antibodies would be helpful, these observations suggested that the nuclear staining of anti-Chk2 (FL) is due to Chk2. If a low contrast setting was used during imaging with the anti-Chk2 (FL) antibody, diffuse Chk2 staining was also visible (Fig. 1, a and b). When soluble proteins were extracted prior to fixation, the foci were prominent, and many colocalized with PML NBs (Fig. 1b) suggesting that anti-Chk2 (FL) recognizes both the diffuse- and the PML NB-associated Chk2 proteins. Anti-Chk2 (H-300, lot 2) appears to recognize the soluble Chk2 because Chk2 signal disappeared after detergent extraction. We could not perform the extraction experiments with anti-Chk2 (H-300, lot 1) because it was no longer available. Because PML is essential for recruitment of other NB components (30Weis K. Rambaud S. Lavau C. Jansen J. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A. Dejean A. Cell. 1994; 76: 345-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), if PML interacts with Chk2 as our previous study suggests (6Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), PML may recruit Chk2 into PML NBs under transient transfection conditions reflecting a potential PML-Chk2 interaction. As is the case for other PML NB-associated proteins, transiently expressed V5-tagged Chk2 (V5-Chk2) displayed a diffuse pattern (Fig. 2a). Other studies have also shown a diffuse nuclear staining of Chk2 when overexpressed (20Takahashi Y. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Zhu J. de The H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 22Lukas C. Falck J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). As expected, HA-PML (PML IV iso-form) expressed by transient transfection localized in NBs. However, when V5-Chk2 and HA-PML were expressed together, they colocalized in NBs. The morphology and size of the PML NBs formed by ectopically expressed PML IV could be different from those of endogenous PML NBs containing various isoforms of PML at the physiological level. Previous studies have shown that the region of PML required for NB targeting is the RBCC region (amino acids 1-520) that consists of three cysteine-rich regions referred to as the RING finger, the B-box (B1/B2) as well as an α-helical coiled-coil (C/C) region (31Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I. Romanienko P.J. Morales J.C. Naka K. Xia Z. Camerini-Otero R.D. Motoyama N. Carpenter P.B. Bonner W.M. Chen J. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Unlike the full-length HA-PML IV protein, PML mutants containing a deletion in the RING, B-box or coiled-coil region did not form NBs (Fig. 2b, left panel). Deletion of the B1- or B2-box individually gave the same result (not shown). V5-Chk2 coex-pressed with these non-NB forming HA-PML mutants (Fig. 2b, right panel) also did not localize in NBs. Experiments using HA-PML mutants containing a deletion of the B1- or B2-box individually gave the same results (not shown). In contrast, the HA-PML mutant containing the C-terminal deletion (amino acids 521-633) formed NBs and also recruited V5-Chk2 to these NBs indicating that PML IV can recruit Chk2 into the PML NBs upon transient transfection and the Chk2 targeting domain in PML resides within the RBCC domain. To determine the Chk2-interacting domain of PML, we performed pull-down experiments using recombinant Strep-Chk2 (FL, WT) and immobilized GST fusion proteins containing various fragments of PML (1Wang Z.G. Delva L. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Giorgio M. Cordon-Cardo C. Grosveld F. Pandolfi P.P. Science. 1998; 279: 1547-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 2Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S.

Chk2 bound to GST-PML fragments 2 and 4 but not to fragments 1 or 3. We then performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with transiently expressed V5-Chk2 and various HA-PML mutants containing deletions in the RING-, B1-, B2-, coiled-coil- or C-terminal regions in 293T cells (Fig. 3b). V5-Chk2 co-immunoprecipitated with all of the HA-PML mutants except the B2-box deletion mutant suggesting that the B2-box region of PML is the most critical Chk2-interacting domain. To determine the Chk2 domain that interacts with PML, we next performed in vitro binding experiments with deletion mutants of Strep-Chk2 and GST-PML IV (full-length). Binding to GST-PML IV was observed with the full-length (FL) Chk2 protein and the Chk2 (amino acids 206-533) and (amino acids 1-384) fragments but not with the Chk2 (del. amino acids 210-384) mutant (Fig. 3c). The same binding pattern was seen in co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed with transiently expressed V5-Chk2 mutants and HA-PML suggesting that the amino acids 210-384 region in the kinase domain of Chk2 interacts with PML (Fig. 3d). In APL blasts, which express PML/RARα, NBs display a dispersed microspeckle pattern (32Bischof O. Kirsh O. Pearson M. Itahana K. Pelicci P.G. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3358-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The PML/RARα fusion protein disrupts the structure and integrity of PML NBs by heterodimerizing with PML and causing dispersion of both PML and PML/RARα into microspeckles. The PML/RARα fusion protein retains most of the functional domains of the parental PML and RARα. The first 59 amino acids of RARα are missing in the fusion protein but the retinoic acid binding and DNA binding domains are intact. As a result, a pharmacological dose of ATRA releases the PML/RARα-mediated transcriptional silencing and causes the APL cells to terminally differentiate. Also, when APL cells are treated with ATRA, PML/RARα is degraded and PML and other NB proteins are relocalized to the NBs. Because PML is critical for NB formation, we then studied the effect of PML/RARα on Chk2 localization and activity in NB4 APL cells. As described previously, treatment of the NB4 cells with ATRA restored the PML NBs (Fig. 4a) and degraded PML/RARα (not shown). Confocal microscopy revealed that Chk2, like PML, is dispersed in NB4 cells, but a subset of Chk2 is relocalized to the PML NBs after ATRA treatment. The observation that Chk2 is dispersed in NB4 cells but relocalized to PML NBs after ATRA treatment led us to investigate whether Chk2 activity is affected in NB4 cells (Fi"

In a previous paper (Watanabe, S., Kodaki, T., and Makino, K. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 2612-2623), we identified and characterized l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the first reaction step in this pathway, and we cloned the corresponding gene. Here we focused on the fifth enzyme, α-ketoglutaric semialdehyde (αKGSA) dehydrogenase, catalyzing the conversion of αKGSA to α-ketoglutarate. αKGSA dehydrogenase was purified tentatively as a NAD+-preferring aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) with high activity for glutaraldehyde. The gene encoding this enzyme was cloned and shown to be located on the genome of A. brasilense separately from a gene cluster containing the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene, in contrast with Burkholderia thailandensis in which both genes are located in the same gene cluster. Higher catalytic efficiency of ALDH was found with αKGSA and succinic semialdehyde among the tested aldehyde substrates. In zymogram staining analysis with the cell-free extract, a single active band was found at the same position as the purified enzyme. Furthermore, a disruptant of the gene did not grow on l-arabinose. These results indicated that this ALDH gene was the only gene of the NAD+-preferring αKGSA dehydrogenase in A. brasilense. In the phylogenetic tree of the ALDH family, αKGSA dehydrogenase from A. brasilense falls into the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSALDH) subfamily. Several putative αKGSA dehydrogenases from other bacteria belong to a different ALDH subfamily from SSALDH, suggesting strongly that their substrate specificities for αKGSA are acquired independently during the evolutionary stage. This is the first evidence of unique “convergent evolution” in the ALDH family.

Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Four pathways for l-arabinose metabolism in microorganisms have been described as follows: two involve phosphorylated intermediates and another two involve nonphosphorylated intermediates. The pathway of the former is well established in bacteria (2Stryer L. Biochemistry, 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1988: 805-807Google Scholar). It consists of an isomerase, a kinase, and an epimerase that sequentially convert l-arabinose to l-ribulose, l-ribulose 5-phosphate, and d-xylulose 5-phosphate. The d-xylulose 5-phosphate is then further metabolized in the pentose-phosphate pathway. In a recently characterized fungal pathway (3Richard P. Londesborough J. Putkonen M. Kalkkinen N. Penttila M.

On the other hand, in Bradyrhizobium japonicum (9Duncan M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 113: 177-179Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Duncan M.J. Fraenkel D.G. J.

Commun. 1969; 36: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), l-KDA is converted to pyruvate and glycolaldehyde by aldol cleavage with l-KDA aldolase (EC 4.2.1.18) (referred to as the second pathway). Because no gene encoding the enzyme involved in these alternative pathways of l-arabinose metabolism has been identified, we are in the process of characterizing enzymatically and genetically the alternative l-arabinose pathway of A. brasilense, in which the first pathway is operative, and we recently identified l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase catalyzing the first-step reaction (12Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on αKGSA dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the conversion of αKGSA to α-ketoglutarate as the enzyme responsible for the last step of the alternative pathway of l-arabinose metabolism. With respect to hexose/pentose metabolism, the alternative pathway of bacterial l-arabinose metabolism, in particular the second pathway, seems to be equivalent to either a classical Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway or an archaeal nonphosphorylative ED pathway; the common final products are pyruvate and aldehyde (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the metabolic fate of l-KDA to α-ketoglutarate via αKGSA is unique in the first alternative l-arabinose pathway. αKGSA (2,5-dioxovalerate) (see the structure in Fig. 5A) was initially identified as a product of hydroxy-l-proline metabolism (13Singh R.M.M. Adams E. Science. 1964; 144: 67-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and it has also been reported as an intermediate in the metabolism of d-glucarate and d-galactarate (14Dagley S. Trudgill P.W. Biochem. J. 1965; 95: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). αKGSA is produced from Δ1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate in the former metabolism, whereas αKGSA is from d-5-keto-4-deoxyglucarate (d-KDG) in the latter two metabolisms. In all pathways defined, including l-arabinose, the metabolic fate of αKGSA is NAD(P)+-linked dehydrogenation to α-ketoglutarate, a common end product of diverse metabolic pathways. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH, EC 1.2.1.3 (5Verho R. Putkonen M. Londesborough J. Penttila M. Richard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14746-14751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) constitutes a large family of NAD(P)+-dependent enzymes found in all kingdoms of life and catalyzes the irreversible oxidization of aliphatic and/or aromatic aldehydes to their corresponding acids. Together with alcohol dehydrogenase, ALDHs are important components of cellular pathways that metabolize alcohols and aldehydes, and they have important functions in cellular detoxification and defense systems. A common feature of the ALDH family is a highly multiple nature. In mammalian systems, three classes of ALDH have been identified on the basis of amino acid sequence and intercellular location as follows: class 1 ALDH (cytosolic, EC 1.2.1.3), class 2 ALDH (mitochondrial, EC 1.2.1.2), and class 3 ALDH (tumor-associated, EC 1.2.1.5) (15Lindahl R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 27: 283-355Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A large multiple amino acid sequence alignment of the ALDH family from many organisms revealed at least 13 ALDH classes, including mammalian classes 1, 2, and 3 (16Perozich J. Nicholas H. Wang B.C. Lindahl R. Hempel J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, the identification of αKGSA dehydrogenase would provide novel insight into the alternative pathway of l-arabinose metabolism and molecular evolution in the ALDH family. Bacterial Strain, Culture Conditions, and Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—A. brasilense ATCC29145 was cultivated aerobically for 48 h at 30 °C in a synthetic medium containing 37 mm l-arabinose as described previously (12Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The grown cells were harvested by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min, washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (referred to as Buffer A), and stored at -35 °C until use. The washed cells were suspended in Buffer A, disrupted by sonication for 20 min with appropriate intervals on ice using ASTRASON® Ultrasonic Liquid Processor XL2020 (Misonix Inc., New York), and then centrifuged at 108,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain the cell-free extracts. PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE was performed by omitting SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol from the solution used in SDS-PAGE. Proteins on the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with 7.5% (v/v) acetic acid in 25% methanol. Enzyme Activity Assay—αKGSA dehydrogenase activity was assayed routinely in the direction of aldehyde oxidation by measuring the reduction of NAD(P)+ at 340 nm at 25 °C using a Jasco spectrophotometer model V-550 (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The standard assay mixture contained appropriate aldehyde, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol in 66.7 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The reaction was started by the addition of 15 mm NAD(P)+ solution (100 μl) with a final reaction volume of 1 ml. αKGSA was synthesized from potassium arabonate by sequential reactions with l-arabonate dehydratase and l-KDA dehydratase of A. brasilense. 3S. Watanabe, T. Kodaki, and K. Makino, unpublished data. Potassium arabonate was prepared by the hypoiodite-in-methanol oxidization of l-arabinose (18Moore S. Link K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1940; 133: 293-311Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters, Km and kcat values, were calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plot. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Zymogram Staining Analysis—Cell-free extract or purified enzyme was separated on nondenaturing PAGE with 6% gel at 4 °C. The gels were then soaked in 10 ml of staining solution (20Gennady P.M. Handbook of Detection of Enzymes on Electrophoretic Gels. 2nd Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2002: 27-33Google Scholar) consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, appropriate aldehyde, 0.25 mm nitroblue tetrazolium, 0.06 mm phenazine methosulfate, and 1.5 mm NAD(P)+ at room temperature for 15 min. Dehydrogenase activity appeared as a dark band. Purification of αKGSA Dehydrogenase from A. brasilense— Ten mm glutaraldehyde was used as an aldehyde substrate for the purification of αKGSA dehydrogenase from A. brasilense cells. All purification steps were performed below 4 °C. The cell-free extract was loaded onto a column of HiPrep 16/10 Q FF (1.6 × 10 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A and washed thoroughly with the same buffer. The column was developed with 300 ml of a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl in Buffer A. The active fractions containing αKGSA dehydrogenase were combined and dialyzed against an excess volume of 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (referred to as Buffer B) overnight. The enzyme solution was applied to a column of ceramic hydroxyapatite type I (1.6 × 5 cm; Bio-Rad), equilibrated with Buffer B, and washed thoroughly with the same buffer. The column was developed with 300 ml of a linear gradient of 5-200 mm potassium phosphate in Buffer B. The fractions with high enzymatic activity were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centriplus YM-30 (Millipore) at 18,000 × g for ∼2 h. The enzyme solution was loaded onto a column of HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg (1.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against an excess volume of Buffer A containing 1.3 m (NH4)2SO4 overnight. The solution was applied to a HiPrep 16/10 Butyl FF column (1.6 × 10 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the dialyzing buffer and washed with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted using a reversed linear gradient of 1.3-0 m (NH4)2SO4 in Buffer A (300 ml). The active fractions containing αKGSA dehydrogenase were combined, concentrated, and dialyzed against Buffer C (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol), and stored at -35 °C until use (referred to as sample I). Sample I (100 μg of protein) was run by native PAGE with 6% (w/v) gel. The gel was then stained in a zymogram staining solution containing 10 mm glutaraldehyde. The active band that appeared in the staining was cut off and broken in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1% (w/v) SDS. The protein was extracted from the gels by vigorous mixing overnight. A 4-fold volume of acetone chilled at -35 °C was then added to the extracts. After cooled for 1 h at -80 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 39,120 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (referred to as sample II). The sample was dissolved in a small volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 5% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) and separated by SDS-PAGE with 10% (w/v) gel. This gave an enzyme preparation with a single band, which corresponded to a polypeptide with a subunit molecular mass of ∼55-kDa in sample I (band with a black triangle in Fig. 3A). Determination of N-terminal and Internal Amino Acid Sequences—To determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence of αKGSA dehydrogenase, sample II (∼50 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE with 10% (w/v) gel and then transferred to a Hybond™-P (Amersham Biosciences) at 3 mA/cm2 for 0.5 h in a transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS-NaOH buffer, pH 11, containing 10% (v/v) methanol) with a horizontal electrophoretic blotting system (model AE-7500, Atto Instruments). After staining and destaining the protein, an area of the membrane corresponding to the 55-kDa protein band was excised and analyzed with a Procise™ 492 HT protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Chemical digestion with CNBr was carried out to determine internal amino acid sequences (21Gross E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 238-255Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Sample II (100 μg) was digested chemically at room temperature in 70% (v/v) formic acid containing 1% (w/v) CNBr (100 μl) in the dark and under N2 overnight. The solution was diluted with 900 μl of deionized water, frozen with liquid N2, and lyophilized. The sample was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE with 18% (w/v) gel. Peptide fragments on the gel were transferred to a Hybond™-P membrane as described above. After staining and destaining, areas of the membrane corresponding to the four major peptide fragments from sample II were excised and sequenced. Cloning of αKGSA Dehydrogenase Gene—As described under “Results,” the 5′- and 3′-terminal DNA sequences of a putative ALDH gene of Burkholderia cepacia strain R18194 (GenBank™ accession No. ZP_00215432) were used to design genomic PCR primers for amplification of a DNA fragment of the αKGSA dehydrogenase gene as follows: KGSAU1,5′-ATGGCTAACGTGACTTATACGGATACGCAACTGCTGATCGACGG-3′; and KGSAD1,5′-TCAGACGGCCATCACCGTCACCGACTTCGTGACGAGGTACGG-3′. A. brasilense genomic DNA was prepared using a DNeasy™ tissue kit (Qiagen). PCR was carried out using a PCR Thermal Cycler PERSONAL (Takara) for 30 cycles in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 pmol of primers, 1.25 unit of Ex Taq® DNA polymerase (Takara), and 300 ng of A. brasilense genomic DNA under the following conditions: denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, each for 30 cycles. A PCR single product with a length of ∼1.5-kbp was purified, cloned into a pGEM®-T vector (referred to as pGEM3 in Fig. 2), and sequenced using a Dual CyDye™ terminator sequencing kit (Veritas) and appropriate primers with Long-Read Tower, UBC DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). For Southern hybridization, ∼1.8 μg of A. brasilense genomic DNA was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, separated on 1% (w/v) agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond™-N (Amersham Biosciences). Probe DNA, amplified by PCR with AraE-UP1 and AraE-DOWN1 primers and pGEM3 as a template, was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP and hybridized using a DIG-High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit (Roche Applied Science). The membrane was visualized using a nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate reagent detection system (Roche Applied Science). For the identification of 5′- and 3′-terminal nucleotide sequences of the αKGSA dehydrogenase gene, two synthetic oligonucleotide primers were designed from the flanking region of the ALDH gene of B. cepacia R18194 as follows: KGSAU2, 5′-CGGCGGACGTCGCGAAACTCCGCAAGGCGACGGCG-3′; and KGSAD2, 5′-GCGCGCACGCGATCAAGGTCCCCGCCAGCACAACG-3′. A single product with a length of ∼2.3-kbp obtained by A. brasilense genomic PCR was purified, cloned into a pGEM®-T vector (referred to as pGEM4), and sequenced. Functional Expression and Purification of His6-tagged αKGSA Dehydrogenase—To clone the αKGSA dehydrogenase gene into the expression plasmid vector, two synthetic oligonucleotide primers were designed as follows: KGSAU3, 5′-caccatggatccGCTAACGTGACTTATACGGATACGCAACTGC-3′; and KGSAD3, 5′-gcttggctgcagTCAGACGGCCATCACCGTCACCGACTTCGTGACC-3′ (small letters indicate additional bases for introducing digestion sites of BamHI and PstI (underlined letters), respectively). PCR was carried out using pGEM4 as a template and KGSAU3 and KGSAD3 as primers, and the amplified DNA fragment was then introduced into BamHI-PstI sites in pQE-80L (Qiagen), a plasmid vector for conferring N-terminal His6 tag on the expressed proteins, to obtain pHISKGSA. E. coli DH5α harboring the pHISKGSA plasmid was grown at 37 °C to a turbidity of 0.6 at 600 nm in Super Broth medium (pH 7.0, 12 g of tryptone, 24 g of yeast extract, 5 ml of glycerol, 3.81 g of KH2PO4, and 12.5 g of K2HPO4 per liter) containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin. After the addition of 1 mm of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the culture was further grown for 6 h to induce the expression of His6-tagged αKGSA dehydrogenase protein. Cells were harvested and resuspended in Buffer D (pH 8.0, 50 mm sodium phosphate containing 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole). The cells were then disrupted by sonication, and the solution was centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column (Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer D. The column was washed three times with Buffer E (pH 8.0, Buffer D containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 50 mm imidazole instead of 10 mm imidazole). The enzymes were then eluted with Buffer F (pH 8.0, Buffer E containing 250 mm imidazole instead of 50 mm imidazole). The eluant was dialyzed against Buffer C and stored at -35 °C until used. The native molecular weight of αKGSA dehydrogenase was estimated by gel filtration. The purified enzyme was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol instead of 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. High and low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences) were used as molecular markers. Western Blot Analysis of His6-tagged αKGSA Dehydrogenase— For Western blot analysis, purified αKGSA dehydrogenase from A. brasilense and/or recombinant His6-tagged αKGSA dehydrogenase from E. coli were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins on the gels were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™-ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Western blot analysis was carried out using the ECL™ Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences) and RGS·His horseradish peroxidase antibody, a horseradish peroxidase-fused mouse monoclonal antibody against Arg-Gly-Ser-His6 in the N-terminal additional peptide of the expressed recombinant proteins (Qiagen). Product Identification by HPLC—The product of the dehydrogenation reaction of αKGSA was identified by HPLC with a Multistation LC-8020 model II system (Tosoh). A solution containing 66.7 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10 mm αKGSA or succinic semialdehyde, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NAD+, and the purified His6-tagged enzyme (10 μg) was incubated at 25 °C, and 100 μl of this solution was then analyzed. Samples were applied at 35 °C to an Aminex HPX-87H Organic Analysis column (300 × 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad) monitored with an RID-8020 refractive index detector (Tosoh) and eluted with 5 mm H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Disruptant Construction—For the construction of a disputant strain of the αKGSA dehydrogenase gene, pHISKGSA was digested with SalI to remove the 0.5-kbp DNA fragment within the αKGSA dehydrogenase gene, and a 5.7-kbp DNA fragment was purified. The resulting DNA fragment was ligated with the Tn5-derived 1.3-kb SalI kanamycin resistance (Kmr) cassette of pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences) to yield pHISKGSA::Km. To introduce the restriction site for MfeI at the 5′- and 3′-end of the DNA fragment containing the Kmr cassette in the αKGSA dehydrogenase gene, PCR was carried out using pHISKGSA::Km as a template and the following two primers (lowercase letters indicate additional bases for introducing digestion sites of MfeI (underlined letters)): 5′-caccatcaattgATGGCTAACGTGACTTATACGGATACGCAAC-3′ (MfeI-up) and 5′-gcttggcaattgTCAGACGGCCATCACCGTCACCGACTTCGTGAC-3′ (MfeI-down). The 2.2-kbp MfeI DNA fragment was subcloned into EcoRI site in the chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr) cassette of the suicide vector pSUP202 (Ampr, Tetr, and Cmr) (22Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 789-791Crossref Scopus (5561) Google Scholar) to yield pSUPKGSA::Km (Ampr, Tetr, CmS, and Kmr). Escherichia coli S17-1 (22Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 789-791Crossref Scopus (5561) Google Scholar) was transformed with pSUPKGSA::Km, and then the transformant was further mobilized to A. brasilense by biparental mating. The transconjugants were selected on a minimal medium agar plate supplemented with 5 g of sodium malate and 25 μg of kanamycin per liter using Kmr (the presence of Kmr cassette) and TcS (loss of pSUP202) phenotypes. The construction was confirmed by genomic PCR. One of the three resulting disruptants of A. brasilense was named ΔARA0512 and was used in this study. Northern Blot Analysis—A. brasilense cells were cultured at 30 °C to the mid-log phase (A600 = 0.6-0.8) in minimal medium supplemented with 37 mm appropriate carbon source (l-arabinose, d-glucose, d-glucarate, or d-galactarate) or nutrient medium (12Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and harvested by centrifugation. Total RNA preparation and Northern hybridization were performed as described previously (12Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The same labeling probe as used in Southern blot analysis was used for the detection of mRNA of the αKGSA dehydrogenase gene. Amino Acid Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis— For phylogenetic analysis, 145 ALDH sequences were obtained from a website devoted to ALDHs (see Ref. 16Perozich J. Nicholas H. Wang B.C. Lindahl R. Hempel J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several ALDH sequences, which had been recently identified, were added. The sequences were aligned using the program, ClustalW, distributed by DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). The phylogenetic tree was produced using the TreeView 1.6.1. program. αKGSA Dehydrogenase from A. brasilense—In our previous study (12Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we identified the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene of A. brasilense, which shows very high similarity to a putative dehydrogenase gene of B. cepacia strain R18149 (GenBank™ accession number ZP_00218291) in nucleotide sequences (94.9% of identity). On the genome of B. cepacia strain R18149, the l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase gene homolog forms a putative single transcriptional unit with six other genes (Fig. 3). This gene cluster is thought to be a novel l-arabinose operon distinct from the araBCD operon found in many bacteria including E. coli. On the other hand, Burkholderia thailandensis, a close relative of the bacterium B. cepacia strain R18149, possesses an additional ALDH-like gene in the equivalent gene cluster (Fig. 3) (NCBI accession number ABC34247). Because a disruptant of the additional ALDH-like gene shows an l-arabinose-negative phenotype (23Moore R.A. Reckseidler-Zenteno S. Kim H. Nierman W. Yu Y. Tuanyok A. Warawa J. DeShazer D. Woods D.E. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4172-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the gene product is thought to be a candidate for αKGSA dehydrogenase without direct enzymatic evidence. To estimate which types of gene cluster A. brasilense possesses, we carried out genomic PCR using two synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed from the genome of B. cepacia strain R18149 and A. brasilense genome DNA as a template (Fig. 2). As the gene cluster did not contain the ALDH-like gene on the genome of A. brasilense as well as B. cepacia strain R18149 (data not shown), the αKGSA dehydrogenase gene should be located separately from the gene cluster on the genome of A. brasilense. It is known that several ALDHs for αKGSA (not usually referred to as a “αKGSA dehydrogenase”) also show activity with glutaraldehyde (24Stoolmiller A.C. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5764-5771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Adams E. Rosso G. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1802-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Koo P.H. Adams E. J.

Two receptors, types 1 and 2, coordinately mediate BMP signaling, and type 1 receptor has two forms: A and B. Using RT-PCR we found that neural crest-derived human melanocytes express BMP receptor-1A, -1B, and -2. Furthermore, melanocytes and the surrounding keratinocytes express BMP-4, suggesting both autocrine and paracrine effects of this molecule. Moreover, BMP-4 supplementation of cultured human melanocytes decreases melanin synthesis, tyrosinase mRNA, and protein. The mechanism of this BMP-4 effect on tyrosinase and ultimately on melanogenesis involves modest decreases of tyrosinase transcription rate and mRNA stability. Moreover, ultraviolet irradiation, the best recognized environmental stimulator of melanogenesis, down-regulated the mRNA of BMP receptor-1B in melanocytes. Our data provide evidence of a novel regulatory pathway for melanogenesis in human skin.

Melanocytes are neural crest-derived cells that migrate to the epidermis during embryogenesis and subsequently synthesize and distribute melanin to surrounding keratinocytes (reviewed in Ref. 1Halaban R. Hebert D.N. Fisher D.E. Freedberg I.M. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Austen K.F. Goldsmith L.A. Katz S.I. Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. 1. McGraw-Hill, New York2003: 127-148Google Scholar). The rate-limiting enzyme in melanin biosynthesis is tyrosinase, and subsequent reactions involving tyrosinase and other melanogenic enzymes, tyrosinase-related proteins (TRP) 1 and 2, result in melanin synthesis and deposition in specialized organelles called melanosomes (1Halaban R. Hebert D.N. Fisher D.E. Freedberg I.M. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Austen K.F. Goldsmith L.A. Katz S.I. Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. 1. McGraw-Hill, New York2003: 127-148Google Scholar). The major known stimulator of melanin biosynthesis is ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (2Gilchrest B.A. Park H.Y. Eller M.S. Yaar M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). UV irradiation directly stimulates melanogenesis in pigment cells (3Friedmann P.S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and also induces the expression and synthesis of a variety of cytokines, primarily of keratinocyte origin, that act in a paracrine fashion to further induce melanogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 4Imokawa G. Pigment Cell Res. 2004; 17: 96-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In addition, several keratinocyte-derived cytokines known to inhibit human melanogenesis have been identified. These include interleukin (IL) 3The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; BMP-R, BMP receptor; TGF, transforming growth factor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.-1α, a cytokine that is also produced by melanocytes (5Swope V.B. Sauder D.N. McKenzie R.C. Sramkoski R.M. Krug K.A. Babcock G.F. Nordlund J.J. Abdel-Malek Z.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 749-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (6Swope V.B. Abdel-Malek Z. Kassem L.M. Nordlund J.J. J Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 180-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (7Martinez-Esparza M. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Beermann F. Aparicio P. Lozano J.A. Garcia-Borron J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3967-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Martinez-Esparza M. Ferrer C. Castells M.T. Garcia-Borron J.C. Zuasti A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). IL-1α, IL-6, and TNF-α were reported to inhibit melanogenesis by inhibiting tyrosinase activity (6Swope V.B. Abdel-Malek Z. Kassem L.M. Nordlund J.J. J Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 180-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They also decrease melanocyte proliferation, yet are not toxic to the cells (6Swope V.B. Abdel-Malek Z. Kassem L.M. Nordlund J.J. J Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 180-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of these cytokines on tyrosinase expression, protein level, and stability is not known. More recently, it was reported that TGF-β1 also inhibits tyrosinase activity in B16 melanoma cells and in black non-agouti murine melanocytes (7Martinez-Esparza M. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Beermann F. Aparicio P. Lozano J.A. Garcia-Borron J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3967-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Martinez-Esparza M. Ferrer C. Castells M.T. Garcia-Borron J.C. Zuasti A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In B16 cells, TGF-β1 decreases tyrosinase expression and increases protein degradation (7Martinez-Esparza M. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Beermann F. Aparicio P. Lozano J.A. Garcia-Borron J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3967-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in these cells TGF-β1 also decreases the protein level of TRP-1 without affecting its mRNA level (7Martinez-Esparza M. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Beermann F. Aparicio P. Lozano J.A. Garcia-Borron J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3967-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that TGF-β1 inhibits melanogenesis, at least in part, by post-translational modification of melanogenic enzymes. Bone morphogenetic proteins are secreted signaling molecules that belong to the TGF-β superfamily (reviewed in Ref. 9Botchkarev V.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 36-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). While originally identified as molecules that stimulate bone formation (10Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar), it is now well established that BMPs affect other tissues, inducing various effects like proliferation that oppose differentiation and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 11Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar and 12Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To date, more than 20 different BMP proteins have been identified, all sharing structural homology and interaction with specific BMP receptors (11Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 12Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). BMP effects depend on many factors including tissue concentration (11Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 13Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), BMP type, presence of antagonists, embryonic stage of the target tissue, and the type of receptors expressed by the target cells (9Botchkarev V.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 36-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). BMPs bind two transmembrane receptors, BMP receptor (BMP-R)1 and BMP-R2 (11Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). BMP-R1, when present as a monomer, binds BMP with low affinity. However, when BMP-R1 and BMP-R2 are present as a heterodimer, their affinity for BMP is substantially increased (11Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Interestingly, to initiate signaling, BMP has to bind both receptors, inducing phosphorylation of an intracellular domain in BMP-R1 by BMP-R2 and activating intracellular signal transduction. Thus, both BMP-R1 and BMP-R2 are required to mediate BMP effects. Interestingly, there are several BMP-R1 receptors, BMP-R1A (Alk3), BMP-R1B (Alk6), and ActR-1 (Alk2) (14Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and in neural precursor cells signaling through BMP-R1A induces their proliferation while BMP-R1B induces their differentiation (15Panchision D.M. Pickel J.M. Studer L. Lee S.H. Turner P.A. Hazel T.G. McKay R.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2094-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), suggesting that receptor expression determines the BMP effect on cells. Noggin is a secreted BMP antagonist that competes for binding to BMP receptors (reviewed in Ref. 16Chen D. Zhao M. Mundy G.R. Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Our group has recently shown that mice overexpressing noggin in the hair follicle epithelium display darker coat color than wild-type mice (17Sharov A.A. Fessing M. Atoyan R. Sharova T.Y. Haskell-Luevano C. Weiner L. Funa K. Brissette J.L. Gilchrest B.A. Botchkarev V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), demonstrating that BMP signaling influence murine melanogenesis in vivo. We now report that normal neonatal human melanocytes and keratinocytes express BMP-4. Melanocytes express in addition BMP-R1A, -1B, and -2. BMP-4 stimulation of melanocytes leads to decreased tyrosinase mRNA, in part by decreasing message stability and in part by repressing tyrosinase promoter activity. BMP-4 also decreases tyrosinase protein and activity and decreases melanin level. Finally, UV irradiation transiently decreases the level of BMP-R1B in melanocytes, consistent with its role as the major environmental melanogenic stimulator. Our study provides evidence of a novel signaling pathway that influences melanocyte function in human skin. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Medium 199, Leibovitz's L-15 medium, non-essential amino acids, and insulin were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone Labs, Logan, UT. Lipofectamine Plus Reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent was purchased from Bio-Rad. Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System was purchased from Promega, Madison, WI. Recombinant human BMP-4 was obtained from R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN. Tyrosinase antibodies were obtained from Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle, UK and used at a dilution of 1:500. pRL-null vector containing Renilla luciferase reporter gene was purchased from Promega. Human tyrosinase cDNA (Pmel 34) was the kind gift of B. Kwon (Indianapolis, IN). The cell death detection ELISAPLUS kit was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Cell Culture—Primary melanocyte cultures were prepared from newborn foreskin as described (18Gilchrest B.A. Albert L.S. Karassik R.L. Yaar M. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1985; 21: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of melanocytes were subcultured and maintained in Medium 199 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, 10–9 m triiodothyronine, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10 μg/ml myoinositol, 1.4 × 10–6 m hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 80 μm dibutyryl cAMP, and bovine hypothalamic extract (100 μg/ml). MM4 human melanoma cells were obtained from Dr. U. Stierner (Gothenburg, Sweden) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (55%), L15 (27%), fetal bovine serum (15%), nonessential amino acids (1%), glutamine (2 mm), and insulin (10 μg/ml) (19Park H.Y.

Keratinocytes were established from neonatal foreskin or adult skin as described (20Gilchrest B.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1979; 72: 219-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Yaar M. Gilani A. DiBenedetto P.J. Harkness D.D. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For experimental use, first subcultures of the primary keratinocyte cultures were used. Cells were grown as previously described (21Yaar M. Gilani A. DiBenedetto P.J. Harkness D.D. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in serum-free Medium 199 (Invitrogen) containing 0.09 mm CaCl2 with 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 10–9 m triiodothyronine (Sigma), 10 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma), 1.4 × 10–6 m hydrocortisone (Calbiochem-Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA), 2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml choline chloride (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml inositol (Sigma). Melanin Content—1 × 105 cells were spun at 2500 rpm for 15 min, and the pellet was then dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH. Melanin concentration was calculated by A475 and compared with a standard curve of synthetic melanin as previously described (22Eller M.S. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 413-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Tyrosinase Activity—Tyrosinase activity was measured up to 3 days after BMP-4 stimulation as described (23Pomerantz S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 16: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 105 cells were sonicated in 80 mm PO4 (pH 6.8) containing 1% Triton X-100, and tyrosinase was extracted for 60 min at 4 °C. 2–5 μg of cellular proteins were incubated with 31.25 μm l-tyrosine, 3.125 nml-dihydroxyphenylalanine, and 5 μCi of l-[3,5-3H]tyrosine (40–60 Ci per mmol) for 30–60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 250 μl of 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Trichloroacetic acid-soluble material was reacted with Norit A, and released 3H2O was measured using a scintillation counter. The activity was expressed as counts per minute of 3H2O released per microgram protein per hour minus the nonspecific incorporation of radioactivity, determined by using lysate boiled with β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min (background, generally less than 5–10% of the sample). DNA Transfection—Plasmids containing the mouse 6.1-kb tyrosinase promoter (pTYRCAT6) as well as deletion mutations of the promoter (60 bp, 280 bp and 3.8 kb) (24Kluppel M. Beermann F. Ruppert S. Schmid E. Hummler E. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3777-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) and the empty vector (pBLCAT3) were transfected into MM4 cells together with a plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase reporter gene (pRL-null Vector). The expression of Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control to normalize the expression of firefly luciferase. Twenty-four hours before transfection, cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105/60-mm culture dish. Prior to transfection, medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 4 μg of pTYRCAT6 or pBLCAT3 together with 0.2 μg of pRL-null vector were suspended in 12 μl of Lipofectamine Reagent and 16 μl of Plus Reagent; the suspension was added to the medium for 3 h. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were supplemented with BMP-4 (25 ng/ml) or vehicle alone. Two days after BMP-4 supplementation, total cellular proteins were harvested and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system. Fluorescence intensity was determined using a luminometer (Turner Biosystems Model TD-20/20). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells with the Tri-Reagent kit (Invitrogen) following the protocol of the manufacturer. RNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm. The purity of the preparations was determined by the 260/280 absorbance ratio, which was consistently ≥1.8. 20 μg/lane of denatured RNA samples were separated on 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde as previously described (26Verdier-Sevrain S. Yaar M. Cantatore J. Traish A. Gilchrest B.A. Faseb. J. 2004; 18: 1252-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). RNA was transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences) and was immobilized by shortwave UV irradiation (UV-Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Blots were prehybridized for 2 h at 45 °C in a solution containing formamide, Denhart's solution, dextran sulfate, and denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 45 °C in the same solution containing 32P-labeled tyrosinase cDNA. Autoradiography with XAR film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) and development after overnight exposure at –70 °C was performed as described previously (27Yaar M. Eller M.S. DiBenedetto P. Reenstra W.R. Zhai S. McQuaid T. Archambault M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 1550-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). mRNA Stability—Melanocytes were stimulated with BMP-4 (25 ng/ml) or with diluent as above. At the time of BMP-4 treatment actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) was added to cultures. Total cellular RNA was harvested before and at different intervals after stimulation, processed for northern blotting and hybridized to tyrosinase cDNA. Tyrosinase mRNA half-life was determined after densitometric analysis of band intensity. Western Blot Analysis—Total cellular proteins were collected in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer consisting of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.375 m NaCl, 2.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin as described (26Verdier-Sevrain S. Yaar M. Cantatore J. Traish A. Gilchrest B.A. Faseb. J. 2004; 18: 1252-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method, and 50–100 μg protein/lane were processed for Western blot analysis as described (26Verdier-Sevrain S. Yaar M. Cantatore J. Traish A. Gilchrest B.A. Faseb. J. 2004; 18: 1252-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Antibody reactions were performed with mouse monoclonal anti tyrosinase antibody followed by HRP-tagged goat anti-mouse IgG (secondary antibody, Bio-Rad). The secondary antibodies were used at 1:2000 dilution. Antibody binding was detected by the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences), followed by autoradiography (Kodak X-Omatic AR). PCR Amplification—Total melanocyte RNA was harvested as above. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription as described (27Yaar M. Eller M.S. DiBenedetto P. Reenstra W.R. Zhai S. McQuaid T. Archambault M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 1550-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl volume was reverse-transcribed using oligo pd(N)6 (Amersham Biosciences) as a primer. Reverse transcription was carried out for 1 h at 37°C. A 1-μl aliquot of this reverse transcription product (0.1μg of cDNA) was then amplified with 15 pmol of each forward and reverse primers complementary to the human published sequences (28Mohan R.R. Kim W.J. Chen L. Wilson S.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2626-2636PubMed Google Scholar). BMP-R1A: upstream primer, GGACATTGCTTTGCCATCATA and downstream primer, CAGACCCACTACCAGAACTTT; BMP-R1B: upstream primer, GTTGTAAATGCCACCACCATT and downstream primer, GTCTGGTTTCTTGTCTTTTAT; BMP-R2: upstream primer, TGGCTGAACTTATGATGATTT and downstream primer, TGTTGGTGGAGAGGCTGGTGA; BMP-4, upstream primer, ACCTGAGACGGGGAAGAAAA and downstream primer, TTAAAGAGGAAACGAAAAGCA; Tyrosinase: upstream primer, TCAGACCCAGACTCTTTTCA and downstream primer, GAACCTGGACATTACTTTGA; GAPDH: upstream primer, GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCA and downstream primer, TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG. Initially, 37 cycles of amplification were performed on cDNA as well as on RNA from each sample to assure no contamination of RNA samples with genomic DNA. Subsequently, all PCR reactions were terminated at the exponential phase of the amplification (BMP and BMP-Rs 29 cycles, tyrosinase 35 cycles, and GAPDH 26 cycles), which was found to be sufficient for optimal detection of BMP receptors, BMP-4, tyrosinase, and GAPDH and allowed analysis of mRNA transcript modulation. Denaturation was performed at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 58 °C for 1 min, and DNA polymerization at 72 °C for 1 min in a thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA). PCR products were separated over a 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE and stained with ethidium bromide. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (QRT-PCR)—The mRNA expression of BMP-R1A and -R1B was also analyzed using MyiQ™ optical module Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad) and iQ SYBR® Green Supermix containing the following primers: BMP-R1A: upstream primer, TTGTCCTGTGTCCTTAGTGATG and downstream primer, AGTAAATGGCTTGTATGAGATTGG; BMP-R1B: upstream primer, GCAGCACAGACGGATATTG and downstream primer, GGCAGTGTAGGGTGTAGG; β-actin: upstream primer, GCATTGTTACAGGAAGTCC and downstream primer, CATTACATAATTTACACGAAAGC. The PCR reaction was performed in a 50-μl volume containing 2–4 ng of cDNA. The final primer and probe concentrations were optimized for each primer/probe combination. Two-step PCR cycling was carried as follows: 95 °C 5 min × 1 cycle, 95 °C 0.5 min, 55 °C 0.5 min × 40 cycles. Apoptosis Analysis—DNA fragmentation as a measure of apoptosis was determined using the cell death detection ELISAPLUS kit and following the manufacturer's instructions (29Reinartz J. Bechtel M.J. Kramer M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, melanocytes were stimulated with BMP-4 (25 ng/ml), and cells were harvested 24 and 48 h after stimulation. 1 × 104 cells were used as antigen source in a sandwich ELISA assay with a primary anti-histone antibody coated to the microtiter plate and a secondary anti-DNA antibody coupled to peroxidase. For positive control, we used the squamous carcinoma line SCC 12F (30Rheinwald J.G. Jermaine E. Beckell M.A. Harris C.C. Autrup H.N. Human Carcinogenesis. Academic Press, New York1983: 85-96Google Scholar), 24 and 48 h after irradiation with 30 mJ/cm2 (metered at 285 ± 5 nm). UV Irradiation—A solar simulator (Spectral Energy Corporation, Westwood, NJ) housing an appropriately filtered 1 kilowatt xenon arc lamp (XMN 1000–21; Optical Radiation Corp., Azusa, CA) adjusted to 2 × 10–4 watts cm–2 was used to irradiate melanocytes in phosphate-buffered saline through the Petri dish plastic cover. This system delivers a spectral output virtually identical to that of terrestrial sunlight (31Werninghaus K. Handjani R.M. Gilchrest B.A. Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 1991; 8: 236-242PubMed Google Scholar). Dosage was metered at 285 ± 5 nm with a research radiometer (Model IL1700A; Inter-national Light, Inc., Newburyport, MA) fitted with a UVB probe (detector SSE 240, diffuser W, filter UVB). Dose was calculated to contain 20 mJ/cm2 UVB, a dose that is physiologically relevant (3Friedmann P.S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and closely conforms to terrestrial sunlight (31Werninghaus K. Handjani R.M. Gilchrest B.A. Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 1991; 8: 236-242PubMed Google Scholar). Sham-irradiated melanocytes were handled identically but were placed under aluminum foil cover during the irradiation. After irradiation, cells were provided their original medium and were harvested at different intervals after irradiation. Densitometric Analysis—Autoradiograms of Western and Northern blots and PCR reactions were scanned into a computer (PC Dell™). Band intensity was determined after background subtraction using Bio-Rad Gel Doc 1000/2000 imaging densitometer. Normal Human Melanocytes Express BMP Receptor and BMP-4 mRNAs—Total cellular RNA was isolated from melanocyte and keratinocyte cultures. Using sequence-specific primers to BMP-R1A, -1B, and -2 and the PCR technique, only samples of reverse-transcribed melanocyte RNA showed bands at the expected molecular weights for BMP-R1A, -1B, -2, and BMP-4 and keratinocytes for BMP-4 when analyzed by ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel (Fig. 1). The bands were sequenced and identified as BMP-R1A, -1B, -2, and BMP-4, respectively, by comparison to the working draft sequence of the human genome (BLAST). BMP-4 Decreases Melanin Synthesis—Preliminary experiments suggested that 25 ng/ml of BMP-4 decrease melanogenesis. Therefore, subconfluent melanocyte cultures were supplemented with BMP-4 (25 ng/ml). Seventy-two hours after supplementation, proteins were harvested and total melanin/cell was determined. BMP-4 decreased melanin content by 47 ± 15% within 72 h (p < 0.04, n = 5) (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, tyrosinase activity, a reflection of melanin synthesis rate (1Halaban R. Hebert D.N. Fisher D.E. Freedberg I.M. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Austen K.F. Goldsmith L.A. Katz S.I. Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. 1. McGraw-Hill, New York2003: 127-148Google Scholar), was similarly inhibited by BMP-4, yielding a 34.0 ± 9.5% (mean ± S.E.) decreased activity within 72 h after stimulation compared with diluent-treated cells (p < 0.05, n = 3) (Fig. 2B). BMP-4 Down-regulates Tyrosinase mRNA and Protein Levels and Decreases Tyrosinase mRNA Stability—Because tyrosinase is considered the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin biosynthesis (1Halaban R. Hebert D.N. Fisher D.E. Freedberg I.M. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Austen K.F. Goldsmith L.A. Katz S.I. Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. 1. McGraw-Hill, New York2003: 127-148Google Scholar), we investigated BMP-4 effect on tyrosinase mRNA and protein levels. Subconfluent melanocytes were stimulated with 25 ng/ml BMP-4, and the expression of tyrosinase mRNA and protein was determined by Northern and Western blot analyses using tyrosinase cDNA (Fig. 3A) and anti-tyrosinase antibodies (Fig. 3B), respectively. The 2.4-kb band that represents tyrosinase mRNA was strongly expressed in melanocytes treated with diluent alone. However, tyrosinase mRNA level was lower in cultures treated with BMP-4 (42 ± 16%, and 44 ± 17% (mean ± S.E.) at 24 and 48 h, respectively, p < 0.02). Similarly, the 66–68-kDa band representing tyrosinase protein was reduced by BMP-4. In diluent-treated cultures, tyrosinase protein increased with time, consistent with culture maturation. However, tyrosinase levels in BMP-4-treated cultures were lower: 42 ± 20 and 53 ± 29% (mean ± S.E.) of diluent controls at 24 and 48 h, respectively, (p < 0.05), as determined by densitometry. These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of BMP-4 on melanin synthesis is mediated at least in part through inhibition of tyrosinase expression and synthesis. To determine if BMP-4 transcriptionally regulates tyrosinase, BMP-4 effect on a 6.1-kb mouse tyrosinase promoter as well as on three deletion mutations (3.8 kb, 280 bp, and 60 bp) was examined (24Kluppel M. Beermann F. Ruppert S. Schmid E. Hummler E. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3777-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) by transfecting MM4 melanoma cells that, like melanocytes, express BMP-R1A, -1B, and -2 (data not shown). There was no consistent effect of BMP-4 on the activity of the 3.8-kb, 280-bp, and 60-bp promoters (data not shown). However, BMP-4 decreased the activity of the 6.1-kb promoter by 27.4% ± 10.0% (mean ± S.E.) (p < 0.03, Student's paired t test, n = 10) (Fig. 4A). Although a small effect, it is significant, suggesting that BMP-4 effect on tyrosinase is in part transcriptionally mediated. To determine the BMP-4 effect on tyrosinase mRNA stability, melanocytes were stimulated with BMP-4 or diluent in the presence of actinomycin D. BMP-4 decreased tyrosinase mRNA half-life from ≫6 h to 4 h (Fig. 4B). BMP-4 Does Not Induce Melanocyte Apoptosis—To rule out the possibility that BMP-4 effect is the result of cell damage leading to apoptosis of more pigmented cells, melanocytes stimulated with BMP-4 (25 ng/ml) were harvested 48 and 72 h after stimulation and apoptosis was determined. There was no significant difference in the level of cytoplasmic DNA-histone between diluent-treated and BMP-4-treated cells (p = 0.12), while SCC12F cells irradiated with a UV dose of 30mJ/cm2 displayed a significantly higher level of the apoptotic products (p < 0.02), comparable to the manufacturer's positive control (Fig. 5). UV Irradiation Decreases the Expression of BMP-R1B—Because UV irradiation is the major environmental stimulus for melanogenesis (tanning), and UV irradiation of epidermal melanocytes alone can lead to increased melanin synthesis (3Friedmann P.S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of solar-simul"
https://openalex.org/W2018421121,"Heterocyclic arylamines are highly mutagenic and cause tumors in animal models. The mutagenicity is attributed to the C8- and N2-G adducts, the latter of which accumulates due to slower repair. The C8- and N 2-G adducts derived from 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) were placed at the G1 and G3 sites of the NarI sequence, in which the G3 site is an established hot spot for frameshift mutation with the model arylamine derivative 2-acetylaminofluorene but G1 is not. Human DNA polymerase (pol) η extended primers beyond template G-IQ adducts better than did pol κ and much better than pol ι or δ. In 1-base incorporation studies, pol η inserted C and A, pol ι inserted T, and pol κ inserted G. Steady-state kinetic parameters were measured for these dNTPs opposite the C8- and N 2-IQ adducts at both sites, being most favorable for pol η. Mass spectrometry of pol η extension products revealed a single major product in each of four cases; with the G1 and G3 C8-IQ adducts, incorporation was largely error-free. With the G3 N 2-IQ adduct, a –2 deletion occurred at the site of the adduct. With the G1 N 2-IQ adduct, the product was error-free at the site opposite the base and then stalled. Thus, the pol η products yielded frame-shifts with the N 2 but not the C8 IQ adducts. We show a role for pol η and the complexity of different chemical adducts of IQ, DNA position, and DNA polymerases. Heterocyclic arylamines are highly mutagenic and cause tumors in animal models.

The modification of DNA by chemical and physical agents is a common process and leads to loss of genetic stability (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Rev. 2005; 37: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, questions about the chemistry of the damage and the biochemical processing are of particular interest regarding many diseases, as well as basic molecular genetics (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar). Repair of DNA damage is one issue, but another issue is the replication of damaged DNA and the introduction of mutations (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T.

The field has become more complex with the discovery of a plethora of translesion DNA polymerases, some of which appear to have selective functions in replicating damaged DNA (1Friedberg E.C.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Today at least 14 human DNA polymerases are known (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A.

A major general issue is the elucidation of the bases for the selectivity of chemical and physical agents in producing various mutation spectra in individual genes, ultimately a factor in biological outcomes. Several contributors are as follows: (i) reaction of the chemical or physical agent with DNA; (ii) further nonenzymatic reactions of the DNA adduct; (iii) DNA repair (or lack of repair); (iv) the action of DNA polymerases; and (v) the biological effect of a particular mutation in changing the phenotype (3Guengerich F.P.

Res. 1997; 376: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 13Nagao M. Honda M. Seino Y. Yahagi T. Sugimura T. Cancer Lett. 1977; 2: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The heterocyclic amines have chemical (and biochemical) similarity to arylamines, several of which are recognized human carcinogens (14Rehn L. Arch. Clin. Chirgurie. 1895; 50: 588-600Google Scholar, 15Beland F.A. Kadlubar F.F. Environ. Health Perspect. 1985; 62: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Several heterocyclic amines have been shown to be carcinogenic in rodents and non-human primates (16Adamson R.H. Nagao M. Sugimura T. Food Borne Carcinogens Heterocyclic Amines. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK2000: 229-240Google Scholar). Arylamines and the derivative arylacetamides can show strong sequence selectivity in mutational assays. For example, in bacterial systems on adducts derived from AAF, 3The abbreviations used are: AAF, 2-acetylaminofluorene; AF, 2-aminofluorene; CGE, capillary gel electrophoresis; CID, collision-induced dissociation; ES, electrospray; IQ, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline; LC, (high performance) liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; pol, DNA polymerase; UDG, uracil DNA glycosylase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. a strong –2 frameshift (deletion) is seen at the “G3” site of the NarI sequence (GGCGCC), leading to the loss of a GC doublet (17Fuchs R.P. Schwartz N. Daune M.P. Nature. 1981; 294: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Koffel-Schwartz N. Verdier J.M. Bichara M. Freund A.M. Daune M.P. Fuchs R.P. J. Mol.

This phenomenon, which is not observed with the closely related compound AF, has been studied at several structural and biological levels (20Gill J.P. Romano L.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15387-15395Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Mao B. Gu Z. Gorin A. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J.

The basis is more complex than alteration of the DNA structure, in that not only the site within the DNA but also the cellular system influences the biological outcome (23Tan X. Suzuki N. Grollman A.P. Shibutani S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14255-14262Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The NarI “hot spot” was first detected in analysis of the mutation spectrum or AAF (17Fuchs R.P. Schwartz N. Daune M.P. Nature. 1981; 294: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); repetitive sequences have been detected as being prone to frameshift mutagenesis with various systems (18Koffel-Schwartz N. Verdier J.M. Bichara M. Freund A.M. Daune M.P. Fuchs R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 33-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 19Burnouf D. Koehl P. Fuchs R.P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4147-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The position of the adduct within the repetitive NarI sequence has a strong effect on whether mutations occur or not, as shown with AAF (19Burnouf D. Koehl P. Fuchs R.P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4147-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One of the critical issues in the study of the biochemical mechanisms of processing of DNA damage is the ability to prepare specific chemical reagents, particularly DNA adducts. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we have been able to avoid producing mixtures of heterocyclic amine DNA adducts with the use of strategies for synthesis of appropriately modified monomers (24Elmquist C.E. Stover J.S. Wang Z. Rizzo C.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 11189-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Stover J.S. Rizzo C.J. Org.

With this strategy, we were able to synthesize both of the major DNA adducts formed by IQ, the N 2- and C8-guanyl adducts (Fig. 1). Both of these adducts are formed upon reaction of DNA with N-hydroxy IQ (27Turesky R.J. Vouros P. J. Chromatogr. B. 2004; 802: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but the proportion of the N2-IQ adduct increases with time in vivo (in rodents) due to much slower repair (27Turesky R.J. Vouros P. J. Chromatogr. B. 2004; 802: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Turesky R.J. Box R.M. Markovic J. Gremaud E. Snyderwine E.G. Mutat. Res. 1997; 376: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both adducts were positioned at both the G1 and the G3 sites in the NarI sequence, which are known to be resistant and sensitive, respectively, to frameshift mutations with AAF (19Burnouf D. Koehl P. Fuchs R.P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4147-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 29Tebbs R.S. Romano L.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8998-9006Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The modified oligonucleotides were used in studies with purified recombinant human DNA polymerases, including the replicative pol δ-PCNA complex and the major translesion polymerases pol η, ι, and κ. Analysis included primer extension in the presence of all four dNTPs, steady-state kinetic analysis of single dNTP insertion, and LC-MS/MS sequencing analysis of the full-length extension products. The results show that pol δ is completely blocked by the IQ adducts and that pol η is the most efficient of the translesion DNA polymerases in copying. pol η exhibited different behavior with both of the two IQ adducts at each of the two internal NarI sites. In particular, the N2-IQ adduct (with pol η) yielded only the –2 deletion product at the G3 site, which was not observed with the C8-IQ adduct. The selectivity of pol η for the site-specific lesions is striking and correlates not only to the NarI G3 frameshift seen in bacteria but also a prominent GC deletion seen in several tissues of rats treated with IQ (30Bol S.A.M.

Recombinant human PCNA was prepared in Escherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere (34Fien K. Stillman B. Mol.

The manufacturer's standard synthesis protocol was followed except at the incorporation of the modified phosphoramidites, which was accomplished manually, off-line. At this point, the column was removed from the instrument and sealed with two syringes, one of which contained 250–300 μl of the manufacturer's 1H-tetrazole activator solution (1.9–4.0% in CH3CN, w/v) and the other contained 250 μl of the phosphoramidite (15 mg, 98 mm in anhydrous CH2Cl2). The 1H-tetrazole and the phosphoramidite solutions were sequentially drawn through the column (1H-tetrazole first), and this procedure was repeated periodically over 30 min. After this time, the column was washed with manufacturer's grade anhydrous CH3CN and returned to the instrument for the capping, oxidation, and detritylation steps. The remainder of the synthesis was carried out in the usual manner.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this study19-mer5′-GGGGGCTCGTAAGGATTGG22-mer5′-GGGGGCTCGTAAGGATTGGCGC27-mer3′-CCCCCGAGCATTCCTAACCG3 *CG2G1 *CTCA Open table in a new tab HPLC—HPLC analyses and purifications were performed on a Beckman HPLC system with a UV diode array detector (model 166) monitored at 254 nm and utilizing 32 Karat software (version 3.1). The oligonucleotides were purified by using a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, solvent 1) and CH3OH (solvent 2). The solvent gradient was as follows: initially 99% solvent 1 (v/v), then a 27.5-min linear gradient to 35% solvent 1 (v/v); a 2.5-min linear gradient to 50% solvent 1 (v/v) followed by 5-min isocratic at 50% solvent 1 (v/v), and then a 5-min linear gradient to initial conditions. CGE—Electrophoretic analyses were carried out using a Beckman P/ACE Instrument System 5500 Series system, monitored at 260 nm. The P/ACE MDQ instrument used a 31.2 cm × 100 μm eCAP capillary with samples applied at 10 kV and run at 9 kV. The column was packed with the manufacturer's 100-R gel (for single-stranded DNA) using a Tris borate buffer system containing 7.0 m urea. CGE electrophoretograms of all modified oligonucleotides are presented in supplemental Figs. S1–S4. MALDI-TOF Sequencing of Oligonucleotides—MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the four intact IG-containing templates are presented in supplemental Figs. S1–S4. MALDI-TOF MS sequencing of modified oligonucleotides (36Tretyakova N. Matter B. Ogdie A. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was performed by treatment of purified oligonucleotides (0.3 A260 units, based on 1-ml volume) in an ammonium hydrogen citrate buffer (pH 9.4) with 2 milliunits of phosphodiesterase I. Aliquots of 4 μl were taken before enzyme addition and at 1-, 8-, 18-, 28-, and 38-min time points and added sequentially to the same vial, which was kept frozen on dry ice. A second DNA aliquot (0.3 A260 units in 24 μl of 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.6)) was treated with 2 milliunits of phosphodiesterase II, and aliquots of 4 μl were taken in the same manner. The two digest mixtures were desalted using Millipore C18 Ziptips and eluted directly onto a MALDI plate in 3-hydroxypicolinic acid-containing ammonium hydrogen citrate (7 mg ml–1). MALDI-TOF analysis allowed sequential identification of nucleotides from the 3′ end of the sequence for the phosphodiesterase I-treated sample and from the 5′ end for the phosphodiesterase II-treated sample. Both phosphodiesterase treatments confirmed the expected positions of the G1 and G3 site adducts in the synthetic templates containing C8- and N2-IQ (data not presented). Reaction Conditions for Enzyme Assays—Unless indicated otherwise, standard DNA polymerase reactions were done in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin ml–1 (w/v), and 10% glycerol (v/v) with 100 nm primer-template at 37 °C. Primers (19- or 22-mer) were 5′ end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase/[γ-32P]ATP and annealed with templates (27-mers). All reactions were initiated by the addition of dNTP solutions containing MgCl2 (5 mm final concentration) to preincubated enzyme/DNA mixtures. Primer Extension Assay with All Four dNTPs (“Run-on” or “Standing Start” Experiments)—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or modified (N 2-IQ G or C8-IQ G) template, was extended in the presence of all four dNTPs (100 μm each) for 15 min. Reaction mixtures (8 μl) were quenched with 10 volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v). Products were resolved using a 16% (w/v) PAGE system containing 8 m urea and visualized using a Molecular Imager (model FX) and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Steady-state Kinetic Analyses—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, was extended in the presence of varying concentrations of a single dNTP. The molar ratio of primer-template complex to enzyme was at least 10:1, except for the adducted templates with pol κ and pol ι (molar ratio of 5–30:1). Polymerase concentrations and reaction times were chosen so that maximal product formation was ≤20% of the substrate concentration. The reactions with the modified oligonucleotides were relatively slow, as shown with the results (which are typical for studies in this field). The primer-template complex was extended with each dNTP in the presence of 0.1–20 nm enzyme for 10 min. All reactions (8 μl, done at 10 dNTP concentrations) were quenched with 10 volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v). Products were resolved using a 16% polyacrylamide (w/v) electrophoresis gel containing 8 m urea and quantitated with PhosphorImaging analysis using a Molecular Imager FX instrument and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Graphs of product formation versus dNTP concentration were fit using nonlinear regression (hyperbolic fits) in GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (GraphPad, San Diego) for the estimation of kcat and Km values. LC-MS/MS Analysis of Oligonucleotide Products from pol η Reactions—pol η reactions were performed for 6 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin ml–1, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (200 μl total reaction mixture). The reactions were done with all four dNTPs at 1 mm each, 5 μm oligonucleotide substrate, and pol η concentrations of 1.25–2.5 μm. The reactions were terminated by extracting the dNTPs using a spin column (Bio-Spin 6, Bio-Rad). The initial concentrations of Tris-HCl, EDTA, and dithiothreitol were restored in the above filtrate, and 15 units of E. coli UDG was added to the mixtures. The reactions were allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 4 h. Piperidine was added to the reaction mixtures (to 0.25 m), which were heated at 95 °C for 1 h followed by lyophilization. The residues were dissolved in a 70-μl volume for LC-MS/MS analysis. For most of the experiments, MS analysis was performed in the Vanderbilt facility on a DecaXP ion trap instrument (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), using the general methods described earlier (37Ni J.

Samples were injected using an autosampler, with 10 μl withdrawn from the reaction mixture. The mixtures were separated on a Jupiter microbore column (1.0 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Buffer A contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 (pH 6.8) and 2% CH3CN (v/v). Buffer B contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 (pH 6.8) and 98% CH3CN (v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml min–1, and the gradient was as follows: 0–2 min, hold at 100% A; 2–20 min, linear program to 100% B; 20–30 min, hold at 100% B; 30–32 min, linear program to 100% A; 32–40 min, hold at 100% A (for next injection). Oligonucleotides eluted at tR 9–12 min. Electrospray conditions (negative ion) were as follows: source voltage 3.4 kV, source current 8.5 μA, sheath gas flow rate setting 28.2, auxiliary sweep gas flow rate setting 4.3, capillary voltage 49 V, capillary temperature 230 °C, tube lens voltage 67 V. MS/MS settings were as follows: normalized collision energy 35%, activation Q 0.250, time 30 min, 1 scan. Product ion spectra were acquired over the range m/z 300–2000. The most abundant ions were selected for CID analysis. The calculations of the CID fragmentations of a certain oligonucleotide sequence were done using a program from the Mass Spectrometry Group of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Utah. In the case of the sequence analysis of pol η-catalyzed full-length extension products across the C8-IQ adduct at the G1 position, the initial analysis was equivocal, and subsequent LC-MS/MS was performed on a Waters Acquit HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA) connected to a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (thermoelectric) using an Acuity HPLC BE C18 column (1.7 μm, 1.0 mm × 100 mm). LC conditions were as follows: buffer A contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 plus 2% CH3CN (v/v), and buffer B contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 plus 95% CH3CN (v/v). The following gradient program was used with a flow rate of 150 μl min–1: 0–3 min, linear gradient from 100% A to 97% A; 3–4.5 min, linear gradient to 80% A; 4.5–5 min, linear gradient 100% B; 5–5.5 min, hold at 100% B; 5.5–6.5 min, linear gradient to 100% A; 6.5–9.5 min, hold at % A. The temperature of the column was maintained at 50 °C. Samples (10 μl) were infused with an autosampler. ES conditions were as follows: source voltage 4 kV, source current 100 μA, auxiliary gas flow rate setting 20, sweep gas flow rate setting 5, sheath gas flow setting 34, capillary voltage –49 V, capillary temperature 350 °C, tube lens voltage –90 V. MS/MS conditions were as follows: normalized collision energy 35%, activation Q 0.250, and activation time 30 ms. Product ion spectra were acquired over the range m/z 345–2000. The triply charged species (m/z 1152.7) were used for CID analysis. The calculations of the CID fragmentations of oligonucleotide sequences were also done using a program linked to the Mass Spectrometry Group of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Utah. Extension of Primers Opposite C8- and N2-IQ Adducts in Templates—Initial studies were done with all four dNTPs using each of the human DNA polymerases available (δ, η, ι, and κ). Comparisons were made with the templates containing the C8- and N2-IQ adducts at the G1 and G3 positions, with the cognate primers (Figs. 2 and 3).FIGURE 3Extension of 2P-labeled primer paired with a 27-mer template containing G or N2-IQ G. A, 32P-labeled 22-mer was annealed with a 27-mer containing G or N2-IQ G at position 23 (G1). B, 32P-labeled 19-mer was annealed with a 27-mer containing G or N2-IQ G at position 20 (G3). All incubations were done for 15 min with 100 nm primer-template and the indicated concentration of the polymerase in the presence of all four dNTPs. PCNA (400 nm) was present in the case of pol δ. The lengths of the bands are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) pol δ, in the presence of PCNA, readily extended the primers opposite the unmodified template but was totally blocked by either IQ adduct at both the G1 or G3 positions (Figs. 2 and 3). As expected, the translesion polymerases (η, ι, and κ) extended the primer opposite the unmodified template but with more less than full-length products due to their distributive character. pol η extended the primer opposite the C8-IQ adduct at the G1 or G3 position, although apparently better at G1 (Fig. 2). Extension also occurred opposite the N2-IQ adduct at both the G1 and G3 sites, although the products appeared to be less than full-length (Fig. 3). The latter phenomenon could be due to a lack of ability to read completely through or to deletions (see below). Both pol ι and κ showed very limited ability to catalyze primer extension opposite the templates with the C8- or the N2-IQ adduct (Figs. 2 and 3). Only with the N2-IQ adduct (both G1 and G3 sites) was any extension beyond a single residue seen (with pol κ) (Fig. 3). Steady-state Kinetics of 1-Base Incorporation into Primers Opposite C8- and N2-IQ Adducts—The steady-state kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and particularly kcat/Km provide a rough quantitative estimate of the ability of polymerases to insert bases opposite an adduct. A misincorporation factor, f (=(kcat/Km)wrong dNTP/(kcat/Km)dCTP), provides an index of the tendency to misincorporate for comparisons (39Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments indicated that the dominant incorporations opposite both the C8- and N2-IQ adducts were polymerase-dependent as follows: C and A for pol η, C and T for pol ι, and C and G for pol κ (Tables 1 and 2). The activity with pol δ was too low to measure (Figs. 2 and 3). The efficiencies of insertion (kcat/Km) were 1–4 orders of magnitude lower than for insertion of dCTP opposite G, depending on the particular system. dCTP insertion was preferred to other dNTPs in all but two cases (f > 1), both with pol ι (Tables 2 and 3). Of the various insertions (C8- and N2-IQ adducts at G1 and G3 sites), the efficiency of pol η insertion of dCTP was the most efficient for the adducts in all cases.TABLE 2Steady-state kinetic parameters for 1-base incorporation opposite G1 by human pol η, ι, and κPolymeraseTemplatedNTPKmkcatkcat/Kmf(misinsertion frequency)μms-1mm-1 s-1pol ηdG1C1.7 ± 0.20.12 ± 0.004711A240 ± 500.037 ± 0.0020.150.0021dG1-C8-IQC19 ± 20.18 ± 0.0049.51A120 ± 100.011 ± 0.00030.0920.0097dG1-N2-IQC42 ± 60.028 ± 0.0010.681A85 ± 100.041 ± 0.0010.480.71pol ιdG1C99 ± 110.33 ± 0.013.31T220 ± 400.23 ± 0.0110.3dG1-C8-IQC690 ± 700.00022 ± 0.000010.00031T460 ± 1000.00032 ± 0.000020.00062dG1-N2-IQC77 ± 110.0025 ± 0.000010.0321T100 ± 200.0018 ± 0.00010.0180.56pol κdG1C68 ± 120.089 ± 0.0051.31G400 ± 500.0041 ± 0.00020.0100.0077dG1-C8-IQC360 ± 500.0068 ± 0.00030.0191G140 ± 400.00013 ± 0.000010.00090.047dG1-N2-IQC65 ± 240.014 ± 0.0010.221G270 ± 400.00015 ± 0.000010.00050.0023 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Steady-state kinetic parameters for one-base incorporation opposite G3 by human pols η, ι, and κPolymeraseTemplatedNTPKmkcatkcat/Kmf(misinsertion frequency)μms-1mm-1 s-1pol ηdG3C6.1 ± 0.50.12 ± 0.00319.71A230 ± 400.074 ± 0.0040.320.016dG3-C8-IQC68 ± 100.036 ± 0.0010.531A120 ± 200.027 ± 0.0010.230.43dG3-N2-IQC46 ± 90.11 ± 0.012.41A510 ± 600.051 ± 0.0020"
https://openalex.org/W2039446946,"The glutamate receptor δ2 (GluRδ2) is predominantly expressed at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell postsynapses and plays crucial roles in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Although the mechanism by which GluRδ2 functions remains unclear, its lack of channel activity and its role in controlling the endocytosis of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors have suggested that GluRδ2 may convey signals by interacting with intracellular signaling molecules. Among several proteins that interact with GluRδ2, delphilin is unique in that it is selectively expressed at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses and that, in addition to a single PDZ domain, it contains a formin homology domain that is thought to regulate actin dynamics. Here, we report a new isoform of delphilin, designated as L-delphilin, that has alternatively spliced N-terminal exons encoding an additional PDZ domain. Although original delphilin, designated S-delphilin, was palmitoylated at the N terminus, this region was spliced out in L-delphilin. As a result, S-delphilin was associated with plasma membranes in COS cells and dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons, whereas L-delphilin formed clusters in soma and dendritic shafts. In addition, S-delphilin, but not L-delphilin, facilitated the expression of GluRδ2 on the cell surface. These results indicate that, like PSD-95 and GRIP/ABP, delphilin isoforms with differential palmitoylation and clustering capabilities may provide two separate intracellular and surface GluRδ2 pools and may control GluRδ2 signaling in Purkinje cells.

Numerous spontaneous ataxic mutant mice occur as a result of null mutations in the gene encoding glutamate receptor δ2 (GluRδ2), 2The abbreviations used are: GluRδ2, δ2 glutamate receptor; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK293 cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; PSD, postsynaptic density; LTD, long-term depression; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PF, parallel fiber. a member of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family that is predominantly expressed at parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum (1Zhao H.M. Wenthold R.J. Wang Y.X. Petralia R.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Detailed morphological and electrophysiological analyses on GluRδ2-null mice suggest that GluRδ2 plays a crucial role in aligning and maintaining the postsynaptic density (PSD) with the presynaptic element at PF-Purkinje cell synapses (for reviews, see Ref. 2Yuzaki M. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 46: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, long-term depression (LTD) of PF-Purkinje cell transmission, which is thought to underlie a form of information storage in the cerebellum (3Ito M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), is completely blunted in GluRδ2-null Purkinje cells (4Kashiwabuchi N. Ikeda K. Araki K. Hirano T. Shibuki K. Takayama C. Inoue Y. Kutsuwada T. Yagi T. Kang Y. Aizawa S. Mishina M. Cell. 1995; 81: 245-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that LTD is caused by an activity-dependent decrease in the number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors (5Matsuda S. Launey T. Mikawa S. Hirai H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 6Wang Y.T. Linden D.J. Neuron. 2000; 25: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the application of an antibody specific for the extracellular region of GluRδ2 to cultured Purkinje cells induced the endocytosis of AMPA receptors in Purkinje cells and abrogated subsequent LTD (7Hirai H. Launey T. Mikawa S. Torashima T. Yanagihara D. Kasaura T. Miyamoto A. Yuzaki M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These results indicate that GluRδ2 plays another unique role at PF-Purkinje cell synapses, the regulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptor endocytosis. However, the mechanisms by which GluRδ2 plays these roles remain unclear; GluRδ2 does not contribute to normal excitatory postsynaptic currents (8Kano M. Kato M. Nature. 1987; 325: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Excitatory synapses, in particular their PSDs, contain many PDZ domain-containing proteins that interact with postsynaptic receptor channels. It is becoming increasingly clear that PDZ proteins control not only the spatial localization of the receptors but also their intracellular signaling pathways by accumulating specific signaling complexes near the receptors. For example, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-induced excitotoxicity was greatly reduced without affecting NMDA receptor-mediated currents by disrupting the neuronal NR2B-PSD-95-nitric oxide synthase interaction (9Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Science. 1999; 284: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Thus, the analysis of PDZ proteins that interact with GluRδ2, such as PSD-93 (10Roche K.W. Ly C.D. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3926-3934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PTPMEG (11Hironaka K. Umemori H. Tezuka T. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16167-16173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), shank (12Uemura T. Mori H. Mishina M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2004; 26: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and delphilin (13Miyagi Y. Yamashita T. Fukaya M. Sonoda T. Okuno T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Nagashima Y. Aoki I. Okuda K. Mishina M. Kawamoto S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 803-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is expected to provide clues to the function of GluRδ2. Of these PDZ proteins, delphilin is unique in that it is selectively expressed at PF-Purkinje cells (13Miyagi Y. Yamashita T. Fukaya M. Sonoda T. Okuno T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Nagashima Y. Aoki I. Okuda K. Mishina M. Kawamoto S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 803-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that in addition to a PDZ domain it contains a formin homology domain, which is thought to control actin dynamics with profilin, and a tyrosine kinase Src. Here, we report a new isoform of delphilin, designated as L-delphilin, which we found while analyzing delphilin signaling. L-delphilin has alternatively spliced N-terminal exons encoding an additional PDZ domain but lacking the N-terminal palmitoylation site found in the original delphilin (designated as S-delphilin). L-delphilin was localized differently from S-delphilin in heterologous cells and neurons. In addition, the two isoforms showed different capabilities of clustering and maintaining GluRδ2 on the cell surface. The presence of isoforms with differential palmitoylation and clustering capabilities is analogous to other important PDZ proteins, such as ABP/GRIP for AMPA receptors (14DeSouza S. Fu J. States B.A. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3493-3503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PSD-95 (15Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and may point to the central role of delphilin in modulating GluRδ2 signaling in Purkinje cells. cDNA Cloning and Sequence Analysis—Exon-intron boundaries and splicing variants of delphilin were examined by applying NetGene2 (The Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark) to the mouse genome data base. The predicted cDNA for L-delphilin was cloned as two fragments that overlapped by 450 bp. The primers used for reverse transcription PCR were as follows: 5′-ATG CCA GCC ACC AAT CAA GGC TG-3′ and 5′-AAG AGG CCC TCA GGG AAC TC-3′ for the first fragment and 5′-CAC CCC CCG TCT TAG TAT AGA C-3′ and 5′-GCA GTA AAC ACC TGC TCC TTG G-3′ for the second fragment. Total RNA from adult mouse cerebellum was prepared using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA); the total RNA was then treated with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) and converted to cDNA by RetroScript reverse transcriptase (Ambion). PCR was performed using a GeneAmp9600 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with TaqDNA polymerase (QiaTaq; Qiagen) according to the following schedule: 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 32 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The absence of genomic DNA contamination was confirmed by performing the same reaction with equivalent amounts of total RNA without reverse transcription. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into a pCR2.1 vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. These fragments and conventional delphilin cDNA were combined using overlapping PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to obtain a full-length cDNA clone. By comparing genome DNA sequences, the human, dog, and rat L-delphilin cDNA sequences were also deduced. The nucleotide sequence data for mouse L-delphilin can be found in GenBank™ under accession number DQ193535. Multiple amino acid sequences of the PDZ domains were aligned using the ClustalW program in the Biology WorkBench suites (Computational Biology Group, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) by applying a Gonnet series matrix, a gap-open penalty of 10.0, and a gap-extension penalty of 0.20. Protein data base accession numbers of the sequences used for alignment are AAG31020 (S-delphilin), NP_062212 (RSG12), and NP_062567 (PSD-95). Analysis of L-delphilin mRNA Expression—Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and an Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen). Two micrograms of each poly(A)+ RNA/lane were separated in a denaturing gel and blotted onto BrightStarPlus Positively Charged Nylon Membrane (Ambion). [32P]UTP riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription of amplified DNA products containing the T7 polymerase promoter sequence flanking the desired nucleotide primer using a Strip-EZ RNA T7 kit (Ambion). The following PCR primers were used: for an L-delphilin-specific probe, 5′-CTG AGG TTG TCC AGG ACT GG-3′ and 5′-ATG CCA GCC ACC AAT CAA GGC-3′; for an S-delphilin-specific probe, 5′-TCC CTA GGC AGC TCA TGG TG-3′ and 5′-GTA TTT GAG GAA ATT CCT GGT G-3′; for a common probe, 5′-AAG AGG CCC TCA GGG AAC TC-3′ and 5′-GCA ACA AGA GTT TCG GCT TCA C-3′. The products were hybridized using an ULTRAhyb ultrasensitive hybridization buffer (Ambion) and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Construction and Transfection of Expression Plasmids—We used a modified overlap extension method and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) to add cDNA encoding hemagglutinin (HA) or FLAG to the 3′ end of the wild-type and mutant delphilin cDNAs (delphilin-HA or delphilin-FLAG); these sequences were added immediately upstream of the stop codon. We also added cDNA encoding an HA or FLAG tag to the 5′ end of the wild-type GluRδ2 cDNAs (NT-FLAG-δ2 or NT-HA-δ2); these sequences were added to the 3′ end of the signal sequence. The cDNAs were cloned into expression vectors pCAGGS (provided by Dr. J. Miyazaki, Tohoku University, Japan) and transfected to cultured hippocampal neurons using Effectene (Qiagen) as previously described (16Matsuda K. Fletcher M. Kamiya Y. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10064-10073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection into HEK293 or COS cells was performed using CellPhect (Amersham Biosciences) or Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen), respectively. Production of L-delphilin-specific Antibody and Immunoblot Analysis—The synthetic peptide DDILGDRLTAKEQVFTALKQ, which corresponds to amino acids 134 through 153 in L-delphilin, was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Rabbits were immunized with 0.5 mg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin-peptide conjugate in a complete Freund's adjuvant and were given three booster immunizations at 1-week intervals with 0.25 mg of conjugate in an incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Antiserum was purified using an affinity-Sepharose column coupled with the antigenic peptide. To confirm the specificity of the antibody, HEK293 cells expressing L- or S-delphilin were solubilized in TNE buffer (50 mm NaF, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm EDTA, 1 μm pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and an immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (17Matsuda S. Yuzaki M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An immunoprecipitation assay was performed by adding 2 μg of purified anti-L-delphilin antibody, anti-GluRδ2 antibody (against amino acids 852-903; provided by Dr. M. Watanabe, Hokkaido university, Japan), or rabbit IgG to the cerebellar lysates in TNE buffer as previously described (17Matsuda S. Yuzaki M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Production of GST Fusion Protein and Pulldown Assay—An expression vector for a GST fusion protein with a GluRδ2 C terminus region corresponding to amino acids 837-849 (GST-δ2) was constructed in pGEX 4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion protein was produced in Escherichia Coli strain BL21 in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 18°C. E. coli was collected, sonicated, and solubilized in 2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The GST-δ2 fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), resulting in GST-δ2-Sepharose beads. Cell lysate from transfected HEK293 cells with the indicated delphilin-HA expression vectors were incubated overnight with these GST-δ2-Sepharose beads. After being washed with TNE buffer and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, the bound delphilin-HA was detected using Western blot analysis. Metabolic Labeling for Analysis of Palmitoylation—At 36 h after transfection, the HEK293 cells were pretreated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3 μg/ml cerulein and 10 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 30 min. [3H]Palmitic acid at 0.5 mCi/ml (50 Ci/mmol) was added to the culture, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, collected in tubes, and lysed with TNE buffer. The soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) or anti-PSD-95 (UpState, Charlottesville, VA) antibody as previously described (17Matsuda S. Yuzaki M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitants were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol but containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. After SDS-PAGE, the gels were fixed in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 20 min, dried in a heat vacuum, and exposed to an imaging plate (Fujifilm Life Science) for 3 days. One-twentieth of each sample was used in an immunoblot analysis to examine the protein expression level. For hydroxylamine treatment, duplicate gels were incubated with 1 m hydroxylamine or Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, for 18 h before exposure to the imaging plate. Cell Surface Biotinylation Assays—pCAGGS vectors expressing NT-FLAG-δ2 and delphilin-HA (or EGFP) were co-transfected at the ratio of 1:4 into HEK293 cells. 36-48 h later, cell surface biotinylation was carried out by using EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 15 min as previously described (16Matsuda K. Fletcher M. Kamiya Y. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10064-10073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After solubilization with TNE buffer, cell lysates were precipitated by NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) and subjected to the immunoblot analysis using anti-GluRδ2 antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). 20% of surface proteins (captured with NeutrAvidin beads) and 2% of total lysates were used to calculate the surface GluRδ2 ratio. Immunocytochemical Analysis of Transfected Cells and Neurons—COS cells expressing delphilin and/or GluRδ2 were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature 24-36 h after transfection. Cultured hippocampal neurons (16Matsuda K. Fletcher M. Kamiya Y. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10064-10073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were transfected at 3 days in vitro and fixed at 14-21 days in vitro. To visualize the transfected neurons, pCAGGS expressing delphilin cDNA and pCAGGS expressing EGFP (pCAGGS-EGFP) were transfected at a ratio of 5:1. Sindbis virus was also used to express proteins in a large number of hippocampal neurons in culture. The cDNA encoding HA-tagged delphilin was cloned into a pSin-Rep5 vector (Invitrogen), and virus particles were produced according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day after the addition of the virus particles, the hippocampal neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, the cells were incubated with blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 2% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature and were then incubated with the primary antibodies for an additional 1 h at the following dilutions: rat anti-HA, 1:1000 (Roche Applied Science); mouse anti-PSD-95, 1:1000 (UpState); rabbit anti-MAP2, 1:1000 (Chemicon); chicken anti-GFP, 1:5000 (Chemicon); rabbit anti-GluRδ2, 1:1000 (Chemicon); and mouse anti-FLAG, 1:1000 (Sigma). For visualization, appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 546 or 488 (diluted at 1:2000; Invitrogen) were used. For cell surface staining, the cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS-delphilin-FLAG and pCAGGS-NT-HA-δ2 at a ratio of 4:1. After fixation for 10 min at 4 °C, the cells were incubated with blocking buffer without Triton X-100 and then incubated with mouse anti-HA antibody (1:1000; Covance Research Products Inc., Denver, PA). An HA tag on the N terminus of GluRδ2 on the cell surface was visualized by incubating the cells with Alexa 546 anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:2000; Invitrogen) for 1 h. The cells were then permeabilized with blocking buffer containing 0.4% TritonX-100 for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with anti-L-delphilin (1:500). L-delphilin was visualized by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 (1:2000; Invitrogen). No fluorescence was observed when each of the secondary antibodies was omitted, confirming the specific excitation of each fluorescent substance. To determine the number of cells that formed intracellular clusters of delphilin isoforms or its mutants (see Fig. 5A), a total of 20-30 randomly chosen fields/coverslip were counted using ×200 magnification under a fluorescence microscope in a double-blind manner. Cloning of Alternatively Spliced N-terminal Form of Delphilin—Previous studies have suggested that the functions of several PDZ proteins, like ABP and PSD-95, are crucially controlled by alternative splicing at their N termini (14DeSouza S. Fu J. States B.A. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3493-3503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because delphilin transcription results in a major (∼9 kb) band and a minor (∼4 kb) band when examined using Northern blot analysis (13Miyagi Y. Yamashita T. Fukaya M. Sonoda T. Okuno T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Nagashima Y. Aoki I. Okuda K. Mishina M. Kawamoto S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 803-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the possibility of alternative splicing at the extreme N terminus of delphilin. An analysis of mouse genomic data bases revealed that delphilin is encoded by 21 exons and that all the exon-intron junctions are identical to canonical splice donor and acceptor sites (Fig. 1A). In addition, at 5,500 bp upstream of the original first exon (Fig. 1A, S1), we found an additional putative exon (Fig. 1A, L1) that could potentially encode a PDZ domain. To examine whether a transcript with an additional PDZ domain was expressed in vivo,we performed reverse transcription PCR on mouse cerebellar cDNA using a primer set designed at exons L1 and 8 (Fig. 1A, arrows). We obtained a single PCR amplicon (∼1.5 kbp) whose sequence was coded by exon L1 and exons 2 through 8 (Fig. 1A). The transcript lacked the original exon S1; instead, it included another short exon L1′ (Fig. 1A). Exons L1 and L1′ also encoded a leucine-rich short sequence, which we have referred to as a linker (Fig. 1C). We detected a translation initiation signal in exon L1 compatible with the Kozak sequence and an in-frame termination codon at 200 bp upstream of this initiation signal. The exon-intron junctions of exons L1 and L1′ were identical to canonical splice donor and acceptor sites (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that the delphilin gene was alternatively spliced at the N terminus to generate a variant transcript from exons L1 and L1′, instead of exon S1. As a result, the new transcript contained an additional 184 amino acids at its N terminus and encoded a new PDZ domain, designated PDZ1, plus a linker domain in addition to the original PDZ domain, designated PDZ2 (Fig. 1C). We designated this longer form of delphilin as L-delphilin and the original form as S-delphilin. Analysis of human, dog, and rat genomic DNA data bases revealed that similar putative exons encoding a PDZ domain were conserved in the corresponding 5′ upstream regions of the delphilin genes (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the PDZ1 domain encoded by exons L1 and L1′ was functionally important for delphilin. The PDZ1 domain of delphilin contained a conserved PDZ ligand binding motif (Φ-G-Φ, where Φ is a hydrophobic residue) between the putative βA and βB strands (Fig. 2B). In addition, the first residue of the putative helix αB of the PDZ1 domain, as well as that of the PDZ2 domain, was arginine (Fig. 2B), which is conserved among class I PDZ domains (18Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Indeed, of the known PDZ proteins, the PDZ1 domain was most similar to the PDZ domain of regulators of G-protein signaling12 (RGS12; 42% identical and 32% similar amino acids by BLAST), followed by the PDZ2 domain of delphilin itself (33% identical and 53% similar amino acids; Fig. 2B). The PDZ domain of RGS12 and the PDZ2 domain of delphilin have been reported to bind to the C terminus of the G-protein-coupled receptor CXCR2 (19Snow B.E. Hall R.A. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Bouchard D. Brothers C.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Gilman A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Siderovski D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and the C terminus of GluRδ2 (13Miyagi Y. Yamashita T. Fukaya M. Sonoda T. Okuno T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Nagashima Y. Aoki I. Okuda K. Mishina M. Kawamoto S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 803-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, via class I interactions. Similarly, we found that L-delphilin specifically interacted with the C terminus of GluRδ2 (Fig. 2C) via both PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains (Fig. 2, D and E). These results suggested that the PDZ1 domain of L-delphilin encodes a functional class I PDZ domain. Expression of L-delphilin in the Cerebellum—To confirm the expression of L-delphilin in vivo, we performed a Northern blot analysis on mRNAs prepared from adult cerebral cortex and cerebellum using specific probes. A probe common to L-delphilin and S-delphilin detected a major ∼9-kb band (black arrow heads) and a minor ∼4-kb band (open circle) in the cerebellum (Fig. 3A), consistent with earlier reports (13Miyagi Y. Yamashita T. Fukaya M. Sonoda T. Okuno T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Nagashima Y. Aoki I. Okuda K. Mishina M. Kawamoto S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 803-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a probe specific to L-delphilin (exons L1 and L1′) detected a major ∼9-kb band and a minor ∼4-kb band in the cerebellum, but not in the cerebral cortex (Fig. 3A). In contrast, although a probe specific to S-delphilin (exon S1) also reacted with a ∼9-kb band, the signal in the cerebral cortex was stronger than that in the cerebellum (Fig. 3A). An additional ∼6-kb band detected by this probe may reflect a nonspecific hybridization, as this band was not detected by the common probe. These results indicated that L-delphilin was indeed expressed in vivo and that L-delphilin did not contain exon S1. In addition, because S-delphilin did not exhibit the cerebellum-dominant expression pattern observed with the common probe, L-delphilin may be the predominant isoform. Alternatively, other major splicing variants at the N terminus that could not be detected with the probe used for S-delphilin may exist. To further confirm the expression of the L-delphilin protein in the cerebellum, we generated a specific anti-L-delphilin antibody using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the unique region of L-delphilin. An immunoblot analysis of HEK293 cells expressing L-delphilin-HA or S-delphilin-HA showed that this anti-L-delphilin antibody recognized a protein of ∼150 kDa, which agrees with the predicted molecular mass of L-delphilin (Fig. 3B, upper left panel). After preabsorption with the antigen peptide, the anti-L-delphilin antibody no longer recognized this band (data not shown). In addition, the antibody did not react with S-delphilin-HA protein, whereas anti-HA antibody detected both S- and L-delphilin proteins (Fig. 3B, upper right panel). These results confirmed the specificity of the anti-L-delphilin antibody. Immunoblot analysis of cerebellar lysates immunoprecipitated by this antibody, but not by IgG, also specifically reacted with an ∼150-kDa protein (Fig. 3B, lower left panel). After pre-absorption with the antigen peptide, the anti-L-delphilin antibody no longer recognized this band (Fig. 3B, lower right panel). These results indicated that L-delphilin was indeed translated from mRNA and associated with native GluRδ2 in adult mouse cerebellum. Palmitoylation of S-delphilin Is Necessary for the Cell Surface Expression of GluRδ2—Exon S1, which is spliced out in L-delphilin, encodes an S-delphilin-specific peptide, MSCLG (Fig. 1C), at the extreme N terminus. As the cysteine residue at the third position is flanked by hydrophobic residues (Fig. 4A), this sequence may constitute the palmitoylation site, which regulates the binding of adaptor proteins to the plasma membrane and trafficking to postsynaptic regions (14DeSouza S. Fu J. States B.A. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3493-3503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 21van't Hof W. Resh M.D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Indeed, the sequence around this region is reminiscent of the N terminus of PSD-95α and GAP-43 (Fig. 4A), which are known to undergo palmitoylation (14DeSouza S. Fu J. States B.A. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3493-3503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In contrast, L-delphilin does not contain the corresponding cysteine residue for the putative palmitoylation site. To test the hypothesis that delphilin isoforms are differentially palmitoylated, HEK293 cells expressing L-delphilin-HA or S-delphilin-HA were incubated with [3H]palmitate and the cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The level of palmitoylation was visualized by fluorography, and the amount of each protein was assessed by immunoblot analysis with anti-HA antibody. Like PSD-95α, S-delphilin was clearly palmitoylated, whereas S-delphilin whose third cysteine residue was replaced by alanine (S-del-C3A) and L-delphilin were not (Fig. 4B). When duplicate gels were treated with 1 m Tris-HCl or 1 m hydroxylamine overnight, the [3H]palmitate signals of PSD-95α and S-delphilin disappeared (Fig. 4C). These results further confirmed that PSD-95α and S-delphilin were palmitoylated via the thioester bond. Although delphilin is reported to associate with GluRδ2, its function remains unclear. Because one of the roles of PDZ domain proteins is to enhance the expression of its associated membrane receptors on the cell surface, we expressed GluRδ2 with or without delphilin in HEK293 cells. 24-36 h after transfection, HEK293 cells we"

Transformation of the yeast ergosterol auxotroph erg26 mutant, which lacks 3βHSD/D activity, with the At3βHSD/D1 isoform or with At3βHSD/D2 isoform containing a C-terminal At3βHSD/D1 endoplasmic reticulum-retrieval sequence restored growth and ergosterol synthesis in erg26. An in vitro enzymatic assay revealed high 3βHSD/D activity for both isoenzymes in the corresponding microsomal extracts. The two At3βHSD/D isoenzymes showed similar substrate specificities that required free 3β-hydroxyl and C-4-carboxyl groups but were quite tolerant in terms of variations of the sterol nucleus and side chain structures. Data obtained with 4α-carboxy-cholest-7-en-3β-ol and its 3α-deuterated analog revealed that 3α-hydrogen-carbon bond cleavage is not the rate-limiting step of the reaction. In planta reduction on the expression of the 3βHSD/D gene as a consequence of VIGS-mediated gene silencing in Nicotiana benthamiana led to a substantial accumulation of 3β-hydroxy-4β,14-dimethyl-5α-ergosta-9β,19-cyclo-24(241)-en-4α-carboxylic acid, consistent with a decrease in 3βHSD/D activity. These two novel oxidative decarboxylases constitute the first molecularly and functionally characterized HSDs from a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family in plants.

These two novel oxidative decarboxylases constitute the first molecularly and functionally characterized HSDs from a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family in plants. Sterols are essential components of all eukaryotic cell membranes, and the biosynthetic pathways differ significantly. The sterol molecule becomes functional only after removal of the two methyl groups at C-4. Both methyl groups at C-4 are removed early and successively in animals and yeast, whereas in higher plants one methyl group is initially removed from a 4,4-dimethyl-9β,19-cyclopropylsterol precursor, and the second is eliminated several steps later (1Benveniste P.

In plants, we have characterized the activities of a sterol C-4 methyl oxidase (SMO), 3The abbreviations used are: SMO, sterol C-4-methyl oxidase; 3βHSD/D, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/C-4 decarboxylases; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SDR, short chain dehydrogenases/reductases; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; RT, reverse transcription. a 4α-carboxysterol-3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/C-4 decarboxylase (3βHSD/D), and an NADPH-dependent 3-oxosteroid reductase from partially purified preparations (4Pascal S.

Biophys. 1994; 312: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in order to define the steps involved in C-4 demethylation in plants. The first step is initiated by the SMO, whereby this enzyme converts the C-4α methyl group to produce a 4α-carboxysterol derivative that is subsequently oxidatively decarboxylated by the 3βHSD/D to produce a C-4-monodemethylated 3-oxosteroid, which is then stereospecifically reduced by the 3-ketoreductase. In contrast to animals and yeast where the SMO is encoded by a single gene (7Bard M. Bruner P.A. Pierson C.A. Lees N.D. Biermann B. Frye L. Koegel C. Barbuch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we biochemically characterized two distinct microsomal SMOs in Zea mays (4Pascal S. Taton M. Rahier A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11639-11654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we identified two distinct families of SMO genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (8Darnet S. Rahier A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Until now, the gene(s) coding the single bifunctional protein 3βHSD/D (Fig. 1) have not been characterized. Furthermore, little is known about plant hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases that are either members of the short chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) (9Oppermann U. Filling C. Jörnvall H. Chem. Biol.

Interact. 2003; 143: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), which include soluble and membranebound HSDs. Identification and characterization of gene(s)-encoding plant HSD of the SDR family have not been reported thus far. To further our knowledge about hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and the sterol C-4 demethylation multienzymatic complex in plants, in particular, we have identified and characterized at the molecular and enzymatic levels two novel 3βHSD/D isoforms from A. thaliana. In this study, we present identification and cloning of these 3βHSD/Ds cDNAs, in vivo heterologous and functional expression in yeast, in vitro enzymological characterization of the recombinant isoenzymes, and in planta down-regulation by virus-induced gene silencing. All materials were purchased from Sigma or as otherwise specified in the text. Strains and Plasmids—The erg26 SDG200 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deficient in 3β-hydroxydehydrogenase/C-4 decarboxylase activity (Mata ade5, his3, leu2-3, ura3-52, erg26Δ::TRP1 trp1::hisG Δhem1) used in the present study, has been described previously (13Gachotte D. Barbuch R. Gaylor J. Nickels E. Bard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13794-13799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sterol auxotrophs were grown aerobically at 30 °C on solid enriched medium (YPG: 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) supplemented with 2% ergosterol or cholesterol dissolved in ethanol/Tween 80 (1:1, v/v) or on minimal medium (YNB: 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose) containing suitable supplements (50 mg/liter each), casamino acids (1 g/liter) and 2% of ergosterol or cholesterol. In the case of liquid medium, the concentration of sterol used was 0.5%. Sterol prototrophic strains were grown aerobically at 30 °C on solid or liquid YNB medium containing suitable supplements (50 mg/liter each) or enriched medium (YPG) in the presence of δ-aminolevulinic acid (50 mg/liter). The pVT102U (14Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) S. cerevisiae shuttle vector optimized for expressing recombinant proteins in yeast was used for cloning, sequencing, and transformation of the erg26 strain. This plasmid contains an Escherichia coli origin of replication, a yeast 2-μm origin of replication, an E. coli ampicillin resistance gene, and the yeast URA3 gene. It contains an expression cassette, including the alcohol dehydrogenase promotor and terminator. TTO vector is an RNA viral vector and has been described previously (15Kumagai M.H. Donson J. Della-Cioppa G. Harvey D. Hanley K. Grill L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1679-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). It consists of sequences from tobacco mosaic virus strain U1 (TMV-U1) and tomato mosaic virus (fruit necrosis strain F; ToMV-F). Plants—Nicotiana benthamiana was grown in a greenhouse at 24 °C with a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. A. thaliana plantlets were from the Wassilewskija ecotype. cDNAs Cloning—We searched the Arabidopsis genome for genes encoding putative orthologs of the yeast ERG26 gene and also belonging to the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) family. Two genes were selected as follows: At1g47290 and At2g26260, and their corresponding cDNAs (At3βHSD/D1 and At3βHSD/D2, respectively) were cloned by PCR using reverse-transcribed mRNAs from the Wassilewskija ecotype. The amplified cDNA fragments were cloned into the XbaI and XhoI sites of the pVT102U shuttle vector and placed under the control of the constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. Because the lack of a C-terminal ER retrieval signal KKXX in At3βHSD/D2 might result in inefficient localization in the ER yeast C-4 demethylation complex, we replaced the seven terminal amino acids of At3βHSD/D2 with the KKID sequence to produce Δ-At3βHSD/D2, which was also cloned into the pVT102U vector. Total RNAs from A. thaliana plantlets were extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and treated with DNase to remove any residual DNA. SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen) was used to perform RT-PCRs with the following reverse primers: 5′-TTAGCTGATCTTCTTGCTCCCGAACACTTTC-3′ (P2) corresponding to At1g-47290 (NM_179448) and 5′-CTAATTGAAATATATGGTCATACCCTTTCGGCCC-3′ (P4) corresponding to At2g26260 (NM_128183.1), to specifically amplify the corresponding cDNAs. PCR amplification using an aliquot of RT-PCR, with the primer pair P1 = 5′-ATGGAAGTTACAGAGACTGAGCGATGGTGC-3′ and P2, yielded a 1143-bp cDNA, namely At3βHSD/D1 (AY957470) with two nucleotides changes between At3βHSD/D1 (ecotype Wassilewskija) and the At1g-47290 gene transcript (ecotype Columbia) (NM_179448), leading to two altered amino acids at position 68 (Pro to Ser) and position 354 (Arg to Lys) probably reflecting the distinct ecotypes. Amplification with primers P3 = 5′-ATGTCGCCGGCAGCTACGGAAC-3′ and P4 yielded a 1173-bp cDNA, namely At3βHSD/D2 (DQ302749), identical to the initially annotated At2g26260 gene sequence (NM_128183.1). At-tempts to amplify a cDNA corresponding to the recently updated splicing of the At2g26260 gene sequence (NM_128183.2) with specific oligonucleotides were unsuccessful. A 1161-bp DNA termed Δ-At3βHSD/D2, encoding an At3βHSD/D2 derivative that was missing the last 7 amino acid residues from the C terminus which was replaced by three KID residues and tailed by the KKID sequence, was generated by PCR. Two primers were designed as follows. The forward primer was P5 = 5′-ATAATATCTAGAATGTCGCCGGCAGCTAC-3′ containing an XbaI site, and the reverse primer was P6 = 5′-ATAATACTCGAGTTAGTCGATCTTCTTTCCGCCTCCAAGAATCC-3′ containing an XhoI site. The At3βHSD/D2 cDNA served as the template. PCR amplification entailed 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C using the HiFi PCR Master (Roche Applied Science). The amplified fragments were cloned into the XbaI and XhoI sites of the pVT102U vector to generate the plasmids pVT-At3βHSD/D1, and pVT-Δ-At3βHSD/D2. Both strands of the amplified cDNAs were sequenced to ensure sequence fidelity. To amplify 3βHSD/D in N. benthamiana, primers were designed according to consensus regions of aligned putative 3βHSD/D sequences of Solanacae and the codon usage of Nicotiana. A 500-bp fragment of the N. benthamiana 3β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase-C-4 decarboxylase geneamino acid residues from the C terminus was (Nb3βHSD/D) (AM236597) and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase gene (DXR) (AM236596), which was used as a control, were PCR-amplified from RNAs extracted from leaves of N. benthamiana using the following forward primers, respectively: 5′-GCCTCGAGGCTGATTTGGGTCCATCCATTAAACTTGAG-3′,5′-GCCTCGAGGGAGTGGCTATCAAAAGAAAGGAG-3′, and the following reverse primers: 5′-TCCCTAGGTCCTGCCTTTGCAGCTGCAACTAATGAAGGAAC-3′, 5′-TCCCTAGGCTTTATTGGCCAAGGCAATGTCCTTTC-3′. These products were cloned into the XhoI-AvrII restricted TTO viral vector (16Kumagai M.H. Keller Y. Bouvier F. Clary D. Camara B. Plant J. 1998; 14: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to generate TTO-Nb3βHSD/D and TTO-NbDXR, respectively. Virus-induced Gene Silencing in N. benthamiana—TTO-Nb3βHSD/D and TTO-NbDXR constructs were used to inoculate young N. benthamiana plants as described previously (16Kumagai M.H. Keller Y. Bouvier F. Clary D. Camara B. Plant J. 1998; 14: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To measure silencing of Nb3βHSD/D, semi-quantitative reverse transcription was performed also as described previously (8Darnet S. Rahier A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Bouvier F. Suire C. Mutterer J. Camara B. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Total RNAs isolated from uninoculated TTO-NbDXR and TTO-Nb3βHSD/D leaves were extracted and used for PCR. The forward 5′-GGAAGAGGCTTTGCTGCTCGG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCATGTGCTACATTCTCCACG-3′ primers that anneal outside the region used for Nb3βHSD/D silencing were employed. Amplification of the N. benthamiana α-tubulin gene was performed as a control using the forward 5′-ATGCTTTCATCATATGCCCCTGTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGCACCAACTTCCTCGTAATC-3′ primers. Identity Scores and Phylogenetic Analysis—Protein sequences of Arabidopsis 3βHSD/D and their homologs were identified by BLAST searches and aligned using the ClustalW algorithm. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed based on the sequence alignment and tested further with 1000 bootstraps resampling by using the MacVector package. Transformations—S. cerevisiae transformations were performed using the lithium acetate procedure as described previously (18Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The transformed erg26 yeast strain was plated on minimal YNB medium containing suitable supplements (adenine, 50 μg ml-1) without uracil and 2% of ergosterol, as well as on the same minimal YNB medium without uracil but also containing δ-aminolevulinic acid (50 mg/liter). Cells were grown aerobically at 30 °C. Sterol Analysis—Lyophilized yeast cells (10-30 mg) were sonicated in the presence of KOH/methanol (6%, w/v) (2 ml) for 10 min and heated in the same medium at 70 °C under reflux conditions for 2 h. The mixture was diluted with 1 volume of water, and after acidification to pH 3, total sterols were extracted three times with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate. The extract was dried on Na2SO4, evaporated to dryness, treated with 500 μl of a 0.4 m solution of diazomethane in diethyl ether for 1 h at 0°C and 1 h at room temperature, and then evaporated to dryness. Sterols were analyzed by gas chromatography. GC analysis was carried out with a Varian GC model 8300 (Les Ulis, France) equipped with a flame ionization detector at 300 °C, column injector at 250 °C, and a fused capillary column (WCOT, 30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter) coated with DB1(H2 flow rate of 2 ml/min). The temperature program used included a 30 °C/min increase from 60 to 240 °C and followed by a 2 °C/min increase from 240 to 280 °C. Relative retention times (tR) are given with respect to cholesterol (tR = 1). Identification of individual sterols was performed using a GC-MS spectrometer (Agilent 5973N) equipped with an “on column” injector and a capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter) coated with DB5. Sterols were unequivocally identified by retention times and an electron impact spectrum identical to that of authentic standards (19Rahier A. Benveniste P. Nes W.D. Parish E.D. Analysis of Sterols and Other Significant Steroids. Academic Press, New York1989: 223-250Google Scholar). Lyophilized plantlets of N. benthamiana (0.9-2.0 g) were homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer in the presence of methanol/methylene chloride (2:1, v/v) and heated in the same medium at 70 °C under reflux conditions for 3 h. The mixture was filtered, and the extract was evaporated to dryness. Acidic derivatives (RF = 0.0-0.12), desmethylsterols (RF = 0.27), 4α-methylsterols (RF = 0.38), 4,4-dimethylsterols (RF = 0.44), and sterol esters (RF = 0.70) were purified twice by TLC on Silica Gel 60F254 plates (Merck), using methylene chloride as developing solvent, and various fractions were eluted from the silica gel. Sterol esters were saponified under standard conditions. The polar fraction (RF = 0-0.12) was treated with diazomethane at 0 °C and subsequently acetylated under standard conditions. The derivatized polar fraction was further purified by TLC on Silica Gel 60F254 plates (Merck), using methylene chloride as developing solvent. The fraction with an RF = 0.07-0.20 and migrating with the standard of 4-carbomethoxysteryl acetate was eluted from the silica gel. A known amount of cholesterol was added as internal standard for GC quantification in the case of the 4α-methylsterol, 4,4-dimethylsterol, and 4-carboxymethylsteryl acetate fractions and of coprostane in the case of the desmethylsterol fraction. All fractions were then analyzed by GC and GC-MS under the same conditions as described above. Chemical Details—Melting points are uncorrected. Proton magnetic resonance was monitored in a [2H]chloroform solution with a Brucker 400- or 500-MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ) (ppm) were determined relative to tetramethylsilane. Coupling constants (J) were in Hertz. Substrates—For 4α-carboxy-cholest-7-en-3β-ol (1) (Fig. 2) was synthesized as described previously (5Rondet S. Taton M. Rahier A. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in absolute methanol (20 ml)) was stirred with sodium deuteroborohydride (NaBD4) (Aldrich) (25 mg) for 2 h at 0 °C. After the usual work up, the solid residue was purified by TLC (SiO2, eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate, 75:25 v/v) to yield pure 3α-deutero-4α-carbomethoxy-cholest-7-en-3β-ol (RF = 0.18) (55 mg), which was then separated from its 3α-hydroxy epimer (RF = 0.44) and crystallized in methanol, m.p. 147-149 °C. The compound showed a single peak in GC (tR = 1.368, DB5). MS m/z (relative intensity) was as follows: M+ = 445(95), 427(100), 412(54), 385(84), 367(11), 352(83), 314(77), 313(37), 272(38), 254(29).

This compound (30 mg) was refluxed with a solution of KOH (100 mg) in ethanol/H2O (80:20, v/v) (5 ml) for 2 h at 75 °C. After cooling at room temperature, the mixture was poured into water pH 3 (40 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate. The solvent was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness to give a white solid powder that was recrystallized from ethyl acetate to yield pure 3α-deutero-4α-carboxy-cholest-7-en-3β-ol (11) (25 mg) m.p. 229-231 °C.

Synthesis of 4α-carbomethoxy-cholest-7-en-3β-ol (10) and 4α-carboxy-cholest-7-en-3α-ol (5). Reduction of 4α-carbomethoxy-cholest-7-en-3-one by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and TLC purification under the same conditions as described above yielded 4α-carbomethoxy-cholest-7-en-3β-ol (10)(RF = 0.18) and 4α-carbomethoxy-cholest-7-en-3α-ol (21) (RF = 0.44).

Saponification of (21) with KOH in ethanol/H2O as above yielded pure 4α-carboxy-cholest-7-en-3α-ol (5). 1H NMR of (5): δ: 0.534(3H, s, H18), 0.838(3H, s, H19), 0.865(3H, d, J = 6.6, H26 or H27), 0.871(3H, d, J = 6.6, H26 or H27), 0.922 (3H, d, J = 6.5, H21), 2.507(1H, dd, J = 12.0, J = 2.2, H4β), 4.194(1H, s, ω1/2 = 8 Hz, H3β), 5.150(1H, d, J = 3.3, H7).

Pregnenolone (16), trans-androstenone (17), 3β-androstanediol (18), and dehydroepiandrosterone (19) were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of Microsomes—Yeast microsomes were prepared as described previously (20Darnet S. Rahier A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 106-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The corresponding 100,000 × g supernatants corresponding to the cytosolic extracts were concentrated 5-8-fold by dialysis over carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (Fluka) for 16 h at 4 °C. Standard Assay for Recombinant 4α-Carboxysterol-3-dehydrogenase-C-4 Decarboxylases —Microsomes (0.8 mg of protein) were incubated in the presence of exogenous synthetic 4α-carboxy-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol (1) (20-200 μm) emulsified with Tween 80 (final concentration 1.5 g/liter) and NAD+ at a 400 μm concentration (which is 50-fold the Km value). Incubations were continued aerobically at 30 °C with gentle stirring for 30-45 min. During this period the progression of the reaction was linear. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of EtOH. After addition of a known amount of coprostanone (1-4 μg) as internal standard, sterols and sterones were extracted from the incubation mixture three times with a total volume of 15 ml of n-hexane, and after drying with Na2SO4, the extract was concentrated to dryness. Under these conditions, the residual carboxysterol substrate was not extracted. The extract was analyzed by TLC on silica gel eluted with CH2Cl2 (developed twice). The fraction migrating as authentic standards of coprostanone and cholest-7-en-3-one (6) and containing the enzymatically produced cholest-7-en-3-one (RF = 0.50) was eluted and analyzed by GC (DB1) (supplemental Fig. A). The amount of cholest-7-en-3-one (6) produced (tR = 1.074) was calculated by comparison of the integrated peak areas with a known amount of added coprostanone (tR = 1.000), which also allowed the reaction rate of cholest-7-en-3-one to be determined. No endogenous component having the same tR as (6) was present in the inactivated control. The ketone metabolite produced by the reaction was unequivocally identified by its retention time on GC and by an electron impact mass spectrum identical to that of an authentic synthetic standard (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. A). Moreover, in control experiments, GC-MS analysis of the complete extract before TLC analysis indicated the absence of formation of cholest-7-en-3β-ol during the course of the incubation, confirming that in the absence of exogenously added NADPH to the microsomal extract, the C-4-demethylated-3-oxo-derivative was not reduced and further metabolized in accord with the cofactor requirements for this reduction step (6Pascal S. Taton M. Rahier A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the estimated limit of detection of the 3βHSD/D activity was 0.1-0.2 nmol × h-1·mg-1. Incubation of the 3α-deuterated substrate (11) was performed under the same standard conditions. For control experiments, the untransformed substrate (11) was extracted from the incubation mixture with ethyl acetate and methylated with diazomethane. GC-MS analysis of the 4-carbomethoxy derivative revealed no lost of deuterium, thus excluding a possible washout of the deuterium label at C-3 during the incubation procedure.TABLE 1GC-MS analysis of enzymatic products by the recombinant 3βHSD/Ds from ArabidopsisSubstrateEnzymatic productGC(DB1)MS (% relative abundance of molecular and prominents fragment ions)tRm/e %4α-Carboxy-cholest-7-en-3β-ol (1) and 4α-carboxy-cholest-7-en-3α-ol (5)Cholest-7-en-3-one (6)1.074M+ = 384(100); 369(39); 271(68); 229(44); 213(17)4α-Carboxy-4β-methyl-cholest-8,24-dien-3β-ol (2)4α-Methyl-cholest-8,24-dien-3-one (7)1.141M+ = 396(92); 381(100); 365(22); 283(22); 243(38)4α-Carboxy-4β,14α-dimethyl-9β,19-cyclo-ergost-24(241)-en-3β-ol (3)4α,14α-Dimethyl-9β,19-cyclo-ergost-24(241)-en-3-one (8)1.262M+ = 424(83); 409(61); 381(100); 340(39); 325(33); 300(33); 299(66)4α-Carboxy-stigmasta-7,24(241)-dien-3β-ol (4)Stigmasta-7,24(241)-dien-3-one (9)1.306M+ = 410(3); 312(20); 297(10); 260(100); 229(8) Open table in a new tab Apparent maximum velocity V and V/K values were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the nonlinear regression program DNRP-EASY derived by Duggleby which corresponds to Ref. 21Duggleby R.G.

https://openalex.org/W2008758031,"Junctional adhesion molecule 4 (JAM4) is a cell adhesion molecule that interacts with a tight junction protein, membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted 1 (MAGI-1). Our previous studies suggest that JAM4 is implicated in the regulation of paracellular permeability and the signalings of hepatocyte growth factor. In this study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening to search for an unidentified JAM4-binding protein and obtained one isoform of Ligand-of-Numb protein X1 (LNX1), LNXp70, that is an interactor of Numb. Ligand-of-Numb protein X1 is expressed in kidney glomeruli and intestinal epithelial cells, where JAM4 is also detected. Immunoprecipitation from kidney lysates supports the in vivo interaction of proteins. Biochemical studies reveal that JAM4 directly binds the second PDZ domain of LNX1 through its carboxyl terminus. Junctional adhesion molecule 4, LNX1 and Numb form a tripartite complex in vitro and are partially colocalized in heterologous cells. Ligand-of-Numb protein X1 facilitates endocytosis of JAM4 and is involved in transforming growth factor beta -induced redistribution of JAM4 in mammary epithelial cells. Experiments using dominant-negative constructs and RNA interference insure that Numb is necessary for the LNX1-mediated endocytosis of JAM4. All these findings indicate that LNX1 provides an endocytic scaffold for JAM4 that is implicated in the reorganization of cell junctions."

SLK down-regulation by v-Src is indirect and is accompanied by SLK hyperphosphorylation on serine residues. Deletion analysis revealed that casein kinase II (CK2) sites at position 347/348 are critical for v-Src-dependent modulation of SLK activity.

Cell growth and differentiation are tightly regulated mechanisms involving a large number of signaling cascades. Dysregulation and accumulation of genetic aberrations in these signaling cascades are key components in the transformation of a normal cell to a cancer cell. Furthermore, a direct correlation has been found between the metastatic potential of cancers and the nature of the observed genetic mutations (1Irby R.B. Mao W. Coppola D. Kang J. Loubeau J.M.

Indeed, cellular transformation by the src oncogene, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, results in loss of adherence, invasiveness, and metastasis through increased phosphorylation of adhesion proteins and cytoskeletal disorganization. c-Src and its viral counterpart v-Src are the most studied members of Src family kinases. Several studies have illustrated potential Src-mediated mechanisms regulating cell survival and apoptosis (6Frame M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 114-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition, studies have demonstrated altered c-Src kinase activity, and in some cases protein levels, in human cancers such as breast, colon, and pancreatic cancers (3Jones R.J. Brunton V.G.

To gain further insights into the role of SLK in this process, we investigated whether regulators of early adhesion signaling events impact on SLK activity. Our results show that SLK kinase activity is reduced in cells expressing an oncogenic form of c-Src and that this regulation requires Src kinase activity and translocation to the cell periphery. Furthermore, expression of v-Src in focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-null cells also resulted in SLK down-regulation, suggesting that v-Src-mediated SLK regulation is independent of FAK. Phosphoamino acid analysis of SLK in v-Src-expressing cells shows that SLK is hyperphosphorylated on serine residues and that v-Src-dependent SLK regulation is mediated, in part, by direct phosphorylation by CK2 in the SLK kinase domain. Our results suggest that CK2 may be regulating SLK at sites of cytoskeletal remodeling. Cell Lines and Immunostaining—HEK293, COS1, and 49F cells were purchased from the American Tissue Type Collection. The mesodermal FAK-/- cells (p53-/-, FAK-/-), and wild-type counterpart were kindly provided by D. Ilic. The SYF cells, deficient for src, yes, and fyn and SYF cells stably expressing c-src were a generous gift from P. Soriano. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio-Whitaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. v-Src-transformed 49F cells were generated by puromycin (2 μg/ml) (Sigma) selection of pBabePuro3-transfected cells. Cells stably expressing fpgv-1 or tsLA29 v-Src were obtained by G418 (0.4 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) selection following transfection of tsLA29 v-src or empty vector. Prior to SLK kinase assays, cells stably expressing fpgv-1 or tsLA29 v-Src (maintained at 40 °C) were shifted to 35 °C for 24-48 h. Other transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For immunostaining the coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin or 200 μg/ml ChromaPure Goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). SLK was detected using an anti-SLK rabbit polyclonal antibody (15Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in conjunction with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies. CK2 and c-Src proteins were detected with an anti-CK2 goat polyclonal (C-18; Santa Cruz) and an anti-c-Src monoclonal (Sigma) in conjunction with TRITC-labeled secondary antibodies. TRITC-conjugated phalloidin was used to detect actin stress fibers. Samples were visualized on a Zeiss Axioskop100 epifluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters and photographed with a digital camera (Sony Corporation HBO50) using the Northern Eclipse software package. Plasmids—The pBabepuro3 v-src encoding the avian v-Src was kindly provided by M. McMahon. HA-tagged pcDNA3 expression vectors bearing full-length FAK, FAK kinase dead (FAK-K454R), the FAK Y397F mutant FRNK, and the FRNK S1084A mutant were kindly provided by D. Schlaepfer. The fpgv-1 control vector and the tsLA29 v-src encoding the temperature-sensitive v-Src were generously provided by M. C. Frame. The HA-v-Src kinase inactive point mutant was generated using PCR-based mutagenesis converting lysine 298 to a methionine generating v-SrcK298M. Similarly, a HA-v-Src myristoylation site mutant (HA-v-SrcG2A) construction was also generated. The v-Src cDNA and mutant PCR products were subcloned into an HA-tagged pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) using standard cloning procedures (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All PCR-generated mutants were subjected to sequencing analysis at the Ottawa Health Research Institute. Sequencing data were analyzed using EditSeq and MegAlign (DNAStar computer software). Inactive SLK kinase domain (Myc-SLK1-373K63R) truncations were generated using a PCR-based approach. Myc-SLK1-192K63R, containing amino acid residues 1-192, was PCR amplified using Myc-SLK1-373K63R as DNA template and the T7 primer with SLK192 (5′-CCG CTC GAG CTA AGC CAT CCA ATA TGG TGT-3′). Myc-SLK1-325K63R, containing amino acid residues 1-325, was generated with Myc-SLK1-373K63R as template with T7 and SLK325 (5′-CCG CTC GAG CTA CAG AGC ATT CTC TGC TTC-3′) primers. Bold type shows cloning restriction sites and underlining shows mutated codons. Serine residues 340, 347, 348, 362, and 364 were mutated to alanines by PCR using primers bearing the appropriate mutations. Subcloning of the PCR products into Myc-SLK pcDNA3 expression vector was performed using standard procedures. Fibronectin Replating Assays—Subconfluent cultures were serum starved in 0.25% fetal bovine serum-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h and harvested by trypsin-EDTA treatment as described previously (17Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Science. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were held in suspension (0.1% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) for 1 h at 37°Cand then plated onto FN (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) or poly-L-lysine (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) precoated coverslips. Immunoprecipitations, Kinase Assays, and Western Blots—Cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and protein extracts were made in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Sigma inhibitor cocktails). Samples (40 μg) were fractionated on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes for Western blotting. Reactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer) using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and visualized by autoradiography. For SLK kinase assays, 400 μg of total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of anti-SLK or 9E10 antibodies and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with NETN (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 0.1%. Nonidet P-40) and once with SLK kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 10mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm orthovanadate). Kinase reactions (20 μlin kinase buffer) were initiated by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer, and 20-μl aliquots were fractionated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to PVDF membranes and exposed to x-ray film. PVDF membranes were then probed for SLK to evaluate the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation. To assay CK2 activity, 400 μg of total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of anti-CK2α goat polyclonal antibodies (C-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed three times with NETN and once with modified CK2 kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm orthovanadate) (13Donella-Deana A. Cesaro L. Sarno S. Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Vilk G. Doherty-Kirby A. Lajoie G. Litchfield D.W. Pinna L.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reactions (20 μl in kinase buffer) were initiated by the addition of 3 μg of dephosphorylated casein (C4032; Sigma) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions (30 min/37 °C) were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer, and 20-μl aliquots were fractionated by a gradient gel 8-12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to PVDF membranes, Ponceau stained, and then exposed to x-ray film. 40 μg of total cell lysates was subjected to Western blot with anti-CK2α goat polyclonal antibodies (C-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect endogenous CK2α proteins. Recombinant CK2 Kinase Assays—To assay SLK phosphorylation by CK2, recombinant SLK mutants were used in kinase assays with purified CK2. SLK GST fusions on glutathione-agarose were washed with NETN and CK2 kinase buffer. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 μl of recombinant CK2 from rat liver (C3460; Sigma) and ATP as above. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, beads were washed seven times with NETN to remove any traces of recombinant CK2 and once with PBS. For tryptic digests, beads were incubated in 50 mm NH4HCO3 with 10 units/μl of trypsin from bovine pancreas (T8802; Sigma) overnight at 37 °C, followed by the addition of another 10 μl of 1 unit/μl of trypsin for 4 h at 37 °Cthe next day. The reaction was terminated by adding 4× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and fractionated on a 20% Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Expression of the undigested GST fusions was confirmed by independent SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining of the purified undigested proteins. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—On the day of the assay, exponentially growing cells were washed twice and incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 2h.[32P]Orthophosphate (250 μCi/ml) was then added for an additional 4 h. After the labeling period, cells were washed three times with TBS (preincubated at 4 °C) and lysed using modified radioimmune precipitation buffer with protease inhibitors as above. Equal amounts of cell lysates were used to immunoprecipitate endogenous SLK using 2 μg of anti-SLK antibodies overnight at 4 °C. SLK protein was eluted off the beads with 50 μl of redistilled 5.7 m HCl and hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 1 h. Dried samples were then dissolved in 2 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid/acetic acid) containing 1 mg/ml of xylene cyanol, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards (Sigma). Samples were subjected to thin layer chromatography in pH 1.9 buffer followed by electrophoresis in pH 3.5 buffer (pyridine/acetic acid). Amino acid standards were visualized with 0.2% ninhydrin followed by exposure to x-ray film. v-Src Down-regulates SLK Kinase Activity—Fibronectin stimulation of fibroblasts has been shown to trigger the activation of FAK, the recruitment of c-Src, and the formation of adhesion signaling complexes mediating actin rearrangements (18Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 19Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FAK and c-Src appear to be critical for the turnover of these complexes, allowing cell migration. We have previously shown that SLK can induce actin disassembly and that it is redistributed to membrane structures reminiscent of ruffles and lamellipodia during cell spreading on FN (14Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, to gain further insights into the role of SLK in cytoskeletal remodeling, we have investigated SLK activity in FAK- and SYF-deficient cell lines or v-Src-transformed cells. We performed SLK in vitro kinase assays on cell lysates from FAK-WT, FAK-/-, SYF-deficient, SYF+c-src, and 49F fibroblasts stably expressing the v-src oncogene. In vitro kinase assays showed no change in SLK kinase activity in SYF-deficient, SYF+c-src, FAK-null, or FAK-WT cells (Fig. 1A). However, a 2- to 3-fold decrease in SLK kinase activity was consistently observed in v-Src-transformed cells (Fig. 1), suggesting that activated c-Src or its downstream effectors negatively regulates SLK. In addition, 49F cells stably expressing c-SrcY527F, a constitutively active mutant of c-Src, also showed a down-regulation of SLK kinase activity (not shown). To further understand the mechanism by which v-Src down-regulates SLK activity, we generated 49F cells stably expressing tsLA29v-Src, a mutant v-Src that is temperature sensitive for translocation to adhesion sites (20Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Shifting the cultures to the permissive temperature (35 °C) results in the translocation of v-Src to the cell periphery. Incubation of the cells at the permissive temperature resulted in a 2- to 3-fold decrease in SLK kinase activity concomitant with the characteristic v-Src-induced morphological changes (see Fig. 1, F-H). Supporting a role for c-Src in SLK regulation, immunofluorescence staining of exponentially growing 49F cells revealed that c-Src and SLK proteins could be co-localized at membrane ruffles and lamellipodia (Fig. 1, C and D). Furthermore, shifting the tsLA29v-Src cells to the permissive temperature also resulted in SLK v-Src co-localization (Fig. 1, E and F). Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of SLK followed by immunoblotting for phosphotyrosine residues revealed that SLK is not tyrosine phosphorylated under these conditions (not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that v-Src-mediated SLK down-regulation is indirect and that this requires v-Src translocation to the membrane. v-Src Kinase Activity and Membrane Translocation Are Required for SLK Down-regulation—Previous studies have shown that c-Src kinase activity is required for Rac1- and cdc42-induced adhesion remodeling and directed cell migration whereas the Src SH3 and SH2 domains are sufficient for its translocation to the cell periphery in a RhoA-dependent manner (20Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21Timpson P. Jones G.E. Frame M.C. Brunton V.G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1836-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the role of v-Src kinase activity and myristoylation site on SLK down-regulation. A kinase inactive (v-SrcK298M) and myristoylation-defective (v-SrcG2A) mutant was engineered and co-transfected with Myc-SLK in HEK293 cells. SLK immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays showed that both v-Src point mutants could no longer down-regulate SLK kinase activity compared with controls (Fig. 2A). Together, these data suggest that both v-Src kinase activity and membrane anchoring are required to negatively regulate SLK kinase activity. v-Src-mediated Down-regulation of SLK Kinase Activity Is Independent of FAK—Integrin signaling following FN stimulation proceeds through the recruitment and autophosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-397, causing its transient association with activated c-Src and further phosphorylation (4Ruoslahti E. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1413-1417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similarly, in v-Src-transformed cells, FAK is hyperphosphorylated, in addition to other adhesion complex proteins (22Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 23Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 24Fincham V.J. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2247-2252PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether SLK could also be down-regulated by FAK. To test this, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with Myc-SLK and either wild-type FAK, alone or in combination with the dominant negative FRNK molecule, or the non-FAK binding mutant FRNK S1084A (25Hauck C.R. Hsia D.A. Puente X.S. Cheresh D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6289-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays showed that FAK overexpression had no effect on SLK kinase activity (Fig. 2B). Similarly, overexpression of FRNK had no significant effect. Supporting these observations, SLK kinase activity was still down-regulated in FAK-WT or FAK-/- cells stably expressing the oncoprotein v-Src (Fig. 2C). Together, these results suggest that v-Src-mediated SLK down-regulation does not proceed through FAK and its downstream signaling pathways but rather by activating an independent signaling system. SLK Is Hyperphosphorylated in v-Src-transformed Cells—To investigate whether potential post-translational modifications on SLK, other than tyrosine phosphorylation, were responsible for the negative down-regulation, we conducted phosphoamino acid analysis. Endogenous SLK protein was immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled control or v-Src-transformed cells, subjected to acid hydrolysis, and resolved by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that SLK is hyperphosphorylated solely on serine residues in v-Src- or c-SrcY527F-transformed 49F cells in comparison to 49F cells (Fig. 3A), supporting the notion that the v-Src- or c-SrcY527F-mediated effect is indirect. Treatment of 49F cells with phosphatase inhibitors followed by SLK immunoprecipitation showed no changes in kinase activity (not shown), suggesting that v-Src-mediated SLK down-regulation proceeds through the modulation of a serine/threonine kinase. To identify potential kinases involved in the down-regulation of SLK activity, we have focused on amino acids 1-373, encompassing all of the kinase subdomains for the identification of target serine residues. To that end, Myc-tagged SLK kinase inactive constructs (Myc-SLK1-373K63R, Myc-SLK1-192K63R, and Myc-SLK1-325 K63R), each designed to contain a small number of serine residues and encompassing the kinase domain, were generated. Co-transfection of these constructs with or without v-Src in HEK293 cells revealed that only the Myc-SLK1-373K63R truncation was hyperphosphorylated, suggesting a potential phosphorylation occurring within the last 9 serine residues of the kinase domain (Fig. 3B). The peptide sequence containing these last serine residues was analyzed for potential protein phosphorylation sites using ScanProsite from ExPASy. Primary sequence analysis showed the presence of putative protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and CK2 phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3C). To test the role of protein kinase A and protein kinase C on SLK kinase activity, HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-SLK and treated with either dibutyryl cyclic AMP or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Following SLK immunoprecipitation and kinase assays, no changes in SLK kinase activity were observed (not shown). Supporting this, Myc-tagged SLK point mutants S340A and S364A, sites of potential protein kinase A and protein kinase C phosphorylation, respectively, showed no changes in kinase activity at the basal level or when co-expressed with HA-v-Src (not shown), suggesting that the v-Src effect is not mediated by protein kinase A or protein kinase C. CK2 Phosphorylates SLK and Regulates Its Kinase Activity—To investigate the potential role of CK2 on SLK kinase activity, Myc-SLK point mutants for serine residues 347/348 and 362 were generated (Myc-SLK SS347/348AA and Myc-SLK S362A). HEK293 cells transfected with these constructs revealed that Myc-SLK SS347/8AA displayed a 2- to 3-fold increase in basal kinase activity when compared with Myc-SLK (Fig. 4A). In addition, co-transfection of Myc-SLK SS347/348AA with HA-v-Src did not result in the down-regulation of SLK kinase activity (Fig. 4A). Examination of the CK2a protein content in HEK293 cells revealed that it is highly expressed (Fig. 4A), suggesting that CK2 may potentially regulate the catalytic activity of the transfected Myc-SLK (Fig. 4A). Therefore, we next addressed whether SLK is directly phosphorylated by CK2 on serine 347/348 or 362. The kinase domain mutants were GST tagged and subjected to an in vitro CK2 kinase assay in the presence or absence of recombinant rat liver CK2 (Sigma). Following the kinase assay, samples were either digested with thrombin to remove the GST peptide or with trypsin to reveal the 1.5-kDa peptide of interest containing serines 347/348 or 362 (Fig. 5A). Both thrombin and trypsin digests showed that the SLK mutant SS347/348AA displayed a marked decrease in its phosphorylation level relative to GST-SLK1-373K63R or GST-SLK1-373K63R S362A. These results suggest that CK2 can phosphorylate SLK directly on serine residues 347/348 and that this results in SLK down-regulation.FIGURE 5CK2 phosphorylates SLK at serine 347/348 in vitro. A, GST-tagged kinase inactive SLK (SLK1-373K63R) harboring mutations at serine residues 347/348 and 362 were generated (SLK-AA and SLK-A) and subjected to in vitro kinase assays in the presence or absence of rat liver recombinant CK2 (rCK2). Samples were digested with thrombin (A) or trypsin (B), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray film. The Coomassie-stained gel in panel A shows the GST fusions following thrombin treatment. The stained gel in panel B shows the GST fusions prior to trypsin digestion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of CK2 Rescues SLK Kinase Activity in v-Src-transformed Cells—To assess the role of CK2 on SLK kinase activity in v-Src-transformed cells, we used 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-2-azabenzimidazole (TBB) (Calbiochem), a specific CK2 inhibitor on v-Src-expressing cells (27Sarno S. Reddy H. Meggio F. Ruzzene M. Davies S.P. Donella-Deana A. Shugar D. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Control and v-Src-transformed 49F cells were first treated overnight with 50 mm TBB. SLK and CK2 were then immunoprecipitated independently from the same cell lysate and subjected to in vitro kinase assays. Our results show that after TBB treatment SLK kinase activity in v-Src-transformed cells is similar to that of wild-type 49F cells (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, we observed a dramatic increase in CK2 kinase activity in v-Src-transformed cells, suggesting that v-Src transformation results in CK2 activation (Fig. 6B). As previously reported, TBB treatment resulted in a decrease in CK2 kinase activity in both cell lines. Supporting a role for CK2 in the regulation of SLK activity, SLK and CK2α could be co-localized at the cell periphery in 49F cells following a 20-min replating assay on FN matrix (Fig. 6C). We have previously described that overexpression of SLK in various cell lines induces the rapid disassembly of actin stress fibers and cell death (28Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that v-Src expression leads to down-regulation of SLK kinase activity, a process that requires v-Src translocation to the membrane, kinase activity, and membrane anchoring. Surprisingly, this down-regulation does not proceed through FAK or by direct tyrosine phosphorylation of SLK but rather through activation of CK2, which in turn down-regulates SLK. We have observed a marked increase in SLK phosphoserine content in v-Src- and c-SrcY527F-transformed 49F cells in comparison with parental cells. Further mapping identified two serine residues located at position 347/348 (SS347/348) that are phosphorylated by CK2. Although we have focused on the catalytic region of SLK as the target of v-Src-mediated down-regulation, truncation analysis of the full-length SLK revealed that SLK is also serine phosphorylated on its M-NAP and ATH domains (15Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), however at much lower levels (not shown). Therefore, serine phosphorylation of those domains cannot be excluded as other important regulatory sites. Nonetheless, serine 347/348 residues are the main CK2 targets within the kinase domain. Previous studies have shown that the Src family kinases Lyn and c-Fgr are capable of phosphorylating CK2α subunit, leading to an increase in its kinase activity in vitro (13Donella-Deana A. Cesaro L. Sarno S. Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Vilk G. Doherty-Kirby A. Lajoie G. Litchfield D.W. Pinna L.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have observed a marked increase in CK2 activity in v-Src-transformed cells that could not be attributed to differences in protein expression levels. Therefore, one possibility is that v-Src may directly modulate CK2 activity. Supporting this, we have demonstrated that the inhibition of CK2 activity in v-Src-transformed cells restores the catalytic activity of SLK. We have previously demonstrated that SLK is redistributed with vinculin to structures reminiscent of membrane lamellipodia and ruffles during cell spreading on FN (14Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, CK2 can be co-localized with SLK in these structures (Fig. 6). In addition, our previous results show that SLK-mediated actin stress fiber disassembly can be inhibited by the co-expression of a dominant negative Rac1 (RacN17). Interestingly, Timpson et al. (21Timpson P. Jones G.E. Frame M.C. Brunton V.G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1836-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) showed that c-Src kinase activity is required at peripheral adhesion sites for Rac1- and cdc42-induced adhesion remodeling and directed cell migration. Therefore, one possibility is that the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics by SLK may be controlled by c-Src. Alternatively, the observed decrease in SLK kinase activity in v-Src-expressing cells may be specific to v-Src transformation. A role for CK2 in cell survival has been demonstrated (8Ahmed K. Gerber D.A. Cochet C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 226-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In addition, SLK overexpression has been shown to induce an apoptotic response (15Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7566-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Seale P. Wagner J. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Hao W. Takano T. Guillemette J. Papillon J. Ren G. Cybulsky A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3075-3084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, another possibility is that SLK activity is down-regulated in v-Src-transformed cells as part of an anti-apoptotic pathway. The signaling mechanisms that ensue downstream of SLK and how they regulate cytoskeletal remodeling and cell death will allow these hypotheses to be tested."
https://openalex.org/W2000386429,"Retroviral proteases are encoded in the retroviral genome and are responsible for maturation and assembly of infectious virus particles. A number of retroviral protease sequences with retroviral elements are integrated in every eukaryotic genome as endogenous retroviruses. Recently, retroviral-like aspartic proteases that were not embedded within endogenous retroviral elements were identified throughout the eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. However, the physiological role of this novel protease family, especially in mammals, is not known. During the high throughput in situ hybridization screening of mouse epidermis, as a granular layer-expressing clone, we identified a mouse homologue of SASPase (Skin ASpartic Protease), a recently identified retroviral-like aspartic protease. We detected and purified the endogenous 32-kDa (mSASP32) and 15-kDa (mSASP15) forms of mSASP from mouse stratum corneum extracts and determined their amino acid sequences. Next, we bacterially produced recombinant mSASP15 via autoprocessing of GST-mSASP32. Purified recombinant mSASP15 cleaved a quenched fluorogenic peptide substrate, designed from the autoprocessing site for mSASP32 maximally at pH 5.77, which is close to the pH of the epidermal surface. Finally, we generated mSASP-deficient mice that at 5 weeks of age showed fine wrinkles that ran parallel on the lateral trunk without apparent epidermal differentiation defects. These results indicate that the retroviral-like aspartic protease, SASPase, is involved in prevention of fine wrinkle formation via activation in a weakly acidic stratum corneum environment. This study provides the first evidence that retroviral-like aspartic protease is functionally important in mammalian tissue organization. Retroviral proteases are encoded in the retroviral genome and are responsible for maturation and assembly of infectious virus particles. A number of retroviral protease sequences with retroviral elements are integrated in every eukaryotic genome as endogenous retroviruses. Recently, retroviral-like aspartic proteases that were not embedded within endogenous retroviral elements were identified throughout the eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. However, the physiological role of this novel protease family, especially in mammals, is not known.

This study provides the first evidence that retroviral-like aspartic protease is functionally important in mammalian tissue organization. Proteases play an important role in many physiological processes by regulating the activation, synthesis, and turnover of proteins (1Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar). Proteases are classified into five distinct classes as follows: aspartic, metallo-, cysteine, serine, and threonine proteases. Of these, aspartic proteases, also designated as acidic proteases, are a widely distributed family of proteolytic enzymes known to exist in vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi, plants, and retroviruses (2Rao J.K.M. Erickson J.W. Wlodawer A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4663-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Tang J. Wong R.N.S. J. Cell Biochem. 1987; 33: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic aspartic proteases are ∼330-residue monomeric enzymes that consist of two homologous domains. Each domain contains an active site centered on a catalytically essential aspartic residue. These enzymes are synthesized as zymogens that are subsequently proteolytically processed. On the other hand, retroviruses are known to encode aspartic proteases in the viral genome (4Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S.F. Doran E.R. Rafalski J.A. Whitehorn E.A. Baumeister K. Ivanoff L. Petteway Jr., S.R. Pearson M.L. Lautenberger J.A. Papas T.S. Ghrayeb J. Chang N.T. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1985; 313: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). This retroviral aspartic protease is expressed as part of a large polyprotein precursor, with the mature protease released via autoprocessing activity. The primary structure of the enzyme corresponds to a single domain that undergoes autoprocessing in viral particles to produce an active one that exists as a homodimer. Recent analysis of human, mouse, and rat genomes have revealed that 553, 628, and 626 genes, respectively, are encoded as proteases or protease homologues (5Puente X.S. Sánchez L.M. Overall C.M. López-Otín C. Nature Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 6Puente X.S. López-Otín C. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the human genome, 21 genes are eukaryotic aspartic proteases, and more than 150 sequences are related to aspartic proteases that are embedded in endogenous retroviral elements as human endogenous retroviruses (5Puente X.S. Sánchez L.M. Overall C.M. López-Otín C. Nature Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Most of these human endogenous retroviruses are believed to have been acquired 10-100 million years ago (7Lower R. Lower J. Kurth R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5177-5184Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Previously, Krylov and Koonin (8Krylov D.M. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R584-R587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described new subfamilies of predicted retroviral-like aspartic proteases that include several human paralogues. These genes encode enzymes with some similarity to retroviral aspartic proteases, although they are not embedded within endogenous retroviral elements. They included the DNA damage-inducible UbL-UbA proteins Ddi1p and Ddi2p, neuron-specific nuclear receptors NIX1, NRIP2, and NRIP3, and other Ddi1p-related aspartic proteases (5Puente X.S.

Dermatol. 2005; 125: 278-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have separated total protein extracts of human reconstructed epidermis and identified a novel retroviral-like aspartic protease, SASPase (Skin ASpartic Protease). Human SASPase (hSASP) 3The abbreviations used are: hSASP, human SASPase; mSASP, mouse SASP; Nma, 2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl; Dnp, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EST, expressed sequence tag; GST, glutathione S-transferase; pAb, polyclonal antibody; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; nano-ESI MS/MS, nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry; MS, mass spectrometry; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; SC, stratum corneum; SCE, stratum corneum extracts; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; rmSASP, recombinant mSASP; ES, embryonic stem. was expressed in the granular layer of human epidermis, and immunoblotting of human epidermal extract revealed the expression of two forms of the enzyme, the 28- and 14-kDa forms. Similar to other retroviral proteases, recombinant SASPase undergoes auto-activation processing in vitro, and subsequently a 14-kDa protein is generated. The amino acid sequences of this recombinant 14-kDa product (hSASP14) were determined and shown to correspond with the protease domain. However, it was not clarified whether hSASP14 possessed protease activity, and its optimum pH was not determined. More importantly, the physiological role of SASPase is uncertain. We have previously performed high throughput in situ hybridization screening against sections of mouse foot sole epidermis using an equalized mouse back skin cDNA library (14Matsui T. Hayashi-Kisumi F. Kinoshita Y. Katahira S. Morita K. Miyachi Y. Ono Y. Imai T. Tanigawa Y. Komiya T. Tsukita S. Genomics. 2004; 84: 384-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Among them, we identified a mouse homologue of SASPase as a clone specifically expressed in the granular layer of epidermis. Here we report the purification of processed forms of endogenous mouse SASPase (mSASP) from mouse stratum corneum extracts (SCE) and the determination of their amino acid sequences. From these sequences, we succeeded in producing and purifying active recombinant protein in bacteria and performed biochemical analysis. Furthermore, to study the physiological role of SASPase, we generated SASPase-deficient mice. They unexpectedly formed fine skin wrinkles. Our data are the first evidence that genome-integrated retroviral-like aspartic protease is functionally important in mammalian tissue architecture. Materials—Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Proligo Japan (Kyoto, Japan). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and mass spectrometric analysis were performed by Aproscience Co. Ltd. (Tokushima, Japan). Peptide (Nma-LFANSMG-K(Dnp)rrr-NH2) was synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography by Peptide Inc. (Osaka, Japan) and dissolved in Me2SO. FRETS-25-STD1 and FRETS-25-STD2 were also purchased from Peptide Inc. Generation of knock-out mice was performed by Kurabo, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). All animal studies have been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the KAN Research Institute, Inc. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (14Matsui T. Hayashi-Kisumi F. Kinoshita Y. Katahira S. Morita K. Miyachi Y. Ono Y. Imai T. Tanigawa Y. Komiya T. Tsukita S. Genomics. 2004; 84: 384-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Komiya T. Tanigawa Y. Hirohashi S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). cDNA Cloning and Recombinant Protein Expression—Mouse back skin total RNA was isolated from 8-week-old female BALB/c mice according to the method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was prepared by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) from mouse back skin total RNA. The DNA fragment encoding open reading frame of the mouse SASPase 32-kDa form (mSASP32) was amplified from a mouse back skin cDNA library by PCR using 5′-EcoRI-mSASP32 primer (5′-ATATGAATTCGCCACCATGGCCACCAGCGGAGTCAG-3′) and 3′-NotI-mSASP32 primer (5′-AATTGCGGCCGCTTAGTGGGAGCCCTCCGGTG), respectively. These primers were designed using the sequence from GenBank™ accession number BC057938. After digestion with EcoRI and NotI, the cDNA was subcloned into EcoRI-NotI sites of pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare) to yield pGEX-mSASP32. Protease-dead mutant, pGEX-mSASP32(D210A), was generated by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) from pGEX-mSASP32 by mutating the active aspartic acid residue (amino acid 210) to alanine. To prepare antibodies against mSASP, the cDNA fragment encoding residues 182-300 of mSASP32(D210A) (mSASP-(182-300)(D210A)) was amplified from pGEX-mSASP32(D210A) by PCR using 5′-SalI-mSASP-PR primer (5′-ATATGTCGACGCCACCGAAGAGATTTTGTTTGCCAACAGC-3′) and 3′-NotI-mSASP-PR primer (5′-AATTGCGGCCGCGGTGCGGTGTTCGAAGTCCAGCAC-3′). To produce GST fusion protein of mSASP-(182-300)(D210A), the PCR product was digested with SalI and NotI and then subcloned into SalI-NotI sites of pGEX4T-3 to yield pGEX-mSASP-(182-300)(D210A). To produce His-tagged mSASP-(182-300)(D210A), the NotI site was introduced between XhoI and PstI sites of pRSET-A (Invitrogen) to yield pRSET-A(NotI), and the SalI/NotI-digested PCR-product was subcloned into XhoI-NotI sites of pRSET-A(NotI) to yield pRSET-mSASP-(182-300)(D210A). Recombinant protein, GST-mSASP32, GST-mSASP32-(D210A), GST-mSASP-(182-300)(D210A), and His6-mSASP-(182-300)(D210A) were produced and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified GST-mSASP-(182-300) (D210A) was cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST to yield the mSASP-(182-300)(D210A) protein by the thrombin cleavage capture kit (Novagen, Madison, WI). Northern Blotting and Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Northern blotting and quantitative real time RT-PCR were performed as described previously (14Matsui T. Hayashi-Kisumi F. Kinoshita Y. Katahira S. Morita K. Miyachi Y. Ono Y. Imai T. Tanigawa Y. Komiya T. Tsukita S. Genomics. 2004; 84: 384-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The primer set was as follows: mouse mSASP (BC057938), forward primer (5′-AGAGGCTATTATTGGCACAGACGTC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GGAGCAGGCGGAACTTCTTC-3′). Antibodies—The pAb specific for the C-terminal domain of mSASP32 was produced in rabbits against synthetic peptide (EFDLELIEEEEGSSAPEGSH) corresponding to the amino acids 320-339 of mSASP32 (mSASP-C pAb). The mSASP-C pAb was affinity-purified on this peptide covalently coupled to thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B (GE Healthcare). This pAb specifically recognized mSASP32 by immunoblotting. We raised two rabbit antisera specific for the protease domain of mSASP, mSASP-PR1 and mSASP-PR2 pAbs (where PR stands for protease domain). The mSASP-PR1 pAb was raised against the mSASP-(182-300)(D210A) protein and was affinity-purified on His6-mSASP-(182-300)(D210A) covalently coupled to a Hitrap NHS-activated HP 1-ml column (GE Healthcare). This pAb specifically recognized both mSASP32 and mSASP15 by immunoblotting. mSASP-PR2 pAb was raised against GST-mSASP32(D210A) and was affinity-purified on His6-mSASP-(182-300)(D210A) as described above. This pAb specifically recognized both mSASP32 and mSASP15 by immunoprecipitation. The flow-through fraction of antiserum during affinity purification of mSASP-PR2 pAb was used for immunoabsorption of mSASP32 (mSASP-N pAb antiserum). Mouse monoclonal antibody to keratin 1/10 (clone k8.60) was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit antibodies to keratin 14, keratin 1, involucrin, filaggrin, and loricrin were purchased from Covance (Denver, PA). A rabbit antibody against desmoglein 1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Delaware, CA). Preparation of SCE from Nude Mice—Mice (8-week-old female BALB/c nude mice) were first anesthetized, and the surface of the skin was washed with 10 ml per mouse of a SCE buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Nakalai Tesque, Tokyo, Japan)). Thereafter, the washed area was scraped with the edge of a microscope slide and continuously rinsed with SCE buffer. The buffer containing corneocytes was collected in a container placed below the mice. Corneocytes were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed over a Millex-GV (0.45 μm; Millipore, Billerica, MA) and then over a Millex-HV (0.22 μm; Millipore). The resulting SCE was ∼0.25 mg/ml. Immunoprecipitation of mSASP32/15 and N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—First, 0.3 ml of protein G-Sepharose 4B fast flow (GE Healthcare) was incubated with 0.3 mg of mSASP-PR2 pAb for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with SCE buffer, beads were incubated with 15 ml (3.75 mg of protein) of nude mouse SCE for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then extensively washed with PBS. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in an SDS sample buffer (62 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.7, 3% SDS and 5% glycerol) for 5 min. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained by 2D Silver Stain II (DAIICHI Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) or Coomassie staining solution (Bio-Rad). The mSASP32 and mSASP15 bands were excised from the gel and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Purification of mSASP15 from Mouse SCE and C-terminal Amino Acid Analysis—5 mg of mSASP-PR2 pAb was coupled to 0.8 ml of Hitrap NHS-activated HP column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instruction and equilibrated with SCE buffer (mSASP-PR2 pAb column). 3 ml of mSASP-N pAb antiserum was incubated with 1 ml of protein G-Sepharose 4B fast flow for 4 h at 4 °C and equilibrated with SCE buffer. 30 ml of mouse SCE was incubated with these beads for 1 h at 4 °C to immunodeplete mSASP32. The absence of mSASP32 was confirmed by immunoblotting with mSASP-C pAb. After removal of mSASP32-bound beads, mSASP32-depleted SCE was then applied to the mSASP-PR2 pAb column and washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1 m NaCl, and bound mSASP15 was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.0. Eluted mSASP15 was immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.5, and concentrated with an Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter and tube (BioMax-5K NMWL; Millipore) and then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Mass Spectrometry—Molecular mass of purified mSASP15 was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra in a Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems), operated in the linear mode. For determination of C-terminal amino acid sequence of mSASP15, purified mSASP15 was subjected to proteolysis of lysyl endopeptidase at 35 °C for 20 h. This digest was desalted on a C18 Ziptip (Millipore), eluted in 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The rest of the lysyl endopeptidase digest was also desalted on C18 Ziptip and eluted in 50% acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid and subjected to nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nano-ESI MS) in a Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer (Waters Micromass, Manchester, UK). The selected precursor ion was further analyzed by nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nano-ESI MS/MS). In collision-induced dissociation experiments (collision gas argon, collision energy 30-40 eV), product ions were analyzed by the orthogonal TOF analyzer. Immunofluorescence—Mouse side skin was fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Next, samples were incubated with 10% sucrose in PBS for 3 h at 4 °C and then 20% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Finally, samples were mounted in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Fine-technical, Tokyo, Japan) and frozen on dry ice. Frozen samples were cut into 5-μm thick sections (10-μm sections for confocal imaging) on a cryostat and put on silan-coated glass slides and air-dried. These samples were soaked in Block-Ace blocking solution (Dainippon Pharmacy, Osaka, Japan) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated in primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and SYTOX Green (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies. Samples were washed three times with PBS and mounted in PBS containing 50% glycerol. Photographs were recorded using a photomicroscope with an Olympus IX70 through a cooled CCD camera (model ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu, Japan) controlled by Aquacosmos software (Hamamatsu Photonics). Confocal imaging was performed using LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (version 2.3; Carl Zeiss Inc., Jena, Germany). Purification of Recombinant mSASP15 (rmSASP15)—All procedures were performed at 4 °C, and chromatography was carried out on anÄKTAexplorer 10S chromatography system (GE Healthcare). We produced rmSASP15 via autoprocessing of GST-mSASP32 expressed in Escherichia coli. 500 ml of E. coli culture expressing GST-mSASP32 was collected by centrifugation, and cell pellets were dissolved in 9 ml of buffer H (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Nakalai Tesque, Japan). After sonication, samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was then frozen at -80 °C. 2 ml of supernatant was thawed and dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, 1 mm EDTA) by using NAP-10 (GE Healthcare). The sample was passed over a HiTrap SP HP, 1 ml (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After washing with 3 column volumes of buffer A, bound rmSASP15 was eluted with a 6-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.25 m) in buffer A, and fractions of 0.4 ml each were collected. Fractions containing rmSASP15 (fractions 1-16) were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA) and concentrated with Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter and tube (BioMax-5K NMWL; Millipore). Samples were passed over a Hitrap Q HP, 1 ml equilibrated with buffer B, and then washed with 3 column volumes of buffer B. Bound rmSASP15 was eluted with a 6-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.3 m) in buffer B. Fractions containing rmSASP15 (fractions 16-20) were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA) and concentrated as described above. Samples were then passed over a Hitrap SP HP, 1 ml equilibrated with buffer C, and washed with 3 column volumes of buffer C. Bound rmSASP15 was eluted with a 6-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.25 m) in buffer C. Purified rmSASP15 (fractions 13-22) was pooled and concentrated as described above. For gel filtration, purified rmSASP15 was fractionated (0.5 ml/min) by Superdex 75 HR 10/30 gel filtration chromatography (GE Healthcare) and equilibrated in buffer C, and fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected. Peptide Cleavage Assay—For determination of specific activity, purified rmSASP15 (130pmol) was incubated with 0.1 mm peptide substrate (Nma-LFANSMG-K(D-np)rrr-NH2) in 100 μl of buffer A (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.29, 0.15 m NaCl), buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.65, 0.15 m NaCl), or buffer C (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.38, 0.7 m NaCl) for indicated times at 37 °C. For determination of the optimum pH, purified rmSASP15 (25 pmol) was incubated with 0.1 mm peptide substrate in 100 μl of buffer D (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.32 or pH 4.96, 0.7 m NaCl) or buffer E (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.41-7.59, 0.7 m NaCl) for 60 min at 37 °C. All buffers contained 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture (Nakalai Tesque) that consisted of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, E-64, and leupeptin to completely inhibit the activities of serine and cysteine protease. After incubation, fluorescence was measured using a VICTOR2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the excitation and emission wavelengths at 355 and 460 nm, respectively. Specific activities were calculated according to the fluorescence of FRETS-25-STD1 and FRETS-25-STD2 (Peptide Inc.). Generation of Knock-out Mice—The mSASP gene is encoded by a single exon. The 2.2-kb fragment upstream of mSASP was amplified by genomic PCR using the following primers: 5′-AATTCCGCGGATCCTGGGCTGTAGCGTGAGTTTCAG-3′ and 5′-ATATCCCGGGATCTTGAACTTCAGGGAGCGACGTCCT-3′. The 7.7-kb fragment downstream of mSASP was amplified by genomic PCR using the primers 5′-AATTGTCGACAGCCAGGAATGTCAATCTTGAGAGAGGACC-3′ and 5′-AATTCCGCGGTTTGCCCCCCTCATCTCAGTGTTCTAGCTC-3′ from genomic DNA of J1 ES cells. These primers were designed from publicly available genomic DNA sequences around the mSASP gene locus. The targeting vector was constructed by ligating a 2.2-kb SacII/SmaI fragment and a 7.7-kb blunted fragment, which were located upstream and downstream of the single exon of mSASP to the pgk-neo cassette, respectively. J1 ES cells were electroporated with the targeting vector and selected in the presence of G418. The G418-resistant colonies were removed and screened by Southern blotting with the 3′ external probe (Fig. 5A). Correctly targeted ES clones were identified by an additional 2.7-kb band together with the 6.8-kb band of the wild type allele when digested with EcoRI. The targeted ES cells obtained were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, which were in turn transferred into BALB/c foster mothers to obtain chimeric mice. Male chimeras were mated with C57BL/6 females, and agouti offspring were genotyped to confirm the germ line transmission of the targeted allele. The littermates were genotyped by Southern blotting. Heterozygous mice were then interbred to produce homozygous mice. Removal of Hair—The mice were anesthetized, and hair was removed by shaving, and hair remover (Kanebo, Tokyo, Japan) was rubbed on. After 10 min, the hair remover was rubbed off, and Acid Care Lotion (Kanebo) was applied to the surface of the skin. Preparation of Cornified Envelopes—For preparation of cornified envelopes, the tip of the ear was cut, placed in water containing 25 mm dithiothreitol and 2% SDS, heated to 100 °C for 15 min, and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. Envelopes were examined in a hemocytometer under phase microscopy. Epidermal Protein Extraction and Immunoblot Analysis—The epidermis and dermis were separated by heating the skin for 5 min at 54 °C in 5 mm EDTA in PBS. Separated epidermis was extracted in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% glycerol, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Nakalai Tesque) followed by sonication on ice 5 times for 3 s and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The supernatant was used as epidermal extract. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred from gels onto nitrocellulose membranes that were then incubated with the first antibody. Bound antibodies were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and the appropriate substrate as described by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). To identify genes involved in epidermal differentiation, we previously performed “high throughput in situ hybridization screening” of ∼10,000 genes expressed in mouse skin and identified 116 unique clones that were expressed in a layer-specific manner in mouse foot pad epidermis (14Matsui T. Hayashi-Kisumi F. Kinoshita Y. Katahira S. Morita K. Miyachi Y. Ono Y. Imai T. Tanigawa Y. Komiya T. Tsukita S. Genomics. 2004; 84: 384-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Among them, we identified a novel cDNA fragment, SK082D11, of which the in situ hybridization signal was specifically detected in the granular layer (Fig. 1A). To obtain a full-length cDNA clone, the publicly available mouse EST data base was searched, and an EST was identified (BC057938) that contained the entire sequence of SK082D11 (Fig. 1B). Close comparison of BC057938 to the mouse genome data base revealed that 17 nucleotides of the 5′-end were not present. The deduced amino acid sequence of the corrected BC057938 revealed that it encoded 339 amino acids. Searching the publicly available data bases with these predicted amino acids revealed that it was a mouse homologue of human SASPase, a recently identified retroviral-like skin-specific aspartic protease (13Bernard D. Méhul B. Thomas-Collignon A. Delattre C. Donovan M. Schmidt R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 278-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The PROSITE search also predicted a retroviral type aspartic protease signature with aspartic acid 210 as the putative active amino acid site. At the amino acid sequence level, mSASP and hSASP showed 72% identity (Fig. 1C). Next, the expression of mSASP mRNA in various mouse tissues was examined by Northern blotting (Fig. 2A). The SK082D11 probe detected a strong 1.5-kb band in the stomach and skin and a weaker band in the lung. Furthermore, we examined the expression of mSASP by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2B). In good agreement with the Northern blot findings, mSASP mRNA was highly expressed in stratified epithelia such as the skin, tongue, esophagus, forestomach, and vagina. It was further expressed in the trachea and urinary bladder as well as in the thymus. It was undetectable in typical simple epithelia such as the liver and small intestine. In mouse embryonic development, mSASP mRNA expression was first detected at embryonic day 15.5, which coincided well with the emergence of epidermal stratification (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Expression patterns of mouse SASPase mRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2019666743,"Neuronal microtubules are stabilized by two calmodulin-regulated microtubule-associated proteins, E-STOP and N-STOP, which when suppressed in mice induce severe synaptic and behavioral deficits. Here we show that mature neurons also contain a 21-kDa STOP-like protein, SL21, which shares calmodulin-binding and microtubule-stabilizing homology domains with STOP proteins. Accordingly, in different biochemical or cellular assays, SL21 has calmodulin binding and microtubule stabilizing activity. However, in cultured hippocampal neurons, SL21 antibodies principally stain the somatic Golgi and punctate Golgi material in neurites. In cycling cells, transfected SL21 decorates microtubules when expressed at high levels but is otherwise principally visible at the Golgi. The Golgi targeting of SL21 depends on the presence of cysteine residues located within the SL21 N-terminal domain, suggesting that Golgi targeting may require SL21 palmitoylation. Accordingly we find that SL21 is palmitoylated in vivo. N-STOP and E-STOP, which contain the Golgi targeting sequences present in SL21, also display distinct Golgi staining when expressed at low level in cycling cells. Thus neuronal proteins of the STOP family have the capacity to associate with Golgi material, which could be important for STOP synaptic functions.

Neurons contain abundant subpopulations of stable microtubules that resist depolymerizing conditions such as exposure to the cold. This property is due to microtubule association with E-and N-STOP 2The abbreviations used are: STOP, stable tubule only polypeptide; SL21, 21-kDa STOP-like protein; aa, amino acid(s); DIV, days (of differentiation) in vitro; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.2The abbreviations used are: STOP, stable tubule only polypeptide; SL21, 21-kDa STOP-like protein; aa, amino acid(s); DIV, days (of differentiation) in vitro; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium., two neuronal calmodulin-binding and calmodulin-regulated proteins (1Andrieux A.

STOP proteins are important for synaptic function and STOP null mice present defects in both short- and long-term synaptic plasticity, associated with severe behavioral and neurotransmitter deficits (1Andrieux A.

At the ultrastructural level, the main signature of STOP suppression is a dramatic depletion of synaptic vesicle pools in glutamatergic neurons. E- and N-STOP arise from mRNA splicing of a single gene (5Denarier E. Aguezzoul M. Jolly C. Vourc'h C. Roure A. Andrieux A. Bosc C. Job D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These STOP proteins contain modular motifs (3Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that are either bifunctional (calmodulin-binding and microtubule-stabilizing sequences, Mc and Mn modules, respectively) or are comprised of calmodulin-binding sequences, unrelated to microtubule-stabilizing sequences. We have previously described a number of STOP splicing variants, which are principally present in non-neuronal cells (6Galiano M.R. Bosc C. Schweitzer A. Andrieux A. Job D. Hallak M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but for a long time, STOPs seemed to be unique with no STOP-related proteins. However, strong evidence for a 21-kDa STOP-like protein (SL21) has arisen from data base searches (3Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SL21 contains a 35-amino acid (aa) N-terminal stretch that shares 83% homology with the N-terminal part of E- or N-STOP and contains a calmodulin-binding motif. A second domain of SL21, spanning 24 aa, shares 71% homology with a microtubule-stabilizing Mn module of E- and N-STOP (3Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12125-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that SL21 is a neuronal protein, strictly expressed in the postnatal brain. We show that SL21 has microtubule stabilizing activity similar to E- and N-STOP. However, surprisingly, endogenous SL21 co-localizes with the somatic Golgi apparatus and with dendritic Golgi structures in cultured hippocampal neurons. We show that the N-terminal part of SL21 comprises a Golgi-targeting sequence with critical cysteine residues, which sustain SL21 palmitoylation. The SL21 Golgi targeting sequence is also present and functional in E-and N-STOP. Thus, in light of studies indicating that the presence of Golgi material in neurites and synapses may be important for synaptic plasticity (8Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), Golgi interactions with STOP could be important for STOP function in synapses. Sequence Analysis—Mouse N-STOP protein sequence (GenBank™ accession number CAA75930) was submitted to the BLAST program to identify STOP-related proteins. GenBank™ accession numbers of these proteins are CAA63762 for rat N-STOP, NP_149052 for human N-STOP, XP_508647 for chimpanzee N-STOP, XP_596995 for cow N-STOP, NP_941001 for mouse SL21, XP_344040 for rat SL21, AAH06434 for human SL21, XP_516902 for chimpanzee SL21, and XP_608343 for cow SL21. Protein sequence alignments were performed using the multiple alignment software ClustalW (9Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55635) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs—On the basis of the mouse SL21 cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number BY727771), the entire open reading frame of mouse SL21 was amplified by PCR. We used mouse brain Marathon Ready cDNA (BD Biosciences) and the Advantage-GC2 polymerase mix (BD Biosciences) with primers containing BglII extensions. The resulting PCR product was first cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). For expression in mammalian cells, the complete coding sequence was cloned in pSG5 vector (Stratagene) and in pcDNA3.1(-)/Myc-His-A vector (Invitrogen) to be fused with the myc epitope DNA. For production and purification in the bacterial system, the complete coding sequence was cloned into pGex-4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to fuse GST after the last amino acids of SL21. The two SL21 deletion mutants, obtained by PCR, correspond to Met + aa 35-191 (SL21Δ2-34) and to aa 1-122 + aa 146-191 (SL21ΔMn3) according to the numbering of mouse SL21 protein. The replacement of Cys5, Cys10, and Cys11 by glycine residues (SL21-C(5/10/11)G) was obtained by PCR, with a degenerate 5′-oligonucleotide (5′-AgA TCT ATg gCg Tgg CCC ggC ATC AgC Cgg CTA ggC ggC CTg gCC-3′). The STOP coding sequence of LNtΔMn1Mn2, corresponding to aa 1-123 + Ala + aa 139-161 + Ile-Gln + aa 175-225 according to the numbering of rat N-STOP, was amplified by PCR and then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(-)/Myc-His-A vector to be fused with the myc epitope DNA. N-STOP plasmid was described previously (2Guillaud L. Bosc C. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Denarier E. Pirollet F. Lafanechère L. Job D. J.

The STOP coding sequence of N-STOPΔ2-19, corresponding to Met + aa 20-952 according to the numbering of rat N-STOP, was amplified by PCR and then subcloned into the pSG5 vector. All of the SL21 and STOP constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Production of SL21-GST—Plasmid pGex-4T3 containing SL21 cDNA was transformed in One Shot BL21 (DEA3) Star cells (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformed cells expressing SL21-GST were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6, and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (Complete Mixture tablets, Roche Applied Science), and sonicated for 1.5 min before centrifugation (17,000 × g for 10 min). The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. These beads were placed in columns and successively washed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, then with PBS, and finally with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The GST fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Western Blot Analysis—Tissues from mice were homogenized in a 100 mm K-Pipes, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 buffer, pH 6.65. The homogenates were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then harvested and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and processed as described previously (12Lieuvin A. Labbé J.C. Dorée M. Job D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Sedimentation of Proteins with Microtubules—All proteins were preclarified at 150,000 × g for 15 min in a TL-100 Ultracentrifuge at 4 °C prior to the start of experiments. STOP proteins were purified as described in Pirollet et al. (13Pirollet F. Derancourt J. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8849-8855Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A microtubule-binding assay was performed as in Masson and Kreis (14Masson D. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using taxol-stabilized microtubules (4 μm) as substrates and a 60% glycerol cushion. Assay of Calmodulin Binding to Immobilized Peptide—Immobilized peptide arrays corresponding to the human SL21 were produced according to Frank (15Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (924) Google Scholar) with an ABIMED ASP 222 automated SPOT robot. The protein sequence was subdivided into 15-mer peptides with an overlap of 12 aa. The peptides were synthesized spot-wise as an array on a specially manufactured cellulose membrane (AIMS Scientific Products GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany). The peptides are permanently linked to the membrane through their carboxyl terminal aa via a polyethylene glycol spacer. The synthesis procedure followed exactly that of Frank and Overwin (16Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). Overlay binding assay were performed as described elsewhere (3Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), using 35S-labeled calmodulin. Cell Culture—Hippocampal cell cultures were prepared as described previously (17Dotti C.G. Sullivan C.A. Banker G.A. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1454-1468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi brain tissue from E18.5 (embryonic day 18.5) mice were removed and digested in 0.25% trypsin in Hepes-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C for 15 min. After manual dissociation, cells were plated at a concentration of 5,000-15,000 cells/cm2 on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated cover-slips, in DMEM-10% fetal bovine serum. One hour after plating, the medium was changed to DMEM containing B27 and N2 supplements (Invitrogen). HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in RPMI-Glutamax or DMEM-Glutamax supplement, respectively, with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transient Transfection and Analysis of Microtubule Stability—Exponentially growing HeLa or NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the cDNAs described above using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were either directly processed for immunofluorescence or exposed to cold temperatures (30 min on ice) or to nocodazole (20 μm for 30 min). Cells were then permeabilized in lysis buffer (30 mm Pipes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 6.75) for 1 min and processed for immunofluorescence. Antibodies—Primary antibodies were: mAb against α-tubulin (TUB2.1) diluted to 1/100 (Sigma); rat mAb against tyrosinated tubulin (YL1/2) diluted to 1/5,000 (18Wehland J. Willingham M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1476-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); mAb against GM130 diluted to 1/50 and against GS28 diluted to 1/200 (BD Transduction Laboratories); rabbit polyclonal antibody against giantin (Covance) diluted to 1/2,000; rabbit polyclonal antibody 23C against STOP (2Guillaud L. Bosc C. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Denarier E. Pirollet F. Lafanechère L. Job D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) diluted to 1/400. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies 3315 were raised against synthetic peptide FQVPEVRKFTPNPSAI, corresponding to aa 164-179 of mouse SL21 (Eurogentec). Serum 3315 was affinity-purified with the corresponding peptide and used diluted to 1/4000 and to 1/400 for Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis, respectively. Secondary antibodies were: anti GST peroxidase-coupled (Santa Cruz); anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Molecular probes)- or Cy5-coupled antibodies, anti-rabbit Cy3-coupled antibodies, and anti-rat Alexa 488-coupled (Jackson ImmunoResearch) antibodies. Immunofluorescence—Hippocampal neurons were then either permeabilized in OPT buffer (80 mm Pipes, pH 6.7, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) at 35 °C for 2 min before fixation or were fixed directly for 10 min in methanol at -20 °C. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 45 min in PBS-Tween 0.5% and with secondary antibodies for 40 min. Cells were analyzed with a laser confocal microscope (TCS-SP2, Leica) or with an inverted microscope Axioscop 50 (Zeiss) controlled by Metaview (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Images were digitalized using a Coolsnap ES camera (Roper Scientific). [3H]Palmitate Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were either nontransfected or transfected with SL21-myc or SL21 C(5/10/11)G-myc cDNAs. One day after transfection, cells were labeled for 3 h with 500 μCi of [3H]palmitic acid (Amersham Biosciences). The radioactive palmitic acid was completely dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 12.5 μl of Me2SO, and complemented with 1 ml of RPMI containing 0,5% defatted bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Cells were washed and scraped with PBS. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min, cells were lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0,05% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete Mixture tablets, Roche Applied Science) and 5 mm CaCl2. After centrifugation of the cell lysate at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was supplement with 5 mm EGTA and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 25 μl of myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) preincubated for 2 h at 4°C with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min, the immunoprecipitates were washed five times in IP buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and gels were fixed for 30 min in 50% methanol-10% acetic acid and then treated for 30 min with Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences) to improve the radioactive signal. The gels were dried and exposed on autoradiographic films for 10 days at -80 °C. STOP Homology Domains in SL21—E- and N-STOP contains two classes of bifunctional calmodulin-binding (Mc) and -stabilizing modules (Mn) (Fig. 1A). E- and N-STOP also contain additional calmodulin-binding sequences unrelated to Mn or Mc modules (Fig. 1A). The first 35 aa of SL21 share 83% homology with the N-terminal aa of E- and N-STOP, which comprises, in STOPs, the functional calmodulin-binding motif called Cam1 (3Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A second domain of SL21, spanning 24 aa, shares 71% homology with the E- and N-STOP bifunctional calmodulin-binding (Cam5) and microtubule-stabilizing Mn3 module (3Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The homologous domains of N-STOP and SL21 are aligned (Fig. 1B). Calmodulin-binding Properties of SL21—All of the STOP calmodulin-binding sites including Cam1 and Cam5 were initially identified as calmodulin-binding motifs on N-STOP immobilized peptide arrays (3Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A similar assay with SL21 peptides (Fig. 2, A and B) showed that the STOP Cam1 and Cam5 homologous motifs of SL21 (SL-Cam1 and SL-Cam3, respectively), also bound [35S]calmodulin (Fig. 2, B and C, peaks 1 and 3) together with two other apparently weaker calmodulin-binding motifs, SL-Cam2 and SL-Cam4, peaks 2 and 4 respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). Calmodulin-binding motifs in N-STOP have been shown to bind to immobilized Ca2+-calmodulin in vitro (3Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Accordingly, four independents experiments consistently showed that recombinant SL21-GST bound to calmodulin column, as illustrated in Fig. 2D. The binding was strictly dependent on the presence of calcium as shown by the release of SL21 from the calmodulin column by EGTA buffer (Fig. 2D) and by the nonbinding of SL21 to calmodulin column in the absence of calcium (Fig. 2D). The binding of SL21-GST to calmodulin is mediated by SL21, as GST alone was unable to bind to immobilized calmodulin (data not shown). Thus, SL21 behaves as a bona fide calmodulin-binding protein in vitro. Microtubule Binding and Stabilizing Activity of SL21—In E- and N-STOP, Mn modules mediate STOP association with microtubules with resulting inhibition of microtubule depolymerization upon exposure to the cold or to nocodazole (3Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In agreement with the presence of an Mn module sequence in SL21, SL21 co-sedimented with taxol-stabilized microtubules in standard microtubule binding assays while remaining in the soluble fraction in the absence of microtubules (Fig. 3A). In the same microtubule binding assay, N-STOP co-sedimented with microtubules, whereas GST remained in the supernatant. In quantitative experiments, various amount of tubulin were polymerized and then incubated with SL21-GST at 2 μm. Then, polymerized tubulin was pelleted, and SL21 content was analyzed on immunoblots, in both supernatants and pellets (Fig. 3B). The concentrations of tubulin at which approximately half of SL21 cosedimented with microtubules was ∼5 μm (Fig. 3B). In additional experiments, SL21-GST at various concentrations was mixed with polymerized tubulin (10 μm). Then, microtubules were pelleted, and SL21 content was analyzed on immunoblots in both supernatants and pellets (Fig. 3C). In this experiment, SL21 at 4 μm was found both in the supernatant and in the pellet, whereas at concentration of SL21, ranging from 2 to 0.5 μm, SL21 was only found associated with microtubules. Altogether these results showed that SL21 behaves as a microtubule-binding protein in vitro. We used HeLa cells for microtubule-binding and -stabilization tests in vivo. HeLa cells are devoid of STOP, of SL21, and of cold-stable or nocodazole-resistant microtubules (Fig. 3D). When transfected in HeLa cells, a SL21 mutant (SL21Δ2-34) lacking the N-terminal domain and containing the Mn module decorated cytoplasmic microtubules and induced both microtubule cold stability and microtubule resistance to nocodazole (Fig. 3E), compatible with the functionality of the Mn module of SL21 in vivo. As shown below, the behavior of the full-length SL21 in cells was more complex than the mutant lacking the N-terminal domain (SL21Δ2-34) due to the interfering influence of the N-terminal sequence. Tissue Distribution and Cellular Localization of Endogenous SL21—We used Western blot analysis of mouse tissues with SL21 polyclonal antibody 3315 to determine the distribution pattern of SL21. SL21 was only detected in brain tissue (Fig. 4A). In tissue extracts from newborn brain, SL21 expression was low at P0 and increased after P10 (Fig. 4A). We then tested the presence of SL21 in various neuronal cell lines, using both immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. SL21 was not detected in neuronal cell lines (N2A, PC12, and NG108) whether cultured in the presence or absence of nerve growth factor (data not shown). In contrast, SL21 was present in neurons in primary cultures but absent from glial cells (data not shown). Interestingly, in differentiating hippocampal cultured neurons, SL21 antibodies principally stained a juxtanuclear structure corresponding to the somatic Golgi apparatus, as demonstrated by co-localization with the cis-Golgi marker GS28 (Fig. 4B). At late stages of neuronal differentiation in vitro (16 DIV), in addition to the somatic Golgi, both SL21 and GS28 antibodies yielded a punctuated staining of neuritic extensions (Fig. 4B), corresponding to staining of neurite vesicular Golgi (19Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A distinct microtubule staining was also visible after Triton-soluble protein extraction (Fig. 4D). Disruption of the somatic Golgi with brefeldin A treatment in differentiated neurons induced a dramatic redistribution of SL21 and GS28 stainings, both of which became diffuse (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that SL21 is specifically expressed in differentiated neuronal cells and that it localizes to microtubules, to the somatic Golgi, and to Golgi material traveling throughout neurites. Dual Localization of Transfected SL21 in NIH 3T3 Cells Resulting from Microtubule- and Golgi-targeting Sequences in SL21—We used NIH 3T3 cells, which have a well organized somatic Golgi, and SL21 mutants for further analysis of SL21 localization and domain structure. When expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, the apparent localization of SL21 varied as a function of its expression level. At low levels of expression, SL21 was principally detectable on the Golgi (Fig. 5A). At higher levels of expression, there was also distinct SL21 staining of cytoplasmic microtubules (Fig. 5B). The deletion of the Mn module (SL21ΔMn) suppressed the microtubule association of SL21 at all expression levels, while preserving Golgi localization (Fig. 5C). Conversely, at all levels of expression in NIH 3T3 cells, a deletion mutant of SL21 lacking 34 N-terminal amino acids (SL21Δ2-34) associated with microtubules (data not shown), as in the case of HeLa cells (Fig. 3F), with no Golgi localization. In additional microtubule stabilization assays in HeLa cells, we found that native SL21 expressed at high levels and the SL21Δ2-34 deletion mutant had microtubule stabilizing activity, whereas the SL21 mutant SL21ΔMn, which showed exclusive Golgi localization, had no detectable effect on microtubule stability (not shown). Altogether, these results indicate that the targeting of SL21 to microtubules depends on the presence of the Mn module and that SL21 comprises a Golgi-targeting sequence located in the N-terminal domain of the protein. Palmitoylation of SL21—Palmitoylation is often required for protein association with membranes and has been observed previously in neuronal proteins associated with tubulin and with the Golgi, such as SCG10 (20Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation occurs at cysteine residues surrounded with basic residues (21Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Mouse SL21 contains three cysteine residues, all located in the Golgitargeting domain (positions 5, 10 and 11) and surrounded by basic residues (Fig. 6A). To assess whether these cysteines were involved in the localization of SL21 to the Golgi apparatus, we produced cDNAs encoding SL21 mutants in which Cys5, Cys10, and Cys11 were replaced by glycine residues. These constructs were then transfected in NIH 3T3 cells, and the Golgi localization of the mutants was examined. In contrast to SL21, which localizes to the Golgi, the SL21 mutant where all the three cysteine residues were replaced (SL21-C(5/10/11)G), did not localize to the Golgi but co-localized with microtubules (Fig. 5D). These results indicate a requirement of SL21 N-terminal Cys5, Cys10, and Cys11 for proper localization of SL21 to Golgi apparatus. To test SL21 palmitoylation directly, HeLa cells were incubated with [3H]palmitate with or without prior transfection with SL21-myc or SL21-C(5/10/11)G-myc cDNA. Then, SL21-myc and SL21-C(5/10/11)G-myc were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed both by Western blot, using SL21 polyclonal antibody 3315, and by autoradiography (Fig. 5E). As shown in Fig. 5E, SL21 incorporated 3H, whereas SL21-C(5/10/11)G mutant did not, demonstrating that SL21 is indeed palmitoylated in cells and showing the crucial role of Cys5, Cys10, and Cys11 in this process. These results were obtained for three independent experiments, and similar results were observed when using SL21-GFP instead of SL21-myc (data not shown). Golgi Targeting of N-STOP—The N-terminal Golgi-targeting sequence of SL21, which is conserved among mammals, is also present at the N terminus of N-STOP (Fig. 6A). Accordingly, a 225-aa N-terminal fragment of N-STOP containing the Golgitargeting sequence and deleted for microtubule-binding modules Mn1 and Mn2 (LNtΔMn1Mn2) was uniformly addressed to the Golgi when transfected in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 6B). Despite the presence of such a functional Golgi-targeting sequence at their N terminus, E- and N-STOP have not been detected at the Golgi in previous studies, which could be due either to a dominant influence of the STOP microtubule-targeting sequences (Mn and Mc modules) or to unfavorable experimental procedures. To test these possibilities, we reexamined N-STOP localization in various cell types and conditions. In neurons, STOP antibody yielded a bright staining of the whole cell body, making a possible STOP localization at the Golgi difficult to detect (2Guillaud L. Bosc C. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Denarier E. Pirollet F. Lafanechère L. Job D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in NIH 3T3 cells, transfected N-STOP staining was principally detectable at the Golgi at low levels of expression (Fig. 6C), with both Golgi and microtubule staining being present at high expression levels (Fig. 6D). Moreover, a transfected N-STOP mutant (N-STOPΔ2-19) lacking the Golgi targeting sequence failed to associate with the Golgi (Fig. 6E). Altogether, these results indicate that the ability to localize to Golgi material is a shared property of STOP and STOP-like proteins, because of the presence of a Golgi-targeting sequence in their shared N-terminal domain. In this study, SL21 and neuronal STOPs (E-STOP and N-STOP) emerge as a class of microtubule- and calmodulin-binding proteins, sharing both a Golgi-targeting sequence and microtubule-stabilizing modules. We note that the STOP Golgi-targeting sequence is only present in E- and N-STOP and is absent from all of the other known STOP variants (6Galiano M.R. Bosc C. Schweitzer A. Andrieux A. Job D. Hallak M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As are E- and N-STOP, SL21 is specific to neurons, and both SL21 and N-STOP are expressed only in the postnatal brain. Despite such similarities in structure and activity, there is an apparent difference in the cellular distribution of endogenous SL21 and N-STOP in neurons, with SL21 preferentially associated with the somatic Golgi and N-STOP with microtubules. However both SL21 and N-STOP are detected principally at the Golgi when expressed at low levels in cells, whereas they are also visible on cytoplasmic microtubules at high levels of expression. The apparent differences between endogenous SL21 and N-STOP localization in neurons may thus reflect differences in expression levels, with N-STOP probably much more abundant than SL21. Superimposed cell regulations may also affect SL21 or STOP localization. The Golgi targeting of SL21 and of STOP most likely depends on palmitoylation, which is a regulated and reversible covalent protein modification (22Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 107-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Also, the microtubule binding activity of Mn modules can be inhibited by calmodulin (24Job D. Fischer E.H. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4679-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and, in the case of STOP, through phosphorylation, opening the possibility of a protein shift from microtubules to other cell compartments (25Baratier J. Peris L. Brocard J. Gory-Faure S. Dufour F. Bosc C. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Blanchoin L. Salin P. Job D. Andrieux A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 28: 19561-19569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Why should neurons contain specific microtubule-associated proteins with Golgi binding activity? The somatic Golgi in neurons has an organization similar to that observed in nonneuronal cells, although the Golgi orients toward the longest dendrite, and this Golgi polarity precedes the asymmetric dendrite growth (26Horton A.C. Racz B. Monson E.E. Lin A.L. Weinberg R.J. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2005; 48: 757-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Additionally there is evidence for the presence of Golgi material along neurites. Previous ultrastructural studies have reported membranes analogous to Golgi cisternae within the spines of distal dendrites (27Pierce J.P. van Leyen K. McCarthy J.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 311-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 28Pierce J.P. Mayer T. McCarthy J.B. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 351-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover many neurons possess both somatic Golgi and discrete, discontinuous Golgi-type structures (“Golgi outposts”) located far into the dendrites. These Golgi outposts are mobiles structures and are positioned to serve particular dendrites regions or sets of synapses, where they may be important for synaptic plasticity (8Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6188-6199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Golgi binding may therefore be important for the function of N-STOP in synaptic plasticity (1Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Fauré S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Additionally, palmitoylation may allow STOP interaction with vesicular or membrane material other than the Golgi (29el-Husseini Ael D. Bredt D.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and may thereby be central to the dramatic effects of STOP suppression on the synaptic vesicle density (1Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Fauré S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, palmitoylation has specifically been shown to play a role in neuronal protein trafficking and in the clustering of receptors and the associated scaffolding proteins at synapses (29el-Husseini Ael D. Bredt D.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 30Huang K. El-Husseini A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). According to the present study, SL21 and STOP have extensively overlapping activities. Yet, STOP suppression is not compensated by SL21 in STOP-deficient mice, and we have not detected any obvious modification in SL21 expression (data not shown). What is the utility of SL21 in the presence of STOP? We have performed SL21 small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments in hippocampal neurons, with inconclusive results (data not shown). It is likely that, as for N-STOP, SL21 function will be revealed by its suppression in whole animals, where complex aspects of synaptic function can be investigated. STOP or SL21 null animals may offer exciting models in which to test the role of the Golgi in integrated brain functions. We thank A. Schweitzer and N. Collomb for technical assistance; Y. Saoudi for help in imaging; and Julien Fauré, Jacques Brocard, and J. C. Deloulme for helpful discussions."

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3603-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). AGT is principally produced by the liver and cleaved by renin from the kidney to form angiotensin I, which is then further processed by angiotensin-converting enzyme to form angiotensin II. The existence of an intrarenal RAS is now generally accepted (15Dzau V.J. Ingelfinger J.R. J. Hypertens. 1989; 7: 53-58Google Scholar, 16Johnston C.I. Fabris B. Jandeleit K.

Recombinant hnRNP K bound to rAGT-IRE, as shown by a gel mobility shift assay (GMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Overexpression of hnRNP K attenuated rAGT mRNA expression and rAGT gene promoter activity in IRPTCs. In contrast, down-expression of hnRNP K by small interference RNA enhanced rAGT gene expression. Moreover, hnRNP K was pulled down and co-immunoprecipitated with hnRNP F. Co-transfection of hnRNP K and hnRNP F further suppressed rAGT mRNA expression. Finally, in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that high glucose or hyperglycemia increased and insulin inhibited hnRNP K expression in rat kidney proximal tubular cells. These experiments demonstrated that 65-kDa hnRNP K is a nuclear protein that binds to the rat AGT gene promoter and modulates AGT gene expression in the kidneys. d(+)-glucose, d-mannitol, and insulin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd.

Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar) were synthesized by Invitrogen, as reported previously (35Wei C.C. Guo D.F. Zhang S.L. Ingelfinger J.R. Chan J.S.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 616-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing the concatemeric wide type and mutant rAGT-IRE motif DNAs were constructed by inserting the double-stranded concatemeric wide type or mutant rAGT-IRE motif oligonucleotide with the NotI enzyme restriction site added on both termini into the polyclonal site of pcDNA 3.1 by conventional methodology. The double-stranded concatemeric wide type or mutant rAGT-IRE motif DNA fragment was then excised from the plasmid and treated with alkaline phosphatase and used for labeling as probe. Cellular Nuclear Extract Preparation—IRPTCs from passages 12–18 were utilized. The characteristics of IRPTCs, which express the mRNA and protein of rAGT, renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensin II receptors, have been described previously (41Ingelfinger J.R. Jung F. Diamant D. Haveran L. Lee E. Brem A. Tang S.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F218-F227PubMed Google Scholar). IRPTC nuclear extracts were prepared from 20 plates (150 × 20 mm), each containing confluent IRPTCs previously incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5 mm glucose plus 20 mm d-mannitol, 25 mm glucose, or 25 mm glucose plus insulin (10–7 m) for 24 h according to the method of Hennighausen and Lubon (42Hennighausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) with slight modifications (34Chen X. Zhang S.L. Pang L. Filep J.G. Tang S.S. Ingelfinger J.R. Chan J.S.D.

Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out with the IPGphor isoelectric focusing unit (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (35Wei C.C. Guo D.F. Zhang S.L. Ingelfinger J.R. Chan J.S.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 616-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional separation, the IPG strips were placed above 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and electrophoresed (SDS-PAGE) (35Wei C.C. Guo D.F. Zhang S.L. Ingelfinger J.R. Chan J.S.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 616-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Amersham Biosciences rainbow markers served as molecular weight markers. IRPTC nuclear extracts (100 μg) were run on the same 10% SDS-PAGE as the controls. Each sample was divided into two strips for two-dimensional electrophoresis. One gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Amresco Inc., Solon, OH) to visualize proteins. The other was electrotransferred to a Hybond C-extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for Southwestern blotting. Southwestern Blotting—Southwestern blotting was performed according to the procedure of Kwast-Welfeld et al. (43Kwast-Welfeld J. Belle I. Walker P.R. Whitfield J.F. Sikorska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19581-19585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications (34Chen X. Zhang S.L. Pang L. Filep J.G. Tang S.S. Ingelfinger J.R. Chan J.S.D.

Briefly, IRPTC nuclear proteins (200 μg) were resolved on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gradient or on 10% SDS-PAGE (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207180) Google Scholar) and then electrotransferred to a Hybond C-extra mem-brane. The membrane was in-cubated with 10% (w/v) nonfat milk proteins and then washed at least twice with binding buffer containing 0.25% nonfat milk proteins. Subsequently, it was hybridized overnight with 32P-labeled rAGT-IRE DNA (∼1.0–2.0 pmol; 106 cpm/ml) in binding buffer containing 0.25% non-fat milk proteins and 300 μg/ml nondenatured herring sperm DNA at 4 °C. The membrane was finally washed, air-dried, and exposed for autoradiography. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS)—Spots on the gel corresponding to positive signals of the Southwestern blot membrane were picked up for MALDI-MS. All MALDI-MS analyses were performed at the Quebec Genome Centre (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Briefly, protein samples were first cleaved by trypsin and then subjected to MALDI-MS. MALDI-MS analysis was conducted at 20 kV accelerating voltage and 23 kV reflecting voltage. For protein identification, peptide mass finger-prints were searched by the Mascot program developed by Matrix Science Ltd. (freely accessible on the World Wide Web at www.matrixscience.com). Expression of Recombinant hnRNP K—Murine hnRNP K cDNA (36Seuningen I.V. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X.R. Sleath P.R. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), with the NotI enzyme restriction site added on the 5′ and 3′ ends of sense and antisense primers, respectively, was subcloned at the polyclonal site (NotI) of the bacterial expression vector pGex 4T-3 by conventional methodology. E. coli BL-21 cells (Amersham Biosciences) were transformed by pGex 4T-3 containing hnRNP K cDNA. Expression of the fusion protein (GST fused with hnRNP K (GST-hnRNP K)) in BL-21 cells was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside in the culture medium with incubation for 4 h at 37°C. The bacteria were then harvested, and GST-hnRNP K fusion proteins were purified from the bacterial extracts by GST affinity column chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The purified GST-hnRNP K fusion proteins were tested in GMSAs. GMSAs—These assays were performed according to the methodology described elsewhere (34Chen X. Zhang S.L. Pang L. Filep J.G. Tang S.S.

Nephrol. 2005; 16: 616-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), employing labeled rAGT-IRE DNA as probe. Briefly, the rAGT-IRE DNA fragment was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Purified GST-hnRNP K fusion proteins (1.5 μg) or GST (5 μg) in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI/dC) in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm spermidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol (v/v) were incubated for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, the 5′-labeled probe (∼0.1 pmol) was added and further incubated for 45 min on ice. The mixture was run on 6% (w/v) nondenaturing PAGE and exposed for autoradiography. In competition assays, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA fragments was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min on ice before incubation with the labeled probe. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP analysis was performed according to the methodology of Kuo and Allis (45Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) with slight modifications (46Ostrowski J. Kawata Y. Schullery D.S. Denisenko O.N. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3954-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.4 ml of 37% formaldehyde was added to 10 ml of overlaying medium of IRPTC culture for 15 min at 4 °C. After cross-linking, the cells were harvested, washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline in Eppendorf tubes, and then lysed with 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing the following inhibitors: 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 mm p-nitrophenol phosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. After one wash with immunoprecipitation buffer, the pellet was suspended in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer and sheared in a Branson sonicator with 10-s cycles, 1 pulsed and 1 continuous, for 10 min at an output 3 and 80% duty cycle. Pulldowns were done using anti-K protein antibody with or without blocking peptide (100 μm) and protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer without inhibitors. DNA was eluted twice from the beads with 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) for 15 min with periodic vortexing (at room temperature). Cross-linking was reversed by adding 1 μl of 10 mg/ml RNase and 5 m NaCl to a final concentration of 0.3 m and incubating the tubes at 65 °C for 4 h. After adding 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol, the pellet was precipitated overnight at –20 °C. DNA was pelleted and resuspended in 100 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8.0. Then 11 μl of 10× protein K buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.8, 50 mm EDTA, 5% SDS) and 1 μl of 20 μg/μl proteinase K were added and incubated at 45 °C for 2 h. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol, and the final DNA pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer. PCR amplifications were done in 50 μl of 1× PCR buffer containing DNA, 0.5 μm primers (forward primer (5′-CCT TGA TGC CTC CAA CAA CT-3′) and backward primer (5′-GGT GGG AGC TGA GAA GAC AG-3′), corresponding to nucleotides –1043 to –1026 and –718 to –698 of the rAGT gene promoter (47Chan J.S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2011737569,"Tissue factor, the physiologic trigger of blood clotting, is the membrane-anchored protein cofactor for the plasma serine protease, factor VIIa. Tissue factor is hypothesized to position and align the active site of factor VIIa relative to the membrane surface for optimum proteolytic attack on the scissile bonds of membrane-bound protein substrates such as factor X. We tested this hypothesis by raising the factor VIIa binding site above the membrane surface by creating chimeras containing the tissue factor ectodomain linked to varying portions of the membrane-anchored protein, P-selectin. The tissue factor/P-selectin chimeras bound factor VIIa with high affinity and supported full allosteric activation of factor VIIa toward tripeptidyl-amide substrates. That the active site of factor VIIa was raised above the membrane surface when bound to tissue factor/P-selectin chimeras was confirmed using resonance energy transfer techniques in which appropriate fluorescent dyes were placed in the active site of factor VIIa and at the membrane surface. The chimeras were deficient in supporting factor X activation by factor VIIa due to decreased kcat. The chimeras were also markedly deficient in clotting plasma, although incubating factor VII or VIIa with the chimeras prior to the addition of plasma restored much of their procoagulant activity. Interestingly, all chimeras fully supported tissue factor-dependent factor VII autoactivation. These studies indicate that proper positioning of the factor VII/VIIa binding site on tissue factor above the membrane surface is important for efficient rates of activation of factor X by this membrane-bound enzyme/cofactor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1978951191,"CadA, the Cd2+-ATPase from Listeria monocytogenes, belongs to the Zn2+/Cd2+/Pb2+-ATPase bacterial subfamily of P1B-ATPases that ensure detoxification of the bacteria. Whereas it is the major determinant of Listeria resistance to Cd2+, CadA expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae severely decreases yeast tolerance to Cd2+ (Wu, C. C., Bal, N., Pérard, J., Lowe, J., Boscheron, C., Mintz, E., and Catty, P. (2004) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 324, 1034–1040). This phenotype, which reflects in vivo Cd2+-transport activity, was used to select from 33 point mutations, shared out among the eight transmembrane (TM) segments of CadA, those that affect the activity of the protein. Six mutations affecting CadA were found: M149A in TM3; E164A in TM4; C354A, P355A, and C356A in TM6; and D692A in TM8. Functional studies of the six mutants produced in Sf9 cells revealed that Cys354 and Cys356 in TM6 as well as Asp692 in TM8 and Met149 in TM3 could participate at the Cd2+-binding site(s). In the canonical Cys-Pro-Cys motif of P1B-ATPases, the two cysteines act at distinct steps in the transport mechanism, Cys354 being directly involved in Cd2+ binding, while Cys356 seems to be required for Cd2+ occlusion. This confirms an earlier observation that the two equivalent Cys of Ccc2, the yeast Cu+-ATPase, also act at different steps. In TM4, Glu164, which is conserved among P1B-ATPases, may be required for Cd2+ release. Finally, analysis of the role of Cd2+ in the phosphorylation from ATP and from Pi of the mutants suggests that two Cd2+ ions are involved in the reaction cycle of CadA.

P-type ATPase is the generic name for a class of membrane proteins that pump cations against their electrochemical gradient at the expense of ATP. Whatever their origin, location, and ionic selectivity, P-type ATPases are thought to share the same overall fold and reaction mechanism. The P-type ATPase fold, determined to a few angstroms resolution in the Ca2+-ATPase SERCA1a (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), is made of two domains, one cytoplasmic, bearing the catalytic site, the other membranous, comprising the cation transport site(s). The P-type ATPase reaction mechanism can be reduced to a four-step process (Scheme 1) where vectorial events (cation binding (step 1) and cation release (step 3)) and chemical events (phosphorylation (step 2) and dephosphorylation (step 4)) alternate (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Kuhlbrandt W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 3Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 269-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 4Møller J.V. Nissen P. Sørensen T.L. le Maire M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The P1B-ATPases (nomenclature from data base maintained by K. B. Axelsen) constitute a subfamily that assures the transport of heavy metals like Cu+, Cu2+, Ag+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, or Co2+ (5Nies D.H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 313-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). They differ from most of the P-type ATPases by a smaller membranous domain made of 8 transmembrane helices instead of 10 and the presence at their NH2 terminus of 1–6 metal-binding domains (6Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 7Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Most of these NH2-terminal metal-binding domains are made of 70 amino acids comprising a Cys-X-X-Cys motif whose cysteines are directly involved in metal binding. In some cases, represented by the subgroup P1B-3, the NH2 terminus consists of a histidine-rich sequence (8Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). P-type ATPases possess in their membranous domain one or more sites which bind the cation(s) to be transported. These so-called transport sites have been mainly studied on Ca2+-, Na+/K+-, and H+/K+-ATPases (P2 subfamily) and H+-ATPases (P3 subfamily). It emerged from these studies that whatever the ionic selectivity of the pump, the transport site(s) involved at least three transmembrane helices, including those two that are directly linked to the catalytic loop. For instance, in SERCA1a, the Ca2+-transport sites involve amino acids from four trans-membrane helices (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). In the transport sites of P2- and P3-ATPases, Ca2+, Na+, K+, or H+, which are all hard Lewis acids, are bound to carbonyl, carboxyl, or hydroxyl groups, all hard Lewis bases, thereby verifying the principle of hard and soft acids and bases (9Pearson R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 3533-3539Crossref Scopus (8203) Google Scholar). For instance, in SERCA1a, the Ca2+-transport sites consist of Glu, Asp, Asn, and Thr, which bind Ca2+ through their side chain (10Andersen J. Vilsen B. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar), plus some hydrophobic amino acids, which participate through their backbone carbonyl group, and also a water molecule. Much less is known about the transport site of P1B-ATPases. Nevertheless, various early studies on Cu+/Ag+-ATPases suggested a key role of the cysteines of the Cys-Pro-Cys motif located in TM6, 6The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane helix; HA, hemagglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. the upstream transmembrane helix linked to the catalytic loop (11Forbes J.R.

This exemplifies once again the hard and soft acids and bases principle, soft Lewis acids (Cu+, Ag+) interacting with a soft Lewis base (S–) (9Pearson R.G. J. Am. Chem.

Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the two cysteines of the Cys-Pro-Cys motif are likely to play distinct roles in ion transport. In ATP7B, two mutations flanking the Cys-Pro-Cys motif were found to be responsible for Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive defect of copper transport. Expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the ATP7B mutants T977M and P922L were unable to complement a ccc2 mutant and had a reduced Fet3p activity, suggesting a defect in copper transport (11Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1663-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Not only TM6 but also TM8 is likely to be involved in the transport site of P1B-ATPases. Indeed, the toxic milk mouse considered as an animal model for Wilson disease was shown to bear a mutation in the murine ATP7B homologue. Located in TM8, this mutation, the replacement by valine of a methionine highly conserved in the P1B-1 subgroup, was shown to abolish Cu+-transport (21La Fontaine S.L. Firth S.D. Camakaris J.

Commun. 2001; 281: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A recent study used sequence alignments to predict which amino acids from TM6, TM7, and TM8 could constitute the transport site of P1B-ATPases, assuming that these transmembrane helices can play the same role as those forming the transport sites in P2- and P3-ATPases. Alignment of over 200 sequences revealed some amino acids in TM7 and TM8 that are conserved and were therefore used to define five P1B-ATPase subgroups. As these subgroups display different ionic selectivity, these amino acids were predicted as putative components of the transport site of P1B-ATPases (8Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The prediction has been verified for the Cu+/Ag+-ATPase CopA from Archeoglobus fulgidus, a member of subgroup IB-1, whose mutations at Tyr682 (TM7), Asn683 (TM7), Met711 (TM8), and Ser715 (TM8) were shown to severely affect ATPase activity and phosphoenzyme formation from ATP (23Mandal A.K. Yang Y. Kertesz T.M. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54802-54807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The inventory of the ATP7B mutations causing Wilson disease suggests that transmembrane segments other than TM6, TM7, or TM8 can participate in the transport site of the P1B-type ATPases. Indeed, among the 33 mutations of the transmembrane domain of ATP7B found in patients with Wilson disease, only 11 are located in TM6, TM7, or TM8 (see the Wilson disease data base). The experimental studies carried out so far on the transport site of P1B-ATPases have all focused on Cu+/Ag+-ATPases, which constitute the largest subgroup of heavy metal pumps known today. In the present study, we have searched for the amino acids involved in the transport site of CadA, the Cd2+-ATPase from L. monocytogenes, a member of subgroup P1B-2. To do so, we first used a phenotypic test in yeast to identify among 33 point mutations of the transmembrane domain of CadA those that affect Cd2+-transport. We then produced the selected mutants in Sf9 cells to assess how Cd2+ transport was affected. We found that (i) the two cysteines of the Cys-Pro-Cys motif (TM6) act at distinct steps of the transport process, Cys354 being directly involved in Cd2+ binding, whereas Cys356 is required for Cd2+ occlusion; (ii) Asp692 in TM8 would be directly involved in Cd2+ binding; (iii) Glu164 in TM4 would be required for Cd2+ release. In addition, we propose that two Cd2+ ions are involved in the reaction cycle of CadA. Molecular Biology Procedures—JM109 Escherichia coli strain was used for DNA subcloning and amplification. Restriction and modification enzymes were from Fermentas or Invitrogen. DNA fragments were isolated using the Gene Clean Spin kit (Q-Biogene). Plasmids were purified by anion exchange chromatography (Qiagen). Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). DNA sequencing was performed by Genome Express Inc. (Meylan, France). Yeast Manipulations—Yeast procedures are detailed in Ref. 24Wu C.C. Bal N. Pérard J. Lowe J. Boscheron C. Mintz E. Catty P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar. The yeast strain used in the present study, W303-1A (25Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), was transformed following the method of Kuo and Campbell (26Kuo C.L. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and grown at 30 °C, with continuous stirring at 200 rpm for liquid cultures. Yeast transformants were grown in synthetic minimal DOB medium (2% glucose, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, Q-Biogene) supplemented with dropout powder without uracil (CSM-URA, Q-Biogene). HA-tagged CadA mutants were expressed from a centromeric vector derived from pRS316 (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), under the control of the strong constitutive PMA1 promoter. The sensitivity to Cd2+ of the different mutants was determined by drop tests, and their expression level was assessed by immunodetection of the HA epitope on a membrane preparation. Protein Preparation and Detection—The wild-type and mutant CadA proteins were produced using the Bac-to-Bac™ Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). After 3 days of culture at 27 °C, 100 ml of cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 500 × g, 4 °C). The pellet was suspended in 18 ml of 10 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7), 10 μg/ml RNase, 20 μg/ml DNase I, half a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by potterization and the homogenate was complemented so as to reach 10 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7), 80 mm KCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose. The sample was centrifuged (1 h, 100,000 × g, 4 °C), and the P100 pellet corresponding to a crude membrane fraction was suspended in 3 ml of 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose. Aliquots were homogenized by potterization, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as standard. Immunodetection was carried out using the monoclonal antibody anti-HA-peroxidase (3F10) and the BM Chemiluminescence Western blotting kit from Roche Applied Science. ATPase Activity Measurements—ATPase activities were measured at 28 °C with continuous stirring, in a medium containing 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, 300 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, and 0.5 mg/ml of Sf9 membrane preparations. ATP hydrolysis was measured following NADH absorbance changes at 340 nm, using a coupled enzyme assay as described in Ref. 28Miras R. Cuillel M. Catty P. Guillain F. Mintz E. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar. Phosphorylations—The phosphoenzyme intermediates formed in the presence of 32Pi or [γ-32P]ATP were quantitated as a function of Cd2+ concentration. In the two types of reactions, the acid-quenched sample was submitted to an acidic SDS-PAGE as described by Weber and Osborn (29Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation signal was revealed by autoradiography and analyzed using the Optiquant Software (Cyclone, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Later, polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to check the amounts of loaded protein. Phosphorylations from Pi were performed at 25 °C in a medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of Sf9 membrane preparations, 50 mm MES pH 6, 10 mm MgCl2, 20% Me2SO, in the presence of CdCl2 or EGTA as indicated in the figure legend to Fig. 5. After 10-min incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was started by addition of 100 μm 32Pi at 10–100 μCi/nmol and stopped 10 min later by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 1 mm KH2PO4 in 7% trichloroacetic acid. Phosphorylations from ATP were performed at 0 °C in a medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of Sf9 membrane preparations, 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, and CdCl2 as indicated. The reaction was started by addition of 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP at 50–500 μCi/nmol and stopped 15 s later by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 1 mm KH2PO4 in 7% trichloroacetic acid. The present work aims to identify the amino acids of the CadA transmembrane domain that are involved in Cd2+ binding and release during the transport cycle. CadA Topology—The initial step of this study consisted of the proper delimitation of the transmembrane segments of CadA, using the results of 10 prediction programs and a comparison with the experimentally determined topology of a P1B-ATPase from Helicobacter pylori (30Melchers K. Weitzenegger T. Buhmann A. Steinhilber W. Sachs G. Schafer K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 446-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Eight transmembrane segments were defined, hereafter named TM1 to TM8, and we must emphasize the uncertainty concerning the delimitation of TM3 and TM4 as well as TM7 and TM8 (Fig. 1). Point mutations were performed on negatively charged (Asp, Glu), polar (Ser, Thr, and Asn), and sulfur-containing amino acids (Cys, Met) liable to coordinate Cd2+ or to participate in its interaction with CadA (Fig. 1). Phenotypic Sorting of CadA Mutants—Expression of CadA in S. cerevisiae was shown to strongly increase yeast sensitivity to Cd2+. As CadA was found inserted in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, this phenotype was explained by the toxicity of Cd2+ accumulated in this compartment (24Wu C.C. Bal N. Pérard J. Lowe J. Boscheron C. Mintz E. Catty P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the following, we used this phenotype as an assessment of in vivo Cd2+-transport activity to sort CadA mutants produced by site-directed mutagenesis. Three classes of mutants were defined (Fig. 1). Class 1 comprises all the mutants (27 of the 33 tested) that induce growth arrest at 1 μm Cd2+ as does the wild-type protein (24Wu C.C. Bal N. Pérard J. Lowe J. Boscheron C. Mintz E. Catty P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Class 3 comprises mutants that do not alter yeast response to Cd2+. The reference in this class is D398A, a mutant of the phosphorylation site (DKTGT) that does not transport Cd2+ (24Wu C.C. Bal N. Pérard J. Lowe J. Boscheron C. Mintz E. Catty P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To this class belong the mutants C354A and C356A of the Cys-Pro-Cys motif cysteines in TM6 and the mutant D692A in TM8. Class 2 was defined as intermediate between class 1 and class 3, as some mutants induce yeast growth arrest at 10 μm Cd2+. In this class are found the mutants M149A, E164A, and P355A, which belong to TM3, TM4, and TM6, respectively. The expression level of the mutants was assessed by immunodetection of the HA-epitope added at the COOH-terminal end of the protein. The mutants were all equally produced in yeast, whatever the class they belong to (Fig. 2). Functional Study of the Selected CadA Mutants—Yeast was a very efficient system for sorting 6 mutants from 33 and, according to the phenotype, C354A, C356A, and D692A (class 3) are expected to be unable to transport Cd2+, whereas in M149A, E164A, and P355A (class 2) lower transport efficiency is expected. To assess the role of each of these 6 amino acids in the Cd2+-transport cycle of CadA, in vitro biochemical studies of the mutants were necessary, and yeast was not well suited anymore. The main limitations were the low expression level of the proteins and the high endogenous ATPase activity of yeast membranes. This is the reason why the six mutants selected from the phenotypic test were produced in Sf9 cells for functional studies. In this system, all the mutants exhibited the same expression level and they were all studied in a crude membrane preparation. Four methods were used to assess the functionality of the mutants:limited proteolysis, activity measurements, phosphorylation from ATP, and phosphorylation from Pi. In all these experiments, the non-functional D398A mutant was used to measure the endogenous activity of membranes from transfected Sf9 cells. Limited Proteolysis—Limited proteolysis by trypsin was used to compare the conformational states of the mutants with that of CadA. As shown in Fig. 3 (lane D), the digestion pattern resulting from CadA proteolysis in the absence of ATP displays two major bands of about 46 and 10 kDa, as well as a doublet around 27 kDa. Considering the location of the HA tag at the COOH-terminal end of CadA, these bands could result from cleavages at the end of the A domain, at the end of the large cytoplasmic loop and in the N domain, respectively. The presence of 5 mm ATP clearly modifies the proteolysis profile of CadA (lane A) that displays only one proteolytic band of about 55 kDa resulting from a cleavage in the middle of the A domain. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, the six selected mutants display the same digestion patterns as CadA, indicating that mutations did not affect the overall conformation of the protein and that all the mutants are able to bind ATP. ATPase Activity Measurements—A membrane fraction from Sf9 cells expressing CadA displays a Cd2+-dependent ATPase activity of about 50 nmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min and mg of protein. This value results from two effects of Cd2+, which on the one hand inhibits the endogenous ATPase activity, as illustrated in the membrane fraction containing the non-functional D398A mutant, and on the other hand activates CadA (Ref. 31Bal N. Mintz E. Guillain F. Catty P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and Fig. 4). ATPase activity measurements on membrane fractions from Sf9 cells expressing the various mutants showed that two of the mutants, C354A and D692A, were inactive. The other four mutants M149A, E164A, P355A, and C356A all displayed an ATPase activity in the same Cd2+ concentration range as CadA. The maximal activities were lower than that of CadA and ranged from 10 nmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min and per mg of protein for M149A and P355A to 20 for C356A and 40 for E164A. ATPase activity measurements (in vitro) were in complete agreement with the phenotype-based classification (in vivo), for five of the six mutants. As expected, the class 3 mutants C354A and D692A are inactive, and the class 2 mutants M149A, E164A, and P355A partially active. The fact that C356A, a class 3 mutant, displayed a Cd2+-dependent ATPase activity is more puzzling and suggests that mutation of Cys356 uncouples ATP hydrolysis and Cd2+ transport. In addition, these results show that the two cysteines of the Cys-Pro-Cys motif have a distinct role in Cd2+ transport. The Phosphorylated Intermediates—CadA can be phosphorylated from ATP in the forward direction (Scheme 1, step 2) and from Pi in the backward direction (Scheme 1, step 4) (31Bal N. Mintz E. Guillain F. Catty P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Wu C.C. Gardarin A. Catty P. Guillain F. Mintz E. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2006.06.013Google Scholar). These two reactions depend on Cd2+. The presence of Cd2+ at the transport site of CadA (Scheme 1, CdnE) is required for the phosphorylation from ATP (Scheme 1, step 2), whereas Cd2+ binding at that site (Scheme 1, step 1) competes with the phosphorylation from Pi (Scheme 1, reverse of step 4). Hence, both phosphorylation reactions give access to an apparent affinity of the Cd2+-transport site. Phosphorylation from Pi—Membrane fractions from Sf9 cells expressing CadA are phosphorylated from Pi at equilibrium (Fig. 5A). In the absence of Cd2+, full phosphorylation is reached, hence the 100% value. Cd2+ inhibits CadA phosphorylation from Pi with an apparent affinity of 0.5 μm (Fig. 5A). It is commonly admitted for P-type ATPases that such an inhibition reflects the binding of the transported ion to the transport site (see Ref. 33Guimaraes-Motta H. de Meis L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 203: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar for SERCA1a). However, like most of the P1B-ATPases, CadA possesses an additional metal-binding domain in its cytoplasmic NH2-terminal end (34Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Su X.C. Miras R. Bal N. Mintz E. Catty P. Shokes J.E. Scott R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 638-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that was shown to regulate CadA activity (31Bal N. Mintz E. Guillain F. Catty P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To verify whether such a domain could participate in the inhibition of the phosphorylation from Pi, we performed similar experiments on two CadA mutants, one truncated from its NH2 terminus (ΔMBD), the other mutated at the two cysteines of the Cys-X-X-Cys motif (CadA-AA). Cd2+ inhibits CadA, ΔMBD, and CadA-AA phosphorylation from Pi at the same concentration, reflecting its binding to the transmembrane domain (Fig. 5B). When the same experiments were performed on the class 2 and class 3 mutants, the same phosphorylation level was measured in the absence of Cd2+ (Fig. 5A). The apparent affinity for Cd2+ is similar to that of CadA for M149A (0.5 μm) and P355A (0.7 μm), suggesting that Cd2+ binding is not altered in these two mutants. On the other hand, D692A (5.1 μm) and C354A (7.5 μm) displayed more than 10-fold decrease in their apparent affinity for Cd2+, suggesting an essential role of Cys354 and Asp692 in Cd2+ coordination, in agreement with the finding that these two mutants do not have any ATPase activity (Fig. 4). To a lesser extent, C356A (2 μm) and E164A (2.3 μm) also exhibited a reduced apparent affinity for Cd2+. Phosphorylation from ATP—In the presence of Cd2+, addition of ATP to membrane fractions from Sf9 cells expressing CadA triggers the enzymatic cycle (Scheme 1). The phosphoenzyme level, measured 15 s later, reflects the ratio between the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation rates of the cycle (Fig. 6A). The effect of Cd2+ on CadA phosphorylation from ATP displayed two phases. First, the phosphoenzyme increased from 0to20 μm Cd2+ and stabilized at a level corresponding to 25% of the maximum level reached by CadA, until 100 μm Cd2+ was reached. It should be emphasized that the apparent affinity for Cd2+ in this first phase (0.75 μm) is similar to that previously estimated from Pi phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). The second phase of the phosphorylation peaked at 1 mm Cd2+ (the phosphorylation level decreased at higher Cd2+ concentrations). Referring to Scheme 1, the second phase could reflect an inhibitory effect of Cd2+ on Cd2+ release (step 3), leading to the accumulation of CdnE∼P. Hence, the first phase results from Cd2+ binding to the cytoplasmic-facing site before ATP phosphorylation and the second from Cd2+ binding from the extracellular-facing site after ATP phosphorylation. As illustrated by “isotopic dilution” experiments where CadA labeling decreased upon [γ-32P]ATP dilution, CadA phosphoenzymes formed at low and high Cd2+ were transient (Fig. 6C). It should be mentioned here that the maximum level of phosphoenzyme reached by CadA in the presence of ATP (1 mm Cd2+) represented only 10% of the level reached in the presence of Pi (EGTA), the latter corresponding to the maximum amount of phosphorylatable enzyme. The low phosphorylation level with ATP primarily results from the low concentration of ATP used in these experiments (about 10-fold lower than the apparent affinity for ATP, data not shown) but also from the relative rate constants of the reaction cycle. Such a low phosphorylation level for the wild-type protein authorizes “over”-phosphorylation levels such as those shown below for the mutants C356A and E164A (Fig. 6B). As shown in Fig. 6A, C354A and D692A, two class 3 mutants characterized by a low apparent affinity for Cd2+ and no ATPase activity, do not produce any phosphorylated intermediates from ATP, a result that seems to contradict the inhibition of the phosphorylation from Pi by Cd2+ shown in Fig. 5A. Unlike C354A and D692A, C356A, the third class 3 mutant, is phosphorylatable from ATP (Fig. 6, A and B). However, the phosphorylation profile of C356A has two main differences from that of CadA, a shift of the first phase toward higher Cd2+ concentrations an"

Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The best studied CorA systems are from Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli. S. Typhimurium CorA encodes a membrane protein of 316 amino acid residues, with a unique topology (21Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It can be considered as a two-domain protein: a 235-amino acid residue N-terminal-soluble domain, which is located in the periplasmic space (periplasmic domain (PPD) 3The abbreviations used are: PPD, periplasmic domain; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TM, transmembrane domain; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; IQ, index quality.), followed by a transmembrane domain (TM) composed of three transmembrane segments (21Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent work by Daley and colleagues (23Daley D.O. Rapp M. Granseth E. Melen K. Drew D. von Heijne G. Science. 2005; 308: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) revealed that both the N and C termini of E. coli CorA are located at the cytosol side. From the small number of TM segments, it is reasonable to suggest that CorA would function as an oligomer. Recent studies suggested that CorA from Salmonella serovar Typhimurium, Methanococcus jannaschii, and Bacillus subtilis, expressed in the cells and purified in the PPD, all exist as homotetramers (24Warren M.A. Kucharski L.M. Veenstra A. Shi L. Grulich P.F. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Primary structural and functional studies indicate that CorA is unusual among secondary transporters. It expresses constitutively and transports Mg2+ with high capacity. The transporting kinetics of S. typhimurium CorA has been studied in detail (17Hmiel S.P. Snavely M.D. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1444-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4761-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It not only uptakes Mg2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ but also mediates Mg2+ efflux when extracellular magnesium concentration is higher than 1 mm (25Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4761-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that three conserved residues on the α-helices of TM2 and TM3 participate directly in the transporting process and may be involved in substrate binding and formation of a specific Mg2+-permeable pore (26Szegedy M.A. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36973-36979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Smith R.L. Szegedy M.A. Kucharski L.M. Walker C. Wiet R.M. Redpath A. Kaczmarek M.T.

Cobalt(III) hexa-amine, an analog of hydrated Mg2+, can inhibit CorA specifically, which implies that it is hydrated Mg2+ that binds to the N-terminal periplasmic domain in the first step of transporting Mg2+ (28Kucharski L.M. Lubbe W.J. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16767-16773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although CorA is the most widely studied magnesium transporter in bacteria, little is known about its structural and molecular roles of the large N-terminal PPD in Mg2+ transport. In the present study, we focused on the structure and function of PPD. Soluble PPD was purified and biochemically characterized. Size-exclusion chromatography showed that purified PPD exists as a tetramer. A combination of CD spectra and substrate-binding assay showed that CorA PPD retained the same substrate binding capacity as the full-length native protein. The structure observed by electron microscopy revealed the overall architecture of PPD tetramers in solution and on the lipid membrane. The pyramid-like homotetramer of CorA PPD with a central cavity may connect with the “magnesium pore,” thus forming a “tunnel” that mediates ion transport. Protein Expression and Purification—All E. coli cells were grown in Luria-Bertani broth, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmids and primers used in the present work are listed below (Table 1). PPD and C191A were expressed with an N-terminal GST fusion tag in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), which was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C for 6 h when A600 reached 0.6. Harvested cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4), containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 kilo-unit DNaseI, 1 mg/ml Lysozyme, then broken by ultrasonic homogenizer. The supernatant was obtained by centrifuged cell lysates at 34,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. PPD and C191A were obtained by GST affinity purification and on column thrombin digestion at 16 °C for 8 h, and then concentrated by ultrafiltration. GST-PPD was obtained by eluting the bound protein directly from glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) after extensive washing. Affinity-purified PPD and C191A were further loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and collected as 0.4 ml per tube by an auto collector. The peak eluted at ∼132 kDa was collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration for subsequent electron microscopy analysis, CD scan, and substrate binding assay.TABLE 1Plasmids and primers used in the current workNameVectorPrimers used in cloning or site mutagenesisReferenceCorAHpBAD-mycHisA5-CATGCCATGGGAAGCGCATTTCAACTGGAAAA-329Chen Y.

Song J. Sui S.F. Wang D.N. Prot. Expr. Purif. 2003; 32: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) using TBS containing 20%(v/v) glycerol, 0.1% DDM, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol as running buffer. Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—Two-dimensional crystals of GST-PPD on monolayers were obtained using the techniques described by Uzgiris et al. (30Uzgiris E.E. Kornberg R.D. Nature. 1983; 301: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and in our previous work (31Wang H.W. Sui S. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 134: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32Wang H.W. Sui S. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 127: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 100 μg/ml affinity purified GST-PPD in the buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) was incubated underneath the monolayer composed of E. coli total lipid extract for 24 h at 15 °C. After incubation, the lipid monolayers were picked up on hydrophobic carbon-coated electron microscopy grids and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min. To observe CorA PPD molecules in solution, 3 μl of PPD protein sample with a concentration of 20 μg/ml was directly dropped onto a carbon-coated, glow-charged electron microscopy grid for ∼1 min, and then negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min. The specimens were examined with a Phillips CM120 microscope operated at 100 kV. The low dose mode was used to take images using Kodak SO-163 films at 74,000× magnification. Films were developed in full-strength D19 for 12 min. Images were digitized on a Nikon Coolscan 9000ED scanner at a step size of 12.7 μm/pixel. The processing of GST-PPD two-dimensional crystals was performed using the ICE (33Hanein D. Matlack K.E. Jungnickel B. Plath K. Kalies K.U. Miller K.R. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and MRC Image Processing Package (34Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) as described, including Fourier transformation, indexing, lattice parameter refinement, lattice unbending, amplitude, and phase extraction. The symmetry of the crystal was calculated by the ALLSPACE program (35Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For reconstruction of CorA-PPD in solution, the EMAN package was used (36Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar) and images were processed following standard protocols. 9768 particles were selected and extracted by the BOXER program. The optical density histograms for the pixels in each image were scaled to the mean ± S.D. for all images. Particle images were low-pass-filtered to 1 nm and then centered and rotationally aligned against an average of all nonaligned images. A new reference was calculated using the aligned images, and iterations of alignment and averaging were repeated another four times. The aligned particles were classified into ∼80 groups using factor analysis with k-means grouping. The initial model was created by common lines approach and refined by projection matching with 4-fold symmetry imposed. After several cycles of refinement, the process was halted because the Fourier shell correlation with the previous model did not yield any substantial differences within the resolution cutoff. The final map was calculated from 8143 particles. The resolution was estimated by applying the 0.5 threshold to the Fourier shell correlation between two maps calculated from two halves of the data. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. PPD and C191A were diluted to 0.2 mg/ml with buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl and analyzed in a 1-mm path length and 200 μl of cells at 25 °C. The same procedure was applied to full-length CorA, which was diluted to 0.2 mg/ml with the same buffer containing additional 20%(v/v) glycerol and 0.1% DDM. Samples were scanned five times at a rate of 200 nm/min and averaged. All spectra were subtracted by their buffer spectra. Calculations of the fractional percentage of secondary structures were carried out using the computer programs Spectra-Manager (Jasco), CD-Deconvolution and Dicroprot. Substrate Binding Measured by Fluorescence Quenching— The dissociation constants of CorA and PPD to different substrates were measured by the ligand dose-dependent fluorescence quenching method. An excitation wavelength of 283 nm and an emission range of 295–425 nm were set on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence meter. The measurements were performed using protein samples diluted to 0.1 mg/ml with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0 (adding 20% glycerol and 0.1% DDM in dilution buffer for CorA) and titrated by stock ligands in a 0.7-ml quartz cuvette at 25 °C. Volume changes of titration were omitted because they were controlled within 2.5%, and the final concentrations of Mg2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ were 1 mm. Fluorescence intensities at the emission apexes were exported. The fluorescence quenching ΔF versus ligands concentration [S] was plotted. Kd(app) of CorA and PPD to Mg2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ were calculated by performing curve-fitting with the SigmaPlot9.0 program using a simple binding mode according to Equation 1,ΔF=(F0-F)=[ΔFmax][S]/(Kd(app)+[S])(Eq. 1) where F is the fluorescence intensity at emission peaks following titration of substrates to concentration [S], F0 is the fluorescence intensity of protein samples at the emission peak in the absence of ligands, and Kd(app) is the apparent dissociation constant of CorA or CorA-PPD to ligands. CorA-PPD Exists as Homotetramer—Based on topology studies of S. Typhimurium CorA, which has only an 8-amino acid residue difference compared with E. coli CorA, the CorA PPD was expressed by the encoding region from Met-1 to Ile-223 in E. coli. Previously, PPD from Salmonella serovar Typhimurium and Methanococcus jannaschii were purified and refolded from inclusion bodies produced in E. coli (24Warren M.A. Kucharski L.M. Veenstra A. Shi L. Grulich P.F. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We also found E. coli CorA PPD normally formed inclusion bodies when expressed alone or with a 6× histidine tag. In the present work, soluble PPDs were obtained by expressed with an N-terminal GST fusion tag and purified by performing GST affinity chromatography and on column digestion. Size-exclusion chromatography analysis of affinity-purified PPD detected three peaks: aggregated form (>>232 kDa, full exclusion), presumed homotetramer (≈132 kDa), and monomer (between 66 and 19.4 kDa), respectively (Fig. 1A). No dimer peak was detected. A site-directed mutant, C191A, with its Cys-191 (the only cysteine in E. coli PPD) to alanine mutation, was also purified. Size-exclusion chromatography showed that it could also form a homotetramer with the same chromatographic pattern as PPD (Fig. 1, A–C). Further comparison of the CD spectra from PPD and C191A indicated that no large differences in secondary structure existed (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that disulfide bonds do not participate in tetramer formation. Although some PPD dimers were detected by native PAGE and unreduced SDS-PAGE (data not shown), these dimers were perhaps misfolded rather than in a stable oligomeric state. The oligomeric structure of PPD was further confirmed by two-dimensional crystals formed on lipid monolayers. We tried several different PPD constructs and found they could form some ordered structure on lipid monolayers composed of native E. coli lipid whole extract. When GST-PPD was incubated with E. coli lipid monolayer for 24 h, a kind of square crystal formed (Fig. 2A). Electron micrographs of the best negatively stained two-dimensional crystal diffracted to 20 Å (Fig. 2B). The lattice parameters were determined to be a = b = 122 Å, γ = 90°. Symmetry analysis suggested strong p4 or p4212 symmetry (Table 2). The projection maps without any symmetry and with p4 symmetry imposed are shown in Fig. 2 (C and D). There were no significant differences between these two maps, indicating that CorA two-dimensional crystals have real p4 symmetry. The projection map in Fig. 2D shows one unit cell (the dashed square) containing eight high density domains around the 4-fold axis. Four inner high density domains are arranged to form a square structure with a central low density cavity. The dimension of the square is ∼7 × 7 nm. There are a total of five tetrameric rings shown in Fig. 2D, and each of them is marked by a solid square. The possible existence of a gliding axis (p4212) indicates that the four rings distributed around the central ring are in an upside-down orientation, and different staining effects from the two sides makes the internal tetramer different from the surrounding four. The GST might account for the bridge density connecting two adjacent subunits.TABLE 2Phase residuals (°) of a typical image calculated for 17 layer groups by AllspacePhase residue (no.) versusTarget residual based on statistics taking the Friedel weight into accountLayer groupother spots (90° random)theoretical (45° random)1p119.78214.2822p230.4aShould be considered.4115.28228.53bP12_b70.82937.2220.03aP12_a79.03128.7620.64bP121_b12.1bAcceptable.292.4220.04aP121_a10.4bAcceptable.3132.2620.65bC12_b70.82937.2220.05aC12_a79.03128.7620.66P22261.110116.08223.37bP2221b53.910137.38223.37aP2221a59.610138.88223.38P2212119.2bAcceptable.10115.48223.39C22261.110116.08223.310p416.3bAcceptable.10515.38223.111P42252.221915.68221.412P421213.0bAcceptable.21915.38221.413p340.94019.714P31235.210612.21620.415P32134.910510.41420.316p638.212115.28222.717P62234.625215.28221.2a Should be considered.b Acceptable. Open table in a new tab Electron microscopy single particle analysis could provide the overall architecture of CorA PPD in solution. The negatively stained PPD in solution showed intact particles without any preferred orientation, as shown by the angular distribution map (Fig. 3A). Some particles showed the square shape as that showed in two-dimensional density maps (Fig. 3B, first row). We obtained the three-dimensional structure of PPD from negative-stained protein particles in solution by single particle reconstruction. The common line method was used to get an initial model, and the projection match was performed to refine the model. The initial model showed a little distortion of the 4-fold symmetry. Because the GST-CorA two-dimensional crystal showed strong 4-fold symmetry, the C4 symmetry was enforced in the refinement steps. A stable three-dimensional model was obtained after eight iterations of alignment/classification/three-dimensional reconstruction cycles and included 8143 particles. Some class averages and corresponding reprojections, together with some raw particles, are shown in Fig. 3B. The high similarity between the averages and reprojections indicates the accuracy of the three-dimensional reconstruction. The resolution test performed on two independent data sets give a value of 2.8 nm for the Fourier shell correlation criterion (0.5). The overall architecture of the PPD shows a pyramid shape with a central cavity (Fig. 3C). The length of the top side is 3.5 nm, and the length of the bottom side is 7 nm. The height is 4.5 nm. Four bulges derived from four CorA-PPD subunits are arranged symmetrically around the central cavity. The projection of this structure along the 4-fold symmetry axis has similar dimensions (∼7 nm) and arrangement of high density domains as the projection map from the GST-PPD two-dimensional crystals, indicating they have the same oligomeric structure. All of these results reveal that the tetramer is the basic oligomeric state of PPD in vitro. CorA-PPD Has Similar Secondary Structure with Full-length CorA—To further evaluate the influence of TM truncation on the structure of PPD, CD spectra of full-length CorA and PPD were scanned and compared. Results showed that CD spectra of CorA and PPD were both characterized by two negative peaks at ∼209 and 220 nm, the typical features of α-helix (Fig. 4). Secondary structure prediction using CD spectra-based computer programs showed that, although a little different, both CorA and PPD consist of ∼30 ∼ 40% α-helix and 20% β-sheet. Differences between CD spectra of CorA and PPD may be partly due to the truncation of C-terminal membrane-spanning α-helix. PPD, in regard to its secondary structure, seemed to retain its native structure as in full-length CorA. Purified CorA-PPD Has Substrate Binding Activity—To ensure that the observed pyramid-like structure of PPD was its functional state, the binding capacities of CorA and PPD to their substrates Mg2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ were analyzed and compared by the ligand dose-dependent fluorescence quench method. Despite the fact that tryptophan contributes most to protein fluorescence, there are only 4 tryptophans but 22 phenylalanine and 8 tyrosine residues in the sequence, so protein intrinsic fluorescence excited at 283 nm was integrative contributions of tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. Generally, titration of substrates would lead to quenching of the PPD intrinsic fluorescence, and the quenching effect showed a ligand dose-dependent mode. The titration measurements were ended when the final ion concentrations reached 1 mm. CorA or PPD were saturated by over 100 μm Mg2+; thereafter, intrinsic fluorescence showed little decrease (Fig. 5, A and B). Co2+ and Ni2+ had optical absorbance, which would introduce a progressive inner-filter effect on PPD intrinsic fluorescence, and even a denaturing effect on the protein itself at higher concentrations. Thus the titration curves showed a typical hyperbolic shape at low ion concentration but a linear decrease when ion concentration was >200 μm. Moreover, Kd values were measured more precisely under “tight binding” conditions, which occurred when [S] is equal to or slightly higher than Kd and there is an equilibrium between bound and free proteins (37Walmsley A. Baldwin S.A. Membrane Transport: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press Inc., London2000: 167-192Google Scholar). Therefore, dissociation constants of CorA and PPD for Mg2+ and Co2+ were calculated in ligands concentration range at 1 ∼ 200, for Ni2+ at 1 ∼ 500 μm. Within this range, optical absorbance and the denaturing effect were relatively negligible as partly indicated by comparison of CD spectra (data not shown). All data were fitted with a one-site saturation mode due to lack of knowledge about the exact substrate binding site of PPD. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd(app)) of CorA for Mg2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ were 18, 30, and 201 μm, and the Kd of CorA-PPD for Mg2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ were 31, 24, and 106 μm, respectively (Table 3). These data are similar to the results of Snavely (25Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4761-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) determined in vivo: the K of CorA to Mg2+, Co2+ d, and Ni2+, are within the ranges of 20 ∼ 40, 20 ∼ 40, and 200 ∼ 400 μm, respectively. Besides, we also tested the fluorescence changes of CorA and PPD following titration of Ca2+ and Zn2+, and it showed little response, indicating that binding of Mg2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ to CorA or PPD were specific (Fig. 5, A and B). No remarkable differences in dissociation constants to their substrates were observed between CorA and PPD, indicating that pyramid structure of PPD we observed was a functional state.TABLE 3The apparent dissociation constant (Kd(app)) of CorA and CorA PPD to Mg2+, Ni2+, and Co2+Mg2+Ni2+Co2+μmCorA18.4 ± 4.6201 ± 64.929.8 ± 8.8CorA-PPD30.9 ± 2.6106.8 ± 39.923.6 ± 3.8 Open table in a new tab Over 90% of the E. coli CorA PPD expressed alone or with a His6 fusion tag in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) formed inclusion bodies, and purification of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium and M. jannaschii CorA PPD also had to follow an inclusion body-refolding strategy for the same reason (24Warren M.A. Kucharski L.M. Veenstra A. Shi L. Grulich P.F. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, when fused with an N-terminal GST tag, up to 70% of the GST-PPD fusion protein was soluble. After affinity purification and removal of the GST fusion tag by thrombin digestion, PPD was soluble and stable. It has been demonstrated that, when the GST tag is fused at the proper terminal with proper linker, it can facilitate the folding process in vivo, thereby enhancing the solubility and stability of the target protein (38Smyth D.R. Mrozkiewicz M.K. McGrath W.J. Listwan P. Kobe B. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). There is only one cysteine (Cys-191) in the whole CorA sequence. Warren (24Warren M.A. Kucharski L.M. Veenstra A. Shi L. Grulich P.F. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) suggested that detection of the dimer band on unreduced SDS-PAGE does not definitely prove the existence of disulfide bonds in the native CorA, for Cys-191 could form a disulfide bond with an introduced Cys-317 residue. A dimer band was also detected in affinity-purified PPD in the present work by native PAGE and unreduced SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Gel-filtration and CD spectra revealed that C191A, a Cys-191 to alanine mutant of PPD, could form homotetramer as well, indicating that Cys-191 is not essential for formation of PPD homotetramer. On the contrary, formation of disulfide bonds might be a sign that the protein is misfolded, which accelerates the aggregation process of PPD. This was demonstrated partly by the facts that the C191A mutant was stabilized in TBS without β-mercaptoethanol, whereas PPD aggregated rapidly when β-mercaptoethanol was absent from the buffer (data not shown). Hence, PPD homotetramer perhaps consists of four independent monomers. Although purified CorA PPD has a stable structure, whether PPD could retain its native functional structure after truncation of the C-terminal membrane-spanning α-helix remains unknown. In this case, we used CD spectra to compare the structures of CorA-PPD and full-length CorA. CD spectrometry is a convenient way to evaluate the secondary structure of a protein. Secondary structure contents calculated by various computer programs showed that both CorA and PPD are comprised of ∼30 ∼ 40% α-helix and 20% β-sheet. The α-helix content in PPD was a little lower than CorA due to truncation of the transmembrane α-helix. Furthermore, we scanned CorA and PPD over a buffer pH range from 5.0 to 9.0, and no obvious differences were detected except at pH 5.0, where both CorA and PPD seemed to lose their secondary structure completely (data not shown). The similarity of the CD spectra change again suggested that PPD could perhaps retain its secondary structure when expressed without TM. Besides structural comparison of CorA-PPD and full-length CorA, we also compared the substrate binding of both proteins. The dissociation constant is a sound parameter for direct estimation of their binding capacity for substrates. The Kd(app) of CorA determined by the ligand dose-dependent fluorescence quench method in the present study were similar to the Kd values measured in vivo by Snavely (25Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4761-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The Kd(app) of PPD to its substrate exhibited no difference compared with CorA, indicating that the purified PPD homotetramer could retain its primary function of substrates binding as CorA. The pyramid-like structure of PPD revealed by single particle analysis also suggested that PPD was a homotetramer, consistent with our results from size-exclusion chromatography and Warren's previous report on cross-linking (24Warren M.A. Kucharski L.M. Veenstra A. Shi L. Grulich P.F. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of CorA and PPD showed that the observed pyramid-like structure of PPD is its functional and native state, and homotetramer is its functional state. Although the current structure has low resolution, it can still provide some indication of PPD functions. Previous site-directed mutagenesis analyses (26Szegedy M.A. Maguire M.E. J. Biol.

The pyramid-like PPD has a wide opening toward the periplasmic space and a narrow neck toward the membrane. The wide opening may facilitate binding of the relatively large hydrated magnesium ion, because it was suggested that magnesium in the hydrated form binds to CorA in the first step of magnesium transport (28Kucharski L.M. Lubbe W.J. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16767-16773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After binding hydrated magnesium, dehydration must occur before the bare magnesium ion can go through the narrow neck of PPD and enter into the magnesium pore formed by transmembrane segments. Some residues in the narrow neck of PPD may participate in the dehydration process and function as molecular filters for selection of the ions. A high resolution structure of CorA PPD is needed to understand how PPD binds, dehydrates, and selects divalent ions. Sequence alignment showed that Thermotoga maritima CorA and E. coli CorA share ∼18% of identity and >28% similarity. When this report was nearly completed, we noticed that T. maritima CorA had been crystallized by two independent groups with different crystallization conditions. One, which had been deposited in the PDB data base (PDB code 2BBJ) at 3.85-Å resolution, showed a pentamer structure of T. maritima CorA (39Lunin V.V. Dobrovetsky E. Khutoreskaya G. Zhang R.

F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; F62: 148-152Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Besides, the 3.85-Å crystal structure also demonstrated that T. maritima CorA has only two transmembrane segments. Topological studies by Daley et al. (23Daley D.O. Rapp M. Granseth E. Melen K. Drew D. von Heijne G. Science. 2005; 308: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) suggested that E. coli CorA has only two transmembrane segments with its large soluble domain at the cytosol side, which means that the E. coli CorA has an identical topology to that of T. maritima CorA, rather than that suggested by Smith et al. (21Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we re-evaluated the topological structure of E. coli CorA by labeling and detecting 6× histidine fusion tags added to the N and C termini of E. coli CorA in intact and 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100-permeated spheroplasts. The functional assays revealed that CorA with N- or C-terminal 6× histidine tags retained partial transporting activity. We obtained the same results (see data in supplemental materials) as those reported by Smith et al. (21Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting that the N-terminal large soluble domain of E. coli CorA was at periplasmic space. Hence, E. coli and T. maritima CorA may represent different CorA subfamilies of different topology and oligomeric state.

Recently, we demonstrated that the proto-oncogene TCL1, overexpressed in human T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, is an Akt kinase co-activator. Tightly restricted TCL1 gene expression in early developmental cells suggested that the TCL1 gene is regulated at a transcriptional level. To characterize how TCL1 gene expression is regulated, we cloned the 5′-promoter of the TCL1 gene located at human chromosome 14q32. The 5′-TCL1 promoter region contains a TATA box with cis-regulatory elements for Nur77/NGFI-B (nerve growth factor-responsive element (NBRE), CCAAGGTCA), NFκB, and fork head transcription factor. Nur77/NGFI-B, an orphan receptor superfamily transcription factor implicated in T-cell apoptosis, is a substrate for Akt. We hypothesized that TCL1 transactivity is regulated through Akt-induced phosphorylation of Nur77/NGFI-B in vivo. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with chromosomal immunoprecipitation assays, wild-type Nur77, but not S350A mutant Nur77, could specifically bind to TCL1-NBRE. A luciferase assay demonstrated that TCL1-NBRE is required for inhibition of TCL1 transactivity upon nerve growth factor/platelet-derived growth factor stimulation, which activates Akt and phosphorylates Nur77. Using a chromosomal immunoprecipitation assay with reverse transcription-PCR, nerve growth factor stimulation inhibited binding of endogenous Nur77 to TCL1-NBRE, in turn, suppressing TCL1 gene expression. The results together establish that TCL1-NBRE is a novel negative regulatory element of Nur77 (NGFI-B). To the best of our knowledge, TCL1-NBRE is the first direct target of Nur77 involving the regulation of intracellular cell death survival.

In T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, both TCL1 and TCL1b genes on human chromosome 14q23.1 are activated by translocations and inversions at 14q32.1, juxtaposing them to regulatory elements of T-cell receptor genes.

Three major isoforms of the human TCL1 oncogene are present in both the human and mouse genome, namely TCL1, TCL1b, and MTCP1 (9Lock R.B. Int. J. Biochem.

Under physiological conditions, TCL1 and TCL1b are highly expressed at early developmental stages in several fetal tissues, including thymus, kidney, lung (TCL1), and spleen (TCL1b). After birth, expression of all TCL1 family members is mainly restricted to lymphoid tissues, although TCL1b mRNA is also found in the placenta. It is notable that in mice both TCL1b and TCL1 mRNAs are abundant in oocytes and two-cell embryos, but rare in various adult tissues and lymphoid cell lines (14Virgilio L. Narducci M.G. Isobe M.

To clarify molecular regulation of TCL1 gene expression, we cloned 1123 bp of the 5′-promoter sequence of TCL1 (including 931 from base pairs of the 5′-TCL1 promoter region) from human chromosome 14q32. Nucleotide sequence analysis of TCL1 promoter region revealed that a Nur77 (NGFI-B) binding site (nerve growth factor response element (NBRE), CCAAGGTCA (30Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar)) is located within the proximal promoter. Nur77 (NGFI-B, nerve growth factor-induced B or TR3) was originally identified as a NGF-induced ligand-dependent transcriptional activator from PC12 cells (rat pheochromocytoma cells) (20Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Unlike other orphan receptor superfamily transcription factors, it is believed that ligands were not required for transactivation through Nur77/NGFI-B (21Winoto A. Littman D.R. Cell. 2002; 109: S57-S66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Additional subfamilies of NGFI-B transcription factor have been identified from neuronal cells as Nurr1 (Nur-related factor 1), and neuron-derived orphan receptor 1 (22Law S.W. Conneely O.M. DeMayo F.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 23Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Bandoh S. Sasaki K. Ohkura N. Yamaguchi K.

Oncol. 1998; 12: 1237-1243PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that Nur77 plays a pivotal role in T-cell apoptosis in vivo (25Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 26Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Recent studies have further demonstrated that Akt interacts with Nur77 and hence induces phosphorylation of Nur77 (27Matsuyama N. Onishi K. Mori Y. Ueno T. Takayama Y. Gotoh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 274: 32799-32805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Pekarsky Y. Hallas C. Palamarchuk A. Koval A. Bullrich F. Hirata Y. Bichi R. Letofsky J. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3690-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Despite intensive studies, a direct gene target of Nur77, which regulates the cell death survival machinery, is yet to be determined (21Winoto A. Littman D.R. Cell. 2002; 109: S57-S66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is noteworthy that the cis-regulatory element of Nur77 (NBRE) is well conserved within the TCL1 5′-proximal promoter region of human, mouse, and Rattus (21Winoto A. Littman D.R. Cell. 2002; 109: S57-S66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These observations lead us to hypothesize that the TCL1 gene can be regulated through NBRE by Akt-induced phosphorylation of Nur77/NGFI-B in vivo. By EMSA and luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated that Nur77 (NGFI-B family) bound to the NBRE site of the TCL1 promoter (TCL1-NBRE, AAGGTCA), and negatively regulated TCL1 gene expression by Akt stimulation. In PC12 cells, NGF stimulation induced endogenous Nur77 phosphorylation, diminished binding of Nur77 with the TCL1-NBRE, and, in turn, suppressed TCL1 transactivation. The results together demonstrated that TCL1-NBRE is a novel functional target of Nur77 (NGFI), which could play an important role for the restricted expression of the TCL1 gene in vivo. Cloning and Construction of 5′-TCL1 Promoter Reporter Constructs—Using the following primers for PCR (forward primer: 5′-ATCATCGAGCTCCAGGCTGGAGCTGGTTTCCATG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-ATCATCAGATCTCGTCCAAATACACGAAC TTCTCCC-3′), we amplified 1123 bp (–931 to +192 of TCL1 proximal promoter region) from human 293 kidney fibroblasts (ATCC). The resultant TCL1 promoter fragment was cloned into SacI and BglII sites of luciferase reporter construct PGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI), and designated as pGL3-TCL1. NBRE mutant was generated by digesting with BstEII (within the binding sequence of NBRE of TCL1 promoter), treated with mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs), and ligated back into PGL3 (PGL3-mt-NBRE or pGL3-mt-NBRE-470). The resultant nucleotide sequences were mutated from AAGGTCA to AAGCCC at the TCL1-NBRE site. Mutation of cis-regulatory element of FKHRL (pGL3-mt-FKHRL) was introduced by QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis using pairs of primers (forward primer: 5′-GTTACTGCAAAGCGAAGTGAAATTG-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-CAAT TTCACTTCGCTTTGCAGTAAC-3′). Truncation mutant of TCL1 promoter (PGL3-TCL1-470) was generated by amplifying by the pairs of primers (forward primer: 5′-CGGGGTACCTGATCCCATAAGATGAGAG-3′, reverse primer: 5′-ATCATCAGATCTCGTCCAAATACACGAACTTCTCCC-3′). The resultant truncated promoter fragment (from –470 to +192) was digested with KpnI and BglII and subcloned into PGL3 Luciferase reporter construct (pGL3-TCL1-470). The nucleotide sequences of all the luciferase reporter constructs were confirmed by using the Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) using an ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequence analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Luciferase Reporter Assays—PC12 cells (rat pheochromocytoma cells, ATCC) or 293T cells (human kidney fibroblasts, ATCC) were cultured in the charcoal-treated 10% FBS in 24-well plates (Corning). One microgram of indicated luciferase reporter constructs was transfected (wild-type or mutant forms of TCL1 promoter as indicated) by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were serum-starved and for additional 12 h, stimulated with NGF (50 ng/ml, murine NGF (7S), 13290-010, Invitrogen) or PDGF (100 ng/ml, PDGF-AB, p3326, Sigma) as indicated. Luciferase reporter assays were performed using Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 20 μm wortmannin (Calbiochem, KY-12420) or 20 μm PD98059 (Biomol, EI-360) or Me2SO for 30 min at 37 °C as indicated. Cells were then stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF for 15 min, and luciferase reporter activities were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Generation of Recombinant Nur77—A GST-Nur77-DBD (DNA-binding domain) fusion construct in pGEX-4T (pGEX-4T-Nur77-DBD) was generated by PCR amplification using pairs of primers (forward primer: 5′-CGGGATCCGCACCCGTAACCTCCAC-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-CGGAATTCTCAGGGTTTTGAAGGTAGC-3′) with wild-type Nur77 cDNA as a template and subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The resultant pGEX-4T-Nur77-DBD expression vector was transformed into BL21 cells (DE3, Invitrogen) and the GST-Nur77-DBD recombinant protein was harvested, dialyzed in a dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). The protein concentrations were determined by Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). Electric Mobility Band Shift Assays—EMSA (Fig. 2A) was performed as described in a previous study (29Noguchi M. Miyamoto S.

Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and cultured on a 100-mm dish (CellBIND Surface). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for an additional 16 h and stimulated (or non-stimulated) with PDGF (50 ng/ml, PDGF-AB, p3326, Sigma) for 20 min as indicated. The cells were then harvested and lysed with Hepes cell lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) by the freeze-thaw method. Thirty micrograms of cell lysates were incubated with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 90 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin in the presence of 30 pmol of fluorescein-labeled TCL1-NBRE probes for 30 min at 4 °C. The resultant samples were resolved onto 4.5% acrylamide-0.5× TBE gels, and DNA-protein complexes were visualized by Bio-Rad Imaging system (Bio-Rad VersaDoc 5000). GST antibody (0–5 μg, Clontech) was used for the supershift experiment (Fig. 2E). Eighty pmol of recombinant GST-Nur77-DBD protein were used for the cold competition experiments (Fig. 2D) combined with a 500- to 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled TCL1-NBRE probes as indicated. Thirty micrograms of PC12 cell-derived cell extract, with 3 μg of anti-Nur77 antibody (M-210, sc5569, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-NOR1 (C-19, sc-22519, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Nurr1 (E-20, sc-990, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit normal serum as a control, was used for supershift experiment (Fig. 4B). In Vitro ChIP Assay—293 cells (human kidney fibroblast cell line, ATCC) were transiently transfected with 5 μg of luciferase reporter constructs (pGL3-TCL1 or pGL3-mt-NBRE) with Nur77 (pCS-myc-Nur77-WT or pCS-myc-Nur77-S350A (28Pekarsky Y.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and treated with 0.125 m glycine to terminate the fixation reaction. Cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μm Leupeptin) at 4 °C for 20 min, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The resultant cellular extracts were lysed using nuclear lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS), immunoprecipitated with protein-agarose-conjugated anti-Myc antibody (9E10, sc-40, Santa Cruz, Biotechnology) for 16 h at 4 °C. The resultant immune complexes were extracted and used for subsequent PCR reaction with pairs of primers (forward primer: 5′-TCCTGGTGTCGACTGTGAGT-3′, reverse primer: 5′-AGCTCCTGGGAACGCAGAC-3′) to detect fragment of TCL1-NBRE fragment by resolving onto 1.0% TAE (Tris acetate-EDTA) agarose gel. Equal amounts of NBRE expression were verified by PCR using the same sets of primers using 5 μlof cellular extracts as a template from the transfected cells and visualized on 1.0% agarose gel. In Vivo Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—In vivo ChIP assays were performed essentially using a QuikChip kit (IMGENEX) with minor modification using 3 μg of anti-Nur77 antibody (M-210, sc5569, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-NOR1 (C-19, sc-22519, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Nurr1 (E-20, sc-990, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit normal serum as a control. PC12 cells (rat pheochromocytoma cells, ATCC) were cultured on a 100-mm dish (CellBIND Surface) with charcoal-treated 10% FBS and 5% horse serum. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h before NGF stimulation (50 ng/ml, murine NGF (7S), 13290-010, Invitrogen) for an additional 6 h and harvested for the subsequent PCR reaction. The 250-bp genomic TCL1 promoter DNA fragments were detected by two-step PCR using the following primer sets (first primer set, 5′-TGACCTCATGGTAAACATAGC-3′ and 5′-ACATATAGCGAGCGCATCAG-3′; second primer set, 5′-ACCTCATGGTAAACATAGCG-3′ and 5′-GTCTATACACACTGCATATGC-3′). The resultant PCR products were loaded onto 1.5% TBE-agarose gel, and the DNA fragments were visualized. RT-PCR—PC12 cells (ATCC) were cultured on a 100-mm dish (CellBIND Surface) with charcoal-treated 10% FBS and 5% horse serum. The cells were serum-starved for 16 h, then stimulated with NGF (50 ng/ml, murine NGF (7S), 13290-010, Invitrogen) for indicated time periods. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). mRNA was isolated using Oligotex-dT30 (Takara) for generating the first strand cDNA using a First-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Takara). RT-PCR was performed using pairs of primers (TCL1, 5′-TGGGTTCACTGTGAGGGTGTC-3′ and 5′-GTAGAGCTGCCACATGAGAGG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-AAGTATGATGACATCAAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-AGTTACAGGAGACAACCTGG-3′) with EX Taq polymerase (Takara) using a thermal cycler (iCycler, Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting—293 cells (Fig. 2, A and B) were cultured in a 100-mm dish (CellBIND Surface) in charcoal-treated FBS and transfected with 7.5 μg of expression vectors (or sham-transfected) using the calcium phosphate method. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for an additional 16 h, then stimulated with (or without) PDGF (50 ng/ml, PDGF-AB, p3326, Sigma) as indicated for 8 min, and lysed with Brij 97 buffer in the presence of 1 mm Na3VO4 and 10 mm NaF (4Laine J. Künstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of cell lysate was loaded onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE (Daiichikagaku) and immunoblotted by the indicated antibodies (anti-Akt, 9272, anti-phospho-Ser-473 Akt, 9271, Cell Signaling; anti-c-Myc, 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (Fig. 2A), or anti-FLAG M2, Sigma) using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). To detect phosphorylated Nur77 (Fig. 2B), cell lysates were precleaned, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) using a ProA/ProG mixture (4Laine J. Künstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and immunoblotted with anti-phospho antibody (#9601, Cell Signaling). To detect non-phosphorylated (or phosphorylated) Akt and Nur77 (Figs. 4 and 5), PC12 cells were harvested at indicated time points after NGF stimulation (50 ng/ml, murine NGF (7S), 13290-010, Invitrogen), lysed with Brij97 lysis buffer (4Laine J. Künstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), resolved onto SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted by TCL1 polyclonal antibody (533, generated by recombinant human TCL1), anti-Akt Abs, or anti-phospho-Ser-473 Akt Abs using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). To detect phosphorylated Nur77, cells were harvested, lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-Nur77 antibody (M-210, sc5569, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and immunoblotted by anti-phospho antibody (9601, Cell Signaling). Structure of the TCL1 Promoter Region—To clarify the molecular regulation of TCL1, we cloned 1123 bp of the TCL1 5′-proximal promoter (from –931 to +192) from human 293 cells (ATCC). Sequence analysis of the 5′-TCL1 promoter region revealed a TATA box with the following transcriptional regulatory elements of FKHRL: Nur77, MyoD, IRF, NFκB, or Sp1 (Fig. 1A). Recently, it was reported that Akt activation directly phosphorylates and regulates Nur77 (NGFI-B or TR3) and fork head transcription factor (FKHRL) (27Matsuyama N. Onishi K. Mori Y. Ueno T.

In this regard it was striking that a putative FKHRL consensus binding site (CAAAATAA, located from –857 to 850) as well as a Nur77/NGFI-B binding site (NBRE, CCAAGGTCA, located from –340 to –332) were present within 1000 of the 5′-TCL1 proximal promoter region (Fig. 1B). Nur77 is an orphan receptor superfamily transcription factor that is implicated in neuronal development and apoptosis (20Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that none of the molecular targets of Nur77/NGFI-B in cell death and survival machinery have been identified in the literature (21Winoto A. Littman D.R.

These vertebrate nucleotidases may play a role in protein glycosylation. The activity of this enzyme family is strictly dependent on calcium, which induces a conformational change in the secreted, soluble human nucleotidase. The crystal structure of this human enzyme was recently solved; however, the mechanism of calcium activation and the basis for the calcium-induced changes remain unclear. In this study, using analytical ultracentrifugation and chemical cross-linking, we show that calcium or strontium induce noncovalent dimerization of the soluble human enzyme. The location and nature of the dimer interface was elucidated using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and chemical cross-linking, coupled with crystallographic analyses. Replacement of Ile170, Ser172, and Ser226 with cysteine residues resulted in calcium-dependent, sulfhydryl-specific intermolecular cross-linking, which was not observed after cysteine introduction at other surface locations. Analysis of a super-active mutant, E130Y, revealed that this mutant dimerized more readily than the wild-type enzyme. The crystal structure of the E130Y mutant revealed that the mutated residue is found in the dimer interface. In addition, expression of the full-length nucleotidase revealed that this membrane-bound form can also dimerize and that these dimers are stabilized by spontaneous oxidative cross-linking of Cys30, located between the single transmembrane helix and the start of the soluble sequence. Thus, calcium-mediated dimerization may also represent a mechanism for regulation of the activity of this nucleotidase in the physiological setting of the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi.

It was recently discovered that mammals, including rats (1Failer B.U. Braun N. Zimmermann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36978-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and humans (2Smith T.M. Hicks-Berger C.A. Kim S. Kirley T.L. Arch. Biochem.

Galperin M.Y. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30583-30590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), mosquitoes (4Champagne D.E. Smartt C.T. Ribeiro J.M. James A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and ticks (5Mans B.J. Gaspar A.R. Louw A.I. Neitz A.W. Exp. Appl. Acarol. 1998; 22: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mammalian enzymes exist as both membrane-bound forms in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (1Failer B.U. Braun N. Zimmermann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36978-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), as well as secreted, soluble forms (2Smith T.M. Hicks-Berger C.A. Kim S. Kirley T.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 406: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The physiological functions of these vertebrate nucleotidases are not yet well established, although they may play a role in protein glycosylation (1Failer B.U. Braun N. Zimmermann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36978-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In insect saliva, these soluble proteins are part of the anti-coagulation mixture injected at the site of skin puncture to keep the blood of the host from clotting, so that the insect can continue to feed. However, unlike the insect members of this family, the mammalian enzymes hydrolyze ADP very poorly (1Failer B.U. Braun N. Zimmermann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36978-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2Smith T.M. Hicks-Berger C.A. Kim S. Kirley T.L. Arch. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), making control of platelet activation and subsequent blood coagulation an unlikely function for the mammalian enzymes, because ADP is a critical agonist for platelet activation. However, Dai et al. (7Dai J. Liu J. Deng Y. Smith T.M. Lu M. Cell. 2004; 116: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were able to engineer the soluble human enzyme to hydrolyze ADP efficiently, by combining five point mutations based on their analysis of the crystal structure. Because of its substrate preference and subcellular localization, Failer et al. (1Failer B.U. Braun N. Zimmermann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36978-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) postulated that the membrane-bound rat enzyme may function to support glycosylation reactions related to protein biosynthetic quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum.These mammalian enzymes are termed calcium activated nucleotidases (CAN), 3The abbreviations used are: CAN, calcium activated nucleotidase (Gen-Bank™ accession number AF328554); SCAN, soluble calcium activated nucleotidase; DTT, dithiothreitol; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; BMH, bis-maleimidohexane; BMOE, bis-maleimidoethane; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino] propanesulfonic acid.3The abbreviations used are: CAN, calcium activated nucleotidase (Gen-Bank™ accession number AF328554); SCAN, soluble calcium activated nucleotidase; DTT, dithiothreitol; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; BMH, bis-maleimidohexane; BMOE, bis-maleimidoethane; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino] propanesulfonic acid. as described in a recent review (8Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Purinergic Signal. 2006; 2: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mammalian CAN enzymes were discovered less than 5 years ago, and there have been only a few publications characterizing these enzymes (1Failer B.U. Braun N. Zimmermann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36978-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2Smith T.M. Hicks-Berger C.A. Kim S. Kirley T.L. Arch. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9185-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the progress on the structure of the soluble form of this nucleotidase (SCAN) was rapid, culminating in the report of the crystal structure of the human enzyme in 2004 (7Dai J. Liu J. Deng Y. Smith T.M. Lu M. Cell. 2004; 116: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, some questions remain, and alternative interpretations of the crystal structure have been presented (9Yang M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9185-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), based on the lack of calcium ions during crystallization (7Dai J. Liu J. Deng Y. Smith T.M. Lu M. Cell. 2004; 116: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), because it was previously demonstrated that human SCAN is calcium-activated and undergoes a calcium-induced conformational change (6Murphy D.M. Ivanenkov V.V. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).There have been no published reports of CAN dimerization. In fact, the size of human SCAN, determined by size exclusion chromatography, was reported to be consistent with a monomer in two previously published works from this laboratory (2Smith T.M. Hicks-Berger C.A. Kim S. Kirley T.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 406: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Murphy D.M. Ivanenkov V.V. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, sedimentation equilibrium experiments conducted with 2 mm CaCl2 in a buffer that also contained 150 mm NaCl indicated that SCAN was monomeric under these conditions (7Dai J. Liu J. Deng Y. Smith T.M. Lu M. Cell. 2004; 116: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, it was unexpected when the first data suggesting that this protein forms a dimer in solution were obtained.In this study, we characterized the dimerization of human SCAN by size exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, chemical cross-linking, site-directed mutagenesis, and x-ray crystallography. It was observed that under appropriate solution conditions, this nucleotidase forms dimers in the presence of calcium and strontium, but not in the presence of magnesium ions. Dimers are also observed in the membrane-bound, full-length form of human CAN expressed in mammalian COS cells. In COS cells, these dimers are partially disulfide-linked in the wild-type enzyme, mediated by a cysteine close to the N terminus that is not present in the soluble form of the enzyme.The reason for the observed increased nucleotidase activities of a previously published mutation of SCAN (E130Y) (9Yang M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9185-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was not clear, given that this residue is far removed from the active site as identified by the crystal structure of the human enzyme co-crystallized with a nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogue (7Dai J. Liu J. Deng Y. Smith T.M. Lu M. Cell. 2004; 116: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, a likely mechanism is suggested by the location of this residue in the dimer interface identified in the current study by cysteine replacement mutations combined with sulfhydryl-specific cross-linking, as well as crystallographic analyses.The identified dimer interface has a more extensive buried surface area and better shape complementarity than other protein-protein interfaces observed in the crystal structure. Human SCAN has a five-bladed β-propeller fold (7Dai J. Liu J. Deng Y. Smith T.M. Lu M. Cell. 2004; 116: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the interface of the dimer is localized primarily within the 2d and 3d elements of the β-propeller and that the dimer interface is dominated by hydrophobic interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and Escherichia coli competent bacteria were purchased from Stratagene. The DNA Core Facility at the University of Cincinnati produced the synthetic oligonucleotides and sequenced all cDNA constructs. Plasmid purification kits and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agars were purchased from Qiagen. The bacterial expression vector pET28a and the bacterial expression BL21(DE3) cells were purchased from Novagen. Glycerol and dialysis tubing were from Fisher. The chemical cross-linkers DSS, glutaraldehyde, BMH, and BMOE were purchased from Pierce, as were B-PER bacterial extraction reagent and the enhanced chemiluminescent reagents used for Western blots. The pre-cast SDS-PAGE 4-15% gradient mini-gels were obtained from Bio-Rad. Ampicillin, kanamycin, nucleotides, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, glucose, DTT, and other reagents were from Sigma. Sephacryl S-100 used for size exclusion chromatography was obtained from Amersham Biosciences.Site-directed Mutagenesis—A series of mutants of human SCAN have been designed and made to introduce cysteine residues at various surface locations, thus allowing analysis of the ability of these mutant proteins to be intermolecularly cross-linked into dimers. There is only one native cysteine (Cys257) in the sequence of human SCAN, and to simplify the interpretation of experiments, this residue (Cys257) was mutated to serine (C257S), to serve as the starting point for the cysteine substitution mutants. This “cysteine-less” C257S mutant has wild type-like activity and characteristics. Thus, most of the following mutations were made in this C257S background using the primers listed, with the substitution sites in bold type and underlined: C257S, 5′-CCATGAGTCTGCC-AGCTGGAGTGACACGC-3′; S109C, 5′-CTGACCCTGTCAGACTGTGGGGACAAGGTG-3′; I170C, 5′-CAAAGCCGTGCCCTGGGTGTGTCTGTCCGACGGCGACGG-3′; S172C, 5′-CTGGGTGATTCTGTGCGACGGCGACGGCAC-3′; S226C, 5′-GTGGTGGGCTACAAGGGCTGTGTGGACCACGAGAACTGG-3′; S278C, 5′-CCAGGAGCGCTACTGCGAGAAGGACGACG-3′; A287C, 5′-GAGCGCAAGGGCTGCAACCTGCTGCTGAG-3′; and E130Y, 5′-GTCCCACCTGGCGTATAAGGGGAGAGGCATG-3′ (mutated in wild-type background). The complementary antisense oligonucleotides also necessary for the mutagenesis are not shown. The mutagenesis methodology was described previously (10Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and used the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as described (11Smith T.M. Lewis Carl S.A. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5849-5857Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The presence of the correct mutation and lack of unwanted mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.Expression, Refolding, and Purification of SCAN Mutants in E. coli BL21(DE3) Bacterial Cells—The wild-type and mutant SCAN cDNA constructs were used to transform bacterial expression host BL21(DE3) cells (6Murphy D.M. Ivanenkov V.V. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and after induction of expression with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, bacterial inclusion bodies containing the SCAN proteins were isolated, and the protein was refolded and purified as described previously (6Murphy D.M. Ivanenkov V.V. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Ivanenkov V.V. Murphy-Piedmonte D.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11726-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The only modification was that DTT was added during some stages of the purification of the refolded cysteine mutant proteins to avoid cysteine oxidation. Thus, after eluting from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads that bind the N-terminal His6 tag, the proteins were processed in buffer which includes 0.2 mm DTT. Even so, mutations that tend to efficiently oxidize spontaneously, such as S226C, still formed some intermolecular dimers during purification. DTT was also added to a final concentration of 0.2-0.3 mm after protein elution from the anion exchange cartridge. Prior to cross-linking experiments, residual DTT was eliminated or minimized by dialysis or by dilution and subsequent protein concentration using Amicon 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off concentrators. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad G-250 dye binding technique according to the modifications of Stoscheck (13Stoscheck C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or using calculated molar extinction coefficients for the 37,764-Da wild-type SCAN protein of 81,360 cm-1 m-1 at 280 nm and 82,850 cm-1 m-1 for the E130Y mutant, estimated by the ProtParam tool on the ExPASy server (us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html).Nucleotidase Assays—Nucleotidase activities were determined by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) released from nucleotide substrates in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ at 37 °C using a modification of the technique of Fiske and Subbarow (14Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), as described previously (15Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The enzyme assays were initiated by the addition of a final concentration of 2.5 mm nucleotide, except for the experiments measuring the dependence of activity on SCAN protein concentration (see Fig. 7), where a final concentration of 4 mm ADP was used. The units used for enzyme activity are μmol of Pi generated per mg of protein/h. Prior to assay, CAN protein was diluted into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 0.1% Tween 20 to avoid adsorption to surfaces previously noted to occur when handling very dilute solutions of SCAN.Size Exclusion Chromatography—Human wild-type SCAN protein was analyzed on a 28-cm-long, 11.5-ml bed volume Sephacryl S-100 column equilibrated in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, with or without 2 mm CaCl2, at a flow rate of 0.28 ml/min. 200-μl aliquots of various concentrations of SCAN protein in the column buffer were applied to the column, and the elution positions of the 280-nm peaks were noted.Chemical Cross-linking with Glutaraldehyde or DSS, a Hydrophobic, Lysine-specific Cross-linker—Cross-linking stock solutions were always freshly prepared (in dry Me2SO for DSS, in water for glutaraldehyde). Purified SCAN proteins (0.1 mg/ml) were incubated in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of 5 mm CaCl2, for 10 min at 22 °C in the presence or absence of DSS (250 μm) or glutaraldehyde (500 μm). Cross-linking was stopped by adding an excess (10 mm) of lysine and incubating for 5 min at room temperature. Finally, nonreducing sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min, run on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed either by Coomassie staining of the gel or by Western blot. When analyzed by Western blot, an affinity-purified anti-CAN anti-peptide antibody raised against the C-terminal sequence was used, and the bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence, as described previously (2Smith T.M. Hicks-Berger C.A. Kim S. Kirley T.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 406: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Analysis of Cysteine Substitution Mutants by Cross-linking Using the Hydrophobic, Sulfhydryl-specific Reagents BMH and BMOE—Stocks of 20 mm BMH and BMOE were made in dry Me2SO and stored at-80 °C. The final concentrations of these reagents used for cross-linking were varied from 6 to 50 μm. The cross-linking reactions were carried out in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, at 22 °C, at a final protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, both in the presence and absence of 5 mm CaCl2. BMH or BMOE (or Me2SO used as a vehicle control) was added and incubated for 10 min at 22 °C. The cross-linking reactions were stopped by adding an excess of cysteine and incubating for 5 min prior to adding nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After heating the samples for 10 min at 60 °C, SDS-PAGE was performed as described above.Calcium-induced Change in the Tryptophan Fluorescence of SCAN as a Function of Protein Concentration—The increase in tryptophan fluorescence (excitation at 295 nm, emission at 340 nm) was measured after a single addition of CaCl2 to a final Ca2+ concentration of 2 mm in 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.4 (6Murphy D.M. Ivanenkov V.V. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was varied from a low near the sensitivity limit of the instrument, to a high at approximately the concentration where inner filter effects and other nonideal fluorescence effects are observed. To allow comparison with previous studies and to the current analytical ultracentrifugal studies, the experiments were performed in the presence and absence of 50 mm NaCl.Analytical Ultracentrifugation Analysis—Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 °C in a Beckman XL-I ProteomeLab analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an absorbance optical system as described before (16Herr A.B. White C.L. Milburn C. Wu C. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For these experiments, two different buffers were used; Buffer A (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4) is identical to that used previously to monitor absorbance and fluorescence changes induced by Ca2+ (6Murphy D.M. Ivanenkov V.V. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and very similar to that used for nucleotidase activity assays, whereas Buffer B (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl) is designed to minimize thermodynamic nonideality caused by charge-charge interactions during sedimentation (Table 1). For sedimentation velocity experiments, 0.85 μm wild-type SCAN was analyzed in the absence and the presence of a divalent cation (2 or 20 mm MgCl2,2 mm CaCl2 or SrCl2) or in the presence of monovalent cation (150 or 300 mm NaCl) at 48,000 rpm. Sedimentation coefficient distributions were determined using the program Sedfit (17Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, the wild-type and E130Y mutant SCANs were analyzed in the absence and the presence of 0.2 mm or2mm CaCl2. Samples at three concentrations (0.25, 1.25, and 2.50 μm) in Buffer A were centrifuged at three different speeds (15,000, 18,000, and 26,000 rpm), whereas samples in Buffer B at two protein concentrations (1.25 and 2.50 μm) were centrifuged at five different speeds (15,000, 18,000, 21,000, 25,000, and 36,000 rpm). For each calcium concentration, a global analysis of the resultant nine or ten data sets was performed using the program WinNONLIN (Jeff Lary, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT).TABLE 1Apparent SCAN dimerization dissociation constants, KD (all values in μm), derived from equilibrium sedimentation experiments in the presence and absence of NaCl and divalent cationsBufferDimerization constant (95% CI) in μmWild-type SCANE130Y SCAN20 mm MOPS 7.4 + 0.2 mm CaCl20.992 (0.670-1.44)20 mm MOPS 7.4 + 2 mm CaCl20.170 (0.109-0.259)20 mm MOPS 7.4 + 20 mm CaCl20.142 (0.086-0.228)20 mm MOPS 7.4 + 2 mm SrCl20.0306 (0.0146-0.0595)20 mm MOPS 7.4/50 mm NaCl + 0 mm CaCl21160 (333-9060)11.8 (9.34-14.9)20 mm MOPS 7.4/50 mm NaCl + 0.2 mm CaCl241.9 (31.4-56.5)1.69 (1.33-2.13)20 mm MOPS 7.4/50 mm NaCl + 2 mm CaCl20.563 (0.384-0.799)0.179 (0.107-0.283) Open table in a new tab Full-length CAN Expression in Mammalian COS Cells—COS-1 cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA encoding wild-type or mutant CAN proteins/100-mm plate using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagents as described previously (10Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Transfection with an empty pcDNA3 vector was also performed as a control. Approximately 48 h post-transfection, the COS-1 cells were harvested, and the crude cell membrane preparations were obtained as described (10Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the alkylating agent, N-ethylmaleimide, was added to the buffer used to homogenize the crude COS cell membranes (final concentration, 2 mm) to prevent oxidation of free sulfhydryls to disulfides during membrane preparation.Crystallization and Structure Determination of Wild-type and E130Y Human SCAN—Crystallization was performed using a sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K in 96-well plates. The crystallization conditions for both wild-type and E130Y SCAN were very similar to that of the wild-type protein crystallized with strontium (7Dai J. Liu J. Deng Y. Smith T.M. Lu M. Cell. 2004; 116: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For wild-type SCAN, 1 μl of protein solution (5.9 mg/ml in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m NaCl) was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (8% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and 10 mm CaCl2) and equilibrated against 100 μl of reservoir solution. For the E130Y mutant,1 μl of protein solution (4.9 mg/ml in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4 and 0.1 m NaCl) was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (16% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and 10 mm CaCl2) and equilibrated against 100 μl reservoir solution. The crystals were cryoprotected by transfer to a mother-liquor solution containing 15% glycerol and flash frozen in a cold nitrogen stream maintained at 110 K. For the wild-type crystal, the data were collected in-house using a Rigaku Micromax-007 generator and an R-Axis IV++ image plate detector. 1080 images were collected as 0.5° oscillations with 10 min of exposure/frame, using two chi orientations (0° and 30°) to give a total of 540° of data with high redundancy. The data, which extended to 2.3 Å resolution, were processed with Crystal-Clear and belonged to space group P1, with the unit-cell parameters a = 43.09 Å, b = 52.37 Å, c = 77.43 Å, α = 75.06°, β = 74.52°, γ = 79.47°. The data for the E130Y crystal were collected at Beamline SER-22ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. A total of 720 images were collected as 0.5° oscillations at λ = 0.97182 Å and processed with the HKL2000 suite. The crystal diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution and belonged to space group P1, with the unit-cell parameters a = 42.89 Å, b = 52.41 Å, c = 77.81 Å, α = 100.94°, β = 106.51°, γ = 99.32°. The crystallographic parameters and statistics of the data collections are listed in Table 3. For both crystals, initial phasing was obtained with Phaser1.3.1 using the published coordinates of wild-type SCAN crystallized with strontium as a search model (Protein Data Bank code 1S1D). In both crystals, two molecules were found in the asymmetric unit, which are related by 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry. All of the crystallographic refinements were performed with Refmac5 (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13774) Google Scholar). Fig. 9 was created using Pymol. Analyses of buried surface area and surface complementarity were carried out using Areaimol and Sc, respectively, from the CCP4 suite. The data collection and refinement statistics are reported in Table 3.TABLE 3SCAN crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionWild type (Protein Data Bank 2H2N)E130Y (Protein Data Bank 2H2U)SourceRigaku RA-Micro007APS SER-22IDWavelength (Å)1.541780.97182Space groupP1P1Unit cell a, b, c (Å)43.09, 52.37, 77.4342.89, 52.41, 77.81α, β, γ (°)75.06, 74.52, 79.47100.94, 106.51, 99.32Resolution range (Å)aThe values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.31.08-2.30 (2.38-2.30)50.00-2.40 (2.49-2.40)Completeness (%)99.7 (99.3)86.8 (83.8)Reflections (observed/unique)150511/2772736128/24181Average redundancy5.43 (5.13)1.70 (1.50)Average I/σ(I)17.9 (4.9)13.2 (2.81)Rmerge (%)bRmerge = ∑|I - 〈I 〉|/∑I.5.8 (17.8)6.5 (45.1)Model refinementResolution range (Å)31.08-2.3050.00-2.40Reflections (work/test)26332/139519868/1092Rwork/Rfree (%)c∑||Fo| - |Fc||/∑|Fo| for all data except for 5%, which was used for the Rfree calculation.16.8/24.921.3/29.9Root mean square deviations from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.0270.012Bond angles (°)2.1361.488No. of residues in molecule (A/B)317/315315/317Missing residues in molecule (A/B)22/2424/22No. of water molecules22835No. of calcium ions22No. of acetate ions10Ramachandran plotResiduesMost favored486 residues, 89.0%466 residues, 85.3%Additional allowed60 residues, 11.0%76 residues, 13.9%Generously allowed0 residues, 0%4 residues, 0.7%a The values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.b Rmerge = ∑|I - 〈I 〉|/∑I.c ∑||Fo| - |Fc||/∑|Fo| for all data except for 5%, which was used for the Rfree calculation.

https://openalex.org/W2003754036,"Necrotic is a member of the serine protease inhibitor or serpin superfamily. It is a potent inhibitor of elastase and chymotrypsin type proteases and is responsible for regulating the anti-fungal response in Drosophila melanogaster. Necrotic contains three basic lysine residues within the D-helix that are homologous to those found in the heparin-binding domain of antithrombin and heparin co-factor II. We show here that substitution of all three lysine residues for glutamines caused cellular necrosis and premature death in Drosophila in keeping with a loss of function phenotype. The lysine to glutamine substitutions had no effect on the overall structure of recombinant Necrotic protein but abolished the formation of stable complexes with target proteases. Individual substitutions with either glutamine or alanine demonstrated that lysine 68 was the most critical residue for inhibitory activity. Despite the homology to other serpins, Necrotic did not bind, nor was it activated by sulfated glycans. These data demonstrate a critical role for basic residues within the D-helix (and lysine 68 in particular) in the inhibitory mechanism of the serpin Necrotic."
