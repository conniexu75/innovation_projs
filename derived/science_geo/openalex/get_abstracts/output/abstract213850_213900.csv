https://openalex.org/W2070883366,"EARLIER papers dealing with the microbial degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) have indicated that fission may be the ultimate fate of the aromatic ring. Thus Rogoff and Reid1 detected an almost quantitative production of chloride ion by an organism belonging to the genus Corynebacterium, isolated from soil, while Fernley and Evans2 obtained α-chloromuconic acid as a metabolite using a soil Pseudomonas sp., although under certain conditions the latter workers found 2,4-dichlorophenol to be the main product."

https://openalex.org/W2059175622,"WE report a new chemical method for determining the aflatoxins and, in particular, aflatoxin B1. Previous methods have depended on the measurement of fluorescence1,2 and are subject to certain errors, for example, quenching by impurities. Moreover, it is known that the fluorescence of solutions of aflatoxin B1 in methanol varies with time3."

https://openalex.org/W2067628989,"THE phenomena of hibernation and aestivation have both been recorded in the genus Citellus, and although it is not known whether the two phenomena are physiologically the same1, nevertheless hibernation seems to be an adaptation to an unfavourable cold seasonal environment, and aestivation an adaptation to an arid hot environment with seasonal drought. It is of interest, therefore, to find that the rock ground squirrel, Citellus variegatus, the habitat of which is the arid south-west from Utah to southern Mexico2, is capable of hibernating but does not appear to sestivate. Hibernation as used here refers to a mammal with a homothermic temperature of approximately 37° C, but which is able to lower this temperature to the environment and raise it again against the gradient."

https://openalex.org/W2087139020,"DURING the course of an investigation made by the Central Veterinary Laboratory into the incidence of leptospiral infection in small wild mammals a number of strains were recovered. Most of these apparently belong to the hebdomadis group, but one strain, W. V.14, from a water vole, was serologically in the autumnalis group. It was finally identified in Amsterdam as L. erinacei auriti as shown in Table 1. An apparent relationship to grippo-typhosa and butembo in cross-agglutination tests was not confirmed by absorption tests."

However, the media described sustained luxurious growth of P. tularensis when relatively large numbers of cells (about 106 to 5 × 106/ml. medium) were used for inoculation. Attempts to reduce the size of the inoculum by supplementing the media with a variety of vitamins, tissue extracts and other preparations noted for their growth-promoting ability, were by and large unsuccessful. The nutritional fastidiousness of P. tularensis appeared particularly puzzling in view of the notoriously extreme infectivity of this micro-organism, which is reputed to be capable of multiplying in vivo out of a few cells3. Furthermore, both highly virulent and completely avirulent strains exhibited the same pattern of growth requirements."
