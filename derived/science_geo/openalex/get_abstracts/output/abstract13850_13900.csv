https://openalex.org/W1535345009,"Gamma-Glutamyl-cysteine synthetase is inhibited by glutathione under conditions similar to those which prevail in vivo, thus strongly suggesting a physiologically significant feedback mechanism. Inhibition by glutathione, which is not allosteric, appears to involve the binding of glutathione to the glutamate site of the enzyme as well as to another enzyme site; the latter binding appears to require a sulfhydryl group since ophthalmic acid (gamma-glutamyl-alpha-aminobutyryl-glycine) is only a weak inhibitor. The finding that glutathione regulates its own synthesis by inhibiting synthesis of gamma-glutamyl-cysteine appears to explain observations on patients with 5-oxoprolinuria, who were shown to have a block in the gamma-glutamyl cycle consisting of a marked deficiency of glutathione synthetase and consequently of glutathione. These patients produce greater than normal amounts of gamma-glutamyl-cysteine, which is converted by the action of gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase to 5-oxoproline; production of the latter compound exceeds the capacity of 5-oxoprolinase to convert it to glutamate. The apparent Km value for L-cysteine for gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (0.35 mM) is not far from intracellular concentrations of L-cysteine suggesting that the availability of L-cysteine may also play a role in the regulation of glutathione synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1525383206,"The coordinates of the individual non-hydrogen atoms of the lectin concanavalin A have been determined from the molecular model at 2.0-A resolution and have been adjusted to make them consistent with the known stereochemistry of the constituent amino acid residues. From the coordinates, an analysis has been made of all intra- and intersubunit interactions in the molecule, yielding a description of the hydrogen-bonded structure of the monomer, including two extensive pleated sheet structures and other features of the folding of the polypeptide chain. The description of the noncovalent bonding is extended to include the interactions involved in stabilization of the dimeric and tetrameric structures of the molecule. The complete description of the molecular structure provides a basis for analysis of the biological activities of concanavalin A."
https://openalex.org/W1483264458,"The three-dimensional structure of the lectin concanavalin A (Con A) has been determined at 2.0-A resolution by x-ray diffraction analysis. The protomers are ellipsoidal domes of dimensions 42 times 40 times 39 A. Folding of the polypeptide backbone is dominated by the presence of two antiparallel pleated sheets, a twisted sheet of seven strands passing through the center of the molecule and a bowed sheet of six strands which forms the back surface of the monomer. Manganese and calcium ions bind to the protein at adjoining sites to form a binuclear complex of two octahedra sharing a common edge. The ligands for each metal ion are four groups from the NH2-terminal region of the protein and 2 water molecules. The binding site for the inhibitor beta-(o-iodophenyl)-D-glucopyranoside is in a deep cavity which contains distinct hydrophobic and hydrophilic binding subsites. Studies of the binding of beta-(o-iodophenyl)-D-glucopyranoside to Con A in the crystalline state and in solution have indicated that the binding behavior of the protein is somewhat different in the two states."

https://openalex.org/W1577858618,"We describe a method, called affinity partitioning, for the purification of proteins containing specific ligand binding receptor sites. This method adds specificity to the procedures for protein purification with aqueous polymer two-phase systems by introduction of a polymer derivative, coupled to an appropriate ligand. The addition of a polymer-ligand that partitions predominantly into one phase shifts the protein that binds this substance to the same phase. By performing countercurrent distribution in the presence of a polymer-ligand, the protein that binds the polymer-ligand can be separated from a heterogenous mixture. One example of affinity paritioning used dextran as the polymer-ligand. Dextran was chosen since it is a constituent of the most commonly used system for partitioning proteins. In a dextran-poly(ethylene oxide) system, concanavalin A bound dextran and partitioned predominantly into the dextran-rich phase. The addition of the specific competitor, D-mannose, displaced the partition coefficient toward unity, while the application of L-fucose, a noncompetitor, had little effect. Application of affinity partitioning to the purification of another protein required the synthesis of a specific polymer-ligand. To study this we synthesized dinitrophenyl-poly-(ethylene oxide), which binds specifically to S-23 myeloma protein. Addition of dinitrophenyl-poly(ethylene oxide) to the dextran-poly(ethylene oxide) phase system shifted the S-23 myeloma protein into the poly(ethylene oxide)-rich phase. epsilon-N-dinitrophenyl-L-lysine, by competing with binding of dinitrophenyl-poly(ethylene oxide), antagonized the latter's effect on the partition coefficient of S-23 myeloma protein. By adding various amounts of dinitrophenyl-poly-(ethylene oxide), we correlated the partition coefficient with concentration of polymer-ligand. A model of the action of polymer-ligand derivatives on the partition coefficient, derived from thermodynamic considerations, was found to be consistent with the experimental data relating the concentration of polymer-ligand and partition coefficient. Affinity partitioning should prove to be a useful complement to affinity chromatography in the purification of mixtures of proteins. Since cells and subcellular particles may be purified with aqueous polymer two-phase systems, affinity partitioning might be applied to their fractionation by using polymer-ligands specific for unique surface receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1583731893,"The effect of insulin on turnover of protein was investigated in isolated perfused rat hearts. The hormone lowered intracellular levels of nine amino acids and reduced or abolished net release of 10 amino acids and ammonia. The extent of the insulin effect on protein degradation was investigated by estimating the rate of dilution of the specific radioactivity of the free phenylalanine pool. Insulin concentrations greater than 200 microunits per ml reduced protein degradation and net phenlylalanine release. Protein degradation was estimated more directly by inhibiting reincorporation of nonradioactive phenylalanine from protein with cycloheximide. Addition of the inhibitor increased the estimated rates about 50%, but the magnitude of the hormone effect was similar. The latency of lysosomal enzymes in control and insulin-treated hearts was assessed by measuring activities of beta-acetylglucosaminidase and cathepsin D in heart homogenates in the presence and absence of Triton X-100. Perfusion with insulin-free buffer increased the activities assayable without detergent, but did not change total activities of these enzymes. Insulin decreased activities assayable without detergent and increased activities sedimenting in the 10-5 times g pellet. These studies showed that insulin restricted the rate of protein degradation in the isolated perfused rat heart. Concomitantly, the latency of lysosomal enzymes was increased when the hormone was provided."
https://openalex.org/W1543259102,"The loosely bound chromatin proteins of Ehrlich ascites hyperdiploid cells have been prepared by extraction of chromatin with 0.35 M NaCl. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the 0.35 M NaCl-soluble chromatin proteins reveals high heterogeneity with a molecular weight range of 10,000 to 170,000. The 0.35 M NaCl-soluble chromatin proteins contain many components similar to the more tightly bound non-histone chromatin proteins complex with the loosely bound chromatin proteins by gradient dialysis, the inhibitory effect of histones on transcription of DNA in vitro was reduced. The reconstituted complex manifested a level of template activity similar to that of native chromatin as measured in an Ehrlich ascites tumor RNA polymerase reaction. The loosely bound chromatin proteins contain RNA as well as phosphoproteins. Phenol extraction or DNA affinity chromatography of these proteins yielded fractions enhanced 25- to 30-fold in phosphorus which were capable of stimulating DNA-templated RNA synthesis in vitro. The stimulation of transcription from DNA was template-specific, effective only with a DNA template prepared from Ehrlich ascites tumor, but not from rat liver, calf thymus, or chicken erythrocytes. In addition, the stimulatory effect of the specific DNA-binding proteins appears to be RNA polymerase-specific, the stimulation being manifested with Ehrlich ascites tumor nucleoplasmic RNA polymerase and not with Micrococcus luteus RNA polymerase. Thus, the loosely bound chromosomal proteins from Ehrlich ascites tumor contain a fraction that specifically binds to Ehrlich ascites tumor DNA and exhibits a template- and RNA polymerase-specific stimulatory effect on transcription from DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1585586097,"The amino acid sequence of the COOH-terminal CNBr fragment, F3 (residues 130 to 237), of concanavalin A has been established, completing the determination of the covalent structure of this lectin. Analysis of the chemical sequence showed that the distribution of charged residues is generally more dense in the NH2-terminal half of the polypeptide chain than in the COOH-terminal portion and that in the latter region there is a linear stretch composed of many hydrophobic residues. Correlation with x-ray crystallographic results indicates that the hydrophobic region is located in the interior of the molecule, and that it forms a part of a deep cavity which is the binding site for the inhibitor, beta-(o-iodophenyl)-D-glucopyranoside. In conjunction with the three-dimensional structure, the amino acid sequence reported here provides new data for analysis of variables involved in predicting the three-dimensional folding of proteins from the primary structure. The sequence of concanavalin A is the first determined for a lectin and it serves as a reference structure for comparisons with other lectins."

https://openalex.org/W1481181638,"In this communication we describe the first method for isolating human Factor V. The final product contains no other coagulation components as judged by functional assays and is physically homogeneous as shown by isofocusing gel electrophoresis. In addition, we present a means for obtaining intrinsically activated human Factor X-a. This preparation is usually homogeneous as judged by isofocusing gel electrophoresis. However, on occasion, an additional minor electrophoretic species with Factor X-a activity is observed. Furthermore, we describe the use of isoelectric focusing in sucrose density gradients to free human prothrombin from contamination by coagulation factors and other components. These homogeneous human proteins are employed to examine the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin in the presence and absence of human antithrombin. The latter component is responsible for virtually all of the plasm's capacity to neutralize Factor X-a and thrombin. In the absence of antithrombin, prothrombin (67,800) is converted to the precursor P-2 (51,600) and the fragment F-a (19,500). Subsquently, P-2 is cleaved to form the precursor P-3 (37,000), and the fragment F-b (11,500). Finally, P3 IS proteolyzed to form the heavy chain T-h (29,500) and the light chain T-L (6,500) of active thrombin. In the presence of antithrombin, an additional prothrombin conversion pathway is observed in which the zymogen is directly cleaved to form P-3 and F-A + B (30,000) prior to thrombin generation. Trace amounts of free thrombin remain uninhibited by antithrombin and could bias the zymogen activation pathway. Hirudin is known to neutralized thrombin instantaneoulsly. We demonstrate that the purified leech protein also binds to P-3 and prevents thrombin formation. When hirudin is added to activation mixtures at concentrations sufficient to virtually suppress P-3 conversion to thrombin, molecular species from both activation pathways are observed. Thus two human prothrombin conversion sequences appear to be initiated by Factor X-3 and may be of physiological significance."
https://openalex.org/W1535309607,"Hen oviduct ovalbumin messenger RNA has been purified to apparent homogeneity and its physical and molecular properties have been examined. Purification was achieved through the use of indirect immunoprecipitation to isolate ovalbumin synthesizing polysomes and the use of poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography to separate quantitatively ovalbumin messenger RNA from ribosomal RNA. Ovalbumin mRNA was purified 90 to 100-fold over oviduct polysomal RNA as judged by both the rate of hybridization to a complementary DNA and by translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate protein-synthesizing system. Isolated ovalbumin mRNA migrates as a single sharp symmetrical peak on sucrose gradient sedimentation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of ovalbumin mRNA determined by sedimentation in denaturing dimethylsulfoxide gradients is 700,000 (equivalent to 2,180 nucleotides). The complexity of purified ovalbumin mRNA determined from the relative rate of hybridization to a complementary DNA is 2,280 nucleotides. Since ovalbumin synthesis requires only 1,161 nucleotides, ovalbumin mRNA appears to contain approximately 1,150 untranslated nucleotides. The average length of the polyadenylate sequence in ovalbumin mRNA is only 44 nucleotides and it does not account for significant fraction of the untranslated nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W2124571763,"An eight-step procedure has been devised for the preparation of homogeneous rabbit reticulocyte IF-M1. Molecular weight determinations based on IF-M1 activity (gel filtration and sucrose density gradient sedimentation) and based on IF-M1 protein (low speed equilibrium sedimentation and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis) indicate that IF-M1 is active as a single polypeptide chain of 65,000 molecular weight. The amino acid composition of IF-M1 has been determined. There appears to be no unique features in the amino acid composition of IF-M1, except perhaps an elevated proline content (6.9 mol %). The catalytic properties of purified IF-M1 were similar to those previously reported by this laboratory for crude preparations of IF-M1. The sensitivity of IF-M1 activity to N-ethylmaleimide and heat (45 degrees) inactivation was tested in two model reactions requiring minimal complementary factors: (a) AUG-directed fMet-tRNAf binding to ribosomes; and (b) poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis at 4 mM Mg2+ (IF-M2A, IF-M2B, EF-1, and EF-2 also required). IF-M1 activity proved to be sensitive to both N-ethylmaleimide and temperature (45 degrees). In addition, a contaminant of partially purified IF-M1 preparations has been found which is capable of fMet-tRNAf binding but is inactive in poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis at low Mg2+ concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1564662973,"The absorption spectrum of deoxygenated human hemoglobin differs from that of the isolated alpha and beta chains, and the difference has been ascribed to the conformational changes on which depends the cooperative ligand binding. Studies on hybrid-heme hemoglobins, in which one chain contains protoheme and the other chain mesoheme, showed that the prominent peak in the Soret region of the difference spectrum for deoxyhemoglobin is due to the spectral change in alpha chains and that beta chains show a small trough in the Soret region at the wavelength 10 nm longer than that for the absorption peak. Difference spectra of oxygenated hybrid-heme hemoglobin showed only small peaks which seem to be due to the spectral changes in beta chains. Difference spectra of alpha-NO-beta-unliganded hemoglobin showed a large negative band in the Soret region at the wavelength of the absorption peak for alpha-NO chains, and beta-unliganded chains in this half-liganded hemoglobin showed a small trough corresponding to that of beta chains in fully unliganded hemoglobin. Alpha-Unliganded-beta-NO chains, however, showed only small peaks in the difference spectra. The peaks in difference spectra ascribed to each chain did not completely correlate with the kinetic results reported for hybrid-heme hemoglobin (Nakamura, T., Sugita, Y., Bannai, S. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4119-4122) and for half-liganded hemoglobin (Antonini, E., Brunori, H., Wyman, J., and Noble, R.W. (1966) J. Biol. Chem. 241, 3236-3238). Spectral change when alpha and beta chains were mixed was a second order reaction for deoxygenated hemoglobin and was a first order reaction for oxygenated and alpha-NO-beta-unliganded hemoglobin, suggesting the different rate-limiting steps."

Three distinct conformation states of the protein have been kinetically observed and an ordered binding mechanism elucidated from a detailed analysis of the reaction records. In addition, the individual steps of this mechanism are interpreted in terms of molecular parameters characterizing the conformational states involved such as ligand exchange rates to the paramagnetic Mn++."
https://openalex.org/W1530586599,"An attempt was made to gain insight into the mechanism of orthophosphate attenuation of glucose-6-P inhibition of bovine brain hexokinase I (ADP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) from experiments of ligand binding and initial rate kinetics. Studies of glucose-6-P and phosphate binding to hexokinase reveal one binding site per hexokinase molecule. A model is presented which is consistent with the binding and kinetic data currently available on the alleviation of glucose-6-P inhibition of brain hexokinase by phosphate. The model implies that hexokinase may exist in equilibrium either as a free or phosphate-associated enzyme. The kinetic parameters of the two enzyme forms are similar except in their ability to bind glucose-6-P. It is suggested that the dissociation constant for glucose-6-P is relatively very high for hexokinase to which phosphate is bound. Phosphate appears to bind at an allosteric site on the enzyme, whereas glucose-6-P is associated either at the active site or at an allosteric site which overlaps the catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1530729266,"The mycobacterial polysaccharides MMP (3-O-methyl-mannose-containing polysaccharide), MGLP (lipolysaccharide containing 6-O-methylglucose and glucose), and the cyclodextrins (cyclohexaamylose and cycloheptaamylose) form stoichiometric complexes with palmitoyl-CoA (Machida, Y., Bergeron, R., Flick, P., and Bloch, K. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6246-6247). Complex formation is presumed to result from hydrophobic interactions. In order to enhance the hydrophobic character of the cyclodextrins the following derivatives have been synthesized: heptakis (2,di-O-propyl)-, heptakis (2,6-di-O-methyl)-, pentakis (6-O-methyl)-, heptakis (3-O-methyl)-, and permethylated beta-cyclo-dextrin. These compounds stimulate fatty acid synthesis catalyzed by the Mycobacterium smegmatis fatty acid synthetase, the magnitude of the effect decreasing in the order in which the alkylated cyclodextrins are listed above. MMP or MGLP are qualitatively indistinguishable from alkylated cyclodextrins both with respect to palmitoyl-CoA binding and with respect to effects on enzyme systems, suggesting that they form inclusion complexes of the same type. On the basis of model building it is postulated that MMP in solution assumes a helical conformation with a hydrophobic channel about 6 A in diameter and approximately 29 A long, dimensions appropriate for accommodating the paraffinic chain of palmitoyl-CoA in the form of an inclusion complex. Since palmitoyl-CoA binds to polysaccharide much more tightly than free palmitate it is further postulated that ionized groups of the CoA moiety of acyl CoA participate in the binding and do so by hydrogen bonding to the hydrophilic exterior of helical MMP. Palmitoyl-CoA, and to a lesser extent palmitate, affect the optical rotation of MMP and also of the alkylated cyclodextrins indicating that complex formation induces conformational changes in the polysaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W1850288978,"Pineapple stem acetone powder provides a rich source of the sulfhydryl protease bromelain and of a family of compositionally similar but chromatographically distinct polypeptide inihibtors of this enzyme. The isoinhibitors have molecular weights of 5600, and they contain five disulfide bonds and about 50 amino acids each (Perlstein, S. H., AND Kezdy, F.J. (1973) J. Supramol. Struct. 1, 249-254). Primary structural analysis of one of the seven inhibitor fractions (VII) revealed extensive microheterogeneity. Each of the inhibitor molecules in Fraction VII was shown to be composed of two peptide chains joined by disulfide bonds. These chains, designated A and B on the basis of size, comprise 41 and 10-11 residues, respectively, and the amino acid sequence of one of each are given below: (see article for formular). On the basis of ionization properties and yields of the A and B chains, it would appear that one of the major inhibitor species in Fraction VII is the covalently linked complex of the two chains shown, namely [A-1, B-2]. The second major inhibitor component of Fraction VII is identical in structure with [A-1, B-2i1 except that residues 1 and 8 in the A chain are pyroglutamate and threonine, respectively, and in the B chain glutamine 11 is replaced by arginine. The third inhibitor in Fraction VII is a minor constituent identical with the second, except that residue 1 in the A chain is glutamate rather than pyroglutamate. This microheterogeneity in the inhibitors of Fraction VII is further increased by the fact that B chains may lack threonine 1, in which case they are decapeptides beginning with alanine. On the basis of the striking homology of the cysteine residues with those of other protease inhibitors, it is proposed that the bromelain inhibitors are generated enzymatically from single chain precursors by excision of a bridge paptide which links the NH-2 termal A chain to the COOH-terminal B chain."
https://openalex.org/W1596769430,"The COOH-terminal tetradecapeptide of ribonuclease A, Glu-Gly-Asn-Pro-Tyr-Val-Pro-Val-His-Phe-Asp-Ala-Ser-Val, and two analogs, [Ser(Me)-123]-RNase 111-124 and [Ala-123]-RNase 111-124, were synthesized by the solid phase method and were purified to chromatographic and electrophoretic homogeneity. Methods are described for the hydrolysis and quantitative amino acid analysis of peptides containing O-methylserine. The peptides were combined noncovalently with RNase 1-118 and examined for ability to regenerate enzymatic activity in the presence of the substrates C greater than p, U greater than p, poly(C) poly(U), and poly(AF). The dissociation constants of the peptide-protein complexes, and the Michaelis constants for C greater than p and U greater than p with the reconstituted enzymes were determined. The data were used to test hypotheses, drawn from x-ray crystallographic and other studies, for the role of serine-123 in the binding of substrates by ribonuclease. It was found that Ser-123- and Ala-123-containing peptides were equally active for the hydrolysis step when measured with C greater than p as substrate and for the transphosphorylation step as measured in the assays with poly(C). The serine and alanine analogs were also equally active for the transphosphorylation step when poly AF was the substrate. With U greater than p as substrate the alanine analog was 4 times less active than the serine derivative and with poly U it was 2 times less active. The semisynthetic enzyme composed of RNase 1-118 and [Ala-123]-RNase 111-124, therefore, shows appreciable selectivity for substrates containing cytosine. It was concluded that a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of serine-123 and the C4 amino group of cytidine or the C-7 amino group of formycin is not important for substrate binding and catalytic activity. In contrast, the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of serine 123 and the C-4 carbonyl oxygen of uridine contributes significantly to substrate binding and catalytic activity. The data with serine-O-methyl ether at position 123 in the tetradecapeptide were less clear because it was difficult to separate steric effects from the contributions of hydrogen bonding. Substrate binding to ribonuclease was rationalized in terms of a binding energy equivalent to a total of two hydrogen bonds per pyrimidine."
https://openalex.org/W1485026663,"Salmonid fish, as a result of total genome duplication, have two genes, Ldh H and Ldh H', coding for polypeptides H and H', respectively, both of which have been shown in their tetrameric forms to be immunologically related to the classical H-4 lactate dehydrogenase isozyme of higher vertebrates (Bailey, G. S., and Wilson, A. C. (1968) J. Biol. Chem. 243,5843). The H-4 and H'-4 isozymes have now been highly purified from quinnat salmon, and their chemical, physical, immunological, and catalytic properties examined, and compared to the M-4 isozyme of salmon. The two proteins H-4 and H'-4 are shown to be very similar in amino acid composition, but significant differences in a few residues suggest differences in amino acid sequences. This suggestion was born out by quantitative immunological experiments in which the H-4 and H'-4 isozymes were shown to be about as different from each other as are the H-4 lactate dehydrogenases of chicken and duck. This suggests that the gene duplication event in salmon which give rise to two Ldh H genes occurred approximately 80 to 100 million years ago. The H'-4 lactate dehydrogenase which has risen from this duplication in salmon is shown to be somewhat intermediate between H-4 and M-4 in thermal stability, and in all catalytic properties examined, including substrate optima, Michaelis constants, and susceptibility to inhibition by high levels of substrate. In particular the H'-4 isozyme is almost exactly intermediate between H-4 and M-4 in its resistance to product inhibition by lactate, the catalytic parameter suggested to be of major functional importance to M-4 lactate dehydrogenase isozymes (Stambaugh, R., and Post D. (1966) J. Biol. Chem. 241,1462). Further, tissue distribution of these isozymes in salmon and trout are shown to be unusual. The M-4 isozyme salmon and trout are shown to be unusual. The M-4 isozyme occurs in very few tissues in detectable levels. It is the H-4 and H'-4 rather than H-4 and M-4, which occur in independently variable but significant levels in most tissues examined. Thus the H'-4 isozyme, despite its very close structural similarity to H-4 appears to possess functional properties which are different from either H-4 or M-4 in salmon, and some properties are midway between the two. This finding, together with the unusual tissue distribution of these isozymes, suggests that salmon with H'-4 lactate dehydrogenase is evolving to function catalytically in the absence of a balanced H-4-M-4 isozyme complement in most tissues. This balance seems to be met in most tissues by combinations of H-4 and H'-4,"
https://openalex.org/W1566234860,"The venoms of sea snakes (family: Hydrophiidae) contain potent neurotoxins which bind to the acetylcholine receptor in the neuromuscular junction. A major toxin was isolated from the venoms of the sea snakes Lapemis hardwickii and Enhydrina schistosa according to previously published methods. These pure toxins were studied by laser Raman spectroscopy to elucidate further the structure-function relationship to the neurotoxin. Spectra were obtained from the powder, aqueous solution, and deuterated derivatives of each toxin. The peptide backbone conformation of these neurotoxins was found to be of anti-parallel beta configuration, as distinct amide I and III bands appeared at 1672 and 1240 cm-1, respectively. No indication of alpha helical structure in the neurotoxins was observed from amide I and III bands. This was further confirmed by the spectra of the neurotoxins after deuterium exchange. The peaks due to a single tyrosine residue appeared at 644, 834, and 846 cm-1. The intensity ratios of the toxin from L. hardwickii venom were 0.92, 1.0, and 0.84 at 644, 834, and 846 cm-1. It is concluded that the tyrosine residue is involved in some unusual intramolecular interactions and not readily accessible to water molecules. Similar results were obtained for the toxin of Enhydrina schistosa (common sea snake). The fact that only 50% of the tyrosine molecule is modified by nitration is in complete agreement with laser Raman result. The lack of a sharp Raman line at 1361 cm-1 suggested that the single tryptophan residue may be exposed. The previous demonstration that the tryptophan residue can be modified readily with different reagents confirms these results. A relatively symmetrical disulfide peak at 512 cm-1 indicates that the geometry of the C-C-S-S-C-C linkage is nearly identical for all four disulfide bonds in the molecule. The absence of phenylalanine was established by the lack of a phenylalanine peak in the laser Raman spectra and by amino acid analysis."

IFO-13310, bacteria which exhibit a symbiotic growth in a medium containing keratin sulfate as a sole carbon source, were isolated from soil. Extracts of these organisms were shown to contain an endoglycosidase, a sulfatase, and exo-beta-D-galactosidase, and an exo-beta-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase which, together, catalyze an extensive cleavage of corneal keratan sulfate. The Pseudomonas extract was particularly rich in the endoglycosidase activity and poor in the exoglycosidase activities. The Actinobacillus extract, in sharp contrast, contained principally the exoglycosidases. The sulfatase activity did not show this marked difference in distribution. A sulfatase was purified from the crude extract of Actinobacillus. The purified sulfatase reacted little or not at all with keratan sulfate, but acted on 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-D-glucose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1 leads to 3)-D-galactose, and a tetrasaccharide trisulfate having 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-D-glucose at the nonreducing end (prepared from keratan sulfate with an endogalactosidase). The enzyme removed one sulfate group from the tetrasaccharide trisulfate, producing an oligosaccharide which, unlike the parent oligosaccharide, was susceptible to hydrolysis with exo-beta-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The data suggest that the nonreducing end is the only site at wich enzymatic desulfation is carried out."

Purified mannan, isolated by extraction of whole cells with hot, aqueous phenol, binds to membranes in vitro. Mannan also binds to DEAE-cellulose and migrates toward the anode in neutral and sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis. In aqueous solution mannan has an apparent molecular weight of 10-6, but in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate its apparent molecular weight is 50,000 to 100,000; removal of the detergent results in reaggregation. Purified mannan contains mannose, succinate, fatty acid, and glycerol in a ratio of 50:4.9:2.1:1.0. Treatment of mannan with mild base produces a neutral, hydrophilic polysaccharide of relatively low molecular weight that has no affinity for membranes. At least 90% of the reducing termini are blocked in a base-stable linkage. Based on these results a tentative structure is proposed for the mannan."
https://openalex.org/W1493024037,"Serine transhydroxymethylase forms three enzyme-glycine complexes which absorb at 3.43, 425, and 495 nm. Temperature-jump studies show three relaxations.

The absorbance changes for the two relaxations observable at 343 and 425 nm are in opposite directions suggesting that these relaxations are both attributable to the inter conversion of enzyme speiies absorbing at these two wavelengths. The following mechanism is proposed to explain the relaxation effects. See journal for formula. The forward and reverse rate constants for the first step are 7 X 10-4 M-MINUS1 sminus-1 and 1200 Sminus-1, respectively. The forward and reverse rate constants for the second step are 3200 and 1300 sminus-1, respective.y Stopped flow studies on the rate of formation and breakdown of the complexes absorbing at 343 nm (EX) and 425 nm (EY) are in agreement with the proposed mechanism. Stopped flow studies gave a Kobs of 0.1 Sminus-1 for the formation of the 495-nm absorbing complex. This is compared to the reciprocal relaxation time of 200 Sminus-1 observed in the temperature-jump studies. The addition of tetrahydrofolate to this system increased the Kobs to 275 Sminus-1 in the stopped flow studies and the reciprocal relaxation time to 800 Sminus-1 in the temperature-jump studies. The data do not permit a simple interpretation of the relationship of the 495-nm absorbing complex to those adsorbing at 343 and 425 nm. However, the data do support the interpretation that the ability of tetrahydrofolate to increase by 3 orders of magnitude the enzyme-catalyzed rate of exchange of the alpha-hydrogen of glycine with protons of the solvent is attributable to an increased rate of formation of the 495-nm complex."

https://openalex.org/W1506760415,"Hydrogen-1 and phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of 5'-AMP, 5'-GMP, 8-aza-5'-GMP, adenosine, 8-aza-adenosine, and guanosine were obtained at biological pH values at a concentration sufficiently low to obtain information regarding their intramolecular solution conformation. The spectra were analyzed by computer simulation. It is shown that all of the above nucleosides and nucleotides have a flexible molecular framework in aqueous solution, 5'-AMP and 5'-GMP showing preference for anti(2-E in equilibrium 3-E)gg-g'g' conformations and the 8-aza analogs showing preference for (syn in equilibrium anti)-(2E in equilibrium 3-E) - g/t-g'g' conformations. In addition, aza substitution causes increase in 3-E sugar populations and in the populations of g'/t' conformers. It is argued that in the 8-aza analogs repulsive electrostatic interactions would prevail between --N (see article) at the 8 position and the negatively charged phosphate group, if the molecule existed in the anti-gg orientation. Such electrostatic repulsions can be relieved by rotating the C(4')--C(5') bond from gg to g/t orientations as well as by torsional variation about the glycosidic linkage from anti to syn conformation. Rotation from anti to syn orientation, for steric and electrostatic reasons, necessitates a simultaneous rotation about the C(4')--C(5') bond from gg to g/t conformation. The observation that the 8-aza substitution in 5'-beta-purine nucleotides cause a depopulation of gg and anti conformers with corresponding increase in the population of g/t and syn orientation seems to support the above thesis. The finding that rotational variation about a bond such as C(4')--C(5') is accompanied by torsional variation about C(5')--O(5') and the glycosidic bonds, as well as changes in the endocyclic torsion angles of the ribose moiety, gives important insight into the engineering of nucleic acid components: even though they in general prefer certain conformations, there is enough flexibility present in their molecular framework, that the entire system can undergo conformational adjustment in response to a perturbation. A conformational basis for the antileukemic effects of 8-aza purines is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1519961776,"A crude soluble preparation of human hepatic N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidase was examined for its activities toward three natural glycosphingolipid substrates after fractionation by the isoelectric focusing procedure. Profiles of activities toward N-acetylgalactosaminyl-galactosyl-glucosylceramide (asialo GM2-ganglioside) and N-acetylgalactosaminyl-galactosyl-galactosyl-glucosylceramide (globoside) were always identical with that of nonspecific N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidase as determined with artificial substrates. The Component A of the enzyme had the activity peak at an isoelectric point of 5.0 to 5.1. In contrast, hydrolytic activities toward N-acetylgalactosaminyl-[N-acetylneuraminyl]galactosyl- glucosylceramide (GM2-ganglioside) were associated with only the most acidic subfraction of the hexosaminidase A component. The activity to hydrolyze GM2-ganglioside had its peak at an isoelectric point of 4.8 to 4.9. These findings might provide an explanation for the GM2-ganglioside accumulation in juvenile GM2-gangliosidosis (partial deficiency of hexosaminidase A) and in the so-called AB variant of GM2-gangliosidosis (apparently normal hexosaminidase A and B activity)."
https://openalex.org/W1498519079,"Transcarboxylase consists of a central 12 SH subunits each of which is linked to the central subunit by two similar to 1.3 SE biotin carboxyl carrier proteins. The subunits from dissociated transcarboxylase have been difficult to isolate because conditions which stabilize them also promote their reassociation to the intact enzyme. In this paper, we describe the use of avidin-Sepharose to adsorb the enzyme from crude extracts or partially purified transcarboxylase of propionibacteria. After removing impurities by washing the column with phosphate buffer at pH 6.5, in which the transcarboxylase is stable, the enzyme is dissociated first by elution at pH 8 yielding a fraction containing mostly 12 SH subunit which can be rapidly stabilized against dissociation to 6 SH without the problem of reconstitution because the 1.3 SE and most of the 5 SE subunits are not eluted. The second elution is at pH 9 which yields the 5 SE subunit by dissociation from the 1.3 SE biotin subunit and the 1.3 SE subunit remains bound to the avidin. The 12 SH and 5 SE subunits are further purified by glycerol density gradient centrifugation or by chromatography on Bio-Gel. Very active enzyme can be reconstituted from these subunits upon the addition of the 1.3 SE subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2157202304,"In turkey erythrocytes, potassium influx can be inhibited by several cations whose order of effectiveness is Rb greater than Cs greater than Li greater than Mg = Ca = Ba. Extracellular sodium does not alter potassium influx. Sodium influx is not altered by any of these monovalent cations but magnesium, calcium, or barium reduced sodium influx by 30 to 40%. Potassium outflux is not influenced by extracellular sodium or potassium while sodium outflux is not influenced by extracellular potassium but increases progressively with increasing extracellular sodium. Isoproterenol stimulates potassium influx only when sodium or lithium is present in the medium and catecholamine stimulation increases progressively with increasing extracellular sodium. Isoproterenol-stimulated sodium influx is enhanced by extracellular potassium, rubidium or cesium, and catecholamine stimulation increases progressively with increasing extracellular potassium. Isoproterenol inhibits potassium outflux in a solution free of sodium and potassium, and this inhibition can be abolished by adding sodium but not by adding potassium. In solutions containing both sodium and potassium, isoproterenol stimulates potassium outflux, and this stimulation increases progressively with increasing extracellular sodium or potassium. Isoproterenol-stimulated sodium outflux is not influenced by extracellular sodium or potassium. Isoproterenol-stimulated cellular cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) is reduced slightly (25%) by removing extracellular sodium and potassium from the incubation solution, but this effect is not of sufficient magnitude to account for the effects of these cations on isoproterenol-stimulated cation transport. Ouabain does not alter the effect of extracellular sodium or potassium on isoproterenol-stimulated potassium influx; however, the glycoside potentiates (by 20 to 40%) the effects of these two cations on isoproterenol-stimulated sodium influx. Ouabain does not alter potassium outflux when the incubation solution contains both sodium and potassium; however, ouabain stimulates potassium outflux in an incubation solution free of sodium or potassium."
https://openalex.org/W1519804563,"L-Azetidine-2-carboxylic acid is the naturally occurring lower homologue of L-proline. Reticulocytes from anemic rabbits incubated with DL-[14-C]azetidine-2-carboxylic acid synthesized radiolabeled hemoglobin, which when isolated from cell lysates co-chromatographed with unlabeled hemoglobin on Sephadex G-100 columns. Amino acid analysis of hemoglobin from reticulocytes incubated with DL-[14-C]-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid suggested that the homologue was incorporated into hemoglobin intact and unaltered. Alternatively, another amino acid analogue, 1-aminocyclopentane-[1-14-C]carboxylic acid, which is purported to be a valine antagonist, was not incorporated into hemoglobin under these conditions. Incubation of reticulocytes with 1, 5, and 10 mM L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid reduced L-[U-14-C]proline (0.10 mM) incorporation into hemoglobin by 25, 58, and 72%, respectively. Conversely, 1.45 and 145 muM L-proline reduced radiolabeled azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (0.8 mM) in corporation into hemoglobin by 45 and 92%, respectively. Incorporation of L-[U-14-C]leucine and L-[U-14-C]lysine (0.1 mM each) into hemoglobin was unaffected at these concentrations of L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid. These results suggest that L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid is incorporated into hemoglobin without reducing the rate of globin synthesis in rabbit reticulocytes in vitro. The alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin into which [14-C]azetidine-2-carboxylic acid had been incorporated in rabbit reticulocytes in vitro were resolved electrophoretically on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The ratio of total radioactivity in the alpha and beta chains separately extracted from gels was in good agreement with the known 7:4 ratio of prolyl residues in the respective chains. Autoradiograms of two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of rabbit globin into which either [14-C]azetidine-2-carboxylic acid or [14-C]proline had been incorporated showed nearly identical patterns of radioactivity. These results suggest that azetidine-2-carboxylic acid substitutes specifically for prolyl residues during in vitro hemoglobin synthesis in rabbit reticulocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1483383153,"Protein synthesis was studied in slices from rat cerebral cortex and localized in various purified subcellular membrane fractions isolated after incubation with L-leucine. A synaptosomal fraction isolated from a several times washed crude mitochondrial pellet showed very little contamination by free membranes, and the synaptic membrane fraction isolated from it was estimated to c +ain about 50% of this component. Leucine incorporation into all fractions was highly sensitive (greater than 95%) to emetine except for the cell and synaptic mitochondrial subfractions. They were only 60 to 70% inhibited by emetine and showed 10 to 20% inhibition by chloramphenicol which probably was due to those proteins synthesized in situ by the mitochondria. The net rate of incorporation of labeled protein into the synaptosomal and synaptic membrane subfractions was low, and axonal flow was excluded as a significant source of this label. On the basis of autoradiography it was concluded that the majority of the protein label was contributed by free and membrane-enclosed ribosome-containing contaminants in these fractions. Unlabeled and labeled subcellular fractions were also analyzed by electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The staining profiles of the microsomal and synaptic membrane subfractions were nearly identical, whereas those of synaptic mitochondria and the soluble proteins of the cell bodies were unique. The labeling of all proteins was blocked by emetine, except for the synaptic mitochondria (cell mitochondria were not examined). These products of mitochondrial protein synthesis exhibited three labeling peaks, the major one with a molecular weight of approximately 38,000. In the absence of emetine, slices incorporated amino acids into soluble and microsomal proteins with high specific activity. The labeled proteins of the soluble fraction were more highly concentrated in the range of molecular weights smaller than 50,000 than were those in the microsomal fraction, and it was concluded that a considerable portion of the protein-synthesizing machinery of the brain is geared to form soluble proteins. The gel patterns of labeled microsomal and synaptic membranes were consistent with contamination by the former contributing most of the protein label in the latter."

https://openalex.org/W1544366346,"Carboxymethylation by iodoacetate of dihydrofolate reductase from the amethopterin-resistant mutant Streptococcus faecium var. Durans strain A leads to a loss of enzymic activity. Amino acid analysis showed that methionine is the only amino acid residue significantly affected by iodoacetate under the experimental conditions, and this was confirmed by the use of [1-14-C]iodoacetate and ion exchange chromatography of the products obtained by acid hydrolysis of the modified enzyme. During loss of 90% of the activity a total of about 2 of the 7 methionine residues present in the enzymes are carboxymethylated. Over this range of activity loss the decrease is proportional to the number of methionine residues modified. Fluorescence-quenching experiments demonstrated that dissociation constants for complexes of inhibitors with the carboxymethylated enzyme were 20 to 30 times greater than dissociation constants for corresponding complexes with native enzyme. Similarly, equilibrium dialysis studies showed that dihydrofolate binding to the modified enzyme was decreased 10-fold compared with binding to the native enzyme. These data suggest that iodoacetate modifies one or more methionine residues at the binding site for dihydrofolate and inhibitors. In accordance with this view it was shown that enzyme can be protected from inactivation by the folate analogue aminopterin and to a lesser extent by folate and dehydrofolate. Enzyme carboxymethylated in the presence of aminopterin, and subsequently freed of the latter, was found to bind inhibitors and dihydrofolate as tightly as the native enzyme. It is concluded that the loss of enzyme activity is caused by carboxymethylation of at least 1 methionine residue which is at or near the binding site of dihydrofolate."
https://openalex.org/W1599992651,"Iodine incorporation into thyroglobulin is known to occur within the lumen of the thyroid follicle. Since incorporation of sialic acid, which occupies a terminal position in the oligosaccharide chains, is also a later event in thyroglobulin synthesis, the possibility that sialic acid might be incorporated after thyroglobulin secretion was investigated. In one experimental approach normal rat thyroid hemilobes were incubated with radioactive precursors. Thyroglobulin, analyzed by equilibrium centrifugation in RbCl, had a median density which varied according to the moiety labeled in the following increasing order: leucine smaller than galactose smaller than sialic acid smaller than iodine. The molecules having the highest density were labeled only with iodine. In the second approach, thyroid hemilobes were taken from rats treated with cycloheximide for 16 hours to stop protein synthesis and allow nascent molecules to be secreted, and incorporation of precursors into thyroglobulin was analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Leucine incorporation was 6% of control but the amino acid was found in the NH2-terminal position. N-Acetylmannosamine (sialic acid precursor) and galactose incorporation were also completely inhibited whereas iodine incorporation was 10% of control. Incorporation was not restored by thyrotropin treatment, and the sialyltransferase and iodination systems were reduced only to 50 to 70% of control. The results indicate that sialic acid is incorporated only in nascent thyroglobulin and not in thyroglobulin molecules already secreted into the follicular lumen. A large fraction of the iodine incorporation also seems to occur in newly synthesized thyroglobulin."
https://openalex.org/W1540184643,"Phage Qbeta replicase is composed of four subunits of molecular weights 70,000, 65,000, 45,000, and 35,000. Treatment of the enzyme with protein cross-linking reagents results in formation of three covalently bound complexes of molecular weights 215,000, 135,000, and 80,000. Analysis of the two larger complexes formed by cross-linking with a reversible cross-linker (methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate) demonstrates that the 215,000 molecular weight complex is composed of one each of the replicase subunits, while the 135,000 molecular weight complex is composed of the two larger subunits. The 80,000 molecular weight complex was shown to be made up of the two smaller subunits by cross-linking these two subunits in the absence of the larger pair. Increasing ionic strength stabilizes the large complex at the expense of the two smaller complexes. The presence of stoichiometric amounts of Qbeta RNA during cross-linking dramatically reduces formation of the large complex; other natural and synthetic RNAs reduce the formation of this complex to a lesser extent."
https://openalex.org/W1584274804,"The proteins of several subsets of ribosomal subunits isolated from HeLa cells were separated by high resolution electrophoresis in polyacrylamide slab gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. Comparisons were made among native subunits, and subunits derived from single ribosomes, free polysomes, and membrane-bound polysomes. At least 10 heterogeneously distributed proteins were identified among the 40 S subunit proteins, compared wtih 17 to 20 proteins that occurred in all 40 S subunit classes. All 60 S subunits shared 34 separable proteins. One protein was missing only from membrane-bound 60 S subunits and another protein was present only in membrane-bound 60 S subunits. It is suggested that these two proteins regulate the binding of 60 S subunits to the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1501893316,"Abstract Glucose utilization, biosynthesis of fructose and citrate, and certain aspects of energy metabolism were studied in a homogeneous preparation of mating guinea pig seminal vesicle epithelium. Under aerobic conditions, ATP:ADP ratios between 6 and 7 were maintained attesting to the viability and metabolic integrity of the preparation. There were multiple differences between seminal vesicle epithelium and smooth muscle on comparison of concentrations of 19 different metabolites including the adenine nucleotides. In seminal vesicle, glycolysis was rapid under anaerobic conditions (approximately 25 mumol times g-1 times hour-1 during the first 3 min) and also occurred under aerobic conditions (approimately 5 mumol times g-1 times hour-1). Anaerobically, the concentration of fructose diphosphate increased 2-fold and that of fructose 6-phosphate decreased to one-third of control values, consistent with regulation at the level of phosphofructokinase. ATP and total adenine nucleotides decreased rapidly and, by 3 min, had attained steady state values of about one-third and one-half of control values, respectively. Under aerobic conditions, the rate of fructogenesis increased with increasing concentrations of added glucose, reaching maximum (3 mumol times g-1 times hour-1) at 8 to 10 mM glucose and half-maximum at 2 mM glucose. Simultaneously, sorbitol synthesis occurred at rates that were similarly influenced by the concentrations of added glucose. The highest rate of fructogenesis (6.5 mumol times g-1 times hour-1) occurred during aerobic incubation immediately after a period of anaerobic incubation: exogenous substrate was not required. This could be prevented by addition of D-glyceraldehyde which was converted to glycerol stoichiometrically because of its preferential (versus glucose) reduction by aldose reductase. Our data are consistent with the sorbitol pathway of Hers as the major route of fructose biosynthesis. The rate of citrate syntehsis increased with increasing concentrations of added pyruvate. The maximum rate (3.4 mumol times g-1 times hour-1) was achieved with 2 mM pyruvate. Added glucose failed to support citrate synthesis to the same extent as did added pyruvate. The highest rate of citrate synthesis (8.0 mumol times g-1 times hour-1) occurred simultaneously with the highest rate of fructogenesis (after the anaerobic-aerobic transition). Exogenous substrate was not required."
