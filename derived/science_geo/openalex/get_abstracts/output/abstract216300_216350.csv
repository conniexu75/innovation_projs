Also required are a heat-stable factor in the particulate fraction, molecular oxygen, and bile salts. The reaction is stimulated by glutathione. The product, obtained in yields of up to 50 percent, has been identified as vitamin A aldehyde (retinal) by way of its semicarbazone derivative. The reaction mechanism involves the central cleavage of beta-carotene into two molecules of retinal."

Heparin which had been prepared by use of mild methods essentially based on treat- ment with proteolytic enzymes, contained residual amino acids with serine as the main component. In some preparations serine was the only amino acid found in significant amounts. Samples prepared under more drastic conditions, including alkali extrac- tion and bleaching at elevated temperatures, contained only traces of amino acids. It is suggested that heparin occurs in the native state as a complex with protein and that the carbohydrate- protein linkage is similar to that of the chondroitin 4-sulfate- protein complex. dcknowledgments-We are indebted to Professor E. Jorpes, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Mr. G. Linden, the Vitrum AB, Dr. H. H. R. Weber, and Dr. C. DeFiebre, Wilson Labora- tories, and to Dr. L. L. Coleman, the Upjohn Company, for providing the heparin samples. We are also grateful to the Vitrum AB and the Wilson Laboratories for the anticoagulant activity assays. We are grateful to Dr. A. Dorfman for stimulat- ing discussions and continued support throughout this work. We wish to thank Dr. M. B. Mathews for the molecular weight determinations and Miss M. L. Spach for skillful technical assist- ance."

https://openalex.org/W1987478802,"When adult spawning salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, O. kisutch) arrive at the ""home"" pond, most regions of the brain are electrically inactive, but the olfactory bulbs and posterior cerebellum are relatively highly active. Infusion of various natural waters from nearby sources other than the home pond into the olfactory sac produces little or no change in spontaneous electroencephalographic patterns recorded from the olfactory bulbs. Water from the home pond, however, produces a vigorous response of high amplitude. These findings suggest that olfaction is an important factor in guidance during the final phases of homeward migration of salmon, and that olfactory discrimination occurs at the level of either the olfactory bulbs or the olfactory epithelium."

https://openalex.org/W2029616149,"The concept of an internal pressure gradient in a rigid porous membrane has been proposed as the basis for osmotic flow. The origin of the pressure in terms of the theory of the chemical potential implies also the existence of states of negative pressure, that is, tension. These states have been observed experimentally by means of a Hepp-type osmometer."
https://openalex.org/W2145854970,"Studies on the rate-limiting factors of glycolysis in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells have indicated that orthophosphate is the major rate-limiting factor for glycolysis (l-5). Pi presumably influences the rate of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the only glycolytic enzyme known to require Pi. However, recent reports have indicated that Pi may have other important effects on glycolytic systems. Thus, in cell-free systems, Passonneau and Lowry (6) as well as Mansour (7) showed that Pi may activate P-fructokinase by counteracting the inhibitory effect of high ATP concentrations. Rose, Warms, and O’Connell (8, 9) have reported that Pi may partially relieve the glucose-6-P inhibition of hexokinase in red blood cells. In the light of these observations intact ascites tumor cells were re-examined in order to define more precisely the site of action of Pi in the control of intracellular glycolysis. In addition, other factors which influence the rate of glycolysis, such as the availability of glucose, have been analyzed. The data to be reported in this communication revealed that the availability of glucose restricted aerobic but not anaerobic glycolysis at glucose concentrations below 1.2 mM. The primary effect of Pi appeared to be mediated through its influence on P-fructokinase, although hexokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase were also affected. A preliminary report has appeared (10)."

The inhibition is reversible; upon transfer of a treated culture to a normal medium, mineralization proceeds normally but maldeveloped bones result."

https://openalex.org/W2043588680,"Enhanced transport of oxygen in a Millipore filter containing a solution of hemoglobin can be accounted for by the diffusion of free oxygen as well as of hemoglobin-bound oxygen. A model shows that, at oxygen tensions at which the hemoglobin is fully saturated in a portion of the membrane, the enhanced transport is due to a steeper gradient for free oxygen, whereas in the rest of the membrane an ""(oxy)hemoglobin shuttle"" operates. A similar model may be useful for explaining facilitated diffusion in other systems."

https://openalex.org/W2025202077,"Facilitated transport of oxygen through hemoglobin has been studied by use of a membrane sandwich of hemoglobin, Teflon, and water. Transport is enhanced only when there is a hemoglobin-bound-O2 gradient in the pigment. When passing through a fully oxygenated layer, the accelerated transport is carried by an increased diffusion gradient of oxygen pressure through the solvent. The results substantiate experimentally the diffusion gradients proposed by Zilversmit."

https://openalex.org/W2077442549,"In eight highly inducible strains of Staphylococcus aureus repression of the formation of penicillinase was temperature-sensitive under conditions suggesting direct thermal inactivation of the repressor. Restoration of repression required protein synthesis. These strains were resistant to benzylpenicillin and to many other antibiotics. One auxotrophic mutant had greatly reduced temperature sensitivity but was still normally inducible. Six strains were relatively poorly inducible, exhibited a proportionately smaller increase in enzyme after exposure to elevated temperature, and were sensitive to antibiotics other than benzylpenicillin. Temperature sensitivity may be a useful character in studies of the physiology and genetics of the repression of staphylococcal penicillinase."

https://openalex.org/W4240069320,"A COMPUTER programme has been written by one of us (D. B.) to simulate the effects of selection on a six-locus genetic system. This programme, which is termed GS-D-1, has been written in Fortran IV to allow its general use on any computer of 32 K capacity which can interpret this language, for example, IBM 7040, 709. Runs of this programme have been used to test Mather's (1943) contention that stabilizing selection will lead to the evolution of balanced polygenic combinations in which repulsion, linkages are maximized. He stated that under such selection “an equilibrium will exist between selective increase and recombinant decrease of favoured types, and selective decrease and recombinant increase of deleterious types”."

The considerations governing this investigation were given in detail. The accuracy of the standards was validated using certified National Bureau of Standards materials; serum magnesium concentration was then measured by two entirely different methods and the same values were obtained; finally, recovery of added standards by both methods approached 100 per cent."
