https://openalex.org/W2131036795,"Interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) belongs to a family of nine transcription factors that share a highly conserved helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and a less conserved protein-binding domain. Most IRFs regulate the expression of interferon-alpha and -beta after viral infection, but the function of IRF6 is unknown. The gene encoding IRF6 is located in the critical region for the Van der Woude syndrome (VWS; OMIM 119300) locus at chromosome 1q32-q41 (refs 2,3). The disorder is an autosomal dominant form of cleft lip and palate with lip pits, and is the most common syndromic form of cleft lip or palate. Popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS; OMIM 119500) is a disorder with a similar orofacial phenotype that also includes skin and genital anomalies. Phenotypic overlap and linkage data suggest that these two disorders are allelic. We found a nonsense mutation in IRF6 in the affected twin of a pair of monozygotic twins who were discordant for VWS. Subsequently, we identified mutations in IRF6 in 45 additional unrelated families affected with VWS and distinct mutations in 13 families affected with PPS. Expression analyses showed high levels of Irf6 mRNA along the medial edge of the fusing palate, tooth buds, hair follicles, genitalia and skin. Our observations demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of IRF6 disrupts orofacial development and are consistent with dominant-negative mutations disturbing development of the skin and genitalia."

Cell Biol. 152, 1079–1085) and hypothesized that the lipid droplet surface is a kind of membrane. To elucidate the characteristics of the lipid droplet surface, we isolated lipid droplets from HepG2 cells and analyzed them by cryoelectron microscopy and by mass spectrometry. By use of cryoelectron microscopy at the stage temperature of 4.2 K, the lipid droplet surface was observed as a single line without any fixation or staining, indicating the presence of a single layer of phospholipids. This result appeared consistent with the hypothesis that the lipid droplet surface is derived from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and may be continuous to it. However, mass spectrometry revealed that the fatty acid composition of phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine in lipid droplets is different from that of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The ample presence of free cholesterol in lipid droplets also suggests that their surface is differentiated from the bulk endoplasmic reticulum membrane. On the other hand, although caveolin-2β and adipose differentiation-related protein, both localizing in lipid droplets, were enriched in the low density floating fraction, the fatty acid composition of the fraction was distinct from lipid droplets. Collectively, the result indicates that the lipid droplet surface is a hemi-membrane or a phospholipid monolayer containing cholesterol but is compositionally different from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane or the sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich microdomain. We found that caveolin-2 is targeted to the surface of lipid droplets (Fujimoto, T., Kogo, H., Ishiguro, K., Tauchi, K., and Nomura, R. (2001) J.

Collectively, the result indicates that the lipid droplet surface is a hemi-membrane or a phospholipid monolayer containing cholesterol but is compositionally different from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane or the sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich microdomain. Lipid droplets have been regarded as a depot of neutral lipids. They exist most abundantly in adipose cells and steroid-producing cells but can be found in virtually any kind of cell. The core of lipid droplets is occupied by triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester in various ratios depending on the cell type (1Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), but information on the lipid droplet surface has been scarce. Recently we as well as others showed that caveolins can exist in the lipid droplet surface (2Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 3Ostermeyer A.G. Paci J.M. Zeng Y. Lublin D.M. Munro S. Brown D.A. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Caveolins, i.e. caveolin-1, 2, 3, are membrane proteins that are incorporated to the sphingolipid/cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomain and form the framework of caveolae (5Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lipid droplets were reported to contain other microdomain proteins,i.e. Lyn and mitogen-activated protein kinase, as well as abundant free cholesterol (6Yu W. Bozza P.T. Tzizik D.M.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2977-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the lipid droplet surface is a kind of membrane and that it might have some similarity to the microdomain.However, electron microscopy of conventional resin-embedded ultrathin sections cannot visualize any membranous structure around the lipid droplet. In the ultrathin section of specimens fixed by aldehydes and then by osmium tetroxide, the lipid droplet content appears vacant, and its periphery is usually seen as a thin intermittent line. In many diagrams, the lipid droplet surface has been depicted as a phospholipid monolayer with the hydrophilic headgroup facing the cytoplasm and the hydrophobic acyl chains extending into the lipid droplet content (9Murphy D.J. Vance J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar,10Brown D.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R446-R449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It has also been assumed that lipid droplets form by accumulation of neutral lipids between the two leaflets of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ADRP, adipose differentiation-related protein; Cap-LC/ESI, capillary liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization; PC, phosphatidylcholine; TIFF, Triton X-100-insoluble floating fraction 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ADRP, adipose differentiation-related protein; Cap-LC/ESI, capillary liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization; PC, phosphatidylcholine; TIFF, Triton X-100-insoluble floating fractionmembrane. However, evidence to support the above assumptions is scarce. Only freeze-fracture electron microscopy showed that the fracture plane along the lipid droplet surface is occasionally continuous with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER membrane (11Blanchette Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226PubMed Google Scholar, 12Peixoto de Menezes A. Pinto da Silva P. Lab. Invest. 1979; 40: 545-553PubMed Google Scholar).We wanted to examine whether the lipid droplet surface is really a phospholipid monolayer. Because it is difficult to retain lipid-rich structures by conventional morphological methods, we took advantage of cryoelectron microscopy that can observe biological specimens at the atomic resolution without fixation or staining (13Fujiyoshi Y. Mizusaki T. Morikawa K. Yamagishi H. Aoki Y. Kihara H. Harada Y. Ultramicroscopy. 1991; 38: 241-251Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to gain information about the lipid droplet phospholipids, we analyzed the fatty acid composition of phospholipids by mass spectrometry. The microscopy showed that the lipid droplet surface is indeed a hemi-membrane, or a phospholipid monolayer, and mass spectrometry revealed that the fatty acid composition of the lipid droplet phospholipids is distinct from that of rough ER and cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich microdomain. The result not only questions the current hypothesis on the mechanism of lipid droplet formation but also provides a firm basis for further studies on the physiological function of lipid droplets.DISCUSSIONThe surface of lipid droplets has been speculated to be a phospholipid monolayer because hydrophobic lipid esters may exist stably in the aqueous cytoplasm only when covered with amphiphilic molecules with hydrophilic moiety facing outward. Yet most likely, the only experimental result that supports the speculation has been a few freeze-fracture pictures showing the continuity of a putative ER membrane leaflet and the lipid droplet surface (11Blanchette Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226PubMed Google Scholar, 12Peixoto de Menezes A. Pinto da Silva P. Lab. Invest. 1979; 40: 545-553PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we employed a cryoelectron microscope, which is able to visualize biological specimens with minimal damage and has been used extensively to decipher three-dimensional molecular structures at atomic resolution (e.g. Ref. 32Sato C. Ueno Y. Asai K. Takahashi K. Sato M. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2001; 409: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The cryoelectron microscopy has shown previously that the envelope of the influenza A virus is a phospholipid monolayer underlain with a protein layer (33Fujiyoshi Y. Kume N.P. Sakata K. Sato S.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By this technique, a single electron-dense line representing a row of phosphorus atoms was observed in the surface of isolated lipid droplets. It contrasts with two parallel lines seen in the liposomal membrane (27Tahara Y. Fujiyoshi Y. Micron. 1994; 25: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which is a phospholipid bilayer, and thus proves for the first time that the lipid droplet surface is a phospholipid monolayer.The presence of a phospholipid monolayer in the surface is consistent with the current model that lipid droplets are formed by lipid ester deposition between the two leaflets of the ER membrane and may remain connected to it (9Murphy D.J. Vance J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 10Brown D.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R446-R449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Distribution of acetyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1, a major enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol ester, in the entire ER (Ref. 34Chang C.C. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and data not shown) seems to indicate that lipid droplets may bud anywhere along the membrane. However, Cap-LC/ESI mass spectrometry showed that fatty acid moieties of PC and lyso-PC in lipid droplets are distinct from those in rough microsome, which is thought to be equivalent to the rough ER. The result does not deny the possibility that the lipid droplet surface is generated from the ER membrane but indicates that the former is a highly differentiated domain. Mature lipid droplets may possibly exist as a structure independent of the ER; alternatively, the lipid droplet may be connected to the ER, but some molecular mechanism may demarcate the lipid droplet surface from the bulk ER membrane as postulated for other ER domains (35Stone S.J. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34534-34540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Whichever possibility is the case, we suppose that esters synthesized in wide areas of the ER do not deposit indiscriminately but are concentrated to loci specialized to make lipid droplets. ADRP or other lipid droplet-associated proteins may be involved in the process.A peculiar feature of lipid droplets revealed by Cap-LC/ESI mass spectrometry is the abundance of unsaturated fatty acids in lyso-PC. How and where the unique lyso-PC was generated is not known, but phospholipase A2, reported to exist in lipid droplets of leukocytes (6Yu W. Bozza P.T. Tzizik D.M. Gray J.P. Cassara J. Dvorak A.M. Weller P.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 759-769PubMed Google Scholar), may be involved. If so, lyso-PC in lipid droplets is derived from a rather rare population of PC with an unsaturated acyl chain in position 1. The relative abundance of PC with two mono-unsaturated acyl chains (i.e. 18:1–18:1 and 16:1–18:1) in lipid droplets (Fig.4 B) is in line with the speculation. The origin of the rare PC species is also unknown. They may be synthesized in the ER and sequestered to lipid droplets; interaction with neutral lipids might be involved in the accumulation of unsaturated acyl chains. However, it is also possible that the unique species were newly formed in lipid droplets; in this case, the continuous turnover of lipid esters and the resultant release and incorporation of fatty acids are thought to be closely related to the surface composition.Major contamination in the lipid droplet fraction is excluded by the absence of marker enzymes of other organelles (2Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), but a possibility of minor contamination by phospholipids may need to be considered. However, using the same cell homogenate as a starting material, PCs with two mono-unsaturated acyl chains are found abundantly only in the lipid droplet and far less so in the microsome or TIFF. Furthermore, using the Cap-LC/ESI mass spectrometric technique, PC obtained from several cell and membrane preparations did not show the characteristics found with the lipid droplet. 2R. Taguchi, unpublished data. These results make it unlikely that the PCs found in the lipid droplet occur densely in a soluble phase and adhere to any existing membrane promiscuously.In previous studies, sequestration of caveolins to lipid droplets was found to be induced or increased dramatically when cells were treated with brefeldin A (2Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 3Ostermeyer A.G. Paci J.M. Zeng Y. Lublin D.M. Munro S. Brown D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The result was interpreted to indicate that caveolins first concentrated in the ER membrane and then moved to the lipid droplet by lateral diffusion through the membrane continuity. However, two questions were raised concerning this interpretation: one was why caveolins could be concentrated markedly in lipid droplets and the other was why caveolins sequestered to lipid droplets were not chased out even after brefeldin A was discontinued. The latter question may be answered readily by assuming that the lipid droplet surface is not continuous to the ER membrane. Yet then, the former question can be answered only by supposing a specific transport mechanism because brefeldin A-induced concentration of caveolins appears to occur even in pre-existing lipid droplets. Interestingly, a recent study showed that newly synthesized cholesterol esters are incorporated to pre-existing droplets containing triglycerides (36Kellner-Weibel G. McHendry-Rinde B. Haynes M.P. Adelman S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 768-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is plausible that lipid esters, possibly along with phospholipids, may be transported from the ER to lipid droplets by an unknown mechanism, and caveolins might exploit the machinery under some circumstances.Cap-LC/ESI mass spectrometry also showed that the lipid droplet surface is different from the sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich microdomain in the fatty acid composition. Interestingly, TIFF contained a higher proportion of long saturated fatty acids than rough microsome, whereas lipid droplet did not. The result indicates that not only interaction between sphingolipid and cholesterol but also interaction between saturated phospholipid and cholesterol are important in forming the microdomain, as predicted from model membrane studies (37Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Based on the finding of caveolin sequestration, we speculated previously that the lipid droplet surface might have a property similar to the microdomain (2Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, the present result does not support the supposition in terms of the fatty acid composition. Furthermore, TLC showed that the relative amount of sphingomyelin and free cholesterol in comparison with PC is far less in lipid droplets than in TIFF (data not shown). Thus lipid composition does not appear to be the cause of caveolin sequestration to lipid droplets. As far as HepG2 cells are concerned, caveolin-2β was found almost exclusively around lipid droplets, but caveolin-2α was mostly found in the Golgi and only minimally in lipid droplets; furthermore, caveolin-1 was not recruited to lipid droplets unless treated with brefeldin A (2Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The differential behavior of caveolins may provide a clue to elucidate the mechanism of transport to lipid droplets.TIFF obtained by the 1% Triton X-100 method has been thought as thein vitro correlate of the sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich microdomain (38Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). We found that caveolin-2β in the lipid droplet was completely solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in the cold but floated to low density fractions when 500 mm sodium carbonate or 0.025% Triton X-100 was used in cell homogenization. The low density fractions obtained by the sodium carbonate protocol were reported to be enriched with the same molecules as TIFF (16Song K.S., Li Shengwen Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). However, whether the two preparations really represent the same membrane domain has not been rigorously tested. On the other hand, the fractions collected by the 0.025% Triton X-100 method were presumed to contain molecules with less affinity to the sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich microdomain (15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The present result showed that although the lipid composition is distinct, molecules in the lipid droplet surface are enriched in the same fraction as the sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich microdomain. It awaits further studies to determine whether the result indicates some similarity in the property of the two domains or simply indicates that the low density fractions obtained by the sodium carbonate and 0.025% Triton X-100 protocols could contain non-microdomain constituents.In summary, the present study showed that the lipid droplet surface is a phospholipid monolayer with a unique fatty acid composition. Lipid droplets had been regarded as a simple reservoir of neutral lipids and as rather an inert structure. However, in view of recent findings indicating accumulation of proteins related to various diseases (39Cole N.B. Murphy D.D. Grider T. Rueter S. Brasaemle D. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6344-6352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar,40Shi S.T. Polyak S.J., Tu, H. Taylor D.R. Gretch D.R. Lai M.M. Virology. 2002; 292: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), it is imperative to study how lipid droplets are formed, modified, and regulated. The properties revealed here should give a firm basis for the forthcoming studies. Lipid droplets have been regarded as a depot of neutral lipids. They exist most abundantly in adipose cells and steroid-producing cells but can be found in virtually any kind of cell. The core of lipid droplets is occupied by triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester in various ratios depending on the cell type (1Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys.

Whichever possibility is the case, we suppose that esters synthesized in wide areas of the ER do not deposit indiscriminately but are concentrated to loci specialized to make lipid droplets. ADRP or other lipid droplet-associated proteins may be involved in the process.A peculiar feature of lipid droplets revealed by Cap-LC/ESI mass spectrometry is the abundance of unsaturated fatty acids in lyso-PC. How and where the unique lyso-PC was generated is not known, but phospholipase A2, reported to exist in lipid droplets of leukocytes (6Yu W. Bozza P.T. Tzizik D.M. Gray J.P. Cassara J. Dvorak A.M. Weller P.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 759-769PubMed Google Scholar), may be involved. If so, lyso-PC in lipid droplets is derived from a rather rare population of PC with an unsaturated acyl chain in position 1. The relative abundance of PC with two mono-unsaturated acyl chains (i.e. 18:1–18:1 and 16:1–18:1) in lipid droplets (Fig.4 B) is in line with the speculation. The origin of the rare PC species is also unknown. They may be synthesized in the ER and sequestered to lipid droplets; interaction with neutral lipids might be involved in the accumulation of unsaturated acyl chains. However, it is also possible that the unique species were newly formed in lipid droplets; in this case, the continuous turnover of lipid esters and the resultant release and incorporation of fatty acids are thought to be closely related to the surface composition.Major contamination in the lipid droplet fraction is excluded by the absence of marker enzymes of other organelles (2Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), but a possibility of minor contamination by phospholipids may need to be considered. However, using the same cell homogenate as a starting material, PCs with two mono-unsaturated acyl chains are found abundantly only in the lipid droplet and far less so in the microsome or TIFF. Furthermore, using the Cap-LC/ESI mass spectrometric technique, PC obtained from several cell and membrane preparations did not show the characteristics found with the lipid droplet. 2R. Taguchi, unpublished data. These results make it unlikely that the PCs found in the lipid droplet occur densely in a soluble phase and adhere to any existing membrane promiscuously.In previous studies, sequestration of caveolins to lipid droplets was found to be induced or increased dramatically when cells were treated with brefeldin A (2Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 3Ostermeyer A.G. Paci J.M. Zeng Y. Lublin D.M. Munro S. Brown D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The result was interpreted to indicate that caveolins first concentrated in the ER membrane and then moved to the lipid droplet by lateral diffusion through the membrane continuity. However, two questions were raised concerning this interpretation: one was why caveolins could be concentrated markedly in lipid droplets and the other was why caveolins sequestered to lipid droplets were not chased out even after brefeldin A was discontinued. The latter question may be answered readily by assuming that the lipid droplet surface is not continuous to the ER membrane. Yet then, the former question can be answered only by supposing a specific transport mechanism because brefeldin A-induced concentration of caveolins appears to occur even in pre-existing lipid droplets. Interestingly, a recent study showed that newly synthesized cholesterol esters are incorporated to pre-existing droplets containing triglycerides (36Kellner-Weibel G. McHendry-Rinde B. Haynes M.P. Adelman S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 768-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is plausible that lipid esters, possibly along with phospholipids, may be transported from the ER to lipid droplets by an unknown mechanism, and caveolins might exploit the machinery under some circumstances.Cap-LC/ESI mass spectrometry also showed that the lipid droplet surface is different from the sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich microdomain in the fatty acid composition. Interestingly, TIFF contained a higher proportion of long saturated fatty acids than rough microsome, whereas lipid droplet did not. The result indicates that not only interaction between sphingolipid and cholesterol but also interaction between saturated phospholipid and cholesterol are important in forming the microdomain, as predicted from model membrane studies (37Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Based on the finding of caveolin sequestration, we speculated previously that the lipid droplet surface might have a property similar to the microdomain (2Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, the present result does not support the supposition in terms of the fatty acid composition. Furthermore, TLC showed that the relative amount of sphingomyelin and free cholesterol in comparison with PC is far less in lipid droplets than in TIFF (data not shown). Thus lipid composition does not appear to be the cause of caveolin sequestration to lipid droplets. As far as HepG2 cells are concerned, caveolin-2β was found almost exclusively around lipid droplets, but caveolin-2α was mostly found in the Golgi and only minimally in lipid droplets; furthermore, caveolin-1 was not recruited to lipid droplets unless treated with brefeldin A (2Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The differential behavior of caveolins may provide a clue to elucidate the mechanism of transport to lipid droplets.TIFF obtained by the 1% Triton X-100 method has been thought as thein vitro correlate of the sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich microdomain (38Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). We found that caveolin-2β in the lipid droplet was completely solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in the cold but floated to low density fractions when 500 mm sodium carbonate or 0.025% Triton X-100 was used in cell homogenization. The low density fractions obtained by the sodium carbonate protocol were reported to be enriched with the same molecules as TIFF (16Song K.S., Li Shengwen Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). However, whether the two preparations really represent the same membrane domain has not been rigorously tested. On the other hand, the fractions collected by the 0.025% Triton X-100 method were presumed to contain molecules with less affinity to the sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich microdomain (15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The present result showed that although the lipid composition is distinct, molecules in the lipid droplet surface are enriched in the same fraction as the sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich microdomain. It awaits further studies to determine whether the result indicates some similarity in the property of the two domains or simply indicates that the low density fractions obtained by the sodium carbonate and 0.025% Triton X-100 protocols could contain non-microdomain constituents.In summary, the present study showed that the lipid droplet surface is a phospholipid monolayer with a unique fatty acid composition. Lipid droplets had been regarded as a simple reservoir of neutral lipids and as rather an inert structure. However, in view of recent findings indicating accumulation of proteins related to various diseases (39Cole N.B. Murphy D.D. Grider T. Rueter S. Brasaemle D. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6344-6352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar,40Shi S.T. Polyak S.J., Tu, H. Taylor D.R. Gretch D.R. Lai M.M. Virology. 2002; 292: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), it is imperative to study how lipid droplets are formed, modified, and regulated. The properties revealed here should give a firm basis for the forthcoming studies. The surface of lipid droplets has been speculated to be a phospholipid monolayer because hydrophobic lipid esters may exist stably in the aqueous cytoplasm only when covered with amphiphilic molecules with hydrophilic moiety facing outward. Yet most likely, the only experimental result that supports the speculation has been a few freeze-fracture pictures showing the continuity of a putative ER membrane leaflet and the lipid droplet surface (11Blanchette Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226PubMed Google Scholar, 12Peixoto de Menezes A. Pinto da Silva P. Lab. Invest. 1979; 40: 545-553PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we employed a cryoelectron microscope, which is able to visualize biological specimens with minimal damage and has been used extensively to decipher three-dimensional molecular structures at atomic resolution (e.g. Ref. 32Sato C. Ueno Y. Asai K. Takahashi K. Sato M. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2001; 409: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The cryoelectron microscopy has shown previously that the envelope of the influenza A virus is a phospholipid monolayer underlain with a protein layer (33Fujiyoshi Y. Kume N.P. Sakata K. Sato S.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By this technique, a single electron-dense line representing a row of phosphorus atoms was observed in the surface of isolated lipid droplets. It contrasts with two parallel lines seen in the liposomal membrane (27Tahara Y. Fujiyoshi Y. Micron. 1994; 25: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which is a phospholipid bilayer, and thus proves for the first time that the lipid droplet surface is a phospholipid monolayer. The presence of a phospholipid monolayer in the surface is consistent with the current model that lipid droplets are formed by lipid ester deposition between the two leaflets of the ER membrane and may remain connected to it (9Murphy D.J. Vance J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 10Brown D.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R446-R449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Distribution of acetyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1, a major enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol ester, in the entire ER (Ref. 34Chang C.C. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and data not shown) seems to indicate that lipid droplets may bud anywhere along the membrane. However, Cap-LC/ESI mass spectrometry showed that fatty acid moieties of PC and lyso-PC in lipid droplets are distinct from those in rough microsome, which is thought to be equivalent to the rough ER. The result does not deny the possibility that the lipid droplet surface is generated from the ER membrane but indicates that the former is a highly differentiated domain. Mature lipid droplets may possibly exist as a structure independent of the ER; alternatively, the lipid droplet may be connected to the ER, but some molecular mechanism may demarcate the lipid droplet surface from the bulk ER membrane as postulated for other ER domains (35Stone S.J. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34534-34540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).

(2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 37407–37413) and that CS-E exhibits neurite outgrowth promoting activities toward embryonic rat hippocampal neurons. We have also shown oversulfated CS chains in embryonic chick and rat brains and demonstrated that the CS disaccharide composition changes during brain development. In view of these findings, here we tested the possibility of CS-E interacting with Hep-binding growth factors during development, using squid cartilage CS-E. The binding ability of Hep-binding growth factors (MK, pleiotrophin (PTN), fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1), FGF-2, Hep-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), FGF-10, FGF-16, and FGF-18) toward [3H]CS-E was first tested by a filter binding assay, which demonstrated direct binding of all growth factors, except FGF-1, to CS-E. The bindings were characterized further in an Interaction Analysis system, where all of the growth factors, except FGF-1, gave concentration-dependent and specific bindings. The kinetic constants ka, kd, andKd suggested that MK, PTN, FGF-16, FGF-18, and HB-EGF bound strongly to CS-E, in comparable degrees to the binding to Hep, whereas the intensity of binding of FGF-2 and FGF-10 toward CS-E was lower than that for Hep. These findings suggest the possibility of CS-E being a binding partner, a coreceptor, or a genuine receptor for various Hep-binding growth factors in the brain and possibly also in other tissues.

Recently, we demonstrated that the neuronal cell adhesion, mediated by the heparin (Hep)-binding growth factor midkine (MK), was specifically inhibited not only by Hep but also by squid cartilage oversulfated CS-E (14Ueoka C.

Despite a large number of CS-PGs identified in the mammalian brain, CS chains attached to individual core proteins have not been structurally characterized, and the specificity of the molecular interactions of the brain CS chains with these growth factors has been largely unknown. However, we found recently that appican, the PG form of amyloid precursor protein, which is a neurotrophic factor (31Salinero O. Moreno-Flores M.T. Wandosell F. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), contained a significant proportion (14.3%) of E unit (32Tsuchida K. Shioi J. Yamada S. Boghosian G., Wu, A. Cai H. Sugahara K.

In view of the findings that MK and PTN are expressed in the brain during embryonic development and the demonstration of oversulfated CS structures, with binding capacities to these Hep-binding growth factors in embryonic brains, we hypothesized that these oversulfated structures might also interact with other Hep-binding growth factors in the brain during embryonic development. This hypothesis was explored in the present study using oversulfated CS-E in particular and various Hep-binding growth factors. The results suggest that all of the tested growth factors can indeed bind CS-E, and kinetic studies show that some of these bindings are stronger than those toward Hep. The preliminary findings have been reported in abstract form (33Deepa, S.

Varying amounts (150–450 ng) of individual growth factors were incubated with [3H]CS-E (82 ng, ∼12,000 cpm), or a fixed amount (300 ng) of individual growth factors was incubated with [3H]Hep (80 ng, ∼22,800 cpm) in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 130 mm NaCl and 1 mg/ml BSA at room temperature for 3 h. Mixed cellulose ester filters (0.45-μm or 1.0-μm pore size, 25-mm diameter; ADVANTEC, Tokyo) were placed onto a 12-well vacuum-assisted manifold filtration apparatus and washed with 10 ml of the same buffer devoid of BSA. The growth factor along with any bound [3H]CS-E/Hep was recovered by the quick passage of the samples through the filters, and the unbound samples were eluted by washing five times with 2 ml of the same buffer. Protein-bound radioactivity was determined after immersing the filters in 1 ml of 1m NaCl and 0.05 m diethylamine, pH 11.5, for 30 min and the radioactivity in the eluate was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (LSC-700, Aloka Co., Tokyo) using scintillation fluid containing 1.2% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 33% (w/v) Triton X-100. Hep or CS-E was dissolved in 100 mm MES, pH 5.5, at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. The solution was mixed with a 50 mm solution of freshly prepared biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce) in dimethyl sulfoxide. The weight ratio of Hep or CS-E to biotin-LC-hydrazide was 20:1. EDAC hydrochloride, dissolved in the same buffer, was added to this mixture. The weight ratio of Hep or CS-E to EDAC hydrochloride was 8:1. The labeling reaction occurred overnight at room temperature by gently mixing the solution. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against PBS at room temperature for 24 h. Dialysis was carried out in a Spectra/Por molecular porous membrane tubing, with a molecular mass cutoff of 3,500 Da (Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Laguna Hills, CA). Hexuronic acid in each preparation was quantified by the carbazole method, using GlcUA as standard (38Bitter M. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar). The mol of biotin/mol of CS-E or Hep was determined by the modified protocol of Green (39Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 23c-24cCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), which uses HABA dye and avidin, which form a complex. In brief, 60 μl of 10 mm HABA in 10 mm NaOH was added to 1.94 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, containing 1 mg of avidin. The absorbance of this solution at 500 nm was recorded. A solution (10 μl each) of biotinylated CS-E (1.7 mg/ml) or Hep (2.1 mg/ml) was added to 90 μl of the above reagent. A decrease in absorbance, as biotin replaced HABA, was recorded. About 4.2% of the hexuronic acid groups in CS-E were derivatized with the biotin tag. The extent of biotinylation for Hep cannot be determined because addition of Hep produced a precipitate (40Foxall C. Holme K.R. Liang W. Wei Z. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, a comparable degree of biotinylation with CS-E is expected for Hep. Successful biotinylation of Hep or CS-E was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In brief, 2 μg of biotinylated Hep or CS-E was immobilized on a 96-well BD BioCoat® streptavidin assay plate. After overnight blocking with 3% BSA in PBS, 1 pmol of MK in PBS was added to each well followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h. Goat anti-human MK antibody (diluted 200-fold with PBS) was added to each well after washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated AffiniPure rabbit anti-goat IgG (diluted 5,000-fold in TBS) was added to each well and left for 1 h at room temperature. After TBST washing,p-nitrophenyl phosphate in bicarbonate buffer (0.1m Na2CO3/NaHCO3containing 1 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8) was added to the wells and the development of color was measured after 15 min, at 415 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad model 550). Biotinylated CS-E and biotinylated Hep were immobilized individually on the surface of a biotin cuvette as follows. The sensor surface of a biotin cuvette (Affinity sensors, Cambridge, UK) was equilibrated with PBST. Streptavidin (2 μg) was immobilized on the biotin cuvette for 15 min, and 10 μg of biotinylated CS-E or biotinylated Hep was added to the cuvette after washing with PBST. Biotinylated CS-E gave a response of 42 arc seconds corresponding to 0.3 ng of the sample, whereas biotinylated Hep gave a response of 39 arc seconds corresponding to 0.26 ng of the sample, indicating that ∼0.003% of the biotinylated sample was immobilized (600 arc seconds correspond to 1 ng of protein/mm2 of the 4-mm2 cuvette surface). After 10 min the cuvette was again washed with PBST and blocked with 20 μg of BSA. The successful immobilization was tested by applying 200 ng of MK to the cuvette surface. It gave a response of 80 arc seconds for the CS-E cuvette and 125 arc seconds for the Hep cuvette. A control cuvette was prepared in a manner similar to that for the CS-E or Hep cuvette, except that no biotinylated sample was added for immobilization. A single binding assay consisted of the following steps. To the CS-E- or Hep-immobilized cuvette, which was preequilibrated with PBST, a known concentration of each growth factor (final volume 200 μl) was added to initiate the association phase, and the binding reaction was continued for 10 min. The cuvette was then washed three times with 200 μl of PBST, and the dissociation of the bound ligate into the bulk PBST was followed for 3 min. To remove the residual bound ligate and thus regenerate the immobilized ligand, the cuvette was washed with 200 μl of 1 m NaCl. The stirrer speed was maintained at 80% (a percentage value specifying the amplitude of stirrer oscillation at 140 Hz. The scale was linear with 0 corresponding to no oscillation and 100 corresponding to the maximum level), and the temperature was maintained at 25 °C throughout the experiment. The distribution of the immobilized CS-E or Hep and of the bound growth factor on the surface of the biosensor cuvette was inspected by examination of the resonance scan, which showed that at all times these molecules were distributed on the sensor surface and therefore were not microaggregated. To determine the binding kinetics, growth factors at varying concentrations were applied to the cuvette in the running buffer, followed by dissociation and regeneration, as described previously. Binding parameters were calculated from the association and dissociation phases of the binding reactions using the FASTfit software (Affinity Sensors). Using FASTfit, a plot of the on-rate constant,k on (obtained from association analysis)versus the ligand concentration was obtained. The slope of the line is the association rate constant, ka, and the intercept value on the y axis is the dissociation rate constant, kd. The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, was calculated from the ratio (kd/ka) of the dissociation and association rate constants. For determination of Kd using the Scatchard plot analysis, the response at equilibrium, R eq, was plotted against R eq/[L], whereL was the ligate concentration. The slope of this plot equals −1/Ka, the association equilibrium constant, and Kd was calculated using the equation Kd = 1/Ka. For determination of Kd using the binding curve analysis, the ligate concentration [L] was plotted againstR eq, and the Kd was equal to the ligate concentration at R max/2. In view of our previous findings that the neuronal cell adhesion mediated by MK is specifically inhibited by oversulfated CS-E from squid cartilage (14Ueoka C. Kaneda N. Okazaki I. Nadanaka S.

The representative growth factors of the MK family, EGF family, and FGF family were chosen, and the interactions of CS-E with MK, PTN, HB-EGF, FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-10, and FGF-18 were analyzed. In addition, FGF-16, which is not expressed in the brain but is expressed in the brown adipocytes of rat embryos (41Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), was also tested to clarify the generality of a binding capacity of a Hep-binding growth factor to CS-E. Even though FGF-16 and FGF-18 are believed to bind Hep, no report is available demonstrating the direct binding of these growth factors to Hep. In the preliminary experiments, 82 ng of a [3H]CS-E preparation was incubated with a fixed amount (300 ng) of various growth factors separately, and the binding ability was evaluated using the filter binding assay. The same amount of [3H]Hep was treated with the individual growth factors in the same manner as positive controls. The results are summarized in Fig.1. The findings demonstrated direct binding of CS-E to MK, PTN, HB-EGF, FGF-2, FGF-10, FGF-16, and FGF-18, whereas the binding of FGF-1 to CS-E was very low compared with those of other growth factors (Fig. 1 C). The binding efficiency toward CS-E of all growth factors tested, except for FGF-1, was higher than that toward Hep, whereas FGF-2 exhibited the same degree of binding to CS-E and Hep. The degree of binding exhibited by most of the growth factors toward CS-E was in the range of 10–25%, except for FGF-1 (1.2%), whereas FGF-18 showed an exceptionally high degree of binding (∼40%) (Fig. 1 F). In the absence of any growth factor, the amount of CS-E or Hep bound to the filter was less than 0.2%. To confirm the specificity of these bindings toward CS-E, the binding of varying concentrations of the growth factors (150, 300, and 450 ng) to a fixed concentration of CS-E (82 ng) was investigated by filter binding assay. All of the growth factors bound to CS-E in a dose-dependent manner. Even though FGF-1 also bound to CS-E in a dose-dependent manner, the extent of binding was far less compared with that of other growth factors (2% for FGF-1 compared with 15–50% for other growth factors). In the case of PTN, the saturation level was attained with 300 ng of the protein. However, saturation levels were not reached for all others even with 450 ng of the corresponding protein (data not shown), presumably because multiple binding sites for each growth factor are embedded along the CS-E chain. No higher concentrations were tested because of the limited availability of the proteins. As expected, [3H]CS-E also exhibited a dose dependency for its binding toward these growth factors (Fig. 2). For a fixed amount (200 ng) of the individual growth factors, a saturation curve for [3H]CS-E was observed with less than 1 μg each of all of the growth factors tested. FGF-1 also exhibited a similar trend, but only 1.2% of [3H]CS-E was bound at the saturation level (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that the bindings of these growth factors, except for FGF-1, to CS-E were not caused merely by electrostatic interactions, but rather were highly specific. The binding of growth factors to CS-E was characterized further using the IAsys, where CS-E was immobilized, and soluble growth factors were added as analytes to mimic physiological conditions. Biotinylated CS-E was immobilized onto the biotin-coated sensor surface of the IAsys cuvette via streptavidin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A Hep-immobilized cuvette was used to determine the positive control values. In both cases, 0.26∼0.30 ng of the biotinylated sample was immobilized (see “Experimental Procedures”). The growth factors (200 ng each) were then added to the CS-E- or Hep-immobilized cuvette, individually, which had been"

By catalyzing the cross-linking between fibrin molecules, factor XIII forms fibrin clots for hemostasis and heals a wound. The crystal structure of human factor XIII has been determined, revealing that it consists of four domains with a cysteine protease-like active site (19Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C., Le Trong I. Bishop P.D.

Many TGases are homologous to human factor XIII and share the common feature of Ca2+-dependent catalytic activity (3Chung S.I. Folk J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 262-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A tissue-type TGase from red sea bream liver (fish-derived TGase (FTG)) is an example of such factor XIII-like TGases and shows 33% sequence homology to human factor XIII (7Yasueda H. Nakanishi K. Kumazawa Y. Nagase K. Motoki M. Matsui H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of FTG has also been determined (23Noguchi K. Ishikawa K. Yokoyama K. Ohtsuka T. Nio N. Suzuki E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12055-12059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The overall and active site structures of FTG are essentially similar to those of human factor XIII. A microbial TGase (MTG) has been isolated from the culture medium ofStreptoverticillium sp. S-8112 (24Ando H. Adachi M. Umeda K. Matsuura A. Nonaka M. Uchio R. Tanaka H. Motoki M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 2613-2617Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which has been identified as a variant of Sv. mobaraense. This enzyme is the first TGase obtained from a nonmammalian source. Thus far, few TGases have been identified from microorganisms, particularly fromStreptoverticillium species (25Duran R. Junqua M. Schmitter J.M. Gancet C. Goulas P. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of MTG is still unknown, this protein is secreted from the cytoplasm membrane as a zymogen and is activated by proteolytic processing (26Pasternack R. Dorsch S. Otterbach J.T. Robenek I.R. Wolf S. Fuchsbauer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast to many other TGases, the MTG activity is Ca2+-independent (24Ando H. Adachi M. Umeda K. Matsuura A. Nonaka M. Uchio R. Tanaka H. Motoki M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 2613-2617Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A sequence analysis of MTG by Edman degradation revealed that the protein consists of 331 amino acids with a molecular mass of 37.9 kDa (12Kanaji T. Ozaki H. Takao T. Kawajiri K. Ide H. Motoki M. Simonishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11565-11572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular weight of MTG is nearly half that of the factor XIII-like TGases. The amino acid sequence of MTG bears little significant homology to the factor XIII-like TGases or to any other sequences in the current protein sequence databases, except for the apparently homologous TGases fromSv. Cinnamoneum, etc. (25Duran R. Junqua M. Schmitter J.M. Gancet C. Goulas P. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast to the factor XIII-like TGase, which possesses an active site region consisting of the consensus sequence motif of thiol proteases, thus far only a single cysteine (Cys64) has been identified as the catalytic residue in the sequence of MTG (12Kanaji T. Ozaki H. Takao T. Kawajiri K. Ide H. Motoki M. Simonishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11565-11572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent NMR study revealed that the reaction rate and the substrate specificity for the acyl donor of MTG are higher and lower than those of the factor XIII-like TGases such as guinea pig liver TGase and FTG, respectively (27Shimba N. Yokoyama K. Suzuki E. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 1330-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the deamidation activity of MTG is weaker than that of FTG, etc., implying that it is difficult for the water molecule to play the role of an acyl acceptor (28Ohtsuka T. Umezawa Y. Nio N. Kubota K. J. Food Sci. 2001; 66: 25-29Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is anticipated that MTG has a novel three-dimensional structure and that its catalytic mechanism is different from that of the factor XIII-like TGase. These characteristics, including Ca2+-independence, the higher reaction rate, the broader substrate specificity for the acyl donor, the lower activity for deamidation, and the smaller molecular size, are advantageous for industrial applications of MTG. Actually, MTG is widely used to improve the physical and textural properties of many protein-rich foods such as tofu, boiled fish paste, and sausage (29Ikura K. Kometani T. Yoshikawa M. Sasaki R. Chiba H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1980; 44: 1567-1573Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 30Motoki M. Nio N. J. Food Sci. 1983; 48: 561-566Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 31Kurth L. Rogers P.J. J. Food Sci. 1984; 49: 573-576Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 32Zhu Y. Rinzema A. Tramper J. Bol J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 44: 277-282Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Because of the usefulness of the cross-linking reaction, applications of MTG to other protein-related fine chemicals are also expected. To investigate the structure/function relationship of MTG and to obtain basic information for protein engineering aimed at various industrial applications, we determined the structure of MTG by x-ray crystallography. Here, we describe the novel overall and active site structures of MTG determined at 2.4 Å resolution, and discuss the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. Three types of recombinant MTG were prepared for the crystallization. One is an MTG variant that has an additional Met residue at the N terminus of the natural MTG amino acid sequence (Met-MTG). The second is an MTG variant in which the amino acid sequence lacks the N-terminal Asp residue of the natural MTG and has a Ser residue as the N terminus (Ser-MTG). Recombinant Met-MTG and Ser-MTG were expressed as described previously (33Yokoyama K. Nakamura N. Seguro K. Kubota K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The third recombinant MTG has the same amino acid sequence as the natural MTG and will be designated as Asp-MTG or simply MTG. To produce Asp-MTG in Escherichia coli, the mature MTG sequence linked to the IEGR sequence (factor Xa recognition site) was expressed, and then the extra sequence was digested by factor Xa. The MTG expression plasmid, pETMTGXa-01, which has the IEGR coding sequence upstream of the MTG gene, was constructed. The base sequence corresponding to the IEGR sequence was added by PCR using pUCTRPMTG-02 (33Yokoyama K. Nakamura N. Seguro K. Kubota K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). pMTGF01(5′-cggatccatc gaaggtcgtg attctgacga tcgtgttact cc-3′) was the sense primer with the BamHI site and the IEGR coding sequence upstream of the MTG gene. pMTGR01 (5′-caatttgcga gctcattacg gccaaccctg) was the antisense primer with theSacI site. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Its sequence was confirmed, and the plasmid was designated as pGEMMTGXa, containing the lacZpromoter and the MTG gene in the same orientation. pET5a (Promega) was digested by EcoRI, blunt-ended, and digested byBamHI. pGEMMTGXa was digested by SalI, blunt-ended, and digested by BamHI. The small fragment containing the MTG gene was integrated into the above prepared pET5a, and the new plasmid was designated as pETMTGXa-01. E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Promega) harboring pETMTGXa-01 were cultivated as described previously (33Yokoyama K. Nakamura N. Seguro K. Kubota K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) except that MTG expression was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the optical density at 660 nm was 2.0. The cell pellets harvested from 800-ml cultures were disrupted by ultrasonication, and the inclusion bodies were obtained as described previously (33Yokoyama K. Nakamura N. Seguro K. Kubota K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MTG inclusion bodies were dissolved in 8 m urea containing 20 mmsodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Precipitates were removed by centrifugation. The solubilized MTG solution (20 ml; about 20 mg/ml) was adjusted to pH 4.0 by adding HCl and was diluted 50-fold to a concentration of 0.16 m urea using 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. After 2 h of incubation at 5 °C, the pH was shifted from 4.0 to 6.0. 2K. Yokoyama, K. Ono, T. Ohtsuka, N. Nakamura, K. Seguro, and D. Ejima, manuscript in preparation. Aggregates were removed by centrifugation after the dilution and the pH shift. The refolded MTG was concentrated about 10-fold and was applied to a gel filtration column (Sephadex G25M, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride, pH 7.5. Five mg of bovine factor Xa (Hematological Technologies, Inc.) was added to 250 ml of the buffer-exchanged solution (143 mg of MTG), which was incubated for 16 h at 5 °C, adjusted to pH 5.8 by HCl, and diluted 10-fold by 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8. It was applied to a cation-exchange column (CM-Sepharose FF, 2.6 × 10-cm internal diameter; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8. After the column was washed with 1 column volume of the same buffer, the MTG was eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 400 mm over 10 column volumes, at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions were collected and diluted 10-fold by 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5. They were applied to a cation-exchange column (Resource 6 ml; AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5. After the column was washed with 1 column volume of the same buffer, the MTG was eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 500 mm over 20 column volumes at a flow rate of 6 ml/min. Fractions that lacked impurities were assayed by analytical reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and the fractions of the low pI MTG variants, assayed by analytical cation-exchange chromatography, were pooled. For buffer exchange, the pooled fractions (12 ml, 41 mg of MTG) were applied to a gel filtration column (Sephadex G25M) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. The Asp-MTG, as prepared above, was found to be highly purified as compared with the purified natural MTG analyzed by isoelectric focusing. The crystallization experiments of Met-MTG, Ser-MTG, and Asp-MTG were executed under various conditions. However, we could not obtain good crystals from the Met-MTG and Ser-MTG samples. Only the Asp-MTG yielded crystals suitable for x-ray structural analysis, which were obtained under the following conditions. The crystallization of Asp-MTG was performed at 20 °C with the hanging drop mode of the vapor diffusion method. The crystallization solution in the reservoir had a volume of 500 μl and was composed of 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1000, 100 mm cacodylate-HCl buffer, pH 5.0, and 25 mm CaCl2. Two μl of MTG solution (15 mg/ml) and 2 μl of the reservoir solution were mixed and then equilibrated against the reservoir. After a few days, plate-like crystals emerged, which grew to a size (0.5 × 0.3 × 0.1 mm) sufficient for x-ray diffraction within about 10 days. During the collection of the x-ray diffraction data, the MTG crystal was flash-cooled at 100 K after equilibration against a cryosolvent containing 35% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1000, 120 mm cacodylate-HCl buffer, pH 5.0, and 35 mm CaCl2. The data collection statistics of the native MTG crystal are summarized in Table I. The diffraction data of the native crystal were collected using a macromolecular-oriented Weissenberg camera (35Sakabe N. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. Sect. A. 1991; 303: 448-463Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar) installed on beam line (BL) 6B at the Photon Factory (PF) of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics, Tsukuba, Japan. The x-ray wavelength was set to 1.00 Å, and the diffraction path was filled with helium gas to avoid air scattering. Diffraction intensities were recorded on imaging plates (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.) using the oscillation method. The diffraction data were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). The native crystal of MTG diffracted up to 2.4 Å resolution. It belongs to the space group P21, with unit cell dimensions of a = 78.41 Å, b = 117.12 Å,c = 85.74 Å, and β = 112.80°.

Open table in a new tab The crystallographic analysis of MTG was performed by the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method. The screening of several heavy atom compounds using the SMART6000 diffractometer (Bruker AXS) operated at 50 kV, 90 mA with CuKα radiation revealed that soaking with ethyl mercurithiosalicylate, K2OsCl6, and K2IrCl6 yielded good heavy atom derivatives. The data collection statistics of the derivative crystals used for the phase calculation are also summarized in Table I. The MIR analysis and the subsequent phase improvement were executed using the CCP4 program suite (37Beiley S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar). The interpretation of the electron density map and the model building were performed using the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulation Inc.) on an Octane graphics work station (Silicon Graphics Inc.). The difference Patterson map between the ethyl mercurithiosalicylate derivative and native crystals presented four strong peaks, corresponding to major mercury sites. After the structural determination, each site was found to lie near the Sγ atom of Cys64. The heavy atom sites of the other derivative crystals were determined using the difference Fourier maps phased by the major mercury sites of the ethyl mercurithiosalicylate derivative. The phase refinement was iteratively performed using the program MLPHARE in CCP4, with gradual inclusion of the minor heavy atom sites. The final figure-of-merit value became 0.458. The other statistics of MIR phasing are summarized in Table I. The MIR electron density map (40.0–2.7 Å resolution) was of a poor quality and difficult to interpret. The MIR phases were improved using the program DM in CCP4. At first, the solvent flattening procedure was reiterated on the condition of 50% solvent content, using the 40.0–2.7 Å resolution data. The electron density map was improved and showed a clear protein-solvent boundary and many α-helices. At this stage, it was revealed that the crystal contains four MTG molecules (molecules A, B, C, and D)/asymmetric unit. In the next step, the phases were further improved by the molecular averaging procedure. The noncrystallographic symmetry parameters were initially determined by superimposing the positions of the mercury and Cα atoms on the longest α-helices of molecules B, C, and D onto those of molecule A. The noncrystallographic symmetry parameters were refined during the molecular averaging procedure performed at 40.0–2.7 Å resolution. The molecular averaging procedure was successfully finished, yielding improved values for the mean figure-of-merit of combined phases (0.732 → 0.816) and the correlation coefficient (0.492 → 0.876). The map was further improved so that almost the entire chains of all of the molecules could be traced. All of the residues of the MTG molecules could be assigned unambiguously to the electron density map. The constructed model of MTG was subjected to crystallographic refinement using the simulated annealing procedure of the program X-PLOR (38Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, version 3.1, A System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The refinement was executed with the data corrected by the bulk solvent mask procedure of this program. During refinement, some manual rebuilding of the protein molecules was performed. After the R crystdropped to 0.246, water molecules were added to the model. Finally, theR cryst and the R free (5% test set) for the final model against 54,496 reflections (greater than 2ς(F)) within 40.0–2.4 Å resolution were 0.199 and 0.266, respectively. The final model includes four MTG molecules, each consisting of 331 amino acid residues, and 550 water molecules. The root-mean-square deviations in bond length and bond angle are 0.020 Å and 3.655°, respectively. A Ramachandran plot analysis of the four MTG molecules in the unit cell using the program PROCHECK (39Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thoronton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) revealed that 86.7% of the residues are in the most favored regions, 11.6% of the residues are in additional allowed regions, 1.6% of the residues are in generously allowed regions, and 0.1% of the residues are in disallowed regions. The overall structures of the four independent MTG molecules are almost identical. The root-mean-square deviations of the Cα atom positions between the four MTG molecules range from 0.54 to 0.68 Å. In the crystal structure, molecules A and B and molecules C and D are related by noncrystallographic 2-fold axes, respectively. The interactions between them are slightly more extensive than the other intermolecular interactions in the crystal. However, the functional meaning of these dimers is questionable because there is no evidence supporting MTG dimer formation under physiological conditions. The N-terminal Asp residue of each MTG molecule tightly interacts with adjacent residues of the symmetry related molecules.

https://openalex.org/W1903108056,"The IKKβ and NEMO/IKKγ subunits of the NF-κB-activating signalsome complex are known to be essential for activating NF-κB by inflammatory and other stress-like stimuli. However, the IKKα subunit is believed to be dispensable for the latter responses and instead functions as an in vivomediator of other novel NF-κB-dependent and -independent functions. In contrast to this generally accepted view of IKKα's physiological functions, we demonstrate in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that, akin to IKKβ and NEMO/IKKγ, IKKα is also a global regulator of tumor necrosis factor α- and IL-1-responsive IKK signalsome-dependent target genes including many known NF-κB targets such as serum amyloid A3, C3, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, IL-1 receptor antagonist, vascular endothelial growth factor, Ptx3, β2-microglobulin, IL-1α, Mcp-1 and -3, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), Fas antigen, Jun-B, c-Fos, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Only a small number of NF-κB-dependent target genes were preferentially dependent on IKKα or IKKβ. Constitutive expression of a trans-dominant IκBα superrepressor (IκBαSR) in wild type MEFs confirmed that these signalsome-dependent target genes were also dependent on NF-κB. A subset of NF-κB target genes were IKK-dependent in the absence of exogenous stimuli, suggesting that the signalsome was also required to regulate basal levels of activated NF-κB in established MEFs. Overall, a sizable number of novel NF-κB/IKK-dependent genes were identified including Secreted Frizzled, cadherin 13, protocadherin 7, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β and -δ, osteoprotegerin, FOXC2 and FOXF2, BMP-2, p75 neurotrophin receptor, caspase-11, guanylate-binding proteins 1 and 2, ApoJ/clusterin, interferon (α and β) receptor 2, decorin, osteoglycin, epiregulin, proliferins 2 and 3, stromal cell-derived factor, and cathepsins B, F, and Z. SOCS-3, a negative effector of STAT3 signaling, was found to be an NF-κB/IKK-induced gene, suggesting that IKK-mediated NF-κB activation can coordinately illicit negative effects on STAT signaling.

SOCS-3, a negative effector of STAT3 signaling, was found to be an NF-κB/IKK-induced gene, suggesting that IKK-mediated NF-κB activation can coordinately illicit negative effects on STAT signaling. The NF-κB transcription factors are pivotal regulators of gene expression programs culminating in stress-like responses and the genesis of innate and acquired immunity (reviewed in Refs. 1Baldwin Jr., A.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Google Scholar, 4Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Google Scholar). A host of extracellular stimuli including inflammatory cytokines, viral and bacterial infections, oxidative and DNA-damaging agents, UV light, and osmotic shock can all result in NF-κB activation (1Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar, 3Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Google Scholar, 4Barkett M. Gilmore T.D.

NF-κB transcription factors bind to DNA as hetero- or homodimers that are selectively derived from five possible subunits (RelA/p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52) with each binding to half of a conserved 10-base pair consensus sequence (GGGRNWTYCC) (1Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar, 5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar). Whereas the RelA/p65 and p50 subunits are ubiquitously expressed, the p52, c-Rel, and RelB subunits are more functionally important in specific differentiated cell types (1Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar, 6Liou H.C. Sha W.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5349-5359Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic p50/p65 heterodimers, c-Rel homodimers, and RelB are bound to IκBs (inhibitors of NF-κB), thereby sequestering them in the cytoplasm of most cells that are not experiencing a stress-like response (1Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar, 5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar). Activators of NF-κB mediate the site-specific phosphorylation of two amino-terminal serines on each IκB, which makes the nearby lysines targets for ubiquitination, thereby resulting in IκB proteasomal destruction. NF-κB is then free to translocate to the nucleus and bind DNA leading to the activation of a host of inflammatory response target genes (1Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar,5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that NF-κB subunits dynamically shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, but a dominant acting nuclear export signal in IκBα ensures their transport back to the cytoplasm. It was recently shown that nuclear retention of RelA/p65 is regulated by reversible acetylation, with its acetylated form being severely compromised for interaction with IκBα (7Chen L.F. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Google Scholar). In contrast to RelA/p65, c-Rel, and RelB, the NF-κB p50 and p52 subunits are derived from p105 and p100 precursor proteins by removal of carboxyl-terminal IκB-like domains, which possess the inhibitory properties of IκBs (8Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Fujita T. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3003-3009Google Scholar, 9Hatada E.N. Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2781-2788Google Scholar, 10Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Google Scholar), with the processing of these precursor proteins being initiated by signal-induced phosphorylation. Although NF-κB is largely considered to be a transcriptional activator, under certain circumstances it can also be involved in directly repressing gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 1Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar and 5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar). In the latter scenario, direct repression can result if activation domain-deficient homodimers of the NF-κB p50 and p52 subunits bind to NF-κB target sequences instead of activating p50/p65 heterodimers (11Kang S.M. Tran A.C. Grilli M. Lenardo M.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1452-1456Google Scholar, 12Plaksin D. Baeuerle P.A. Eisenbach L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1651-1662Google Scholar, 13Brown A.M. Linhoff M.W. Stein B. Wright K.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Basta P.V. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2926-2935Google Scholar). The IκB homologue Bcl3, an abundant nuclear IκB-like protein that is not degraded by NF-κB activating pathways, has been reported to have diverse effects on the binding of p50 or p52 homodimers to DNA depending on its state of phosphorylation, concentration, and association with nuclear cofactors (14Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Scheidereit C. Nature. 1992; 358: 597-599Google Scholar, 15Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Google Scholar, 16Nolan G.P.

Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Google Scholar). Bcl3 readily forms ternary complexes with DNA-bound p50 and p52 homodimers and in that context functions like a transcriptional activator, with its activation potential enhanced by interaction with the Tip60 histone acetylase (15Bours V.

Complexes of Bcl3/p50 homodimers were recently shown to contribute to the transcriptional activation of the survival-promoting Bcl2 NF-κB target gene (21Kurland J.F. Kodym R. Story M.D. Spurgers K.B. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45380-45386Google Scholar). Bcl3-p50 complexes form with the same kinetics as p50/p65 heterodimers but are independent of p50/p65 release from IκBα, implicating a p105 proteolysis pathway in their production (10Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Google Scholar). IκB phosphorylation is mediated by a high molecular weight signalsome complex consisting of two IκB kinases (IKKα and IKKβ, also known as IKK1/CHUK and IKK2, respectively) and a noncatalytic regulatory subunit (NEMO/NF-κB essential modulator, also known as IKKγ/IKKAP-1/FIP-3) (reviewed in Refs. 3Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Google Scholar, 4Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Google Scholar, and 22Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Google Scholar). Two molecules of NEMO are believed to orchestrate the assembly of the IKKs into the high molecular weight signalsome complex partially by binding to specific carboxyl-terminally conserved residues of both IKKα and IKKβ termed the NEMO binding domain (NBD) (23Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Tegethoff S. Li J. Klippel A. Giese K. Baeuerle P.A. Scheidereit C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29779-29787Google Scholar, 24Li X.H. Fang X. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol.

Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Google Scholar). NEMO may also facilitate the recruitment of IκBα to the IKK complex (27Yamamoto Y. Kim D.W. Kwak Y.T. Prajapati S. Verma U. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36327-36336Google Scholar). The two catalytic IKK subunits differentially respond via NEMO to an array of signal induced upstream kinase activities culminating in the coordinated phosphorylation of a pair of serines in their MAPK-like T activation loops by an unknown mechanism. The roles of the IKKs in NF-κB activation have been investigated in mice lacking IKKβ, IKKα, or NEMO (28Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M.

Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Google Scholar), murine embryos genetically null for either IKKβ or NEMO succumbed to severe liver apoptosisin utero due to a virtually complete block in NF-κB activation (28Li Q.

These IKKβ and NEMO KO animals were severely if not completely deficient for both cytokine-mediated IκB degradation and nuclear NF-κB DNA binding activity (28Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F.

In contrast to the IKKβ and NEMO KO mice, IKKα null animals died prenatally due to severe skin, limb, and skeletal abnormalities caused by a block in the terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes (31Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang J.Y. Buscher D. Lee K.F. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1322-1328Google Scholar, 32Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M.

Furthermore, IKKα null embryos appeared to be phenotypically normal for both cytokine-induced IκBα degradation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, and NF-κB DNA binding activity (32Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Google Scholar,33Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Google Scholar). Subsequent work revealed that IKKα (independent of both its kinase activity and NF-κB) controls the production of a soluble factor that induces keratinocyte differentiation (38Hu Y. Baud V. Oga T. Kim K.I. Yoshida K. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 710-714Google Scholar). Activation of IKKβ depends upon signal-induced phosphorylation of serines 177 and 181 in its T activation loop (39Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Google Scholar, 40Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Google Scholar). However, unlike IKKβ, a catalytic inactive mutant of IKKα with alanines replacing serines 176 and 180 in its analogous T activation loop (IKKαAA) had no demonstrable affect on the activity of IKK holocomplexes to induce IκBα degradation or NF-κB DNA binding activity in response to inflammatory cytokine stimuli in either transfected cells (40Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Google Scholar) or fibroblasts derived from IKKαAA/AA knockin mice (41Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Google Scholar). It is important to note in this context that several reports of IKKα not affecting NF-κB activation in response to inflammatory stimuli in cells derived from IKKα(−/−) or IKKαAA/AA knockin mice did not address whether nuclear NF-κB was fully transcriptionally competent in these mutant cells (32Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Google Scholar, 33Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Google Scholar, 41Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Google Scholar). However, there appear to be some inconsistencies with this generally accepted view, since two groups reported some deficiencies in NF-κB transcriptional competence in IKKα(−/−) embryonic fibroblasts although IκBα degradation and NF-κB DNA binding activity appeared to be normal in these cells (31Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang J.Y. Buscher D. Lee K.F. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1322-1328Google Scholar, 42Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3863-3869Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this body of work has led to the well accepted tenet that IKKβ alone is essential for NF-κB activation by inflammatory response mediators (22Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Google Scholar, 25Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Google Scholar, 43Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar, 44Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109 (Suppl.): 81-96Google Scholar). More recently and in keeping with its separate and distinct functions from IKKβ, IKKα has been shown to possess at least two additional novel in vivo functions: (a) it is essential for B lymphocyte maturation (45Kaisho T. Takeda K. Tsujimura T. Kawai T. Nomura F. Terada N. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 417-426Google Scholar) and Peyers patch formation via an LTβR- and NIK-dependent signaling pathway (46Matsushima A. Kaisho T. Rennert P.D. Nakano H. Kurosawa K. Uchida D. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 631-636Google Scholar), wherein it is required to target the cytokine-induced processing of the NF-κB2 (p100) precursor to produce functional NF-κB p52 subunit (47Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M.

Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Google Scholar). Independent of these studies, IKKβ was reported to phosphorylate an IκB-like destruction motif in the p50 p105 precursor, which produces a recognition site for βTrCP-containing SCF ubiquitin ligases with subsequent polyubiquitination of p105 causing its complete proteasomal destruction and the induced release of DNA-binding p50 homodimers (10Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Google Scholar, 48Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1024-1035Google Scholar), providing additional support for the notion that IKKβ and IKKα have distinct roles in NF-κB activation. In this report, we have addressed the roles of each subunit of the NF-κB activating signalsome in the global control of NF-κB target genes. By employing DNA microarrays, we show that IKKα is just as critical as IKKβ and NEMO/IKKγ for the global activation of NF-κB-dependent, TNFα- and IL-1-responsive genes. These experiments also identified a number of novel NF-κB-dependent genes including a variety of regulatory factors, growth-promoting activities, and inflammatory response mediators. A significant fraction of the IKK/NF-κB target genes were also dependent on the IKKs for their relative levels of expression in the absence of extracellular NF-κB activating stimuli, suggesting that the signalsome is also involved in positively regulating the basal levels of NF-κB-responsive genes in MEFs. Wild type MEFs and mutant IKKα(−/−), IKKβ (−/−), and NEMO/IKKγ(−/−) MEFs (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Karin, University of California, San Diego) were routinely cultured in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. In most experiments, the endogenous IKK complex was activated by either human TNFα (10 ng/ml) (Invitrogen) or IL-1β (50 ng/ml) (Pharmingen) signaling for 2 h with exceptions noted throughout. In some experiments, de novo cellular protein synthesis was inhibited by the addition of 100 μm anisomycin (Sigma) to block translational initiation prior to the addition of TNFα followed by co-incubation with TNFα and anisomycin for up to 2 h. A trans-dominant IκBα (S32A/S36A) super-repressor (IκBαSR), with serines 32 and 36 mutated to alanines, was introduced into wild type MEFs by retroviral infection as previously described (49Li J. Peet G.W. Balzarano D. Li X. Massa P. Barton R.W. Marcu K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18579-18590Google Scholar). Following infection with a recombinant murine retrovirus harboring an IκBαSR-IRES-Neomycin expression cassette, neomycin-resistant MEF populations were obtained after 6–8 days of selection in 800 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) (49Li J. Peet G.W. Balzarano D. Li X. Massa P. Barton R.W. Marcu K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18579-18590Google Scholar). Total cellular RNAs were extracted from cell lysates with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Purified RNAs were converted to double-stranded cDNA with a double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT) primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (GENSET). Biotin-labeled cRNAs were generated from the cDNA samples by an in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Enzo kit; Enzo Diagnostics). The labeled cRNAs were fragmented to an average size of 35–200 bases by incubation at 94 °C for 35 min. Hybridization (16 h), washing, and staining protocols have been described (Affymetrix Gene Chip® Expression Analysis Technical Manual) (50Mahadevappa M. Warrington J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1134-1136Google Scholar). We employed Affymetrix MG-U74Av2 chips, which include ∼6,000 functionally characterized sequences of the murine UniGene data base in addition to ∼6,000 expressed sequence tag clusters. Chips were stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and scanned with a Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner. DNA microarray chip data analysis was performed using MAS4.0 software (Affymetrix). The quantitation of each gene expressed was calculated from the hybridization intensities of 16 pairs of perfectly matched and mismatched control probes (51Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Google Scholar) (Affymetrix Inc.). The average of the differences (perfectly matched minus mismatched) for each gene-specific probe family was calculated. The software computes a variety of different parameters to determine whether an RNA molecule is present or absent (Absolute Call) and whether each transcript's expression level has changed between the base-line and experimental samples (Difference Call). For a comparative chip file (such as TNFα-stimulated WT MEF versus WT MEF/IκBαSR), the experimental file (WT(S), where S represents stimulated) was compared with the base-line file (IκBαSR(S)). To minimize false positives, the following criteria were selected for significant changes for each primary screen: (a) the change in the average difference across all probe sets was at least 2-fold; (b) for induced genes, a difference call of “increase” or “marginal increase” should be present, and an absolute call of “presence” should be associated with the experimental file; and (c) for repressed genes, a difference call of “decrease” or “marginal decrease” should be present, and an absolute call of “presence” should be associated with the base-line file. Hierarchical clustering was performed with the Cluster program (available on the World Wide Web at rana.lbl.gov/) as described previously (52Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Google Scholar), and all genes showing at least 2-fold induction in the primary screen WT MEF versus WT MEF/IκBαSR were included. The average difference values (representing the quantity of mRNA; see above) of the selected genes were subtracted by the average difference value of the WT unstimulated sample, normalized by genes to the magnitude (sum of the squares of the values) of a row vector to 1.0. The normalized data were clustered by average linkage clustering analysis of y axis (genes) using an uncentered correlation similarity metric, as described in the program Cluster. Average difference values of 50 or less were set to 50 before WT unstimulated centering and normalization. The clustered data were visualized by the program TreeView (available on the World Wide Web at rana.lbl.gov/). RT-PCRs were performed as previously described (49Li J. Peet G.W. Balzarano D. Li X.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2635-2649Google Scholar). To establish their relative qualities, serial dilutions of cDNAs were amplified with β-actin and GAPDH-specific primers for internal standardization. Similarly, linear response ranges were determined for each gene to semiquantify their expression levels. In all cases, the sizes of PCR products corresponded to those expected for each gene. PCR primer pairs were 22–24-mers, and their nucleotide sequences will be provided upon request. TaqMan Real time quantitative PCR was based on the fluorogenic 5′-nuclease assay (54Livak K.J. Flood S.J. Marmaro J. Giusti W. Deetz K. PCR Methods Appl. 1995; 4: 357-362Google Scholar). The same total RNA samples that were used to prepare probes for microarray hybridization were treated with DNase I followed by the RNeasy Mini protocol for RNA cleanup (Qiagen). The TaqMan probe consists of an oligonucleotide with a 5′-reporter dye (6-carboxyfluorescein) and a 3′-quencher dye (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine). To measure the gene copy numbers of the target transcript, cloned plasmid DNA or mouse genomic DNA was serially diluted and used to produce a standard curve as described elsewhere (55Li X. Wang X. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 2000; 5: 211-217Google Scholar). Data from TaqMan PCR analyses were normalized based on mRNA copy numbers of GAPDH using the TaqMan rodent GAPDH control reagents (Applied Biosystems). We previously reported that IL-1 or lipopolysaccharide signaling via NEMO in a differentiating pre-B cell line induced a host of novel NF-κB-dependent target genes but surprisingly also coordinately down-modulated a large group of genes, which were also dependent on NF-κB for their repression (49Li J. Peet G.W. Balzarano D. Li X. Massa P. Barton R.W. Marcu K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18579-18590Google Scholar). However, in this latter cell context we were not able to determine the individual roles of the IKKα or IKKβ signalsome subunits for the stimulation or repression of these novel NF-κB/NEMO-dependent ge"
https://openalex.org/W2020331445,"Next Section Abstract Mutations in the phosphotyrosine binding domain protein ARH cause autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia, a disorder caused by defective internalization of low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) in the liver. To examine the function of ARH, we used pull-down experiments to test for interactions between ARH, the LDLR, and proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The phosphotyrosine binding domain of ARH interacted with the internalization sequence (NPVY) in the cytoplasmic tail of LDLR in a sequence-specific manner. Mutations in the NPVY sequence that were previously shown to decrease LDLR internalization abolished in vitro binding to ARH. Recombinant ARH bound purified bovine clathrin with high affinity (K D, ∼44 nm). The interaction between ARH and clathrin was mapped to a canonical clathrin box sequence (LLDLE) in ARH and to the N-terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain. A highly conserved 20-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region of ARH bound the β2-adaptin subunit of AP-2. Mutation of a glutamic acid residue in the appendage domain of β2-adaptin that is required for interaction with the adapter protein β-arrestin markedly reduced binding to ARH. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that ARH functions as an adaptor protein that couples LDLR to the endocytic machinery."

Cultured keratinocytes express the sodium-proton exchanger (NHE) 1The abbreviations used are: NHE, sodium-proton exchanger; β-Glc-Cer'ase, β-glucocerebrosidase; aSM'ase, acid-sphingomyelinase; cUCA, cis-urocanic acid; FLIM, fluorescence lifetime imaging; SC, stratum corneum; SG, stratum granulosum; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate class of non-energy-dependent transporters, which controls intracellular pH (1Mauro T. Dixon D.B. Hanley K. Isseroff R.R. Pappone P.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 203-208Google Scholar). Recently, the NHE1 isoform has been shown to be the only isoform in keratinocytes and epidermis (2Sarangarajan R. Shumaker H. Soleimani M. Le Poole C. Boissy R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1511: 181-192Google Scholar). Acidification is essential for the epidermal permeability barrier, as shown by the observation that barrier recovery proceeds normally at an acidic pH, but is delayed at a neutral pH (i.e. pH 7–7.4) as a result of impaired post-secretory processing of secreted, extracellular lipids in the lower SC (3Mauro T. Holleran W.M. Grayson S. Gao W.N. Man M.Q. Kriehuber E. Behne M. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1998; 290: 215-222Google Scholar). The delay in recovery at a neutral pH is explained by the in situ activity profiles of β-glucocerebrosidase (β-Glc-Cer'ase), and acid-sphingomyelinase (aSM'ase) in the SC, which lack activity at a neutral pH (4Holleran W.M. Takagi Y. Imokawa G. Jackson S. Lee J.M. Elias P.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1201-1209Google Scholar, 5Takagi Y. Kriehuber E. Imokawa G. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 861-869Google Scholar). β-Glc-Cer'ase and aSM'ase comprise two key lipid hydrolases, which are critical for the formation of mature extracellular lamellar bilayers (6Schmuth M. Man M.Q. Weber F. Gao W. Feingold K.R. Fritsch P. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 459-466Google Scholar, 7Jensen J.M. Schutze S. Forl M. Kronke M. Proksch E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1761-1770Google Scholar), and both are required for the normal processing of secreted polar lipid precursors into their more non-polar species. The acidic pH of the SC has been attributed largely to mechanisms extrinsic to the epidermis, such as: (a) byproducts of microbial metabolism (8Korting H.C. Kober M. Mueller M. Braun-Falco O. Acta Derm. Venereol. 1987; 67: 41-47Google Scholar); (b) lactic acid and lactate from sweat (9Patterson M.J. Galloway S.D. Nimmo M.A. Exp. Physiol. 2000; 85: 869-875Google Scholar); (c) free fatty acids (10Fluhr J.W. Kao J. Jain M. Ahn S.K. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 44-51Google Scholar); (d) progressive desiccation of the SC (11Ohman H. Vahlquist A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 674-677Google Scholar), and/or (e) generation of the organic acid, cis-urocanic acid (cUCA) from filaggrin (12Krien P.M. Kermici M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 414-420Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that NHE1 deletion or pharmacologic inhibition elevates SC pH and impedes both lipid processing and resulting barrier repair, suggesting this agent is essential in establishing and/or maintaining SC pH. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of NHE1 on extracellular acidification of the SC and to visualize the spatial distribution of the SC pH gradient. Because the origin and character of the acidic pH of the SC have been difficult to study, we adapted a more sophisticated method, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), to investigate SC pH (13Hanson K.M. Behne M.J. Barry N.P. Mauro T.M. Gratton E. Clegg R.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1682-1690Google Scholar). Using this method, we find that the pH “gradient” is not uniform, and that NHE1 preferentially acidifies extracellular domains at and just above the stratum granulosum (SG)-SC junction. Moreover, NHE1 expression increases in the outer epidermis, in an increasingly apical pattern, thus providing the acidic milieu necessary for formation of mature extracellular lipid bilayers in the SC. Amiloride and HEPES were purchased from Sigma. 2′,7′-Bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). HOE694 was kindly provided by Dr. H. J. Lang (Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Male hairless mice (SKH1 hr/hr, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were fed Purina mouse diet and waterad libitum. Animals were 8–12 weeks old at time of experiments. Heterozygous, NHE1-deficient mice (14Bell S.M. Schreiner C.M. Schultheis P.J. Miller M.L. Evans R.L. Vorhees C.V. Shull G.E. Scott W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C788-C795Google Scholar) were bred locally from heterozygous founders received from Dr. G. E. Shull (Cincinnati, OH), and each litter was genotyped separately. Mice were maintained on a mixed background of SVJ129 and Black Swiss, and inbred for at least 4 generations. Functional experiments were performed on animals aged 6–10 weeks. Fresh biopsies from NHE1 +/+ or −/− mice were formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned (5 μm). For immunolabeling of NHE1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was used (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), which was detected via a FITC-labeled, secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cappel, Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC). Sections were counterstained with propidium iodide (Sigma), and pictures were taken on a Leica TCS-SP confocal microscope. pH was determined using the lifetime-sensitive fluorescent pH indicator BCECF (Molecular Probes). We have examined the question of possible vehicle toxicity in previous studies and found that applications of propylene glycol/ethanol (in a 7:3 mix) do not exhibit deleterious effects on either permeability barrier function or on the structure of the SC, and do not alter the kinetics of barrier recovery in acute experiments (see, e.g., Ref. 15Man M.Q. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. Arch. Dermatol. 1993; 129: 728-738Google Scholar). Moreover, following prolonged ethanol exposure (twice daily over 7 days), such effects are limited to superficial layers of the SC, where SC interstices are expanded without disrupting the lamellar lipid domains. Even under these conditions, ethanol neither breaches the corneocyte, nor the barrier-forming, lower two thirds of the SC (16Menon G.K. Elias P.M. Skin Pharmacol. 1997; 10: 235-246Google Scholar), definitely excluding the nucleated layers of the epidermis (17Komuves L.G. Hanley K. Man M.Q. Elias P.M. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 361-367Google Scholar), with no effects on base line barrier function (18Menon G.K. Feingold K.R. Mao-Qiang M. Schaude M. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 209-219Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In these experiments, the solvent was a 7:3 mix of propylene glycol and ethanol, used because it produces better SC penetration. Whereas propylene glycol/ethanol elicits the minor effects described above, ethanol alone would be expected to produce even fewer effects because of rapid surface evaporation. The dye was therefore applied in pure ethanol (58–120 μm BCECF), four times over the course of 1 h, and reapplied only after remaining ethanol had evaporated. A biopsy was taken ∼15 min following the last dye application, mounted for microscopy, and directly visualized (maximum time delay 1 h). Additionally, we examined the possible influence of cholesterol as a key epidermal lipid, and ethanol as the solvent in our experiments on lifetime measurements. A saturated solution of cholesterol in buffer did not affect lifetimes, when corrected for its index of refraction. Similarly, water/ethanol mixtures with up to 5% ethanol also did not change lifetime, even without a correction for refraction. Two-photon FLIM (19Masters B.R. So P.T. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2405-2412Google Scholar, 20Szmacinski H. Lakowicz J.R. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 1668-1674Google Scholar, 21Tadrous P.J. J. Pathol. 2000; 191: 229-234Google Scholar) was used to determine pH. The specific protocols used to determine pH as a function of epidermal depth and cellular location were validated (13Hanson K.M. Behne M.J. Barry N.P. Mauro T.M. Gratton E. Clegg R.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1682-1690Google Scholar). In brief, a Millenia-pumped Tsunami titanium:sapphire laser system (Spectra-Physics) was used as the two-photon excitation source. Two-photon excitation of the sample was achieved by coupling the 820-nm output of the laser through the epifluorescence port of a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Less than 1 milliwatt was used to excite the sample. The excitation beam was diverted to the sample by a dichroic filter, and the fluorescence was collected using a Hamamatsu (R3996) photomultiplier placed at the bottom port of the microscope. Scanning mirrors and a 40× infinity corrected oil objective (Zeiss F Fluar, 1.3 numeric aperture) were used to image areas of 214 μm2. Z-slices (1.7 μm/slice) were obtained by adjusting the objective focus with a motorized driver (ASI Multi-Scan 4). Lifetime data were acquired using the frequency-domain method (80 MHz). Fluorescein was used as the reference lifetime standard (τf = 4.05 ns, pH 9.5). Data evaluation and visualization were performed directly with the in-house software SIM-FCS. Fluorescence intensity images were adjusted to enhance structural features and to visualize dye distribution and penetration. Lifetime values were converted to pH values, based on a calibration of BCECF in a series of buffers of different pH. The resulting pH maps are displayed on the same color scale to facilitate comparisons. The pH value distribution within these images is depicted in the corresponding histograms. Individual images in Fig. 2 were combined using Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA), but no further image processing was performed. Background fluorescence was measured in samples of unstained tissue, treated otherwise identically. Intensity counts were always below 10/50 μs, even in surface images (or below 5% of the low intensity images in the series presented here) (13Hanson K.M. Behne M.J. Barry N.P. Mauro T.M. Gratton E. Clegg R.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1682-1690Google Scholar). Transepidermal water loss was measured with an electrolytic water analyzer (MEECO, Warrington, PA). Individually tested sites were covered with Hilltop chambers (nominal volume 200 μl), which were reapplied following each individual measurement. For topical inhibitor applications, solutions of HEPES buffer (10 mm) at either pH 7.4 or 5.5, contained either amiloride (5 μm), HOE694 (7.5 μm), or buffer alone. The inhibitor-concentrations were chosen in the range of the published 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for NHE1 inhibitory compounds in fibroblasts (22Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Google Scholar, 23Counillon L. Scholz W. Lang H.J. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1041-1045Google Scholar). The SC of hairless mice was removed from two sites by several sequential strippings with adhesive tape (Tesa, Beiersdorf, Germany), inducing an increase in transepidermal water loss levels above base line (from <0.2 to ∼7–9 g/m2/h). After stripping, inhibitors (conditions as above) were applied and transepidermal water loss was measured at 0, 2, 5, and 24 h. For studies in NHE1 knockout mice, homozygous (−/−) mice were compared with their wild-type (+/+) littermates, or age-matched wild-type animals of the same inbreeding generation. Flanks of these mice were shaved, and barrier homeostasis was studied between 48 and 96 h later. For tape-stripping of these animals, D-squame disks (Acaderm, Menlo Park, CA) were used, as Tesa tape was too disruptive for application to shaved, hairy mouse skin. Conventional surface pH measurements were performed using a flat glass surface electrode (Mettler-Toledo, Giessen, Germany) with a pH meter (Skin pH Meter PH 900; Courage & Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). Freshly obtained biopsies from mouse skin (inhibitor and buffer-treated hairless mice 5 h following tape-stripping; NHE1 −/− and +/+ mice 8 h following tape-stripping, the time points that corresponded to the maximum delay in barrier recovery), were fixed directly in modified Karnovsky's fixative, postfixed with reduced osmium tetroxide (OsO4), and then embedded in an Epon-epoxy mixture. For visualization of lipid-enriched, lamellar bilayer structures, some samples were postfixed with ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4). Sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E microtome, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed in a Zeiss 10 CR electron microscope, operated at 60 kV. We first assessed the localization of NHE1 in murine epidermis by immunohistochemistry. As seen in Fig.1 A, NHE1 is present in all epidermal cell layers. Its expression increases in the epidermal outer nucleated cell layers, especially in the apical surface of cells, and disappears in the enucleated cells above the SG-SC interface. Omission of the primary antibody eliminates virtually all epidermal staining (not shown). Immunostaining also is absent in NHE1 knockout (−/−)versus wild-type (+/+) epidermis (Fig. 1, B versus A), demonstrating the specificity of this labeling. These images demonstrate that NHE1 is expressed more abundantly in a suprabasal and apical pattern, consistent with a novel role in extracellular acidification of the SC. Traditional skin surface pH measurements do not reveal detailed information about pH changes deep within the SC, or within specific microdomains (e.g. in the corneocyte interstices). Moreover, tape-stripping to measure pH in deeper levels of the SC, the only method available until now, inevitably disturbs the tissue pH equilibrium. We therefore employed FLIM as a novel method to visualize pH in intact, unperturbed SC (13Hanson K.M. Behne M.J. Barry N.P. Mauro T.M. Gratton E. Clegg R.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1682-1690Google Scholar) and as a function of depth within the outer epidermis of NHE1 knockout mice (Fig.2 B) versus their wild-type littermates (Fig. 2 A). FLIM measurements are dye concentration-independent, are not prone to photobleaching, and offer a look deep into intact tissue (19Masters B.R. So P.T. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2405-2412Google Scholar, 21Tadrous P.J. J. Pathol. 2000; 191: 229-234Google Scholar). This method therefore reveals differential pH changes with great detail, here displayed as pH maps of the SC (13Hanson K.M. Behne M.J. Barry N.P. Mauro T.M. Gratton E. Clegg R.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1682-1690Google Scholar, 20Szmacinski H. Lakowicz J.R. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 1668-1674Google Scholar). Because both surface pH and the slope of SC pH are important in epidermal barrier homeostasis (11Ohman H. Vahlquist A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 674-677Google Scholar), we measured pH at different levels of the SC. The increased spatial resolution of FLIM distinguishes differences in the pH of SC extracellular versus intracellular domains, as well as depth-dependent pH changes, conventionally referred to as the pH gradient (24Ohman H. Vahlquist A. Acta Derm. Venereol. 1994; 74: 375-379Google Scholar). BCECF, the pH-sensitive indicator in these experiments, is used normally as an acetoxymethyl ester for intracellular measurements, because this uncharged molecule (but not the free acid BCECF) can permeate cell membranes (product information, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nevertheless, living cells do not exclude BCECF free acid completely (25Sit K.H. Bay B.H. Wong K.P. Anat. Rec. 1993; 235: 183-190Google Scholar). Using FLIM, we were able to measure the relative amounts of BCECF in the intracellularversus extracellular compartments, and found that BCECF free acid penetrates into cells (the ratio of intracellular to extracellular dye concentration in the SC is ∼1:10), which we attribute to the nature of the SC, i.e. the enucleated corneocytes of this non-viable layer become more permeable and cannot exclude the dye effectively. Additionally, because of the increased sensitivity of FLIM, we also were able to detect BCECF in viable SG cells, albeit in much lower concentrations than seen in SC corneocytes. In wild-type SC, FLIM reveals acidic (∼ pH 6) and neutral (∼ pH 6.8) areas (compare histograms in Fig. 2 A), and the section-individual pH histograms show a change from predominantly acidic to a predominantly neutral pH from the upper to the lower SC (from outward to inward optical sections). Nevertheless, even at a depth that represents the SG-SC interface (6–8 μm), acidity is still present in extracellular microdomains, ensuring an optimal pH for enzymes such as β-Glc-Cer'ase and aSM'ase (6Schmuth M.

Invest. 1999; 104: 1761-1770Google Scholar), which are required for extracellular lipid processing. Because the outline of corneocytes can be seen clearly in the intensity images, intra- and extracellular values are identified through side-by-side comparison of intensity images (left column) and FLIM/pH maps (center column), which allows identification and localization of acidic microdomains to extracellular areas of the SC. Although the acidity of each microdomain is constant, the number of acidic microdomains increases in more superficial layers of the SC. The overall change in pH therefore lies in the number of acidicversus neutral areas (or in the number of acidicversus neutral pixels). In NHE1 −/− mice, the acidic signal is almost completely absent from extracellular membrane domains (Fig. 2 B) in the SC. In essence, the extracellular acidification is blunted in NHE1 −/− SC (Fig. 2, A andB). Using three-dimensional histograms, we find that the acidic spike that corresponds to extracellular acidification starts in the lower SC and increases steadily in the NHE1 +/+ mice. In contrast, this acidic spike is missing completely in the NHE1 −/− mice (Fig. 2 C). The individual FLIM images (Fig. 2,A and B, center column) and the histograms derived from them (Fig. 2, A andB, right column) both demonstrate that the NHE1 is responsible for acidification of extracellular microdomains in SC. To compare NHE1 wild-type and knockout animals further, three independent FLIM experiments per genotype were performed, and the pH of sections for the surface, and of SC/SG level were compared. The two-sided t test for these values confirms that the surface pH on the knockout and wild-type mice are significantly different (Table I). However, the NHE1 −/− pH measurements do not differ when surface and SC/SG interface pH are compared, consistent with an inability to acidify the SC in NHE1 −/− skin to normal levels.Table IComparison of SC pH in NHE1 wild type and knockoutNHE1pHDeviationS.E.ttestSC vs. SGWild-type vs. knockoutWild-typeSC6.180.0410.0290.02SC: 0.01(n = 3)SG6.340.0520.037SG: 0.27KnockoutSC6.380.0470.0330.64(n = 3)SG6.400.0400.028To compare pH changes between NHE1 wild-type and knockout animals statistically, three independent FLIM experiments per genotype were performed, and the pH of sections for the surface, and of SC/SG level were compared.

Open table in a new tab To compare pH changes between NHE1 wild-type and knockout animals statistically, three independent FLIM experiments per genotype were performed, and the pH of sections for the surface, and of SC/SG level were compared. The two-sided t test for these values confirms that the surface pH on the knockout and wild-type mice are significantly different. However, the NHE1 −/− pH measurements do not differ when surface and SC/SG interface pH are compared, consistent with an inability to acidify the SC in NHE1 −/− skin to normal levels. When FLIM was compared with standard flat electrode measurements, we found that many of the changes seen with FLIM were not distinguishable using the flat electrode, which suffers both from lower sensitivity and lower spatial resolution. For example, skin surface pH of NHE1 −/− animals as measured with the flat electrode was only slightly but significantly elevated in comparison to their NHE1 +/+ littermates (pH 6.01 versus pH 5.75, p = 0.02,n = 13 and 15, respectively; compare with Fig. 2). The difference in absolute pH values between FLIM and flat surface pH electrode may also demonstrate the introduction of another artifact, the water necessary to wet the glass electrode, which further reduces the sensitivity of the glass electrode. Because the abnormalities seen with FLIM correlate with functional abnormalities in lipid processing and epidermal barrier repair (see below), we conclude that the flat electrode is not adequate to study some physiologically important changes in SC pH. In summary, comparing epidermal structure via dye distribution with pH distribution maps, acidic pH localizes predominantly to extracellular domains of the SC, and acidity is almost completely absent from extracellular domains of NHE1 −/− SC. To determine the importance of epidermal acidification through NHE1, we next examined its function in epidermal barrier homeostasis of NHE1 −/− mice. Although the −/− animals were somewhat smaller than either their wild-type or heterozygous littermates at the time of weaning and displayed an ataxic gait as part of the reported epilepsy (14Bell S.M. Schreiner C.M. Schultheis P.J. Miller M.L. Evans R.L. Vorhees C.V. Shull G.E. Scott W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C788-C795Google Scholar, 26Bonnet U. Bingmann D. Wiemann M. Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 2000; 10: 97-103Google Scholar), the skin of knockout animals appeared clinically and histologically normal. Transepidermal water loss as a measure of permeability barrier function in −/− mice did not differ from +/+ littermates at base line (data not shown), demonstrating that the smaller size of affected animals did not cause a nonspecific epidermal barrier defect. However, differences in barrier homeostasis between knockout and wild-type animals became apparent after barrier disruption by sequential removal of the outermost SC layers by gentle tape-stripping (Fig.3 a). NHE1 −/− animals had slower barrier recovery, with significant differences at both 5 and 8 h after tape-stripping (−/− animals versus +/+ littermates, p < 0.005, two-tailed t test). Barrier recovery kinetics of NHE1 −/− mice was similar to those of normal, hairless mice treated with the NHE1 inhibitor HOE694 (results below; c.f. Fig.4 a). These results demonstrate that the presence or absence of the NHE1 antiporter has important functional consequences for normal epidermal permeability barrier homeostasis.Figure 4a, effect of pH and NHE1 inhibition on barrier recovery. Hairless mice were tape-stripped to transepidermal water loss of 7–9 g/m2/h and Hilltop chambers with or without HOE694 (7.5 μm) in pH 7.4 or 5.5 HEPES buffer (10 mm) were applied. Control areas were covered with Hilltop chambers containing HEPES buffer (10 mm) of pH 5.5 and 7.4, respectively. Transepidermal water loss was measured at 0, 2, 5, and 24 h following tape-stripping, and the same Hilltop chambers were reapplied immediately following measurements.

We focused on the kinetics of barrier recovery, again assessed as changes in transepidermal water loss rates, after acute barrier perturbations by tape-stripping, followed by exposure to buffers of different pHs with or without added inhibitors. We compared the effects of amiloride as the prototypical NHE inhibitor (27Vigne P. Frelin C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Lazdunski M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 131-136Google Scholar, 28Frelin C. Vigne P. Barbry P. Lazdunski M. Kidney Int. 1987; 32: 785-793Google Scholar) with the highly specific NHE1 inhibitor HOE694 (29Loh S.H. Sun B. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1905-1912Google Scholar) at various doses on permeability barrier homeostasis. When amiloride was applied after tape-stripping in a concentration range, based upon its reported IC50 in fibroblasts (i.e. 5 μm), a significant delay in barrier recovery occurred at 2 and 5 h, with normalization of recovery by 24 h. Although in cell culture and in short term measurements of intracellular pH, 1 μm amiloride is fully inhibitory (1Mauro T. Dixon D.B. Hanley K. Isseroff R.R. Pappone P.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 203-208Google Scholar), the extent of barrier recovery at 24 h may be attributable to the lower specificity for NHE1 (see also the ultrastructural findings below). When HOE694 was applied to acutely disrupted skin sites at 1.5 μm, a significant delay in barrier recovery rates also occurred, which was sustained out to 24 h. A 10-fold increase in HOE694 concentration (to 15 μm) produced a more marked functional abnormality, with only 50% normalization of barrier function at 24 h. The lack of an additional increase in absolute transepidermal water loss levels with the highest concentration tested (i.e. 15 μm) makes a toxic effect highly unlikely (signs of toxicity were also absent by ultrastructural examination; Fig. 4 b). Nevertheless, further experiments, described below (Fig. 4 a), utilized HOE694 at an intermediate concentration (i.e. 7.5 μm). Finally, to establish that the barrier defect is linked to an acidification abnormality, we assessed whether co-applications of an acidic buffer with the inhibitors would normalize barrier recovery. Co-applications of an acidic buffer with HOE694 overrode the effects of the inhibitor alone (Fig. 4 a), demonstrating that the abnormalities in permeability barrier homeostasis are caused by NHE1-inhibitor-induced alterations in SC acidification. The structural basis for the knockout- and inhibitor-induced delays in barrier recovery was assessed by electron microscopy. Because previous st"
https://openalex.org/W2140955387,"Alpha-synuclein (alpha-SN) is a ubiquitous protein that is especially abundant in the brain and has been postulated to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, little is known about the neuronal functions of alpha-SN and the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal loss. Here, we show that alpha-SN plays dual roles of neuroprotection and neurotoxicity depending on its concentration or level of expression. At nanomolar concentrations, a-SN protected neurons against serum deprivation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity through the PI3/Akt signaling pathway, and its protective effect was increased by Bcl-2 overexpression. Conversely, at both low micromolar and overexpressed levels in the cell, alpha-SN resulted in cytotoxicity. This might be related to decreased Bcl-xL expression and increased bax expression, which is subsequently followed by cytochrome c release and caspase activation and also by microglia-mediated inflammatory responses via the NFkappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways."

Because Rab27A and myosin Va are known to be expressed in tissues other than melanocytes, we hypothesized that other linker protein(s) must exist in the body.

We also discovered that the conserved most C-terminal region of Slac2 functions as a novel actin-binding site. Based on our findings, we discuss the role of Slac2 in Rab27A-dependent membrane trafficking. cDNAs encoding the N-terminal region of Slac2-c were amplified from Marathon-Ready adult mouse brain cDNA (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.; Palo Alto, CA) by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) as described previously (20Fukuda M.

https://openalex.org/W2024197468,"Recent liver regeneration studies indicate that maintaining hepatic Forkhead Box M1B (FoxM1B) expression in 12-month-old (old-aged) Transthyretin-FoxM1B transgenic mice increases hepatocyte proliferation and expression of cell cycle regulatory genes. Because these transgenic CD-1 mice maintain FoxM1B levels during the aging process, we conducted the current study to determine whether adenovirus delivery of the FoxM1B gene (AdFoxM1B) is sufficient to stimulate liver regeneration in old-aged Balb/c mice. Here we show that AdFoxM1B infection of old-aged mice caused a significant increase in FoxM1B expression, hepatocyte DNA replication, and mitosis following partial hepatectomy. This stimulation in hepatocyte S-phase progression was associated with diminished protein expression and perinuclear localization of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27Kip1 (p27) protein following partial hepatectomy. In contrast, old-aged mice infected with control virus displayed high hepatocyte levels of p27 protein, which had been localized to the nucleus prior to S-phase. Furthermore, we found that restoring FoxM1B expression did not influence p27 mRNA levels, and this new finding implicates FoxM1B in regulation of p27 protein levels. Likewise, AdFoxM1B-infected regenerating livers displayed elevated S-phase levels of Cdk2 kinase activity compared with old-aged mice infected with control virus. Furthermore, restoring FoxM1B expression in old-aged mice caused elevated levels of Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, Cdc25B, Cdk1, and p55CDC mRNA as well as stimulating Cdc25B nuclear localization during liver regeneration, all of which are required for mitosis. These studies indicated that an acute delivery of the FoxM1B gene in old-aged mice is sufficient to re-establish proliferation of regenerating hepatocytes, suggesting that FoxM1B can be used for therapeutic intervention to alleviate the reduction in cellular proliferation observed in the elderly.

Cell cycle progression is regulated by cyclin expression and degradation as well as by cyclin-mediated activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Formation of the Cyclin E-Cdk2 and Cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes is critical for S-phase entry and progression because they phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (RB) protein, which releases bound E2F transcription factor and allows it to stimulate expression of proliferation-specific target genes (6Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Likewise, Cyclin B proteins associate with Cdk1 (Cdc2) to mediate cell cycle progression from the G2 phase into mitosis (7Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cdk activity is stimulated through dephosphorylation by the Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C phosphatase proteins (8Nilsson I. Hoffmann I. Prog.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5158) Google Scholar). Finally, increased p55CDC protein levels are required to regulate the ubiquitin-ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC)-mediated degradation of the Cyclin B proteins, whose elimination is required for the completion of mitosis (7Zachariae W.

In regenerating liver, increased hepatic expression of FoxM1B levels occurs at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (32 h post-PHx), and its levels remain elevated throughout the period of proliferation (19Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Ye H. Kelly T.F. Samadani U. Lim L. Rubio S. Overdier D.G. Roebuck K.A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1626-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To examine the role of FoxM1B in regulating cellular proliferation, we developed transgenic (TG) CD-1 mice in which the −3-kb Transthyretin (TTR) promoter was used to drive hepatocyte expression of the human FoxM1B (HFH-11B) cDNA (19Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Using these TG mice for liver regeneration studies, we found that premature FoxM1B expression caused an 8-h acceleration of hepatocyte entry into S-phase and mitosis and earlier expression of genes involved in regulating cell cycle progression (19Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Wang X. Hung N.-J. Costa R.H. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1404-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that diminished expression of FoxM1B and its cell cycle target genes is associated with reduced proliferation in regenerating hepatocytes of 12-month-old (old-aged) CD-1 mice (18Wang X. Quail E. Hung N.-J. Tan Y., Ye, H. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11468-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and in proliferating human fibroblasts of the elderly (23Ly D.H. Lockhart D.J. Lerner R.A. Schultz P.G. Science. 2000; 287: 2486-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Maintaining FoxM1B expression in regenerating liver of old-aged TTR-FoxM1B TG mice is sufficient to increase hepatocyte DNA synthesis and mitosis to levels found in young (2-month-old) regenerating mouse liver (18Wang X. Quail E. Hung N.-J. Tan Y., Ye, H. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11468-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FoxM1B-mediated stimulation of hepatocyte proliferation was associated with increased expression of numerous cell cycle regulatory genes. These include increased expression of S-phase promoting Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A2 and M-phase promoting Cyclin F, Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, Cdc25B, and p55CDC (18Wang X. Quail E. Hung N.-J. Tan Y., Ye, H. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11468-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Taken together, these published studies supported the hypothesis that maintaining FoxM1B levels will prevent age related decrease in cellular proliferation. In this study, we showed that regenerating livers of old-aged Balb/c mice exhibited diminished FoxM1B expression with significant reductions in hepatocyte proliferation, increased levels of the S-phase inhibitor p27Kip1 (p27) protein, and reduced expression of the M-phase promoting CyclinA2, Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, Cdc25B, Cdk1, and p55CDC genes. We demonstrated that an adenovirus-mediated increase in FoxM1B expression (AdFoxM1B) significantly elevated hepatocyte proliferation in regenerating liver of old-aged Balb/c mice, which was associated with diminished nuclear expression of the p27 protein and restoring levels of these M-phase progression genes. To create the adenovirus expressing FoxM1B (AdFoxM1B), we subcloned the 2.7-kbEcoRI-HindIII fragment of the human FoxM1B cDNA into the adenovirus shuttle vector pGEMCMV NEW (a gift from J. R. Nevins, Duke University, Durham, NC). This adenovirus shuttle vector and the overlapping adenovirus genome were transfected into 293 cells and homologous recombination was used to generate AdFoxM1B as described previously (24Schwarz J.K. Bassing C.H. Kovesdi I. Datto M.B. Blazing M. George S. Wang X.F. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Replication-defective adenovirus, which was deleted in the E1 genes (AdEmpty), was a gift from P. Raychaudhuri (University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL). Recombinant adenoviruses were used to infect QBO-293 cells (Quantum Biotechnologies, Montreal, Canada), and cell lysates were harvested at 72 h post infection. Adenovirus particles were purified from this cell lysate by CsCl centrifugation and dialyzed to remove the CsCl as described previously (25Tan Y. Costa R.H. Kovesdi I. Reichel R.R. Gene Expr. 2001; 9: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Tan Y. Hughes D.E. Wang X. Costa R.H. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Two days prior to the PHx operation, 12-month-old Balb/c mice (purchased from the National Institutes of Aging, Bethesda, MD) were subjected to tail vein injection with 200 μl of either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; mock-infected) or PBS containing 1 × 1011 purified adenovirus particles (AdFoxM1B or AdEmpty). Two days after infection, all the Balb/c mice were subjected to PHx to induce liver regeneration as described previously (18Wang X. Quail E. Hung N.-J. Tan Y., Ye, H. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11468-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 19Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Three mice at each time point were sacrificed using CO2 asphyxiation at the following intervals after PHx: 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44 h. An intraperitoneal injection of a PBS solution containing 10 mg/ml of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Sigma; 50 μg/g body weight) was administered 2 h prior to harvesting the remnant regenerating liver. The regenerating livers were harvested and divided into three portions: one to isolate total RNA (19Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), one to isolate total protein extract (27Rausa F.M. Tan Y. Zhou H. Yoo K. Stolz D.B. Watkins S. Franks R.R. Unterman T.G. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8264-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and one utilized for paraffin embedding (28Rausa F.M., Ye, H. Lim L. Duncan S.A. Costa R.H. Methods. 1998; 16: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Determination of the number of hepatocytes undergoing DNA synthesis was performed by monoclonal antibody detection of BrdUrd incorporation (Roche) of regenerating liver (5-μm paraffin sections) using the microwave antigen retrieval method described previously (19Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Using three regenerating livers per time point, we counted the number of BrdUrd-positive nuclei per 1000 hepatocytes to calculate the mean number of BrdUrd-positive cells (± S.D.) as described previously (19Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Three regenerating liver sections at 36, 40, and 44 h post-PHx were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and examined for mitotic figures (mitosis). Hepatocyte mitosis is expressed as the mean of the number of mitotic figures found per 1000 hepatocytes ± S.D. as described previously (19Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Adenovirus-infected and mock-infected mice undergoing liver regeneration were given free access to food and water. The FoxM1B (HFH-11B) antibody specific to the amino terminus (19Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Ye H. Kelly T.F. Samadani U. Lim L. Rubio S. Overdier D.G. Roebuck K.A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1626-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), p27 antibody (Cell Signaling, Berkeley, CA), or Cdc25B antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used for immunohistochemical detection of paraffin-embedded 5 μm sections of regenerating liver using methods described previously (19Ye H. Holterman A. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Ye H. Kelly T.F. Samadani U. Lim L. Rubio S. Overdier D.G. Roebuck K.A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1626-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Prior to FoxM1B immunohistochemical staining, regenerating liver sections were subjected to a 15-min proteinase K antigen retrieval step (20 μg/ml Proteinase K, Invitrogen) in PBS at room temperature and then rinsed in PBS. For Western blot analysis, 50 μg of total liver protein (27Rausa F.M. Tan Y. Zhou H. Yoo K. Stolz D.B. Watkins S. Franks R.R. Unterman T.G. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8264-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Protran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). The signal from the primary p27Kip1antibody (Cell Signaling) was amplified by biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and signals were detected with Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus (ECL-plus, AmershamBiosciences). Cdk2 kinase assays were performed by immunoprecipitation of active Cdk2 enzyme from 200 μg of total liver protein with Cdk2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology.) and Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and nonspecific proteins were removed by repetitive washes as described in Kiyokawa et al.(29Kiyokawa H. Kineman R.D. Manova-Todorova K.O. Soares V.C. Hoffman E.S. Ono M. Khanam D. Hayday A.C. Frohman L.A. Koff A. Cell. 1996; 85: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). The Cdk2 kinase reaction involved addition of the Rb protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with [γ-32P]ATP to immunoprecipitated Cdk2 protein bound to the Protein A-Sepharose beads. The kinase reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and one-half of the Cdk2 kinase reaction was separated by SDS/PAGE and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. Quantitation of Cdk2-mediated Rb phosphorylation was performed with the Storm 860 PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant program (AmershamBiosciences). Total RNA was prepared from mouse liver at indicated hours post-PHx using RNA-STAT-60 (Tel-Test “B” Inc., Friendswood, TX) and used for RNase protection assays with antisense [α-32P]UTP-labeled probes specific to cell cycle regulatory genes as described previously (18Wang X. Quail E. Hung N.-J. Tan Y., Ye, H. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11468-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 22Wang X. Hung N.-J. Costa R.H. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1404-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 600-nucleotide mouse p27 cDNA (a gift from H. Kiyokawa) was digested withAvaII, and a 200-nucleotide antisense RNA probe was synthesized from this template. RNase protection assay gels were also exposed to phosphorimaging screens for 1 or 2 days and scanned with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and quantitated with the ImageQuant program. Expression levels were normalized to either cyclophilin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels. Mean mRNA levels ± S.D. were determined from three distinct regenerating livers. Maintaining hepatocyte FoxM1B levels in 12-month-old (old-aged) TTR-FoxM1B TG CD-1 mice stimulated both proliferation of regenerating hepatocytes and expression of cell cycle regulatory genes (18Wang X. Quail E. Hung N.-J. Tan Y., Ye, H. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11468-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Because these TG CD-1 mice sustained FoxM1B expression throughout the aging process, we sought to determine whether an acute adenovirus-mediated delivery of hepatic FoxM1B protein (AdFoxM1B) to old-aged Balb/c mice would stimulate proliferation of regenerating hepatocytes. To avoid the initial acute phase response to viral infection, which subsides within 36 h following adenovirus infection (30Benihoud K. Salone B. Esselin S. Opolon P. Poli V., Di Giovine M. Perricaudet M. Saggio I. J. Gene Med. 2000; 2: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we chose to perform the PHx two days after adenovirus infection. 12-month-old (old-aged) Balb/c mice were infected with either replication-defective control adenovirus (AdEmpty) or AdFoxM1B by tail vein injection and then subjected to PHx operations two days later. The remnant regenerating livers were harvested at different intervals between 24 and 44 h following surgery for analysis of hepatocyte proliferation and expression of cell cycle genes. Hepatocyte DNA synthesis was monitored by immunohistochemical staining of BrdUrd incorporation into DNA as described previously (18Wang X. Quail E. Hung N.-J. Tan Y., Ye, H. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11468-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). RNase protection assays with regenerating liver RNA demonstrated that only AdFoxM1B-infected old-aged mice exhibited increased hepatic FoxM1B mRNA that resembled levels observed with young (2-month-old) mouse liver at 40 h after PHx (Fig.1 A). AdFoxM1B infection of old-aged mice increased the peak of regenerating hepatocyte DNA replication and mitosis (Fig. 1, B and C) compared with mock-infected (MI) or AdEmpty-infected adenovirus controls (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, AdFoxM1B-infected old-aged mice displayed an 8-h acceleration in the peak of hepatocyte DNA replication occurring at 32 h post-PHx (Fig. 1 B, red line) compared with a DNA replication peak at 40 h after PHx found with young regenerating liver (Fig. 1 B, black line). This accelerated DNA replication peak was associated with earlier hepatocyte FoxM1B nuclear staining at 24 h post-PHx (Fig.2 A) compared with 36–40 h post-PHx for young regenerating mouse liver (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, no FoxM1B nuclear staining was found in either MI- or AdEmpty-infected old-aged mouse controls (Fig. 2, C andD). These results suggest that earlier FoxM1B nuclear staining is associated with accelerated hepatocyte DNA replication in regenerating liver of AdFoxM1B-infected old-aged mice.Figure 2Regenerating liver of AdFoxM1B-infected old-aged mice displayed earlier nuclear FoxM1B staining.Regenerating liver sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with an amino-terminal FoxM1B antibody. This includes regenerating liver from either AdFoxM1B-infected 12-month-old (12 M) (A), mock-infected (MI) 2-month-old (B), MI 12-month-old (C), or AdEmpty-infected 12-month-old (D) Balb/c mice.

Magnification for panels A, C, and Dare 400× and panel B is 630×.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The p27Kip1 (p27) protein associates with Cdk2 and inhibits kinase activity of the Cyclin E-Cdk2 and Cyclin A2-Cdk2 complexes (11Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5158) Google Scholar). S-phase progression requires Cyclin-Cdk2 protein phosphorylation of the RB protein, which causes dissociation of RB and activates the E2F transcription factor (6Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Because the related FoxO1 and FoxO3 (previously called FKHR) transcription factors are known to stimulate expression of p27 (31Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar), we next examined whether AdFoxM1B infection could influence expression of the p27 protein. We subjected regenerating liver protein extracts to Western blot analysis using a commercially available p27 antibody (Fig.3). These data demonstrated that either MI- or AdEmpty-infected old-aged mice displayed an elevated expression of p27 protein (Fig. 3, B and D), whereas reduced hepatic p27 levels were found in both young mice and AdFoxM1B-infected old-aged mice following PHx (Fig. 3, A and C). Interestingly, we found that AdFoxM1B infection did not alter p27 mRNA levels (Fig. 3, E and F), suggesting that FoxM1B is regulating p27 protein levels rather than controlling its promoter activity. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of regenerating liver sections demonstrated that MI- and AdEmpty-infected old-aged mice displayed abundant p27 nuclear staining prior to S-phase (Fig. 4, A, B,D, and E). In contrast, AdFoxM1B-infected old-aged mice displayed only perinuclear hepatocyte staining of p27 protein following PHx (Fig. 4, G–I), a finding consistent with stimulating S-phase progression (11Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although MI- and AdEmpty-infected old-aged mice displayed perinuclear staining of p27 protein at 40 h post-PHx (Fig. 4, C andF), this delayed change in p27 cellular localization was unable to facilitate S-phase progression. Collectively, these liver regeneration studies suggest that FoxM1B mediates S-phase progression in old-aged mice by diminishing nuclear expression of the p27 protein.Figure 4AdFoxM1B-infected old-aged mice display perinuclear p27 staining in regenerating hepatocytes. Regenerating liver sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with a p27 antibody. This includes regenerating liver from either MI 12-month-old (A–C), AdEmpty-infected 12-month-old (D–F), or AdFoxM1B-infected 12-month-old (G–I) Balb/c mice. Shown are regenerating liver sections isolated at 24 or 28, 36, and 40 h following PHx. Note that the DNA replication peak occurs at 32 h post-PHx in AdFoxM1B-infected old-aged mice, whereas it occurs at 40 h post-PHx in either MI- or AdEmpty-infected old-aged mice.Arrows indicate representative p27 staining, which is either nuclear in MI- and AdEmpty-infected old-aged mice or perinuclear in AdFoxM1B-infected mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine whether diminished p27 protein levels were associated with increased Cdk2 kinase activity, regenerating liver protein extracts prepared from either AdEmpty- or AdFoxM1B-infected old-aged mice were immunoprecipitated with Cdk2 antibody and then used to phosphorylate recombinant RB protein. These experiments demonstrated that diminished S-phase levels of p27 protein were associated with elevated Cdk2 kinase activity in AdFoxM1B-infected regenerating liver (Fig.5 B) compared with AdEmpty-infected controls (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that AdFoxM1B infection of old-aged mice diminished nuclear expression of p27 protein in regenerating hepatocytes, which allowed complex formation of the active Cyclin E-Cdk2 and Cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes required for S-phase progression. RNase protection assays were performed in triplicate with cell cycle regulatory gene probes, and regenerating liver RNA was isolated between 24 and 44 h following PHx (Fig.6, A–D). In 2-month-old (young) regenerating mouse liver, increased S-phase levels of Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin B2 mRNA occurred at 40 h post-PHx (Fig. 6, E–G). We found that regenerating liver of AdFoxM1B-infected old-aged mice displayed increased S-phase levels of Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin B2 mRNA at 32 h post-PHx (Fig. 6, E–G) compared with either MI- or AdEmpty-infected old-aged mouse controls (Fig. 6, E–G). Furthermore, expression levels of these genes diminished during mitosis, which occurred at 36 h following PHx (Fig. 6, E–G). In addition, expression of mitosis promoting Cdc25B phosphatase, Cdk1, and p55CDC mRNA initiated prior to S-phase between 32 and 36 h following PHx in young regenerating liver (Fig.7 B, arrow). Likewise, AdFoxM1B-infected regenerating liver initiated expression of Cdc25B, p55CDC, and Cdk1 mRNA prior to S-phase at 24 h after PHx (Fig. 7 D, arrow), whereas these mRNA levels were diminished in regenerating liver of either MI- or AdEmpty-infected old-aged mouse controls (Fig. 7, A andC). Immunohistochemical staining of regenerating liver sections revealed a biphasic nuclear staining of Cdc25B phosphatase protein prior to and following S-phase (Fig.8, D–F), a finding consistent with the ability of Cdc25B to activate Cdk1 as required for M-phase progression (8Nilsson I. Hoffmann I. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 9Sebastian B. Kakizuka A. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, low levels of either nuclear or perinuclear hepatocyte staining of Cdc25B protein were found at 28 h post-PHx in AdEmpty-infected old-aged liver (Fig.8 A). Furthermore, only perinuclear hepatocyte staining of the Cdc25B protein was found at later time points following PHx (Fig.8, A–C, and data not shown). These results suggest that FoxM1B-stimulated proliferation of regenerating hepatocytes is associated with increased expression of S-phase promoting Cyclin A genes and M-phase promoting Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, Cdc25B, and p55CDC genes.Figure 7Increased Cdc25B, p55CDC, and Cdk1 mRNA levels during liver regeneration of AdFoxM1B-infected old-aged mice. Total RNA was isolated from regenerating liver and analyzed for RNA expression by RNase protection assays (in triplicate) with Cdc25B, p55CDC, and Cdk1 probes. This includes regenerating liver from MI 12-month-old (A), MI 2-month-old (B), AdEmpty-infected 12-month-old (C), or AdFoxM1B-infected 12-month old (D) Balb/c mice. Note that representative duplicate samples are shown. Expression levels were normalized to cyclophilin internal control. The relative fold induction of expression is indicated below the panels for Cdk1. Expression levels of the MI 2-month-old regenerating mouse liver at 24 h post-PHx were set at 1.0. Note that Cdc25B and p55CDC levels were undetectable in regenerating livers from either MI- or AdEmpty-infected 12-month-old mice.

Quail E. Hung N.-J. Tan Y., Ye, H. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11468-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that AdFoxM1B infection of old-aged mice prior to PHx elevated FoxM1B expression levels and increased hepatocyte DNA replication and mitosis compared with either MI- or AdEmpty-infected controls. This stimulation in hepatocyte S-phase progression was associated with diminished expression of the Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 (p27) protein and sustained perinuclear staining of the p27 protein. In contrast, old-aged mice infected with control virus displayed high hepatocyte levels of p27 protein, which had been localized to the nucleus prior to S-phase. Interestingly, we found that AdFoxM1B infection did not alter p27 mRNA levels, a new result demonstrating that FoxM1B participates in regulating nuclear expression of the p27 protein rather than controlling its promoter expression. Furthermore, we found increased S-phase levels of Cyclin A2 mRNA and Cdk2 kinase activity, both of which are consistent with enhanced hepatocyte DNA replication (7Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 11Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5158) Google Scholar). Moreover, AdFoxM1B infection of old-aged mice caused elevated expression of Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, Cdc25B, Cdk1, and p55CDC mRNA in regenerating livers, all of which are required for mitosis (7Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Finally, we showed that increased FoxM1B levels in regenerating old-aged hepatocytes enhanced nuclear staining of Cdc25B protein, a phosphatase, which stimulated Cdk1 activity required for entry into mitosis (8Nilsson I.

These studies indicated that an acute delivery of FoxM1B gene in old-aged mice was sufficient to re-establish regenerating hepatocyte proliferation, suggesting that FoxM1B is a candidate for therapeutic intervention to ameliorate diminished proliferation observed in the elderly. Activation of Cdk activity through the formation of CyclinD1-Cdk 4/6 and Cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes is required to phosphorylate the RB protein and mediate release of the E2F transcription factor to activate expression of its proliferation-specific target genes (6Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Unlike liver regeneration studies with old-aged wild type and TG CD-1 mice (18Wang X. Quail E. Hung N.-J. Tan Y., Ye, H. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11468-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we did not find significant differences in Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E expression between old-aged and young Balb/c mice. However, AdFoxM1B infection was able to stimulate S-phase levels of Cyclin A2 mRNA and diminish nuclear expression of the p27 protein, which was elevated in old-aged mouse liver (Figs. 3 and 4). A transient reduction in p27 protein levels is required for activation of Cyclin E-Cdk2 and Cyclin A2-Cdk2 kinase complex, which is essential to mediate progression into S-phase through maintenance of RB phosphorylation and E2F transcriptional activity (6Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, AdFoxM1B-infected regenerating liver displayed increased S-phase Cdk2 activity using the RB protein substrate compared with AdEmpty-infected old-aged mouse controls. Moreover, the active Cyclin A2-Cdk2 kinase complex is required to phosphorylate the cdh1 subunit of the ubiquitin-ligase APC, which prevents APC-mediated degradation of Cyclin B at the end of S-phase and thus allows Cyclin B accumulation to promote entry into mitosis (6Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). More recent studies demonstrate that in proliferating mammalian cells the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signal transduction pathway is essential for G1 to S-phase progression because it prevents transcriptional activity of the FoxO1 and FoxO3 (previously called FKHR) proteins, which stimulate transcription of the Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 gene (31Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Activation of the PI3K signaling pathway stimulates the Akt kinase, which phosphorylates the C-terminus of the FoxO1 (Fkhr; Daf-16) protein and mediates its nuclear export into the cytoplasm, thus preventing FoxO1 transcriptional activation of target genes (32Biggs III, W.H.

Unlike the FoxO protein, whose transcriptional inhibition is required for cell cycle progression, elevated FoxM1B expression mediates S-phase progression by diminishing nuclear expression of the p27 protein. Interestingly, increased FoxM1B expression did not alter p27 mRNA levels, indicating that FoxM1B regulates p27 protein levels rather than influencing its promoter activity. During G1 phase of the cell cycle, the p27 protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation, which mediates association with the Jab1 protein, which mediates p27 nuclear export using a CRM1-dependent mechanism and its subsequent proteosome-mediated degradation (35Hara T.

Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we find that restoring FoxM1B expression causes perinuclear hepatocyte staining of the p27 protein in old-aged regenerating liver. It is therefore tempting to speculate that FoxM1B causes diminished p27 protein levels through CRM-1-mediated p27 nuclear export and degradation. Previous co-transfection studies in tissue culture cells demonstrated that FoxM1B over-expression could activate transcription of the Cyclin D1 and Cyclin B1 promoters (18Wang X. Quail E. Hung N.-J. Tan Y., Ye, H. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11468-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our present study shows, for the first time, that FoxM1B is capable of directly or indirectly regulating nuclear expression of the p27 protein, which potentiates formation of the Cyclin-Cdk2 complexes required to stimulate hepatocyte S-phase progression. Consistent with our previous liver regeneration studies in old-aged TG mice, increased FoxM1B levels stimulated expression of M-phase promoting Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, and Cdk1 genes. Cyclin B proteins associate with Cdk1 to mediate cell cycle progression from the G2 phase into mitosis (7Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AdFoxM1B infection of regenerating old-aged liver increased expression of Cdc25B and p55CDC genes, which was undetectable in either MI- or AdEmpty-infected controls. Elevated FoxM1B levels were associated with increased Cdc25B nuclear staining of regenerating hepatocytes, a new finding consistent with stimulating M-phase progression. The Cdc25B phosphatase promotes M-phase progression by dephosphorylation of the Cdk1 Tyr-15 and Thr-14 residues, thereby activating the mitotic Cdk1/Cyclin B kinase (8Nilsson I. Hoffmann I. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 9Sebastian B. Kakizuka A. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microinjection of the Cdc25B protein, but not the Cdc25C protein, can drive replicating cells into mitosis, suggesting that Cdc25B regulates entry into mitosis (39Karlsson C. Katich S. Hagting A. Hoffmann I. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The fact that increased FoxM1B levels re-established appropriate increased expression of Cdc25B is consistent with the ability of FoxM1B to restore mitosis in regenerating liver of old-aged mice. Finally, FoxM1B-mediated increase in p55CDC levels is required to exit mitosis through its regulation of the ubiquitin-ligase APC degradation of the Cyclin proteins (7Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In summary, reduced expression of the FoxM1B transcription factor contributes to the decline in regenerating hepatocyte proliferation observed in old-aged mice. We show that adenovirus delivery of the FoxM1B gene was sufficient to restore FoxM1B expression and stimulated hepatocyte proliferation in regenerating liver of old-aged mice. Increased FoxM1B levels diminished nuclear p27 levels and stimulated expression of the necessary cell cycle regulatory genes. We thank H.

https://openalex.org/W1823710748,"The anemia of chronic inflammatory and malignant diseases is partly due to impaired synthesis of the hormone erythropoietin (Epo). The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) suppress in vitro Epo gene expression and Epo protein secretion. However, the molecular mechanisms of this inhibition are poorly understood. The human Epo promoter and the 5' flanking region contain several recognition sequences for transcription factors acting either positively or negatively. Herein, we investigated the roles of the transcription factors GATA-2 and NF-kappaB in the modulation of Epo gene expression by IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed increased GATA-2 and NF-kappaB DNA binding in cells treated with IL-1beta or TNF-alpha. Reporter gene assays with a sequence from the Epo promoter in front of the firefly luciferase gene showed that the cytokines reduced Epo reporter gene activity. Functional inactivation of GATA-2 and NF-kappaB by oligo-decoy techniques prevented the inhibition of Epo production by IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. In HepG2 cells stably transfected with a dominant-negative form of IkappaBalpha, the activation of NF-kappaB was inhibited, while Epo mRNA levels and Epo secretion increased. Thus, both GATA-2 and NF-kappaB seem to be involved in the suppression of Epo gene expression by IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in vitro and may be responsible for impaired Epo synthesis in inflammatory diseases in vivo."

Activation of these GTPases is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which promote GDP to GTP exchange. In this study we have characterized XPLN, a Rho family GEF.

Within the Ras superfamily, the members of the Rho family regulate an assortment of downstream effectors, and thereby control a diverse set of cellular functions including endocytosis, polarity, adhesion, spreading, and migration (1Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). Rho proteins can also regulate cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, and aberrant Rho GTPase activation has been implicated in oncogenesis and metastasis (2Pruitt K. Der C.J. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Signaling pathways that are mediated by Rho family proteins are crucial for dynamic cellular functions. Accordingly, the activities of these GTPases are tightly regulated (3Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Like other Ras superfamily GTPases, Rho proteins are active when bound to GTP and are inactivated upon hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. GTPase activating proteins stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity to promote formation of inactive Rho-GDP (4Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Conversely, Rho proteins are activated upon association with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 that promote GDP/GTP exchange. Rho family GEFs (also called Dbl family proteins) contain a Dbl homology (DH) domain, which is responsible for the catalytic activity, in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The function of the PH domains is not entirely clear, but it is thought to target GEFs to the plasma membrane and provide a site for regulation by phospholipids (3Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). When GEFs bind to Rho proteins they catalyze the release of GDP by stabilizing the nucleotide-free or “empty pocket” state. GTP then spontaneously binds and renders these proteins active. In the GTP-bound conformation, Rho proteins interact with and stimulate the activity of numerous downstream effectors. Each Rho family GTPase utilizes distinct, as well as shared, effectors that contribute to their distinct cellular functions.Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA are the most thoroughly understood members of the Rho family. Among the best characterized function of these proteins is their regulation of distinct facets of the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton. Cdc42 and Rac1 stimulate the formation of protrusive structures known as filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively (5Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 6Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar, 7Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). These protrusive structures allow cells to physically extend into new areas, and are accordingly found at the leading edge of migrating cells (1Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). Activated RhoA stimulates the formation of focal adhesions and contractile bundles of actin and myosin, known as stress fibers (8Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). Induction of these structures is mediated by the RhoA effectors mDia and the Rho kinases, ROKα/ROCK2 and ROKβ/ROCK1 (9Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J.

In the majority of these situations, Rho GTPase activation is achieved by stimulus-induced activation of a Rho GEF. Whereas some Rho GEFs are highly specific, others are more promiscuous and activate multiple Rho GTPases (3Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Consequently, because each Rho GTPase serves distinct roles in controlling cellular processes, elucidating the precise Rho GTPase specificity of a particular Rho GEF is crucial to understand its function in the regulation of cell behavior.Although RhoA has been the most intensively studied, RhoB and RhoC are highly related proteins that share over 85% amino acid identity with RhoA. Therefore, it is not surprising that these proteins share related functions and regulation. However, there is evidence that they also facilitate distinct cellular functions. For example, RhoB has been shown to exhibit a growth inhibitory function that is not seen with RhoA (12Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RhoC, but not RhoA or RhoB, overexpression has been observed in a variety of human cancers and was shown to enhance tumor cell invasion and metastasis (13Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 14van Golen K.L., Wu, Z.F. Qiao X.T. Bao L.W. Merajver S.D.

Pathol. 2002; 160: 579-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). When tested, Rho GEFs that activate RhoA have also activated RhoB and RhoC. Rho GEFs that selectively activate RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC have as yet not been described.While the spectrum and diversity of extracellular signals that cause activation of Rho GTPases continue to grow at a remarkable pace, the identity of the Rho GEFs that link these signals to Rho GTPases is amazingly quite limited. To better understand how Rho GTPase activity is regulated by extracellular signals, we have characterized the product of the ARHGEF3 gene, a Rho family GEF henceforth called XPLN. XPLN is expressed in brain, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, platelets, and macrophages. We demonstrate by several criteria that in vitro and in vivo XPLN stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange on RhoA and RhoB, but not RhoC or other Rho family GTPases. We show that the inability of XPLN to exchange RhoC is mediated by isoleucine 43, a position occupied by valine in RhoA and RhoB.DISCUSSIONUnderstanding the specificity of Rho family GEFs is crucial for appreciating the biological roles of these proteins. In the present study, we have characterized the Dbl family Rho exchange factor XPLN. Our data indicate that XPLN protein expression is limited to the brain, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, platelets, and macrophages. We show that in vitro and in vivo this GEF specifically associates with and activates the RhoA subfamily GTPases RhoA and RhoB, but not RhoC. Importantly, XPLN is the first described Rho regulatory protein that discriminates between members of the RhoA subfamily. In agreement with its regulation of RhoA and RhoB, XPLN stimulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in a Rho kinase-dependent manner. Like other Rho GEFs and activated mutants of Rho proteins (2Pruitt K. Der C.J. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), XPLN expression is sufficient to cause transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.Given that the members of the RhoA subfamily share 85% overall sequence identity, with RhoA and RhoC being 92% identical, a surprising result of this study was that XPLN activates RhoA and RhoB but not RhoC. Based on amino acid sequence alignments, we focused on the amino acid at position 43 in the RhoA subfamily as a possible determinant in the differential activation of RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC. This position is an isoleucine in RhoC, but is occupied by a less bulky valine in RhoA and RhoB. In agreement with this position serving an important function in exchange by XPLN, a I43V mutation in RhoC rendered it a substrate for this GEF. Additionally, a V43I mutation in RhoB significantly and specifically reduced XPLN-stimulated nucleotide exchange. However, the V43I mutation in RhoB and RhoA did not abolish XPLN exchange and the I43V mutation in RhoC did not restore XPLN-induced nucleotide incorporation to the levels observed with wild type RhoA and RhoB, indicating that there are other residues in the Rho proteins and in XPLN that participate in substrate specificity.One candidate residue in XPLN that may confer specificity is aspartic acid 257. The corresponding residues in the GEFs intersectin (leucine 1376), Tiam1 (isoleucine 1187), and Dbs (leucine 766) are thought to play an important role in governing the specificity of exchange (28Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In LARG and VAV2, which possess exchange activity for RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC (this study), the positions analogous to aspartic acid 257 in XPLN are held by uncharged residues (proline 931 in LARG and valine 330 in VAV2). This position is also occupied by uncharged residues (prolines, leucines, isoleucines, or valines) in nearly all GEFs with activity toward RhoA, such as Lbc, Lfc, Lsc, Trio, and Tim (28Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The presence of a charged aspartic acid in this position may be incompatible for XPLN association and exchange on RhoC, but not RhoA or RhoB. Only one other characterized RhoA GEF, NET1, has an aspartic acid at the equivalent position (residue 255, see Fig. 1). In future studies, it will be interesting to determine whether NET1, like XPLN, stimulates GTP incorporation into RhoA and RhoB, but fails to exchange RhoC.The members of the RhoA subfamily all stimulate the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion and are assumed to couple to a similar set of downstream effectors. Of the members of the RhoA subfamily, RhoB appears to be the most divergent with respect to primary structure, subcellular localization, and function (34Prendergast G.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). RhoB predominantly localizes to intracellular membranes, whereas RhoA and RhoC are largely cytoplasmic and plasma membrane-bound (35Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 36Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Although all members of the RhoA subfamily are capable of transforming cells (2Pruitt K. Der C.J. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), RhoB can also inhibit tumor growth in some cases (12Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). With regards to RhoC, recent studies have suggested that it possesses some unique characteristics. Increased RhoC expression has been observed in metastatic melanoma cells and transformed mammary epithelial cells, and overexpression is sufficient for induction of metastasis (13Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 14van Golen K.L., Wu, Z.F. Qiao X.T. Bao L.W. Merajver S.D.

Pathol. 2002; 160: 579-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In agreement with thein vivo data, RhoC overexpression was observed to enhance cell migration and invasion in tissue culture cells (13Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). These findings mark a distinction from RhoA, which antagonizes migration in several cell types (37Allen W.E. Zicha D. Ridley A.J. Jones G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 38Stam J.C. Michiels F. van der Kammen R.A. Moolenaar W.H. Collard J.G.

Sahai and Marshall (42Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) demonstrated that RhoC is also more effective than RhoA at disrupting adherens junctions, a hallmark of epithelial cell transformation, through Rho kinase-mediated contractility.In the light of these described functional differences between the RhoA subfamily members, it is interesting that only a few differences in regulation and downstream signaling have been proposed. The only previously described difference is that RhoC was suggested to bind Rho kinase more efficiently than RhoA (42Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). With most RhoA subfamily regulators and effectors, however, the binding and effects on the three family members have not been studied. Our finding that XPLN activates RhoA and RhoB but not RhoC is interesting given the oncogenic and differential morphogenic properties of RhoC. It is plausible to think that there are cellular events where an activation of RhoA and/or RhoB is required but where the activation of RhoC could be disadvantageous. Furthermore, the relatively weak transforming activity of XPLN, compared with several other RhoA subfamily GEFs (17Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), might be because of lack of RhoC activation. Future studies will address this, and determine whether there are other RhoA subfamily GEFs with differential preferences among the three RhoA subfamily members.The catalytic activity of many GEFs is negatively regulated by sequences NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal to the DH domain (3Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Consequently, truncation mutants of GEFs are often constitutively active. However, whereas NH2- and COOH-terminal truncations in XPLN do not have any major effects on its ability to activate RhoA in transiently overexpressed conditions (data not shown), the truncations strongly reduce XPLN transforming activity in stable overexpression conditions. In contrast, truncations of NET1, the closest homolog of XPLN, have enhanced transforming activity (25Chan A.M. Takai S. Yamada K. Miki T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the intrinsic activity of XPLN is not negatively regulated by intramolecular interactions, but instead that XPLN is regulated by expression or by sequestration into specific subcellular compartments. Expression of the related protein NET1 has been found to be regulated at the level of gene transcription (43Shen X., Li, J., Hu, P.P. Waddell D. Zhang J. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15362-15368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Unlike NET1, XPLN/Arhgef3 is not regulated by nuclear-cytosolic shuttling (44Schmidt A. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14581-14588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Clearly, elucidation of the mechanisms of XPLN regulation awaits further characterization. Our observation that XPLN is expressed in only a limited number of tissues and specialized cell types could serve to clarify the signaling pathways and biological functions mediated by this exchange factor. For example, XPLN protein was detected in a macrophage cell line and could possibly participate in RhoA-dependent phagocytosis by these cells (45Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). XPLN is also expressed in platelets. An essential role for RhoA has recently been described in the ability of platelet integrin αIIbβ3 to maintain adhesion under shear stress (46Schoenwaelder S.M. Hughan S.C. Boniface K. Fernando S. Holdsworth M. Thompson P.E. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14738-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We are currently examining the role of XPLN in regulating the integrity of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion in platelets and other cells types, as well as its regulation in vivo. The Ras superfamily of small GTPases serve as molecular switches, relaying biochemical signals from extracellular stimuli to elicit intracellular responses that ultimately give rise to changes in cell behavior. Within the Ras superfamily, the members of the Rho family regulate an assortment of downstream effectors, and thereby control a diverse set of cellular functions including endocytosis, polarity, adhesion, spreading, and migration (1Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). Rho proteins can also regulate cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, and aberrant Rho GTPase activation has been implicated in oncogenesis and metastasis (2Pruitt K. Der C.J. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways that are mediated by Rho family proteins are crucial for dynamic cellular functions. Accordingly, the activities of these GTPases are tightly regulated (3Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Like other Ras superfamily GTPases, Rho proteins are active when bound to GTP and are inactivated upon hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. GTPase activating proteins stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity to promote formation of inactive Rho-GDP (4Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Conversely, Rho proteins are activated upon association with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 that promote GDP/GTP exchange. Rho family GEFs (also called Dbl family proteins) contain a Dbl homology (DH) domain, which is responsible for the catalytic activity, in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The function of the PH domains is not entirely clear, but it is thought to target GEFs to the plasma membrane and provide a site for regulation by phospholipids (3Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). When GEFs bind to Rho proteins they catalyze the release of GDP by stabilizing the nucleotide-free or “empty pocket” state. GTP then spontaneously binds and renders these proteins active. In the GTP-bound conformation, Rho proteins interact with and stimulate the activity of numerous downstream effectors. Each Rho family GTPase utilizes distinct, as well as shared, effectors that contribute to their distinct cellular functions. Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA are the most thoroughly understood members of the Rho family. Among the best characterized function of these proteins is their regulation of distinct facets of the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton. Cdc42 and Rac1 stimulate the formation of protrusive structures known as filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively (5Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 6Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar, 7Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). These protrusive structures allow cells to physically extend into new areas, and are accordingly found at the leading edge of migrating cells (1Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). Activated RhoA stimulates the formation of focal adhesions and contractile bundles of actin and myosin, known as stress fibers (8Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). Induction of these structures is mediated by the RhoA effectors mDia and the Rho kinases, ROKα/ROCK2 and ROKβ/ROCK1 (9Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar, 10Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 11Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases are activated by diverse extracellular stimuli that act on a wide spectrum of cell surface receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors, and integrins. In the majority of these situations, Rho GTPase activation is achieved by stimulus-induced activation of a Rho GEF. Whereas some Rho GEFs are highly specific, others are more promiscuous and activate multiple Rho GTPases (3Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Consequently, because each Rho GTPase serves distinct roles in controlling cellular processes, elucidating the precise Rho GTPase specificity of a particular Rho GEF is crucial to understand its function in the regulation of cell behavior. Although RhoA has been the most intensively studied, RhoB and RhoC are highly related proteins that share over 85% amino acid identity with RhoA. Therefore, it is not surprising that these proteins share related functions and regulation. However, there is evidence that they also facilitate distinct cellular functions. For example, RhoB has been shown to exhibit a growth inhibitory function that is not seen with RhoA (12Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RhoC, but not RhoA or RhoB, overexpression has been observed in a variety of human cancers and was shown to enhance tumor cell invasion and metastasis (13Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 14van Golen K.L., Wu, Z.F. Qiao X.T. Bao L.W. Merajver S.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5832-5838PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kleer C.G. van Golen K.L. Zhang Y., Wu, Z.F. Rubin M.A. Merajver S.D. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 579-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). When tested, Rho GEFs that activate RhoA have also activated RhoB and RhoC. Rho GEFs that selectively activate RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC have as yet not been described. While the spectrum and diversity of extracellular signals that cause activation of Rho GTPases continue to grow at a remarkable pace, the identity of the Rho GEFs that link these signals to Rho GTPases is amazingly quite limited. To better understand how Rho GTPase activity is regulated by extracellular signals, we have characterized the product of the ARHGEF3 gene, a Rho family GEF henceforth called XPLN. XPLN is expressed in brain, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, platelets, and macrophages. We demonstrate by several criteria that in vitro and in vivo XPLN stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange on RhoA and RhoB, but not RhoC or other Rho family GTPases. We show that the inability of XPLN to exchange RhoC is mediated by isoleucine 43, a position occupied by valine in RhoA and RhoB. DISCUSSIONUnderstanding the specificity of Rho family GEFs is crucial for appreciating the biological roles of these proteins. In the present study, we have characterized the Dbl family Rho exchange factor XPLN. Our data indicate that XPLN protein expression is limited to the brain, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, platelets, and macrophages. We show that in vitro and in vivo this GEF specifically associates with and activates the RhoA subfamily GTPases RhoA and RhoB, but not RhoC. Importantly, XPLN is the first described Rho regulatory protein that discriminates between members of the RhoA subfamily. In agreement with its regulation of RhoA and RhoB, XPLN stimulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in a Rho kinase-dependent manner. Like other Rho GEFs and activated mutants of Rho proteins (2Pruitt K. Der C.J. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), XPLN expression is sufficient to cause transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.Given that the members of the RhoA subfamily share 85% overall sequence identity, with RhoA and RhoC being 92% identical, a surprising result of this study was that XPLN activates RhoA and RhoB but not RhoC. Based on amino acid sequence alignments, we focused on the amino acid at position 43 in the RhoA subfamily as a possible determinant in the differential activation of RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC. This position is an isoleucine in RhoC, but is occupied by a less bulky valine in RhoA and RhoB. In agreement with this position serving an important function in exchange by XPLN, a I43V mutation in RhoC rendered it a substrate for this GEF. Additionally, a V43I mutation in RhoB significantly and specifically reduced XPLN-stimulated nucleotide exchange. However, the V43I mutation in RhoB and RhoA did not abolish XPLN exchange and the I43V mutation in RhoC did not restore XPLN-induced nucleotide incorporation to the levels observed with wild type RhoA and RhoB, indicating that there are other residues in the Rho proteins and in XPLN that participate in substrate specificity.One candidate residue in XPLN that may confer specificity is aspartic acid 257. The corresponding residues in the GEFs intersectin (leucine 1376), Tiam1 (isoleucine 1187), and Dbs (leucine 766) are thought to play an important role in governing the specificity of exchange (28Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In LARG and VAV2, which possess exchange activity for RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC (this study), the positions analogous to aspartic acid 257 in XPLN are held by uncharged residues (proline 931 in LARG and valine 330 in VAV2). This position is also occupied by uncharged residues (prolines, leucines, isoleucines, or valines) in nearly all GEFs with activity toward RhoA, such as Lbc, Lfc, Lsc, Trio, and Tim (28Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The presence of a charged aspartic acid in this position may be incompatible for XPLN association and exchange on RhoC, but not RhoA or RhoB. Only one other characterized RhoA GEF, NET1, has an aspartic acid at the equivalent position (residue 255, see Fig. 1). In future studies, it will be interesting to determine whether NET1, like XPLN, stimulates GTP incorporation into RhoA and RhoB, but fails to exchange RhoC.The members of the RhoA subfamily all stimulate the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion and are assumed to couple to a similar set of downstream effectors. Of the members of the RhoA subfamily, RhoB appears to be the most divergent with respect to primary structure, subcellular localization, and function (34Prendergast G.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). RhoB predominantly localizes to intracellular membranes, whereas RhoA and RhoC are largely cytoplasmic and plasma membrane-bound (35Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 36Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Although all members of the RhoA subfamily are capable of transforming cells (2Pruitt K. Der C.J. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), RhoB can also inhibit tumor growth in some cases (12Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). With regards to RhoC, recent studies have suggested that it possesses some unique characteristics. Increased RhoC expression has been observed in metastatic melanoma cells and transformed mammary epithelial cells, and overexpression is sufficient for induction of metastasis (13Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 14van Golen K.L., Wu, Z.F. Qiao X.T. Bao L.W. Merajver S.D.

Pathol. 2002; 160: 579-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In agreement with thein vivo data, RhoC overexpression was observed to enhance cell migration and invasion in tissue culture cells (13Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). These findings mark a distinction from RhoA, which antagonizes migration in several cell types (37Allen W.E. Zicha D. Ridley A.J. Jones G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 38Stam J.C. Michiels F. van der Kammen R.A. Moolenaar W.H. Collard J.G.

Sahai and Marshall (42Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) demonstrated that RhoC is also more effective than RhoA at disrupting adherens junctions, a hallmark of epithelial cell transformation, through Rho kinase-mediated contractility.In the light of these described functional differences between the RhoA subfamily members, it is interesting that only a few differences in regulation and downstream signaling have been proposed. The only previously described difference is that RhoC was suggested to bind Rho kinase more efficiently than RhoA (42Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). With most RhoA subfamily regulators and effectors, however, the binding and effects on the three family members have not been studied. Our finding that XPLN activates RhoA and RhoB but not RhoC is interesting given the oncogenic and differential morphogenic properties of RhoC. It is plausible to think that there are cellular events where an activation of RhoA and/or RhoB is required but where the activation of RhoC could be disadvantageous.

In the light of these described functional differences between the RhoA subfamily members, it is interesting that only a few differences in regulation and downstream signaling have been proposed. The only previously described difference is that RhoC was suggested to bind Rho kinase more efficiently than RhoA (42Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). With most RhoA subfamily regulators and effectors, however, the binding and effects on the three family members have not been studied. Our finding that XPLN activates RhoA and RhoB but not RhoC is interesting given the oncogenic and differential morphogenic properties of RhoC. It is plausible to think that there are cellular events where an activation of RhoA and/or RhoB is required but where the activation of RhoC could be disadvantageous. Furthermore, the relatively weak transforming activity of XPLN, compared with several other RhoA subfamily GEFs (17Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), might be because of lack of RhoC activation. Future studies will address this, and determine whether there are other RhoA subfamily GEFs with differential preferences among the three RhoA subfamily members. The catalytic activity of many GEFs is negatively regulated by sequences NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal to the DH domain (3Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Consequently, truncation mutants of GEFs are often constitutively active. However, whereas NH2- and COOH-terminal truncations in XPLN do not have any major effects on its ability to activate RhoA in transiently overexpressed conditions (data not shown), the truncations strongly reduce XPLN transforming activity in stable overexpression conditions. In contrast, truncations of NET1, the closest homolog of XPLN, have enhanced transforming activity (25Chan A.M. Takai S. Yamada K. Miki T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the intrinsic activity of XPLN is not negatively regulated by intramolecular interactions, but instead that XPLN is regulated by expression or by sequestration into specific subcellular compartments. Expression of the related protein NET1 has been found to be regulated at the level of gene transcription (43Shen X., Li, J., Hu, P.P. Waddell D. Zhang J. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15362-15368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Unlike NET1, XPLN/Arhgef3 is not regulated by nuclear-cytosolic shuttling (44Schmidt A. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14581-14588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Clearly, elucidation of the mechanisms of XPLN regulation awaits further characterization. Our observation that XPLN is expressed in only a limited number of tissues and specialized cell types could serve to clarify the signaling pathways and biological functions mediated by this exchange factor. For example, XPLN protein was detected in a macrophage cell line and could possibly participate in RhoA-dependent phagocytosis by these cells (45Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). XPLN is also expressed in platelets. An essential role for RhoA has recently been described in the ability of platelet integrin αIIbβ3 to maintain adhesion under shear stress (46Schoenwaelder S.M. Hughan S.C. Boniface K. Fernando S. Holdsworth M. Thompson P.E. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14738-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We are currently examining the role of XPLN in regulating the integrity of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion in platelets and other cells types, as well as its regulation in vivo.

A survey of 21 representative tissues highlighted a prevalence of V1 mRNA; demonstrated that the relative frequency of expression was V1 > V2 > V3 ≥ V2; and showed that <15% of the tissues transcribed significant levels of all four isoforms. By employing novel and previously described anti-versican antibodies we verified a ubiquitous versican deposition in normal and tumor-associated vascular structures and disclosed differences in the glycanation profiles of versicans produced in different vascular beds. Resting endothelial cells isolated from different tissue sources transcribed several of the versican isoforms but consistently failed to translate these mRNAs into detectable proteoglycans. However, if stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α or vascular endothelial growth factor, they altered their versican expression by de novotranscribing the V3 isoform and by exhibiting a moderate V1/V2 production. Induced versican synthesis and de novo V3 expression was also observed in endothelial cells elicited to migrate in a wound-healing model in vitro and in angiogenic endothelial cells forming tubule-like structures in Matrigel or fibrin clots. The results suggest that, independent of the degree of vascularization, human adult tissues show a limited expression of versican isoforms V0, V2, and V3 and that endothelial cells may contribute to the deposition of versican in vascular structures, but only following proper stimulation.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Google Scholar). Parallel studies in several animal species established that three isoforms, denoted V1, V2, and V3 could be generated by alternative splicing from a larger transcript denoted V0 (21Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Google Scholar, 22Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32992-32998Google Scholar, 23Ito K. Shinomura T. Zako M. Ujita M. Kimata K. J.

Tissue-restricted splice variants were also detected during some phases of embryonic development (25Zako M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9325-9331Google Scholar). The four primary versican isoforms vary in their relative content of the two glycosaminoglycan attachment domains, i.e.glycosaminoglycan-α and glycosaminoglycan-β, which are differentially omitted in the V2 and V1 isoforms and are entirely absent in the V3 one, contributing thereby to a significant side chain polymorphism in different versican variants. In the adult, versican seems to be particularly enriched in vascular structures, where it links to components of the subendothelial basement membrane and to the elastic fibrils (26Aspberg A. Adam S. Kostka G. Timpl R. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20444-20449Google Scholar, 27Wight T.N. Lara S. Riessen R. LeBaron R. Isner I. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 963-973Google Scholar, 28Isogai Z.

Pathol. 1987; 47: 363-376Google Scholar). In these tissue compartments, it is likely to be implicated in both the normal hemostasis of blood vessels as well as to be involved in some of the pathological conditions that may affect these tissue structures. In fact, versican is abundantly produced by vascular smooth muscle cells and its expression is enhanced during atherosclerosis and restenosis causing a higher sequestering of low density lipoprotein in these formations (27Wight T.N.

The PG has also been shown to be produced by one murine-transformed endothelial cell type, although it is presently unclear to what extent it affords a constitutive translational product of normal and diseased human endothelium. Similarly, no information is currently available about how endothelial versican expression may be modulated by factors influencing the activation state/differentiation of the cells, e.g. those operating during processes of inflammation, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Finally, due to the unavailability of immunological reagents that would distinguish the isoforms V0 and V3 from V1 and V2, there is currently scarce information about the relative tissue distribution of the four versican variants. To define the precise transcriptional map of versican isoforms in humans and to address their potential role in the pathophysiology of vascular tissues, we have determined the patterns of expression of these transcripts in the major organs/tissues of the adult and in primary vascular cells under resting and activated conditions. A panel of anti-versican mAbs was produced according to standard procedures by immunizing Balb/c female mice with isolated bovine aorta versicans and screening the hybridomas against the immunogen and related antigens. Specificity of these mAbs has partially been described elsewhere (3Perissinotto D. Iacopetti P. Pettway Z. Gabriele E. Zambon M. Bellina I. Colombatti A. Pettway Z. Bronner-Fraser M. Shinomura T.

Anti-decorin mAb 6B6 was purchased from Seikagaku Corporation and mAb CS56 from Sigma. The anti-human perlecan antibody 7E1 was kindly received from Renato Iozzo (Department of Cell Biology and Pathology, The Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Antiserum As73 against human collagen type VI was produced by immunization of rabbits with tetrameric pepsin-digested placental collagen type VI. The hybridoma clone H/FN-7 producing a mAb against human fibronectin was purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MA). Bovine aorta versicans were isolated as previously described (37Mazzucato M. Cozzi M.R. Pradella P. Perissinotto D. Malmström A. Mörgelin M. Spessotto P. Colombatti A. De Marco L. Perris R.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the various antibodies and enzyme digestions was perfomed as described in previous studies (3Perissinotto D. Iacopetti P. Pettway Z. Gabriele E. Zambon M. Bellina I. Colombatti A. Pettway Z. Bronner-Fraser M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Löfberg J. Mörgelin M. Perris R. Development. 2000; 127: 2823-2842Google Scholar). 3D. Perissinotto, manuscript in preparation. Ultrastructural analyses of antibody bindings to versicans were carried by rotary shadowing and negative stainings performed as previously detailed (11Ericksen G. Carlstedt I. Mörgelin M.

Primary human endothelial cells including HUVEC (umbilical cord), HIAEC (iliac artery), pulmonary artery, coronary artery, adult dermis microvasculature, neonatal dermis microvasculature, adult aorta, and primary human smooth muscle cells, including aorta and uterus were obtained from BioWhittaker Inc. (Walkersville, MD) at the first to third passage. HUVEC were also isolated according to standard procedures from umbilical cords collected in the laboratory. Endothelial cells were maintained in endothelial growth medium (BioWhittaker Inc.) supplemented with l-glutamine (Sigma) and were consistently used prior to the fourth passage. Aorta and uterine smooth muscle cells were grown in smooth muscle growth medium (BioWhittaker Inc.). Hs913T (human fibrosarcoma) and Human intestinal smooth muscle cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10–20% fetal calf serum. For stimulation with cytokines and growth factors, endothelial cells were pre-grown under low-nutrient conditions for 24 h in basal growth medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. The following day, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in serum-containing medium in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml TNF-α (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) or 100 ng/ml VEGF (Chemicon International, Inc.) for 4–48 h. Total RNA was extracted at 4, 8, 16, and 24 h and processed for RT-PCR (see below). Total cellular RNA was isolated from the different cell types using the RNA Fast kit (Molecular Systems, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNAs from the majority of human adult tissues were purchased from Clontech Laboratories. Cartilage RNA was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Di Cesare (The Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York, NY). RNA was also isolated with the above kit from healthy skeletal muscle kindly obtained from Dr. Carlo Minetti (G. Gaslini Pediatric Institute, Genova, Italy) and from mesenteric veins obtained from routine autopsies performed at the National Cancer Institute of Aviano. RT reactions were performed with 1 μg of total RNA using AMV-Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using random hexamer primers. The primers for the PCR amplification of versican isoforms were: PGM-A, 5′-GGCTTTGACCAGTGCGATTAC-3′; PGM-B, 5′-TCAACATCTCATGTTCCTCCC-3′; PGM-C, 5′-TTCTTCACTGTGGGTATAGGTCTA-3′; PGM-D, 5′-CCAGCCATAGTCACATGTCTC-3′. The sizes of the amplifications products were 405 bp for V0 splice form (primers PGM-B + PGM-C), 336 bp for V1 (primers PGM-A + PGM-C), 498 bp for V2 (primers PGM-B + PGM-D) and 429 bp for V3 (primers PGM-A + PGM-D). Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. RT-PCR amplification of a 400-bp fragment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA served as positive internal control. Amplification products were resolved on 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Two sets of probes capable of discriminating between the four versican splice forms (3Perissinotto D. Iacopetti P. Pettway Z. Gabriele E. Zambon M. Bellina I. Colombatti A. Pettway Z. Bronner-Fraser M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Löfberg J. Mörgelin M. Perris R. Development. 2000; 127: 2823-2842Google Scholar) were prepared by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from Hs913T cells using primers PGM-B (sense) + PGM-C (antisense) and PGM-A (sense) + PGM-D (antisense). The probes were cloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). [32P]UTP-labeled antisense riboprobes were synthesized from a SP6 promoter using 25 units of SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega) and were hybridized overnight with 10 μg of total RNA of each human tissue. The degree of intactness and calibration of the amount of input RNA were ascertained by using a human β-actin probe as reference. Post-hybridization procedures were performed using RPA II kit (Ambion) according to the instructions provided by the supplier. The RNase-protected fragments were run on a sequencing gel and autoradiographed, and the specific signals were quantified by computer-aided densitometric scanning. Probe AD allowed the identification of the V3 isoform (429 bp), whereas probe BC hybridized with the V0 (405 bp), V2 (244 bp), and V1 (161 bp) ones. Assessment of the relative levels of expression of the protected transcripts was accomplished by analyzing autoradiograms in the linear exposure range by computer-assisted densitometry using a Philips CCD video camera and the software GelScan. Densities of the autoradiographic bands obtained for each individual isoform were plotted accounting for the specific intensities in 32P activities of the diversely sized fragments. Direct comparison of the relative levels of expression of the individual isoforms in each individual tissue/organ are reported as percent adopting the signal detected for the prevailing isoform of that given tissue/organ as 100%. The nature of the splicing sites of human versican allowed for a direct comparison of the expression levels of the V0–V2 isoforms in the same autoradiograms, whereas the protected signal for the V3 isoform was normalized to that obtained in the same autoradiogram for the cumulative expression of V0–V2 mRNAs. For simulation of angiogenesis, endothelial cells were rinsed in PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in endothelial growth medium at a density of 1–5 × 105cells/ml. Human fibrinogen (kindly received from Luigi De Marco, The National Cancer Institute of Aviano) was diluted at 20 μg/μl in endothelial growth medium. An aliquot of 25 μl of this solution containing the resuspended cells was allowed to solidify by addition of 1 μg of human purified thrombin (kindly provided by Luigi De Marco) in Lab-Tek® plates (Nalge-Nunc International, Naperville, IL). The formed clots were equilibrated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 15 min and covered with 100 μl of medium and supplemented or not with 50 ng/ml TNF-α or 100 ng/ml VEGF. Cultures were maintained for 24–72 h before being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, stained immunocytochemically, and photographed. An alternative assay involved Matrigel; a stock concentration of the specific batch (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford MA; 12.3 mg/ml) which was diluted at 1:1 with ice-cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, gently mixed, and dispensed into 6-well tissue culture plates (1 ml/well) or 48-well plates (0.15 ml/well). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to form a uniform layer and cell suspensions of a similar density as indicated above were then seeded on top of the gels in the appropriate growth medium. Cultures were maintained under standard cell culture conditions for up to 72 h before being fixed and stained as described above. All cultures were routinely monitored by phase contrast microscopy and photographed at different time intervals. Total RNA was extracted from tubule-forming endothelial cells using the RNA Fast Isolation kit and utilized for RT-PCR as described above. For wound-healing simulation assays, HUVECs were seeded at 80% confluence in uncoated 6-well plates and grown to confluence. Confluent monolayers were starved for 4 h in strongly reduced levels of serum (1%), wounded by scraping away a swath of cells with a P1000 pipette tip and further cultured for up to 48 h. After scraping, cells were rinsed twice with PBS to remove wound-derived cell aggregates and debris and either immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or fixed after 4, 8, or 24 h of culture and processed for indirect immunostaining. Alternatively, unfixed cells at the above time intervals were processed for the isolation of total RNA to be used for RT-PCR analyses. Healthy and tumor tissue specimens were obtained from surgical specimens of mammary carcinoma, hepatocarcinoma, colon carcinoma, melanoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrohistocytoma, and liposarcoma performed at the National Cancer Institute of Aviano, or from routine autopsies carried out at the same institute. Tumor tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, embedded in OTC compound (Miles Laboratories) and cryosectioned. Sections were air-dried, incubated with primary antibodies (undiluted supernatant or purified Igs and ascites fluids at 1:100 dilution in PBS with 0.1 mg/ml BSA) at 4 °C overnight, washed and further incubated for 2 h at room temperature with fluorescein- or Texas Red-conjugated polyvalent goat or rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) diluted 1:50–1:100 in PBS/BSA. In some cases, to confirm the identity of the intralesional neoangiogenic vessels, sections from soft tissue sarcoma specimens where double-labeled with anti-versican antibodies and an anti-PECAM (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule) (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) antibody, or anti-versican antibodies and biotinylated Ulex europeaus I lectin (revealed by fluorescently tagged streptavidin; Amersham Bisociences). In a number of other cases, incubation of tissue sections with anti-versican antibodies was preceded by digestions with collagenase or testicular hyaluronidase as previously described (3Perissinotto D.

For immunocytochemical staining, cells grown on plastic Lab-Tek® chamber slides, Matrigel or fibrin clots were washed twice in PBS with BSA 0.1% w/v (Sigma) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 2% v/v normal goat serum (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in PBS/BSA 0.1% w/v followed by incubation with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:100 in PBS/BSA. An alternative staining procedure adopted for immunolabeling with the “fixation-sensitive” mAb 5D5 (3Perissinotto D. Iacopetti P. Pettway Z. Gabriele E. Zambon M. Bellina I. Colombatti A. Pettway Z. Bronner-Fraser M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Löfberg J. Mörgelin M. Perris R.

In both cases, stained cells were finally were mounted with Mowiol 4–88 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) supplemented with 2.5 g/ml DABCO (Sigma) as an anti-fading agent. Bovine aorta versicans and nasal cartilage aggrecan were solubilized in SDS-containing sample buffer in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 3–8% gradient gels. Separated PGs were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were subsequently saturated with α-casein and processed for immunoblotting using the panel of anti-versican antibodies as previously described (3Perissinotto D. Iacopetti P. Pettway Z. Gabriele E. Zambon M. Bellina I. Colombatti A. Pettway Z. Bronner-Fraser M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Löfberg J. Mörgelin M. Perris R. Development. 2000; 127: 2823-2842Google Scholar). For immunochemical detection of versicans produced by activated endothelial cells, cell lysates were prepared from HUVEC grown for 48 h in the presence of 50 ng/ml TNF-α or 100 ng/ml VEGF. Lysis buffer was composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. After lysis, the cell extract was subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 g for 30 min in the cold. Proteins were then fractionated by SDS/PAGE in a 4–20% polyacrylamide gel under reducing and non-reducing conditions and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes overnight. Blots were blocked with dried milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with mAbs 12C5 or 2B1 (at 1:500 dilution in the blocking buffer). The membranes were washed, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (at 1:1000 dilution in TBST) and further processed for chemiluminescent detection (ECL chemiluminescence kit; Amersham Biosciences) as described above. As a first step, to define the expression pattern of versicans in human vascular structures, we determined the overall distribution pattern of the four versican isoforms in a panel human adult tissues by conventional RT-PCR and RNase protection. The first approach asserted a ubiquitous transcription of the versican gene, the resulting transcripts of which were detected in 20 of the 21 tissues examined (Table I). The V1 isoform was found to be the most widespread, expressing in 19 of the 21 tissues, whereas the V2 one was the least frequently transcribed (Table I). More than 50% of the tissues/organs examined expressed detectable levels of all alternatively spliced transcripts, whereas 4 of the tissues/organs examined, namely liver, uterus, spleen, and cartilage expressed solely the V1 isoform (Table I). A more precise quantitative analysis of the expression levels of the different versican isoforms was then performed in the same tissues or organs by RNase protection. The latter assays confirmed the prevalence of the V1 isoform, showing that, on average, it accounted for more than 70% all versican mRNA transcribed by each individual tissue or organ. These experiments also showed that the parental V0 isoform represented the one showing the lowest expression levels (Fig. 1). Furthermore, in several tissues, certain mRNAs that were detected by RT-PCR were found to be actually transcribed at minute levels, when accurately assessed. This finding thereby reduced the number of tissues or organs deemed to express significant quantities of all isoforms from 11 to a mere 3, including mammary gland, heart, and kidney (Fig. 1).Table IVersican isoform transcription in healthy adult human tissue and organs as determined by RT-PCR Open table in a new tab Figure 1Quantitative analysis of versican isoform expression in healthy adult human tissues as determined by RNase protection.

Previously, we have shown SOCS-1 to be a key inhibitor of interferon γ (IFNγ). Recent data suggest that SOCS-1 may regulate other cytokines in vivo, in addition to IFNγ. Uncontrolled responses to interleukin-12 (IL-12), an inflammatory cytokine, could contribute to increased IFNγ production and the development of inflammatory disease in SOCS-1−/− mice. Here, we assess responses of SOCS-1-deficient cells to IL-12. Both IL-12-induced T cell proliferation and NK cytotoxic activity are enhanced in SOCS-1-deficient cells, relative to controls. To examine the contribution of continued IL-12 signaling to the SOCS-1−/− disease, we generated mice lacking both SOCS-1 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4), an essential component of the IL-12 signaling pathway. SOCS-1−/− STAT4−/− mice have improved survival relative to SOCS-1−/− mice, but die between 1 and 2 months of age. We conclude that, in addition to IFNγ, SOCS-1 regulates responses to IL-12.

Cytokines are small, secreted molecules that regulate an array of cellular processes, including hematopoietic differentiation and responses to infection or injury (1Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). As highly potent molecules, both cytokine secretion and responses to cytokines are tightly regulated processes. In the absence of appropriate regulation, autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases may occur. Clearly, maintaining homeostasis of the immune system requires delicate regulation of cytokine production and action.

These findings suggest that SOCS-1 may be an essential physiological regulator of other cytokines in addition to IFNγ and that dysregulated responses to these cytokines may contribute to disease development in SOCS-1−/− mice. In particular, it is unclear why IFNγ levels are elevated in SOCS-1−/−mice, and it is possible this abnormality results from uncontrolled signaling in response to cytokines other than IFNγ. IL-12 is a cytokine that may contribute to SOCS-1−/−disease development based on its ability to induce IFNγ production by activated natural killer (NK) and T cells (16Kobayashi M. Fitz L. Ryan M.

One possibility is that IL-12 signaling may be regulated by inhibitory molecules such as the SOCS proteins. This study examines IL-12-induced responses in SOCS-1-deficient cells and provides evidence that SOCS-1 regulates responses to IL-12 in vivo. All mice were bred and housed in clean but not specific pathogen-free conditions at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.

PCR was performed using 40 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Wild type and knockout STAT4 alleles were amplified to produce 320 and 250 bp PCR products, respectively. Full histological analyses of mice were performed as described previously (15Metcalf D. Mifsud S., Di Rago L. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Unless otherwise stated, for all assays cells were cultured in mouse tonicity RPMI 1640 containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 5 × 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol, at 37 °C in a humidified cell incubator containing 10% (v/v) CO2. Recombinant murine (rm) IL-12 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Single cell suspensions prepared from mesenteric lymph node were depleted of red blood cells and then resuspended in 50 μl of saturating amounts of 2.4G2 anti-Fcγ receptor antibody containing 10% (v/v) normal rat serum, and stained with cocktails of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific for CD4, CD8, or CD44, as described previously (44Alexander W.S. Roberts A.W. Nicola N.A., Li, R. Metcalf D. Blood. 1996; 87: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) with CellQuest Software. Dead cells and erythrocytes were excluded by propidium iodide staining (1 μg/ml) and gating of forward angle and side scatter. Dispersed cell suspensions were prepared from superficial cervical, axillary, brachial, renal, mesenteric, and inguinal lymph nodes from either sick SOCS-1−/− mice (7–15 days old) and their healthy wild type littermates; or SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/−(4–7 weeks old) and age-matched SOCS-1+/+IFNγ−/− mice. Lymph node cells from mice of the same genotype were pooled (4–6 mice/pool) and enriched for T cells using Mouse T Cell Enrichment Columns (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. FACS analysis showed T cell populations were typically greater than 98% pure. T cells were cultured in 96-well U-bottomed plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. Appropriate wells were coated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody (clone KT3-1-1) for at least 1 h at 37 °C, and then antibody was aspirated prior to adding cells. Cultures were stimulated with 0–1000 units/ml rmIL-12 in the presence of 20 μg/ml rat anti-mouse IL-2 antibody (clone JES6–1A12, R&D Systems), and cultured for 1–5 days. [H3]thymidine (1μCi/well; Amersham Biosciences) was added 17 h before harvest of the cultures. Radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter (Packard, Meridin, CT), and the results were expressed as mean cpm ± S.D. of triplicate cultures. Lymph node T cells were purified as described above and then fixed and permeabilized using a Cytoperm/Cytofix kit (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In parallel, T cells were stimulated as described for the proliferation assays, with anti-CD3 antibody and either 0.5 or 50 units/ml rmIL-12. Anti-IL-2 antibody (20 μg/ml) was included in all assays. For the next 4 days, replicate samples of the cells were fixed and permeabilized. Fixed cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml of either polyclonal anti-IL-12R antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or, as a control, polyclonal anti-IL-11R antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Receptor binding was then detected using 1:200-diluted FITC-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by FACS. Spleens were harvested from SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− mice (5–6 weeks old) and age-matched SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− mice (n = 3 mice/genotype), and cell suspensions were red blood cell-depleted. Splenocytes of the same genotype were pooled and cultured overnight at 37 °C in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml, in the presence of 0–1000 units/ml rmIL-12. The following day, splenocytes were washed twice and added to 96-well plates in graded dilutions to obtain the desired Effector:Target (E:T) ratios of 90:1, 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, and 1:1. The NK-susceptible cell line, YAC-1, was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Smyth (Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne). YAC-1 cells were labeled with 100 μCi of 51Cr (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times, and plated at 104 cells/well into plates containing appropriately diluted effector cells. After 4 h at 37 °C, plates were spun, and supernatants were counted in a scintillation counter (Packard). YAC-1 cells were incubated in media alone or in the presence of 10% (v/v) SDS to determine spontaneous and total release, respectively. Specific lysis was calculated by % lysis = (E − S)/(T − S) × 100, where E is the release from experimental samples, S is the spontaneous release, and T is the total release. Microsoft Excel was used for all statistical analyses. Data from in vitro assays were analyzed using a one-tailed Student's t test for independent events with the assumption of equal variance. For the analysis of SOCS-1/STAT4 mice, age-matched mice pairs were compared using a one-tailed Student's paired t test. The deleterious effects of continued IL-12 signaling are evident in inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease (45Parrello T. Monteleone G. Cucchiara S. Monteleone I. Sebkova L. Doldo P. Luzza F. Pallone F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7234-7239Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore uncontrolled responses to IL-12 may contribute to the severe inflammatory disease in SOCS-1−/− mice. To investigate this, in vitro assays were developed to measure IL-12 responses by the two major IL-12-responsive cell types, NK and T cells. Firstly, we assessed IL-12-induced proliferation of SOCS-1−/− T cells. In order to measure proliferation in response to IL-12 alone, a neutralizing antibody to IL-2 was included in all assays. Initially, we assayed purified lymph node T cells from SOCS-1−/− and control mice in the absence of activation with anti-CD3. Under these conditions, T cells are expected to be in a resting state and unresponsive to IL-12. As shown in Fig.1 A, purified T cells did not proliferate in the absence of exogenous cytokine, and IL-12 induced negligible proliferation of T cells from control mice. In contrast, the proliferative response of SOCS-1−/− T cells to IL-12 was significantly greater, suggesting that these cells were activated and expressed functional IL-12R in vivo (Fig.1 A). Due to the poor health and complex phenotype of SOCS-1−/−mice and the activated phenotype of SOCS-1−/− T cells, we decided to use T cells from healthy, adult SOCS-1−/−IFNγ−/− mice to assess IL-12 responses. T cells from age-matched SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− mice were used as a control. T cells from both SOCS-1−/−IFNγ−/− and SOCS-1+/+IFNγ−/− mice responded poorly to IL-12 treatment alone, most likely due to low IL-12R expression by resting T cells (data not shown). Therefore IL-12-induced proliferation was assayed in the presence of a comitogen, anti-CD3, in order to activate T cells and induce IL-12R expression. T cells of both genotypes failed to respond to anti-CD3 alone (Fig. 1 B). The combination of anti-CD3 and IL-12, however, induced a dose-dependent proliferation by both SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− and SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− T cells (Fig.1 B). SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− T cells showed significantly greater proliferation in response to IL-12 than SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− T cells at all IL-12 concentrations tested, and proliferated in response to as little as 0.5 units/ml IL-12 (Fig. 1 B). To determine which cells were expanding in response to IL-12, the T cell composition of the proliferating cells was analyzed by FACS and was expressed as a ratio of CD8/CD4 cells. The CD8/CD4 ratios in initial populations were ∼1:1 for T cells of either genotype (Fig.1 C). These ratios changed slightly after 5 days in culture in the absence of exogenous cytokine (1.3:1 for SOCS-1−/−IFNγ−/−, and 0.5:1 for SOCS-1+/+IFNγ−/− T cells). The T cell composition of SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− samples did not change substantially after culture with IL-12 for 5 days (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, IL-12 induced a dose-dependent increase in the ratio of CD8/CD4 cells (to ∼4.5:1) from SOCS-1−/−IFNγ−/− mice, suggesting that CD8 T cells were more responsive to IL-12 than CD4 T cells (Fig. 1 C). NK and NKT cells were present in negligible numbers in the purified lymph node preparations and did not expand substantially in response to IL-12 (data not shown). Increased IL-12-induced proliferation of SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− lymph node T cells may be due to uncontrolled IL-12 signaling in the absence of SOCS-1 and/or as a result of increased IL-12R expression (46Chang J.T. Shevach E.M. Segal B.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To distinguish these possibilities, IL-12R expression was analyzed by FACS in both freshly isolated lymph node T cells and cells stimulated with IL-12 in combination with anti-CD3 (Fig. 2). IL-12R expression was similar in freshly isolated SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− and SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− lymph node T cells (Fig.2). The combination of IL-12 and anti-CD3 was sufficient to upregulate IL-12R expression on T cells of both genotypes, however, SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− T cells up-regulated IL-12R expression faster (by day 2 of culture) and in response to lower doses of IL-12 (0.5 units/ml) than SOCS-1+/+IFNγ−/− T cells (Fig. 2). Again, this demonstrates that cells from SOCS-1-deficient mice are hypersensitive to IL-12 and suggests that the enhanced IL-12-induced proliferation of SOCS-1-deficient cells may be due both to increased levels of IL-12R expression and to an intrinsic hyper-responsiveness to IL-12. A key function of IL-12 is to induce cytotoxic activity in NK cells (32Robertson M.J. Soiffer R.J. Wolf S.F. Manley T.J. Donahue C. Young D. Herrmann S.H. Ritz J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We analyzed IL-12-induced NK cytotoxic activity in unsorted splenocytes by measuring lysis of the NK susceptible cell line, YAC-1. Previous analyses have shown that the proportion of splenic NK cells is similar in SOCS-1−/−IFNγ−/− and SOCS-1+/+IFNγ−/−mice. 2R. Starr, A. Cornish, W. Alexander, M. Chong, T. Kay, and D. Hilton, manuscript in preparation. Negligible cytotoxicity activity of the splenocytes was observed when cultured in media alone (Fig. 3). IL-12 induced a dose-dependent increase in NK activity in both SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− and SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− splenocytes. SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− splenocytes induced maximal specific lysis of target cells when stimulated with 100 units/ml IL-12. In contrast, SOCS-1+/+IFNγ−/− splenocytes required stimulation with a 10-fold higher dose of IL-12 to achieve this effect. Since IL-12 promotes IFNγ production (16Kobayashi M. Fitz L. Ryan M.

Immunol. 1992; 148: 3433-3440PubMed Google Scholar), an increase in IL-12 production could drive the elevated IFNγ levels seen in SOCS-1−/− mice. We compared the levels of IL-12 in the serum of sick SOCS-1−/− mice and their wild type littermates and in healthy SOCS-1−/−IFNγ−/− and SOCS-1+/+IFNγ−/− mice to determine whether IL-12 levels are elevated in the absence of SOCS-1 and if so, whether it occurs independently of IFNγ. Mouse serum samples were analyzed using an ELISA with a detection sensitivity of ∼12 pg/ml IL-12 (data not shown). Detectable levels of IL-12 were found in the serum of 15% SOCS-1−/− mice (n = 20; data not shown). In contrast, IL-12 was not detected in the serum of SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− mice (n= 10), SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− mice (n = 10), or wild type mice (n = 10; data not shown), suggesting that the elevated IL-12 levels measured in some SOCS-1−/− mice may be secondary to disease development. The in vitro functional assays suggest IL-12 responses are elevated in the absence of SOCS-1. We wished to examinein vivo whether IL-12 contributes to disease in SOCS-1−/− mice. STAT4 is believed to the primary mediator of the biological functions of IL-12 (41Kaplan M.H. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Grusby M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2002006009,"Cytokines are the molecular messengers of the vertebrate immune system, coordinating the local and systemic immune responses to infective organisms. We report here functional and structural data on cytokine-like proteins from a eukaryotic pathogen. Two homologues of the human cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) have been isolated from the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi. Both molecules (Bm-MIF-1 and Bm-MIF-2) show parallel functions to human MIF. They are chemotactic for human monocytes and activate them to produce IL-8, TNF-alpha, and endogenous MIF. The human and nematode MIF homologues share a tautomerase enzyme activity, which is in each case abolished by the mutation of the N-terminal proline residue. The crystal structure of Bm-MIF-2 at 1.8-A resolution has been determined, revealing a trimeric assembly with an inner pore created by beta-stranded sheets from each subunit. Both biological activity and crystal structure reveal remarkable conservation between a human cytokine and its parasite counterpart despite the considerable phylogenetic divide among these organisms. The strength of the similarity implies that MIF-mediated pathways play an important role in nematode immune evasion strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2036411010,"Bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is a serious problem limiting current clinical therapy. The most common form of resistance is the production of β-lactamases that inactivate β-lactam antibiotics. Toho-1 is an extended-spectrum β-lactamase that has acquired efficient activity not only to penicillins but also to cephalosporins including the expanded-spectrum cephalosporins that were developed to be stable in former β-lactamases. We present the acyl-intermediate structures of Toho-1 in complex with cefotaxime (expanded-spectrum cephalosporin), cephalothin (non-expanded-spectrum cephalosporin), and benzylpenicillin at 1.8-, 2.0-, and 2.1-Å resolutions, respectively. These structures reveal distinct features that can explain the ability of Toho-1 to hydrolyze expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. First, the Ω-loop of Toho-1 is displaced to avoid the steric contacts with the bulky side chain of cefotaxime. Second, the conserved residues Asn104 and Asp240 form unique interactions with the bulky side chain of cefotaxime to fix it tightly. Finally, the unique interaction between the conserved Ser237 and cephalosporins probably helps to bring the β-lactam carbonyl group to the suitable position in the oxyanion hole, thus increasing the cephalosporinase activity.

Lamotte-Brasseur J. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 581-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The antibiotics form stable acyl-enzymes with penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 1The abbreviations used for: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; ESBL, extended spectrum β-lactamase. in the membrane of the bacterial cell. PBPs function in the biosynthesis and repair of the peptidoglycan of the cell wall; thus, the inhibition of these enzymes induces cell death. However, resistant bacteria escape from the lethal action of β-lactam antibiotics mainly by producing β-lactamases that hydrolyze the antibiotics. β-Lactamases are acylated by β-lactam antibiotics in a similar manner as PBPs; however, they are rapidly deacylated. β-Lactamases are classified into four groups (classes A, B, C, and D) according to their amino acid sequences and substrate profiles (1Matagne A. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 581-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Classes A, C, and D β-lactamases are serine β-lactamases, whereas class B β-lactamases are zinc-containing β-lactamases. Among these four classes of β-lactamases, class A β-lactamases are especially important, because they exhibit highly variable substrate profiles and in general are encoded by plasmids and are easily transferable between cells, thereby threatening clinical antibiotic therapy. The expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (oxyimino-cephalosporins) including cefotaxime were developed to be stable in the former class A β-lactamases such as TEM-1 and SHV-1 (1Matagne A. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 581-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These compounds are characterized by a bulky acylamide side chain containing an oxyimino group. Many of these compounds also contain an aminothiazole ring. However, after extensive and sometimes abusive clinical use of these antibiotics, resistant bacteria began to produce new class A β-lactamases capable of hydrolyzing oxyimino-cephalosporins called extended- spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) (1Matagne A. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 581-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). ESBLs are classified into two groups. The first of these groups (type I) consists of variants of TEM-1 or SHV-1 that differ by a few amino acid substitutions. The second group (type II) includes enzymes that are not related to TEM-1 or SHV-1 (2Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoded CTX-M-type ESBLs are the most widespread family of type II ESBLs and are increasingly on the rise. Contrary to what was originally thought of class A β-lactamases, CTX-M-type ESBLs have an efficient hydrolytic activity toward oxyimino-cephalosporins but exhibit lower activity toward penicillins than non-ESBLs (3Tzouvelekis L.S. Tzelepi E. Tassios P.T. Legakis N.J. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2000; 14: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Toho-1 belongs to the CTX-M-type ESBLs (4Ishii Y. Ohno A. Taguchi H. Imajo S. Ishiguro M. Matsuzawa H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the structure of the Toho-1 mutant E166A whose overall fold was shown to be similar to non-ESBLs (5Ibuka A. Taguchi A. Ishiguro M. Fushinobu S. Ishii Y. Kamitori S.

Toho-1 has some variations in hydrogen-bonding patterns and an increase in flexibility of the β-strand B3 as well as the Ω-loop. Yet, it was still unclear how these differences increase oxyimino-cephalosporinase activity of Toho-1, because a complex structure with an oxyimino-cephalosporin was not determined. In addition to Toho-1, there have been seven other x-ray structures of oxyimino-cephalosporin-hydrolyzing β-lactamases solved (TEM-52 (6Orencia M.C. Yoon J.S. Ness J.E. Stemmer W.P.C. Stevens R.C.

Therefore, we used a Glu166mutant of Toho-1 to trap the acyl-intermediate in a similar manner as was done for the acyl-intermediate structures of non-ESBLs (16Chen C.C.H. Herzberg O.

In a class A β-lactamase from Bacillus licheniformis, the structure of E166A is known to display few differences with the wild type enzyme (19Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Escobar W.A. Fink A.L. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The acyl-intermediate structures of the mutant E166A with cefotaxime, cephalothin, and benzylpenicillin were determined at 1.8-, 2.0-, and 2.1-Å resolutions, respectively (TableI). The overall fold of these acyl-intermediate structures is the same as the previously reported unbound Toho-1 E166A (5Ibuka A. Taguchi A. Ishiguro M. Fushinobu S. Ishii Y. Kamitori S. Okuyama K. Yamaguchi K. Konno M. Matsuzawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with root mean square deviations among the Cα positions of 0.25, 0.21, and 0.25 Å for the cefotaxime-, cephalothin- and benzylpenicillin-intermediate structures, respectively. The active sites of these acyl-intermediate structures are shown in Fig. 1, A–C, with 2F o − F c electron density maps around the bound substrates. In the cephalosporin-intermediate structures (Fig. 1, A andB), the C3′-leaving group has been removed as observed in other acyl-enzyme structures in complex with cephalosporins (15Kuzin A.P. Liu H.

In the cefotaxime-intermediate structure, residues Pro167, Asn170, Ser237, Asp240, and Arg274 surround the bulky side chain of cefotaxime. In addition, both side chain oxygens of Asp240 interact with the amino group in the aminothiazole ring, which may be involved in the binding of cefotaxime (Fig.1 A). The thiophene substituent of cephalothin in the cephalothin-intermediate and the benzyl group of benzylpenicillin in the benzylpenicillin-intermediate are seen in a nearly identical position with the aminothiazole ring and the methoxyimino group of cefotaxime, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). Substrate binding does not induce conformational changes in the Ω-loop and the β-strand B3 but rather causes a structural rearrangement of residues Arg274, Ser237, and Asn104 (Fig.2, A and B). Arg274 is a unique residue in Toho-1 not found in any other CTX-M-type ESBLs (Fig. 3). In the unbound Toho-1 structure, Arg274 is obstructing the substrate binding pocket, but upon substrate binding, Arg274 is forced out of the active site by the side chain of the substrate (Fig.2 A).Figure 3Sequence alignments of class A β-lactamases.

In the cephalothin-intermediate structure, Ser237 has rotated ∼30°, whereas in the cefotaxime-intermediate and benzylpenicillin-intermediate, there is an ∼150° rotation of the side chain. This rotation prevents steric clashes with the methoxyimino (cefotaxime) and the methyl group (benzylpenicillin) of the substrate. Asn104 is positioned at a bend in the binding site formed by Val103-Asn104-Tyr105-Asn106(Fig. 2 B). This VNYN sequence is conserved in the CTX-M-type ESBLs, whereas a VXYS sequence is most common in the non-ESBLs in this region (Fig. 3). In the unbound structure, the side chain of Asn106 makes hydrogen bonds with the backbone groups of Val103 to maintain this bent conformation. However, in the acyl-intermediate structures, the Nδ of Asn106 changes its hydrogen bond acceptor from backbone oxygen of Val103 to that of Asn106 by causing a slight rotation of the peptide bond between Asn104 and Tyr105, which forces Val103 and Asn106 to be held in unfavorable conformations. This exchange is induced by the side chain movement of Asn104 to interact with the substrate. The movement of Asn104 also induces the movement of Asn132 whose side chain interacts with Asn104 and the substrate (Fig. 2 B). The main differences between the benzylpenicillin-intermediate and the cephalosporin-intermediates are observed around Ser70 and the oxyanion hole. In the benzylpenicillin-intermediate, the carbonyl group of the β-lactam ring does not position suitably for the hydrolysis in the oxyanion hole (Fig. 2 C). This is caused by van der Waals contact between the methyl group of the thiazolidine ring, and the Cβ and the Oγ of Ser237. An oxyanion hole formed by the backbone amides of Ser70 and residue 237 interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of the β-lactam ring in the substrate (1Matagne A. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 581-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These interactions play essential roles for the hydrolysis by stabilizing the negative charge appeared on the β-lactam carbonyl oxygen when the tetrahedral intermediates are formed during both acylation and deacylation. These interactions also help to polarize the carbonyl group of the β-lactam ring, thus favoring the nucleophilic attack to the carbonyl carbon by Ser70 in acylation and by the hydrolytic water in deacylation. In the cephalosporin-intermediate structures of Toho-1, the carbonyl oxygens of the β-lactam ring are located at similar distances from both backbone nitrogens (2.6–2.9 Å) to those in other class A β-lactamase acyl-intermediate structures with substrate (2.7–3.0 Å) (16Chen C.C.H. Herzberg O. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 20Fonze E. Vanhove M. Dive G. Sauvage E. Frère J.M. Charlier P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1877-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the benzylpenicillin-intermediate structure, however, the carbonyl oxygen exists at a distance of 2.6 Å from the backbone nitrogen of Ser70, but 3.2 Å from the backbone nitrogen of Ser237, meaning that the polarization of the carbonyl group of benzylpenicillin is less efficient for deacylation than that of cephalosporins. This finding indicates that the lower penicillinase activity of CTX-M-type ESBLs compared with non-ESBLs is due to the conserved residue Ser237 (Fig. 3). Actually, in CTX-M-4 and a chromosomal β-lactamase from P. vulgaris K1 sharing high sequence homologies with CTX-M-type ESBLs, the S237A mutants exhibited increasedk cat/K m− value toward benzylpenicillin (23Gazouli M. Tzelepi E. Sidorenko S.V. Tzouvelekis L.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tamaki M. Nukaga M. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10200-10206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This information may be useful for the development of new type inhibitors against CTX-M-type ESBLs. The acyl-intermediate structures of Toho-1 and non-ESBLs show similar interactions with the substrates (16Chen C.C.H. Herzberg O. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) (Figs.1, A–C, and 4, black dotted lines), but there are some key differences that can explain their specificities. First, Toho-1 lacks two hydrogen bonds formed by Arg244 in non-ESBLs, because CTX-M-type ESBLs do not contain Arg244present in most non-ESBLs (Fig. 3). In the acyl-intermediate structures of non-ESBLs, Arg244 interacts with the carboxylate oxygen of the substrate and the backbone oxygen of Gly236 (Fig.4). Site-directed mutagenesis analyses indicate that Arg244 is critical for the catalysis of TEM-1 (25Delaire M. Labia R. Samama J.P. Masson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20600-20606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zafaralla G. Manvathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3847-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In Toho-1, Arg276 was predicted to be a substitute for Arg244 (4Ishii Y. Ohno A. Taguchi H. Imajo S. Ishiguro M. Matsuzawa H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar); however, this residue has no interactions with the substrates (Figs. 1, A–C, and2 A). Instead, in Toho-1, Ser237 forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate oxygen of the substrate (Fig. 4). This unique interaction induces the rotation of the carboxylate group in the acyl- intermediate structures of Toho-1 compared with those of non-ESBLs. The residue Ser237 is conserved in all CTX-M-type ESBLs (Fig.3), suggesting that this interaction plays a key role in the hydrolysis of oxyimino-cephalosporins. Interestingly, in the cefotaxime-intermediate structure of a PBP from Streptomycessp. R61, Thr301, the corresponding residue to Ser237 of Toho-1, interacts with the amide group of acylamide side chain in cefotaxime to stabilize substrate binding, whereas in the cephalothin-intermediate structure (15Kuzin A.P. Liu H. Kelly J.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9532-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), Thr301 interacts with the carboxylate oxygen as is seen in Toho-1 acyl-intermediate structures. This difference is brought about by steric hindrance between the bulky side chain of the substrates and the active site residues causing a tilt in cefotaxime binding compared with that of cephalothin. Other differences are observed on the interactions with the acylamide side chain of the substrate in Toho-1. In the acyl- intermediate structures of class A β-lactamases, the acylamide side chain of the substrate interacts with the Nδ of Asn132 and the backbone oxygen of residue 237 (Fig. 4). The residue Asn132 is the third residue of the conserved Ser130-Asp131-Asn132 motif in class A β-lactamases, and the hydrogen bond between the Nδ of Asn132 and the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate is proposed to be important for the recognition of cephalosporins (27Jacob F. Joris B. Dideberg O. Dusart J. Ghuysen J.M. Frère J.M. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The residue 237 exists just after the conserved Lys234-Thr235-Gly236 motif on the β-strand B3 in class A β-lactamases. These residues are found at slightly different positions among these three acyl-intermediate structures in Fig. 4. The differences between two non-ESBLs caused by the narrower binding cavity of TEM-1 are thought to produce the divergence of substrate specificities between these non-ESBLs (28Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.M. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Considering that the oxyimino group and the aminothiazole ring are introduced in the acylamide side chain of oxyimino-cephalosporins, the different positions of Asn132 and Ser237 would contribute to the oxyimino-cephalosporinase activity of Toho-1. In non-ESBLs, the position of Asn132 is fixed by the interactions between Asp131 and Thr/Ser109 as well as the interaction between the Nδ of Asn132 and the backbone oxygen of residue 104 (Fig. 4) (28Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.M. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar,29Petit A. Maveyraud L. Lenfant F. Samama J.P. Labia R. Masson J.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, CTX-M-type ESBLs lacks these interactions because these enzymes have an alanine at position 109 (Fig. 3), and the peptide bond between residues 104 and 105 is flipped compared with non-ESBLs (Fig.4). Instead, the Oδ of Asn104 interacts with the Nδ of Asn132 in Toho-1. This unique peptide bond conformation in the vicinity of Asn104 is attained by the conserved VNYN sequence in Toho-1 as mentioned above. As for residue 237, the position of this residue is affected by van der Waals contact between the β-strand B3 and the side chain of residue 69 in class A β-lactamases (28Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.M. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 30Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Frère J.M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although residue 69 is variable in class A β-lactamases, a cysteine is conserved at this position in CTX-M-type ESBLs (Fig. 3), which may place Ser237 at a unique position. The lack of an interaction between Gly236and Arg244 present in non-ESBLs and the flexibility of the β-strand B3 as mentioned previously (5Ibuka A. Taguchi A. Ishiguro M. Fushinobu S. Ishii Y. Kamitori S. Okuyama K. Yamaguchi K. Konno M. Matsuzawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) also affect the position of Ser237 in Toho-1. In fact, in Toho-1, the distance between the backbone amide groups of Ser70 and Ser237constructing an oxyanion hole (4.3 Å) is shorter than that in TEM-1 (4.9 Å) (28Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.M. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and the average in class A β-lactamases (4.7 Å) (30Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Frère J.M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, in Toho-1, a unique hydrogen bond is formed between the Nδ of Asn104 and the carbonyl oxygen of the acylamide side chain of the substrate in addition to the hydrogen bonds seen in non-ESBLs (Fig. 4). Furthermore, in the cefotaxime-intermediate structure, Asp240 interacts with the amino group in the aminothiazole ring of the acylamide side chain (Fig. 4). Thus, Toho-1 can fix the bulky side chain of cefotaxime more tightly in the binding site. Asn104 and Asp240 are conserved in CTX-M-type ESBLs (Fig. 3), indicating that these interactions promote oxyimino-cephalosporinase activity. Non-ESBLs have a low oxyimino-cephalosporinase activity (1Matagne A. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 581-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). It is thought that steric hindrance between the bulky side chains of oxyimino-cephalosporins and the Ω-loop of non-ESBLs reduces"
https://openalex.org/W2018398859,"We have previously reported that syntaxin 1A, a component of the presynaptic SNARE complex, directly modulates N-type calcium channel gating in addition to promoting tonic G-protein inhibition of the channels, whereas syntaxin 1B affects channel gating but does not support G-protein modulation (Jarvis, S. E., and Zamponi, G. W. (2001) J. Neurosci. 21, 2939–2948). Here, we have investigated the molecular determinants that govern the action of syntaxin 1 isoforms on N-type calcium channel function. In vitro evidence shows that both syntaxin 1 isoforms physically interact with the G-protein β subunit and the synaptic protein interaction (synprint) site contained within the N-type calcium channel domain II–III linker region. Moreover, in vitro evidence suggests that distinct domains of syntaxin participate in each interaction, with the COOH-terminal SNARE domain (residues 183–230) binding to Gβ and the N-terminal (residues 1–69) binding to the synprint motif of the channel. Electrophysiological analysis of chimeric syntaxin 1A/1B constructs reveals that the variable NH2-terminal domains of syntaxin 1 are responsible for the differential effects of syntaxin 1A and 1B on N-type calcium channel function. Because syntaxin 1 exists in both “open” and “closed” conformations during exocytosis, we produced a constitutively open form of syntaxin 1A and found that it still promoted G-protein inhibition of the channels, but it did not affect N-type channel availability. This state dependence of the ability of syntaxin 1 to mediate N-type calcium channel availability suggests that syntaxin 1 dynamically regulates N-type channel function during various steps of exocytosis. Finally, syntaxin 1A appeared to compete with Gγ for the Gβ subunit both in vitro and under physiological conditions, suggesting that syntaxin 1A may contain a G-protein γ subunit-like domain.

The interaction of SNAP25 and syntaxin 1A or 1B with the N-type calcium channel acts as a negative feedback mechanism, such that N-type calcium channel availability is reduced in the presence of these proteins, which is reflected as a negative shift in the half-inactivation potential of the channels (13Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 363-366Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 14Bezprozvanny I. Zhong P. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that this effect is abolished when both syntaxin 1 and SNAP25 are present concomitantly, or following coexpression of nSec-1 (also called Munc-18, unc-18), and that protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of the channel abolishes the shift in steady state inactivation (16Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings indicate that the effects of syntaxin 1 on channel availability are labile and may occur only transiently, thus allowing for dynamic regulation of channel availability during the process of vesicle release (17Stanley E.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1007-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The effect of nSec-1 is particularly intriguing, because nSec-1 has been shown to associate with the “closed” conformation of syntaxin 1A (18Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting A.E.

This raises the possibility that the conformational state of syntaxin 1 may regulate its ability to affect N-type calcium channel availability, a curious regulatory phenomenon that has not been previously examined. In addition to directly reducing channel activity, syntaxin 1A also inhibits N-type calcium channels indirectly via G-protein βγ subunits (16Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jarvis S.E. Magga J. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E.A. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2949-2957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An interaction between G-protein pathways and syntaxin 1 was first reported by Stanley and Mirotznik (28Stanley E.F. Mirotznik R.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), who showed that G-protein inhibition of N-type calcium channels in chick calyces was abolished following cleavage of syntaxin 1 with botulinum toxin C. In transient expression systems, coexpression of syntaxin 1A results in a tonic inhibition of N-type calcium channels that can be reversed following application of strong depolarizing prepulses, and in combination with biochemical evidence, we suggested that syntaxin 1A may act as a chaperone to co-localize Gβγ and the N-type calcium channel α1 subunit (26Jarvis S.E. Magga J. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E.A. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this effect is not observed following coexpression of syntaxin 1B, and neurons that only express the syntaxin 1B isoform do not undergo tonic G-protein inhibition unless syntaxin 1A is exogenously expressed (27Lü Q. AtKisson M.S. Jarvis S.E. Feng Z.P. Zamponi G.W. Dunlap K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2949-2957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have examined the molecular basis of the differential effects of syntaxin 1A and 1B on N-type calcium channel function. In vitro data show that both syntaxins interact with the N-type calcium channel synprint motif and with G-proteins, whereas chimerical constructs reveal that differential effects of the two isoforms on G-protein inhibition of the channel are in fact mediated by structural differences in the N-terminal domains of the syntaxins. Using a series of syntaxin 1A truncation mutants, we have identified the structural domains that are involved in interacting with Gβ and the N-type calcium channel. Interestingly, we discovered that the syntaxin 1-G-protein complex does not appear to include the Gγ subunit, indicating that syntaxin may serve as a G-protein γ-like protein. Coexpression of a mutant version of syntaxin 1A that is permanently locked in the open conformation, a state associated with inclusion into the SNARE core complex (19Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), resulted in robust tonic G-protein inhibition, but did not affect the position of the steady state inactivation curve of the channel. The finding that the conformation of syntaxin 1A can differentially regulate channel availability may implicate a number of syntaxin 1A-binding proteins in channel N-type channel regulation. All PCR reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD) unless otherwise stated. T4 DNA ligase and all restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs unless otherwise stated. All PCRs and mutageneses were carried out using a PTC-100HB thermal cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA) and sequenced to ensure accuracy of the replication. Unless otherwise stated, all constructs used in this study were derived from Rattus norvegicus brain tissue, kindly provided by Bob Winkfein. The creation of Gγ2 in pMT2 for expression in tsA-201 cells was previously described in Jarvis et al. (26Jarvis S.E. Magga J. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E.A. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). At all steps, proteins were kept at 4 °C, unless otherwise stated. The cloning of syntaxins 1A and 1B and their insertion into the mammalian expression vector pMT2 has been previously described (16Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,27Lü Q. AtKisson M.S. Jarvis S.E. Feng Z.P. Zamponi G.W. Dunlap K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2949-2957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syntaxin 1A open, as per Dulobova et al. (19Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) was prepared by mutating Leu165 and Glu166of syntaxin 1A to alanines, using standard mutagenesis conditions, such as previously described (16Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used were: forward, 5′-CCACGACCAGTGAGGAGGCCGCCGACATGCTGGAGAGTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCACTCTCCAGCATGTCGGCGGCCTCCTCACTGGTCGTGG-3′. Constructs consisting of residues 1–267 of syntaxin 1A and 1–266 of syntaxin 1B (the cytoplasmic domains with a small segment of the transmembrane domain) were designed for insertion into pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) and expression as readily soluble GST fusion constructs. Standard PCR reaction conditions, previously described (16Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used, along with 2 mmMgCl2. The primers (operon) were designed to introduce a 5′EcoRI and 3′ XhoI site. The primers used for syntaxin 1A were: forward, 5′-CGGAATTCCATGAAGGACCGAACCCAGGAGCTCCGC-3′; reverse, 5′-CACTCGAGCTAGATCATGATCTTCTTCCTGCGTGCCTTGC-3′. The primers used for syntaxin 1B were: forward, 5′-GCGAATTCCATGAAGGATCGGACTCAGGAGCTGCGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CACTCGAGCTAGATCATAATTTTCTTCCTCCTGGCCTTCG-5′. Following the PCR, the products were gel purified and ligated into a T-Easy vector (Promega). Next, the constructs were digested withEcoRI and XhoI and inserted in-frame into like-digested pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The syntaxin 1A-pGEX-4T-3 construct was then subjected to a round of mutagenesis to create syntaxin 1A open-pGEX-4T-3. The mutagenesis conditions were identical to those described above, with the exception that 12 ng of syntaxin 1A-pGEX-4T-3 cDNA was used as the template. Residues 183–230 of syntaxin 1A were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pTrcHis vector. These chimeras were created in a three-step process: 1) mutagenesis to disrupt the downstream EcoRI site of the pMT2 polylinker, producing a syntaxin 1(A/B)-pMT2ΔE construct with only a single EcoRI site in the 5′ polylinker; 2) mutagenesis to introduce a silent AgeI site at Arg108 in syntaxin 1A and Arg107 in syntaxin 1B, producing a syntaxin 1(A/B)-pMT2ΔE+A clone; 3) both syntaxin constructs were digested withAgeI and EcoRI and religated with the equivalent segment of the different isoform. Primers used in these procedures were from Invitrogen. Standard mutagenesis conditions were used, with 25 ng of template. The primers used were: forward, 5′-GAAAGGTACCCTCGAGCAATTCCGGGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCCCGGAATTGCTCGAGGGTACCTTTC-3′. Standard mutagenesis conditions were used, with 100 ng of template. The primers used were: forward, 5′-CCCTACCCTTCTCGAGCAATTCCGGGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCCCGGAATTGGAGCTCTTCCCATCCC-3′. Standard mutagenesis conditions were used, with 25 ng of cDNA. The primers used for syntaxin 1A-pMT2ΔE were: forward, 5′-GGAGGAAGGTCTGAACCGGTCGTCGGCGGACCTGAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTCAGGTCCGCCGACGACCGGTTCAGACCTTCCTCC-3′. The primers used for syntaxin 1B-pMT2ΔE were: forward, 5′-GCAGGAAGAGGGGTTGAACCGGTCTTCTGCAGACCTGCG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGCAGGTCTGCAGAAGACCGGTTCAACCCCTCTCCCTGC-3′. The constructs that were successfully doubly mutated were digested withEcoRI and AgeI and the products were gel purified. Equivalent segments were swapped to create the chimeras. These chimeras were constructed in a two-step process: 1) introduction of silent MluI sites in each isoform to create syntaxin 1(A/B)-pMT2+Mlu, and 2) swapping the fragments. Standard mutagenesis conditions were used, using 10 ng of cDNA. The primers used for syntaxin 1A were: forward, 5′-CCCTCAGTGAGATCGAGACGCGTCACAGTGAGATCATCAAGTTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCAACTTGATGATCTCACTGTGACGCGTCTCGATCTCACTGAGGG-3′. The primers for syntaxin 1B were: forward, 5′-CCCTGAATGAGATAGAGACGCGTCACAATGAGATCATCAAACTGGAAACC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTTTCCAGTTTGATGATCTCATTGTGACGCGTCTCTATCTCATTCAGGG-3′. Positive constructs from step 1 (syntaxin 1(A/B)-pMT2+Mlu) were digested with MluI andXhoI. Equivalent segments were swapped to create the chimeras. Premature stop codons were introduced into syntaxin 1A in pGEX-4T-3 to produce GST-tagged coding sequences corresponding to amino acids 1–228, 1–183, 1–158, 1–109, and 1–69. Standard mutagenesis conditions were used, with 12 ng of syntaxin 1A-GST template cDNA. The primers (operon) were: 228 forward, 5′-GGTGGAGAGCCAGGGGTAGATGATTGACAGGATCG-3′, 228 reverse, 5′-CGATCCTGTCAATCATCTACCCCTGGCTCTCCACC-3′; 183 forward, 5′-GCCTCTGGGATCATCTAGGACTCCAGCATCTCGAAGC 3′, 183 reverse, 5′-GCTTCGAGATGCTGGAGTCCTAGATGATCCCAGAGGC-3′; 158 forward, 5′-GCTGGAGATCACTGGCTAGACCACGACCAGTGAGG-3′, 158 reverse, 5′-CCTCACTGGTCGTGGTCTAGCCAGTGATCTCCAGC-3′; 109 forward, 5′-GGAAGGTCTGAACCGCTAGTCGGCGGACCTGAGG-3′, 109 reverse, 5′-CCTCAGGTCCGCCGACTAGCGGTTCAGACCTTCC-3′; 69 forward, 5′-CCTCCCCGAACCCCGATTAGAAGACCAAGGAGGCC-3′, 69 reverse, 5′-GGCCTCCTTGGTCTTCTAATCGGGGTTCGGGGAGG-3′. Standard PCR conditions with the addition of 1.5 mmMgCl2 were used as previously described in Jarvis et al. (26Jarvis S.E. Magga J. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E.A. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The primers (operon) were designed to introduce a 5′XhoI and 3′ KpnI site. The primers used were: forward, 5′-GCACTAAGATCTCGAGATGAGTGAACTTGACCAGTTACGGCAGG-3′, reverse, 5′-CCTGCGGTACCGGTTAGTTCCAGATTTTGAGGAAGCTGTCCC-3′. The product cDNA was gel purified and inserted into pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega). Next, the construct was digested with XhoI andKpnI and inserted in-frame into like-digested pTrcHisA (Invitrogen). We have previously described the cloning of Gβ5from rat brain via reverse transcriptase-PCR (29Arnot M.I. Stotz S.C. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). UsingXhoI and KpnI sites, the Gβ5 insert was excised from pGEM T-Easy and subcloned in-frame into pTrcHisA. This procedure was used for all His6 constructs in pTrcHis vectors transformed in Escherichia coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). The conditions used were adapted from the recommended conditions by the manufacturer. Briefly, the constructs were grown in a 200-ml culture of SOB broth to A 600 = 0.6, at which point protein expression was induced with 100 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and the cultures were grown for 3.5 to 4 h. Cells were harvested, lysed by 3 cycles of sonication/freeze-thaw in the presence of 100 μl of egg white lysozyme (Sigma), and 20 μl of protease inhibitor mixture containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, bestatin, pepstatin, E-64, phosphoramidon (Sigma, P-8849). The lysates were treated with RNase A (5 μg/ml), centrifuged to remove insoluble debris, filtered, and used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Batch purifications (with settling and aspiration between steps) proceeded as follows: Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen) were buffer equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (20 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl) and made up to 50%. All incubations/washes were conducted at 4 °C to minimize protein unfolding and proteolysis. Beads were incubated with 3 volumes of lysate in the presence of 12 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by a 10-min washing. The wash buffer consisted of 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.0, 500 mm NaCl, 21 mm imidazole, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100. The beads were then incubated a second time with conditions identical to the first incubation. The beads were then washed (as a minimum) with 2 × 30 bed volumes of wash buffer for 15 min each. Beads were settled, and all supernatant was removed prior to the elution step. For elution, proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in 20 mmNa2HPO4, pH 6.0, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole. Eluted proteins were dialyzed overnight in Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Pierce) at 4 °C against 4 liters of PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mmKH2PO4). His6 proteins were use immediately or stored at −80 °C. The Western blots presented in this report show two bands for the His6-tagged synprint motif, a full-length band at 30 kDa and a truncated band at 25 kDa. The truncated band most likely arises from protease degradation in the absence of sufficient or specific protease inhibitors, although it nonetheless behaves the same in vitro as the full-length peptide. This procedure was used for the preparation of all constructs in pGEX-4T-3 vectors transformed in BL21 cells. All steps, except growth, were carried out at 4 °C. A 1-liter culture at 37 °C was grown from a single colony to A 600 = 0.5, at which point protein expression was induced by 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were grown for 4 h and harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 35 ml of resuspension buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm EDTA, 350 mm NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μl of protease inhibitor mixture P8849 (Sigma)), and passed twice through a French press. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and the lysate was either used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were equilibrated with PBST and made to a 50% slurry for use in batch purification. 50% beads were incubated 1:3 with the lysate for 1 h followed by a 20-bed volume wash with PBST and a second incubation with lysate. The final washes consisted of 20 bed volumes of PBST for 10 min, 20 bed volumes of MKM buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 4.5 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 0.2% Triton X-100) for 10 min, 20 bed volumes of PBST supplemented with 350 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min, and finally 20 bed volumes of PBST for 10 min. After the final wash, the beads were allowed to completely settle by gravity, aspirated, and resuspended to a 50% slurry in PBST, which was subsequently used for binding assays. Whole rat brains were prepared as previously described (10Magga J. Jarvis S.E. Arnot M.I. Zamponi G.W. Braun J.E.A. Neuron. 2000; 28: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), although here, whole brains, and the protease inhibitor mixture P-8849 (Sigma) were used. Binding reactions were prepared in a total volume of 600 μl consisting of purified proteins, bead-bound proteins, PBS, and 0.1% Tween 20 in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Incubation conditions proceeded at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation for 2 to 3 h. Each reaction consisted of between 20 and 80 μl (indicated in figures) of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose with a bound purified GST fusion protein. To this was added one of (a) between 80 and 100 μl of purified His6 fusion protein that had been dialyzed against PBS; (b) 50–100 ng of purified Gβγ subunits (Calbiochem); or (c) 150 μl of rat brain homogenate, unless otherwise stated. Washing consisted of two 20-min incubations with 1 ml of PBST. Postwashing, the wash buffer was completely aspirated and 42 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added directly to the beads, which were then incubated with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation at 95 °C for 1 min. The tubes were then spun in a microcentrifuge (13,000 × gfor 1 min) and the samples were frozen at −20 °C until loading for SDS-PAGE. 20 μl of proteins in 2× Laemmli sample buffer were loaded per lane and run on 4.8% stacking and 12% separating gels. Proteins were transferred from SDS-PAGE gels to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) either at 30 V overnight or 100 V for 1 h. The membrane was blocked in 5% skim milk powder in PBST for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated with the primary antibody (see below) in 5% skim milk powder in PBST for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with 2× PBST and 2× PBS for 10 min, then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (see below) in 2% skim milk powder in PBST at the indicated concentrations for 1 to 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was again washed, as above, and subjected to chemiluminescence analysis using ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences) and detected on Kodak BioMax ML film. Primary antibodies (concentration, source, and supplier) were: anti-syntaxin 1 (1:1000, mouse, Stressgen), anti-pan-Gβ (1:1000, mouse, Transduction Labs), anti-Gγ1 (1:250, rabbit, Santa Cruz), anti-Gγ2 (1:1000, rabbit, Santa Cruz), anti-Gγ3 (1:250, rabbit, Santa Cruz), and anti-Xpress (1:5000, mouse, Invitrogen). Mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) from a goat source were used at 1:2500. All in vitro binding data presented are representative of at least four separate experiments. tsA-201 cells were grown and transfected as previously described (16Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The combinations of transfected cDNA, along with pEGFP(c1) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), are indicated in the text. The solutions and equipment used are as previously described (16Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using Clampfit 3.0 (Axon Instruments) and plotted using Sigmaplot 2000 (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Steady state inactivation curves were fit with the Boltzmann equationI peak (normalized) = 1/(1 + exp ((V − V h)z/25.6)), whereV and V h are the conditioning and the half-inactivation potential, respectively, and z is the slope factor. Prepulse facilitation ratios (30Elmslie K.S. Zhou W. Jones S.W. Neuron. 1990; 5: 75-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) were used to assess the level of G-protein inhibition of the channels, whereI(+PP)/I(−PP) is the measure of peak current with prepulse over peak current without prepulse. As described previously (26Jarvis S.E. Magga J. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E.A. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), cells were held at −100 mV and depolarized to +20 mV with (+PP) or without (−PP) prior application of a 50-ms depolarizing prepulse to +150 mV. All error bars presented reflect standard errors, pvalues reflect Student's t tests, or when stated, one way analysis of variances. We have previously reported that coexpression of syntaxin 1A, but not syntaxin 1B, with N-type (α1B + α2-δ1+ β1b) calcium channels in tsA-201 cells results in a tonic G-protein inhibition of the channels that can be reversed following application of a strong depolarizing prepulse (26Jarvis S.E. Magga J. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E.A. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Lü Q. AtKisson M.S. Jarvis S.E. Feng Z.P. Zamponi G.W. Dunlap K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2949-2957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A), with the degree of prepulse relief being an indication of the total degree of G-protein inhibition of the channel. The effect of syntaxin 1A could be antagonized following coexpression of either the carboxyl-terminal fragment of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (β-ARKct, a potent Gβγ sink), or the synaptic protein interaction (synprint) motif of the N-type calcium channel II–III linker region (16Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together with biochemical evidence that syntaxin 1A could interact simultaneously with both Gβ and the synprint region, we previously proposed that syntaxin 1A might perhaps co-localize G-proteins and the N-type calcium channel α1 subunit, thereby allowing effective G-protein inhibition of the channel (26Jarvis S.E. Magga J. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E.A. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This might suggest that the inability of syntaxin 1B to induce tonic G-protein inhibition of the channels is because of a lack of syntaxin 1B binding to either the channel or Gβγ. To test these possibilities, we first examined the ability of recombinant His6-tagged synprint motif to bind to immobilized GS"
https://openalex.org/W2080727313,"In the diaphragm muscle we tested the hypothesis that MAP kinase signaling pathways are activated by mechanical stress and such signaling pathways are dependent on the direction in which mechanical stress is applied. Although equal magnitudes of mechanical stress were applied axially and transversely a greater level of activation of ERK1/2, p38, Raf-1, p90 RSK, Elk-1, and the DNA binding activity of AP-1 transcription factor was produced when the muscle was stretched transversely than when stretched axially. A significant up-regulation in protein tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in axially or transversely loaded diaphragm muscles and the activation of ERK1/2 was completely inhibited by genistein (protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Pretreatment of muscles with wortmannin (phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor), TMB-8 (antagonist of intracellular calcium release), GF109203X (PKC inhibitor), or PD98059 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) blocked the activation of ERK1/2 kinases in response to axial but not to transverse loading. On the other hand, pretreatment of muscles with protein kinase A inhibitors H-7 and KT5720 completely suppressed the activation of ERK1/2 in response to transverse loading only. Taken together with the alterations of MAP kinases and the findings of elevations of downstream transcription targets, our data are consistent with two distinct MAP kinase signal transduction pathways in response to mechanical stress. In the diaphragm muscle we tested the hypothesis that MAP kinase signaling pathways are activated by mechanical stress and such signaling pathways are dependent on the direction in which mechanical stress is applied. Although equal magnitudes of mechanical stress were applied axially and transversely a greater level of activation of ERK1/2, p38, Raf-1, p90 RSK, Elk-1, and the DNA binding activity of AP-1 transcription factor was produced when the muscle was stretched transversely than when stretched axially.

Taken together with the alterations of MAP kinases and the findings of elevations of downstream transcription targets, our data are consistent with two distinct MAP kinase signal transduction pathways in response to mechanical stress. In vivo, skeletal muscles function in a three-dimensional mechanical environment in which forces are generated along the muscle fibers and transmitted transversely across the lateral surfaces of the muscle cell, as well as at the ends of the muscle cell (1Boriek A.M. Capetanaki Y. Hwang W. Officer T. Badshah M. Rodarte J. Tidball J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C46-C52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Any elastic sheet of muscle that is mechanically loaded in the direction of the muscle fibers may have a length-tension relationship that is altered from when the sheet is also mechanically loaded in the direction orthogonal to the muscle fibers (2Boriek A.M. Rodarte J.R. Hlastala M.P. Robertson H.T. Complexities in Structure and Function of the Lung. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 181-203Google Scholar). Force transmission in skeletal muscles varies greatly with muscle fiber architecture (3Boriek A.M. Ortize J. Zhu D. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 4Boriek A.M. Zhu D. Zeller M. Rodarte J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: R156-R165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle fibers may be organized in parallel, in series, or in a complex multipinnate arrangement. Muscle fibers in the mouse diaphragm span the entire length of the muscle and they are arranged in parallel. However,in vivo, the diaphragm unlike most other skeletal muscles is mechanically loaded biaxially. That is, in vivo, the diaphragm is subjected to stresses in the direction of the muscle fibers and in the direction perpendicular to the fibers in the plane of the muscle sheet. Therefore, length tension in the direction of the muscle fibers and transverse to the fibers are important in mediating signal transduction.The network of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used for: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK1/2, extracellular-regulated kinase-1 and 2; JNK1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; p90 RSK, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AP-1, activator protein-1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, protein kinase A; CaMKII, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; SA, stretch-activated; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; N, newton; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase. 1The abbreviations used for: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK1/2, extracellular-regulated kinase-1 and 2; JNK1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; p90 RSK, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AP-1, activator protein-1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, protein kinase A; CaMKII, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; SA, stretch-activated; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; N, newton; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase. kinases is a very complex signaling system and it acts in many different physiological processes, such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and development. Recent evidence has shown that mechanical stresses or forces alter the growth and differentiation of a number of tissues and cells (5Kippenberger S. Bernd A. Loitsch S. Guschel M. Muller J.

The mechanism that relates the mechanical forces with the response of skeletal muscle cells has been investigated recently and several signaling molecules have been demonstrated to play significant roles in mechanical force-initiated signal transduction (8Ingber D.E. Biol. Bull. 1998; 194: 323-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Among them are the MAP kinases, which are activated by mechanical stresses. Activation of MAP kinases may link the effects of mechanical stress to the biochemical responses and gene expression (9Bogoyevitch M.A. Ketterman A.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29710-29717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 10Suzuma I. Suzuma K. Ueki K. Hata Y. Feener E.P. King G.L. Aiello L.P. J. Biol.

Invest. 1998; 101: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The MAP kinases act via the regulation of several transcription factors initiating the expression of a variety of immediate and delayed response genes (12Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Dunn M.J. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1187-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 13Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, three parallel pathways of MAP kinases have been described, i.e. extracellular signal related kinase (ERK1/2), protein kinase 38 (p38), and c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs). These kinases require dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by specific upstream protein kinase. JNK and p38 are often referred to as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK1/JNK and SAPK2/p38), and ERK1/2 are often described as the kinases involved in growth factor stimulation (14Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar, 15Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar).The physiologic significance of activation of MAP kinases by mechanical forces is not yet understood. In particular, it is not known whether in skeletal muscles mechanical forces activate specific transcription factors, e.g. activator protein-1 (AP-1). AP-1 is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and response to various environmental stimuli (16Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar, 17Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). AP-1 consists of a homodimer and heterodimers of members of the Jun family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and heterodimers of the Jun and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2) families (18Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Activation of AP-1 leads to its binding to the DNA at consensus sites that in turn regulate the transcription of AP-1-dependent genes (18Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 19Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that the activity of AP-1 is regulated at least in part by the MAP kinase signaling pathways (20Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 21Wisdom R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of several components of AP-1 transcription factor such as c-Jun, activating transcription factor 2, c-Fos, and Elk-1 is increased upon their phosphorylation by ERK1/2 and JNKs (20Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar).Although, recently it has been established that mechanical stress activates the ERK1/2, JNKs, and p38 MAP kinases in skeletal muscle cells (22Wretman C.

Physiol. 1999; 87: 1668-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the pathways that are involved in the activation of these kinases in response to mechanical stress remain unknown. Furthermore, most of the studies on the activation of MAP kinases were carried out in vitro using hind limb muscle cells, which are loaded in vivo along the direction of the long axis of the muscle fibers. In contrast, the diaphragm muscle is mechanically loadedin vivo with transdiaphragmatic pressure, and therefore, its muscles are subjected to mechanical forces not only in the direction of the muscle fibers but also in the direction transverse to the fibers (1Boriek A.M. Capetanaki Y. Hwang W. Officer T. Badshah M. Rodarte J. Tidball J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C46-C52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore important to investigate the effects of mechanical forces applied to the diaphragm muscle axially and transversely. In the present study we investigated the mechanism of activation of ERK1/2 in response to constant static stretch applied either in the axial direction of the muscle fibers or in the transverse direction of the fibers. Additionally, we also report the effects of mechanical stretch on the activity of AP-1 and Elk-1 transcription factors in muscle fibers of the diaphragm.DISCUSSIONWe show that the diaphragm muscle responses to mechanical stress by activating the ERK1/2, JNKs, and p38 MAP kinases. Furthermore, the mechanical stress activates the Raf and the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90 RSK) as well as the transcription factors AP-1 and Elk-1. We also show that there are two distinct signaling pathways activated in response to mechanical stress applied axially and transversely to muscle fibers of the diaphragm. In particular, our data show that PI3K, PKC, and MEK1/2 are activated when the mechanical stress of the diaphragm is applied axially but not activated when stress is applied transversely. On the other hand, cyclic AMP-dependent PKA is activated only in response to transverse mechanical stress. This is despite the fact that we applied the same magnitude of mechanical stress axially and transversely to the muscle fibers.Mechanism of Activation of ERK1/2 Signaling Pathways by Axial and Transverse Loading of Diaphragm MuscleThe diaphragm is mechanically loaded in vivo with transdiaphragmatic pressure, and therefore, its muscles are subjected to mechanical forces not only in the direction of the muscle fibers but also in the direction transverse to the fibers. Therefore, it is important to study mechanical signal transduction not only when mechanical stress is applied along the muscle fibers but also when mechanical stress is applied in the transverse direction to the fibers. Our experiments were conducted such that mechanical stress was applied in either the direction of the muscle fibers or transverse to the fibers. In our experimental protocols axial stress applied to the muscle was essentially the same as that applied transversely, and data in Fig. 1show that this resulted in mechanical stretch that is about twice as much in the axial direction than in the transverse fiber direction. The stress-strain relationships shown in Fig. 1 clearly demonstrate that muscle compliance is small and extensibility is less in the transverse direction to the muscle fibers compared with those in the direction of the muscle fibers. That is when mechanical stress was applied equally in either direction the resistance to mechanical stretch is greater in the transverse direction of the muscle fibers than in the direction of the fibers. The greater activation of ERK1/2, p38, and Raf-1 kinases, as well as the transcription factors, AP-1 and Elk-1, in response to transverse mechanical stress are consistent with greater transverse muscle stiffness compared with axial stiffness.Earlier reports have shown that mechanical tension alone can regulate cell growth and metabolism and the intracellular signaling proteins may link changes in the tension to this cellular adaptation (46Vandenburgh H. Kaufman S. Science. 1979; 203: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that mechanical stress stimulates the signaling pathways of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 MAP kinases in a variety of cell lines including skeletal muscle cells (8Ingber D.E. Biol. Bull. 1998; 194: 323-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Bogoyevitch M.A. Ketterman A.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol.

In all these studies, however, the investigators applied axial stress to myocytes isolated from hind limb muscles. In agreement with these studies we found that axial mechanical stress activates ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38 MAP kinase. Additionally, we have shown that mechanical stress activates p90 RSK and Elk-1, the downstream targets of ERK1/2.In recent years, the effect of mechanical axial stress on cell growth and regulation of expression of several genes has been investigated. However, there is little published work directed toward understanding the biochemical signaling pathways initiated by different mechanical stresses. The ERK pathways involve the sequential phosphorylation and activation of serine kinase Raf, MAP kinase (MEK1/2), and two ERK isoforms (ERK1/ERK2). The ERK1/2 phosphorylate and activate cytosolic substrates such as p90 RSK and nuclear transcription factors such as c-Myc, Elk-1, and c-Fos (14Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The use of specific inhibitors has been a powerful tool in delineation of the downstream MAP signaling in response to numerous stimuli. It has been reported that PD98059 is a highly specific inhibitor of MEK1/2 with very little inhibition reported on other members of MAP kinase family (37Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar, 38Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Our results using PD98059 suggest the involvement of MEK1/2 in the activation of ERK1/2 only in response to axial stress. Interestingly, PD98059 did not have any effect on the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 in response to transverse stress indicating that different kinases might be involved in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 during transverse loading of the diaphragm muscle. This is further supported by a higher level of activation of ERK1/2 in response to transverse stress as compared with axial stress. Although, ERK1/2 have been proposed to be the direct phosphorylation target of the MEK1/2 in the classical signal transduction, this pathway is not a universal phenomenon. Signal transduction in cells involves cross-talk, interconnection between signaling pathways, and shared substrates among multiple enzymes (47Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar,48Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to either form of mechanical stress also led to an increase in the activation of p90 RSK. Similar to ERK1/2 treatment with PD98059 completely inhibited the activation of p90 RSK in response to axial stress, whereas no effect was observed in the case of transverse loading. These results suggest that application of mechanical stress triggers the activation of p90 RSK via the ERK1/2 mechanism. PD98059 did not affect the activity of JNK1 and p38 MAP kinase (data not shown), suggesting that ERK1/2 are the only MAP kinases that are phosphorylated by MEK1/2 in response to axial mechanical stress and the activity of JNKs and p38 MAP kinase is regulated by different pathways. Indeed, the cell signaling pathways that activate JNK1 and p38 MAP kinases in response to various stimuli have been well established (14Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar), however, the pathways that lead to the activation of JNKs and p38 MAP kinase in response to mechanical loading remain unknown.Despite a great deal of research in the last decade, the mechanotransduction remains poorly understood. In the absence of specific cell surface receptors, it remained unclear how mechanical forces are converted into intracellular signals coupled with nuclear gene expression. Some investigators have proposed that transduction of mechanical signals to biological signals occur via the extracellular matrix/integrin/cytoskeletal axis (7Ruwhof C. van der Laarse A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 49Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). Mechanical stress causes deformation of the sarcolemma, which may directly or indirectly cause conformational changes in protein (and subsequent activation of them) that are anchored to the inner surface of cell membranes, or in transmembrane proteins. Several effectors enzyme such as protein-tyrosine kinases, phospholipases, and protein kinase C isoenzymes, ion channels, such as the SA channels, are examples of sarcolemmal proteins that might be affected by mechanical stresses (7Ruwhof C. van der Laarse A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar).To understand the upstream events that lead to the activation of MAP kinases in response to axial and transverse mechanical loading, we investigated the role of several effector molecules and second messengers. Interestingly, there was a significant increase in the protein tyrosine phosphorylation of an approximately 67-kDa protein upon the application of mechanical stress to the diaphragm muscle. The phosphorylation level, however, was much higher in transversely loaded diaphragm muscle as compared with axially loaded muscle. Furthermore, there was an additional tyrosine phosphorylation of an approximately 85-kDa protein in transversely loaded diaphragm muscle (Fig.6 A). The protein tyrosine phosphorylation seems to be required for the activation of ERK1/2 in response to both axial and transverse loading as the inhibition of protein-tyrosine kinases activity by genistein abrogated the mechanical stress-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in diaphragm muscle (Fig. 6 B). What role protein-tyrosine kinase plays in the activation of ERK1/2 in response to mechanical stress remains a subject of much speculation. Some recent reports, however, suggested that focal adhesion kinase, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, localized at focal adhesion is involved in mechanosensing in fibroblast and endothelial cells (50Wang H.B. Dembo M. Hanks S.K. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11295-11300Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 51Pelham Jr., R.J. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13661-13665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Several other reports also suggested that members of Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases such as c-Src constitute a part of the mechanotransduction in endothelial cells in response to shear stress (Ref. 52Chen K.D. Li Y.S. Kim M. Li S. Yuan S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18393-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, and references therein). Although, the nature of protein-tyrosine kinase is not known at present, our data suggest that protein-tyrosine kinase are involved in stress-induced activation of ERK1/2 in the diaphragm muscle.Another striking observation of the present investigation is the involvement of PKC in response to axial stress whereas PKA was involved in response to transverse stress. The activation of ERK1/2 of the diaphragm muscle in response to applied axial but not transverse mechanical stress requires the intracellular mobilization of Ca2+ ions as antagonist of intracellular Ca2+TMB-8 blocked the activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 8). ERK1/2 activation in response to either axial or transverse stress does not involve SA channels or the extracellular Ca2+ influx (data not shown). Furthermore, the inhibition of PKC activity also led to the inhibition of ERK1/2 activation in response to axial loading only (Fig.9 C), suggesting that Ca2+ ions plays an important role in mediating the cellular response in axial loading of skeletal muscle fibers. In addition to increasing the activity of PKC, elevation of free Ca2+ level in the cells also results in its binding and activation of calmodulin (CaM), which consequently modulates the activity of protein kinases and phosphatases (40Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2311-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Soderling T.R. Stull J.T. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2341-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One such enzyme Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) that has broad substrate specificity and mediates various biological responses (53Zhi G. Abdullah S.M. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8951-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) is, however, not involved because the inhibition of CaMKII with KT-93 did not alter the activation of ERK1/2 in response to mechanical stress (Fig. 8,right panel).In contrast to axial loading, the activation of Ca2+ ions or PKC is not required for the activation of ERK1/2 in response to transverse loading. Instead, cyclic AMP-dependent PKA is needed for the activation of ERK1/2 in response to transverse loading. PKA mediates several of the effects of the elevated levels of cAMP in the cells and has been reported to both activate and inhibit the ERK1/2 signaling pathway either directly or through the activation of Rap1 (45Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Although both PKA and PKC can modulate the activity of ERK1/2 pathways by phosphorylation of Raf kinases, PKA preferentially targets B-Raf, whereas PKC alters the activity of the Raf-1 isoform (7Ruwhof C. van der Laarse A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 45Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).PI3K, a lipid kinase complex, is another important regulatory protein that is involved in the initiation of different signaling pathways and regulating the major functions of the cell (55Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 56Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The precise role of PI3K in MAP kinase signaling pathways is not very clear. Both PI3K-dependent and PI3K-independent activation of MAP kinases has been reported (57Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 58Kranenburg O.

Hirai S. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki A. Kosaka K. Ohno S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Ikeda et al. (62Ikeda M. Kito H. Sumpio B.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have shown that the activation of ERK1/2 in endothelial cells in response to cyclic strain is dependent on the PI3K and p21ras. Similar to these findings our results with wortmannin suggest that the activation of ERK1/2 pathways in response to axial stress of the diaphragm involves PI3K (Fig. 7). However, the same is not true in the case of transverse loading. We did not get any inhibition in the activation of ERK1/2 in response to transverse loading by wortmannin even when it was used at higher concentrations (up to 1 μm, not shown). How PI3K regulates the activation of ERK/12 in response to axial mechanical stress remains speculative. The main effectors of PI3K include the mitogen transducing signaling proteins (protein kinase C, phosphoinoside-dependent kinases, and small G-proteins) that are activated either via their interaction with the lipid products of PI3K such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-P3 or PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of proteins. Activation of PI3K activates phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, which can directly or along with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-P3 modulate the activity of various isoform of PKC (7Ruwhof C. van der Laarse A.

https://openalex.org/W2101083444,"Cytoskeleton-associated proteins (CAPs) are involved in the organization of microtubules and transportation of vesicles and organelles along the cytoskeletal network. A conserved motif, CAP-Gly, has been identified in a number of CAPs, including CLIP-170 and dynactins. The crystal structure of the CAP-Gly domain ofCaenorhabditis elegans F53F4.3 protein, solved by single wavelength sulfur-anomalous phasing, revealed a novel protein fold containing three β-sheets. The most conserved sequence, GKNDG, is located in two consecutive sharp turns on the surface, forming the entrance to a groove. Residues in the groove are highly conserved as measured from the information content of the aligned sequences. The C-terminal tail of another molecule in the crystal is bound in this groove. Cytoskeleton-associated proteins (CAPs) are involved in the organization of microtubules and transportation of vesicles and organelles along the cytoskeletal network. A conserved motif, CAP-Gly, has been identified in a number of CAPs, including CLIP-170 and dynactins.

Residues in the groove are highly conserved as measured from the information content of the aligned sequences. The C-terminal tail of another molecule in the crystal is bound in this groove. The cytoskeleton maintains the hierarchy of a eukaryotic cell to control the spatial distribution and the movement of vesicles, organelles, and large protein complexes. It mainly involves three types of protein filaments: microtubules, intermediate filaments, and actin filaments. There are extensive interactions between the filaments mediated by a large number of cytoskeleton-associated proteins (1Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 63-71Google Scholar, 2Houseweart M.K. Cleveland D.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R864-R866Google Scholar). For instance, microtubules and actin filaments are cross-linked by microtubule-associated proteins such as myosin-kinesin complexes, myosin-CLIP-170 complexes, and dynein-dynactin complexes (1Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 63-71Google Scholar, 3Fuchs E. Yang Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 547-550Google Scholar). These protein molecules or molecular assemblies have one end that binds to the microtubule and the another end that binds to different vesicles or organelles. Movements related to nucleus positioning or mitotic spindle orientation are orchestrated between microtubules and actin filaments through dynamic interactions of different cytoskeleton-associated proteins. The cytoskeleton is a dynamic network that disassembles and reassembles constantly according to functional requirements. Regulation of the dynamic assembly of the cytoskeleton and motor proteins involves other non-motor accessory proteins. The term “+TIPS” has recently been proposed to describe microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins (4Schuyler S.C. Pellman D. Cell. 2001; 105: 421-424Google Scholar). This class of proteins tends to localize to the plus end of microtubules, and these proteins are the most conserved microtubule-associated proteins. One common motif, named glycine-rich cytoskeleton-associated protein (CAP-Gly) 1The abbreviations used are: CAP, cytoskeleton-associated protein; CAP-Gly, glycine-rich CAP; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ISAS, iterative single wavelength anomalous signal. domain, was first discovered in restin (or CLIP-170), the prototype +TIP, and three other proteins (5Riehemann K. Sorg C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 82-83Google Scholar). This domain is present in a Pfam family of 69 proteins (6Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the CAP-Gly domain is conserved from the simple single cell eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the human being. The functions of this family of proteins are mostly hypothetical. They are grouped together because of the existence of this CAP-Gly domain. Therefore, the CAP-Gly domain must have a signature role in this protein family. The CAP-Gly domain can appear once or multiple times in one protein, either in the N terminus or the C terminus. It can also be found in some motor-associated proteins, such as dynactin chain 1 (7Collin G.B. Nishina P.M. Marshall J.D. Naggert J.K. Genomics. 1998; 53: 359-364Google Scholar) and Drosophilakinesin-73 (8Li H.P. Liu Z.M. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1086-1091Google Scholar). The two CAP-Gly domains in CLIP-170 located at the N terminus were shown to mediate the binding of the CLIP-170 protein to the microtubules (9Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of CLIP-170 carries the domains for organelle binding, suggesting that CLIP-170 is a microtubule-organelle linker protein (10Scheel J. Pieer P. Rickard J.E. Diamantopoulos G.S. Valetti C. van der Goot F.G. Haner M. Aebi U. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25883-25891Google Scholar). The CAP-Gly domains of CLIP-170 bind specifically to the growing (plus) end of the microtubule (11Perez F. Diamantopoulos G.S. Stalder R. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 517-527Scopus (328) Google Scholar), whereas the opposite end of CLIP-170 mediates interactions with dynactin (12Vaughan K.T. Tynan S.H. Faulkner N.E. Echeverri C.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1437-1447Google Scholar) or myosin (13Lantz V.A. Miller K.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 897-910Google Scholar). This characteristic feature might allow CLIP proteins to participate in the dynamic control of cargo transport along microtubules or between microtubules and actin filaments. The genome of Caenorhabditis elegans has been completely sequenced, and several proteins were predicted to have a CAP-Gly domain based on homology. The genes from C. elegans have been selected as targets by the Southeast Collaboratory for Structural Genomics (14Norvell J.C. Machalek A.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7 (suppl.): 931Google Scholar). Here we report the structure solution of the CAP-Gly domain of the C. elegans F53F4.3 protein with a novel fold, which provided an example for how high throughput x-ray crystallography might impact on our knowledge of new genes identified from genome sequencing. Based on the annotation of the C. elegans genome performed by theC. elegans sequencing consortium (15The C. E. S. Consortium Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Google Scholar), primers were designed for cloning all predicted cDNAs into an ENTRY vector in the GATEWAY coning system (Invitrogen) (16Walhout A.J. Temple G.F. Brasch M.A. Hartley J.L. Lorson M.A. van den Heuvel S. Vidal M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 575-592Google Scholar). Our group then took these ENTRY vectors and systematically recombined them with an expression vector, pDEST 17.1, in a 96-well format. Recombinant protein expression of each vector was screened, and vectors that expressed soluble proteins inEscherichia coli were selected. F53F4.3 was one of the selected vectors that produced a high amount of soluble protein when protein expression in E. coli was induced at 18 °C. This expression vector produced a protein that has a hexahistidine tag and an 8-amino acid peptide in front of the N terminus and an 8-amino acid peptide following the C terminus of the gene. The His tag was included for purification by a nickel affinity column, and both 8-amino acid peptides at each terminus were the result of the recombination reaction during cloning (16Walhout A.J. Temple G.F. Brasch M.A. Hartley J.L. Lorson M.A. van den Heuvel S. Vidal M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 575-592Google Scholar). After nickel affinity, fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration (S-75, Amersham Biosciences), and ion exchange (Resource Q, Amersham Biosciences) chromatography purification, the purified protein was concentrated to about 10 mg/ml for crystal screening in a robotic system. Before any crystals were produced, it was noticed that the purified F53F4.3 protein had been cleaved into two halves in the solution stored at 4 °C. The fragments were isolated from the SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis for their molecular weights and automated N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The C-terminal fragment corresponds to residues 121–229 and was subsequently cloned into a pET 28b vector (Novagen) for protein expression. The resulting protein with a hexahistidine tag, a thrombin cleavage site in front of the N terminus of the fragment, and no extra amino acids at the C terminus was purified by the same protocol and subjected to crystal screen. Large single crystals (∼0.5 mm) were observed when the reservoir solution contained 1.8 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m MES buffer at pH 6.5. Removal of the His tag by thrombin cleavage did not appear to affect crystallization. Diffraction data were collected with crystals prepared using proteins without the His tag. Data for phasing were collected to 2.5-Å resolution on a single crystal and flash-cooled to 100 K at beamline ID-17 (IMCA-CAT), Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory using a MarResearch 165-mm CCD detector and 1.74-Å X-rays following the protocol described in Liu et al. (17Liu Z.J. Vysotski E.S. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Lee J. Wang B.C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2085-2093Google Scholar). HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine a data collection strategy (99% completion), and data collection was divided into four passes. The first and third passes cover one anomalous diffraction wedge (86–146°), whereas the second and fourth passes cover the other anomalous diffraction wedge (266–326°). The oscillation angle was 1° per frame for all the passes. Data processing was carried out using HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). The processed data from different passes were then merged.

Open table in a new tab Low resolution data (3.5 Å) were used to locate the sulfur atom sites. A total of 1707 Bijvoet reflection pairs greater than 2ς, between 20.0 and 3.5-Å resolution (Bijvoet difference R-factor was 1.5%), were used to determine three sulfur atom positions (see Fig. 3A) with SOLVE V1.16 (19Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 530-537Google Scholar). These three sulfur sites could also be easily determined by the program SHELXD (20Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 463-466Google Scholar). PHASES (21Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Google Scholar) was then used to refine the sulfur positions and to locate one additional sulfur site by Bijvoet difference Fourier analysis. These heavy atom sites correspond to sulfur atoms of two cysteines, a sulfur atom of one methionine, and a possible Cl− ion in the solvent region based on the final refined protein structure. All heavy atom sites were treated as sulfur for the phase calculations. The four sulfur sites were used to resolve the enantiomorphic space groups P6122 and P6522. The handedness test feature in ISAS2001 (22Wang B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 90-112Google Scholar) was used at 20.0–3.5-Å resolution to identify P6122 as the correct space group because of the high figure-of-merit and low map-inversion R-value. The same four sulfur sites were used to estimate the protein phases at 3.0-Å resolution using iterative single wavelength anomalous signal (ISAS) (22Wang B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 90-112Google Scholar). After three filters and two cycles of phase extension, the final average figure-of-merit and map-inversion R-value were 0.73 and 0.281, respectively. The original electron density map is shown in Fig. 3B, in which the polypeptide chain could be traced for about 65 residues. After a poly-Ala model was fitted into the density, the original phases and the calculated phases from the poly-Ala model were provided to wARP program (23Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7 (suppl.): 978-981Google Scholar) with diffraction data between 50–1.8 Å collected on a Raxis IV detector mounted on a Rigaku RU300 generator. A new poly-Ala model with 95 residues was generated. Sequence assignment and refinement were carried out with the programs O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar) and XPLOR3.5 (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The final model of 109 residues was refined against a data set to 1.77-Å resolution collected at APS (see Table I). Crystals of the wild type recombinant F53F4.3 protein (residues 121–292) were grown in conditions found in a robotic screen using the 96-well sitting drop plates. The optimal reservoir solution consisted of 1.8 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m MES buffer at pH 6.5. The protein drop contained 5 μl of the reservoir solution and 5 μl of the protein solution at 10 mg/ml concentration in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Crystals of 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.3 mm in size appeared in the drops in 4 days at room temperature. The space group was determined to be P6122 with a = b = 64.16 Å, c = 101.95 Å from x-ray diffraction data collected on a Raxis-IV image plate detector (MSC). To obtain phases for solving the crystal structure, the ISAS method was employed (22Wang B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 90-112Google Scholar). It has been argued that the anomalous signal from the sulfur atoms present in the wild type proteins would be sufficient for phase determination using only single wavelength x-ray data (17Liu Z.J. Vysotski E.S. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Lee J. Wang B.C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2085-2093Google Scholar). To collect x-ray diffraction data with high accuracy required for the ISAS method, crystals of F53F4.3 were cryo-frozen at 100 °F, and x-ray data were collected at the wavelength of 1.74 Å to increase the anomalous signal from sulfur atoms while minimizing crystal damage. After screening a number of crystals, a data set to 2.5-Å resolution was completed from the best crystal. This data set to the moderate resolution limit was collected for phasing only. Three sulfur atom positions could be located by the SOLVE program using SAS data. The Patterson peaks corresponding to the sulfur sites were clearly visible (Fig. 1A). A fourth site was found in further refinement. Phases derived from these anomalous sites were refined and extended by solvent flattening (22Wang B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 90-112Google Scholar). An electron density map was calculated, and polypeptide chain tracing and some side chain identification were possible (Fig. 1B). A complete structure model corresponding to residues 135–229 was built in steps and refined to 1.77 Å using a high resolution data set and the X-plor program (26Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven and London1992Google Scholar). The structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The C-terminal domain of F53F4.3 is roughly spherical with a three-layer β/β structure (Fig. 2). The ordered part of the N terminus has a 9-residue α-helix (Asp-135–Lys-144) with relatively higher average temperature factors. This α-helix was preceded by 17 disordered residues that do not make any stable contacts with the rest of this domain and could be available for intermolecular interactions. The three-layer β/β structure contains seven antiparallel β-strands. The first layer consists of β1, β2a, and β7. The second layer starts with the extension of β-strand 2 (β2b) and continues with β3 and β6. The last layer contains β4 and β5. The topology of the CAP-Gly domain could be defined as three antiparallel β-sheets of 3-3-2 strands. The two three-stranded sheets are L-shaped to each other with the last strand of the first sheet extended continuously to the first strand of the second sheet. The two-stranded sheet is on top of the second three-stranded sheet. The C-terminal 6 residues (Leu-224 to Ile-229) protrude out of the globular domain. Considering the disordered residues at the N terminus prior to the α-helix, the CAP-Gly domain appears to be a rigidly packed motif in the middle of two extended polypeptides. The structure of this domain is likely to represent a new protein fold. A search for three-dimensional homology (27Gibrat J.-F. Madej T. Bryant S.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 377-385Google Scholar) found no similar structures from the non-redundant subset of the Protein Data Bank. The sequence of the F53F4.3 domain was provided to the EBI server (www.ebi.ac.uk/fasta33) to search the Swiss Protein Database using the FASTA alignment method (28Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Google Scholar). The 58 aligned sequences, ranging from 55 to 22% identity, corresponded to the CAP-Gly motif (5Riehemann K. Sorg C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 82-83Google Scholar, 29Watanabe T.K. Shimizu F. Nagata M. Kawai A. Fujiwara T. Nakamura Y. Takahashi E. Hirai Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 72: 208-211Google Scholar). The Shannon information content (30Karlin S. Altschul S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2264-2268Google Scholar) is used as the measure of sequence conservation (Fig. 3A). This rigorous statistical procedure compares each position in the given alignment with the probability of randomly distributed amino acids weighted by the observed distribution of each amino acid in the C. elegansgenome. A variety of structural alphabets may be employed in this analysis, for example, grouping the amino acids by charge or chemical class. The data presented here treat each of the 20 amino acids independently. A portion of the alignment and its annotation are shown in Fig. 3B. The longest stretch of highly conserved sequence corresponds to Gly-189 to Gly-193, which is located at the surface of the domain between β3 and β4. This 5-residue GKNDG segment is conserved in most homologous sequences except in a few sequences where the asparagine is substituted by a histidine or the aspartic acid is substituted by a serine. A loop structure opposite to this conservative stretch, Val-156 to Met-160, has higher average temperature factors, indicating that this part of the structure may be flexible. This is a highly variable region among the homologous sequences, which could present a characteristic recognition site for other protein interactions if the conserved stretch is to associate with the cytoskeleton. There is a conserved aromatic cluster including Tyr-168, Phe-174, Trp-179, Tyr-200, Phe-201, and Phe-210. The hydrophobic cluster may represent a stabilizing core structure. There is also a significant groove adjacent to the conserved 189–193 loop. The groove is lined by 12 residues: Val-156, Gln-159, Arg-162, Phe-174, Trp-179, Tyr-184, Lys-190, Asn-191, Val-195, Gly-209, Phe-210, and Val-211. Some of the hydrophobic residues are part of the conserved hydrophobic cluster, such as Phe-174, Trp-179, and Phe-210. A number of their main chain and side chain atoms are solvent-accessible. In the crystal lattice, the extended C terminus of one molecule is packed into the groove of a symmetry-related molecule. The side chain of residue Glu-228 forms a buried salt bridge with Arg-162 and a hydrogen bond with residue Tyr-184. Residue 162 or its neighbor is usually basic according to the sequence alignment. Hydrogen bonds are also formed between the main chain atoms of residue Ile-229 and the symmetry-related molecule. Lys-190 is also close to the acidic C terminus. The CAP-Gly domains contain a large number of conserved glycine residues. Two of them, Gly-193 and Gly-197, are involved in the formation of two consecutive sharp turns with the second one as a type II β-turn. This unique double-turn motif exposes the most conserved region (GKNDG) in the CAP-Gly domain. The residue after the GKNDG sequence is often a serine/threonine, which forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of residue Asp-192. Other conserved glycine residues include: Gly-170 and Gly-177, which are involved in bending β2b and β3, resulting in the loop connecting β2b and β3 to be perpendicular; Gly-189, which is in the middle of an extended loop containing the most conserved stretch; Gly-181, which is packed closely to the conserved Phe-210 (3.5 Å); and Gly-208 to Phe-201 (4 Å). These conserved glycine residues may be required for maintaining the folding of the three-layer sheet. The crystal structure of a widely distributed CAP-Gly domain is reported to high resolution. This domain was isolated from the C. elegans F53F4.3 protein when expressed in E. coli. Based on previous sequence alignment, the CAP-Gly domain was proposed to contain 52 amino acids (Pfam: PF01302) (5Riehemann K. Sorg C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 82-83Google Scholar). These 52 amino acids constitute the conserved core region of this domain. However, the crystal structure revealed that this domain consists of 84 amino acids in this protein. One α-helix and three β-sheets form a novel protein fold not observed previously. Two conserved regions are identified on the surface based on information content analysis of the amino acid sequences from this protein family. A surface loop containing residues 193–197 (GKNDG) could present itself for interaction with the microtubule. The second feature is a groove that was occupied in our crystal structure by the C terminus of a neighboring molecule. A helix at the N terminus is loosely formed in this crystal structure and is located upstream from the CAP-Gly domain of C. elegans F53F4.3. The function of F53F4.3 is unknown inC. elegans. The CAP-Gly domain was first identified by comparing CLIP-170 (or restin), a filament-associated protein abundant in the tumoral cells characteristic for Hodgkin's disease (31Bilbe G. Delabie J. Bruggen J. Richener H. Asselbergs F.A. Cerletti N. Sorg C. Odink K. Tarcsay L. Wiesendanger W. et al.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2103-2113Google Scholar), with other proteins known to be cytoskeleton-associated proteins (5Riehemann K. Sorg C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 82-83Google Scholar). Recently, this motif of three repeats was also found in the familial cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene CYLD (32Bignell G.R. Warren W. Seal S. Takahashi M. Rapley E. Barfoot R.H.G. Brown C. Biggs P.J. Lakhani S.R. Jones C. Hansen J. Blair E. Hofmann B. Siebert R. Turner G. Evans D.G. Schrander-Stumpel C. Beemer F.A. van den Ouweland A. Halley D. Delpech B. Cleveland M.G. Leigh I. Leisti J. Rasmussen S. Wallace M.R. Fenske C. Banerjee P. Oiso N. Chaggar R. Merrett S. Leonard N. Huber M. Hohl D. Chapman P. Burn J. Swift S. Smith A. Ashworth A. Stratton M.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 160-165Google Scholar). Most proteins contain only one CAP-Gly motif, whereas some may have two or three. The wide distribution of the CAP-Gly motif in cytoskeleton-associated proteins suggests that this domain could be a common adhesive domain for attachment to microtubules. For instance, the cytoplasmic linker protein CLIP-170 was shown to be required for the binding of endocytic vesicles to microtubules in vitro and to be colocalized with endocytic organelles in vivo (9Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Google Scholar). There are two CAP-Gly domains in CLIP-170. When these two domains were deleted from CLIP-170, its binding to microtubules was diminished. The purified CLIP-170 forms an elongated dimer of a central coil-coil structure with its N-terminal domain binding to microtubules (10Scheel J. Pieer P. Rickard J.E. Diamantopoulos G.S. Valetti C. van der Goot F.G. Haner M. Aebi U. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25883-25891Google Scholar). There are three potential structural regions that could interact with the cytoskeleton. First, the conserved patch identified on the surface is central in the CAP-Gly domain, which could offer a point of contact with microtubules. The specially arranged glycine residues render an unusual structure feature protruding out on the protein surface. The highly conserved residues in this region could readily be available to fit into a receptive region on microtubules. Second, a groove that holds the C terminus of the neighboring molecule might also be a candidate for binding the filamentous proteins. In this structure, the ordered residues extend to the last residue of the C terminus. In other CAP-Gly-containing proteins, this domain is usually located in the middle of a long polypeptide chain. The C terminus could represent hypothetically the binding peptide from the cytoskeleton if such a peptide is required for binding. Third, the N terminus of the CAP-Gly domain might be involved in interactions with other cytoskeleton-associated proteins (5Riehemann K. Sorg C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 82-83Google Scholar). The F53F4.3 does not form a dimerin vitro. However, the helix region of the CAP-Gly domain in other CAP-Gly proteins could be more extended and may contain residues that induce coil-coil interactions. Generally speaking, the coil-coil interaction of the CAP-Gly domain, if present, is likely to be with other cytoskeleton accessory proteins or to be involved in dimerization as in CLIP-170 (10Scheel J. Pieer P. Rickard J.E. Diamantopoulos G.S. Valetti C. van der Goot F.G. Haner M. Aebi U. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25883-25891Google Scholar). The helix region has very high B-factor in this structure and is preceded by a long disordered region. It is possible that a helix would only be stable in the formation of a multiplex protein structure. The precise pattern of the CAP-Gly domain interactions with the cytoskeleton remains to be delineated. This new structure, however, could provide the platform for mapping these critical interactions. The CAP-Gly domain could be viewed as a microtubule association module in cytoskeleton-associated proteins that may contain one, two, or three such domains with modularly increased affinity. The adhesive property of the CAP-Gly domain to microtubule is in another sense analogous to that of some DNA binding domains such as zinc fingers (33Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Google Scholar). Both microtubules and DNA are biopolymers. The CAP-Gly domain or zinc fingers are protein modular units that are used for association to the polymer in a consecutive manner depending on the affinity requirement. The specificity for the binding location could be provided by sequence variations of the nonconserved regions or interacting with other regions. The CAP-Gly domain has also been found in dynein/dynactin (P150Glued) complexes. The conventional view is that the motor proteins could get on and off the microtubule by alternated motor domain binding to walk along the filament. The function of the CAP-Gly domain in this mobile complex may be to act as a tether to “glue” the complex on the microtubule. This will keep the traveling complex on the right track without totally falling off the microtubule. We demonstrated here that protein crystal structures could be determined in an HTP manner using the naturally present sulfur sites as anomalous scatterers provided that high quality crystals could be grown. The prerequisite for growing high quality protein crystals is the production of highly purified, rigid, globular protein molecules. It seems inevitable that subcloning of digested fragments from soluble protein preparations is frequently employed to identify the portion of a gene product that would ultimately be crystallized. Sequence analysis of protein homology may not predict the correct structural domain that forms crystals. In this case, the predicted domain was much smaller than the one that was suitable for crystallization. When such a strategy is implemented, novel protein structure folds that are correlated to significant biological functions might be solved without prior sequence-based target selection. Since each protein family classified by sequence homology contains many members, it is difficult to predict which representative member would yield useful crystals for structure determination. Shotgun screening in an HTP manner is an alternative approach to complement other target selection strategies.

The mammalian NimA-related kinase Nek2 forms a complex with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1C). This complex is located at centrosomes and has been implicated in regulation of the cycle of duplication and separation. Inhibitor-2 (Inh2) is an inhibitor protein specific for PP1C, and its expression level fluctuates during the cell cycle. Here we report cellular regulation of the Nek2·PP1C complex by Inh2. PP1C-binding segments of Nek2 were isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening using Inh2 bait. Inh2 indirectly associates with Nek2 via PP1C, which binds to both proteins, forming a bridged heterotrimeric complex. Double Ala mutation of the PP1C-binding site (KVHF) in Nek2 eliminated both PP1C and Inh2 interactions in both a yeast conjugation assay and an in vitro binding assay. The kinase activity of Nek2·PP1C was enhanced 2-fold by addition of recombinant Inh2, with EC50 = 10 nm. Immunofluorescence showed concentration of endogenous Inh2 at centrosomes and in a region surrounding the centrosomes. Transient expression of wild-type Inh2 increased by 5-fold dispersed/split centrosomes in fibroblasts, mimicking the phenotype produced by overexpression of Nek2. Deletion of the Inh2 C-terminal domain yielded Inh2-(1–118), which failed to interact with or activate the Nek2·PP1C complex, suggesting that the C-terminal region of Inh2 is required for regulation of the Nek2·PP1C complex. Thus, Inh2 can enhance the kinase activity of the Nek2·PP1C complex via inhibition of phosphatase activity to initiate centrosome separation.

Thus, Inh2 can enhance the kinase activity of the Nek2·PP1C complex via inhibition of phosphatase activity to initiate centrosome separation. Centrosomes are structures in the eucaryotic cell that function as centers for organizing microtubules (see review in Ref. 1Doxsey S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). During the cell cycle, centrosomes are first duplicated coincident with S phase and then undergo separation at the onset of mitosis and become the spindle poles for chromosome segregation. Recent discoveries have shown that protein phosphorylation is involved in regulation of the centrosome cycle (2Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; PP, protein phosphatase; PP1C, protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit; Inh2, inhibitor-2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MBP, myelin basic protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CTD, C-terminal domain; IBF, Inh2-binding fragment; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; PP, protein phosphatase; PP1C, protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit; Inh2, inhibitor-2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MBP, myelin basic protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CTD, C-terminal domain; IBF, Inh2-binding fragment; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinaseand NimA-related kinase (Nek2) have been implicated in regulation of the centrosome cycle. In particular, Nek2 is the human relative of the NimA protein Ser/Thr kinase first described fromAspergillus and localized at centrosomes (3Schultz S.J. Fry A.M. Sutterlin C. Ried T. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 625-635PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Nek2 gives separation without spindle formation, consistent with a loss of centrosome cohesion (4Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In addition to kinases, the protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) α-isoform is localized at centrosomes (5Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Villa-Moruzzi E. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Indeed, the catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1C) binds to a PP1-binding motif (-KVHF-) in the C-terminal non-catalytic region of Nek2 (6Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Coexpression of PP1 antagonizes Nek2 function via dephosphorylation of Nek2 itself and its substrates, indicating that PP1 acts a negative regulator for centrosome separation (6Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 7Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3749-3757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphorylation of PP1C by Nek2 reduces the phosphatase activity of the complex (6Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, the kinase·phosphatase complex of Nek2·PP1C is expected to function as a bistable switch described by Ferrell (8Ferrell Jr., J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), potentially creating a double-negative feedback circuit for regulation of centrosome dynamics. Phosphatase inhibitor-2 (Inh2) was first described in 1976 as a heat-stable protein that inhibited protein phosphatase activity (9Huang F.L. Glinsmann W. FEBS Lett. 1976; 62: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The specificity of Inh2 was later used for functionally defining type 1versus type 2 Ser/Thr phosphatases (10Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest involvement of Inh2 in cell cycle regulation. The expression level of Inh2 fluctuates during the cell cycle and is enhanced at mitosis (11Brautigan D.L. Sunwoo J. Labbe J.C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Nature. 1990; 344: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of Inh2 occurs in parallel to S phase entry, and Inh2 is retained in the cytoplasm of cells at high density (12Kakinoki Y. Somers J. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32308-32314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Leach C. Eto M. Brautigan D.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3739-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Glc8, a yeast homolog of Inh2, compensates for mutation of Ipl1 kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which suffers severe missegregation of chromosomes during mitosis (14Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, Inh2 seems to function in cell cycle regulation; however, the physiological targets of Inh2 are unknown. The N-terminal IKGI sequence of Inh2 is essential for potent inhibition of monomeric PP1C (15Huang H.-b. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shih S.-R. Tsay H.-J., Li, H.-C. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7870-7878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PP1C associated with regulatory subunits such as the myosin-targeting subunit MYPT1 is insensitive to Inh2, and PP1C is thought to bind either to a targeting subunit or to Inh2, but not to both (16Alessi D. Macdougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 17Yang J. Hurley T.D. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol.

Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The docking sites on PP1C for the IKGI sequence of Inh2 and the (R/K)(V/I)X(F/W) motif of other PP1C regulatory subunits have been mapped adjacent to one another on the back side, opposite the active site, suggesting a competition between Inh2 and regulatory subunits (19Egloff M.P.

Here we report the discovery of binding of Inh2 to the Nek2·PP1 complex and show that this association activates Nek2 kinase. Our results implicate Inh2 as a regulator of the Nek2·PP1C complex and centrosome separation in cells, creating new potential links for coordination of cell cycle signals. Human Inh2 residues 1–197 2The Inh2 constructs used residues 1–197 of a total of 204 to facilitate PCR amplifications by eliminating the GC-rich coding region at the C-terminal end of the protein. The recombinant Inh2-(1–197) protein is indistinguishable in functions from the full-length protein purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and is referred to herein as the recombinant wild-type protein. were cloned into pGBT10 and used to transform yeast strain HF7c, which was sequentially transformed with a randomly primed and size-selected mouse day 9 embryo DNA library cloned into vector pVP16 (Stan Hollenberg, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA). As previously described (21Liu J. Prickett T.D. Elliott E. Meroni G. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6650-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), positives were selected by growth on triple drop-out medium (leu −/trp −/his −) and confirmed by expression of β-galactosidase from an alternate promoter. The DNAs isolated from a two-hybrid screen were cloned into theBamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX4T to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in theEscherichia coli BL21 strain. The DNA for human Inh2 residues 1–197 (12Kakinoki Y. Somers J. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32308-32314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pET30a vector (Novagen) for expression as a fusion protein with an N-terminal hexahistidine plus 44-residue S tag™ (His6S) and into theXbaI site of the pRK7-Myc vector for expression in mammalian cells with an N-terminal Myc epitope tag (sequence EQKLISEEDL) (18Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment of Inh2 encoding residues 1–118 or 14–197 was prepared by PCR methods and inserted into the pET30 or pRK7-Myc vector. Full-length Nek2 was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA prepared from HeLa cells and was subcloned into theBamHI-EcoRI sites of the pRK7-HA3mammalian expression vector, which added an N-terminal triple-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (sequence YPYDVPDYA). Proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-pan PP1C antibody (Transduction Laboratories), affinity-purified sheep anti-Inh2 antibody (13Leach C. Eto M. Brautigan D.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3739-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10, and anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 as previously described (18Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Rabbit lung extracts were prepared by homogenizing tissue in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 (IGEPAL CA-630), 0.4 mm Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol; and the supernatant recovered after centrifugation was used as a source of native PP1C in binding assays. African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) and human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE19) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen) and in DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), respectively, in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For binding and kinase assays with N-terminally triple HA-tagged Nek2 (referred to as HA3-Nek2), each 150-mm dish of COS-7 cells (∼106 cells) was transfected with 8 μg of DNA in 16 μl of NovaFECTORTM (VennNova, LLC, Pompano Beach, FL) for 24 h and then lysed in 2 ml of buffer containing 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630. Aliquots of 0.25 ml were mixed with 5 μg of His6S-Inh2, or 1.0 ml was mixed with 8 μg of monoclonal antibody 12CA5; and bound proteins were recovered by binding to 10 μl of S-proteinTM-agarose (Novagen) or 10 μl of protein-A agarose (Sigma), respectively. Beads were recovered and washed by centrifugation. Nek2 assay used the immunoprecipitate in 20 μl of reaction mixture consisting of 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4 mm Pefabloc plus 0.2 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi/nmol) as substrates. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences) analysis using ImageQuant software. A 100-mm stock plate of COS-7 cells was split 1:8 onto fibronectin-coated 22 × 22-mm coverslips seated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for at least 6 h before transfection. Each 35-mm culture was transiently transfected with 1 μg of either empty green fluorescent protein vector plasmid or plasmid encoding HA3-Nek2 or N-terminally Myc-tagged Inh2 (referred to as Myc-Inh2) using 3 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in serum-free DMEM following the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures were allowed to express protein at least overnight (12 h) before fixing as described to preserve microtubule structure. Transfected cells were stained with antibodies directed against either HA and Myc as well as endogenous γ-tubulin. Untransfected cultures of COS-7 cells in 35-mm dishes were prepared, and the growth medium was replaced either with fresh 10% newborn calf serum-supplemented DMEM or with 10 μm Taxol or 20 μm nocodazole solutions prepared in 10% newborn calf serum-supplemented DMEM. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min for Taxol treatment and for 60 min for nocodazole treatment before fixation and staining. Cells were stained with antibodies directed against endogenous Inh2, γ-tubulin, and β-tubulin. A stage micrometer was used to calibrate the measurement tool in Openlab software (at ×60, 48 pixels = 10 μm; Improvision, Coventry, United Kingdom). Intercentriolar distances in transfected cells were measured with the calibrated measuring tool directly from contrast-enhanced images of γ-tubulin staining. Only those cells with two clearly distinguished foci of γ-tubulin staining were included in the analyses. Cells were rinsed once with 1.2× PEM (1 m PIPES, 50 mm EGTA, and 20 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C, fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 3 min, rinsed twice again with 1.2× PEM, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1.2× PEM for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Various primary monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, including sheep anti-Inh2, anti-Myc (9E10), mouse anti-HA (F7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-γ-tubulin (Sigma), and Cy3-conjugated mouse anti-β-tubulin (Sigma) antibodies, were diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin-containing PBS and applied to the coverslips for at least 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS for 5 min each before staining with the appropriate secondary antibodies, including rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, Oregon Green 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse, and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-sheep antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin-containing PBS and 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were rinsed again three times with PBS as described above and mounted onto glass slides with 10 μl of Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Background staining was determined by preparing identical coverslips without primary antibody. Images of fixed cells were captured using Openlab software with a Nikon Microphot-SA epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon Plan Apo ×60/1.4 oil immersion objective; filter sets for fluorescein isothiocyanate, Texas Red, and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorophores; and a Hamamatsu Orca C4742-95 digital camera. Raw data images were converted to 8-bit tiff images in Openlab and further processes using Adobe Photoshop Version 5.5. Human phosphatase Inh2 was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, and five distinct positives from 3 × 106 clones in a mouse embryo library were retrieved. Among the clones were fragments of the known proteins Nek2 and spinophilin/neurabin II. Fig.1 A shows a schematic of the Nek2 structure with an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The fragments of Nek2 recovered in the screen are shown asbars, and we note they both lie within the CTD and contain the coiled-coil domain (residues 306–330) plus the PP1C-binding motif, KVHF (residues 383–386). Other epitope-tagged full-length and CTD proteins that were used in this study, both wild-type and Ala-substituted, are shown in Fig. 1 A. A yeast conjugation assay was employed to assess interactions between various forms of Inh2, the Nek2 CTD, and PP1C (Fig. 1 B). Transformation and mating of various yeast MATα andMATa strains were verified on a control double drop-out plate, on which all formed colonies (right panel). On triple drop-out medium, colonies could form only if the specific pair of fusion proteins interacted. Each row is a different protein fused to a DNA-binding domain, and each column is a protein fused to the VP16 transcription activation domain. The entire first row and first column (left panel) showed no growth, as expected for the negative control, which was the PP2A α4 subunit and which did not dimerize or interact with any of the other proteins. In the second row, wild-type Inh2 interacted with the wild-type Nek2 CTD, as expected from the screen, and interacted also with PP1C. The Nek2 CTD (second column) interacted strongly with PP1C, consistent with a previous report (6Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, in this assay, the Nek2 CTD interacted with both Inh2 and PP1C. However, if Val383 and Phe386 were substituted with Ala in the VXF motif to give Nek2 CTD(AA), interactions with both PP1C and Inh2 were lost entirely (third column). Likewise, there was no interaction of Nek2 CTD(AA) with any of the other forms of Inh2. Eliminating PP1C association with the VXF motif also completely prevented Inh2 interaction with the Nek2 CTD. The results suggest that Inh2 associated with PP1C, which at the same time was bound to Nek2. We imagine that the yeast version of PP1C, called Glc7, bridged the interaction of Inh2 with the targets recovered in the two-hybrid screen. Different domains of Inh2 were required for interactions with different partners. With PP1C (Fig. 1 B, left panel,fifth column), wild-type Inh2 and Inh2-(1–118), lacking 40% of the protein, interacted equally well, whereas Inh2-(14–197), without the 10IKGI13 sequence for PP1C recognition at the N terminus, interacted weakly. On the other hand, with the Nek2 CTD (second column), wild-type Inh2 interacted strongly, and Inh2-(14–197) interacted weakly, but Inh2-(1–118) did not interact, showing that the C-terminal region of Inh2 is required for this association. We compared the Nek2 CTD with another PP1 regulatory subunit, the N-terminal domain of the muscle glycogen-targeting subunit GM. There was only weak interaction with PP1C and no interactions with any of the forms of Inh2 in this assay. Our conclusions are that Inh2 interaction with the Nek2 CTD requires binding of PP1C and the C-terminal domain of the Inh2. Thus, the Inh2-PP1C interaction is different with monomeric PP1C compared with PP1C bound to the Nek2 CTD or with PP1C bound to GM. We used recombinant GST fusion proteins in pull-down assays to show interactions of the Nek2 CTD with Inh2 and PP1C. The Nek2 CTD and double Ala-substituted Nek2 CTD(AA) were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins attached to glutathione-agarose beads and mixed with a rabbit lung extract as a source of native PP1C and endogenous Inh2. Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig.2 A,upper and middle panels). PP1C bound to GST-Nek2 CTD, but not to GST-Nek2 CTD(AA) (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). Inh2 binding exactly followed PP1C binding (Fig.2 A, middle panel). Substitution of only 2 residues in a motif known to interact directly with PP1C completely eliminated binding of Inh2. Equivalent amounts of the GST fusion proteins and GST itself as a negative control were bound to the beads and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). We interpret these results as further evidence for formation of a Nek2 CTD·PP1C·Inh2 trimeric complex, with PP1C acting as a bridge between Nek2 and Inh2. Association of Inh2 with full-length Nek2 was tested by transient transfection and affinity purification. Full-length Nek2 with an N-terminal triple-tandem hemagglutinin epitope tag was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The wild-type and Ala-substituted versions of Nek2 (Fig. 1 A) were expressed at similar levels. Samples of these cell extracts and a control extract from untransfected cells were subjected to anti-HA immunoblotting to show the relative expression levels of HA3-Nek2 proteins (Fig. 2 B,upper panel). Human recombinant Inh2 was produced in bacteria as a His6S fusion protein and purified to homogeneity. This His6S-Inh2 protein was bound to S-proteinTM-agarose and distributed into three parallel columns for affinity chromatography with the different cell extracts. The bound proteins from each column were eluted and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). The HA3-tagged wild-type Nek2 protein bound to Inh2, but Ala-substituted HA3-Nek2 did not. Only Nek2 with an intact VXF motif for interaction with PP1C could bind to Inh2. Fig. 2 C shows the indirect interaction of His6S-Inh2 with GST-Nek2 Inh2-binding fragment (IBF). His6S-Inh2 (0.1 μm) was mixed with GST-Nek2 IBF on glutathione-agarose beads. Bound His6S-Inh2 was analyzed by Western blotting. GST-α4 was used as a negative control. His6S-Inh2 failed to associate with GST-Nek2 IBF, whereas the GST-Nek2 IBF·PP1C complex prepared by preincubation with a lung extract coprecipitated with His6S-Inh2 (Fig. 2 C). The results of binding assays and the yeast conjugation assay indicate that Inh2 is capable of interaction with PP1C on Nek2. Nek2 is known to be localized at centrosomes, and the association of Inh2 with Nek2 predicts that Inh2 should appear at centrosomes in living cells. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that endogenous Inh2 was concentrated into a cloud in the perinuclear region in COS-7 cells that were fixed under conditions to preserve microtubules (Fig.3 A). Centrosomes were embedded within this cloud of Inh2 and were located by staining with anti-γ-tubulin antibody (inset, yellow arrow). The cloud of Inh2 was centered at the microtubule-organizing center and depended on microtubule organization. Treatment of COS-7 cells briefly with nocodazole to disrupt microtubules dispersed the cloud of endogenous Inh2 and the fibrillar staining for β-tubulin (Fig.3 B, panels c and d). Longer exposure to nocodazole made the Inh2 staining even more diffuse (data not shown). On the other hand, stabilizing microtubules by adding Taxol to the cells enlarged the zone of bright staining for Inh2; and upon closer inspection, the Inh2 staining appeared in part to overlap microtubules emanating from the centrosome (Fig. 3 B,panels a and b). Association of Inh2 with centrosomes was more evident in ARPE19 cells that did not have a cloud of Inh2 (Fig. 3, C and D). Instead, staining of Inh2 was concentrated into discrete foci near the nucleus (Fig.3 C), which exactly colocalized with γ-tubulin as a marker for the location of the centrosomes in double-stained cells (data not shown). These results show that endogenous Inh2 was localized at centrosomes and, in some cells, was concentrated into a cloud surrounding the centrosomes by a microtubule-dependent mechanism. We assayed the effects of added Inh2 on the kinase activity of a Nek2·PP1C complex. In this complex, PP1C suppressed kinase activity by dephosphorylation and inactivation of Nek2. The HA3-Nek2·PP1C complex was prepared by transient transfection and anti-HA immunoprecipitation from COS-7 cells. Nek2 kinase activity was assayed by incorporation of32P from [γ-32P]ATP into the exogenous substrate MBP. Addition of His6S-tagged recombinant Inh2 produced a dose-dependent activation, with EC50∼ 10 nm (Fig. 4). The maximum activity given by addition of 1 μmHis6S-Inh2 was the same as the activity induced by addition of 1 μm microcystin LR, a potent PP1/PP2A inhibitor (data not shown), suggesting the full activation of the HA3-Nek2·PP1C complex induced by Inh2. This effect is consistent with the high affinity binding of His6S-Inh2 to PP1C complexed to HA3-Nek2. We propose that inhibition of PP1C by Inh2 resulted in higher specific activity of Nek2. The anti-HA immunocomplex might be a mixture of HA3-Nek2·PP1C plus HA3-Nek2 unbound to PP1C; therefore, basal activity without His6S-Inh2 is due to free HA3-Nek2. We tested for binding and activation of Nek2·PP1C complexes with 1) Inh2 (residues 1–198), essentially the full-length wild-type protein; 2) C-terminally truncated Inh2-(1–118), which lacks two sites for interaction with PP1C (17Yang J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); and 3) N-terminally truncated Inh2-(14–197), which lacks the IKGI motif (residues 10–13) required for binding to monomeric PP1C (15Huang H.-b. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shih S.-R. Tsay H.-J., Li, H.-C. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7870-7878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These His6S-Inh2 proteins were produced in bacteria, purified to homogeneity, and immobilized on S-proteinTM-agarose for affinity chromatography. An extract of COS-7 cells expressing HA3-Nek2 was split and subjected to affinity chromatography using parallel columns of the different recombinant Inh2 proteins. As shown in Fig.5 A, all three forms of His6S-Inh2 bound both HA3-Nek2 and PP1C from extracts, but the relative recovery of these proteins was quite different. The His6S-tagged wild-type Inh2 protein bound a substantial amount of PP1C relative to its abundance in the extract. By comparison, the His6S-tagged wild-type Inh2 protein bound a much smaller fraction of total HA3-Nek2 from the extract. This hinted that of all the endogenous PP1C that could bind to immobilized Inh2, only a minor pool was associated with HA3-Nek2. Deletion of the IKGI sequence severely reduced binding of PP1C to His6S-Inh2-(14–197) to levels that were barely detectable, as expected. Likewise, only low levels of HA3-Nek2 bound to His6S-Inh2-(14–197), consistent with PP1C participating in the interaction. Compared with these results, we were surprised by the robust recovery of HA3-Nek2 by immobilized His6S-Inh2-(1–118), which yielded much more than even wild-type Inh2. The level of PP1C recovered was lower than with wild-type Inh2, making the ratio of HA3-Nek2 to PP1C very high. This suggests that His6S-Inh2-(1–118) preferentially bound to HA3-Nek2·PP1C complexes compared with either wild-type Inh2 or Inh2-(14–197). We assayed activation of Nek2 kinase in HA3-Nek2·PP1C complexes recovered by immunoprecipitation in response to addition of the different His6S-Inh2 proteins used for affinity purification (Fig. 5 B). Addition of 100 nm His6S-Inh2 in these assays gave a >2-fold increase in Nek2 kinase activity (n = 3;p < 0.001), measured by phosphorylation of MBP as substrate. T"

The α-l-arabinofuranosidase fromGeobacillus stearothermophilus T-6, a family 51 glycoside hydrolase, was subjected to a detailed mechanistic study. Aryl-α-l-arabinofuranosides with various leaving groups were synthesized and used to verify the catalytic mechanism and catalytic residues of the enzyme. The steady-state constants and the resulting Brønsted plots for the E175A mutant are consistent with the role of Glu-175 as the acid-base catalytic residue. The proposed nucleophile residue, Glu-294, was replaced to Ala by a double-base pairs substitution. The resulting E294A mutant, with 4-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside as the substrate, exhibited eight orders of magnitude lower activity and a 10-fold higherK m value compared with the wild type enzyme. Sodium azide accelerated by more than 40-fold the rate of the hydrolysis of 2′,4′,6′-trichlorophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside by the E294A mutant.

These enzymes are part of an array of glycoside hydrolases responsible for the degradation of hemicelluloses such as arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan, and l-arabinan (1Sunna A. Antranikian G. Crit. Rev.

Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 211-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thel-arabinofuranoside substitutions on xylans can strongly inhibit the action of endoxylanases and β-xylosidases, thus preventing the complete degradation of the polymer to its basic xylose units (4Biely P.

In many cases, microorganisms that utilize hemicelluloses possess α-l-arabinofuranosidases with various substrate specificities and biochemical properties (6Saha B.C. Biotechnol. Adv. 2000; 18: 403-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To date, there are more than 110 sequences of different α-l-arabinofuranosidases, which are classified, based on sequence homology, into four glycoside hydrolase families (GHs) 1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase family; AbfA T-6, Geobacillus stearothermophilusT-6 α-l-arabinofuranosidase; 2, 5-DNPAF, 2′,5′-dinitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside; 3, 4-DNPAF, 3′,4′-dinitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside; 4-NPAF, 4-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside; 3-NPAF, 3-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside; 2, 4,6-TCPAF, 2′,4′,6′-trichlorophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside; WT, wild type; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; CIMS, chemical ionization mass spectrometry : GH43, GH51, GH54, and GH62 (7Henrissat B.

Hemicellulases, together with cellulases, have a key role in the carbon cycle in nature, because they are responsible for the complete degradation of the plant biomass to soluble saccharides. These in turn can be used as carbon or energy sources for microorganisms and higher animals. Hemicellulases have attracted much attention in recent years because of their potential industrial use in biobleaching of paper pulp, bioconversion of lignocellulose material to fermentative products, improvement of animal feedstock digestibility, and organic synthesis (6Saha B.C. Biotechnol. Adv. 2000; 18: 403-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 9Wong K.K.Y. Sanddler J.N. Coughlan M.P. Hazlewood G.P. Hemicellulose and Hemicellulases.

Wang Q. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5583-5584Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The glycosidic bond is one of the most stable bonds in nature, with a half-life of over 5 million years (12Wolfenden R., Lu, X. Young G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6814-6815Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Glycoside hydrolases can accelerate the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond by more than 1017-fold, making them one of the most efficient catalysts known. The hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds occurs via two major mechanisms, giving rise to either an overall retention or an inversion of the anomeric configuration. In both mechanisms, the hydrolysis usually requires two carboxylic acids, which are conserved within each GH family, and proceeds through an oxocarbenium ion-like transition state. Inverting glycoside hydrolases uses a single displacement mechanism, in which one carboxylate acts as a general base catalyst, deprotonating the nucleophilic water molecule that attacks the sugar anomeric center from the opposite side of the glycosidic bond, while the other carboxylic acid acts as a general acid catalyst by protonating the leaving aglycone. Retaining glycoside hydrolases cleave the glycosidic bond using a two-step double-displacement mechanism, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In the first step of the reaction (glycosylation), the acid-base residue acts as a general acid, protonating the glycosidic oxygen and stabilizing the leaving group. The nucleophilic residue attacks the anomeric carbon of the scissile bond, forming a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate with the opposite anomeric configuration of the substrate. In the second step (deglycosylation), the acid-base residue, acting this time as a general base, activates a water molecule that attacks the anomeric center of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate from the same direction of the original bond, liberating the free sugar with an overall retention of the anomeric configuration (13Davies G. Sinnott M.L. Withers S.G. Sinnott M.L. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 1. Academic Press Limited, London1998: 119-209Google Scholar, 14Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Both catalytic mechanisms are found in the different α-l-arabinofuranosidases families: GH51 and GH54 were shown to cleave the glycosidic bond with a retention of the anomeric configuration (15Pitson S.M. Voragen A.G. Beldman G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); GH43, which includes α-l-arabinofuranosidases as well as β-d-xylosidases, was shown to work via the inverting mechanism (15Pitson S.M. Voragen A.G. Beldman G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas the stereochemistry of GH62 is not yet characterized. Currently there are 32 sequences of α-l-arabinofuranosidases classified as GH51 glycoside hydrolases, 2P. M. Coutinho and B. Henrissat (1999) Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes server, available at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼cazy/CAZY/index.html. and, although much work was done on the substrate specificities of these enzymes, there are only a few studies concerning the biochemical mechanism and catalytic properties of this family (17Debeche T. Bliard C. Debeire P. O'Donohue M.J. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Beylot M.H. McKie V.A. Voragen A.G. Doeswijk-Voragen C.H. Gilbert H.J. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarities, GH51 is part of the GH-A superfamily (20Zverlov V.V. Liebl W. Bachleitner M. Schwarz W.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 337-343PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the active site of the enzymes of this family is located at the C-terminal end of a (β/α)8 fold. Nevertheless, the actual three-dimensional structure of these enzymes has not been determined yet. One of the novel biotechnological applications of glycoside hydrolases is the enzymatic synthesis of oligosaccharides (21Palcic M.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Specifically, high yields of different oligosaccharides were obtained with specially engineered retaining glycoside hydrolases, coinedglycosynthases, in which the nucleophilic residue has been replaced. When using activated glycosyl donors of the opposite anomeric configuration (compared with the normal substrates) together with suitable acceptors, these mutant enzymes can efficiently synthesize oligosaccharides but without hydrolyzing the resulting products. Since first demonstrated by Withers and co-workers on β-glycosidase (11Mackenzie L.F. Wang Q. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5583-5584Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar), this technique was applied successfully to a number of other glycoside hydrolases (22Trincone A. Perugino G. Rossi M. Moracci M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Malet C. Planas A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24Fort S. Boyer V.

The α-l-arabinofuranosidases display several unique features making them attractive candidates for glycosynthesis. These enzymes belong to the few glycoside hydrolase families that are able to hydrolyze a furanosidic substrate; several α-l-arabinofuranosidases can also hydrolyze aryl β-d-xylopyranosides, thus their glycosynthase mutants would probably be able to accept both arabinofuranosidases and xylopyranosides as donors (6Saha B.C. Biotechnol. Adv. 2000; 18: 403-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 19Shallom D. Belakhov V. Solomon D. Gilead-Gropper S. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, such engineered furanosidic-glycosynthases have not been reported yet. In the present study, we describe a detailed kinetic study of the α-l-arabinofuranosidase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6 (AbfA T-6), a GH51 glycoside hydrolase. The use of novel substrates bearing different leaving groups for α-l-arabinofuranosidases allowed extensive kinetic analysis of the wild type enzyme and its acid-base E175A mutant. In addition, the Glu-294 residue was unequivocally identified as the catalytic nucleophile of the enzyme, using the azide rescue approach and identifying the glycosyl-azide product. 4-NPAF was obtained from Sigma, and all other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Aldrich or Sigma. 2,5-DNPAF, 3,4-DNPAF, 3-NPAF, and 2,4,6-TCPAF were synthesized according to published procedure (25Kelly M.A. Sinnott M.L. Widdows D. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 181: 262-266Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The detailed synthetic procedures and the characterization of the substrates will be described elsewhere. 3V. Belakhov, D. Shallom, Y. Shoham, and T. Baasov, manuscript in preparation. TLC analysis was performed using precoated plates (Silica Gel 60 F254, 0.25 mm, Merck), and spots were visualized by charring with a yellow solution containing (NH4)Mo7O24·4H2O (120 g) and (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6(5 g) in 10% H2SO4 (800 ml). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 spectrometer at ambient temperature, and chemical shifts are reported (in ppm) relative to the residual proton peak of CD2HOD (d = 3.3) with CD3OD as the solvent. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 spectrometer at 100.61 MHz, and the chemical shifts are reported (in ppm) relative to the residual solvent signal for CD3OD (d = 49.00). FTIR spectrum was recorded on a Bruker vector 22 spectrometer. The mass spectrum was obtained on a TSQ-70B mass spectrometer (Finnigan Mat) by negative chemical ionization in isobutane. The abfA T-6 gene (GenBankTMaccession number AF159625) from G. stearothermophilus T-6 was cloned in the pET9d vector and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as previously reported (19Shallom D. Belakhov V. Solomon D. Gilead-Gropper S. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic primers for the mutant genes were as follows (the mutated nucleotides are underlined): 5′-CCACCTTTCGTTTGACGCATGGAATGTATGGTACCAC-3′ (E294A, one-base pair substitution); 5′-CCACCTTTCGTTTGACGCCTGGAATGTATGGTACCAC-3′ (E294A, two-base pair substitution); and 5′-CGTGGTGCTTGGGCAACGCGATGGACGGTCCG-3′ (E175A). The mutated genes were sequenced to confirm that only the desired mutations were inserted. The wild type and mutated proteins were overexpressed and purified as previously described (19Shallom D. Belakhov V. Solomon D. Gilead-Gropper S. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters were determined in a continuous assay by monitoring the release of the different phenolates using a Biochrom 4060 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). Reactions were performed at 40 °C in 100 mm citric acid-Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. All substrates were initially dissolved in Me2SO, and the reaction contained Me2SO in final concentration of 10% (V/V). Sodium azide was included in a final concentration of 1 m where indicated. Reactions were initialized by adding 200 μl of appropriately diluted, pre-warmed enzyme solutions, to 400 μl of pre-warmed substrate mixtures. Blank mixtures containing all the reactants except the enzyme were used to correct for spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrates. The molar extinction coefficients determined under the described conditions were as follows: 3′-nitrophenyl, 380 nm, Δε = 0.45 mm−1 cm−1; 4′-nitrophenyl, 420 nm, Δε = 2.60 mm−1 cm−1; 2′,4′,6′-trichlorophenyl, 312 nm, Δε = 3.25 mm−1 cm−1; 3′,4′-dinitrophenyl, 400 nm, Δε = 10.9 mm−1cm−1; and 2′,5′-dinitrophenyl, 440 nm, Δε = 3.14 mm−1 cm−1. Values ofK m, k cat, andK I were determined by non-linear regression analysis using the program GraFit 5.0 (26Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit 5. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK.2001Google Scholar). The activity of glycosyl transfer to methanol by the wild type AbfA T-6 was determined in a reaction mixture containing 2.5 mmethanol, 10 mm 4-NPAF, and 16 μm enzyme, at 50 °C. For TLC analysis (EtOAc:AcOH:2-propanol:H2O, 18:7:5:4), samples were taken at different time points, and the reaction was stopped by addition of Hg2+ (final concentration of 2 mm), which completely inhibits the enzyme (27Gilead S. Shoham Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 170-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For 1H NMR characterization, the enzymatic reaction included wild type AbfA T-6 (0.2 mg, 3.5 nmol), 4-NPAF (20 mg, 61 μmol), and methanol (2.5 M) in a final volume of 5.5 ml. After 10 min at 40 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mm HgCl2 and lyophilized. The resultant solid was extracted with methanol and purified by preparative TLC (MeOH:CHCl3, 1:4) on silica gel plates. The enzymatic reaction included E294A mutant enzyme (13.5 mg, 0.24 μmol), 2,4,6-TCNPAF (20 mg, 61 μmol), and sodium azide (1 m) in a final volume of 10 ml of 20 mm citric acid-Na2HPO4buffer, pH 6.0. The mixture was incubated at 40 °C, and the reaction progress was monitored continuously in a spectrophotometer (the release of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol at 312 nm) and by TLC analysis (EtOAc:AcOH:2-propanol:H2O, 18:7:5:4). After complete hydrolysis of the substrate (∼72 h), the mixture was lyophilized, and the resultant solid was extracted with methanol (5 × 5 ml). The extracts were combined and evaporated to dryness. The crude material was purified by flash chromatography (MeOH:CHCl3, 1:9) on a silica gel column to yield the pure product as a white solid (4 mg).1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD): δ 3.55 (dd, 1H,J = 6.4, 11.9 Hz, H-5′), 3.65 (dd, 1H,J = 3.7, 11.8 Hz, H-5), 3.72 (dt, 1H, J= 3.7, 6.1 Hz, H-4), 3.84 (t, 1H, J = 6.1 Hz, H-3), 3.97 (dd, 1H, J = 4.8, 6.4 Hz, H-2), 5.11 (d, 1H,J = 4.8 Hz, H-1); 13C NMR (50.3 MHz, CD3OD): δ 64.1, 76.4, 79.1, 85.5, 92.9 (C-1); negative CIMS m/z 174.0 (M-H−, C5H9O4N3 requires 175.1); FTIR (MeOH) ν 2120 cm−1 (N3). One of the basic mechanistic questions concerning glycoside hydrolases regards the catalytic mechanism of the reaction: is it a double displacement substitution (retaining enzymes) or a single displacement substitution (inverting enzymes)? Usually, this question is addressed by1H NMR analysis of the reaction course (14Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1492) Google Scholar, 28Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Poulter C.D. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 5. Elsevier, New York1999: 279-314Google Scholar). Although this technique was used to determine the stereochemical mechanism of many glycoside hydrolase families, it is limited when the rate of the mutarotation between the α- and β-anomers of the product is rapid and prevents the accumulation of the initial product. In the case of arabinofuranosidases, the arabinofuranoside undergoes fast mutarotation forming the four arabinose tautomers: α- and β-l-arabinofuranosides and α- and β-l-arabinopyranosides. To overcome this kind of experimental limitation, the stereochemical courses of the α-l-arabinofuranosidases from GH51 and GH54 were determined by monitoring the hydrolysis of 4-NPAF in the presence of 2.5 m methanol with 1H NMR (15Pitson S.M. Voragen A.G. Beldman G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For many retaining glycoside hydrolases, methanol can act as an external nucleophile, replacing the water molecule, and the resulting methyl α-l-arabinofuranoside is stable enough to be characterized by 1H NMR analysis. The ability to transfer glycosyl residues to low molecular weight alcohols is restricted only to retaining glycoside hydrolases. Based on the principle of microscopic reversibility, if an inverting glycoside hydrolase would have such transfer activity, it would then have to be anomerically indiscriminative (14Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Thus, the formation itself of the methyl-glycoside product during the enzymatic reaction in the presence of methanol is a strong indication that the enzyme is retaining. The formation of a methyl-glycoside product can be easily detected by TLC analysis, and we used this technique to confirm that the AbfA T-6 is a retaining glycoside hydrolase. The enzymatic reaction of wild type AbfA T-6 with 4-NPAF in the presence of 2.5 m methanol was monitored by TLC analysis (Fig. 2). After 1 min, a new product (R F = 0.6), which was distinct from arabinofuranoside (R F = 0.33) and 4-NPAF (R F = 0.85), appeared. This product was not formed in the absence of methanol, or in the absence of the enzyme. Therefore, it is most likely to be methyl l-arabinofuranoside formed by the AbfA T-6, indicating that this enzyme operates through a retaining mechanism. To confirm this assignment, the new reaction product was purified and characterized by 1H NMR. The observed multiplicity of the anomeric proton (doublet at 4.74 ppm), and its coupling constant (J 1,2 = 1.6 Hz), is consistent with the product being methyl α-l-arabinofuranoside (15Pitson S.M. Voragen A.G. Beldman G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The concentration of the new product increased during the first 5 min, simultaneously with the disappearance of the substrate. Interestingly, further incubation of the reaction resulted in the hydrolysis of the new product by the enzyme, yielding arabinofuranoside and methanol. The hydrolysis of the methyl α-l-arabinofuranoside product was also observed in the case of arabinofuranosidase A fromAspergillus niger (15Pitson S.M. Voragen A.G. Beldman G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This simple TLC-based approach to determine the stereochemical course of hydrolysis can be easily applied to other glycoside hydrolases with unknown stereochemistry. It should be emphasized, however, that the method is valid only when a methyl-glycoside product is formed. The lack of glycosyl transfer activity or the inability to observe a methyl-glycoside product do not necessarily indicate that the enzyme in question is inverting. To characterize the kinetics and the rate-limiting steps of hydrolysis by the wild type AbfA T-6 and its acid-base E175A mutant, we performed steady-state kinetic analysis with substrates bearing different leaving groups. In a previous work done on AbfA T-6, we took advantage of the observation that the enzyme has low, yet sufficient, activity on aryl-β-d-xylopyranosides to perform preliminary kinetic analysis of the wild type and E175A mutant with several such substrates (19Shallom D. Belakhov V. Solomon D. Gilead-Gropper S. Baasov T. Shoham G. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For this study we prepared several aryl-α-l-arabinofuranosides with pK avalues of the phenol leaving group ranging from 5.15 to 8.39. To reduce the spontaneous hydrolysis of the reactive substrates 3,4-DNPAF and 2,5-DNPAF under the conditions used, all reactions were performed at 40 °C, although the enzyme can function at temperatures of up to 70 °C (27Gilead S. Shoham Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 170-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments, the spontaneous substrate hydrolysis rates were subtracted from the observed rates to obtain the net enzyme-catalyzed velocities. The presence of 10% Me2SO in the reaction mixtures (used for dissolving the substrates) had no influence on the activity of AbfA T-6 (data not shown). The kinetic analysis of the wild type AbfA T-6 with 2,5-DNPAF, 2,4,6-TCPAF, and 4-NPAF and of the E175A mutant with all substrates gave typical Michaelis-Menten curves (data not shown). However, in the case of the wild type enzyme with 3-NPAF and 3,4-DNPAF, the reaction rate decreased at high substrate concentrations (Fig.3), suggesting substrate inhibition occurred. Indeed, the resulting velocity curves could be fitted to Equation 1, which corresponds to an uncompetitive substrate inhibition model. The K I values obtained were 10 and 12 mm for 3-NPAF and 3,4-DNPAF, respectively. v0=kcat[E0][S]KM+[S]+([S]2/KI)(Eq. 1) Uncompetitive substrate inhibition can result from the binding of a second substrate molecule to the binding site, forming an unproductive ternary complex (E·S·S). The two substrates that exhibited this kind of inhibition have in common a nitro substituent at position 3 of the phenol group. This distinct location of the nitro group may promote the observed unproductive binding of the substrates to the active site. In this regard, α-l-arabinofuranosidases are exo-type glycoside hydrolases that cleave terminal non-reducing arabinofuranoside residues from arabinose-containing polysaccharides. It is unlikely that the unproductive binding takes place in the −2 and −1 sub sites (according to the nomenclature described by Davies et al.(29Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar)). On the other hand, GH51 α-l-arabinofuranosidases exhibit wide substrate specificity toward the aglycon moiety. Different α-l-arabinofuranosidases from bacterial, fungal, and plant sources can hydrolyze arabinofuranoside moieties atO-5, O-2, and/or O-3 as a single substituent, as well as from O-2 and O-3 doubly substituted xylans and xylooligomers and arabinans (18Beylot M.H.

Biotechnol. 1997; 47: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These arabinofuranoside residues can be either terminal (i.e.attached to the non-reducing end of the oligosaccharides) or they can be attached to an internal backbone sugar, forming branched oligosaccharides. The fact that branched substrates can bind to the active sites of α-l-arabinofuranosidases indicates that there are several possible ways in which the aryl-α-l-arabinofuranosides can fit within the active site in an unproductive way. Further insight into the binding mechanisms of the different substrates may come from the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis with substrates bearing different leaving groups is one of the major strategies for mechanistic characterization and identification of the catalytic residues of glycoside hydrolases. In retaining glycoside hydrolases, the aglycon group is cleaved during the first step of the reaction, so only the rate of this step (the glycosylation) is influenced by the leaving group ability of the substrate (Fig. 1). Thus, a strong dependence between the pK a of the phenol leaving group and the activity of the enzyme (k cat) indicates that the first step is rate-limiting. The k cat/K mvalues reflect the first irreversible step, and, therefore, for retaining glycoside hydrolases the dependence of these values on the pK a of the phenol leaving group provides information about the glycosylation step (28Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Poulter C.D. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 5. Elsevier, New York1999: 279-314Google Scholar, 35Ly H.D. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev.

To date, this kind of detailed kinetic analysis with α-l-arabinofuranosidases was applied only for the enzyme from Monilinia fructigena(36Kelly M.A. Sinnott M.L. Herrchen M. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because the amino acid sequence of this enzyme (and hence its GH classification) is not known, the results of that study could not be extended to other α-l-arabinofuranosidases.

https://openalex.org/W1974069792,"The DNA-binding activity of the eukaryotic transcription factor Ets-1 (E26 avian erythroblastosis virus oncogene-E twenty-six) is negatively regulated by inhibitory regions that flank the ETS domain. Based on the results of solution studies, these N- and C-terminal inhibitory regions have been proposed to pack against the ETS domain and form an autoinhibitory module whose N terminus partially unfolds upon binding of Ets-1 to DNA. Mutations that disrupt autoinhibition of DNA binding also cause a structural change in the inhibitory region. We report here a crystallographic study of fragments of Ets-1 that provide structural details of the inhibitory module and the structural transition that accompanies DNA binding. The structures of free and DNA-bound Ets-1 fragments containing the ETS domain and the inhibitory regions confirm that the N-terminal inhibitory region contains two alpha-helices one of which unfolds upon Ets-1 binding to DNA. The observations from the crystal structure, coupled with mutagenesis experiments, allow us to propose a model for the inhibited form of Ets-1 and lend insight into the flexible interaction between Ets-1 and the acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein, AML1 (RUNX1)."
https://openalex.org/W2141299792,"Prevention of restenosis after coronary intervention is a major clinical challenge, which highlights the need of new therapeutic options. Vascular injury may involve inflammatory responses that accelerate the recruitment and activation of monocytes through the activation of chemotactic factors, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). However, there is no definitive evidence supporting the role of MCP-1 in restenosis. We recently devised a new strategy for anti-MCP-1 gene therapy by transfecting an N-terminal deletion mutant of the MCP-1 gene into skeletal muscles. We demonstrate here that this strategy suppressed monocyte infiltration/activation in the injured site and markedly inhibited restenotic changes (neointimal hyperplasia) after balloon injury of the carotid artery in rats and monkeys. This strategy also suppressed the local production of MCP-1 and inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, monocyte infiltration and activation mediated by MCP-1 are essential in the development of restenotic changes after balloon injury. This strategy may be a useful form of gene therapy against human restenosis."

Ligation of CD95 receptor activates a complex signaling network that appears to implicate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study investigated the place of ROS production in CD95-mediated apoptosis and the role of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1). Anti-CD95 antibodies triggered an early generation of ROS in human breast cancer T47D cells that was blocked by overexpression of GPx1 and inhibition of initiator caspase activation. Enforced expression of GPx1 also resulted in inhibition of CD95-induced effector caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic cell death. Resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis was not due to an increased expression of anti-apoptotic molecules and could be reversed by glutathione-depleting agents. In addition, whereas the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL prevented CD95-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, it did not inhibit the early ROS production. Moreover, Bcl-xL but not GPx1 overexpression could suppress the staurosporine-induced late generation of ROS and subsequent cell death. Altogether, these findings suggest that GPx1 functions upstream of the mitochondrial events to inhibit the early ROS production and apoptosis induced by CD95 ligation. Finally, transgenic mice overexpressing GPx1 were partially protected from the lethal effect of anti-CD95, underlying the importance of peroxide formation (and GPx1) in CD95-triggered apoptosis.

Upon binding of CD95L or agonistic anti-CD95 antibodies, an adapter molecule, called FADD, is instantly recruited to the so-called Death Domain of CD95.

Conversely, oxidative stress has also been shown to promote CD95 or CD95L expression in different cell types. Indeed, addition of pro-oxidants such as H2O2 (18Bauer M.K. Vogt M. Los M. Siegel J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have been reported to be potent inducers of CD95 and/or CD95L. Further support that oxidative stress and CD95 are intimately associated in apoptosis came from the observation that intracellular GSH levels modulate CD95-induced cell death. Depletion of GSH levels in Jurkat cells through overexpression of transaldolase rendered these cells highly susceptible to anti-CD95 antibodies (10Banki K. Hutter E. Colombo E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32994-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, CD95-resistant variants of T-leukemia cells exhibit higher GSH content than original cells (17Kohno T. Yamada Y. Hata T. Mori H. Yamamura M. Tomonaga M. Urata Y. Goto S. Kondo T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4722-4728PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chiba T. Takahashi S. Sato N. Ishii S. Kikuchi K. Eur. J.

Takahashi S. Sato N. Ishii S. Kikuchi K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1164-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Similarly, increasing the GSH concentration in activated human peripheral T-cells resulted in total protection against CD95-induced apoptosis (22Deas O. Dumont C. Mollereau B. Metivier D. Pasquier C. Bernard-Pomier G. Hirsch F. Charpentier B. Senik A. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, CD95 ligation has been shown to decrease intracellular GSH content in Jurkat T-lymphocytes by stimulating the efflux of GSH (23van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15420-15427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, acute GSH depletion has also been reported to prevent CD95-induced apoptosis in some instances (see Ref. 24Hentze H. Schmitz I. Latta M. Krueger A. Krammer P.H. Wendel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5588-5595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and references therein), whereas chronic depletion enhances apoptosis (25Haouzi D. Lekehal M. Tinel M.

Thus, how GSH is connected with CD95-induced cell death signaling pathways still remains to be clarified. The relationship between oxidative stress, GSH levels, and CD95-induced apoptosis prompted us to examine the role of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), one of the major enzymes responsible for ROS detoxification in mammalian cells, in CD95 apoptotic signaling. Four forms of human GPx have been described, including the classical cytosolic/mitochondrial selenium-dependent GPx1, the gastrointestinal GPx2, the plasma enzyme GPx3, and the phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx4 (26Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Nomura and co-workers (27Nomura K. Imai H. Koumura T. Arai M. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29294-29302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) have reported that the latter GPx could suppress apoptosis induced by several stresses including etoposide and UV irradiation through the inhibition of cytochrome crelease and caspase-3 activation. Regarding GPx1, we recently reported that overexpression of this GPx can abolish doxorubicin-induced sphingolipid signaling, a phenomenon accompanied by inhibition of ROS formation and partial protection against doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (28Gouazé V. Mirault M.E. Carpentier S. Salvayre R. Levade T. Andrieu-Abadie N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 488-496PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the yet undetermined role of GPx1 in CD95-induced cell death, we used human breast carcinoma T47D cells, which were stably transfected with a cDNA encoding human GPx1 (29Mirault M.E. Tremblay A. Beaudoin N. Tremblay M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20752-20760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, breast cancer cell lines are known to resist CD95-mediated apoptosis, but T47D cells may represent an exception inasmuch as they express high levels of CD95 (30Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Lowrey G.A. Russell E.K. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4791-4798PubMed Google Scholar). The susceptibility of GPx1-overexpressing cells to CD95, in terms of toxicity and cell signaling, was compared with that of parental cells, which are characterized by low endogenous GPx activity. Here we show that not only could overexpression of GPx1 strongly inhibit CD95-induced ROS formation, caspase activation, and apoptosis but also partially protect mice from the lethal effect of anti-CD95. These findings suggest that GPx plays a critical role in CD95 signaling by regulating effector caspase activation.

The breast carcinoma MCF-7 sublines, stably transfected to express the CD95 receptor (denoted MCF-7/CD95) or both CD95 and Bcl-xL (denoted MCF-7/CD95/Bcl-xL), were kindly provided by Dr. V. Dixit (Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA). They were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with G418 (200 μg/ml) and hygromycin (150 μg/ml). The wild-type (A3) and caspase-8 mutant (I9–2) Jurkat cells were kindly provided by Dr. J. Blenis (Harvard Medical School, Boston), and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (31Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Cell viability was evaluated by using the tetrazolium-based MTT assay (32Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4357) Google Scholar). Adherent cells were detached by incubation for 10 min with EDTA (5 mm) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD95 antibody (20 μl, Beckman Instruments), washed again, and analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) cytometer. After treatment with anti-CD95, T47D cells were washed twice in PBS, lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 v/v, 20 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and then centrifuged for 20 min at 27,000 × g in order to separate the DNA fragments from the chromatin pellet. The DNA content of pellet (resuspended in 1 ml of 1 mm EDTA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 buffer) and supernatant was determined by the fluorometric DAPI procedure (33Andrieu-Abadie N. Jaffrezou J.P. Hatem S. Laurent G. Levade T. Mercadier J.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). ROS production was assessed using DCFH-DA. This probe is an uncharged cell-permeant molecule, which is cleaved by nonspecific esterases once inside the cell, and releases carboxydichlorofluorescein that is oxidized in the presence of ROS. Exponentially growing cells were labeled with 10 μmDCFH-DA for 30 min at 37 °C before the reaction was stopped. Cells were washed three times with PBS. Cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of distilled water and sonicated at 4 °C. The cell-associated fluorescence was recorded at excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 525 nm, respectively, using a Jobin-Yvon 3D fluorometer. After incubation with anti-CD95, cells were sedimented. Cell pellets were homogenized in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 42 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Reaction mixtures contained 100 μl of cell lysates and 100 μl of 40 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the amount of the released fluorescent product aminomethylcoumarin was determined at 351 and 430 nm for the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Analysis of caspase cleavage was assessed by Western blot using the cell lysates prepared for DEVD cleavage enzyme assay. Samples were loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Caspase-3 and its cleaved fragments were detected by using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (a kind gift of Dr. D. Nicholson, Merck-Frosst, Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada); caspase-7 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Oncogene, France Biochem, Meudon, France); caspase-8 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (a kind gift of Dr. G. Cohen, Leicester, UK) (34Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) and a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Western blot was also used to analyze the expression of Bcl-2 (using a monoclonal antibody, Dako, Trappes, France), Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 (using antibodies from Pharmingen), Bid (using a rabbit antibody kindly provided by Dr. X Wang, Dallas, TX), ERK (using a rabbit polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-ERK (using a monoclonal antibody, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and usurpin/FLIP (using a rabbit polyclonal antibody kindly provided by Dr. D. Nicholson). An anti-β-actin (Sigma) was used as a control for protein loading. Mitochondrial preparations were carried out as described previously (35Cuvillier O. Nava V.E. Murthy S.K. Edsall L.C. Levade T. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell samples were washed once with ice-cold PBS and resuspended with ice-cold buffer A (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) containing 250 mmsucrose. After swelling on ice for 5 min, the cells were homogenized with 15–20 strokes of a Kontes Dounce homogenizer with the B pestle (Kontes Glass Company, Vineland, NJ), and the homogenates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then pelleted at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Resulting pellets containing mitochondria were resuspended in cold buffer A. The resulting supernatants (“cytosolic” extracts) were further cleared at 20,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and then transblotted to nitrocellulose. Monoclonal antibodies used against cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase subunit II were from Pharmingen and Molecular Probes, respectively. Age-matched female GPx6 and GPx13 transgenic mice (36Mirault M.E. Tremblay A. Furling D. Trepanier G. Dugre F. Puymirat J. Pothier F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 738: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and control mice (B6C3F1, obtained from Charles River Laboratories) of 10–16 weeks of age were intraperitoneally injected with 0.36 μg Jo2 antibody (Pharmingen) per g of body weight in a total volume of 200 μl of sterile saline. Mice were checked for mortality every 30 min. For in vitro assays, Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. For animal studies, Kaplan-Meier survival rates were compared using the Logrank test. As CD95-mediated apoptosis has been shown to implicate the production of ROS, we investigated the effect of GPx1 overexpression on cell death induced by an agonistic anti-CD95 antibody. This was examined in cells overexpressing GPx (T47D/GPx) as compared with cells transfected with an empty vector (T47D/H3), which express similar levels of CD95 antigen (Fig. 1 A). As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, the CD95-induced time-dependent cytotoxic effect was considerably reduced in GPx1-expressing cells (after 72 h of exposure to the anti-CD95, the viability of T47D/GPx cells exceeded 80%, whereas that of control cells approximated 50%). The resistance of T47D/GPx cells was further confirmed by examining the rate of DNA fragmentation following 48 h of treatment with anti-CD95. As shown in Fig. 1 C, only a small (1.2 times) increase in DNA fragmentation was observed in the GPx1-overexpressing cells (as compared with a 2.5-fold elevation in control cells). To substantiate the role of the antioxidant enzyme GPx1 in CD95-induced cell death, control experiments were carried out by manipulating the intracellular levels of GSH. Whereas the GSH precursor and ROS scavenger NAC completely protected T47D/H3 cells from CD95-induced cell death, the GSH-depleting agent BSO sensitized both control and GPx1-expressing cells to anti-CD95 (Fig. 1 C). These compounds have been shown previously (28Gouazé V. Mirault M.E. Carpentier S. Salvayre R. Levade T. Andrieu-Abadie N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 488-496PubMed Google Scholar) to increase or decrease, respectively, the GSH levels in T47D cells, suggesting that the observed variations in cell viability are indeed related to GSH levels. The resistance of T47D/GPx1 cells to the lethal effect of anti-CD95 was linked to a protection from apoptosis, as indicated by the suppression of DNA fragmentation in T47D/H3 conferred by the rather non-selective caspase inhibitors ZVAD and DEVD (37Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with these results, activation of effector and initiator caspase processing was found in T47D cells upon CD95 ligation (Fig.2). Caspase activity, as measured by the cleavage of the fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC, increased in T47D/H3 cells within 6 h, peaking at 24 h post-treatment (Fig. 2 A). Only a very moderate, progressive increase (less than 1.5-fold) was noted in GPx1-overexpressing cells. Moreover, Western blot analysis confirmed that executioner caspase-3 (Fig. 2 B) and caspase-7 (not shown) processing was reduced in T47D/GPx cells. Processing of the initiator caspase-8, which was detected as early as 15–30 min (data not shown), appeared essentially unaffected by GPx1 overexpression (Fig. 2 B). Finally, CD95-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria was diminished in GPx1-expressing cells (Fig. 2 C). Because CD95-mediated apoptosis has been described to be accompanied by the production of ROS, we next investigated the effect of GPx1 overexpression on intracellular ROS levels measured in anti-CD95-treated T47D cells. Fig.3 A shows that CD95 ligation induced a rapid increase in ROS (probably mostly peroxide) levels as measured by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence. This phenomenon was detectable within the first 15 min of incubation and peaked around 60 min; no increase in ROS levels was observed at later points,e.g. at 24 h (data not shown). In contrast, anti-CD95 failed to produce any detectable ROS increase in T47D/GPx cells, suggesting that in these cells GPx1 overexpression strongly reduced DCF-detected ROS accumulation. Of interest is the finding that caspase inhibitors suppressed the CD95-induced ROS increase in control cells (Fig. 3 B), indicating a protease-dependent mechanism in ROS generation. To explore further the molecular events that lead to ROS production after CD95 ligation, and because this production was found to be dependent on caspase activation (Fig.3 B), we investigated the role of initiator caspases. To this end, ROS production was monitored in human leukemia Jurkat cells expressing or not expressing caspase-8 (31Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar); the caspase-8 mutant cell line expresses very low levels of caspase-8 (see Fig.4 C) and is resistant to anti-CD95-triggered cell death (data not shown). Although wild-type and caspase-8 mutant Jurkat cells expressed comparable levels of CD95 (Fig.4 A), CD95 ligation was not accompanied by early ROS production in the caspase-8 mutant cell line (Fig. 4 B). In the control cell line, generation of ROS was detectable at 60 min, that is concomitantly to the first measurable cleavage of caspase-8 (Fig.4 C). Caspase-3 processing occurred no earlier than 60 min. These data indicate that CD95-induced ROS production immediately follows activation of the initiator caspase-8. Complementary studies further showed that caspase-8 cleavage precedes ROS generation. Indeed, incubation of Jurkat cells with antioxidants (NAC, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, or butylated hydroxyanisole) did not affect CD95-induced proteolytic processing of caspase-8 (Fig.4 D). Because different proteins, including FLIP/usurpin (38Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Hadano S. Houtzager V.M. Seiden I. Keen S.L. Tawa P. Xanthoudakis S. Nasir J. Martindale D. Koop B.F. Peterson E.P.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 2626-2636PubMed Google Scholar), are known to counteract the proapoptotic action of CD95 ligation, we examined whether the expression level of these proteins was affected by GPx1 overexpression. As shown in Fig.5, similar levels of FLIP/usurpin, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bid, and ERK (either the total or active, phosphorylated forms) were noted in T47D/H3 and T47D/GPx cells, excepted for Bcl-2 that was less expressed in GPx1-overexpressing cells. These data indicate that the resistance of T47D/GPx cells is not due to an increased expression of these proteins. Interestingly, the lower level of Bcl-2 in GPx1-expressing cells is reminiscent of a previous observation reporting a decreased amount of Bcl-xL in murine fibrosarcoma cells overexpressing another antioxidant enzyme, Mn-superoxide dismutase (43Kiningham K.K. Oberley T.D. Lin S. Mattingly C.A. St Clair D.K. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because CD95-mediated apoptosis is known to involve mitochondria, and because expression of members of the Bcl-2 family are able to suppress the mitochondrial events, leading to protection from apoptosis in some cell types (see “Discussion”), we investigated whether overexpression of these proteins could alter the above detected production of ROS. To this end, we employed MCF-7 cells, another cell line derived from a human breast carcinoma, that overexpress CD95 and the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-xL (44Srinivasan A., Li, F. Wong A.

Here we have identified a ubiquitously expressed human RhoA-binding protein, designated Rhophilin-2. Rhophilin-2 shows 40% amino acid similarity to human Rhophilin-1 and contains an N-terminal Rho-binding, a central Bro1-like, and a C-terminal PDZ domain. Glutathione S-transferase-capture experiments revealed that Rhophilin-1 and Rhophilin-2 interacted with both GDP- and GTP-bound RhoA in vitro. Despite the ability of Rhophilin-1 and Rhophilin-2 to interact with RhoA in a nucleotide-independent fashion, Rho-induced serum response element transcriptional activity was not altered by expression of either of these molecules. Although Rhophilin-2-expressing HeLa cells showed a loss of actin stress fibers, Rhophilin-1 expression had no noticeable effect on the actin cytoskeleton. Coexpression of Rhophilin-2 with a constitutively active Rho mutant reversed the disassembly phenotype, in which the coexpressing cells were more spread and less contracted than Rho alone-expressing cells. Expression of various Rhophilin-2 deletion and point mutants containing the N-terminal RhoA-binding domain but lacking other regions suggested that the disassembly of F-actin stress fibers was not simply caused by Rho sequestration. In addition, the Bro1 and PDZ domains of Rhophilin-2 were required for disassembly. RhoA activity assays also revealed that Rhophilin-2-expressing cells showed increased levels of RhoA-GTP suggesting that the Rhophilin-2-induced disassembly of stress fibers was not mediated by decreased RhoA activity. Based on the biochemical and biological activity, Rhophilin-2 may function normally in a Rho pathway to limit stress fiber formation and/or increase the turnover of F-actin structures in the absence of high levels of RhoA activity.

Members of the Rho family of GTPases, including Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Rho regulates the formation of focal complexes and stress fibers (2Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 3Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3806) Google Scholar, 4Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). Rho is also involved in the dynamics of other actin-based structures and processes, including phagocytosis (5Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), the cleavage furrow associated with cytokinesis during mitosis (6Kishi K. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Itoh T. Takai Y. J.

Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its effects on the actin cytoskeleton, Rho also participates in the assembly of focal adhesions following cell-matrix interactions (9Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 10Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J.

Biochemical studies using the Rho-specific inhibitor C3 toxin, demonstrate that Rho signaling is involved in tyrosine kinase phosphorylation of both focal adhesion kinase and paxillin (12Kumagai N. Morii N. Fujisawa K. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rankin S. Morii N. Narumiya S. Rozengurt E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6984-6990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One likely mechanism for focal adhesion assembly involves an early step in which Rho induces stress fiber formation. The Rho-induced stress fibers generate membrane tension that induces the aggregation of integrins, which in turn recruit other components of focal adhesions and promote their tyrosine phosphorylation (15Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). The diversity of Rho-regulated cytoskeletal effects stems from the ability of Rho to interact with a large number of downstream effector proteins (16Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348 (Pt. 2,): 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). The most well studied class of these RhoA effector proteins is the family of Rho-associated kinases (ROCKs) (otherwise known as ROKs or Rho-kinases). ROCKs regulate stress fiber formation (17Leung T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). In cell culture studies, expression of a constitutively active ROCK mutant induces the formation of thick actin fibers and the assembly of focal adhesions (20Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y.

Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The non-kinase Rho effector protein, mDia1, also regulates stress fiber formation, apparently by recruiting, among others, the actin-monomer-binding protein profilin (24Satoh S. Tominaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 16: 16Google Scholar, 25Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Similar to ROCK, expression of constitutively active mutants of mDia1 also induces the formation of actin fibers; however, these actin fibers are thin compared with those induced by ROCK (23Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Coexpression of constitutively active mutants of ROCK and mDia1 induces stress fibers and focal adhesions that closely resemble those caused by constitutively active RhoA (23Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Like ROCK, mDia1 may also function in cytokinesis and can be detected at the cleavage furrow in mitotic Swiss-3T3 cells (26Kato T. Watanabe N. Morishima Y. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 775-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another RhoA effector protein, Citron kinase, also accumulates at the cleavage furrow and participates in the regulation of cytokinesis (27Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Constitutively active Citron mutants block cytokinesis of HeLa cells resulting in multinucleated cells (27Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that multiple Rho effector proteins may be involved in the regulation of stress fibers, focal adhesions, and cytokinesis induced by RhoA. Much of what is known about how the effector proteins in Rho signaling pathways function have relied upon the generation and expression of constitutively active and dominant negative mutants. Biochemical and biological analyses of several Rho effector proteins, including ROCK (20Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K.

Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), demonstrate that they exist in an inactive state unless they are bound to Rho. The inactive state of these effectors is maintained by intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions, which are interrupted by the binding of GTP-bound Rho, thus inducing conformational changes that expose their active domains. Deletion analysis has identified regions within these Rho effectors that are essential for this autoinhibition. For example, deletion of the N-terminal, Rho-binding domain of ROCK (20Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) and C-terminal, Rho-binding domain of Citron (27Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) generates mutants with constitutively active kinase activity. Similarly, deletion of the Rho-binding domain within the N terminus of mDia1 results in constitutive activation of this non-kinase effector resulting in the formation of thin actin stress fibers (23Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain of mDia1 alone in mammalian cells can induce stress fiber formation by activating endogenous mDia1 (28Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These results suggest that disruption of autoinhibitory interactions by the binding of GTP-bound Rho is a common mechanism of regulation of these effector proteins. Here we have identified and characterized a novel human RhoA-binding protein, related to mouse Rhophilin-1 (29Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), which we have named Rhophilin-2. Structurally, Rhophilin-2 contains at least three distinct regions that are homologous to the previously characterized Rho-binding, Bro1, and PDZ (PS.D.-95,Disc-large, ZO-1) domains. Northern analysis revealed that Rhophilin-2 mRNA was expressed in all human tissues examined. Studies in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts showed that expression of Rhophilin-2 or the related molecule, Rhophilin-1, did not alter Rho-induced SRE 1The abbreviations used are: SRE, serum response element; EST, expressed sequence tag; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GEF, guanine exchange factors; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends 1The abbreviations used are: SRE, serum response element; EST, expressed sequence tag; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GEF, guanine exchange factors; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends transcriptional activity. Expression of Rhophilin-2, but not Rhophilin-1 in HeLa cells, caused the loss of stress fibers. This disassembly phenotype induced by Rhophilin-2 was reversed by coexpression with RhoA. Examination of HeLa cells overexpressing various deletion mutants of Rhophilin-2 showed that the Rho-binding, Bro1, and PDZ domains are required for the disassembly of F-actin. RhoA activity assays also revealed that Rhophilin-2-expressing cells showed increased levels of RhoA-GTP suggesting that the Rhophilin-2-induced disassembly of stress fibers was not mediated by decreased RhoA activity. Taken together these results suggest that Rhophilin-2 may act as a scaffold protein that limits stress fiber formation or increases the turnover of F-actin in the absence of high levels of RhoA signaling activity. A human melanocyte cDNA clone encoding a protein with a potential Rho-binding domain was identified by a TBLASTN search of the expressed sequence tag (EST) database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the 13-amino acid Rho-binding domain of PKN1 (ELKLKEGAENLRR) as the query. A 1.7-kb human cDNA clone containing this EST (unique IMAGE Consortium identifier 249775 and GenBankTM entryH85494) was obtained and sequenced using a combination of manual sequencing with Sequenase (United States Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH) and automated fluorescent sequencing using sequence-deduced oligonucleotide primers. Using the entire 1.7-kb nucleotide sequence as query, a more abundant, second set of distinct EST clones was identified by additional database searching. DNA sequencing of one of these clones (unique IMAGE Consortium identifier 724324 and GenBankTM entry AA410792) revealed that it was identical to the first clone except for a C-terminal 534-bp segment. We designated the larger clone Rhophilin-2, because it encodes a protein similar to mouse Rhophilin over its entire coding sequence, whereas the shorter form was designated Rhophilin-2β. Because both Rhophilin-2 isoforms lacked the 5′-end, a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR strategy was employed. The upstream primer (5′-GTTGAACAGGACACTGGCCTTCTC C-3′) and the downstream adaptor primer AP1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG C-3′) were used in the first round of PCR using cDNA from kidney (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The conditions of PCR were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 65 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. A second round of nested PCR used 1/50 of the first round reaction product as a template. The new upstream primer (5′-ACAAAGTCCAGCTGGATG-3′) and second adaptor primer AP2 (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′) were used with a PCR program of 30 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. Positive clones potentially encoding the 5′-end of Rhophilin-2 were identified using restriction enzyme digestion and confirmed through DNA sequencing. The sequence of human Rhophilin-2 and Rhophilin-2β are available from GenBankTMunder accession number AF268032. A multiple tissue Northern blot containing immobilized poly(A+) RNA from several human tissues was obtained from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). A probe common to both isoforms derived from the 3′-end of Rhophilin-2 was linearized and used in a T3 RNA polymerase transcription reaction with [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The resulting high specific activity, antisense riboprobe was hybridized at 65 °C under stringent conditions. Following hybridization, the blot was washed and exposed to x-ray film for 72 h. Rhophilin-1, Rhophilin-2, and Rhophilin-2 mutant proteins were expressed in mammalian cells using the pCAF expression vector (30Pirone D.M. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22650-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) containing the FLAG epitope tag (DYKDADDDK) at the N terminus. Full-length cDNAs encoding human Rhophilin-1 were amplified by PCR with appropriate adapter primers from a corresponding IMAGE cDNA clone (IMAGE Consortium identifier 2155941), subcloned into theBamH1-XhoI sites of pCAF, and also sequenced (GenBankTM accession number AY082588). Similarly, Rhophilin-2 was subcloned into the XbaI-NotI sites of the pCAF vector. Deletions of Rhophilin-2 were generated by PCR and/or by restriction enzyme digestion: Rhophilin-2-Δ1 (missing amino acids 1–122 including the putative Rho-binding domain), pCAF-Rhophilin-2-Δ2 (missing amino acids 588–685), and pCAF-Rhophilin-2-N1 (containing just the N terminus and missing amino acids 158–685) (see Fig. 8). The Rhophilin-2-ΔBro1 mutant contains an in-frame deletion of amino acids 185–302. Rhophilin-2 point mutants in the Rho-binding site (Rhophilin-2-E55A,N56A) and in the PDZ domain (Rhophilin-2-R517A,L525A,G526A) were generated from the epitope-tagged constructs by using two Rhophilin-2 sequence-specific oligonucleotides and the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The integrity of all deletion and point mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Details of how each of the plasmids was constructed are available upon request. GST-capture experiments were performed as described previously (31Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST or GST-RhoA fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on glutathione-agarose resin, and loaded with guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate or GDP. N-terminal epitope-tagged mammalian expression vectors for Rhophilin-1, Rhophilin-2, and Rhophilin-2 mutants were transfected into Cos1 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Forty-eight h later, cell lysates were prepared and used in binding experiments with immobilized GST recombinant proteins. Following washing, bound proteins were eluted and separated using an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. The FLAG-tagged Rhophilin proteins were then detected by incubating with rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase followed by incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) and exposure to x-ray film. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and seeded to a density of 80,000 cells per well into 12-well culture dishes. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with a serum response element luciferase reporter plasmid (Stratagene) containing four SRE sites. SRE-luciferase reporter plasmid (500 ng) was cotransfected with the plasmid for cytomegalovirus-Renillaluciferase (1 ng) and with 500 ng of pCAF parental vector, Rhophilin-1, or Rhophilin-2. In the RhoA-V14 cotransfection experiments, SRE-luciferase reporter plasmid (500 ng) was cotransfected with the plasmid for cytomegalovirus-Renilla luciferase (1 ng) and with 250 ng of pCAF, Rhophilin-1, or Rhophilin-2 and 250 ng of either pcDNA or pcDNA-RhoA-V14. The same total amount of DNA was used in each transfection, which were performed using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h post-transfection the medium was removed and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. After 18 h, designated cells were pulsed for 3 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual LuciferaseTM reporter assay system (Promega) and measured on a LB9501 Berthold luminometer. Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate, and SRE-luciferase activity is shown from two independent experiments. Immunofluorescence of HeLa cells was performed essentially as described previously (30Pirone D.M. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22650-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) except that FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was used. At 24 h post transfection, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to detect the FLAG epitope in Rhophilin-2-transfected cells. Following washes in phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were incubated with secondary antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. F-actin staining in permeabilized cells was performed using Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). Cotransfection experiments were also performed with Myc-tagged RhoA-V14. Confocal microscopy was performed with an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope (Olympus America, Inc., Melville, NY) attached to an Olympus 1 × 70 inverted fluorescent scope equipped with a 60× oil immersion lens. Digitalized images were captured using Fluoview software (Olympus America, Inc.). RhoA activity assays were conducted as described previously (32Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 33Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Cos1 cells were transfected with the appropriate vector using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Twenty-four h post-transfection cells were lysed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000g at 4 °C for 10 min and then incubated immediately with 30 μl (20 μg) of GST-Rhotekin-RBD (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 45 min at 4 °C. A 20-μl aliquot of supernatant was also saved for determination of total RhoA levels in each sample. Following incubation, the beads were spun down and washed three times in wash buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline. Following washing, bound proteins were eluted and separated using a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-RhoA polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at 3 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. RhoA protein were then detected by incubating with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase followed by incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) and exposure to x-ray film. Several well characterized Rho effector proteins contain a short amino acid sequence that enables them to bind directly to GTP-bound Rho (34Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify additional Rho effector proteins, we searched the human EST database for sequences similar to the Rho-binding domain of human PKN1 (29Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 35Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing of the single clone identified in this search (GenBankTM accession number H85494) revealed a 1.6-kb open reading frame. Subsequent searches of the EST database using the DNA sequence of this putative Rho-binding domain as the query identified multiple additional cDNA clones that could encode an alternatively spliced, longer isoform. DNA sequencing of several of these clones confirmed that they all encode a longer isoform, which we have designated Rhophilin-2, because it is highly homologous to mouse Rhophilin, which we now call Rhophilin-1 (29Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The shorter isoform, designated Rhophilin-2β, is identical to Rhophilin-2 except that it is missing a 178-amino acid region in the C-terminal half of the larger form (Fig.1). A GenBankTM database search revealed that both isoforms are encoded in a bacterial artificial chromosome clone (CTC-263F14; GenBankTMaccession number AC011449) that maps to human chromosome 19. Sequence analysis of this bacterial artificial chromosome clone revealed that the 178 amino acids missing from the potential Rhophilin-2β isoform are encoded by five exons (data not shown). Because all of the identified cDNAs for Rhophilin-2 were missing part of the 5′-coding sequences, a 5′-RACE strategy was employed. Using human kidney cDNA as template, an additional 186 bp of sequence were cloned thereby producing full-length coding sequences for both Rhophilin-2 and Rhophilin-2β (data not shown; GenBankTMaccession number AF268032). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that Rhophilin-2 contains 685 amino acids, whereas Rhophilin-2β contains 507 amino acids (Fig. 1). We have also identified a second human Rhophilin cDNA by searching the human EST database with the mouse Rhophilin-1 cDNA (29Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Sequencing (GenBankTM accession number AY082588) suggests that it encodes a human homologue of mouse Rhophilin-1 (29Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), because these proteins show 75% similarity with each other. Comparison between mouse and human Rhophilin-1 with human Rhophilin-2 revealed that they are similar in size and have three domains in common (Fig.2 A). Rhophilin-1 and Rhophilin-2 contain a single Rho-binding motif (Fig. 2 B), which is known to be capable of high affinity direct binding to Rho but not to other GTPases such as Cdc42, Rac, or Ras (34Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Both human Rhophilin proteins also have a central domain of ∼200 amino acids that are significantly similar to one another (Fig. 2 A) and to Bro1 domains in other proteins (data not shown). Although the biological and biochemical functions of Bro1 domains are not known, the first Bro1-containing protein identified, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is linked genetically to a protein kinase C signaling pathway that regulates osmoregulation (36Nickas M.E. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Bro1 domains have been identified subsequently in a variety of other signaling proteins, including a phosphatase (37Cao L. Zhang L. Ruiz-Lozano P. Yang Q. Chien K.R. Graham R.M. Zhou M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2066680166,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, RB, is a negative regulator of the cell cycle that is inactivated in the majority of human tumors. Cell cycle inhibition elicited by RB has been attributed to the attenuation of CDK2 activity. Although ectopic cyclins partially overcome RB-mediated S-phase arrest at the replication fork, DNA replication remains inhibited and cells fail to progress to G2 phase. These data suggest that RB regulates an additional execution point in S phase. We observed that constitutively active RB attenuates the expression of specific dNTP synthetic enzymes: dihydrofolate reductase, ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) subunits R1/R2, and thymidylate synthase (TS). Activation of endogenous RB and related proteins by p16ink4a yielded similar effects on enzyme expression. Conversely, targeted disruption of RB resulted in increased metabolic protein levels (dihydrofolate reductase, TS, RNR-R2) and conferred resistance to the effect of TS or RNR inhibitors that diminish available dNTPs. Analysis of dNTP pools during RB-mediated cell cycle arrest revealed significant depletion, concurrent with the loss of TS and RNR protein. Importantly, the effect of active RB on cell cycle position and available dNTPs was comparable to that observed with specific antimetabolites. Together, these results show that RB-mediated transcriptional repression attenuates available dNTP pools to control S-phase progression. Thus, RB employs both canonical cyclin-dependent kinase/cyclin regulation and metabolic regulation as a means to limit proliferation, underscoring its potency in tumor suppression.

Due to its frequent inactivation in tumors (>60%), it is highly relevant to determine how RB functions to inhibit cellular proliferation and to elucidate its interaction with chemotherapeutic drugs.Biochemically, RB functions as a transcriptional co-repressor that mediates the inhibition of cell cycle progression (1Wang J.Y.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). In addition to binding E2F, RB also interacts with histone deacetylase (HDAC) and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling proteins to establish a repressor complex on the promoters of E2F-regulated genes (3Harbour J.W.

In G0 and early G1, RB is hypophosphorylated and forms transcriptional repressor complexes to inhibit cell cycle progression. However, in response to mitogenic signaling, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/cyclin complexes phosphorylate RB (9Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation disrupts the association of RB with its interacting proteins, thereby alleviating transcriptional repression of E2F-regulated genes and facilitating cell cycle progression (1Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar, 3Harbour J.W. Dean D.C.

Consistent with the role of RB as a repressor of E2F, in disparate settings the expression/activity of cyclin E, cyclin A, and CDK2 have been attenuated during RB-mediated arrest.

Throughout S phase, discrete origins of replication fire, and components of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme are sequentially recruited to these sites (14Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The binding of the sliding clamp protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), to chromatin enables processive DNA synthesis and represents one of the final stages of this assembly (15Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that RB regulates DNA replication, the expression of an active RB allele has been shown to specifically disrupt the association of PCNA with chromatin. Demonstrating the critical nature of CDK2 as a target of RB, PCNA activity was completely restored by the ectopic activation of CDK2 in the presence of active RB (16Sever-Chroneos Z. Angus S.P. Fribourg A.F. Wan H. Todorov I. Knudsen K.E. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4032-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although replication machinery was restored by CDK2 and some DNA synthesis occurred, replication was incomplete. These observations indicate that RB regulates S phase through an additional mechanism independent of CDK2 activity.Here, we define a CDK2-independent pathway through which RB regulates DNA replication by controlling dNTP pools. We show that RB is required to maintain the relative expression of dNTP metabolic enzymes in proliferating cells, as loss of RB results in their deregulated expression and resistance to dNTP pool depletion. Conversely, activated RB completely attenuates enzyme expression, limiting available dNTP pools. The inhibitory effect of RB in this context is analogous to specific antimetabolite chemotherapeutics. Thus, RB impinges on DNA replication not only through canonical CDK/cyclin regulation, but also through the metabolic limitation of DNA precursor molecules.DISCUSSIONRB-mediated cell cycle inhibition occurs in response to antimitogenic signals, DNA damage, and other cellular stresses (1Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar, 3Harbour J.W. Dean D.C.

Cancer Invest. 1997; 15: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cell cycle arrest invoked by RB is thought to occur through the inhibition of CDK2 activity or the modulation of cell cycle regulatory factors (2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar, 12Reed S.I. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 7-23PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). However, RB-mediated arrest can only be partially subverted by the ectopic expression of the CDK2 activators cyclin E and cyclin A (16Sever-Chroneos Z. Angus S.P. Fribourg A.F. Wan H. Todorov I. Knudsen K.E. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4032-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Cyclin overproduction in the presence of active RB restores CDK2 activity and triggers S-phase entry; however, efficient DNA replication is not achieved. Analysis of the replication machinery indicated that PCNA tethering was restored, suggesting that downstream effects on the supply of dNTPs may be limiting. Here, we report that the expression of active RB down-regulates the levels of both RNR subunits and TS. Targeted disruption of RB resulted in deregulation of TS and RNR-R2 protein levels and resistance to antimetabolites that target their enzyme activity. Active RB induced an imbalance of intracellular dNTP pools, concomitant with the inhibition of DNA replication. The effects of RB on cell cycle and dNTP levels were comparable to effects of antimetabolites that target RNR and TS activity. Thus, the RB tumor suppressor pathway regulates DNA replication via CDK2 modulation and the metabolic control of dNTP pools.The function of RB to negatively regulate cellular proliferation is attributed to its transcriptional repression of E2F target genes (3Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). These E2F targets encompass a wide variety of cell cycle regulatory and metabolic enzymes (6Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar, 10DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4684-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). It has been viewed that the down-regulation of cell cycle regulatory machinery is the primary means by which RB limits cell proliferation. Consistent with this, RB has been shown to inhibit the expression of cyclin E, cyclin A, or CDK2 to impede S-phase progression (8Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A., Ma, D. Luo R.X.

This has been demonstrated through the reduction in the amount of target proteins and subsequent attenuation of CDK2-associated kinase activity. Because CDK2 activity is required for DNA synthesis, this represents a mechanism through which RB inhibits cell cycle progression (2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar, 12Reed S.I. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 7-23PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M.

Consistent with this idea, ectopic expression of cyclins E or A can partially overcome the inhibition of DNA replication mediated by active RB alleles (16Sever-Chroneos Z. Angus S.P. Fribourg A.F. Wan H. Todorov I. Knudsen K.E. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4032-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, replication is incomplete; cells accumulate with S-phase DNA content and punctate BrdUrd labeling is observed. Investigation of DNA replication machinery under these conditions indicated that PCNA is still associated with chromatin. PCNA is a component of the processive DNA polymerase holoenzyme and is one of the last regulatory effectors of DNA replication (15Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 16Sever-Chroneos Z. Angus S.P. Fribourg A.F. Wan H. Todorov I. Knudsen K.E. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4032-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the sustained inhibition achieved by PSM-RB in the presence of cyclin E represents a very late step in DNA replication and suggests that a specific action of RB may be to act downstream of the replication machinery to inhibit DNA synthesis. One of the few previously identified mechanisms through which replication is inhibited with PCNA tethered to chromatin is through the depletion of dNTP pools through the use of HU (44Bravo R. Macdonald-Bravo H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).The relative levels of dNTPs and the regulation of their synthesis play a critical role in DNA replication (30Mathews C.K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 45Mathews C.K. Ji J. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As such, expression of dNTP synthetic enzymes is cell cycle-regulated, with enhanced expression in S-phase. Even subtle changes in the levels of dNTPs can have a dramatic effect on DNA replication (45Mathews C.K. Ji J. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, inhibition of RNR activity by 50% using CdA leads to marked inhibition of cell cycle progression (40Griffig J. Koob R. Blakley R.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6923-6928PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, dNTP levels vary within S-phase of the cell cycle (46Leeds J.M. Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3443-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); these variations may be responsible for changes in the rate of DNA replication during S-phase (47Collins J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8570-8577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3S. A. Martomo and C. K. Mathews, manuscript in preparation. Consistent with the idea that the attenuation of dNTP metabolism could be a mechanism through which RB inhibits DNA replication, E2F can modify the transcription of several metabolic enzymes (10DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 11Ishida S. Huang E. Zuzan H. Spang R. Leone G. West M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4684-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 48Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 49Dou Q.P. Zhao S. Levin A.H. Wang J. Helin K. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1306-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been demonstrated that ectopic expression of E2F can stimulate the expression of DHFR, RNR-R1, RNR-R2, TS, and thymidine kinase in quiescent cells (10DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). In fact, recent chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses have detected RB on the DHFR promoter at the G1/S transition (50Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, E2F activity is believed to maintain the relative levels of enzyme mRNA during cell cycle progression. Here, we evaluated whether RB could specifically attenuate the expression of metabolic targets as part of a program to inhibit DNA replication. We find that RB reduces the mRNA levels of dNTP synthetic enzymes, with RNR-R2 being the most strongly repressed and DHFR being weakly repressed. We show that active RB targets the protein levels of RNR-R1, RNR-R2, DHFR and TS to effectively limit their abundance. As may be expected for metabolic enzymes, the kinetics of DHFR attenuation were slow and did not correlate with cell cycle inhibition achieved by active RB. However, the RNR-R2, RNR-R1 and TS enzymes were significantly attenuated, concurrent with cell cycle inhibition. In addition, activation of endogenous pocket proteins by ectopic p16ink4a expression led to the loss of RNR-R2, TS, and DHFR. Thus, the depletion of metabolic enzymes mediated by active RB could participate in the inhibition of DNA replication by virtue of altered dNTP pools.In keeping with the significant role of dNTP metabolism in replication control, a number of therapeutic drugs are utilized that target dNTP synthetic enzymes (28Schweitzer B.I. Dicker A.P. Bertino J.R. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2441-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 29Bertino J.R., Li, W.W. Lin J. Trippett T. Goker E. Schweitzer B. Banerjee D. Mt. Sinai J. Med. 1992; 59: 391-395PubMed Google Scholar, 39Pinedo H.M. Peters G.F. J. Clin. Oncol. 1988; 6: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). These antimetabolites generally function as pseudo-substrates that poison their specific target enzymes, leading to the depletion of dNTPs and subsequent inhibition of DNA replication. One mechanism through which resistance to antimetabolites is achieved is through overexpression of the target enzymes. We found that Rb −/− MEFs significantly overproduced RNR-R2, TS, and DHFR protein. Our data are consistent with prior studies demonstrating that loss of RB leads to deregulation of metabolic enzyme mRNA (38Almasan A. Yin Y. Kelly R.E. Lee E.Y. Bradley A., Li, W. Bertino J.R. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5436-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 51Li W. Fan J. Hochhauser D. Banerjee D. Zielinski Z. Almasan A. Yin Y. Kelly R. Wahl G.M. Bertino J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10436-10440Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Specifically, Almasan et al. showed that mRNA levels of both TS and DHFR were elevated in asynchronously proliferatingRb −/− MEFs compared with wild-type MEFs (38Almasan A. Yin Y. Kelly R.E. Lee E.Y. Bradley A., Li, W. Bertino J.R. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5436-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We observed that Rb −/− cells were resistant to increasing doses of the TS inhibitor 5-FU that are known to block DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the increase in RNR-R2 seen in the absence of RB resulted in resistance to the specific RNR inhibitor, HU. These results complement prior studies demonstrating the resistance of RB-deficient cells to MTX and FdU (38Almasan A. Yin Y. Kelly R.E. Lee E.Y. Bradley A., Li, W. Bertino J.R. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5436-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 51Li W. Fan J. Hochhauser D. Banerjee D. Zielinski Z. Almasan A. Yin Y. Kelly R. Wahl G.M. Bertino J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10436-10440Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, RB regulates the relative expression levels of a coordinate set of dNTP synthetic enzymes, thereby rendering cells resistant to a variety of antimetabolites.Finally, to directly assess the effect of RB on replication precursors, we analyzed dNTP pools. Surprisingly, no prior study has implicated a mammalian signal-transduction cascade involved in cell cycle control to the level of dNTP and inhibition of DNA replication. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, several studies have demonstrated the involvement of SML1, an inhibitor of RNR, in the replicative response to DNA damage (52Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 53Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36679-36683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As would be expected from the dramatic effects on protein expression, we find that dNTP pools are significantly reduced through the action of RB. The changes mediated by RB are comparable in magnitude to the changes elicited by antimetabolites that inhibit key enzymes involved in dNTP metabolism. Importantly, the inhibition of replication observed by the use of these antimetabolites was accompanied by the retention of PCNA on chromatin. Thus, cells arrested by antimetabolites behave in a manner analogous to those inhibited for DNA replication with both PSM-RB and cyclin E.In summary, our findings reveal dual roles for RB in DNA replication control: concurrent regulation of CDK2 activity and metabolic enzyme activity through transcriptional regulation.

Due to its frequent inactivation in tumors (>60%), it is highly relevant to determine how RB functions to inhibit cellular proliferation and to elucidate its interaction with chemotherapeutic drugs. Biochemically, RB functions as a transcriptional co-repressor that mediates the inhibition of cell cycle progression (1Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar, 3Harbour J.W. Dean D.C.

Cancer Invest. 1997; 15: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RB interacts with multiple cellular proteins, including the E2F family of transcriptional regulators (6Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). In addition to binding E2F, RB also interacts with histone deacetylase (HDAC) and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling proteins to establish a repressor complex on the promoters of E2F-regulated genes (3Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 7Strobeck M.W. Knudsen K.E. Fribourg A.F. DeCristofaro M.F. Weissman B.E. Imbalzano A.N. Knudsen E.S. Proc. Natl.

Cell. 2000; 101: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This activity of RB is critical for cell cycle inhibition. In G0 and early G1, RB is hypophosphorylated and forms transcriptional repressor complexes to inhibit cell cycle progression. However, in response to mitogenic signaling, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/cyclin complexes phosphorylate RB (9Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation disrupts the association of RB with its interacting proteins, thereby alleviating transcriptional repression of E2F-regulated genes and facilitating cell cycle progression (1Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar, 3Harbour J.W. Dean D.C.

In fungi, they are predominantly involved in the oxidative metabolism of the carbon and/or nitrogen source used for growth. Characteristically, during cultivation on compounds that require the function of peroxisomal enzymes, the organelles rapidly develop and contain the key enzymes involved in the metabolism of the specific growth substrate. The opposite also occurs. When cells grown at peroxisome-inducing conditions are placed in fresh media in which these functions are no longer required for growth, the organelles are rapidly and selectively degraded by an autophagic process, also termed pexophagy (1Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 2Klionski D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In Hansenula polymorpha, selective degradation of peroxisomes is induced when methanol-grown cells are shifted to fresh glucose- or ethanol-containing media. This process involves three morphologically distinct steps, namely (i) sequestration of the organelle to be degraded from the cytosol by various membranous layers, (ii) the fusion of the outer membranous layer of the sequestered compartment with the vacuolar membrane followed by (iii) the degradation of the organellar components by vacuolar hydrolases (3Veenhuis M. Douma A.C. Harder W. Osumi M. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This process has been designated macropexophagy. In the related species Pichia pastoris, a similar process takes place after a shift of cells from methanol to ethanol. However, when glucose is used to induce pexophagy, an alternative degradation pathway is initiated termed micropexophagy. The hallmark of this process is that clusters of peroxisomes are engulfed by the vacuole (4Tuttle D.L. Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 25-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we observed that the mechanisms of peroxisome biogenesis and selective degradation in H. polymorpha use factors in common. We demonstrated that Pex14p, a crucial component in matrix protein import, is also essential for selective peroxisome degradation in H. polymorpha (5Veenhuis M. Komori M. Salomons F. Hilbrands R.E.

Although the molecular mechanisms of the dual function of Pex14p in the two oppositely directed processes are still unresolved, we showed that the information that controls degradation resides in the N terminus of the protein (6Bellu A.R.

Here, we show that a second peroxin Pex3p, which is essential for peroxisome biogenesis and maintenance (7Baerends R.J.S. Rasmussen S.W. Hilbrands R.E. van der Heide M. Faber K.N. Reuvekamp P.T.

At present, a consensus exists that upon induction of macropexophagy in yeast, the whole organelle is degraded by vacuolar hydrolases. In this paper, we demonstrate that Pex3p escapes this process and is degraded prior to uptake of the organelle by the vacuole. We have interpreted our data in that degradation of Pex3p is an essential early step in selective degradation of individual peroxisomes by macropexophagy.

In general, selective peroxisome degradation in H. polymorpha is monitored by following the level of one of the major matrix enzymes: AO, dihydroxyacetone synthase, or catalase. In a conventional degradation experiment using this organism, the level of AO activity and protein decreases to approximately 10–20% of the original value within the first 4 h after the shift (3Veenhuis M. Douma A.C. Harder W. Osumi M. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 14Kiel J.A.K.W. Rechinger K.B. van der Klei I.J. Salomons F.A. Titorenko V.I. Veenhuis M.

Comparable observations have been made for peroxisomal membrane proteins. However, in the course of our experiments, we noticed that in cells of specificH. polymorpha mutants, which are impaired in selective peroxisome degradation (pdd mutants) (15Titorenko V.I. Keizer I. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3p nevertheless is degraded upon the addition of glucose. An example of this is shown in Fig.1 A. After a shift of methanol-grown pdd2 (15Titorenko V.I. Keizer I. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) cells to glucose-containing medium, AO protein is not degraded as expected. However, in the same cells, the level of Pex3p is drastically reduced within a time interval of 90 min. (Fig. 1 A). To further analyze this phenomenon, we analyzed cells that lacked the membrane protein Pex14p. As shown before, Pex14p is essential for peroxisome biogenesis, and normal peroxisomes are absent in PEX14deletion strains (pex14) (13Komori M. Rasmussen S.W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Baerends R.J.S. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, in H. polymorpha pex14 cells, peroxisome development can be restored by the overproduction of the PTS1 receptor, Pex5p (17Salomons F.A. Kiel J.A.K.W. Faber K.N. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12603-12611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Also, because of the absence of Pex14p, these organelles are no longer susceptible to selective degradation (5Veenhuis M. Komori M. Salomons F. Hilbrands R.E. Hut H. Baerends R.J. Kiel J.A. Van der Klei I.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After a shift of methanol-induced H. polymorpha pex14 cells that overproduce Pex5p (pex14::PAOXPEX5mc) to glucose-containing medium. Pex3p is again rapidly degraded, whereas Pex10p, an integral component of the peroxisomal membrane remained virtually unaffected (Fig. 1 B). Essentially, similar results were obtained using cells producing a truncated form of Pex14p of which the first 64 amino acids are deleted (PEX14-ΔN64), and for that reason, they cannot degrade peroxisomes (Fig.1 C). Therefore, these results are in line with the assumption that the degradation pathway of Pex3p differs from that of other peroxisomal proteins upon the induction of selective peroxisome degradation in H. polymorpha. In previous experiments on WT H. polymorphacells, the phenomenon of an alternative rapid Pex3p degradation pathway was less evident (14Kiel J.A.K.W. Rechinger K.B. van der Klei I.J. Salomons F.A. Titorenko V.I. Veenhuis M. Yeast. 1999; 15: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We reasoned that this might be related to microbody numbers, and thus, to the growth stage of the cells. It is well documented that the cells of H. polymorpha that are in the early exponential growth phase on methanol generally contain a single peroxisome and that the peroxisomal volume fraction may increase over 20-fold during subsequent growth (18Veenhuis M. van Dijken J.P. Pilon S.A. Harder W. Arch. Microbiol. 1978; 117: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In conventional degradation experiments, cells have been used that were in the late exponential growth phase and, thus, had accumulated numerous peroxisomes. Because peroxisomes in H. polymorpha are degraded individually and sequentially, the relative high numbers of peroxisomes in such cells in fact could mask the rapid degradation of Pex3p from the relatively few organelles that are tagged for degradation at a certain stage of macropexophagy. Therefore, we decided to analyze the macropexophagy process in cells that contained only few peroxisomes and compared the data with those obtained in cells from the late exponential growth phase in which they contained numerous peroxisomes. The results are depicted in Fig.2. Upon glucose-induced macropexophagy in cells grown to an optical density of 0.8 (OD663 = 0.8), Pex3p is rapidly degraded relative to AO and Pex14p (Fig.2 A). A similar experiment performed on cells grown toA 663 = 2.0 gave essentially identical results: the kinetics of Pex3p degradation are faster than those of AO and Pex14p (Fig. 2 B). However, in this experiment, Pex3p is still detectable 120 min after the shift to glucose medium, whereas the protein is almost undetectable already within 60 min in case of early exponential cells (OD663 = 0.8). Thus, the proper visualization of relatively rapid Pex3p reduction on Western blots appears to be related to the growth phase of the cells and thus ultimate peroxisome numbers. A possible option for an alternative mode of Pex3p degradation would be degradation by the proteasome in the cytosol. To analyze this, experiments were performed in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. To this purpose, 50 μm MG-132 was added to a batch culture of H. polymorpha in the exponential growth stage on methanol (OD663 = 1.3) prior to the addition of excess glucose to induce macropexophagy. The results (Fig.3 A) unequivocally show that the initial rapid degradation of Pex3p observed in control cultures lacking MG-132 (Fig. 3 B) is prevented. Also, the decrease in Pex14p and AO protein levels was retarded (Fig. 3 A) relative to that in control cultures without proteasome inhibitor (Fig.3 B). Electron microscopical analysis confirmed that peroxisomes were not degraded in the presence of MG-132. In these cells, the peroxisome degradation process appeared to be disturbed at an early stage, namely sequestration. As expected, during normal pexophagy in the absence of MG-132, individual peroxisomes are sequestered from the cytosol by several membrane layers (Fig.4 A). Also, in the presence of MG-132, additional membranes were formed. However, they failed to fully and closely enwrap the organelles (Fig. 4 B). We next analyzed whether the authentic H. polymorpha Pex3p was required to allow macropexophagy to occur. To this end, we analyzed peroxisome degradation in an available H. polymorpha pex3 strain that was functionally complemented by theSaccharomyces cerevisiae PEX3 gene under control of the endogenous H. polymorpha PEX3 promoter,pex3::PPEX3ScPEX3. This strain can normally grow on methanol and displays normal WT properties in peroxisome biogenesis and function (19Kiel J.A.K.W. Keizer-Gunnink I.K. Krause T. Komori M. Veenhuis M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, after a shift of methanol-grown cells of this strain to excess glucose conditions, the level of ScPex3p did not decrease. Moreover, also the level of AO remained unaltered, indicating that peroxisome degradation did not occur (Fig. 5 A). Electron microscopical analysis confirmed that the ScPex3p containing peroxisomes were not degraded in these cells (Fig.6). In WT controls, a significant anti-AO-dependent labeling was found both on peroxisome and vacuole profiles 60 min after the shift of cells to glucose, a phenomenon indicative for vacuolar degradation of peroxisomes. However, in pex3::PPEX3ScPEX3, cells shifted to glucose excess conditions and anti-AO labeling was confined to peroxisomes, whereas vacuoles were invariably devoid of anti-AO labeling (Fig. 6).Figure 6Peroxisome degradation is prevented inH. polymorpha pex3::PPEX3ScPEX3.Immunocytochemical localization of AO protein in methanol-grown cells 60 min after the addition of glucose. In H. polymorphacells in which the HpPEX3 gene has been replaced by theS. cerevisiae PEX3 gene (pex3::PPEX3ScPEX3), anti-AO-dependent labeling is only observed on peroxisomes and is invariably absent on vacuoles, confirming that peroxisomes are not degraded in these cells (A). In WT control cells, AO labeling is observed both on peroxisome and vacuole profiles, indicative for the ongoing peroxisome degradation (B). Ultrathin sections of glutaraldehyde-fixed cells labeled with anti-AO antibodies are shown. The bar represents 0.5 μm.AV, autophagic vacuole; M, mitochondrion;N, nucleus; P, peroxisome.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fusion of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)1 to the extreme C terminus of H. polymorpha Pex3p also strongly interfered with macropexophagy. In a conventional degradation experiment, the levels of HpPex3p-GFP and AO decreased much slower (Fig. 5 B) compared with Pex3p and AO in WT cells. Apparently, the GFP tag interferes with the rapid degradation of Pex3p and the subsequent turnover of the organelle. To test whether Pex3p degradation is a rapid constitutive process and also occurs under conditions where peroxisome degradation is not induced, we tested the effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 on Pex3p levels in cultures that were in the exponential growth phase on methanol. As shown in Fig.7, the addition of MG-132 to such cells did not result in an increase in Pex3p levels relative to controls that lack MG-132. These data indicate that at normal growth conditions, no strong continuous Pex3p turnover occurs. Instead, they strongly support the notion that the decline of Pex3p upon initiation of pexophagy is the result of induced Pex3p degradation rather than a shift in equilibrium of Pex3p synthesis, which is reduced because of the addition of glucose, and continuous degradation. In this paper, we provide evidence that upon the induction of selective degradation of peroxisomes (macropexophagy) inHansenula polymorpha a peroxisomal membrane protein, Pex3p, does not follow the normal degradative pathway of other peroxisomal constituents in the vacuole. Pex3p is one of the first identified peroxisomal membrane proteins and has been observed in various organisms including man (7Baerends R.J.S. Rasmussen S.W. Hilbrands R.E. van der Heide M. Faber K.N.

In H. polymorpha, the protein is essential for peroxisome biogenesis and maintenance (7Baerends R.J.S. Rasmussen S.W. Hilbrands R.E. van der Heide M. Faber K.N. Reuvekamp P.T. Kiel J.A.K.W.

However, in H. polymorpha, Pex3p appears to be associated with the outer surface of the peroxisomal membrane without spanning it (25Haan G.J. Faber K.N. Baerends R.J. Koek A. Krikken A.

Selective turnover of membrane proteins has been observed in various cellular membranes. However, for peroxisomal membranes, this process has not been described before. So far, three mechanisms are known that result in the specific degradation of selected membrane proteins. Proteins of the plasma membrane (e.g. yeast Ste6p) first undergo ubiquitin-mediated internalization (endocytosis). Subsequently, the protein is transported via vesicle trafficking to the vacuole where it is degraded (26Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 27Kranz A. Kinner A. Kolling R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the endoplasmic reticulum, membrane proteins to be degraded are marked with ubiquitin as well but subsequently are dislocated and degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol (28Plemper R.K. Wolf D.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 266-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 29Benharouga M. Haardt M. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A well known example of this process is the degradation of defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (a cAMP-regulated chloride channel), which leads to reduced lung function and, ultimately, death (30Skach W.R. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 825-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A third membrane protein degradation pathway occurs in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts and involves membrane-bound AAA-proteases that remove proteins from the membrane and subsequently degrade them (31Langer T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). So far no peroxisomal membrane-bound proteases have been identified. However, general cellular degradation mechanisms like the ubiquitin/proteasome system may play a role in degradation of peroxisomal membrane proteins as well. In H. polymorpha, peroxisomes are degraded individually, a process that is not inhibited by cycloheximide and apparently does not require protein synthesis. In P. pastoris, an identical process has been observed upon exposure of methanol-grown cells to excess ethanol (4Tuttle D.L. Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 25-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In P. pastoris but not in H. polymorpha, a second mode of pexophagy is also described, namely the glucose-induced bulk turnover of peroxisome clusters. This process designated microautophagy is dependent on protein synthesis (4Tuttle D.L. Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 25-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At present, the first clues of the principles of the macro/micropexophagy machinery in yeast become clear. Taking together the data of S. cerevisiae, H. polymorpha, andP. pastoris, the picture emerges that these processes overlap with other vacuolar sorting pathways, e.g.endocytosis, macroautophagy, and microautophagy and the cytoplasm to vacuole transport pathway (32Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D. Traffic. 2001; 2: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 33Abeliovich H. Klionsky D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 63: 463-479Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 34Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Oshumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). However, the selectivity of macropexophagy in H. polymorpha is apparently organized at the initial stages of the process and most probably is not overlapping with other vacuolar protein sorting pathways (35Bellu A.R. Kram A.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. FEMS Yeast Res. 2001; 1: 23-31PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bellu A.R. Kiel J.A.K.W. Microsc. Res. Technol. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). The selectivity of peroxisome degradation during macropexophagy inH. polymorpha is manifested by the close sequestration of organelles to be degraded by various membrane layers prior to their uptake in the vacuole. Crucial for the understanding of the function of Pex3p removal in this process is information on how and at which stage of the process the protein is degraded. To this purpose, we analyzed two H. polymorpha pdd mutants, namely pdd1, which is known to be affected in the first step of the pexophagy process, organelle sequestration, and pdd2, which shows normal sequestration but is impaired in the vacuole fusion process (15Titorenko V.I. Keizer I. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Upon induction of macropexophagy, the turnover of Pex3p was fully prevented in pdd1 cells (14Kiel J.A.K.W. Rechinger K.B. van der Klei I.J. Salomons F.A. Titorenko V.I. Veenhuis M.

Apparently, Pex3p is not degraded in the vacuole but in the cytosol, a process that may directly or indirectly involve the function of the proteasome, because inhibition of the proteasome activity by MG-132 prevented Pex3p turnover. The removal of Pex3p from the peroxisomal membrane seems to be a prerequisite to allow macropexophagy to proceed and requires the WTH. polymorpha Pex3p. Indicative for this hypothesis are the findings that the replacement of HpPex3p by the bakers' yeast homologue, ScPex3p, did not affect peroxisome biogenesis but inhibited organelle degradation. When GFP was fused to the C terminus of HpPex3p degradation of Pex3p-GFP and peroxisome turnover was significantly retarded. Possibly, correct exposure of specific domains in HpPex3p is important for the removal of the protein, a process that might be disturbed upon fusion of GFP to the C terminus. Together with the observation that initiation of macropexophagy does not require protein synthesis, this finding lends support to the view that probably modification/conformational changes or rearrangement reactions of already existing proteins have to occur to allow initiation of this degradation process. We speculate that the presence of GFP at the extreme C terminus of Pex3p may interfere with recognition of the domain that is involved in the initial stage of macropexophagy and/or blocks conformational changes/modifications of the protein that are necessary to allow its degradation. The importance of Pex3p removal to initiate peroxisome degradation is also in line with our previous observation that in cells in which HpPex3p is overproduced, selective peroxisome degradation is disturbed (37Baerends R.J.S. Salomons F.A. Kiel J.A.K.W. Van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1449-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Four hours after the induction of peroxisome degradation in a HpPex3p-overproducing strain, HpPex3p was still present, whereas in the WT control, HpPex3p was not detectable anymore at that time point (37Baerends R.J.S. Salomons F.A. Kiel J.A.K.W. Van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1449-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These data also indicate that the presence of HpPex3p inhibits peroxisome degradation. Previously, we showed that Pex14p, one of the main docking proteins in the peroxisomal matrix protein import pathway, is essential to allow macropexophagy (5Veenhuis M. Komori M. Salomons F. Hilbrands R.E. Hut H. Baerends R.J. Kiel J.A. Van der Klei I.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The information that governed this process appeared to be located in the extreme N terminus of the protein (6Bellu A.R. Komori M. van der Klei I.J. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44570-44574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The data suggested that Pex14p may act as a kind of molecular switch that discriminated between organelle biogenesis and susceptibility to organelle degradation. Yet, it is unclear whether Pex3p and Pex14p take part in a joint machinery (e.g. in the tagging process of organelles destined for degradation) or serve completely different roles in the degradation process. A clue in the order of Pex14p function and Pex3p removal may be deduced from the experiments in cells that lack Pex14p but in which peroxisome formation was restored by overproduction of the PTS1 receptor, Pex5p (strainpex14::P AOX PEX5 mc). The reintroduction of the organelles allowed us to address the fate of Pex3p upon exposure of the cells to excess glucose. Our data revealed that upon induction of macropexophagy in methanol-inducedpex14::P AOX PEX5 mccells the level of Pex3p decreased with time. Thus, Pex3p is degraded independent from the function of Pex14p in macropexophagy. Essentially, similar experiments were performed with a strain that produced a truncated form of Pex14p that lacked the initial 64 N-terminal amino acids (PEX14-ΔN64) and thus could not degrade peroxisomes (6Bellu A.R. Komori M. van der Klei I.J. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44570-44574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because in cells of the PEX14-ΔN64 strain Pex3p was degraded, we assume that in macropexophagy, the degradation of Pex3p occurs prior to the step that requires (the N terminus of) Pex14p. In conclusion: this work has extended the list of multiple functions of Pex3p in peroxisome development (matrix protein import, membrane biogenesis, maintenance, and stabilization) to a role in peroxisome degradation. The molecular mechanisms of how the protein can serve these various mechanisms is largely unclear and is a topic of current investigations.

We previously demonstrated that upon GlcCer accumulation, cultured hippocampal neurons exhibit modified growth patterns, altered endoplasmic reticulum density, and altered calcium release from intracellular stores. We here examined the relationship between GlcCer accumulation and phospholipid synthesis. After treatment of neurons with an active site-directed inhibitor of glucocerebrosidase, or in neurons obtained from a mouse model of Gaucher disease, [14C]methyl choline incorporation into [14C]phosphatidylcholine ([14C]PC) and [14C]sphingomyelin was elevated, as were [14C]CDP-choline levels, suggesting that CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) is activated. Indeed, CCT activity was elevated in neurons that had accumulated GlcCer. GlcCer, but not galactosylceramide (GalCer), stimulated CCT activity in rat brain homogenates, and significantly higher levels of CCT were membrane associated in cortical homogenates from a mouse model of Gaucher disease compared with wild-type mice. Because CCT mRNA and protein levels were unaltered in either neurons or brain tissue that had accumulated GlcCer, it appeared likely that GlcCer activates CCT by a post-translational mechanism. This was verified by examination of the effect of GlcCer on CCT purified about 1200-fold from rat brain. GlcCer stimulated CCT activity, with stimulation observed at levels as low as 2.5 mol% and with maximal activation reached at 10 mol%. In contrast, GalCer had no effect. Together, these data demonstrate that GlcCer directly activates CCT, which results in elevated PC synthesis, which may account for some of the changes in growth rates observed upon neuronal GlcCer accumulation."

PG composition and structure have been reported to alter with age. To test whether the post-translational modifications to PGs can serve asin vitro surrogate end point markers for chronological age, the extent of GAG modifications was determined for PGs derived from normal human bone cells of 14 donors (age range, fetal to 60 years). Isolated cells were steady state radiolabeled with35SO 42− and [3H]GlcN. For biglycan and decorin, iduronate content was linearly correlated with age (increased 1.5× between fetal and age 60 years). For the syndecan-like heparan sulfate PG, theN-sulfation of post-natal cells increased over 3.5-fold until reaching a plateau during the 4th decade of life. The amount ofO-linked oligosaccharides was also found to decrease as a function of increasing normal donor age, whereas the specific activity of the metabolic precursor pool remained constant regardless of donor age. These age-related changes in post-translational modifications were then used to demonstrate that osteoblasts derived from patients with osteogenesis imperfecta did not exhibit facets of a pre-mature aging, but rather were arrested in a fetal-like phenotypic state. A growth matrix rich in thrombospondin altered PG metabolism in osteoblastic cells, resulting in the production and secretion of the fetal-like (rich inO-linked oligosaccharides) forms of decorin and biglycan. This effect was qualitatively different from the effect of transforming growth factor-β, which predominantly altered GAGs rather thanO-linked oligosaccharides.

Short stature, blue sclerae, laxity of ligaments, non-union of fractures, keloid and hyperplastic callus formation are among frequently encountered symptoms (1McKusick V.A. Birth Defects Orig. Artic. Ser. 1975; 11: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). The original clinical classification of OI defined four types on the basis of phenotypic severity (2Sillence D.O. Rimoin D.L. Lancet. 1978; 1: 1041-1042Abstract PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Sillence D.O. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 543: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The clinical heterogeneity was reflected by a variety of mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes that are thought to be the underlying cause of most cases of OI (4Sykes B. Nature. 1990; 348: 18-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, a new group of patients have been defined in terms of clinical severity and by the exclusion of type I collagen gene mutations (5Glorieux F.H. Rauch F. Plotkin H. Ward L. Travers R.

Mutat. 2001; 17: 434Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The lack of a clear relationship between collagen mutation and phenotype as well as the absence of type I collagen mutations in the recently defined groups has suggested the involvement of other modifying factors.Proteoglycans (PGs) are a family of molecules that possess a core protein to which one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are covalently attached (7Roden L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, PG core proteins may also possessN- and O-linked oligosaccharides. Human bone cells in culture produce a large versican-like PG, a heparan sulfate syndecan-like PG, as well as biglycan (BGN) and decorin (DCN) (8Beresford J.N. Fedarko N.S. Fisher L.W. Midura R.J. Yanagishita M. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17164-17172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Osteoblast cells derived from OI patients were found to have reduced levels of collagen, osteonectin, large chondroitin sulfate PG, BGN, and DCN when compared with levels found in age-matched control bone cell cultures (9Fedarko N.S. Moerike M. Brenner R. Robey P.G. Vetter U. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The failure of OI osteoblast-like cells to parallel the normal donor age-dependent expression pattern of matrix genes was found to occur throughout long term culture (10Fedarko N.S. Sponseller P.D. Shapiro J.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Osteoblast-like cell strains derived from OI patients had significantly reduced growth parameters (11Fedarko N.S. D'Avis P. Frazier C.R. Burrill M.J. Fergusson V. Tayback M. Sponseller P.D. Shapiro J.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The reduction in maximal cell growth rates and levels of extracellular matrix components observed in OI-derived osteoblast-like cells, although abnormally low compared with age-matched controls, are equivalent to values observed in cells derived from elderly donors >60 years of age (12Fedarko N.S. Vetter U.K. Weinstein S. Robey P.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, OI could be exhibiting facets of normal aging and the observed phenotype of osteopenia and brittle bones would then share certain common features with age-related osteoporosis.The fine structure of PGs have been reported to change as a function of donor age in other organ systems (13Sames K. Jolles P. Proteoglycans. 70. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1994: 243-274Google Scholar). The current study was undertaken to determine whether post-translational modifications to PGs can serve as surrogate biochemical markers to define donor chronological age. These markers were then used to evaluate whether the expression pattern observed in bone cells derived from OI patients were consistent with an accelerated aging where the physiological age of the bone is well advanced beyond chronological age. The biological signals associated with these altered post-translational modifications were investigated.DISCUSSIONPG synthesis begins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum whereN-linked oligosaccharides are added co-translationally to the nascent core protein (43Schwartz N.B. Habib G. Campbell S. D'Elvlyn D. Gartner M. Krueger R. Olson C. Philipson L. Fed. Proc. 1985; 44: 369-372PubMed Google Scholar). Once in the Golgi, high mannoseN-linked oligosaccharides are modified, andO-linked oligosaccharides are added. GAG chain addition begins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and proceeds as the core protein traverses the intracellular secretory pathway (44Schwartz N. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D649-D655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These GAG chains define the class of the PG by a general repeating disaccharide backbone. For heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate PGs, the backbone consists of (hexuronic acid-N-acetylhexosamine)n which can have sulfate ester substituents on either the uronic acid or hexosamine or both (7Roden L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). Dermatan sulfate is distinguished from chondroitin sulfate by the epimerization of glucuronate residues to iduronate and by 2-O-sulfation of those iduronate residues. Heparin is distinguished from heparan sulfate by possessing a higher degree of N-sulfated glucosamine residues and moreO-sulfation (of both the uronic acid and glucosamine residues). Dermatan sulfate containing PGs are defined as mature based on their iduronate content, whereas heparan sulfate containing PGs are defined by their extent on N-sulfation of glucosamine residues (37Lindahl U. Haemostasis. 1990; 20: 146-153PubMed Google Scholar, 45Malmstrom A. Fransson L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3419-3425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The distribution and structure of PGs has been found to change with age in a number of different tissues/organs. The ratio of keratan sulfate to chondroitin sulfate chains was found to increase with increasing age in lumbar intervertebral discs (29Adams P. Muir H. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1976; 35: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 30Adams P. Eyre D.R. Muir H. Rheumatol. Rehabil. 1977; 16: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In intervertebral discs and hyaline cartilage, the size range of the PGs exhibited greater polydispersity with increasing age (33Johnstone B. Bayliss M.T. Spine. 1995; 20: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Buckwalter J.A. Rosenberg L.C. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1988; 1: 87-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Buckwalter J.A. Roughley P.J. Rosenberg L.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1994; 28: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The degree ofN-sulfation of cell-associated heparan sulfate increased with age in gingival fibroblasts (31Bartold P.M. Boyd R.R. Page R.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 126: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In skin fibroblasts, the levels of versican were found to decrease and DCN increased with age (36Carrino D.A. Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Older skin also exhibited a greater polydispersity in size. The current study was undertaken to determine whether similar age-related changes occurred in normal bone cell-derived PGs. Changes in the extent of post-translational modifications to both heparan and dermatan sulfate chains of bone PGs were observed in the current study. The correlation of donor age with changes in normal bone cell PG fine structure suggested that these specific alterations might be used as surrogate markers of a physiologic age of the tissue/cells synthesizing the PG. The utility of the PG fine structures as such markers was investigated by studying PGs derived from OI donors.Previous work has shown that the stoichiometry of extracellular matrix components made by OI bone cells was different from that of age-matched controls (9Fedarko N.S. Moerike M. Brenner R. Robey P.G. Vetter U. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Fedarko N.S. Robey P.G. Vetter U.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1122-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to type I collagen, the synthesis of the four bone PGs was reduced in OI cells (9Fedarko N.S. Moerike M. Brenner R. Robey P.G. Vetter U. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The levels of other matrix components, hyaluronan as well as fibronectin and thrombospondin, were elevated in the extracellular matrix pool compared with age-matched controls (17Fedarko N.S. Robey P.G. Vetter U.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1122-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The proliferative capacity and growth rate of OI cells were reduced relative to normal cells (11Fedarko N.S. D'Avis P. Frazier C.R. Burrill M.J. Fergusson V. Tayback M. Sponseller P.D. Shapiro J.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Finally, the observed changes in OI bone matrix stoichiometry persisted in long term culture (10Fedarko N.S. Sponseller P.D. Shapiro J.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reduced levels of matrix expression in osteoblast-like cells derived from young donors with OI (compared with normal age-matched controls) were within the normal range seen for cells derived from healthy donors over the age of 60 years. One possible interpretation of the observed alterations in extracellular matrix stoichiometry was that OI osteoblasts fail to parallel the normal bone cell developmental expression pattern because they exhibit a prematurely aged expression pattern. If this were the case then biochemical markers of this aged state should be identifiable.By using bone PG post-translational modification structure as surrogate markers for physiologic age, cells derived from OI donors are fetal-like in terms of PG distribution, GAG maturity, andO-linked modifications. The pattern of expression and fine structure of the PGs were consistent with OI-derived osteoblasts failing to follow a developmental differentiation pattern. This failure in differentiation may contribute to the pathophysiological consequences observed in the OI phenotype. Although the absolute levels are equivalent to cells derived from aged normal donors, both the distribution among the four PGs and the degree of O-linked oligosaccharide modifications were found to be similar to the fetal-like pattern. Thus the hypothesis that the reduction in extracellular matrix production as well as reduced proliferative rates of OI-derived osteoblast-like cells was a manifestation of advanced aging can be excluded. The observed lack of change in OI cell GAG modification (epimerization and sulfation pattern) was consistent with a failure of cells to progress from the fetal state of expression patterns. There was no clear correlation between severity of disease (OI type) and the type of PG fine structure. The observation of PGs possessing O-linked oligosaccharide structures of a fetal-like nature, which did not change with increasing age of the OI donor, point to a fundamental error in the normal differentiation pathway of osteoblasts as a consequence of a mutation in type I collagen.When normal adult cells were cultured on thrombospondin (but not fibronectin, vitronectin, type I collagen, osteopontin, or bone sialoprotein) the post-translational pattern of small matrix PGs closely resembles the pattern characteristic for osteoblastic cells obtained from OI donors as well as normal fetal donors, even though cells used for these set of experiments were obtained from a 65-year-old donor. Interestingly, both fetal bone cell cultures and cells derived from donors with OI synthesize and secrete significantly higher levels of thrombospondin than cultures obtained from normal adult donors (17Fedarko N.S. Robey P.G. Vetter U.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1122-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It may be that the over-glycosylation of the oligosaccharides observed for OI and fetal cells is a consequence of an “autocrine” effect of thrombospondin, synthesized in higher amounts by these cells. It is also possible that elevated thrombospondin and altered PG post-translational modifications reflect an underlying altered phenotypic expression pattern.The major source of thrombospondin is the α-granules of platelets (46Frazier W.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), from which it is released following platelet activation and degranulation. This mechanism is one of the first steps in the process of wound healing. It is possible that thrombospondin, apart from its involvement in promoting cell attachment via several different mechanisms described (47Asch A. Tepler J. Silbiger S. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1740-1745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also influences cell metabolism to make it more effective in the task of rebuilding damaged matrix. Thus, it is conceivable that under certain conditions (e.g. insufficient collagen and matrix production in OI as well as increased fractures) osteoblastic cells exist in a milieu that is essentially a damaged matrix, and part of the programmed response is expression of an “elevated thrombospondin/altered post-translational structure” phenotype with respect to their matrix metabolic activity.The addition of TGF-β1 to normal adult-derived bone cells did not produce the altered O-linked oligosaccharides associated with OI. OI bone cells do not exhibit a TGF-β-dependent increase in collagen synthesis and alkaline phosphatase activity seen with normal bone cells (48Morike M. Windsheimer E. Brenner R. Nerlich A. Bushart G. Teller W.M. Vetter U.K. J. Orthop. Res. 1993; 11: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). OI osteoblasts had a greater reduction in TGF-β receptor I–III number than age-matched controls, and receptor affinity was unchanged, whereas ligand-induced modulation of receptor number was found to be impaired in the OI cells (49Gebken J. Brenner R. Feydt A. Notbohm H. Brinckmann J. Muller P.K. Batge B. Pathobiology. 2000; 68: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the association of elevated thrombospondin levels with altered post-translational modifications in OI osteoblasts is unlikely to involve TGF-β.Currently, over 250 distinct type I collagen mutations have been identified in OI patients, with point mutations resulting in substitutions for glycine residues being the most common (50Dalgleish R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 51Dalgleish R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although there are a large number (>50) of exons in COL1A1and COL1A2 genes, single exon deletions are a rare finding (52Barsh G.S. Roush C.L. Bonadio J. Byers P.H. Gelinas R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2870-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Some mutations lead to the functional loss of the affected allele, which has been suggested to cause mild (type I) forms of OI (53Rowe D.W. Shapiro J.R. Poirier M. Schlesinger S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mutations in the collagen genes of the severely affected patients are thought to lead both to a reduced type I collagen synthesis, secretion, and deposition of structurally abnormal collagen molecules into the matrix (39Byers P.H. Steiner R.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1992; 43: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 54Prockop D.J. Arthritis & Rheum. 1988; 31: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 55Kobayashi K. Hata R. Nagai S. Niwa J. Hoshino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Histomorphometric studies of human OI types III and IV bone have suggested that OI is associated with a high bone turnover rate (56Jones S.J. Glorieux F.H. Travers R. Boyde A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1999; 64: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 57Rauch F. Travers R. Parfitt A.M. Glorieux F.H. Bone (New York). 2000; 26: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For adult OI type IA and perhaps in children with mild disease, the turnover rate may not be as high (27McCarthy E.F. Earnest K. Rossiter K. Shapiro J. Clin. Orthop. 1997; 336: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,58Kauppila S. Tekay A. Risteli L. Koivisto M. Risteli J. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 28: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The increased turnover is believed to arise from increased osteoclastic activity in the presence of inadequate matrix production by osteoblasts.Based upon our in vitro observations of the effects of type I collagen mutations on osteoblast proliferation, extracellular matrix component expression, and PG fine structure, it is apparent that the mutations that give rise to OI cause pleiotropic effects far beyond the production of a structurally aberrant type I collagen molecule. We hypothesize that although the genotype for most cases of human OI is caused by mutations in type I collagen, the phenotype may be defined by an altered bone matrix stoichiometry and concomitant altered osteoblast differentiation state, i.e. the pathophysiological consequences of mutations in OI arise not solely from structural aberrations in type I collagen but also from alterations in osteoblastic differentiation. Altered osteoblastic differentiation may arise from altered extracellular matrix feedback into cellular metabolism.

Short stature, blue sclerae, laxity of ligaments, non-union of fractures, keloid and hyperplastic callus formation are among frequently encountered symptoms (1McKusick V.A. Birth Defects Orig. Artic. Ser. 1975; 11: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). The original clinical classification of OI defined four types on the basis of phenotypic severity (2Sillence D.O. Rimoin D.L. Lancet. 1978; 1: 1041-1042Abstract PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Sillence D.O. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 543: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The clinical heterogeneity was reflected by a variety of mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes that are thought to be the underlying cause of most cases of OI (4Sykes B. Nature. 1990; 348: 18-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, a new group of patients have been defined in terms of clinical severity and by the exclusion of type I collagen gene mutations (5Glorieux F.H. Rauch F. Plotkin H. Ward L. Travers R.

Mutat. 2001; 17: 434Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The lack of a clear relationship between collagen mutation and phenotype as well as the absence of type I collagen mutations in the recently defined groups has suggested the involvement of other modifying factors. Proteoglycans (PGs) are a family of molecules that possess a core protein to which one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are covalently attached (7Roden L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, PG core proteins may also possessN- and O-linked oligosaccharides. Human bone cells in culture produce a large versican-like PG, a heparan sulfate syndecan-like PG, as well as biglycan (BGN) and decorin (DCN) (8Beresford J.N. Fedarko N.S. Fisher L.W. Midura R.J. Yanagishita M. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17164-17172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Osteoblast cells derived from OI patients were found to have reduced levels of collagen, osteonectin, large chondroitin sulfate PG, BGN, and DCN when compared with levels found in age-matched control bone cell cultures (9Fedarko N.S. Moerike M. Brenner R. Robey P.G. Vetter U. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The failure of OI osteoblast-like cells to parallel the normal donor age-dependent expression pattern of matrix genes was found to occur throughout long term culture (10Fedarko N.S. Sponseller P.D. Shapiro J.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Osteoblast-like cell strains derived from OI patients had significantly reduced growth parameters (11Fedarko N.S. D'Avis P. Frazier C.R. Burrill M.J. Fergusson V. Tayback M. Sponseller P.D. Shapiro J.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The reduction in maximal cell growth rates and levels of extracellular matrix components observed in OI-derived osteoblast-like cells, although abnormally low compared with age-matched controls, are equivalent to values observed in cells derived from elderly donors >60 years of age (12Fedarko N.S. Vetter U.K. Weinstein S. Robey P.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, OI could be exhibiting facets of normal aging and the observed phenotype of osteopenia and brittle bones would then share certain common features with age-related osteoporosis. The fine structure of PGs have been reported to change as a function of donor age in other organ systems (13Sames K. Jolles P. Proteoglycans. 70. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1994: 243-274Google Scholar). The current study was undertaken to determine whether post-translational modifications to PGs can serve as surrogate biochemical markers to define donor chronological age. These markers were then used to evaluate whether the expression pattern observed in bone cells derived from OI patients were consistent with an accelerated aging where the physiological age of the bone is well advanced beyond chronological age. The biological signals associated with these altered post-translational modifications were investigated. DISCUSSIONPG synthesis begins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum whereN-linked oligosaccharides are added co-translationally to the nascent core protein (43Schwartz N.B. Habib G. Campbell S. D'Elvlyn D. Gartner M. Krueger R. Olson C. Philipson L. Fed. Proc. 1985; 44: 369-372PubMed Google Scholar). Once in the Golgi, high mannoseN-linked oligosaccharides are modified, andO-linked oligosaccharides are added. GAG chain addition begins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and proceeds as the core protein traverses the intracellular secretory pathway (44Schwartz N. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D649-D655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These GAG chains define the class of the PG by a general repeating disaccharide backbone. For heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate PGs, the backbone consists of (hexuronic acid-N-acetylhexosamine)n which can have sulfate ester substituents on either the uronic acid or hexosamine or both (7Roden L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). Dermatan sulfate is distinguished from chondroitin sulfate by the epimerization of glucuronate residues to iduronate and by 2-O-sulfation of those iduronate residues. Heparin is distinguished from heparan sulfate by possessing a higher degree of N-sulfated glucosamine residues and moreO-sulfation (of both the uronic acid and glucosamine residues). Dermatan sulfate containing PGs are defined as mature based on their iduronate content, whereas heparan sulfate containing PGs are defi"

Based on the initial premise to make use of the binding energies of both the substrate and cofactor sites, and molecular modeling starting from the enzyme structure, several estradiol-adenosine hybrids were designed and synthesized. Among these hybrids, EM-1745 with a linker of 8-CH2 groups is proved to be the best competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 3.0 +/- 0.8 nM. The crystal structure of the EM-1745 enzyme complex at 1.6 A provides evidence at atomic resolution of strong interactions between both the steroid and cofactor moieties and the enzyme molecule, as illustrated by a deltaA-weighted 2Fo-Fc electron density map contoured at 3.0 delta. The substrate entry loop is further stabilized in this complex compared with previous complexes of the enzyme. These results confirm our initial strategy of combining studies of structural biology and enzyme mechanism in the inhibitor design, which may be applied to other steroidogenic enzymes involved in human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2168452018,"Functionally active effector T cells are generated through clonal expansion. Most effector T cells are later eliminated, whereas a small number survive and differentiate into memory T cells. The mechanisms by which some effector T cells escape apoptosis and become memory T cells are not understood. Neuropeptides such as the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) inhibit antigen-induced apoptosis of CD4 T cells. By using an in vivo long-term experimental model, in which CD4 T cells from TRC-transgenic mice were transferred into hosts, we demonstrate that VIP and PACAP induce the survival and/or generation of antigen-specific CD4 T cells with a memory Th2 phenotype. This was confirmed by the fact that transgenic CD4 T cells were recovered only from mice that received Th2, but not Th1 effector cells, in the presence of VIP or PACAP. In vitro, VIP/PACAP support the survival of Th2, but not Th1, cell lines through an inhibition of antigen-induced apoptosis. The role of neuropeptides in the biased development of Th2 memory cells is particularly relevant in view of the immune deviation existing in immune-privileged sites such as the brain and eye, where Th2, but not Th1, responses occur in nonpathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1483194907,"The Src tyrosine kinase is necessary for activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) by the β-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol. In this study, we examined the role of Src in the stimulation of two small G proteins, Ras and Rap1, that have been implicated in isoproterenol's signaling to ERKs. We demonstrate that the activation of isoproterenol of both Rap1 and Ras requires Src. In HEK293 cells, isoproterenol activates Rap1, stimulates Rap1 association with B-Raf, and activates ERKs, all via PKA. In contrast, the activation by isoproterenol of Ras requires Gβγ subunits, is independent of PKA, and results in the phosphoinositol 3-kinase-dependent activation of AKT. Interestingly, β-adrenergic stimulation of both Rap1 and ERKs, but not Ras and AKT, can be blocked by a Src mutant (SrcS17A) that is incapable of being phosphorylated and activated by PKA. Furthermore, a Src mutant (SrcS17D), which mimics PKA phosphorylation at serine 17, stimulates Rap1 activation, Rap1/B-Raf association, and ERK activation but does not stimulate Ras or AKT. These data suggest that Rap1 activation, but not that of Ras, is mediated through the direct phosphorylation of Src by PKA. We propose that the β2-adrenergic receptor activates Src via two independent mechanisms to mediate distinct signaling pathways, one through Gαs to Rap1 and ERKs and the other through Gβγ to Ras and AKT.

Because it has been shown that isoproterenol couples efficiently to both Ras and Rap1 in HEK293 cells, this model system provides an opportunity to examine the requirement of Src in each process. Surprisingly, we found that Src was required for the activation of both Ras and Rap1 by isoproterenol. However, it activated Rap1 and Ras through distinct mechanisms.

Cells were maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 prior to treatment with various reagents for immunoprecipitation assay, and Western blotting. In all experiments, cells were treated with EGF (100 ng/ml), isoproterenol (10 μm), or forskolin (10 μm) for 5 min unless otherwise indicated. PP2 (10 μm), H89 (10 μm), and LY294002 (10 μm), were added to cells 20 min prior to treatment, unless otherwise indicated. Cell lysates and Western blotting were prepared as described (7Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3671-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein concentrations were quantified using the Bradford protein assay. For detection of Raf-1, ERK2, Myc-ERK2, FLAG, Rap1, Ras, pERK1/2, Cbl, C3G, and pAKT, equivalent amounts of protein per treatment condition were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) membranes, and probed with the corresponding antibodies according to the manufacturer's guidelines. For immunoprecipitation of Myc-ERK2, Myc-Cbl, FLAG-Src, and HA-AKT equal amounts of cell lysate per condition were precipitated at 4 °C for 4–6 h in lysis buffer. Proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with the indicated antibodies. In all cases, the results illustrated are from representative experiments, repeated at least three times.

The SrcY527F mutants were synthesized using PCR primers containing sequences corresponding to the 5′ end of the Src cDNA and sequences corresponding to the 3′ end of the Src cDNA, with the sequence corresponding to tyrosine 527 replaced with that for phenylalanine (Y527F). SrcWT, SrcS17A, and SrcS17D were amplified with these primers and subcloned into a FLAG-pcDNA3 to create SrcY527F, SrcS17A/Y527F, and SrcS17D/Y527F, respectively.

The transducin (cone) cDNA was provided by the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center (www.guthrie.org/AboutGuthrie/Research/cDNA). Seventy to eighty percent confluent HEK293, SYF, or Src2+ cells were co-transfected with the indicated cDNAs using a LipofectAMINE 2000 kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The control vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp.), was included in each set of transfections to assure that each plate received the same amount of DNA. Following transfection, cells were allowed to recover in serum-containing media for 24 h. Cells were then starved overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before treatment and lysis. A GST fusion protein of the Rap1-binding domain of RalGDS (GST-RalGDS) was expressed inEscherichia coli following induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (GST-RalGDS was a gift from Dr. Johannes Bos, Utrecht University, The Netherlands). Cells were grown as described and were stimulated at 37 °C for the indicated times and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 200 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 μmaprotinin, and 1 mm NaVO4).

Equivalent amounts of supernatants (500 μg) were incubated with the GST-RalGDS-Rap1 binding domain coupled to glutathione beads. Following a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, beads were pelleted and rinsed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, proteins were eluted from the beads using 2× Laemmli buffer and applied to a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked in 5% milk for 1 h, and probed with either α-Rap1/Krev-1 or FLAG antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (or an anti-mouse IgG for anti-FLAG Western blots). Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. All experiments were repeated at least three times and representative gels are shown. HEK293 cells were grown as described, stimulated, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer. Activated Ras was assayed as previously described (7Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3671-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, equivalent amounts of lysates from stimulated cells were incubated with GST-Raf1-RBD (Ras-binding domain) as specified by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY).

Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked at room temperature for 1 h in 5% milk, and probed with either Ras or FLAG antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. All experiments were repeated at least three times and representative gels shown. HEK293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent with polyhistidine-tagged Rap1 (His-Rap1) as previously described (7Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Cell.

Transfected His-tagged proteins were precipitated from supernatants containing equal amounts of protein using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and washed with 20 mm imidazole in lysis buffer and eluted with 500 mm imidazole and 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. The eluates containing His-tagged proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and Raf-1 proteins were detected by Western blotting (7Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Cell.

In HEK293 cells, isoproterenol activated endogenous Rap1 in a PKA-dependent manner, as previously shown (9Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this activation required Src family kinases (SFKs) as it was blocked by the inhibitor PP2 (16Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Isoproterenol also activated endogenous Ras via SFKs, but this proceeded through a PKA-independent pathway (Fig. 1 B). To determine which SFK was mediating these effects, we utilized a pair of cell lines derived from mouse embryo fibroblasts that lack SFKs. One cell line, SYF, was developed from mice deficient in the genes encoding Yes, Fyn, and Src, and has been shown to lack SFK activity (17Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The second cell line, Src2+, originated from mice deficient in only Yes and Fyn and maintained the wild type Src gene and normal Src protein levels (17Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The ability of isoproterenol to activate Rap1 was absent in SYF cells (Fig. 2 A), but was retained in Src2+ cells (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the ability of isoproterenol to activate Ras was also absent in SYF cells (Fig. 2 C), but was retained in Src2+ cells (Fig.2 D). Additionally, both actions of isoproterenol could be reconstituted by transfecting wild type Src (SrcWT) into SYF cells (Fig. 2, A and C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Src is required for activation by isoproterenol of both Ras and Rap1 in these cells. The ability of cAMP to activate Rap1 in selected cell types has recently been shown to require Src and PKA (13Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), through the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Src at serine 17 (Ser17). However, the requirement of Ser17 phosphorylation in hormonal signaling to Ras, Rap1, and ERKs has not been examined. To address the requirement of Ser17 phosphorylation in Ras and Rap1 signaling, we examined their activation by isoproterenol in cells expressing one of two SrcS17 mutants. Unlike SrcWT, the expression of a mutant Src, where Ser17 was replaced with an alanine (SrcS17A), was unable to reconstitute the activation by isoproterenol of Rap1 (Fig.2 A). Moreover, expression of a second Src mutant in which Ser17 was replaced with an aspartate (SrcS17D) resulted in constitutive activation of Rap1 (Fig. 2 A). This is similar to previous results from cells treated with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclases (13Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Importantly, this activation of Rap1 by SrcS17D was not further stimulated by isoproterenol, suggesting that SrcS17D was maximally activating Rap1. The expression of SrcS17A in Src2+ cells inhibited the activation by isoproterenol of Rap1 (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that SrcS17A was interfering with signals through endogenous Src in these cells. In contrast to the response in SYF cells, the activation of Rap1 by SrcS17D and isoproterenol in Src2+ cells was additive (Fig.2 B), presumably reflecting the contribution of the activation by isoproterenol of endogenous Src. Conversely, the activation by isoproterenol of Ras was not blocked by these mutants. In SYF cells, expression of SrcS17A reconstituted Ras activation by isoproterenol to a level similar to that seen using SrcWT (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, in Src2+ cells, SrcS17A did not interfere with Ras activation by isoproterenol but appeared to enhance Ras activation in these cells (Fig. 2 D). On the other hand, SrcS17D was unable to activate Ras in either cell line (Fig. 2 C and D). These data suggest that SrcS17A was capable of mediating a Src-dependent pathway to Ras, demonstrating that the interference of Rap1 activation by SrcS17A in Src2+ cells was selective. Moreover, SrcS17D did not potentiate the stimulation by isoproterenol of Ras in Src2+cells (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that, unlike SrcS17A, SrcS17D alone could not participate efficiently in pathways to activate Ras. Surprisingly, SrcS17D could activate Ras to a moderate degree in SYF cells, but only in conjunction with isoproterenol (Fig. 2 C). This appears inconsistent with the selectivity of SrcS17D toward Rap1. One mechanism by which SrcS17D might function as an activator of Rap1 is to bind endogenous proteins that target Src toward Rap1. In this model, it might be expected that the selectivity of SrcS17D toward Rap1 would not be apparent if it was overexpressed. To examine further the finding that SrcS17D could participate in the activation by isoproterenol of Ras in SYF cells, we compared the effect of increasing concentrations of both transfected SrcWT and SrcS17D in these cells (Fig. 3). Increasing amounts of transfected SrcWT potentiated the activation by isoproterenol of Ras at all concentrations examined, especially at low to moderate doses (Fig.3). In contrast, the ability of SrcS17D to carry a signal from isoproterenol to Ras was only apparent at the highest level of expression examined. Therefore, whereas activation by SrcS17D of Rap1 was not further enhanced by isoproterenol, isoproterenol-dependent activation of Ras by SrcS17D was contingent on overexpression. These data are consistent with a model that SrcS17D interacts with an endogenous protein that channels Src toward a Rap1 pathway, but that when overexpressed, SrcS17D can act independently of this pathway. Next, we examined the mechanism of ERK activation by isoproterenol in HEK293 cells (9Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The ability of isoproterenol to activate Rap1 was modestly enhanced following transfection of SrcWT, but was completely blocked following transfection of SrcS17A (Fig.4 A). These data suggest that SrcS17A can interfere with the ability of endogenous Src to mediate the activation by isoproterenol of Rap1 in HEK293 cells. Expression of SrcS17D activated Rap1 constitutively in these cells, and this was not significantly enhanced by isoproterenol (Fig. 4 A). Upon its activation, Rap1 binds the effector B-Raf to activate ERKs (5Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar,9Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This recruitment of B-Raf has been used as an index of Rap1 activation in a variety of cell types (9Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Guo F. Kumahara E. Saffen D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32490-32497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ability of isoproterenol to stimulate the association of B-Raf with Rap1 was blocked by SrcS17A. SrcS17D stimulated the association of B-Raf with Rap1, and this was modestly enhanced by isoproterenol (Fig.4 B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser17 is required for both Rap1 activation and function. It has previously been suggested that the activation by cAMP of Rap1 by forskolin requires Cbl and the Rap1 exchanger C3G, in NIH3T3 cells (9Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,13Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To examine whether a similar mechanism might underlie signaling from GPCRs, we examined isoproterenol signaling in HEK293 cells expressing two interfering mutants: Cbl-ct, a carboxyl-terminal fragment that blocks Cbl function (13Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and CBR, a truncated protein containing the Crk-binding region of C3G that blocks C3G binding to Crk (9Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The ability of isoproterenol to induce the recruitment by Rap1 of B-Raf was blocked by both Cbl-ct and CBR (Fig. 4 B). Isoproterenol also induced the association of Cbl with SrcWT but not SrcS17A (Fig. 4 C). SrcS17D induced this association in the absence of isoproterenol (Fig.4 C). Similarly, isoproterenol induced an association between C3G and transfected Cbl that was mimicked by SrcS17D, but not SrcS17A (Fig. 4 D). In addition, we detected an isoproterenol-dependent association between wild type Src and C3G that was also mimicked by SrcS17D (Fig. 4 E). This suggests that the association of Cbl/C3G with Src following isoproterenol stimulation was dependent on phosphorylation of Ser17. Mutation of tyrosine 527 of Src to phenylalanine (Y527F) produces a constitutively active (oncogenic) Src by eliminating the inhibitory phosphorylation at Tyr527 (22Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 23Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). This mutant constitutively activated both Ras and Rap1 in HEK293 cells (Fig.5, A and B). However, introduction of S17A in SrcY527F created a new mutant (SrcS17A/Y527F) that was unable to activate Rap1, whereas SrcS17D/Y527F activated Rap1 constitutively (Fig. 5 A). Both SrcS17A/Y527F and SrcS17D/Y527F could activate Ras, suggesting that S17A selectively interfered with oncogenic activation by Src of Rap1. In addition, both Cbl-ct and CBR interfered with Rap1 activation, but had no effect on Ras activation, suggesting that the action of endogenous Cbl and C3G were specific for Rap1. The inability of SrcS17A to interfere with Ras signaling was seen by examining hormonally activated Src in HEK293 cells. Both SrcWT and SrcS17A, but not by SrcS17D, modestly enhanced the activation by isoproterenol of Ras (Fig.6 A). Ras activation by isoproterenol is thought to be mediated via Gβγ (10Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 24Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by experiments in HEK293 cells that showed that the activation by isoproterenol of Ras was blocked by expression of a truncated β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK-ct) (Fig.6 A), and by expression of transducin, a retinal-specific Gαs subunit (Fig. 6 B). Both βARK-ct and transducin block signals generated from βγ subunits by binding to endogenous βγ (2Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 10069-10072Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 25Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). As a control, we show that EGF activation of Ras was not blocked by expression of transducin (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, transducin did not block Rap1 activation by isoproterenol (Fig. 6 C). Taken together, these data suggest that while Ras and Rap1 are both activated by Src-dependent mechanisms downstream of the β-adrenergic receptor, only Ras activation involves Gβγ. To examine the downstream consequences of Src-dependent signaling in HEK293 cells, we measured ERK activation, using pERK antibodies (pERK1/2). Activation by isoproterenol of ERKs required both PKA and SFKs, as phosphorylation of ERK was prevented by both H89 and PP2 (Fig. 7 A). Similar results were seen using forskolin (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, the phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, did not block ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 7 A). Expression of SrcS17A blocked the activation by isoproterenol of ERKs (Fig.8 A), and SrcS17D constitutively activated ERKs (Fig. 8 B), consistent with a model that the activation by Src of Rap1 was necessary and sufficient for the activation by isoproterenol of ERKs in these cells. Moreover, isoproterenol was unable to further activate ERKs in SrcS17D-expressing cells, suggesting that the phosphorylation of SrcS17 was the predominant mode of ERK activation by isoproterenol.Figure 8Activation by isoproterenol of ERKs requires serine 17 phosphorylation of Src. A, PKA phosphorylation of Src on serine 17 is necessary for ERK activation by cAMP. HEK293 cells were transfected with Myc-ERK2 in the presence or absence of SrcS17A, and stimulated with isoproterenol, as indicated. Myc-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using an agarose-coupled Myc antibody followed by Western blotting for phospho-ERK (pMycERK2, upper panel) or total Myc-ERK2 with a Myc antibody, as a control for protein loading (lower panel). B, expression of SrcS17D mimics the activation by isoproterenol of ERKs. HEK293 cells were transfected with Myc-ERK2 in the presence or absence of SrcS17D, and stimulated with isoproterenol, as indicated. Cell lysates were examined as inA for phosphorylated pMyc-ERK2 and expression of pMyc-ERK2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previously, we and others have suggested that Ras was not required for ERK activation by isoproterenol in HEK293 cells (9Schmitt J.M.

To examine the physiological role of Ras signaling in these cells, we examined a well known Ras effector, PI3K and its target, AKT (26Downward J. Curr."
https://openalex.org/W1980432996,"Vision requires a reference frame. To what extent does this reference frame depend on the structure of the visual input, rather than just on retinal landmarks? This question is particularly relevant to the perception of dynamic scenes, when keeping track of external motion relative to the retina is difficult. We tested human subjects' ability to discriminate the motion and temporal coherence of changing elements that were embedded in global patterns and whose perceptual organization was manipulated in a way that caused only minor changes to the retinal image. Coherence discriminations were always better when local elements were perceived to be organized as a global moving form than when they were perceived to be unorganized, individually moving entities. Our results indicate that perceived form influences the neural representation of its component features, and from this, we propose a new method for studying perceptual organization."

Biochemical experiments have shown that myosin-I membrane binding is the result of electrostatic interactions between the basic tail domain and acidic phospholipids.

The dissociation rate of the slow component is slower than the myo1c ATPase rate, suggesting that myo1c is able to stay associated with the lipid membrane during multiple catalytic cycles of the motor.

Cyt. 2000; 200: 197-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionations of vertebrate cells indicate that most myosin-I is associated with the membrane and cytoskeleton fractions with only a small soluble pool (2Ruppert C. Godel J. Müller R.T.

However, very little is known about the control of myosin-I localization and membrane association, though it has been proposed that calcium-calmodulin and phosphorylation play roles in modulating membrane attachment (7Swanljung-Collins H. Collins J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3445-3454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrostatic interactions play an important role in the binding of myosin-I to membranes. Positively charged tail domains of myosin-I bind to acidic phospholipids without any apparent specificity toward the acidic head groups (8Hayden S.M. Wolenski J.S. Mooseker M.S. J.

To better understand the dynamics and regulation of myo1c membrane association, we determined the lipid association and dissociation rate constants using a recombinant protein construct containing the three IQ domains and the C-terminal tail region of myo1c (myo1c-tail). Membrane association was detected by fluorescence resonance energy transfer from myo1c-tail tryptophans to dansyl-labeled phosphatidylserine (18Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L.

All experiments were performed in HNa100 (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmDTT).1 Calcium concentrations were adjusted by adding CaCl2 to HNa100 and are reported as free calcium. All kinetic experiments were performed with 2 μm excess calmodulin. Phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine-N-5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl (dPS) were purchased as chloroform stocks (Avanti Polar Lipids). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by extrusion. Lipid components were mixed in the desired ratios in chloroform and dried completely under a stream of nitrogen. Lipids were resuspended in HNa100 to a total concentration of 2 mm and were subjected to five cycles of freeze-thaw. Lipids were then passed through 100-nm filters (11 times) using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). LUVs were discarded after 1 day. PS percentages reported throughout the text are the mole percentages of total PS (PS + dPS) with PC making up the remaining lipid. All fluorescent LUVs (dLUVs) contain 5% dPS. Lipid concentrations are given as total lipid (PC + PS + dPS). We cloned and expressed myo1c-tail (amino acids 690–1028), which consists of three IQ motifs, the tail domain, and an N-terminal HIS6 tag for purification. The cDNA for myo1c was kindly provided by D. P. Corey (Massachusetts General Hospital), and the appropriate bases were amplified with the following primers: 5′-cgcggatcctatgcatcaccatcaccatcacggcgccacagaggactccct-3′ and 5′-cggggtacctcaccgagaattcagccgtg-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac4.5 (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculovirus was generated using standard procedures and screened by plaque assay. Myo1c-tail with bound calmodulin was purified from Sf9 cells that were co-infected with virus containing recombinant myo1c-tail and calmodulin. Cells were suspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% igepal, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C and homogenized with five strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Cell extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was sonicated three times for 15 s, incubated with 10 μg/ml RNase A and 5 μg/ml DNase I on ice for 15 min, and loaded on to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of the same buffer without igepal. Myo1c-tail was eluted with 5 ml of 125 mm imidazole, 300 mmNaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μm calmodulin (Fig. 1). The elution was diluted in 15 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and loaded on to MonoS column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT. Myo1c-tail was separated and eluted with a linear 50 mm-1 m NaCl gradient. Myo1c-tail with bound calmodulin elutes at 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing myo1c-tail were combined and dialyzed versus 1 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmEGTA, and 1 mm DTT and loaded on to MonoQ column (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT (Fig. 1). Myo1c-tail was eluted with a linear 25 mm-1 m KCl gradient (Fig. 1 A). Myo1c-tail with bound calmodulin elutes at 0.43m KCl. Fractions containing myo1c-tail were combined and concentrated to one-fifth volume using Microsep concentrators (Pall Filtron). The concentrated protein was dialyzed versusHNa100. Myo1c-tail concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus assay (Pierce). Quantitative scanning of protein gels labeled with SYPRO Red (Molecular Probes) indicates that approximately three calmodulins are bound per tail (not shown). A typical yield of myo1c-tail with bound calmodulin from 4 liters of cells is ∼1 mg. Myo1c-tail with bound calmodulin (1 nmol) was added to 50 μl of nickel beads (Qiagen) and equilibrated in HNa100 with 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol instead of 1 mm DTT. Myo1c-tail-bound beads (0.4 μm protein) were sedimented in HNa100 with 100 μm 80% PS LUVs in the absence or presence of 250 μm free calcium by spinning at 3000 × g for 4 min. No free calmodulin was added to the buffer. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were suspended to original volume in HNa100. Proteins in the supernatant and pellets were resolved on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with SYPRO Red. Protein bands were scanned and visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The protein bands shown in Fig.1 B are from the same gel scan and are shown at identical exposure and identical gray-level scale. Transient kinetic measurements were made at 25 ± 0.1 °C with an Applied Photophysics (Surrey, UK) SX.18MV stopped-flow fluorometer. Tryptophan was excited with a monochromator set at 285 nm (2.3-nm slit width). A 440-nm long-pass filter (Oriel) was used to detect dansyl fluorescence. Experimental transients were fitted with software supplied with the instrument. All stated concentrations are those after mixing (i.e. the final reaction concentrations). The mixing ratio of the stopped-flow apparatus was 1:1, thus the concentrations in the stopped-flow syringes before mixing are two times those reported. Association transients were obtained by mixing myo1c-tails with dLUVs. Two to eight association transients were averaged before non-linear least-squares fitting. Dissociation transients were obtained by mixing pre-equilibrated myo1c-tail-dLUVs complexes with a large molar excess of unlabeled 80% PS LUVs. When mixed, myo1c-tails that dissociate from dLUVs have a much higher probability of rebinding to unlabeled LUVs resulting in decreased dLUVs fluorescence. Reported dissociation rates are the averages of four to eight transients from three different protein preparations. A fluorescence increase upon binding of myo1c-tail to dPS-containing LUVs (dLUVs) allowed us to monitor the rate of association of myo1c-tail with lipid. Fluorescence time courses of myo1c-tail binding to dLUVs in the absence (Fig.2 A) and presence of 250 μm free calcium (Fig. 2 B) follow single exponential rates that depend linearly on the total lipid concentration (Fig. 2 C). We did not detect lag phases, deviations from single exponential time courses, or fluorescence increases at longer time scales. However, a mixing artifact at high lipid concentrations (≥100 μm) limited our ability to analyze the first 50 ms of the transient (Fig. 2, A and B). The apparent second-order rate constant for the binding of myo1c-tail to 40% PS dLUVs (0.16 ± 0.02 μm−1s−1) was the same as 60% PS dLUVs (0.18 ± 0.01 μm−1 s−1). However, the apparent rate of association was significantly reduced for both 40% PS (0.020 ± 0.01 μm−1 s−1) and 60% PS (0.049 ± 0.02 μm−1s−1) dLUVs in the presence of 250 μm free calcium. Calcium alone does not affect the fluorescence of dLUVs. The rate of myo1c-tail dissociation from dLUVs was measured by mixing myo1c-tail-dLUVs with excess unlabeled 80% PS LUVs (see “Material and Methods”). After mixing, the starting fluorescence (F +tail) decreased to the fluorescence level of dLUVs in the absence of tail (F −tail), indicating complete dissociation of tail from dLUVs (Fig. 3 A). The signal-to-noise ratios of the dissociation curves (Fig. 3 A) were much better than the association curves (Fig. 2) because the longer time scales allowed for longer signal integration times. Fluorescence time-courses of dissociation were best fit by a two-exponential rate function (Fig. 3 A). The fast (k fast) and slow (k slow) rates were dependent on the mole fraction of total PS in the dLUVs at a single myo1c-tail concentration (Fig. 3 B). The relative amplitude of the fast component (A fast) decreased from ∼70% of the total signal change at 20% PS to <40% of the total signal change at 80% PS. The dissociation rate was examined as a function of myo1c-tail concentration at a single 20% PS lipid concentration (Fig.4 A). At the lowest myo1c-tail concentrations tested (15–25 nm), fluorescence transients were adequately fit with a single-exponential rate function. At protein concentrations >25 nm, a two-exponential fit was required. The rate of k fast increased significantly between 25 and 100 nm myo1c-tail and did not increase at >100 nm myo1c-tail. The rate ofk slow showed a small dependence on the myo1c-tail concentration (Fig. 4 A). The amplitude of the slow component (A slow) reached its maximum level at ∼100 nm myo1c-tail then slightly decreased, and A fast reached its maximum level at ∼200 nm myo1c-tail. The total amplitude of the fluorescence change (A slow +A fast) reached its maximum at 200 nm myo1c-tail, indicating that the tail binding sites on the dLUVs were saturated at this concentration (Fig.5). To better understand the relationship between the dissociation rate and the PS content of LUVs, we measured dissociation as a function of myo1c-tail concentration (15–375 nm) from 20%, 40%, and 60% PS dLUVs (Fig.6). The rates of the fast and slow components are plotted as a function of moles of PS/moles of myo1c-tail (Fig. 6). The dependence of the rate on the PS/tail ratio is nearly identical for dLUVs of the different PS percentages. Therefore, the dependence of the dissociation rate of the fast component on the percentage PS at a single myo1c-tail concentration (Fig. 3 B) is due to the variation in the PS/tail ratio, and it is not a function of the percentage of PS or PC in a vesicle. The myo1c-tail dissociation rate from 20% PS dLUVs was examined as a function of myo1c-tail concentration in the presence of 250 μm free calcium. As shown previously for myo1c and other myosin-I isoforms (reviewed in Ref. 1Sokac A.M. Bement W.M. Int. Rev. Cyt. 2000; 200: 197-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), calcium weakens the affinity of calmodulin for myo1c-tails. This is seen by the partial dissociation of calmodulin from myo1c-tails bound to beads in a pull-down experiment in the presence of 250 μm calcium (Fig.1 B). The dissociation transients in the presence of calcium were best fit to two-exponential rates at all myo1c-tail concentrations.k fast and k slow (Fig.4 C) and their associated amplitudes,A fast and A slow (Fig.4 D), showed a much smaller dependence on the myo1c-tail concentration than in the absence of calcium. The starting fluorescence levels of the dissociation transients in the presence of calcium (F +tail) were the same as those obtained in the absence of calcium (Fig. 3 A), suggesting equivalent binding of myo1c-tail to dLUVs. However, the total amplitude change (A fast + A slow) of the transient after mixing with unlabeled LUVs in the presence of calcium was >2-fold less than the expected signal change (F +tail – F −tail) at almost every myo1c-tail concentration tested (Fig. 5), suggesting that >60% of myo1c-tail does not dissociate from the dLUVs under experimental conditions. A further amplitude change was not observed when the acquisition time was increased to 1000 s. A further decrease in the fluorescence signal was also not observed when the plus-calcium dissociation reaction was mixed with 10 mmEGTA to chelate the free calcium, thus indicating that the effect of calcium on myo1c-tail dissociation is not reversible on the time scale of the experiments (not shown). Similar calcium effects on the rates and amplitudes were observed with 40% PS dLUVs (data not shown). Association transients follow a single exponential at all concentrations tested. The rate constants for myo1c-tail binding to 40% PS and 60% PS LUVs in the absence of calcium were not statistically different, suggesting that the association rate is not dependent on the PS percentages that we tested. If we assume that the molecular weight of an LUV is ∼1.2 × 108 (20Lu Y. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8193-8200Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), then the apparent second-order rate constant for binding in terms of LUV concentration is ∼2 × 1010m−1 s−1 for 40% PS and 60% PS. This rate is on the same order as the collisional association rate (1–3 × 1010m−1s−1) as estimated by the Smoluchowski equation (20Lu Y. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8193-8200Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H. Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Therefore, nearly every tail-vesicle interaction in the absence of calcium results in binding. In most cases, dissociation transients are not described by single exponential functions (Fig. 3 A), so dissociation can not be modeled as a single-step process limited by one rate constant. We propose a simple model in which the dissociation rate depends on the number of PS molecules bound to each tail: the myo1c-tail is in equilibrium between two states that differ in the number of tail-bound PS molecules; and the relative populations of the two states in the absence of calcium are determined in part by the PS/tail ratio. At high PS/tail ratios, myo1c-tails do not compete with each other for PS, and a single slowly dissociating population predominates. We can estimate the effective number of PS molecules bound to the slowly dissociating population by examining the myo1c-dependent changes in k fast andk slow. Fig. 6 shows that the rate of the fast component approaches the rate of the slow component at ∼100 PS/tail. If 50% of the lipid is inaccessible due to its location within the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, then the effective number of PS molecules bound to each slowly dissociating tail is ∼50. At low PS/tail ratios, myo1c-tails compete with each other for PS, resulting in a fraction of tails with <50 bound PS molecules. Fewer electrostatic interactions between PS and tail result in an increased rate of dissociation. The fast component reaches its maximum rate at ∼25 PS/tail (Fig. 6), suggesting that the minimum number of PS molecules bound to a tail is ∼13. The rate of the slow component also increases at high myo1c-tail concentrations (Fig. 4 A), which might be due to fewer PS molecules bound to the tail or to steric effects due to saturation of lipid with protein. At the lowest PC/tail ratios in the absence of calcium, the slow component represents 20–30% of the total dissociation amplitude for dLUVs containing 20% PS (Fig 4 B), 40% PS (not shown), and 60% PS (not shown). Therefore, there are factors other than the PS/tail ratio that define the relative population of the fast and slow dissociating components (22Berg H.C. Purcell E.M. Biophys. J. 1977; 20: 193-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). These may include cooperative association of PS with membrane-bound tails or stable conformational states of the protein that do not bind less than 50 PS molecules. The rate of lipid association is decreased ∼3-fold in the presence of 250 μm free calcium. The apparent second-order rate constants expressed in terms of dLUVs concentration (rather than total lipid) are 3 × 109m−1 s−1 for 40% PS dLUVs and 8 × 109 for 60% PS dLUVs. Therefore, even in the presence of very high calcium concentrations, the rate of association of myo1c-tail with lipids is very fast. We do not know why the rate constant for lipid binding is decreased in the presence of calcium. However, possibilities include competition between calcium and myo1c-tail for PS and alteration of the myo1c-tail conformation by calcium binding. As in the absence of calcium, dissociation transients are best fit to a two-exponential rate function in the presence of 250 μmfree calcium. k fast andk slow do not show any dependence on the myo1c-tail concentration, and the total fluorescence amplitudes of the transients (A fast +A slow) are >2-fold smaller than in the absence of calcium (Fig. 5). The starting fluorescence levels (F +tail) of the dissociation transients in the presence and absence of calcium are the same, so it is unlikely that the decreased amplitudes are due to fewer lipid-bound myo1c-tails. Rather, a large fraction of the myo1c-tails remain lipid-bound and do not dissociate on the time scale of our measurements. Qualitative lipid sedimentation experiments also suggest that calcium does not decrease myo1c-tail binding to LUVs (not shown). Experiments with myo1a (brush border myosin-I) suggest that calcium increases the number of myosin-I molecules bound to lipid vesicles (7Swanljung-Collins H. Collins J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3445-3454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the similar fluorescence levels (F +tail) in the presence and absence of calcium in the present study suggest that this is not the case for myo1c (Fig. 3). Highly stable protein-lipid interactions mediated by electrostatic interactions are not unique to myo1c. For example, protein kinase C has been shown to dissociate from PS-containing vesicles with a half-time >24 h (23Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7970-7977Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has been proposed for myo1a that calcium dissociates myosin-bound calmodulin unmasking positive charges that can bind acidic phospholipids (7Swanljung-Collins H. Collins J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3445-3454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because calcium weakens the affinity of calmodulin for myo1c and myo1c-tail (Fig. 1 B; see Ref. 1Sokac A.M. Bement W.M. Int. Rev. Cyt. 2000; 200: 197-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar for review), we suggest that myo1c-tail follows a similar mechanism, resulting in a highly stable protein-lipid interaction. Such a mechanism might explain the data of Cyr et al. (24Cyr J.L. Dumont R.A. Gillespie P.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2487-2495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which shows that the IQ motifs play a role in directing subcellular localization of myo1c. However, it remains to be determined if a calmodulin-dissociated state of myo1c is physiological. It is also possible that calcium mediates an electrostatic interaction between a cluster of negative charges on the tail and PS as seen for other membrane-binding proteins (25Nelsestuen G.L. Ostrowski B.G. Curr. Opin. Str. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In either case, the calcium effect is not reversible under our experimental conditions and time scales, so it is possible that other regulatory elements play a role in mediating membrane attachment/detachment in the presence of calcium. The steady-state actin-activated ATPase rate of myo1c under calcium-free conditions similar to the present experiments is 0.5 s−1(26Gillespie P.G. Gillespie S.K. Mercer J.A. Shah K. Shokat K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31373-31381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which is 10-fold faster than k slow(0.02–0.06 s−1). At high PS/tail ratios, most myo1c motors should be able to undergo several catalytic cycles before dissociating from the membrane. Therefore, an “anchoring” protein is not necessary to keep the motor associated with the membrane under these conditions. Remarkably, k slow is nearly identical to the fluorescence-recovery-after-photobleach rate of green fluorescent protein-myo1a and green fluorescent protein-myo1a-tail as measured in the brush border of kidney epithelial cells (5Tyska M.J. Mooseker M.S. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1869-1883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, if membrane-associated tail-binding proteins are present in brush border microvilli, we predict that they do not increase the lifetime of membrane association. The magnitude of k fast (0.2–1.0 s−1) is on the same order as the myo1c ATPase rate in the absence of calcium. So under conditions where the fast component predominates (i.e. low PS/tail ratios), the probability that myo1c will perform a power stroke while bound to a membrane is greatly decreased. The acidic phospholipid content in the membrane is regulated in both concentration and in spatial distribution (27Anderson R.G.W. Jacobson K. Science. 2002; 296: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Therefore, the membrane dissociation rate of cellular myosin-I might be coupled directly to the regulation of lipid charge and acidic phospholipid density. The motor domain of myosin-I interacts preferentially with tropomyosin-free actin filaments (4Tang N. Ostap E.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1131-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Fanning A.S. Wolenski J.S. Mooseker M.S. Izant J.G. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1995; 29: 29-45Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), so tropomyosin and spatially regulated actin polymerization play important roles in specifying the subcellular localization of myosin-I (4Tang N. Ostap E.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1131-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the absence of a specific myosin-I tail receptor, as in ruffling membranes (2Ruppert C. Godel J. Müller R.T. Kroschewski R. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tang N. Ostap E.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1131-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we predict that myosin-I will associate with acidic phospholipids adjacent to tropomyosin-free actin. Assuming a high acidic lipid/tail ratio, these membrane-linked motors can perform multiple power strokes as they move toward the barbed end of the actin filament. Because myosin-I membrane interactions are relatively nonspecific, this model predicts that multiple myosin-I isoforms will concentrate on the same cellular membranes. Overlapping localization of vertebrate myosin-I isoforms has been shown (1Sokac A.M. Bement W.M. Int. Rev. Cyt. 2000; 200: 197-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 2Ruppert C. Godel J. Müller R.T. Kroschewski R. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that myosin-I isoforms have distinct non-overlapping localizations in certain subcellular regions (2Ruppert C. Godel J. Müller R.T. Kroschewski R. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus it is likely that myosin-I tails contain information for specifying localization to specific cellular regions (2Ruppert C. Godel J. Müller R.T. Kroschewski R. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tang N. Ostap E.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1131-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Further experiments are required to better understand the mechanisms and regulation of myosin-I targeting."

These transgenic mice have a lower body weight, and when related to body weight, food intake and energy expenditure are increased. A specific reduction of muscle mass was observed but varied according to the contractile activity of muscles. Heart and soleus muscle are unaffected, indicating that muscles undergoing regular contractions, and therefore with a continuous mitochondrial ATP production, are protected. In contrast, the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles showed a severely reduced mass and a fast to slow shift in fiber types promoting mainly IIa and IIx fibers at the expense of fastest and glycolytic type IIb fibers. These observations are interpreted as a consequence of the strong potential dependence of the UCP1 protonophoric activity, which ensures a negligible proton leak at the membrane potential observed when mitochondrial ATP production is intense. Therefore UCP1 is not deleterious for an intense mitochondrial ATP production and this explains the tolerance of the heart to a high expression level of UCP1. In muscles at rest, where ATP production is low, the rise in membrane potential enhances UCP1 activity. The proton return through UCP1 mimics the effect of a sustained ATP production, permanently lowering mitochondrial membrane potential.

UCP1 allows return of protons into the matrix without ATP synthesis, and therefore dissipates the proton electrochemical gradient built up after proton pumping by the respiratory complexes. When this gradient reaches high values this makes proton pumping and thus substrate oxidation less easy and therefore slows down respiration. Activity of UCP1 prevents this rise of the proton gradient and therefore allows respiration to occur at a high rate, without phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, and therefore energy is instantaneously released as heat. The essential role of the UCP1 in thermogenesis is illustrated by the cold intolerance of mice whose ucp1 gene has been disrupted (3Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Recently, two genes coding for proteins highly homologous to UCP1 have been described (reviewed in Refs. 4Boss O. Hagen T. Lowell B.B.

Although there are experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis of an uncoupling activity of these proteins (7Rial E. Gonzalez-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S. Sanchis D. Jimenez-Jimenez J.

We intended to obtain transgenic mice overexpressing the UCP1 in skeletal muscles, with the aim of examining the effects of the presence of this uncoupling protein on the pattern of myosin expression and metabolic characteristics of locomotor muscles. Two other reports published describe transgenic mice either overexpressing UCP3 (12Clapham J.C. Arch J.R. Chapman H. Haynes A. Lister C. Moore G.B. Piercy V. Carter S.A. Lehner I. Smith S.A.

Semenkovich C.F. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In both cases increased energy expenditure resulted in a lower body weight. Few or no functional data about the activity of the uncoupling proteinin vivo or in vitro have been produced. In our model of transgenic mice we have obtained a high expression level of UCP1 in skeletal muscles and heart. We produce data concerning the activity of the UCP1 in isolated mitochondria and in vivousing NMR of phosphorylated intermediates. UCP1 expression in skeletal muscle induced many alterations in muscle mass, myosin composition, and metabolic characteristics, which were related to the function and contractile activity of muscles. We examined how these alterations could be explained by the functional characteristics of UCP1. By the use of classical molecular biology techniques, the cDNA coding for the rat UCP1 associated with the SV40 polyadenylation sequence was ligated at the BstEII site of the mouse muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter from the −3300MCKCAT construct, kindly provided by Dr. S. Levak Franck and Dr. S. D. Hauschka (14Jaynes J.B. Chamberlain J.S. Buskin J.N. Johnson J.E. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ThisBstEII site is located seven bases downstream of the transcription start site. Therefore, the MCK promoter drives the transcription of the rat UCP1 mRNA. A PstI site was added after the SV40 polyadenylation sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. This plasmid, called pMCK-UCP1, was used to prepare the DNA injected into mouse eggs. The integrity of the UCP1 cDNA sequence was checked by DNA sequencing. Digestion with PstI released the transgene (MCK promoter, UCP1 cDNA, SV40 polyadenylation site) free of vector sequences. This fragment called MCK-UCP1 was isolated from an agarose gel by electroelution. The DNA was microinjected into pronuclei of single cell embryos obtained from B6D2F1 parents (Iffa-Credo l'Arbresle, France) and the injected embryos were transplanted into the oviduct of pseudopregnant foster mothers. After preparation of DNA from tail, transgenic offspring were identified by PCR amplification of the rat UCP1 cDNA. Positives thus identified were checked for the integrity of the transgene by performing Southern blot analysis. Our attempts to establish stable homozygous lines of both lines have hitherto failed. Although mating of homozygotes could yield progeny, subsequent mating failed. Consequently, the animals used were the offspring of matings of hemizygotes, and control animals were littermates of the transgenics, which provide the best control available with these progeny of hybrid mice. The body weights of the mice were determined weekly. As controls we used offspring of the same strain (B6D2F1) that were not transgenic for the MCK-UCP1 gene including brothers and sisters of the MCK-UCP1-positive mice. The body weight controls did not differ from the reference value for the B6D2F1 strain determined by the supplier (Iffa Credo, l'Arbresles, France). Mice (10–46 weeks of age) were sacrificed and dissected to measure the fresh weight of different organs. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry allows the determination of fat mass (15Sjogren K.

The measurements were performed with a PIXImus mouse densitometer (Lunar France, Lambesc, France). The mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (0.6 mg/kg) (Sanofi, Libourne, France) before scanning and placed with their stomach down in the PIXImus. The fat percent calculated by the software was used. Food intake was determined by estimating the amount of food (chow diet M25 Pietremont, Provins, France, energy content: 346 kilocalories/100 g) consumed by the mice. Mice (10–30 weeks of age) were housed individually, and their body weight and food intake was measured at intervals varying from 1 to 7 days. Cages were inspected for food spillage but none was noticed. The food intake per day was calculated for each mouse by dividing the cumulated food intake over the entire period of the experiment by the total number of days of the experiment. Energy expenditure of individual mice was measured over 2 days using indirect calorimetry as described in Ref. 16Klaus S. Munzberg H. Truloff C. Heldmaier G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R287-R293PubMed Google Scholar. In short, oxygen consumption and CO2 production were determined every 6 min in an open respirometric system and energy expenditure was calculated according to Ref. 17Weir J.B. J. Physiol. 1949; 109: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (3984) Google Scholar. Total energy expenditure was calculated as a 24-h mean. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Muscles from the legs or heart were collected from 3 to 5 mice. Tissues were chopped with scissors and homogenized in a Potter homogenizer with a Teflon pestle in the presence of nargase (Sigma number P4789) at 6–9 mg/ml at 0 °C. A first centrifugation step at 10,000 × g was used to eliminate the nargase with the supernatant. The pellet was gently resuspended in homogenization medium and this suspension was used to isolate mitochondria by differential centrifugation. Mitochondrial respiration was monitored with a Clark oxygen electrode (Hansatech, Norfolk, England), and membrane potential was measured with a home-made TPP+ electrode following published procedures (18Locke R.M. Rial E. Scott I.D. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For flow cytometry, mitochondria were diluted to a concentration of 2 μg/ml in the respiration medium containing 100 nmrhodamine 123 (Molecular Probes). Staining in the presence of substrate was allowed to proceed for approximately 3 min (separate experiments confirmed that a stable value of fluorescence is reached after 150 s and is maintained up to 5 min). Analysis was done with an EPICS Coulter XL flow cytometer. Particles (mitochondria) were detected by means of side scatter. Changes in the expression of MHC isoforms were examined in two fast twitch and one mixed skeletal muscles (gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles, respectively). Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (70 mg/kg body weight) administered intraperitoneally. Gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles were excised, cleaned of adipose and connective tissue, and wet weighed. Muscles were slightly stretched to recoil passively to a roughly resting length, mounted in an embedding medium (TEK O.C.T. compound), and frozen in isopentane cooled to its freezing point (−160 °C) by liquid nitrogen. Changes in the relative amounts of MHC isoforms were assessed using immunohistochemical detection of MHCs within single muscle fibers, and SDS-PAGE to separate MHC isoforms in whole muscle. Serial transverse sections (10 μm thick) were cut from the midbelly portion in a cryostat maintained at −20 °C and were incubated in a humid chamber in working solutions of mouse monoclonal antibodies that reacted either with slow type I (number NCL-MHCS, Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom), or fast type IIa MHC (SC-71), or all adult fast and developmentally regulated epitopes but not with slow myosin (MY-32, Sigma). The avidin-biotin immunohistochemical procedure was used for the localization of antigen-antibody binding (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). A sample of ∼400 fibers that were free from artifacts were randomly selected from fields equally distributed over the biopsy for single fiber MHC composition. Fibers were classified according to their staining profile as comprising type I, type IIa or type IIx, and/or type IIb MHC with the aid of a microscope linked to a computer-based image analysis system (Visiolab 200, Nikon-France). Negative control slides with omission of the primary antibodies were randomly included in the immunostaining procedures. Four to five areas were randomly selected on each sample and the mean fiber cross-sectional area was determined for fibers containing type I, type IIa, or type IIx, and/or type IIb (type IIb/IIx fibers) MHC isoforms. SDS-PAGE analyses were performed according to Talmadge and Roy (19Talmadge R.J. Roy R.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 2337-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Myosin was extracted with 3 volumes of 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol (pH 8.5). The separating gel solution contained 30% glycerol, 8% acrylamide-bis (50:1), 0.2 m Tris, 0.1m glycine, and 0.4% SDS. The composition of the stacking gel was 30% glycerol, 4% acrylamide-bis (50:1), 70 mmTris, 4 mm EDTA, and 0.4% SDS. Electrophoresis was performed using a Mini-Protean II system (Bio-Rad). Gels were run at a constant voltage (70 V) for ∼28 h, and then stained with Coomassie Blue. The MHC protein isoform bands were scanned and quantified using a densitometer system equipped with an integrator (GS-700, Bio-Rad). 31P NMR of mouse gastrocnemius was carried out using a Bruker Biospec 47/50 (Bruker Medizintechnik GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a 50-cm bore superconducting magnet operating at 4.7 T. For this purpose, a 1-cm transmit/receive radiofrequency coil tuned at 81 MHz was designed to ensure correct localization of the NMR signal. Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and positioned prone in the magnet. The R F coil was placed close to the gastrocnemius and proton shimming was done to reach a line width at half-height of typically 50 Hz for the water resonance. Fully relaxed31P NMR spectra (100-μs R F pulse, 20-s interpulse delay, 1024 data points, 128 free induction decays, 30 Hz Lorentzian filter before Fourier transformation) were acquired within 34 min. Spectra were then analyzed (Igor Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) as a sum of Lorentzian-Gaussian line shaped resonances to determine the areas of the nucleoside triphosphate and the phosphocreatine (PCr) resonances. The PCr/ATP ratio was calculated as the phosphocreatine to β-nucleoside triphosphate resonance area ratio. Two independent transgenic lines were obtained. Both express UCP1 mRNA in skeletal muscles and heart (Fig. 1). No expression of the UCP1 mRNA was found in liver or brain, indicating that the tissue specificity of the MCK promoter was retained in these transgenic lines. However, the expression level of the UCP1 mRNA varies from one muscle to another, and these variations were not consistent in the two transgenic lines: the MCK-UCP1–13 showed highest expression in the heart, and the MCK-UCP1–20 in the gastrocnemius. The other muscles examined (soleus and plantaris) showed relatively similar mRNA levels in both transgenic lines. The expression of the mitochondrial transcription factor 1 (20Larsson N.G. Garman J.D. Oldfors A. Barsh G.S. Clayton D.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Gordon J.W. Rungi A.A. Inagaki H. Hood D.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was examined as well as the expression of the MEF2C transcription factor (22McDermott J.C. Cardoso M.C., Yu, Y.T. Andres V.

A quantitative analysis showed no consistent correlation between UCP1 mRNA and mitochondrial transcription factor 1 mRNA expression levels nor was there a correlation between UCP1 mRNA and MEF2C mRNA expression (data not shown). The amount of UCP1 in the mitochondria isolated from leg muscles or heart was estimated by Western blotting (Fig. 1). A similar amount of UCP1 was found in the skeletal muscle mitochondria of both lines, and this amount compares well with the level of UCP1 in brown fat mitochondria. As expected, the two transgenic lines differ with respect to the amount of UCP1 found in the heart mitochondria with a significantly higher level found in the MCK-UCP1–13 line. The body weight of mice was measured (see Fig. 2). After 5 weeks transgenic mice showed an almost stable deficit in body weight of 30%. Animals were dissected and the weight of different organs was measured. For most organs (Table I) the relative weight was unchanged. Brain and liver conserved their absolute weight and consequently showed a higher relative weight in transgenics (data not shown). The comparison of the lean and fat mass measured by x-ray tomography (Fig. 2, bottom) indicated that transgenic mice and 64% (7Rial E. Gonzalez-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S. Sanchis D. Jimenez-Jimenez J. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5827-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) of their controls shared an identical percentage of body fat of about 15%. On the other hand, in this experiment 36% (4Boss O. Hagen T. Lowell B.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) of the control animals had a significantly higher percentage of body fat. Therefore two types of animals were found in control mice, and the trend toward a lower percentage of body fat in transgenics is explained by this heterogeneity of controls. Whatever the cause of this distribution of body fat percentage in controls, it seems likely that the presence of UCP1 prevents the occurrence of a higher percentage of body fat, but does not reduce it to below the 15% found in the majority of controls. Blood glucose levels in milligrams/dl measured in the fasted state were 72 ± 7 for males (n = 11) and 61 ± 3 for females (n = 10) in the control mice. In the transgenic mice the values were 70 ± 7 (n = 10) for males (p = 0.78 with control) and 51 ± 3 (n = 10) for females (p = 0.057 with control). In the fed state these mice showed values between 115 and 120 mg/dl with no significant differences between control and transgenic mice. No differences between transgenic mice and their controls were found for plasma triglycerides or cholesterol. However, transgenic mice showed a statistically significant reduction in plasma creatinine concentration (both males and females) and in urea (males only), changes that are consistent with their reduced muscle mass.Table IRelative organ weightControlMCK-UCP1mg/gLeg38.9 ± 0.37 (12)24.2ap ≤ 0.001. ± 0.39 (19)Heart5.3 ± 0.04 (12)5.2 ± 0.07 (19)Brain15.1 ± 0.22 (9)21.8ap ≤ 0.001. ± 0.24 (13)Liver51.1 ± 0.63 (12)62.1ap ≤ 0.001. ± 0.32 (19)Kidneys15.2 ± 0.21 (12)14.7 ± 0.11 (19)Lung6.3 ± 0.12 (12)6.6 ± 0.12 (12)Spleen3.5 ± 0.08 (10)4.1 ± 0.11 (16)Uterus4.4 ± 0.10 (6)4.9 ± 0.16 (11)Organ weight is given in relative values: milligrams of organ per g of body weight (mean ± S.E.).

The food intake of transgenic mice was the same as that of the controls (Table II). Consequently when this food intake was corrected for body weight, this made the transgenic mice hyperphagic. Hypermetabolism must compensate for this increased food intake. Accordingly, the relation between total energy expenditure and body weight was found to be altered in transgenics when compared with controls (Fig. 3).Table IIFood intakeAgeBody weightFood intakeFood intakeFood intakeweeksgg/dayKJ/day/BWKJ/day/BW0.75FemalesControl n = 1419.5 ± 1.322.7 ± 1.13.0 ± 0.21.97 ± 0.184.25 ± 0.36Hemizygote n = 1217.0 ± 1.817.9ap < 0.05. ± 0.53.2 ± 0.12.56bp < 0.01. ± 0.055.26cp < 0.001. ± 0.12Homozygote n = 1119.4 ± 1.518.0ap < 0.05. ± 0.43.3 ± 0.12.62bp < 0.01. ± 0.085.41bp < 0.01. ± 0.17MalesControl n = 1224.3 ± 2.133.1 ± 1.53.6 ± 0.11.62 ± 0.103.85 ± 0.20Hemizygote n = 1820.8 ± 2.322.3ap < 0.05. ± 0.73.8 ± 0.12.46ap < 0.05. ± 0.075.32ap < 0.05. ± 0.13Homozygote n = 721.0 ± 3.224.2bp < 0.01. ± 1.84.0 ± 0.22.43ap < 0.05. ± 0.135.36ap < 0.05. ± 0.23Four independent experiments were performed over 23, 4, 29, and 28 days.

Skeletal muscles of transgenic mice showed a reduced weight, which is illustrated by the significant decrease in the relative mass of the total leg (Table I). The normalized weights of the plantaris and gastrocnemius, two fast twitch skeletal muscles, from both MCK-UCP1 lines were markedly lower than those from control mice, whereas the relative mass of the soleus, a slow twitch skeletal muscle, and heart remained unchanged (Table III). The changes in myofiber size were examined in skeletal muscle. No significant alteration in the mean fiber cross-sectional area of fiber types I, IIa, or IIx/IIb was shown in soleus muscle as a result of transgenesis. In contrast, the decrease in absolute and relative weights of fast twitch muscles resulted mainly from a marked decrease in the fiber cross-sectional area of fiber types IIa and IIx/IIb: −27%, p < 0.05 and −41%, p < 0.01, respectively, in plantaris muscle; −40 and −42%,p < 0.01, respectively, in gastrocnemius muscle of homozygotes. In hemizygote mice, the values were very close: −22%,p < 0.05, and −35%, p < 0.01, respectively, in plantaris muscle; −36 and −38%, p< 0.01, respectively, in gastrocnemius muscle. In this experiment and in another independent histological study of muscles, there was no evidence of increased myofiber necrosis and regeneration in transgenic mice (data not shown).Table IIIMuscle relative weightControl n = 5Hemizygote n = 8Homozygote n = 10Plantaris1.26 ± 0.090.82 ± 0.07ap ≤ 0.01.0.69bp ≤ 0.001. ± 0.03Gastrocnemius8.57 ± 0.354.98 ± 0.54bp ≤ 0.001.4.31bp ≤ 0.001. ± 0.42Soleus0.54 ± 0.030.55 ± 0.040.55 ± 0.03Myocard4.67 ± 0.034.69 ± 0.184.95 ± 0.22Mean ± S.E. of the relative weight (mg/g) of several muscles.

In preliminary experiments, we compared the expression and phosphorylation profiles of more than 100 protein kinases and protein phosphatases in human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 between p53+/+ and p53−/− cells in response to short term nocodazole treatment through application of Kinetworks™ immunoblotting screens. Among the proteins tracked, the regulation of the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2 at Thr-183/Tyr-185 was the major difference between p53+/+ and p53−/− cells. With the loss of the p53 gene, the levels of phosphorylation of Ser-63 of c-Jun and Thr-183/Tyr-185 of JNK1/2 in p53−/− cells did not increase as markedly as in p53+/+ cells in response to a 1-h treatment with nocodazole or other microtubule-disrupting drugs such as vinblastine and colchicine. Similar observations were also made in MCF-7 and A549 tumor cells, which were rendered p53-deficient by E6 oncoprotein expression. However, arsenate-induced JNK activation in p53−/− cells was preserved. Inhibition of p53 expression by its antisense oligonucleotide also attenuated nocodazole-induced JNK activation in p53+/+ cells. Surprisingly, cotransfection of p53+/+ cells with dominant negative mutants of JNK isoforms and treatment of p53+/+ cells with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 actually further enhanced apoptosis in p53+/+ cells by up to 2-fold in response to nocodazole. These findings indicate that inhibition of p53-mediated JNK1/2 activity in certain tumor cells could serve to enhance the apoptosis-inducing actions of cancer chemotherapeutic agents that disrupt mitotic spindle function.

Given the pivotal roles of microtubules in numerous biological processes such as mitotic spindle formation, treatment of cells with nocodazole and other microtubule-interfering agents evokes the activation of stress response pathways, cell cycle arrest, and the induction of apoptosis. This accounts for the extensive use of microtubule-interfering agents in tumor chemotherapy. In recent years, a great deal of effort has been devoted to elucidating the signaling pathways that mediate the biological activities of microtubule-interfering agents (1Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a short lived transcription factor that serves as a key player in the cellular response to a variety of extra- and intracellular insults, such as DNA damage, oncogenic activation, and microtubule disruption (2Meek D.W. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 3Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar).

Similar to other stresses, microtubule disruption results in an increase of p53 phosphorylation at multiple sites in a drug- and cell-specific manner, with resultant accumulation of transcriptionally active protein (6Sablina A.A.

Recently, we have demonstrated that nocodazole-induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-392, one of its key activating sites, is mediated through direct p38 MAP kinase stimulation of casein kinase 2 (CK2) in the HeLa cervical and HCT116 colon carcinoma cell lines (8Sayed M.

To explore downstream p53-dependent regulation of signaling proteins in the early response of cells to nocodazole treatment, we applied three of our Kinetworks™ screens to track quantitatively the expressions of 75 protein kinases and 25 protein phosphatases and the states of 31 known phosphorylation sites in these and other phosphoproteins. This was accomplished by comparing the expression and phosphorylation profiles of these proteins in a human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 p53+/+ and its derivative HCT116 p53−/−, where the p53 gene was disrupted through homologous recombination (10Waldman T.

Among the known phosphoproteins tracked, the p53-dependent increase in the phosphorylation and activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was the only significant difference between p53+/+ and p53−/− cells. Even though JNK is well known to play an important role in coordinating the cellular response to stress by phosphorylating the transcription factors c-Jun and p53 (12Hu M.C.T. Qiu W.R. Wang Y.P.

Human breast carcinoma MCF-7 and MCF-7 p53-deficient derivative, and human lung carcinoma A549 and A549 p53-deficient derivative were from Dr. Michel Roberge (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Both MCF-7 and A549 p53-deficient cell lines are derived from E6 oncogene overexpression. Cells were maintained in monolayer culture in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Anti-JNK1, p53, MEK4, MKP1, MKP2, β-actin, and horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-[Thr-183, Tyr-185]JNK polyclonal antibody was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The phospho-[Ser-63]c-Jun antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). GST-c-Jun(1–79)-agarose conjugate was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, BC, Canada). GST-JNK2 agarose conjugate was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Nocodazole, vinblastine, colchicine, taxol, and sodium arsenate were purchased from Sigma. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 was from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Bristol, UK). Other reagents were all from commercial sources, unless otherwise stated. Fluorescein-labeled phosphorothioate p53 antisense (5′-CCCTGCTCCCCCCTGGCTCC-3′) and control nonsense (5′-CGGTGATCTCCAGAGTATGC-3′) oligonucleotides were synthesized by the NAPS unit of University of British Columbia on a 349 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The antisense oligonucleotide is complementary to nucleotides 1071–1090 of exon 10 of the p53 gene, which is located in the C-terminal region that is required for oligomerization of p53 (14Hirota Y. Horiuchi T. Akahane K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1996; 87: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were purified twice by ethanol precipitation. Cells were transfected with oligonucleotides at the concentrations indicated using Lipofectin transfection reagent from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pcDNA3-HA-MEK4(AL) dominant negative mutant plasmid was provided by Dr. Jim Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, ON, Canada), and pLNCX vectors containing wild-type and dominant negative mutants (APF) of JNKs, HAp40JNK1α, β, HAp40JNK2α, β, were gifts from Dr. Lynn Heasley (University of Colorado, Denver) (15Butterfield L. Storey B. Maas L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10110-10116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transfections of HCT116 cells with these constructs were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). For flow cytometry analyses of DNA staining profile, transfected or nontransfected cells in 100-mm dishes at ∼60–80% confluence were treated with 200 ng/ml nocodazole. At various times as indicated under “Results,” the cells were harvested by trypsin treatment, combined with floating cells in the medium, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in methanol for 30 min at −20 °C. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 25 μg/ml RNase A and 25 μg/ml propidium iodine at 37 °C for 30 min. The DNA fluorescence was measured using a BD Biosciences FACScan; data acquisition and analysis were performed with the Cell Quest software. DNA fragmentation assays were performed as described by Huang et al. (16Huang C. Zhang Z. Ding M., Li, J., Ye, J. Leonard S. Shen H.-M. Butterworth L., Lu, Y. Costa M. Rojanasakul Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32516-32522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates were prepared as described previously (17Zhang H. Shi X. Hampong M. Blanis L. Pelech S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6905-6908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in lysis buffer (20 mmTris, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, sonicated for 15 s. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE (13% gel), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with various primary antibodies followed by relevant horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were developed with ECL Plus reagent (AmershamBiosciences), and signals were then captured by Fluor-S MultiImager and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For the preparation of cytosolic and particulate fractions for Kinetworks™ analyses, cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in the above lysis buffer without NaCl and Nonidet P-40. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected as a cytosolic fraction. The pellet fraction was then rehomogenized in lysis buffer with NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After ultracentrifugation, the detergent-solubilized supernatant was saved as a particulate fraction. Kinetworks™ analyses were performed on 300–600 μg of protein/sample. The Kinetworks™ analyses carried out included KPKS 1.0 for 75 protein kinases, KPPS 1.1 for 25 protein phosphatases, and KPSS 1.0 for 33 phosphoproteins. The immunoblotting analyses involved probing with mixes of in-house validated primary antibodies from commercial sources and the application of each mix into a separate lane of a 20-lane multiblotter (Immunetics). Detailed protocols for the Kinetworks™ analyses can be found at the Kinexus Bioinformatics website (www.kinexus.ca). For JNK kinase assay, endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate using anti-JNK1 antibody. In vitro JNK kinase assay was performed as described (19Potapova O. Gorospe M. Dougherty R.H. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1713-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The JNK activity was assayed by phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun(1–79), as revealed by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-[Ser-63]c-Jun antibody. MEK4 kinase activity was assayed similarly except using GST-JNK2 as substrate, instead of GST-c-Jun, whose phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting with anti-phospho-[Thr-183,Tyr-185]JNK antibody. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between p53 status and sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (20Wu G.S. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Bae I. Myers T.G. Fan S. Mutoh M. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Sausville E.A. Weinstein J.N. Friend S.

J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The difference in drug response between tumors with wild-type p53 and those harboring p53 loss-of-function mutations can be explained in part by p53-mediated apoptosis (23Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Treatment of HCT116 cells with 200 ng/ml nocodazole induced a much stronger apoptotic response in p53+/+ cells than in p53−/− cells. As shown in Fig.1, endonucleolytic cleavage of genomic DNA, an indicator of apoptosis, was much more evident in p53+/+ than in p53−/− cells at 72 h (Fig. 1 A). Consistent with this, flow cytometry revealed that most cells from both cell lines were arrested at G2/M transition (4 n DNA) after a 72-h nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1, C and D). However, most of these cells were in G1 phase (2 n DNA) when cultured in the absence of this microtubule disrupter (Fig.1 B). About 30% of cells contained less than 2 n DNA content (sub-G1) characteristic of apoptotic cells in p53+/+ cells (Fig. 1 C) compared with less than 13% in p53−/− cells 72 h after nocodazole treatment (Fig.1 D). To examine the signaling pathways downstream of p53 which might account for the difference in apoptosis induction, we undertook an unbiased proteomics-based approach to focus on signaling proteins that may be important in mediating the actions of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in response to nocodazole. In preliminary studies, we applied three Kinetworks™ screens to analyze the expression profiles of up to 75 protein kinases and 25 protein phosphatases, as well as the phosphorylation states of 25 of these protein kinases (TableI) and 10 other known phosphoproteins (data not shown) from p53+/+ and p53−/− cells treated with 200 ng/ml nocodazole for 1 h. 48 distinct protein kinases isoforms were clearly evident in the HCT116 cell lines (listed in Table I), and weaker signals were recorded for 14 other protein kinases (calmodulin-dependent kinase 1, calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase, casein kinase 1ε, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, cyclin-dependent kinases 2, 6, and 9, death-associated kinase 1, JAK2, Lyn, MST1, protein kinase Cδ, RhoA kinase, and Syk; data not shown) of 75 kinases that can be detected by the Kinetworks™ KPKS 1.0 screen. Of these 48 kinases, 18 protein kinases revealed expression differences of 49% or greater between the untreated p53+/+ and p53−/− cell lines when either the cytosolic or particulate fractions of these cells were investigated separately. In particular, loss of p53 function was associated with increases in cytosolic CK2, ERK6, MEK6, MEK7, Pim1, and RafB; increases in particulate MEK1, MEK2, MEK6, Pim1, PKC-ζ, RafB, and S6 kinase; decreases in cytosolic CDK1, PKC-β1, Rsk1 and Yes; and reductions in particulate Hpk1, MosI and p40 JNK (SAPK-β). 2JNK1 and JNK2 have been reported previously to have at least four different isoforms, p46α, p46β, p54α, and p54β, because of alternative splicing (34Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 35Kallunki T., Su, B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M.

From our study we believe that p54 JNK corresponds to p47 JNK, and p46 JNK corresponds to p40 JNK. The difference in the apparent molecular masses may result from different electrophoresis conditions used in the Kinetworks™ analysis. The 3.8-fold or greater increased productions of Pim1 and MEK6 in the p53−/− cells were the most striking. These findings indicated extensive alterations in protein kinase regulation as a function of p53 status. There were also marked differences in the responses of the p53+/+ and p53−/− cells to a 1-h exposure to nocodazole. In the p53+/+ cells, nocodazole led to 1.5–1.7-fold increases in cytosolic CK2 and Csk, and particulate MEK7, and it was associated with 53–74% reductions in the levels of cytosolic PKC-β1 and particulate ERK2, ERK3, and Yes (the Yes change is not likely to be significant because of low signal:noise ratio). In the p53−/− cells, the nocodazole treatment caused 1.5–3-fold increases in cytosolic Csk, CDK1, CDK7, GCK, PKA, PKC-β1, Rsk1, Yes, ZAP70, and ZIP kinase, and particulate ERK1, PKC-ε, and p40 JNK; and 57–100% reductions in cytosolic Pim1, and particulate Csk1 and Fyn. MosI expression was elevated 5-fold in the particulate fraction of nocodazole-treated p53−/− cells but unaffected in the p53+/+ cells. Of 25 different protein phosphatases that could be potentially detected with the Kinetworks™ KPPS 1.1 screen, 15 were clearly detected in the HCT116 cell lines (Table I), and 5 others were weakly detected (i.e. LAR, MKP1, MKP3, protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit and protein phosphatase X A′2 subunit; data not shown). In the p53−/− cells compared with the p53+/+ cells, there were 1.5–2-fold elevated protein levels of particulate PTP-1B and cytosolic protein phosphatase 1γ catalytic subunit, PTP-PEST, and PTP-1C, and 48–83% reductions in the expressions of particulate MKP2, P5/PPT, and protein phosphatase 1α catalytic subunit. The elevation of cytosolic PTP-1C and reduction of particulate PTP-1C in the p53−/− cells may reflect translocation of this protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Nocodazole caused 2.1–2.5-fold increases in the cytosolic levels of protein phosphatase V catalytic subunit in both the p53−/− and p53+/+ cells, and this might also arise from redistribution of this phosphatase away from the particulate fraction in at least the p53−/− cells. However, nocodazole treatment also had differential effects on other protein phosphatases in the two HCT116 cell lines. It selectively evoked a 2.7-fold increase in cytosolic KAP and 4-fold more particulate MKP2 in p53−/− cells, and 1.8–2.5-fold increased expressions of particulate KAP, protein phosphatase 1Cγ and PTP-1B in p53+/+ cells. The extensive p53-dependent changes in the levels of the protein kinases and protein phosphatases in the HCT116 cells were also accompanied by many altered states of phosphorylation of protein kinases as detected with phosphorylation site-specific antibodies employed in the Kinetworks™ KPSS 1.1 screen (Fig.2 and Table I). 19 distinct phosphorylation sites in 17 different protein kinases were observed to undergo phosphorylation, and 12 of these kinases demonstrated at least 50% increases or decreases in their phosphorylation signals between the p53+/+ and p53−/− cell lines in the absence of nocodazole treatment. After exposure to nocodazole, there were also p53-dependent changes in phosphorylation states of 11 protein kinases which exceeded 50%. In several cases, the altered states of phosphorylation reflected at least in part changes in the protein levels of the various protein kinases. This was observed for the CDK1 inhibitory Tyr-14, ERK2-activating Thr-185/Tyr-187, GSK3β-activating Tyr-216, PKB-α- activating Ser-473, Raf1 p72 Ser-259, Rsk1-activating Thr-360/Ser-364, and Src inhibitory Tyr-529 phosphorylation changes. The “specific phosphorylation” of a protein takes into account the magnitude of the phosphorylation signal relative to the amount of that protein in a sample. Therefore, the specific phosphorylations of the aforementioned protein kinases were not affected markedly by the p53 status or by nocodazole treatment. However, there were cases where loss of p53 function was associated with increased specific phosphorylation of protein kinases, and although the specific phosphorylation of these kinases could be stimulated further by nocodazole in the p53+/+ cells, this was not evident in the p53−/− cells. For example, the specific phosphorylation of cytosolic MEK1/MEK2-activating Ser-217/Ser221 was enhanced in untreated p53−/− cells compared with p53 +/+ cells (percent change in phosphorylation state versus percent change in protein level: 384/79 = 4.9-fold), 3The -fold change in specific phosphorylation of each protein = (100 + % change in phosphorylation state)/(100 + % change in total protein level). and after nocodazole exposure it was increased (265/103 = 2.6-fold) in p53+/+ cells, but not further (122/138 = 0.9-fold) in p53−/− cells. Likewise, the specific phosphorylation of cytosolic PKC-β1 Thr-638/Ser-657 (128/38 = 3.4-fold) and Thr-641 (149/38 = 3.9-fold) were increased in untreated p53−/− cells compared with p53+/+ cells. After nocodazole treatment, these specific phosphorylations of cytosolic PKC β-1 were reduced in p53−/− cells (Thr-638/Ser-657 (66/188 = 0.35-fold) and Thr-641 (69/188 = 0.37-fold)) but were enhanced in p53+/+ cells (Thr-638/Ser-657 (111/47 = 2.4-fold) and Thr-641 (91/47 = 1.9-fold)). By contrast, there was a complete loss of detectable Ser-259 specific phosphorylation of both cytosolic and particulate p62 Raf1 in untreated p53−/− cells compared with p53+/+ cells. Of greatest interest from the Kinetworks™ analyses was the p53-dependent differential regulation of p40 JNK and p47 JNK phosphorylation at their activation sites. In the untreated p53−/− cells compared with p53+/+ cells, there were marked reductions of the specific phosphorylations of cytosolic p40 JNK (56/111 = 0.5-fold), particulate p40 JNK (1/51 = 0.02-fold), and cytosolic p47 JNK phosphorylation (1/109 = 0.01-fold). Although nocodazole treatment evoked clear stimulations of the specific phosphorylations of cytosolic (247/116 = 2.1-fold) and particulate (336/90 = 3.7-fold) p40 JNK, and cytosolic (258/100 = 2.6-fold) and particulate (134/100 = 1.3-fold) p47 JNK in p53+/+ cells, no increases in JNK specific phosphorylation occurred after exposure of the p53−/− cells to nocodazole. These p53 loss of function-associated reductions in basal phosphorylation of JNK along with the abrogation of nocodazole-induced phosphorylation at these activating sites, revealed that JNK acts downstream of p53 in a signaling cascade in the HCT116 p53+/+ cells. The remainder of this study focuses on confirming this finding and establishing its physiological significance. To confirm the results of the Kinetworks™ analysis with respect to JNK regulation in the two HCT116 cell lines in response to nocodazole, we monitored p40 JNK protein and phosphorylation levels by Western blot analysis. Maximum phosphorylation of p40 JNK was induced with 200 ng/ml nocodazole in the p53+/+ cells in 1 h (Fig. 3,A and C). By contrast, there was a slightly higher level of expression of p40 JNK in the p53−/− cells even before nocodazole treatment. However, the protein level of p40 JNK remained relatively constant during the course of treatment (Fig.3 B). These findings further indicate a marked loss in the ability of this microtubule-interfering agent to activate p40 JNK in p53−/− cells. In correlation with the higher levels of immunoreactive phosphorylated JNK, the JNK immunoprecipitated from p53+/+ cells treated with nocodazole exhibited much higher phosphotransferase activity toward GST-c-Jun when assayed in vitro compared with p53−/− counterparts (Fig. 3 D). Therefore, the difference observed after nocodazole treatment in these two cell lines in p40 JNK phosphorylation was caused by the differential activation of the kinase. To examine further the dependence of nocodazole-induced JNK activation on p53 status, we investigated the effect of nocodazole on JNK activity in p53-deficient derivatives of two other cell lines, MCF-7 and A549, in which p53 function was abrogated through expression of viral E6 oncoprotein. Although MCF-7 p53-deficient cells displayed a much higher level of p40 JNK protein expression, MCF-7 parental cells exhibited a marked increase of phosphorylated p40 JNK compared with their p53-deficient counterparts in response to nocodazole treatment (Fig. 3, E andF). Similarly, a higher degree of JNK phosphorylation was observed in A549 parental cells upon nocodazole treatment than in A549 p53-deficient cells, although they exhibited similar JNK protein expression levels (Fig. 3, G and H). Therefore, it is evident that the p53-dependent JNK activation upon nocodazole treatment is not limited to HCT116 cells. However, because of the possible complication of other activities of E6 oncoprotein, we chose to focus subsequent work on the HCT116 cells. Furthermore, to ascertain whether the p53-dependent JNK activation was a general response to microtubule interference, we examined the effects of other microtubule-interfering agents including vinblastine, colchicine, and taxol on JNK activity in HCT116 cells. The higher degree of JNK phosphorylation in HCT116 p53+/+ cells was observed after treatment with microtubule-depolymerizing drugs, vinblastine and colchicine (Fig. 4,A–D), but not with microtubule-stabilizing drug, taxol (data not shown), indicating that the p53-dependent JNK activation might be related to the microtubule-depolymerizing activity of nocodazole, vinblastine, and colchicine. It was conceivable that the lack of significant activation of p40 JNK in p53−/− cells upon nocodazole treatment may result from defects in the JNK signaling pathway in p53−/− cells. To examine this possibility, we used sodium arsenate, a potent activator of stress response pathways involving p38 MAP kinase and JNK, to treat HCT116 cells. Treatment with 0.5 mm sodium arsenate for 0.5 h increased the phospho- p40 JNK levels in p53−/− cells, equivalent to, if not better than tha"
https://openalex.org/W2119723915,"We carried out in vitro phosphorylation assays to determine whether ROMK1 is a substrate of protein kinase C (PKC) and used the two-electrode voltage clamp method to investigate the role of serine residues 4, 183, and 201, the three putative PKC phosphorylation sites, in the regulation of ROMK1 channel activity. Incubation of the purified His-tagged ROMK1 protein with PKC and radiolabeled ATP resulted in (32)P incorporation into ROMK1 detected by autoradiography. Moreover, the in vitro phosphorylation study of three synthesized peptides corresponding to amino acids 1-16, 174-189, and 196-211 of ROMK1 revealed that serine residues 4 and 201 of ROMK1 were the two main PKC phosphorylation sites. In contrast, (32)P incorporation of peptide 174-189 was absent. In vitro phosphorylation studies with ROMK1 mutants, R1S4/201A, R1S4/183A, and R1S183/201A, demonstrated that the phosphorylation levels of R1S4/201A were significantly lower than those of the other two mutants. Also, the Ba(2+)-sensitive K(+) current in oocytes injected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-R1S4/201A was only 5% of that in oocytes injected with wild type GFP-ROMK1. In contrast, the K(+) current in oocytes injected with GFP-ROMK1 mutants containing either serine residue 4 or 201 was similar to those injected with wild type ROMK1. Confocal microscope imaging shows that the surface expression of the K(+) channels was significantly diminished in oocytes injected with R1S4/201A and completely absent in oocytes injected with R1S4/183/201A. Furthermore, the biotin labeling technique confirmed that the membrane fraction of ROMK channels was almost absent in HEK293 cells transfected with either R1S4/201A or R1S4/183/201A. However, when serine residues 4 and 201 were mutated to aspartate, the K(+) currents and the surface expression were completely restored. Finally, addition of calphostin C in the incubation medium significantly decreased the K(+) current in comparison with that under control conditions. Biotin labeling technique further indicated that inhibition of PKC decreases the surface ROMK1 expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells transfected with ROMK1. We conclude that ROMK1 is a substrate of PKC and that serine residues 4 and 201 are the two main PKC phosphorylation sites that are essential for the expression of ROMK1 in the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2023416426,"Copper is an essential co-factor for several key metabolic processes. This requirement in humans is underscored by Menkes disease, an X-linked copper deficiency disorder caused by mutations in the copper transporting P-type ATPase, MNK. MNK is located in the trans-Golgi network where it transports copper to secreted cuproenzymes. Increases in copper concentration stimulate the trafficking of MNK to the plasma membrane where it effluxes copper. In this study, a Menkes disease mutation, G1019D, located in the large cytoplasmic loop of MNK, was characterized in transfected cultured cells. In copper-limiting conditions the G1019D mutant protein was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, this mislocalization was corrected by the addition of copper to cells via a process that was dependent upon the copper binding sites at the N-terminal region of MNK. Reduced growth temperature and the chemical chaperone, glycerol, were found to correct the mislocalization of the G1019D mutant, suggesting this mutation interferes with protein folding in the secretory pathway. These findings identify G1019D as the first conditional mutation associated with Menkes disease and demonstrate correction of the mislocalized protein by copper supplementation.

Copper is essential for the growth and development of all organisms. Several key metabolic processes are copper-dependent, including oxidative respiration, neurotransmitter synthesis, connective tissue formation, free radical detoxification, iron homeostasis, and pigmentation (1Linder M.C.

Menkes disease is characterized by reduced copper transport from intestinal enterocytes into the bloodstream. This reduced supply of dietary copper is further compounded by reduced copper transport across the blood-brain barrier to the central nervous system. Consequently, Menkes patients exhibit a range of symptoms attributable to deficiencies in copper-dependent metabolism, including connective tissue defects, neurological degeneration, mental retardation, seizures, osteoporosis, and hypopigmentation (2Kaler S.G.

Elevated copper concentrations stimulate the trafficking of MNK to the plasma membrane where it is involved in copper efflux (6Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A.

The copper efflux function of MNK is likely to be essential for supplying the blood with dietary copper, as well as the central nervous system. Menkes patients are treated by parenteral copper injections, which in the most successful cases reduces neurological defects and prolongs life expectancy (2Kaler S.G. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 1029S-1034SCrossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, responses to treatment are variable and likely to depend on the age at which treatment commences, and the extent to which mutations impair copper transport or trafficking functions of the Menkes protein. Indeed, the more positive outcomes are thought to involve patients whose mutations permit the expression of some functional MNK protein (10Kaler S.G. Das S. Levinson B. Goldstein D.S. Holmes C.S. Patronas N.J. Packman S. Gahl W.A. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1996; 57: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we characterize the effect of a Menkes disease missense mutation, G1019D, on the intracellular location and trafficking of MNK. The G1019D mutation was found to impair normal secretion and maturation of MNK in the early secretory pathway. Surprisingly, these defects were exacerbated by copper depletion of the growth media and corrected by copper supplementation. This copper-dependent rescue of mislocalized G1019D mutant protein occurred in a dose-dependent and metal-specific manner and was dependent on the N-terminal copper binding sites. Conditions such as reduced temperature or glycerol supplementation, which are known to correct misfolding of other membrane proteins, also prevented mislocalization of the G1019D mutant protein. Our study reports the first conditional Menkes disease mutation that affects secretion and maturation of the transporter and demonstrates correction of this defect by copper supplementation. These observations provide new insights into understanding how parenteral copper treatment of Menkes patients, whose mutations affect protein folding, may yield positive outcomes. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The immortalized Menkes fibroblast cell line, Me32a, was used to generate cell lines expressing wild type MNK (WtMNK) and the G1019D mutant. Me32a cells lack detectable MNK protein due to a frameshift mutation, as described previously (11La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Camakaris J. Engelzou A. Theophilos M.B. Petris M.J. Lockhart P.

Cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. In some experiments, copper chloride or the copper chelator, bathocuproine disulfonic acid was added to the culture medium, as indicated in the figure legends. In some experiments various concentrations of tunicamycin or 10% glycerol were added to the growth media for 16 h. The Transformer mutagenesis kit (Clontech) was used to engineer the G1019D mutation into an EcoRV subclone of the MNK cDNA and verified by DNA sequencing. This mutant EcoRV fragment was then cloned into the MNK cDNA expression plasmid (12Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2107-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) by replacing the corresponding wild type fragment. The G1019D mutant fragment was also cloned into the previously generated construct in which all six Cys-X-X-Cys copper binding sites in the N-terminal region were mutated to Ser-X-X-Ser (13Strausak D., La Fontaine S.

Plasmid constructs bearing the wild type MNK or the G1019D mutant cDNAs were transfected into Me32a cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), and G418 selection was used to isolate stably expressing cell lines, as previously described (14Petris M.J.

In the experiments shown below in Figs. 6 and 7, Me32a cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000.Figure 7The six N-terminal copper binding sites are essential for the copper-dependent glycosylation of G1019D. Me32a cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids containing cDNAs for WtMNK, G1019D, mMBS1–6, and mMBS1–6/G1019D and cultured for 48 h in media containing 500 μm BCS (+ BCS) or media supplemented with 100 μm copper (+Cu). Cell lysates were separated using SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-MNK antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Tubulin protein levels were detected in parallel to indicate protein loading (lower panel).

Genet. 1998; 7: 2063-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), using affinity-purified MNK antibodies or anti-PDI antibodies (Stressgen Biotech), and detected using Alexa594 anti-sheep or Alexa488 anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Protein lysates were prepared as previously described and fractionated using either 6% SDS-PAGE for MNK immunoblots or 8% SDS-PAGE for all other immunoblots (8Petris M.J. Strausak D. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2845-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting experiments were performed using either anti-MNK antibodies or anti-tubulin antibodies (Sigma), as indicated in the figure legends using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The G1019D mutation was previously identified in a patient with classic Menkes disease (15Tümer Z. Lund C. Tolshave J. Vural B. Tonnesen T. Horn N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar). Glycine 1019 is located in the largest cytoplasmic loop of the ATPase, near the aspartic acid 1044 that is the conserved phosphorylation site of all P-type ATPases (Fig.1 A). Although there has been no specific role assigned to G1019, the non-conservative replacement of a small neutral glycine with a large charged residue such as aspartic acid, was predicted to reduce copper transport activity (15Tümer Z. Lund C. Tolshave J. Vural B. Tonnesen T. Horn N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a previous study of the recombinant G1019D MNK protein in the yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, demonstrated that this mutation severely reduced but did not eliminate copper transport, as determined by a complementation growth assay (16Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the consequences of the G1019D mutation on the cell biology of the MNK copper transporter. In vitro mutagenesis was used to generate the G1019D mutation in a plasmid bearing the MNK cDNA. Both wild type MNK (WtMNK) and the G1019D mutant protein were stably expressed in the immortalized fibroblast cell line, Me32a. This cell line was derived from a Menkes patient and does not express endogenous MNK protein (11La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Camakaris J. Engelzou A. Theophilos M.B. Petris M.J. Lockhart P. Greenough M. Brooks H. Reddel R.R. Mercer J.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31375-31380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Three cell lines expressing the G1019D protein were isolated by selection in G418 and used for immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting experiments. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the WtMNK protein was located in the perinuclear region of cells (Fig. 1 B), consistent with its location in the TGN (6Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 7Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). There was no signal detected in Me32a cells stably transfected with the empty vector (data not shown). Although the G1019D protein appeared concentrated in the perinuclear region (Fig.1 B, arrowhead), there was also staining associated with reticular structures extending into cytoplasmic regions. This same distribution was observed in three independent G1019D cell lines (data not shown). This distribution suggested partial location of G1019D protein in both the perinuclear Golgi complex and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Immunoblotting analysis detected the expected 180-kDa MNK protein in cells expressing the WtMNK protein (Fig. 1 B). However, the G1019D protein was resolved as two bands that corresponded to the wild type size, and a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 175 kDa (Fig. 1 B). MNK has been previously shown to be a glycosylated protein (7Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The existence of this lower G1019D band, together with the immunofluorescence data suggesting partial localization in the ER, indicated that the G1019D mutation may impair the glycosylation of MNK resulting in this faster migrating species. To explore this further, we treated cells with the glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin. This resulted in the generation of the faster migrating non-glycosylated form of the WtMNK protein, which was similar to the lower form of the G1019D protein in untreated cells. Significantly, the G1019D protein was more sensitive to tunicamycin treatment compared with wild type MNK and caused G1019D to migrate as a single lower band. These data suggest that the double band of G1019D protein in untreated cells arises from incomplete or defective glycosylation and were consistent with the immunofluorescence data suggesting partial retention of the G1019D protein in the ER. We characterized the G1019D mutant protein further by exploring whether varying the copper availability affected the localization of the protein. To mimic the copper deficiency that occurs in various tissues of Menkes disease patients, we limited the copper availability by culturing the cell lines in the presence of the copper chelator, bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS). Copper depletion had no apparent effect on the WtMNK protein, which appeared perinuclear in both untreated (Fig. 2 A) and BCS-treated cells (Fig. 2 C). As seen earlier in Fig. 1, in untreated G1019D-expressing cells, G1019D protein was observed in the perinuclear region as well as a diffuse reticular distribution (Fig.2 B). Surprisingly, BCS treatment caused a striking change in the location of the G1019D protein to a predominant reticular distribution, with a notable absence of perinuclear signal (Fig.2 D). This BCS effect on the location of G1019D was due to copper depletion, because it was not observed when BCS was added in combination with copper (Fig. 2 F). Indeed, the addition of BCS and copper had the opposite effect by shifting the G1019D protein to a predominantly perinuclear location (Fig. 2 F). This localization was indistinguishable from the location of the WtMNK protein, which remained perinuclear in cells treated either with BCS alone or BCS plus copper (Fig. 2, C and E). We further increased the media copper levels to an excess concentration of 100 μm Cu, which is known to bring about copper-induced trafficking of MNK to the plasma membrane, as shown for the WtMNK protein (Fig. 2 G). Notably, the G1019D mutant protein also relocalized to the plasma membrane in copper-treated cells (Fig.2 H), suggesting the G1019D mutation did not inhibit copper-induced trafficking from the TGN. The effect of copper depletion on the G1019D protein was further explored by testing whether the BCS-induced changes in subcellular location were also accompanied by changes in its electrophoretic mobility. In untreated cells, the G1019D protein appeared as the double band (Fig. 3 A, lane 1), however, in BCS-treated cells, the lower band was the predominant form of G1019D and there was a marked diminution of the normal sized upper band (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). Significantly, the combined addition of BCS and copper to G1019D-expressing cells reversed the BCS effect by causing a marked increase in levels of the upper band with a concomitant decrease in levels of the lower band (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). None of the treatments affected the mobility of the WtMNK protein (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–6). These observations, together with the immunofluorescence data in Fig. 2, suggested that copper limitation reduces secretion and glycosylation of the G1019D mutant protein in early secretory compartments, which can be rescued by copper supplementation. We then investigated the concentrations of copper required to increase the levels of the higher molecular weight G1019D product. The shift toward the higher form of the G1019D protein was observed when G1019D-expressing cells were cultured in 5 μm copper (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) and was saturable with 30 μm copper (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). To test metal specificity, we investigated whether exposure of cells to high levels of zinc, silver, or cadmium could enrich levels of the higher form of the G1019D protein (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6–8). The metal concentrations tested were ∼50% of the levels that retarded cell growth (data not shown). None of these heavy metals changed the ratio of upper and lower bands from those observed in untreated G1019D-expressing cells. These data suggest that the copper-dependent maturation of the G1019D protein is dose-dependent and -specific for this metal ion. In Fig. 2 D, a reticular distribution reminiscent of the ER was observed for the G1019D protein when cells were depleted of copper by BCS treatment. However, to more rigorously test this localization, we tested if the BCS-induced distribution of the G1019D protein co-localized with an ER marker, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Fig.4 shows that the reticular localization of the G1019D protein in BCS-treated cells (Fig. 4 D) co-localized with PDI (Fig. 4 E), as indicated by the extensive yellow labeling in the merged image (Fig.4 F). There was no apparent co-localization of the WtMNK and PDI in BCS-treated cells (Fig. 4, A–C). These data indicated that the G1019D mutant was retained in the ER under in copper-limiting conditions. Some disease-causing mutations in other membrane proteins have been shown to cause retention in the ER due to protein misfolding, and some of these misfolded proteins can be corrected by reducing the culturing temperature or by treating cells with the chemical chaperone glycerol (17Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E. Smicun Y. Aron R. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5889-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Therefore, we tested whether glycerol or reduced temperature could prevent the BCS-induced retention of the G1019D protein in the ER (Fig. 5 B). Glycerol could indeed suppress the BCS-induced retention of G1019D protein in the ER, as evident by strong perinuclear staining of G1019D when BCS and 10% glycerol was added to the culture media (Fig. 5 D). The BCS-induced reticular distribution of G1019D was also found to be temperature-sensitive, because it was suppressed by growing cells with BCS at a reduced temperature of 30 °C (Fig. 5 F). None of these treatments altered the perinuclear location of WtMNK (Fig. 5,A, C, and E). These data further support the notion that the G1019D mutation causes temperature-sensitive misfolding of the MNK protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, which can be pharmacologically corrected using copper or glycerol. Our studies indicate that increasing copper availability allows the G1019D protein to migrate through the ER and correctly localize to the TGN. One possible manner by which this occurs is via copper binding to the N-terminal copper binding sites of the mutant G1019D protein, which may stabilize the protein and permit glycosylation and secretion to post-ER compartments. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a G1019D mutant in which all six Cys-X-X-Cys copper binding sites were mutated to Ser-X-X-Ser; refered to asmutant Metal BindingSites, mMBS1–6/G1019D. Me32a cells were transiently transfected with plasmids for WtMNK, G1019D, mMBS1–6 (mutant metal binding sites alone), and mMBS1–6/G1019D and then cultured in either basal medium or elevated copper. The localization of these proteins was then investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy. As expected, WtMNK was perinuclear in untreated cells (Fig.6 A) and dispersed to the plasma membrane in elevated copper conditions (Fig. 6 B). As shown earlier, the G1019D protein was both perinuclear and reticular in untreated cells (Fig. 6 C) and dispersed to the plasma membrane by elevated copper (Fig. 6 D). The mutation of the copper binding sites alone did not affect the normal perinuclear location in untreated cells (Fig. 6 E), however, these sites were essential for copper-induced trafficking to the plasma membrane under elevated copper conditions (Fig. 6 F), as shown in previous studies (13Strausak D., La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Significantly, when all six copper binding sites were mutated in combination with the G1019D mutation, the resulting mMBS1–6/G1019D mutant was completely located in a reticular distribution (Fig. 6 G), and this resembled the ER retention of G1019D in copper-deficient conditions shown earlier (Fig.2 F). It was notable that increasing the copper concentration of the media failed to change the reticular distribution of the mMBS1–6/G1019D mutant (Fig. 6 H). These data suggest that the secretion of the G1019D mutant protein to post-ER compartments requires the N-terminal copper binding sites. We then determined whether the copper binding sites were required for the enrichment of the higher molecular weight G1019D protein in cells exposed to elevated copper. Me32a cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding WtMNK, G1019D, mMBS1–6, or mMBS1–6/G1019D mutants and then exposed for 48 h to either BCS or elevated copper. In BCS-treated cells, both G1019D and mMBS1–6/G1019D proteins were resolved as single bands that were smaller than both the WtMNK and mMBS1–6 proteins (Fig. 7). Significantly, elevated copper treatment of cells rescued the G1019D mutant protein by enriching expression of the correctly sized protein (Fig. 7, lane 6), however, copper treatment did not change the apparent size of the smaller mMBS1–6/G1019D protein (Fig. 7,lane 8). These data, together with the immunofluorescence findings in Fig. 6, suggest that copper binding to the N-terminal copper binding sites is required for proper secretion and glycosylation of the G1019D mutant protein. The G1019D mutant protein was previously shown to have reduced copper transport activity in a complementation assay in the yeast,S. cerevisiae (16Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Here we expand on these previous studies by using a mammalian cell model to explore the effect of this mutation on the cell biology of MNK. The recombinant G1019D protein in cultured cells was partially localized in the ER and the TGN, and this was associated with the existence of two electrophoretic mobilities for the protein. Inhibition of glycosylation using tunicamycin resulted in the appearance of only a single lower G1019D band. This suggested that the faster mobility of the lower G1019D band was the result of defective glycosylation, rather than truncation, degradation, or premature termination of the G1019D protein. Our findings suggest that the mislocalization of the G1019D protein probably contributed to Menkes disease pathology by limiting the transport of dietary copper from enterocytes into circulation and, subsequently, the transport of copper into the appropriate secretory compartments for cuproenzymes. An important finding of our study was that the extent of the mislocalization of the G1019D protein was dependent on copper levels in the cell growth media. Extensive mislocalization in the ER was observed when copper availability was limited by chelation using BCS, and this was associated with the presence of only the lower molecular weight protein. Adding copper in combination with the BCS restored normal perinuclear localization of the G1019D mutant and increased the amount of the normal sized product. This copper-dependent correction was dose-dependent and copper-specific. Collectively, these data suggest that copper limitation impaired glycosylation and secretion of the G1019D mutant protein in early secretory compartments and that these defects could be rescued by copper supplementation. The copper-dependent correction of the G1019D mutant required the N-terminal copper binding sites, because the G1019D mutant in which these sites were mutated was retained in the ER and failed to become glycosylated when exposed to elevated copper. Because mutation of the six copper binding sites alone did not result in ER mislocalization or impaired glycosylation of MNK, these sites are not critical for secretion through the ER per se. Our data suggest that, in the context of a destabilized protein such as G1019D, the binding of copper to these sites may serve to promote a conformation that is able to bypass the ER quality control mechanisms. To date the N-terminal copper binding sites of MNK have been shown to have roles in the acquisition of copper under copper limiting conditions (16Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and in the copper-regulated trafficking of MNK from the TGN (13Strausak D., La Fontaine S. Hill J.

Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our findings provide evidence that these sites are capable of copper binding early in the biosynthesis of MNK and that this process can be essential for secretion and maturation of mutant MNK proteins, such as G1019D. The export of newly synthesized proteins from the ER to the Golgi is regulated by a quality control mechanism that ensures that only properly folded and assembled proteins exit the ER and misfolded proteins are retained and ultimately degraded. Defective processing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein was originally recognized as an important cause of cystic fibrosis (20Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) and has been documented in several proteins involved in other congenital diseases (17Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35947-35952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The most notable of these is Wilson disease, which is caused by mutations in a copper ATPase, WND, that shows a high degree of sequence similarity to MNK and is also is localized in the TGN (25Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Wilson disease is caused by a toxic accumulation of hepatic copper due to defective biliary excretion of copper via the WND ATPase. A common Wilson disease mutation, H1069Q, causes retention of the WND protein in the ER (18Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and ER retention has been subsequently identified for several other Wilson disease mutations (26Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In several diseases involving misfolded proteins, glycerol treatment or reduced temperature facilitates the proper folding and secretion of the affected mutant protein in cultured cells. The Wilson disease H1069Q mutation is corrected by reduced temperature, and, similarly, we found both reduced temperature and glycerol could suppress mislocalization of the G1019D protein under copper-depleted conditions. It is possible that the large cytoplasmic loop of MNK and WND copper ATPases, which contains the respective G1019 and H1069 amino acids, is a region important in the folding and secretion of these transporters. It is notable that this cytoplasmic loop of WND has been recently shown to interact with the N-terminal region in a copper-dependent manner in vitro (27Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our data showing a dependence of the N-terminal copper bindings for the secretion of the G1019D mutant highlights the possibility that such an interaction in WND and MNK proteins may influence the processing and secretion of these copper transporters in vivo. It is notable that certain misfolded proteins, such as the vassopressin receptor, P-glycoprotein, and apolipoprotein A, which are retained in the ER, can be rescued by exposing cells to their respective ligands (28Wang J.

It is thought that the binding of the ligands to these proteins early in the secretory pathway confers a more stable conformation of the mutant proteins, allowing evasion of the ER quality control mechanisms. Moreover, in some diseases, such as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which involves mutations in the vassopressin receptor, the same ligand with protein-stabilizing ability is used to treat patients (29Morello J.P.

The demonstration that copper could correct the mislocalization of the Menkes G1019D mutant is clearly analogous to the ligand-dependent rescue of these other mutant membrane proteins. Moreover, our findings offer novel insights at the molecular level to explain how current treatments for Menkes disease, which involve parenteral administration of copper, may yield positive outcomes in certain individuals whose mutations affect the processing and secretion of MNK. Although we have no specific information on the copper status of the G1019D Menkes patient, there is typically a marked decrease in circulating serum copper levels due to reduced intestinal absorption. A more severe copper deficiency in the brain occurs due to the predicted role of MNK in the transport of copper across the blood-brain barrier. Our findings allow us to speculate that reduced circulating copper levels in the G1019D Menkes patient may have impaired the maturation of the G1019D protein in various tissues, especially in the brain. Moreover, our finding that copper could suppress this mislocalization in cultured cells suggests in principle that a course of treatment involving copper injections may have promoted normal localization of the G1019D protein and sufficient copper transport activity for a positive clinical response. Clearly, future studies with transgenic mice and cultured cells that express various Menkes disease alleles, such as G1019D, will be a useful strategy for understanding the affects of copper treatments on the function of mutant MNK proteins at the cellular and physiological levels.

The binding component (Ib) is required to internalize into cells an enzymatic component (Ia) that ADP-ribosylates G-actin. To characterize the Ia domain that interacts with Ib, fusion proteins were constructed between the C. botulinum C3 enzyme, which ADP-ribosylates Rho, and various truncated versions of Ia. These chimeric molecules retained the wild type ADP-ribosyltransferase activity specific for Rho and were recognized by antibodies against C3 enzyme and Ia. Internalization of each chimera into Vero cells was assessed by measuring the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and intracellular ADP-ribosylation of Rho. Fusion proteins containing C3 linked to the C terminus of Ia were transported most efficiently into cells like wild type Ia in an Ib-dependent manner that was blocked by bafilomycin A1. The minimal Ia fragment that promoted translocation of Ia-C3 chimeras into cells consisted of 128 central residues (129–257). These findings revealed that iota toxin is a suitable system for mediating the entry of heterologous proteins such as C3 into cells.

Iota toxin is one of the major lethal and dermonecrotic toxins ofClostridium perfringens type E and a member of the clostridial binary toxin group, which includes Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, Clostridium difficileADP-ribosyltransferase, and Clostridium spiroforme toxin (1Popoff M.R.

Academic Press, New York1978: 291-332Google Scholar). One domain (A) possesses enzymatic activity, and the other (B) domain is involved in binding to a membrane receptor and translocation of the toxin into a cell. Binary toxins are unique in that the functional domains are localized on separate proteins that are not linked in solution. Iota toxin consists of A (Ia, 47.5 kDa) and B (Ib, 94 kDa) components that undergo limited proteolysis for functional activity (3Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect.

After binding to cell-associated Ib and gaining entry into the cytosol, Ia ADP-ribosylates globular skeletal muscle and non-muscle actin at Arg-177 which subsequently disrupts the actin cytoskeleton (10Vandekerckhove J. Schering B. Bärmann M. Aktories K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 255: 48-52Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 1223-1228PubMed Google Scholar). Ib shares significant sequence identity (33.9%) with the protective antigen (PA) of anthrax toxins, suggesting that the two proteins have similar modes of action (3Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5147-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anthrax toxin is also binary, and PA represents the common receptor-binding component that interacts with the two effecter proteins, edema factor and lethal factor (LF), subsequently mediating their entry into target cells (12Leppla S. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughnan M. Tu A.T. Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease. 8. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 543-572Google Scholar). The clostridial binary and anthrax toxins share a related mechanism of entry into cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, which requires an acidification step for translocation into the cytosol (4Considine R.V.

The activated binding components of anthrax, iota, and C2 toxins (PA, Ib, and C2-II, respectively) recognize via their C terminus a cell surface carbohydrate or glycoprotein (C2-II), or they bind to unique surface proteins (PA or Ib) and then oligomerize (14Barth H.

The whole toxin (binding plus enzymatic components) is transported to the endosome where acidification promotes cytosolic entry of specific enzymatic components (edema factor and/or LF with PA; C2-I with C2-II; Ia with Ib) possibly through channels formed by oligomerized binding components (19Bachmeyer C. Benz R. Barth H. Aktories K. Gibert M. Popoff M.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1658-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, unlike anthrax and C2 toxins, iota toxicity is not blocked by alkalinizing agents such as chloroquine and monensin (16Perelle S. Scalzo S. Kochi S. Mock M. Popoff M.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 146: 117-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bachmeyer C. Benz R. Barth H. Aktories K. Gibert M. Popoff M.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1658-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, Ib can transcytose CaCo-2 cells and then promote Ia entry from the opposite cell surface (20Richard J.F. Mainguy G. Gibert M. Marvaud J.C. Stiles B. Popoff M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ability of bacterial toxins to translocate across cell membranes naturally avails them to be targeted protein delivery systems. Diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A have been widely used to construct protein chimeras as tools for cell biology and therapeutic applications (21Pastan I. Chaudhary V. Fitzgerald D.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Binary toxins represent an attractive model that warrants further development as a transport system because the functional domains are independent and localized on different protein chains. Thus, the N-terminal 300 residues of edema factor and LF share sequence similarities and reportedly contain the domain required for binding to PA (22Bragg T.S. Robertson D.L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 81: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins between the 254 N-terminal residues of LF and the enzymatic domain of exotoxin A, diphtheria toxin, or tetanus toxin light chain are effectively translocated into cells in a PA-dependent manner (23Arora N. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Milne J.C. Blanke S.R. Hanna P.C. Collier J.R. Mol.

Further understanding of functional domains and the translocation mechanisms employed by different toxins will help in designing a general system for delivering proteins into the cytosol of targeted eukaryotic cells. We have shown previously that the catalytic site of Ia is localized within the C terminus (26Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the minimal Ia domain that interacts with Ib by constructing varying sized fusions of Ia with C. botulinum C3 enzyme (23.5 kDa) and subsequently monitoring internalization into Vero cells via the Ib component. The C3 enzyme is an ADP-ribosyltransferase that selectively modifies Rho protein and leads to the loss of actin stress fibers (27Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar,28Chardin P. Boquet P. Madaule P. Popoff M.R. Rubin E.J. Gill D.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). This enzyme does not readily enter cells by itself, thus making it an ideal tool for measuring the biological activity of internalized fusion proteins. In this report, we show that iota toxin efficiently internalizes heterologous proteins, such as the C3 enzyme, into targeted cells. Standard procedures were used for genetic constructions (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the C3-Ia constructions, DNA encoding the C3 mature protein (C31–211) was amplified from the recombinant plasmid pMRP33 (30Popoff M.R. Hauser D. Boquet P. Eklund M.W. Gill D.M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3673-3679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with oligonucleotides generating a NcoI site at the 5′-end and EcoRI site at the 3′-end. The fragment was digested with NcoI and EcoRI and then inserted into pET28b (Novagen) yielding pMRP234. Seven fragments of the Ia gene were amplified by PCR from the recombinant plasmid pMRP67 (3Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5147-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA fragments encoding the C terminus of Ia were amplified from pMRP252, which encodes for Ia mutated at the catalytic ADP-ribosylation site (E380A) (26Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides introduced EcoRI and SalI sites at the intended new 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Amplified fragments were ligated into the SmaI site of pUC18, and all constructs were verified by sequencing via the dideoxy chain termination method (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Fragments cut with EcoRI-SalI were inserted into pMRP234. The different constructs depicted in Fig.1 are designated according to the amino acid numbering for each encoded protein. The C3-Ia proteins were linked by four non-native amino acids (YPEF) as a result of the PCR manipulations. All constructs have a C-terminal extension of 9 residues resulting from the vector polylinker and a hexahistidine tag (Fig.1). For the Ia-C3 constructions, DNA encoding the C3 mature protein (C31–211) was amplified as above with oligonucleotides generating a SalI site at the 5′-end and XhoI site at the 3′-end and was then inserted into pET28a (Novagen) yielding pMRP487. Eight Ia gene fragments were PCR amplified from pMRP252 with oligonucleotides adding an EcoRI site at the 5′-end and aSalI site at the 3′-end and were then cloned individually into pMRP487. The histidine tag and 26 subsequent N-terminal amino acids were derived from the pET28a vector. The Ia and C3 fragments were separated by two residues (Val-Asp) resulting from PCR and cloning manipulations, and the fusion proteins end at the natural stop codon from the C3 gene. Recombinant plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and were then grown at 37 °C in 40 μg/ml LB-kanamycin to an A 600 nm of 0.6–0.8. Recombinant protein production was then induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosylpyranoside, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were disrupted by sonication and clarified by centrifugation. Recombinant protein was primarily recovered in the pellet following extraction with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl buffer (pH 8), containing 6 mguanidine HCl for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged and the supernatant filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane. Recombinant proteins were adsorbed onto a Co2+-charged column (Clontech), eluted with 250 mm imidazole, dialyzed against 50 mmNaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) containing 300 mm NaCl plus 15% glycerol, and finally concentrated by dialysis against Aquacide II (Calbiochem). Proteins were separated by 0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) according to the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. For immunoblotting analysis, proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose (Hybond C, AmershamBiosciences) that was blocked by 5% (w/v) dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated overnight at room temperature with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit antibodies against C3 enzyme (28Chardin P. Boquet P. Madaule P. Popoff M.R. Rubin E.J. Gill D.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) or Ia (3Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect.

Bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase-labeled protein A and chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). The RhoA-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein was produced from pGEX-2T RhoA in E. coli HB101 provided by A. Hall, and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) by standard methods (32Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Chanda V.B., Ed. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Willey and Sons, Seattle1995Google Scholar). MgCl2 (5 mm) was added to all buffers to prevent loss of guanine nucleotides. Recombinant C3 enzyme was produced in large amounts (about 10% of total protein) in E. coli strain Sure (Stratagene) from pMRP143 consisting of the DNA fragment coding for the C3 mature protein (30Popoff M.R. Hauser D. Boquet P. Eklund M.W. Gill D.M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3673-3679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and iota toxin gene promoter in vector pJIR750 (3Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R.

Bacterial cell sonicate in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) was clarified by centrifugation, treated with 2 mg/ml protamine sulfate (Merck) for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged again. The supernatant was loaded onto a QAE-Separose A50 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in Tris buffer. The flow-through containing purified C3 enzyme was concentrated and consisted of one band (25 kDa) after SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. The ADP-ribosylation solution was modified from Miyaoka et al. (33Miyaoka T. Tsuchiya M. Hara N. Ishino H. Shimoyama M. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and consisted of 50 mm triethanolamine HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 0.3 mm GDP, 10 mm thymidine, and 2.5 mm [32P]NAD (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 20,000 dpm/pmol). For in vitro ADP-ribosylation, recombinant C3, Ia, or one of the various chimeric constructs was added at a final concentration of 10−8m to 20 μl of the mixture. Bovine brain extract containing actin and Rho was used as the substrate for iota toxin and C3. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, stopped by adding 7 μl of the sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried for autoradiography. The quantitative assays were performed as described above using 3 μg of purified RhoA-GST or 50 μg of total protein from a soluble Vero cell extract, and serial dilutions of C3 or fusion construct. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min and subsequent SDS-PAGE, radioactive RhoA-GST bands were quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and the IQMac program. For the assays of in vivoADP-ribosylation of Rho, Vero cells were grown on six-well plates until confluent, and then various concentrations of C3 or fusion protein were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of Ib (molar ratio 1:1) for 4 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with ADP-ribosylation buffer containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant (50 μg of total protein) was ADP-ribosylated in vitro in a final volume of 20 μl of ADP-ribosylation buffer containing radiolabeled NAD and 10−7m C3. Vero cells were grown on coverslips at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Various concentrations of either a fusion construct or C3 enzyme with Ib (1:1 molar ratio) were added and incubated for the indicated times. Iota toxin (Ia and Ib at 1:1 molar ratio) was used as a control. The coverslips were washed twice in PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with 1 μg/ml FITC-phalloidin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and mounted in Moviol as described previously (34Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E.

Fluorescence-activated cytometry was done with Ib bound to Vero cells, or control cells without Ib, and fusion protein as described previously (18Stiles B. Hale M.L. Marvaud J.C. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3475-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Marvaud J.C. Smith T. Hale M.L. Popoff M.R. Smith L.A. Stiles B.G. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2435-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were detached from culture flasks by 50 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) lacking Ca2+ and Mg2+. Cells (4–8 × 105/tube) were washed with ice-cold HBSS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated with 3 × 10−8m Ib in HBSS-BSA for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold HBSS-BSA and incubated with a 3 × 10−8m fusion construct in the same buffer for 15 min on ice. After washing with ice-cold HBSS-BSA, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-Ia serum (1:400) for 1 h on ice, washed, and subsequently incubated for 1 h on ice with FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Sigma). After a final wash, cells were fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by FACsort flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). CD experiments were performed on a CD6 spectrodichrograph (Jobin-Yvon Instruments, Longjumeau, France), as described elsewhere (36Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All spectra were recorded at 37 °C in a thermostated cell holder flushed constantly by N2. Measurements were made in 10 mmNaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5). CD spectra were measured in the far-ultraviolet range from 190 to 250 nm in a quartz cell of 1-mm path length. The scans were recorded using a bandwidth of 2 nm and an integration time of 1 s at a scan rate of 0.5 nm·s−1. Each far-ultraviolet spectrum represents the average of 15 scans. The spectra were blank corrected, and a smoothing algorithm was applied with the minimum filter using CD6 software (CDMax, filter 5). The mean residue ellipticity (MRE) in far-UV was calculated using [θ]MRE = (100 × θm)/(C × l × N), where θm is the measured ellipticity in degrees, Cis the molar concentration of the protein, l is the path length of the cell in centimeters, and N represents the number of residues. The values of [θ]MRE are expressed in degrees/cm2/dmol of residue. Fusions between the mature C3 protein and various fragments of Ia were constructed recombinantly to identify the Ia domain that interacts with Ib (Fig. 1). A first set of Ia fragments was fused via the N terminus to C3 (designated as C3-Ia), and contained a C-terminal extension of 9 residues plus a hexahistidine tag encoded by the pET28b vector. A second series of chimeras (designated as Ia-C3) consisted of C3 fused to the C terminus of various sized Ia fragments (Fig. 1). The Ia fragments contained an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a stretch of 26 amino acids encoded by pET28a, the last of which is Phe. These chimeric proteins ended at the stop codon from the wild type C3 gene. Because the enzymatic site of Ia is located within the C terminus, constructs a, d, f, g, h, i, and j were derived from a mutated Ia gene (E380A) coding for an enzymatically inactive form of Ia (26Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The various fusion proteins were produced and then purified on a Co2+ column, yielding homogeneous fusion proteins that migrated according to their expected molecular masses in SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). Western blots confirmed that these molecules reacted with anti-C3 and anti-Ia sera (data not shown). Enzymatic specificity of each fusion protein was checked using bovine brain extract that contains large amounts of actin and other cellular proteins. All protein chimeras, like the C3 control, ADP-ribosylated a 21-kDa protein, whereas only wild type Ia ADP-ribosylated a 45-kDa protein corresponding to cellular actin (Fig.3). This confirmed that the enzymatic activity of the fusion constructs was caused by C3 and not Ia, and there was seemingly no difference in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity between the chimeras and C3 (Fig. 3). However, further analysis by a quantitative ADP-ribosylation assay with purified RhoA-GST indeed revealed that the C3 fusion proteins retained 60–100% of the wild type C3 enzymatic activity as determined from initial reaction rates, except construct h (Ia42–454-C3), which possessed only 40% of the native activity (Fig. 4 and Table I). Overall, these data indicated that Ia fragments fused via the C or N terminus to C3 did not adversely affect the enzymatic activity of C3.Figure 4Quantitative in vitroADP-ribosylation of Rho by C3, C3-Ia (A), or Ia-C3 (B) constructs.

https://openalex.org/W2104497506,"The multidomain bacterial surface protein L (PpL) is a virulence factor expressed by only 10% ofPeptostreptococcus magnus strains, and its expression is correlated with bacterial vaginosis. The molecular basis for its ability to recognize 60% of mammalian immunoglobulin light chain variable regions (VL) has been described recently by x-ray crystallography, which suggested the presence of two VL binding sites on each protein L domain (Graille, M., Stura, E. A., Housden, N. G., Beckingham, J. A., Bottomley, S. P., Beale, D., Taussig, M. J., Sutton, B. J., Gore, M. G., and Charbonnier, J. (2001) Structure9, 679–687). Here, we report the crystal structure at 2.1 Å resolution of a protein L mutant complexed to an Fab′ fragment with only 50% of the VL residues interacting with PpL site 1 conserved. Comparison of the site 1 interface from both structures shows how protein L is able to accommodate these sequence differences and therefore bind to a large repertoire of Ig. The x-ray structure and NMR results confirm the existence of two VL binding sites on a single protein L domain. These sites exhibit a remarkable structural mimicry of growth factors binding to their receptors. This could explain the protein L superantigenic activity on human B lymphocytes.

Gram-positive bacterial proteins that interact with immunoglobulins have been widely studied and utilized in immunology and biotechnology. Among the best known are Staphylococcus aureus protein A (SpA) 1The abbreviations used are: SpA, Staphylococcus aureus protein A; SpG, streptococcal protein G; PpL, Peptostreptococcus magnus protein L; VL, variable light chain region; VH, variable heavy chain region; CL, constant light chain region; CH, constant heavy chain region; Fv, variable fragment; Fc, constant fragment; PpLwt, wild type protein L domain; PpLD55A, protein L domain containing the Asp to Ala substitution at position 55; MPEG 5000, methoxypolyethylene glycol 5000; rmsd, root mean square deviation; TROSY, transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation 1The abbreviations used are: SpA, Staphylococcus aureus protein A; SpG, streptococcal protein G; PpL, Peptostreptococcus magnus protein L; VL, variable light chain region; VH, variable heavy chain region; CL, constant light chain region; CH, constant heavy chain region; Fv, variable fragment; Fc, constant fragment; PpLwt, wild type protein L domain; PpLD55A, protein L domain containing the Asp to Ala substitution at position 55; MPEG 5000, methoxypolyethylene glycol 5000; rmsd, root mean square deviation; TROSY, transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation (1Langone J.J. Adv. Immunol. 1982; 32: 157-252Google Scholar), streptococcal protein G (SpG) (2Bjorck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974Google Scholar), and Peptostreptococcus magnus protein L (PpL) (3Bjorck L. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1194-1197Google Scholar). They contain from two to five successive and highly homologous Ig-binding domains and recognize distinct regions on a wide portion of Ig. Protein L, a surface protein from Peptostreptococcus magnus, is 76–106 kDa in size and contains four to five (depending on the strain) highly homologous consecutive extracellular domains (4Murphy J.P. Duggleby C.J. Atkinson M.A. Trowern A.R. Atkinson T. Goward C.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 911-920Google Scholar, 5Kastern W. Sjobring U. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12820-12825Google Scholar). It binds with high affinity and high specificity to mammalian κ light chain variable (VLκ) regions (6Akerstrom B. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19740-19746Google Scholar, 7Nilson B.H. Solomon A. Bjorck L. Akerstrom B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2234-2239Google Scholar). Although expressed by a minority ofP. magnus strains, PpL appears to be a virulence factor because its presence is correlated with enhanced vaginal colonization (8Ricci S. Medaglini D. Marcotte H. Olsen A. Pozzi G. Bjorck L. Microb. Pathog. 2001; 30: 229-235Google Scholar) and the concomitant occurrence of bacterial vaginosis (9Kastern W. Holst E. Nielsen E. Sjobring U. Bjorck L. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1217-1222Google Scholar). PpL, like SpA and SpG, is an important tool for purification, recognition, and removal of immunoglobulins, but it has a different and unique specificity. SpA and SpG domains recognize a common site at the interface between the CH2 and CH3 domains on the Fc of IgG (Fcγ) (10Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Google Scholar, 11Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Kleywegt G.J. Uhlen M. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 265-278Google Scholar), but they also interact with functionally distinct regions on the Fab portion of particular Ig families or subclasses (SpA does not bind to most IgG3, whereas SpG does) (12Derrick J.P. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 752-754Google Scholar, 13Graille M. Stura E.A. Corper A.L. Sutton B.J. Taussig M.J. Charbonnier J.B. Silverman G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5399-5404Google Scholar). SpG recognizes the Fab portion through binding to the CH1 domain of IgG, whereas SpA interacts with the VH domain on 12% of mouse and 50% of human Fv fragments. Although these two latter interactions have relatively low affinity (K d of 200 nm), they have been used in specific cases for Fab purification and phage library validation. PpL does not share Fc binding ability with SpA and SpG, but its high affinity (K d of 1 nm) for the variable light chain regions of more than two thirds of mouse and ∼50% of human Ig, irrespective of their class, makes it particularly interesting for the purification of Fab fragments and single chain antibodies (scFv). To understand better how PpL can bind a large population of light chains, we recently reported the crystal structure of the complex between a PpL single domain and a human Fab (14Graille M. Stura E.A. Housden N.G. Beckingham J.A. Bottomley S.P. Beale D. Taussig M.J. Sutton B.J. Gore M.G. Charbonnier J. Structure. 2001; 9: 679-687Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in this structure the PpL domain is sandwiched between two antibody light chains in a manner reminiscent of cytokines binding to their receptors at the cell surface (15Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Google Scholar, 16de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar, 17Syed R.S.

Nature. 1998; 395: 511-516Google Scholar). From the two sites identified, only site 1 was already documented (18Wikstrom M. Sjobring U. Drakenberg T. Forsen S. Bjorck L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 128-133Google Scholar, 19Beckingham J.A. Bottomley S.P. Hinton R. Sutton B.J. Gore M.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 193-199Google Scholar, 20Beckingham J.A. Housden N.G. Muir N.M. Bottomley S.P. Gore M.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 395-401Google Scholar). To investigate the functional relevance of site 2, we have designed a PpL mutant (PpL D55A; hereafter PpLD55A) where substitution of Asp-55 by Ala should disrupt a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond that was believed to be crucial for the interaction with PpL site 2. Thus, the PpLD55A mutant should retain only site 1 binding for VL. This mutant was built on the Y64W template, where Trp-64 is an efficient fluorescent probe to measure K d by stopped flow methods (20Beckingham J.A. Housden N.G. Muir N.M. Bottomley S.P. Gore M.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 395-401Google Scholar). Here, we present the complex between the PpLD55A mutant and a mouse Fab′ fragment bearing a VLκ9 region to 2.1Å resolution. The structure shows how PpL is able to accommodate differences in light chain sequences. The PpLD55A mutant indeed shows a single binding mode in the crystal. To confirm the relevance of the second site in solution, we have studied the interaction between VL chains and different PpL domains by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Finally, we compare the residues involved in the first and second interfaces and reveal a strong homology between the two PpL interaction patches. Cloning of the 19D9D6 antibody (IgG1,κ) light chain was performed by standard methodology using classical PCR amplification as described previously (21Bettsworth F. Monnet C. Watelet B. Battail-Poirot N. Gilquin B. Jolivet M. Menez A. Arnaud M. Ducancel F. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 99-109Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the Fd domain of the 19D9D6 antibody was obtained using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method, as described previously (22Ruberti F. Cattaneo A. Bradbury A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 173: 33-39Google Scholar). The PCR products were obtained using the Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) and directly ligated into the pCR®2.1 cloning vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of cloned DNA were determined by sequencing on an ABI 310 automatic sequencer using a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems). The antibody 19D9D6 (IgG1,κ) was produced in vitro and purified as follows (23Jolivet-Reynaud C. Dalbon P. Viola F. Yvon S. Paranhos-Baccala G. Piga N. Bridon L. Trabaud M.A. Battail N. Sibai G. Jolivet M. J. Med. Virol. 1998; 56: 300-309Google Scholar). Briefly, the supernatant was diluted 1:2 (v/v) in a high salt buffer, then loaded on a protein A column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted at pH 6.0, following the manufacturer's instructions. The F(ab′)2 fragment was obtained by proteolytic cleavage of the IgG by pepsin. The purified IgG was mixed with pepsin-agarose in an acidic buffer and digested for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The pepsin-agarose was then removed by centrifugation. The F(ab′)2 fragment was recovered in the supernatant and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The Fab′ fragment was obtained by reduction with β-mercaptoethanol and blockage of the corresponding free cysteine residues with iodoacetamide. The Fab′ was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200. The PpLD55A and PpLD55N mutants were made by mutating residue 55 on the Y64W or wild type template DNA (20Beckingham J.A. Housden N.G. Muir N.M. Bottomley S.P. Gore M.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 395-401Google Scholar) using the antisense primers 5′-TGC TAA TAA AGC TGC ATA TCT-3′ and 5′-TTT TGC TAA TAAGTT TGC ATA TCT GTA-3′, respectively. The sites of the mutations are shown in boldface. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the Sequenase 2.2 DNA sequencing kit (USB Corporation). Proteins were purified as PpLwt as described previously (24Bottomley S.P. Beckingham J.A. Murphy J.P. Atkinson M. Atkinson T. Hinton R.J. Gore M.G. Bioseparation. 1995; 5: 359-367Google Scholar). Proteins labeled with the 15N isotope were prepared by preculturing appropriately transformed Escherichia coli (JM103) in LB liquid media. Cells were harvested and resuspended in M9 minimal media supplemented with NH4Cl (15N), glucose, thiamine, MnCl2, and FeCl3. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) after a 1 h incubation at 37 °C with shaking. Cells were harvested after a further 18-h incubation, whereupon 15N-labeled PpL was purified as described in Ref. 24Bottomley S.P. Beckingham J.A. Murphy J.P. Atkinson M. Atkinson T. Hinton R.J. Gore M.G. Bioseparation. 1995; 5: 359-367Google Scholar. All NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. Solution conditions for PpLwt and PpLD55N were 20 mm deuterated sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 1 mm NaN3 in 95:5% H2O/D2O. PpLwt and PpLD55N concentrations were typically 300 μm,and VLκ1 was added to the solutions to give final solution concentrations of 150 and 300 μmVLκ1 (2:1 and 1:1 PpL·VL). 1H-15N correlation spectra were recorded using the TROSY pulse sequence provided by Lewis Kay, and measuring times were 30 min for control spectra and 4 h for the PpL·VL complexes. The Fab′ 19D9D6·PpLD55Acomplex was prepared in solution before the crystallization trials by mixing 18 μl of Fab′ 19D9D6 (6 mg/ml) with 4 μl of PpLD55A (16 mg/ml). Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at room temperature in sitting drops by mixing 3 volumes of a reservoir solution containing 10% (w/w) MPEG 5000, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, with 4 volumes of the protein solution. Crystals suitable for data collection were enlarged by using streak seeding followed by macroseeding (25Stura E.A. Wilson I.A. J. Cryst. Growth. 1991; 110: 270-282Google Scholar). For data collection, crystals were transferred into a cryo-solution containing 5 μl of ethylene glycol, 3 μl of 50% (w/w) MPEG 5000, and 10 μl of 3 mmZnCl2, 3 mm CdCl2, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 50% (w/w) MPEG 5000. Two data sets were recorded at 100 K from isomorphous crystals to 2.6Å and later to 2.1Å resolution on ID14-EH2 and ID14-EH4 beamlines respectively (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France). Data were processed using the HKL package (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). Crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121.

Open table in a new tab The 25–2.6 Å data set was used to solve the structure by the molecular replacement method with the program AMORE (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar). Using the coordinates from the variable (VL/VH) and constant (CL/CH1) regions of the uncomplexed Fab′ 19D9D6 structure (28Stura E.A. Graille M. Housden N.G. Gore M.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1744-1748Google Scholar) as independent search models, the two Fab′ molecules present in the asymmetric unit were correctly positioned (Table I). Any attempts to position the two PpL molecules were unsuccessful. After an initial refinement of this model, ςA-weighted 2F o − F c andF o − F c electron density maps were analyzed with the program TURBO (29Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar). These maps show electron density corresponding to a single PpL domain in the vicinity of the VL region from both Fab′ molecules. The PpL domains were thus fitted into these maps by superimposing on both Fab′ molecules the previously solved structure of the complex between a human Fab and the PpLwt domain (14Graille M. Stura E.A. Housden N.G. Beckingham J.A. Bottomley S.P. Beale D. Taussig M.J. Sutton B.J. Gore M.G. Charbonnier J. Structure. 2001; 9: 679-687Google Scholar) with the program ALIGN (30Satow Y. Cohen G.H. Padlan E.A. Davies D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 593-604Google Scholar). The two Fab′·PpLD55A complexes present in the asymmetric unit were first refined within the 25–2.7 Å resolution range with non-crystallographic symmetry restraints of 100 kcal/mol/Å2 applied to the whole model with the exception of the domains involved in the interfaces and finally from 20 to 2.1 Å resolution without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. The structure was refined with the program CNS (31Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), and the model was rebuilt in TURBO. Statistics for the structure determination are listed in Table I. The final model contains 994 residues, 733 water molecules, and 2 ethylene glycol molecules from the cryo-solution. Detectable residues range from 20 to 82 for the first PpLD55A domain and from 20 to 81 for the second PpLD55A domain. As observed for all PpL domain structures solved to date (14Graille M. Stura E.A.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 480-487Google Scholar), the 19 N-terminal residues are disordered and thus absent from the final model. With the exception of small loops from the CH1 region and to a lesser extent the complementarity determining region L1, the final model is well defined in the electron density map. All but one residue from each complex display main chain dihedral angles that fall within allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot as defined by the program PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). The only exception is Ala L51 from the L2 hypervariable loop, which has been found to adopt unfavorable conformations in many crystal structures of Fab fragments. The VL conformation is unchanged between the two Fab′ molecules with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.21Å over 430 backbone atoms as calculated by the program ALIGN (30Satow Y. Cohen G.H. Padlan E.A. Davies D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 593-604Google Scholar). Similarly, both PpLD55A domains superimpose well on each other with an rmsd of 0.42Å over 240 backbone atoms with the largest shift found for the loop connecting β-strands 3 and 4, which is less well defined in electron density. The PpLD55A domain assumes the same three-dimensional structure as the PpLwtdomain (14Graille M. Stura E.A. Housden N.G. Beckingham J.A. Bottomley S.P. Beale D. Taussig M.J. Sutton B.J. Gore M.G. Charbonnier J. Structure. 2001; 9: 679-687Google Scholar), and the PpLY64W domain solved to 1.7Å resolution (Y47W according to O'Neill numbering (33O'Neill J.W. Kim D.E. Baker D. Zhang K.Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 480-487Google Scholar)) with rmsd of 0.5Å over 230 backbone atoms for each case. Residues were considered to be at the interface when they fulfilled two conditions. 1) At least one van der Waals contact (cutoff = 4Å; calculated with program CONTACT from the CCP4 package (35Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar)) is made with a residue from the partner molecule. 2) Either the residue is fully buried upon complexation, or it buries at least 20 Å2 in the interface. The solvent-accessible surface areas were estimated with the program AREAIMOL from CCP4 (35Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond distances were calculated using the program CONTACT (35Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) with a maximum distance cut-off of 3.4 Å and defined according to the criteria of McDonald and Thornton (36McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Google Scholar). The Fab′ 19D9D6 bears a VL chain belonging to the murine κ9 family, which is related to the human κ4 family. The asymmetric unit contains two Fab′ 19D9D6·PpLD55Acomplexes related by non-crystallographic symmetry. The two complexes superimpose on each other with a rmsd of 0.6 Å over 690 backbone atoms with the largest shift observed for the PpL helix with no consequences on the interface. In contrast with the PpLwt domain which contacts two Fab molecules in the complex with human Fab 2A2 (14Graille M. Stura E.A. Housden N.G. Beckingham J.A. Bottomley S.P. Beale D. Taussig M.J. Sutton B.J. Gore M.G. Charbonnier J. Structure. 2001; 9: 679-687Google Scholar), the PpLD55A mutant binds to only one Fab′ molecule. This interaction occurs via PpL site 1 on the opposite side of the domain from the D55A mutation. The interactions made by PpLD55A with the VL region of Fab′ 19D9D6 (murine VLκ9) are different from those observed for Fab 2A2·PpLwt complex (human VLκ1) as a result of differences in their κ chain sequences. Six of the twelve VL residues involved in the Fab 2A2 VLκ1·PpLwt complex are different in the VLκ9 sequence. However, their chemical character is conserved, e.g. Ser L5 is Thr in VLκ1, Ala L12 is Ser, Val L13 is Ala, Lys L18 is Arg, Ser L22 is Thr, and Lys L24 is Arg (Fig. 1 A). These changes do not affect the overall structure of the complexes which superimpose well (rmsd of 0.6 Å over 660 backbone atoms). The PpL strand β2 and the VL β-strand A are anti-parallel and are connected through hydrogen bonds between main chain atoms from both partners forming a β-zipper interaction. This extends a β-sheet from the VL region into the PpL β-sheet as was observed in the Fab 2A2·PpLwt structure (14Graille M. Stura E.A. Housden N.G. Beckingham J.A. Bottomley S.P. Beale D. Taussig M.J. Sutton B.J. Gore M.G. Charbonnier J. Structure. 2001; 9: 679-687Google Scholar). Although the overall binding mode is unchanged, several interactions are different. Only 20 residues (11 from Fab′ 19D9D6 and 9 from PpLD55A) are involved in pairwise interactions in this structure compared with 25 in the VLκ1 complex (13 from the Fab 2A2 and 12 from PpLwt). With the exception of Glu L17, which is an aspartate in Fab 2A2, all of these positions were already identified (Fig. 1, A and B). Four hydrogen bonds out of six are common: three that mediate the formation of the β-zipper and one connecting PpL Tyr-53 hydroxyl to the Thr L20 carbonyl (TableII). This confirms that these hydrogen bonds between PpL and the VL main chain are important for the recognition of a large population of VLκ regions in a sequence-independent manner.Table IIHydrogen bonds interactions in the VL PpLD55A interfaceVLregionPpLD55A domainDistance1st complex of the asymmetric unit2nd complex of the asymmetric unitÅSer L9 NO Glu-382.72.7Ser L10 ON Glu-383.03.1Ala L12 NO Thr-362.82.7Ala L12 ON Thr-363.13.1Lys L18 ONɛ2 Gln-352.92.8Thr L20 OOη Tyr-532.62.7Lys L107 NζOγ1 Thr-363.02.9Hydrogen bonds conserved between the human VLκ1 and murine VLκ9 complexes are in bold. Open table in a new tab Hydrogen bonds conserved between the human VLκ1 and murine VLκ9 complexes are in bold. Surprisingly, although the serine L9 and L10 regions are conserved in Fab′ 19D9D6, the hydrogen bonds made from Ser L9 Oγ to Lys-40 N and from Ser L10 Oγ to Glu-38 Oε1 in the Fab 2A2·PpLwt complex are absent in this structure because of the rotation of both serine side chains. Three additional hydrogen bonds compensate for this loss. These are created by the rearrangement of the N-terminal part of PpL strand β2 and of the linker region connecting the VL to the CL domain (residues L-106 to L-112). These have been found to be among the most flexible PpL and Fab′ segments. NMR studies have shown that PpL β2 has a faster average proton exchange rate than inner strands (β1 and β4) (32Wikstrom M. Drakenberg T. Forsen S. Sjobring U. Bjorck L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14011-14017Google Scholar, 37Wikstrom M. Forsen S. Drakenberg T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 543-548Google Scholar). In the two crystal structures, this PpL segment adopts two alternative stable conformations (this study and Ref. 14Graille M. Stura E.A. Housden N.G. Beckingham J.A. Bottomley S.P. Beale D. Taussig M.J. Sutton B.J. Gore M.G. Charbonnier J. Structure. 2001; 9: 679-687Google Scholar). In the new conformation, the N-terminal portion of PpL strand β2 is closer to the VL strand A and makes two additional hydrogen bonds. The first one connects the Ala L12 carbonyl to the PpL Thr-36 amide, thus extending the β-zipper interaction by a fourth hydrogen bond (Table II and Fig. 2 A). The second links PpL Gln-35 Nε2 to the Lys L18 carbonyl. As a result, the N-terminal part of PpL strand β2 is more constrained than in the Fab 2A2·PpLwt structure (Fig. 2 A,inset). In addition, the movement of the main chain of Lys L107 from the VL-CL linker region combined with the rearrangement of its long side chain creates a hydrogen bond between Lys Nζ and Thr-36 Oγ1. Some VL positions (L5, L143 and L24) previously identified to contact PpL play no direct role in the 19D9D6 interface. First, at position L5, the change from Thr in Fab 2A2 to Ser in the Fab′ 19D9D6 eliminates a contact with Glu-49 mediated by the Thr Cγ1. Second, a difference in the VL-CL elbow angle (140° in Fab′ 19D9D6 versus 160° in Fab 2A2) eliminates the van der Waals interaction between position L143, a glutamate from the CL domain, and Lys-24 Nζ from PpL. However, in another crystal form, as a result of a change in crystal packing, the VL-CL elbow angle of the same Fab′ complexed to another PpL mutant is 165°, and position L143 regains its role in site 1. 2M. G. Gore, manuscript in preparation. This suggests that this van der Waals interaction is of secondary importance for complex formation. At position L24, a Lys replaces an Arg. Arg L24 from site 1 in the Fab 2A2·PpLwt complex is involved in van der Waals interaction with PpL Arg-52 and makes a salt bridge to VLAsp L70 from another light chain bound to site 2 (Fig. 2 B). In the Fab′ 19D9D6·PpLD55A complex, the side chain of Lys L24 is flexible as shown by the absence of strong electron density and does not contact PpL. This is not due to the loss of site 2, because in the complex with another PpL mutant that binds to two VLregions, the Lys L24 from the Fab′ 19D9D6 bound to site 1 does not contact the other Fab′ 19D9D6 bound to PpL site 2.2 This results in a decrease in the buried area from 1300 Å2 for PpLwt·VLκ1 to 1150 Å2 for VLκ9 at site 1. In summary, although the two VL regions crystallized in complex with PpL share only 50% sequence identity among the contact residues, the PpL·VL interface is largely conserved. Amino acid differences, backbone movements, and side chain rearrangements modulate the overall interaction, but a conserved core of residues from both partners ensures the ability of PpL to maintain its interaction. This ensures recognition of as much as 50% of the human immunoglobulin repertoire, mainly because the β-zipper and Tyr-53 contact only VL backbone atoms. Thus the interaction is sequence independent, and only light chains with an altered backbone conformation escape PpL recognition (e.g. VLκ2 and VLλ). In the structure presented here, the PpL region responsible for site 2 (strand β3 and one side of the α-helix) is mostly solvent exposed and is only involved in a minor crystal contact, showing that the mutagenesis has effectively targeted an important residue for site 2 (Fig.2 C). Thus, after the truncation of the Asp-55 side chain, this mutant is unable to interact through the large contact surface found in the Fab 2A2·PpLwt complex but establishes instead a minor crystal contact. Other reasons could be advanced to explain the absence of site 2 interactions; first, it could be just a crystal contact, and second, it could be due to sequence differences between the VL regions of Fab 2A2 and Fab′ 19D9D6. Both possibilities are dismissed by the analysis of the crystal packing of three other PpL mutants in complex with the same Fab′ (28Stura E.A. Graille M. Housden N.G. Gore M.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1744-1748Google Scholar). The two PpL mutant domains with intact sit"

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar). The TGF-β superfamily includes bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), growth and differentiation factors, and activins/inhibins. Three mammalian TGF-β isoforms exhibit sequence homologies higher than 70% and are functionally closely related. They, however, show different biological activities in certain cell types or systems. Appropriate levels of TGF-β activity are essential to an organism's well being (2Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Lack of sufficient TGF-β can result in immunological and inflammatory disturbances, developmental abnormalities, deficient wound healing, and increased tumorigenesis. Conversely, excessive TGF-β activity leads to scarring, the development of fibrotic diseases in multiple organ systems, and immune suppression. TGF-β is produced by virtually all cell types as an inactive precursor, which is then cleaved into a latent complex. Activation of latent TGF-β in vivo is caused by proteolytic cleavage of the latency-associated peptide (LAP), by enzymatic deglycosylation of LAP, by conformational changes of the latent complex following binding to thrombospondin, and by the acidification of the pericellular space (3Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Poczatek M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 4Mostov K. Werb Z. Science. 1997; 276: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To propagate signals across the cell membrane, the members of the TGF-β superfamily require two structurally related receptors (type I and type II), both having a short extracellular domain (ectodomain), a single membrane-spanning region, and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain (5Derynck R. Feng X.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The members of the TGF-β superfamily are homodimers held together by a disulfide bond, and each monomer has binding sites for type I and type II receptors (6Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). During the signaling process TGF-β binds first to its type II receptor (TβR2) and then to type I receptor (TβR1). The ectodomain of TβR2 binds with higher affinity to TGF-β3 than to TGF-β1, whereas the recognition of TGF-β2 has to be supported by the presence of betaglycan (7Lin H.Y. Moustakas A. Knaus P. Wells R.G. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2747-2754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the heteromeric complex of TGF-β with the receptors, the kinase domain of TβR2 phosphorylates TβR1, which in turn phosphorylates downstream intracellular signaling components (8Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar).

However, recent studies have shown important structural differences of TGF-β3 in solution with respect to its crystal structure and the structures of other TGF-βs (12Pellaud J. Schote U. Arvinte T. Seelig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7699-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Bocharov E.V. Blommers M.J.J. Kuhla J. Arvinte T. Bürgi R. Arseniev A.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In view of the therapeutic potential of TGF-β, we present here a dynamic study of TGF-β3 aimed at explaining its behavior in aqueous solution and characterizing determinants involved in the interaction with receptors. Biologically active, recombinant human TGF-β3 was prepared at Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland) by refolding in vitro the monomeric, denatured protein overexpressed in Escherichia coli (14.Cerletti, N. (July 12, 1995) World Patent WO9603433 (PCT EP95-02718; Patent 6057430; February 5, 2002).Google Scholar). NMR measurements were performed with a sample of 1.4 mm15N-labeled TGF-β3 in mixed solvent of 87% H2O, 5% D2O, 6% dioxane-d 8 and 2% methanol-d 3 at pH 2.9 and 40 °C. It was shown that these conditions do not affect the TGF-β3 structure in solution, but provide optimal resolution in 1H-15N correlation spectra of TGF-β3 (see Supplementary Material) and fully remove aggregation of TGF-β3, which prevent NMR relaxation analysis (12Pellaud J. Schote U. Arvinte T. Seelig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7699-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Bocharov E.V. Blommers M.J.J. Kuhla J. Arvinte T. Bürgi R. Arseniev A.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The backbone 15N longitudinalR 1 and transverse R 2relaxation rates and 15N{1H} NOE were measured on 11.7, 14.1, and 18.8 T Varian Unity andInova spectrometers using pulse sequences described elsewhere (15Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). The values of 15N R 1and R 2 were obtained by fitting of an exponential function to the decay of signal intensities in spectra recorded with 12 relaxation delays ranging from 10 to 1500 ms inR 1 and from 0 to 200 ms inR 2 experiments. The R 2experiments were carried out using a CPMG sequence with 1.0-ms delay between consecutive 15N 180o pulses. To account for off-resonance effects in CPMG the R 2 values were numerically corrected (16Korzhnev D.M. Tischenko E.V. Arseniev A.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The15N{1H} NOEs were calculated as a ratio of signal intensities in spectra recorded with and without prior saturation of amide protons. The delay between scans in the NOE experiment was 6.0 s. The proton saturation in the NOE experiment was achieved by a sequence of 120o1H pulses applied during 5.0 s. All spectra were processed and quantified using a macro within the VNMR software. Each of the R 1,R 2, and NOE experiments were repeated twice, and the data were averaged over the measured data sets. To account for possible small systematic errors in the experimental data, minimal uncertainties of 3% for R 1 andR 2 and ±0.05 for NOE were assumed for the subsequent “model-free” data analysis. The evidence that TGF-β3 does not aggregate at 1.4 mm concentration was provided by a R 1 experiment repeated on a diluted 0.14 mm protein sample. For comparison with the experimental data the rotation diffusion tensor D rof the TGF-β3 dimer was estimated by hydrodynamic calculations using the beads model approximation (17de la Torre J.G. Bloomfield V.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1981; 14: 81-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of the TGF-β3 dimer (10Mittl P.R.E. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grütter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1tgj). Each residue of TGF-β3 was represented by a spherical friction element (bead) of a 3.5-Å radius centered at the position of its Cα atom (18Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic interactions between beads were accounted for by a modified Oseen tensor. The calculations were performed with the DIFFC program (19Orekhov V.Y. Nolde D.E. Golovanov A.P. Korzhnev D.M. Arseniev A.S. Appl. Magn. Reson. 1995; 9: 581-588Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Model-free analysis (20Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3377) Google Scholar, 21Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1867) Google Scholar) of the relaxation data for TGF-β3 was performed with the DASHA software (19Orekhov V.Y. Nolde D.E. Golovanov A.P. Korzhnev D.M. Arseniev A.S. Appl. Magn. Reson. 1995; 9: 581-588Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using a procedure described elsewhere (22Korzhnev D.M. Billeter M. Arseniev A.S. Orekhov V.Y. Prog. Nucl. Magn.

Arseniev A.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Values of 1.02 Å for the NH internuclear distance and −170 ppm for the 15N chemical shift anisotropy were used in the analysis. The extensive set of nine independent relaxation measurements for each NH group allowed us to use the most complex anticipated model-free spectral-density function. Namely, intramolecular motion of an NH group was described by four adjustable parameters of the “extended” reorientation correlation function (24Clore G.M. Szabo A. Bax A. Kay L.E. Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 4989-4991Crossref Scopus (966) Google Scholar): order parameters S f2 andS s2 and correlation timesτ f and τ s of pico- and nanosecond motions, respectively, and as an extra parameter by the adjustable exchange term R ex proportional to the square of the magnetic field strength. Anisotropic rotational diffusion of TGF-β3 was accounted for by five-exponential overall rotation correlation functions of the NH groups (25Woessner D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1962; 37: 647-654Crossref Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The parameters of intramolecular motions of all nuclei were optimized simultaneously with six parameters of anisotropic overall rotation: rotation correlation time τ R, ratios of principal components of rotational diffusion tensor D r,D x/D z andD y/D z, and the Euler angles α, β, and γ defining the orientation of the molecular frame where D r has diagonal form with respect to the reference molecular frame. The uncertainties of the optimized parameters were obtained from the covariance matrix of the optimized model (26Press W.H. Tenkolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1997: 689-699Google Scholar). The directions of the NH vectors in the reference molecular coordinate frame were taken from the crystal structure of TGF-β3 (10Mittl P.R.E. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grütter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1tgj). 15N relaxation data were obtained for the backbone amides of 86 out of the 103 non-proline residues of TGF-β3 at magnetic fields of 11.7, 14.1, and 18.8 T. The relaxation data for the remaining residues were not extracted due to spectral overlap and/or resonance broadening (especially for the N-terminal residues 6–17). The measured15N{1H} NOE, 15NR 1, and R 2 values (Fig.1, a–c) exhibit significant variations along the protein sequence. Namely, residues 2–5, 31, 50–75, 82, and 91–98 with lowered 15N{1H} NOE and 15N R 2 values appear to exhibit significant pico- to nanosecond time scale motions. Residues 13, 18, 21, 27, 30, 32, 42, 43, 86, and 104 have enhancedR 2, indicating micro-millisecond conformational exchange. A more rigorous analysis of the relaxation data was performed using the model-free approach (20Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). The experimental relaxation data were fit by simultaneous optimization of the parameters of anisotropic rotation of TGF-β3 and the parameters of intramolecular motions of individual NH groups for all 15N nuclei. This procedure yields an overall rotation correlation time τ R of 16.0 ± 0.3 ns, which is somewhat higher than the 14.3 ± 0.6 ns calculated from the mean of the 15NR 2/R 1 ratios of all NH groups in regular secondary structure elements with15N{1H} NOE values higher than 0.6. Such an underestimation is inherent to τ R values derived from R 2/R 1 ratios with the assumption of very fast internal dynamics due to the unaccounted contributions of nanosecond time scale motions (22Korzhnev D.M. Billeter M. Arseniev A.S. Orekhov V.Y. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2001; 38: 197-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The ratios of principal components of the rotational diffusion tensorDx/Dz = 0.72 ± 0.14 and Dy/Dz = 0.78 ± 0.16 derived from the relaxation data reveal moderate anisotropy of TGF-β3 tumbling in solution. Hydrodynamics calculations based on the crystal structure of the TGF-β3 dimer predicts similar rotation diffusion tensor although with more pronounced anisotropy:Dx/Dz = 0.42 andDy/Dz = 0.45. These results suggest a less extended fold of the TGF-β3 dimer in solution than in crystal, probably due to less compact packing of regular structure elements. This is in agreement with our previous NMR study (13Bocharov E.V. Blommers M.J.J. Kuhla J. Arvinte T. Bürgi R. Arseniev A.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which showed that the secondary structure and the global fold of the TGF-β3 dimer in solution are close to those obtained for the protein crystal, but some regions are in dynamic equilibrium with an unfolded conformation. Moreover the CD studies in aqueous solution show that the α-helical content of TGF-β3 in solution is less then expected from the known crystal and solution structures of TGF-βs, including free TGF-β3 in crystal (12Pellaud J. Schote U. Arvinte T. Seelig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7699-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, a good agreement between the experimental CD spectrum measured in aqueous solution at pH 3.0 and CD spectrum calculated from crystal structure was found for TGF-β2 (12Pellaud J. Schote U. Arvinte T. Seelig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7699-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Model-free analysis of the relaxation data yields the order parametersS f2 andS s2 describing motions in the picosecond and nanosecond time scales, respectively, and the corresponding correlation times τ f and τ s(Fig. 1, d–f). The generalized order parameterS 2 =S f2 S s2, plotted in Fig. 1 d, characterizes therefore fast motions, in contrast to exchange contribution R ex (Fig.1 g) to R 2 and resonance broadening, which indicate slow motions in the micro-millisecond time range. The generalized order parameter S 2 provides a measure of the amplitude of internal motion, whereS 2 = 1 means that the given N-H bond vector is fixed on the pico- to nanosecond time scale, andS 2 = 0 indicates that the motion is unrestricted. These internal dynamic properties derived from the relaxation analysis are summarized in Fig.2 by color-coded ribbon diagrams of the TGF-β3 crystal structure (10Mittl P.R.E. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grütter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 a summarizes fast motions by mapping of the generalized order parameterS 2 to the three-dimensional structure, while Fig. 2 b visualizes regions with slow motions. Several regions of TGF-β3 displaying different types of internal motions of various amplitudes and time scales, from fast pico- to nanosecond dynamics to slow conformational transitions on micro-millisecond and second time scales, were identified and are characterized below. Each monomer of the TGF-β3 dimer adopts an extended fold made up of four helices and four β-strands arranged in two irregular antiparallel β-sheets, βA/βB and βC/βD (see Fig.3 c) (10Mittl P.R.E. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grütter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Bocharov E.V. Blommers M.J.J. Kuhla J. Arvinte T. Bürgi R. Arseniev A.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The β-sheets represent the most rigid part of TGF-β3 having high order parameters. Slightly enhanced pico- to nanosecond mobility with loweredS 2 values is observed in the vicinity of the short breaks of both β-sheets located at residues 19–20/41–42 and 81–82/107–108, especially for residues 18, 21, 41, 82, and 107. Additionally, the spatially adjacent segments 18–21/40–43 and 86–87/102–104, which are close to the break and twist of the first and the second β-sheets, respectively, are involved in micro-millisecond motion as revealed by R ex and resonance broadening observed for the residues from the first β-sheet. Residues 77 and 79 in the hydrophobic dimer interface and residues 34 and 90 in the hydrophobic pocket near the first β-sheet loop are also affected by slow conformational exchange. The largely remote region 91–97 comprising the hairpin loop formed by β-strands βC and βD undergoes rapid internal motions on the 20–30-ps time scale with loweredS f2 values, whereas this region is relatively rigid on the nanosecond time scale. Besides, residues 93 and 95 from this region exhibit slow conformational exchange. In the crystal structure residues 4–9 form α-helix H1followed by a disordered, solvent-exposed loop delimited by disulfide bridge 7–16. The segment 6–17 is involved in extensive millisecond time scale motions limiting our ability to obtain reliable15N relaxation data due to the strong resonance broadening. Another region having slow conformational dynamics is the segment between the β-strands βA and βB, including the one-turn α-helix H2 (residues 24–28) and an extended loop 29–32. Note that the loop 29–32 is also flexible on the pico- to nanosecond time scale revealed by lowered order parameters for residues 29 and 31. The most flexible regions of the molecule are the N-terminal residues 2–5 and the region between the β-sheet strands βB and βC with residues 51–75 comprising the central α-helixH3 and the one-turn 310-helix H4. In this region, the low and non-uniform order parametersS s2 andS f2 and the high τ fof 40–70 ps suggest a wide range of processes occurring in the pico- to nanosecond time scale presumably connected with temporary ruptures of the helices H3 and H4. The helix-coil equilibrium in TGF-β3 was previously suggested based on the chemical shift indices of 1Hα and on 1H-NOE connectivities (13Bocharov E.V. Blommers M.J.J. Kuhla J. Arvinte T. Bürgi R. Arseniev A.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Additionally, the region 48–75 is involved in another slow process resulting in disproportional doubling and/or tailing of the amide resonances. This process likely occurs on the second time scale with characteristic times slower than 15NT 1 revealed by the absence of detectable exchange cross peaks in ZZ-exchange spectra (27Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). A possible source of this slow exchange is cis-trans isomerization of the Cys48-Pro49 and/or Ser75-Pro76 peptide bonds. The members of the TGF-β superfamily mediate their functions by binding to cell surface receptors. Several functional regions in TGF-β were mapped using site-directed mutagenesis of TGF-β1 and domain swap approach applied to TGF-β1/β2 chimeras (28Huang S.S. Zhou M. Johnson F.E. Shieh H.-S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27754-27758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Ohlsen D.J. Phan S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It was shown that region 52–55 is very important for the interaction of TGF-β with the cell receptors, whereas region 92–98 regulates specific binding of isoforms to TβR2 only. Lately, for BMP-2 (6Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), activin A (30Gray P.C. Greenwald J. Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S. Donaldson C.J. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3206-3212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (31Eketjall S. Fainzilber M. Murray-Rust J. Ilbanez F.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5901-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), i.e. other members of the TGF-β superfamily, mutant proteins that exhibit altered biological activity and receptor binding affinity were constructed and analyzed. Furthermore, the crystal structure of BMP-2 in complex with two ectodomains of its type I receptor (ecBR1A2·BMP-2) and the recently obtained crystal structure of TGF-β3 in complex with two ectodomains of its type II receptor (ecTβR22·TGF-β3) now serve as the prototypes for the intermediate complexes of the TGF-β superfamily (32Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 33Hart P.J. Deep S. Taylor A.B. Shu Z. Hinck C.S. Hinck A.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the ecTβR2·TGF-β3 interface with either the activin-binding site on ecActR2 or the ecBR2-binding site on BMP-2 suggests that there is significant structural diversity in the manner by which type II receptors of the TGF-β superfamily interact with their cognate ligands (33Hart P.J. Deep S. Taylor A.B. Shu Z. Hinck C.S. Hinck A.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, two epitopes designated as “wrist” and “knuckle” interacting with BMP type I and type II receptors, respectively, were found and mapped onto the spatial structure of BMP-2. In addition the “fingertips” epitope recognizing the TGF-β type II receptor was found in the TGF-β3 ligand. Overall, these findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the TGF-β superfamily. The monomer fold of the TGF-β dimer was described as an outstretched “hand” with the N-terminal α-helix H1 as the “thumb” and the extended sheets as slightly curled “fingers” (9Daopin S. Piez K.A. Ogava Y. Davies D.R. Science. 1992; 257: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 10Mittl P.R.E. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grütter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 a). It was determined that the residues of the loops at the tips of both β-sheets form the high affinity fingertips epitope (33Hart P.J. Deep S. Taylor A.B. Shu Z. Hinck C.S. Hinck A.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar). The wrist epitope comprises residues of α-helix H3 and its pre-helix loop of one subunit and contacts both the inner side of the loop at the tip of the first β-sheet and the C-terminal part of β-strand βC of the other subunit of the dimer (32Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In turn the putative knuckle epitope mapped (6Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) onto the outer convex surfaces of both β-sheets is spatially adjacent to the fingertips epitope and opposite the wrist epitope. The color-coded ribbon diagrams (Fig. 2, a and b) demonstrate that the most dynamic regions of the TGF-β3 dimer exactly correspond to the receptor-binding sites of the fingertips as well as wrist epitopes in contrast to the knuckle epitope. For clarity we constructed the model of TGF-β3-receptor signaling complex based on the crystal structures of ecBR1A2·BMP2 (32Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and ecTβR22·TGF-β3 (33Hart P.J. Deep S. Taylor A.B. Shu Z. Hinck C.S. Hinck A.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar) complexes (Fig. 2 c). Interestingly the interface between subunits of free TGF-β3 is flexible, which suggests the possibility of the structural accommodation of the TGF-β3 dimeric fold upon receptor binding. This is consistent with the fact that ecTβR2-bound TGF-β3 shows an altered arrangement of its monomeric subunits (33Hart P.J. Deep S. Taylor A.B. Shu Z. Hinck C.S. Hinck A.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming that the backbone mobility of TGF-β3 active sites is reduced upon receptor binding, one would expect a strongly unfavorable entropic contribution to the free energy of complex formation (34Yang D. Kay L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). All sources of changes in free energy are critical in the delicate energy balance that determines the equilibrium populations of protein-ligand or protein-protein interactions. This implies that the loss of conformational entropy due to the ordering of TGF-β3 binding surface must be efficiently compensated by hydrophobic interactions and enthalpic factors such as H-bond or electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the enhancement of TGF-β3 internal mobility tends to cluster at both epitopes that may indicate localized “hot spots” (35Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar) of binding free energy. The hairpin loop region 92–95, the one-turn α-helix H2, and the extended loop 29–32 are suitable for such hot spots in the fingertips epitope of TGF-β3. The residues Arg25 and Arg94 from these regions play an important role in determining binding specificity and affinity to TβR2 (29Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Ohlsen D.J. Phan S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Hart P.J. Deep S. Taylor A.B. Shu Z. Hinck C.S. Hinck A.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar). Several potential hot spots of binding free energy are observed in the more spacious wrist epitope putative for recognizing the TGF-β type I receptor. The most prominent of these is the central α-helixH3 with its pre-helix loop identified as an active site by mutagenesis analysis (28Huang S.S. Zhou M. Johnson F.E. Shieh H.-S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27754-27758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) of TGF-β1. Another candidate common with the fingertips epitope is region 29–32 situated in a hydrophobic pocket nearby the outer part of the β-sheet loops. This pocket in TGF-β3 can accommodate a dioxane molecule both in crystal (10Mittl P.R.E. Priestle J.P. Cox D.A. McMaster G. Cerletti N. Grütter M.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and in solution (13Bocharov E.V. Blommers M.J.J. Kuhla J. Arvinte T. Bürgi R. Arseniev A.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the BR1A2·BMP-2 complex this hydrophobic pocket interacts with the side chain of Phe85 of BR1A corresponding to Phe84 of TβR1. That is perhaps a key feature for the recognition of type I receptor within the TGF-β superfamily (32Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus"
https://openalex.org/W2075791770,"The homozygous mouse mutant weaver exhibits a massive loss of cerebellar granule neurons postnatally. The death of these cells is associated with a single amino acid mutation in the G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Girk2. Evidence suggests that both the mutated Girk2 channel and the calcium channel-associated N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor play important roles in the apoptotic death of weaver cerebellar granule cells, but the downstream events associated with this process are unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the consequences of the mutation result in caspase activation. In addition, our results show that caspase inhibition in vivo decreases caspase activation and granule cell apoptosis and significantly improves behavioral deficits associated with the weaver's phenotype."

The genes are expressed at the mRNA level in different developmental stages of T. cruzi:TcHA1 is expressed maximally in epimastigotes, whereasTcHA2 is expressed predominantly in trypomastigotes.

H+-ATPases within the P-type ATPase family are proton pumps driven by the hydrolysis of ATP. These pumps have been found almost exclusively in the plasma membrane of plants and fungi (1Palmgren M.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). A sequence analysis of conserved core sequences of all P-type ATPases has grouped them in five subfamilies designated types I–V (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Type III covers H+-ATPases (type IIIA) and a small group of Mg2+-ATPases from bacteria (type IIIB). All fungal P-type H+-ATPases comprise one subcluster within type IIIA, the plant enzymes comprise a second subcluster, and sequences found in the trypanosomatid parasite Leishmania donovani make up a third subcluster (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Because the L. donovani sequences (LHA1A and LHA1B) are obviously distinct from the plant and yeast H+-ATPase sequences, some authors (3Wach A. Schlesser A. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 309-317PubMed Google Scholar) have raised the question of whether they are indeed H+-ATPases, as was inferred from sequence homology (4Meade J.C. Shaw J. Lemaster S. Gallagher G. Stringer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3937-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Meade J.C. Hudson K.M. Stringer S.L. Stringer J.R. Mol. Biochem.

Confirmation of the substrate specificities of cloned P-type ATPases requires, in addition to demonstration of amino acid identity to biochemically well characterized proteins, expression of the genes followed by biochemical characterization of the gene products (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Among P-type H+-ATPases, this has been done until now only with plant and fungal transporters (8Villalba J.M.

Plant H+-ATPases belong to multigene families, with individual members expressed in particular cell types. In some cases up to three H+-ATPase genes may be expressed in the same cell type at the same developmental stage, suggesting that isoforms with distinct catalytic or regulatory properties may coexist in the same cell (13Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 14Morsomme P. Boutry M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In unicellular organisms the presence of several genes encoding H+-ATPases is also frequent. The PMA2 gene product in yeast shows 89% identity to the PMA1 gene product (15Schlesser A. Ulaszewski S. Ghislain M. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), althoughPMA2 is expressed at very low levels and is not essential for growth (16Supply P. Wach A. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19753-19759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease or American trypanosomiasis. T. cruzi has been recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Mexico and Central and South America (17Anonymous 13th Program Report, UNDP/World Bank/World Health Organization Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, Progress 1995–1996. World Health Organization, Geneva1997: 112-123Google Scholar). Chagas' disease remains a problem because of limited therapeutic choices and adverse reactions to the two drugs available, nifurtimox and benznidazole (17Anonymous 13th Program Report, UNDP/World Bank/World Health Organization Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, Progress 1995–1996. World Health Organization, Geneva1997: 112-123Google Scholar, 18Kirchhoff L.V. New Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to identify enzymes and metabolic processes in T. cruzi which might be potential targets for drug development.T. cruzi has three main developmental stages: the epimastigote, which is found in the insect vector and can be grown in axenic culture; the amastigote or intracellular form, which lives in the cytosol of nucleated cells; and the trypomastigote, which is the terminal differentiation stage in the vector (metacyclic form) or is found in the bloodstream from mammalian hosts (bloodstream form). In the present study, we report the cloning and sequencing of a pair of genes linked in tandem from T. cruzi which encode proteins with homology to the L. donovani putative P-type H+-ATPase cluster. The T. cruzi genes are expressed differentially in the different developmental stages ofT. cruzi and can complement a yeast strain deficient in P-type H+-ATPase, providing genetic evidence for their function. The protein products of these genes localize to the yeast plasma membrane. Reconstitution of plasma membranes into proteoliposomes permits the detection of ATP-driven proton transport, and the two T. cruzi H+-ATPases show different biochemical properties. Together, these results provide the first evidence for the presence of a functional plasma membrane P-type H+-ATPase in organisms other than plants and fungi. T. cruzi amastigotes and trypomastigotes (Y strain) were obtained from the culture medium of L6E9 myoblasts as described before (19VanderHeyden N. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem.

PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. For library screening, 3.0 × 105 plaque-forming units (approximately three times the content of the library) were plated at a density of 2 × 104 plaque-forming units/90-mm plate on host strain LE392. Plaques were allowed to develop to ∼1.0 mm in diameter before being lifted onto nylon membranes. Membranes were probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes according to standard procedures. Positive plaques identified in the screen were serially plaqued to homogeneity. Southern and Northern hybridization were done by standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

TheTcP0 fragment used as a control in Northern blots was obtained by amplifying T. cruzi genomic DNA by PCR, with primers corresponding to nucleotides 3–54 and 918–936 in the sequence of the TcP0 gene (25Skeiky Y.A.W. Benson D.R. Parsons M. Elkon K.B. Reed S.G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Densitometric analyses of Northern blots was done using an ISI-1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Inotech Corp.). Comparison in levels of the H+-ATPase transcripts in the different stages was done taking as a reference the densitometric values obtained with the TcP0 transcripts and assuming a similar level of expression of this gene in all stages (25Skeiky Y.A.W. Benson D.R. Parsons M. Elkon K.B. Reed S.G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the densitometric values were compared taking into account the amount of RNA added to each lane in three different experiments. First strand cDNA synthesis was primed with an oligonucleotide that annealed to 911 bp downstream from the putative start codon of the TcHA2 open reading frame (RTP3′1: 5′-GGAATGGACACCACAAGCAC-3′, 3627–3646, 7483–7502 bp) in a reaction containing 1 mm dNTPs, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1× SuperScript PCR buffer, 200 units SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, and total RNA (5 μg). Target sequences were amplified in a standard PCR using the first strand cDNA as template and primers Tc-5′-SL (5′-GCGGTCCATAGAACAGTTTCTGTAC-3′), which annealed to the 5′-spliced leader sequence of T. cruzi mRNA, and a downstream primer that annealed to a sequence just 461 bp upstream from the primer used for first strand cDNA synthesis (RTP3′2: 5′-TTCTTCAGCGCAGCCACAGC-3′, 3147–3166, 7003–7022 bp). The product of the amplification reaction was ligated into vector pCR2.1TOPO for sequence analysis. DNA sequence data were generated at the High Throughput Sequencing and Genotyping Unit of the Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Sequence analysis was done using the Biology Workbench 3.0 utility (workbench.sdsc.edu) and the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (Version 8.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Hydropathy analysis was done with the Gene Jockey sequence processor (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Plasmids pMP625, derived from YEp351 (26Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) and containing the promoter and terminator of PMA1, and pRS890 (8Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberián G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), containing the yeast PMA1 gene, were kindly provided by Dr. Palmgren (University of Copenhagen, Denmark). The full-length coding regions of TcHA1 and TcHA2 were amplified from λ5-1 clone DNA using the primers YA1P5, 5′-CTCGAGATGGTACCGCCGTCCAAGGG-3′ (2886–2905 bp), which includes an underlined XhoI site, and YA1P31, 5′-ACTAGTTTACACCGTGGGTTCCTTTG-3′ (5494–5513 bp), with an underlined SpeI site; YA2P51, 5′-CTCGAGATGGACCAGAAGAACGATAA-3′ (6592–6611 bp) and YA2P31, 5′-ACTAGTTTAATTGGCAGGCTCAGTGA-3′ (9326–9345 bp). The PCR products were subcloned into XhoI andSpeI sites of pMP625 to generate plasmid pRD201 (TcHA1/pMP625) and pRD203 (TcHA2/pMP625). To delete the C terminus of TcHA1 and TcHA2, PCRs were made utilizing primers YA1P5 and YA1P32, 5′-ACTAGTTTAAGCGTCCTGAATAAGCC-3′, which include an underlined SpeI site followed by an antisense stop codon and the antisense nucleotides 5350–5366 bp; YAP51 and YAP32, 5′-ACTAGTTTAAGCGTCCTGAATAAGCC-3′ (9206–9222 bp). The PCR products were truncated by either 144 bp (last 48 amino acids of TcHA1) or 120 bp (last 40 amino acids of TcHA2). To delete the N terminus of TcHA2, the PCR amplification was performed by using primers YA2P52, 5′-CTCGAGATGGTACCGCCGTCCAAGGG-3′ (6742–6760 bp) and YA2P31. The PCR product was truncated by 150 bp (first 50 amino acids of TcHA2). The shortened genes were subcloned into XhoI and SpeI sites of pMP625 to obtain pRD202 (TcHA1Δ48/pMP625), pRD204 (TcHA2Δ40/pMP625), and pRD205 (TcHA2N-Δ50/pMP625) with the right orientation for expression. All PCR amplifications were carried out usingPfu DNA polymerase, which exhibits the lowest error rate of any thermostable DNA polymerase. The PCRs were performed in a total reaction volume of 50 μl for 25 cycles of 96 °C for 1 min, 55–60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min using a thermal cycler. All constructs were sequenced to confirm their identity. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain RS-72 (MATa, ade1–100 his4–519 leu2–3, 112; 10), carrying the yeast PMA1 gene under the control of the galactokinase gene (GAL1) promoter, was used for transformation with LEU2 plasmids (26Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Yeast were grown on synthetic medium (SGAHL) containing 2% (w/v) galactose, 0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 0.2 mmadenine, 0.4 mm histidine, and 1 mm leucine. Yeast were made competent for plasmid uptake by treatment with lithium acetate and polyethyleneglycol according to Gietz et al.(27Gietz D., St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Positive transformants were selected on SGAH medium (SGAHL without leucine) after 4 days of growth at 30 °C. The new strains (bearing the respective plasmids) were named MP625 (pMP625), RS1002 (pRS890), RD2011 (pRD201), RD2022 (pRD202), RD2033 (pRD203), RD2044 (pRD204), and RD2055 (pRD205). Transformants were maintained in SGAH or transferred to medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose in place of galactose (SDAH). The media were buffered with 50 mmsuccinic acid adjusted to pH 5.5 (or other pH values in pH growth experiments) with Tris. Solid media contained 2% agar (Difco). Yeast strain RS1002, RD2011, or RD2055 grown in 300 ml of SDAH to anA 600 of ∼5 was recovered by centrifugation (1,300 × g), washed once in water, and suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 25 mmHepes, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 15 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5% protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.5). An equal volume of glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) was added, and the mixture was vortexed for 3–5 min, until 80–90% of the yeast was lysed, as quantified by microscopy of yeast diluted in water. The glass beads were washed by gravity with 20% v/v glycerol, 25 mm Hepes, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5 (glycerol buffer). The supernatant (lysate) was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells and debris, and the supernatant from this was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet fraction was suspended in 4 ml of glycerol buffer and applied to a sucrose step gradient: 8 ml of 43% w/w sucrose over 4 ml of 53% w/w sucrose (both with 25 mm Hepes, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5). The gradient was centrifuged for 6 h at 25,000 rpm (Beckman SW28 rotor) to prepare a plasma membrane fraction (28Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This fraction was recovered from the 43/53% interface, diluted 5× in water, and centrifuged at 80,000 × gfor 20 min. Pellets were resuspended in glycerol buffer and stored at −80 °C before use. The H+-ATPase proteins expressed in yeast plasma membrane were reconstituted into proteoliposomes by a modification of the method of de Kerchove d'Exaerde et al. (10De Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Dufour J.-P. Bogaerts P. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23828-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane preparations were diluted to 0.5–2 mg of protein/ml in 10 mm MES, 50 mm K2SO4, 20% glycerol, pH 6.6 (MKG buffer). Liposomes were prepared by suspending 50 mg/ml soybean phospholipids in MKG buffer and sonicating until dispersed, adding 0.3 volume of 10% w/v sodium deoxycholate in MKG buffer, and diluting with a further 0.7 volume of MKG buffer. Liposomes (1.5 ml) were added to 1 ml of diluted plasma membrane and left on ice for 10 min, with shaking every 30 s before centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in MKG buffer and stored at −80 °C before use. The soybean phospholipids used for preparation of liposomes were checked for lack of ATPase activity using the assay described below. A 0.78-kb PCR fragment, named TcHAf (probe c) encoding a 260-amino acid non-transmembrane domain of the TcHA2 protein, was cloned into the pGEM-T vector and digested by EcoRI andBamHI. The fragment was then subcloned into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of the pET-28a(+) expression vector, resulting in a construct that encoded the protein fused to a six-histidine tag that allowed its purification on nickel-agarose columns. This plasmid was checked by DNA sequencing to ensure that the correct construct had been obtained. The recombinant plasmid was transfected into the DE3 strain of Escherichia coli, the fusion protein was induced, and the expressed protein of about 35 kDa, present in inclusion bodies, was solubilized and purified according to the manufacturer's instruction (Novagen). Rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 1 mg of fusion protein emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed 2 weeks later by subcutaneous injection of 1 mg of fusion protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. At 6, 10, and 14 weeks after the initial injection, rabbits were boosted with 1 mg of fusion protein in PBS containing a 10 mg/ml suspension of Al(OH)3. Serum was collected before the initial injection (preimmune serum) and 7–10 days after each boost. Affinity purification of anti-TcHAf antibody was performed using cyanogen bromide-activated matrices. Briefly, purified TcHAf fusion protein was coupled in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.5, and mixed with cyanogen-bromide activated resin for 2 h at room temperature. After being blocked with 0.2 m glycine, pH 8.0, for 2 h at room temperature and washed extensively with basic coupling buffer, pH 8.5, and with 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4, containing 0.5 m NaCl, the column was incubated with the anti-TcHAf serum for 1 h at room temperature to bind the specific antibody to the TcHAf protein. Then the column was washed with PBS three times, and the antibody was eluted with elution buffer (1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8) supplemented with azide to a final concentration of 0.05% and stored at 4 °C. Samples of yeast fractions (10 μg of protein) were mixed with 10 μl of 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 10% w/v β-mercaptoethanol, 20% w/v glycerol, 4.0% w/v SDS, and 4.0% w/v bromophenol blue as tracking dye and boiled for 5 min before application to SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10%). Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose with a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus. After transfer, the nitrocellulose was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1% Tween 20-PBS overnight (Tween-PBS) at 4 °C. A 1:10,000 dilution of affinity-purified antiserum in Tween-PBS was then applied at room temperature for 60 min. The nitrocellulose was washed three times for 15 min each with Tween-PBS and incubated with secondary antibody (1:20,000) at room temperature for 60 min. Immunoblots were visualized on radiographic film using the ECL enhanced chemoluminescence detection kit and according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). ATP-driven proton transport into proteoliposomes reconstituted from plasma membrane preparations was measured by following spectral changes in acridine orange absorbance using a method described previously (29Scott D.A. de Souza W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), with the replacement of pyrophosphate by 1 mm ATP. In addition, the assay buffer contained 5 mm sodium azide and 100 nmbafilomycin A1 to suppress mitochondrial and vacuolar H+-ATPase activities, respectively (8Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberián G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dröse S. Altendorf K. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 50 mm potassium nitrate to provide a membrane-permeant anion (28Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The mixture for assaying ATP hydrolysis activity in plasma membrane preparations was similar to that of Villalba et al. (8Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberián G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): 50 mm MES, adjusted to pH 6.5 with Tris (or between pH 5.75 and pH 7.5 for pH optimum studies), 5 mm MgSO4, 50 mm KNO3, 5 mm sodium azide, 2 mm sodium molybdate, and 2 mm ATP. Assays were done at room temperature in microtiter plate wells in a volume of 50 μl containing 4 μg of plasma membrane protein. At intervals, 50 μl of 12% SDS was added to stop the reaction in individual wells. Color development to measure free phosphate was then done as per Chifflet et al. (32Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The plate was read at 800 nm on a Power Wave 340i microplate reader (Bio-tek Instruments, Winooski, VT) and calibrated using phosphate standards. For estimation of Km for ATP, ATP concentrations in the range 0.05–10 mm were used, and the assay mixture contained additionally 5 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate as an ATP-regenerating system. MgSO4 concentrations in these assays were increased to 10 mm. Km values were calculated using the Solver function in MS Excel to calculate sum of least squares in fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the experimental data (for methodology, see orion1.paisley.ac.uk/kinetics/contents.html). Fixation and immunofluorescence microscopy of yeast cells were performed as described by Pringle et al. (33Pringle J.R. Adams A. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Permeabilization was accomplished by immersion in methanol at −20 °C for 6 min and then in acetone at −20 °C for 30 s. A 1:100 dilution of affinity-purified antibody against the 35-kDa expressed protein in PBS was applied at room temperature for 30 min, and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) secondary antibody (1:150) was then applied at room temperature for 30 min. Control preparations were incubated with preimmune serum. Slides were observed using an Olympus BX-60 microscope, and digital images were obtained using the system described previously (34Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).
