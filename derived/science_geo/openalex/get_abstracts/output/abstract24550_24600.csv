https://openalex.org/W1601097124,"The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of myocardial triglycerides to overall ATP production in isolated working rat hearts. Endogenous lipid pools were initially prelabeled (pulsed) by perfusing hearts for 60 min with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1.2 mM [1-14C]palmitate. During a subsequent 60-min period (chase), hearts were perfused with either no fat, low fat (0.4 mM [9,10-3H] palmitate), or high fat (1.2 mM [9,10-3H]palmitate). All buffers contained 11 mM glucose. During the 14CO2 production (a measure of endogenous fatty acid oxidation) and 3H2O production (a measure of exogenous fatty acid oxidation) were determined. Oxidative rates of endogenous fatty acids during the chase were 279 +/- 50, 88 +/- 14, and 88 +/- 8 nmol of [14C]palmitate oxidized per g dry weight.min in the no fat, low fat, and high fat groups, respectively, compared to exogenous palmitate oxidation rates of 0, 361 +/- 68, and 633 +/- 60 nmol of [3H]palmitate/g dry weight.min, in the no fat, low fat, and high fat groups, respectively. Endogenous [14C]palmitate oxidation rates were matched by loss of [14C]palmitate from endogenous myocardial triglycerides. Overall triglyceride content decreased during the no fat and low fat chase perfusion but did not change during the high fat chase. Loss of triglyceride [14C]palmitate during the high fat chase was matched by incorporation of exogenous [3H]palmitate in triglycerides. In a second series of perfusions, three groups of hearts were perfused under similar conditions, except that unlabeled palmitate was used during the pulse and that 11 mM [2-3H/U-14C]glucose and unlabeled palmitate was present during the chase. During the chase, both glycolysis (3H2O production) and glucose oxidation (14CO2 production) rates were measured. Rates of glucose oxidation were inversely related to the fatty acid concentration in the perfusate (1257 +/- 158, 366 +/- 40, and 124 +/- 26 nmol of glucose oxidized per min.g dry weight in the no fat, low fat, and high fat groups, respectively), while rates of glycolysis were not significantly different between these groups. Calculation of overall ATP production from both oxidative and glycolytic sources determined that even in the presence of high concentrations of fatty acids, myocardial triglyceride turnover can provide over 11% of steady state ATP production in the aerobically perfused heart. In the absence of fatty acids, myocardial triglyceride fatty acids can become the major energy substrate of the heart.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Cotransfection analyses in which the dsx gene and the female-specific transformer (tra) and transformer-2 (tra-2) complementary DNAs were expressed in Drosophila Kc cells revealed that female-specific splicing of the dsx transcript was positively regulated by the products of the tra and tra-2 genes. Furthermore, analyses of mutant constructs of dsx showed that a portion of the female-specific exon sequence was required for regulation of dsx pre-messenger RNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2007019498,"Twelve maternal effect loci are required for the production of Drosophila embryos with a correct dorsoventral axis. Analysis of mosaic females indicates that the expression of the genes nudel, pipe, and windbeutel is required in the somatic tissue, presumably in the follicle cells that surround the oocyte. Thus, information coming from outside the egg cell influences dorsoventral pattern formation during embryogenesis. In transplantation experiments, the perivitelline fluid from the compartment surrounding the embryo can restore dorsoventral pattern to embryos from females mutant for nudel, pipe, or windbeutel. The positioning of the transplanted pervitelline fluid also determines the polarity of the restored dorsoventral axis. We propose that the polarizing activity, normally present at the ventral side of the egg, is a ligand for the Toll receptor. Presumably, local activation of the Toll protein by the ligand initiates the formation of the nuclear concentration gradient of the dorsal protein, thereby determining dorsoventral pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1549241464,"Clusterin/human complement lysis inhibitor (CLI) is incorporated stoichiometrically into the soluble terminal complement complex and inhibits the cytolytic reaction of purified complement components C5b-9 in vitro. Using an anti-clusterin affinity column, we found that an additional protein component with a molecular mass of 28-kDa co-purifies with clusterin from human plasma. We show by immunoblotting and amino acid sequencing that this component is apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). By using physiological salt buffers containing 0.5% Triton X-100, apoA-I is completely dissociated from clusterin bound to the antibody column. Free clusterin immobilized on the antibody-Sepharose selectively retains apoA-I from total human plasma. Delipidated apoA-I and to a lesser extent ultracentrifugation-purified high density lipoproteins (HDL) adsorbed to nitrocellulose also have a binding affinity for purified clusterin devoid of apoA-I. The isolated apoA-I-clusterin complex contains approximately 22% (w/w) lipids which are composed of 54% (mole/mol) total cholesterol (molar ratio of unesterified/esterified cholesterol, 0.58), 42% phospholipids, and 4% triglycerides. In agreement with the low lipid content, apoA-I-clusterin complexes are detected only in trace amounts in HDL fractions prepared by density ultracentrifugation. In free flow isotachophoresis, the purified apoA-I-clusterin complex has the same mobility as the native clusterin complex in human plasma and is found in the slow-migrating HDL fraction of fasting plasma. Our data indicate that clusterin circulates in plasma as a HDL complex, which may serve not only as an inhibitor of the lytic terminal complement cascade, but also as a regulator of lipid transport and local lipid redistribution."

https://openalex.org/W1497014448,"Heterodimeric human factor VIII was proteolytically activated by catalytic levels of thrombin to yield the (labile) active cofactor factor VIIIa possessing an initial specific activity of approximately 80 units/microgram. Activation paralleled the generation of fragments A1 and A2 derived from the heavy chain and A3-C1-C2 derived from the light chain. Chromatography of factor VIIIa, on Mono-S buffered at pH 6.0 resulted in separation of the bulk of the A2 fragment from a fraction composed predominantly of A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer plus low levels of A2 fragment. Only the latter fraction contained clotting activity (approximately 20 units/microgram) which was stable and represented a less than 10% yield when compared with the peak activity of unfractionated factor VIIIa. Further depletion of A2 fragment from Mono-S-purified factor VIIIA, achieved using an immobilized monoclonal antibody to the A2 domain, yielded a relatively inactive A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (less than 0.4 unit/microgram). Factor VIIIa (greater than 40 units/microgram) was reconstituted from the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer plus the A2 fragment in a reaction that was Me(2+)-independent and inhibited by moderate ionic strength. Reassociation of A2 required the A1 subunit in that the A2 subunit associated weakly if at all to A3-C1-C2 in the absence of A1. These results indicated that human factor VIIIa is a trimer represented by the subunits A1/A2/A3-C1-C2 and that the A2 subunit is required for expression of factor VIIIa activity."
https://openalex.org/W1543532453,"Insulin secretion in the intact organism, and by the perfused pancreas and groups of isolated perifused islets, is pulsatile. We have proposed a metabolic model of glucose-induced insulin secretion in which oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio drive alterations in metabolic and electrical events that lead to insulin release. A key prediction of our model is that metabolically driven Ca2+ oscillations will also occur. Using the fluorescent Ca2+ probe, fura 2, digital image analysis, and sensitive O2 electrodes, we investigated cytosolic free Ca2+ responses and O2 consumption in perifused rat islets that had been maintained in culture for 1-4 days. We found that elevated ambient glucose increased the average cytosolic free Ca2+ level, the ATP/ADP ratio, and oxygen consumption, as previously found in freshly isolated islets. Oscillatory patterns were obtained for Ca2+, O2 consumption, and insulin secretion in the presence of 10 and 20 mM glucose. Very low amplitude oscillations in cytosolic free Ca2+ were observed at 3 mM nonstimulatory glucose levels. Evaluation of the Ca2+ responses of a large series of individual islets, monitored by digital image analysis and perifused at both 3 and 10 mM glucose, indicated that the rise in glucose concentration caused more than a doubling of the average cytosolic free Ca2+ value and a 4-fold increase in the amplitude of the oscillations with little change in period. The pattern of Ca2+ change within the islets was consistent with recruitment of responding cells. The coexistence of oscillations with similar periods in insulin secretion, oxygen consumption, and cytosolic free Ca2+ is consistent with the model of metabolically driven pulsatile insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1516216944,"The chemotactic responses of bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium are mediated by phosphorylation of the CheY protein. Phospho-CheY interacts with the flagellar motor switch to cause tumbly behavior. CheY belongs to a large family of phosphorylated response regulators that function in bacteria to control motility and regulate gene expression. Residues corresponding to Asp57, Asp13, and Lys109 in CheY are highly conserved among all of these proteins. The site of phosphorylation in CheY is Asp57, and in the three-dimensional structure of CheY the Asp57 carboxylate side chain is in close proximity to the beta-carboxylate of Asp13 and the epsilon-amin of Lys109. To further examine the roles of these residues in response regulator function, each has been mutated to a conservative substitution. Asn for Asp and Arg for Lys. All mutations abolished CheY function in vivo. Whereas the Asp to Asn mutations dramatically reduced levels of CheY phosphorylation, the Lys to Arg mutation had the opposite effect. The high level of phosphorylation in the Lys109 mutant results from a decreased autophosphatase activity as well as a lack of phosphatase stimulation by the phosphatase activating protein, CheZ. Despite its high level of phosphorylation, the Lys109 mutant protein cannot produce tumbly behavior. Thus, Lys109 is required for an event subsequent to phosphorylation. We propose that an interaction between the epsilon-amino of Lys109 and the phosphoryl group at Asp57 is essential for the conformational switch that leads to activation of CheY."
https://openalex.org/W2045359784,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes are coordinately regulated and show tissue-specific expression. With the use of in vivo footprinting, common promoter sites in these genes were found to be occupied only in cells that expressed the genes, in spite of the presence of the promoter binding proteins. In vivo analysis of mutant cell lines that exhibited coordinate loss of class II MHC expression, including several from individuals with bare lymphocyte syndrome, revealed two in vivo phenotypes. One suggests a defect in gene activation, whereas the other suggests a defect in promoter accessibility."
https://openalex.org/W1593983451,"Abstract Membrane localization of p21ras is dependent upon its posttranslational modification by a 15-carbon farnesyl group. The isoprenoid is linked to a cysteine located within a conserved carboxyl-terminal sequence termed the box (where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid). We now show that three GTP-binding proteins encoded by the recently identified rac1, rac2, and ralA genes also undergo isoprenoid modification. cDNAs coding for each protein were transcribed in vitro, and the RNAs were translated in reticulocyte lysates. Incorporation of isoprenoid precursors, [3H]mevalonate or [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate, indicated that the translation products were modified by isoprenyl groups. A protein recognized by an antibody to rac1 also comigrated with a protein metabolically labeled by a product of [3H] mevalonate in cultured cells. Gel permeation chromatography of radiolabeled hydrocarbons released from the rac1, rac2, and ralA proteins by reaction with Raney nickel catalyst indicated that unlike p21Hras, which was modified by a 15-carbon moiety, the rac and ralA translation products were modified by 20-carbon isoprenyl groups. Site-directed mutagenesis established that the isoprenylated cysteines in the rac1, rac2, and ralA proteins were located in the fourth position from the carboxyl terminus. The three-amino acid extension distal to the cysteine was required for this modification. The isoprenylation of rac1 (CSLL), ralA (CCIL), and the site-directed mutants rac1 (CRLL) and ralA (CSIL), demonstrates that the amino acid adjacent to the cysteine need not be aliphatic. Therefore, proteins with carboxyl-terminal CXXX sequences that depart from the CAAX motif should be considered as potential targets for isoprenoid modification."
https://openalex.org/W1548397968,"The recent availability of pure lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from Mycobacterium spp. has resulted in its implication in host-parasite interaction, which events may be mediated by the presence of a phosphatidylinositol unit at the reducing end of LAM. Herein we address the structure of the antigenic, nonreducing end of the molecule. Through the process of 13C NMR analysis of the whole molecule and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of alditol acetates derived from the differential per-O-alkylated lipopolysaccharide, the majority of the arabinosyl residues were recognized as furanosides. Second, through analysis of per-O-alkylated oligoarabinosyl arabinitol fragments of partially hydrolyzed LAM, it was established that the internal segments of the arabinan component consists of branched 3,5-linked alpha-D-arabinofuranosyl (Araf) units with stretches of linear 5-linked alpha-D-Araf residues attached at both branch positions, whereas the nonreducing terminal segments of LAM consist of either of the two arrangements, beta-D-Araf-(1----2)-alpha-D-Araf-(1----5)- alpha-D-Araf---- or [beta-D-Araf-(1----2)-alpha-D-Araf-(1----]2---- (3 and 5)-alpha-D-Araf----. Since this latter arrangement also characterizes the terminal segments of the peptidoglycan-bound arabinogalactan of Mycobacterium spp., we propose that mycobacteria elaborate unique terminal arabinan motifs in two distinct settings. In the case of the bound arabinogalactan, these motifs provide the nucleus for the esterified mycolic acids, entities which dominate the physicochemical features of mycobacteria and their peculiar pathogenesis. In the case of LAM, these motifs, non-mycolylated, are the dominant B-cell antigens responsible for the majority of the copious antibody response evident in most mycobacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W1563717395,"The nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa algC gene encoding phosphomannomutase (PMM; EC 5.4.2.8) was determined. The codon usage in algC in the wobble base position was 90.4% G+C, typical of Pseudomonas genes. The predicted amino acid sequence of phosphomannomutase (PMM) showed homology over a stretch of 112 amino acids in the carboxyl terminus with rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase (PGM), an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction analogous to that catalyzed by PMM. In addition, a specific amino acid sequence within PMM showed homology with the catalytic site of PGM. DNA sequence analysis of a defective algC gene (algC') cloned from a mutant of P. aeruginosa that lacked PMM activity revealed one point mutation (a C to T transition) in the carboxyl terminus of PMM which resulted in an amino acid change from arginine 420 to cysteine 420. The mutation identified in the algC' gene was not within the regions of homology with PGM. The algC promoter showed significant homology with the promoters of two other P. aeruginosa genes involved in alginate synthesis, algD and algR1. Both the algD and algR1 promoters are activated by the product of the algR1 gene in P. aeruginosa. The upstream region of the algC gene contained a sequence identical to the algD upstream sequence that is known to be the binding site for the AlgR1 protein. Expression of algC was reduced 5.7-fold in an algR1 mutant of P. aeruginosa compared to its isogenic parent strain (lacking the algR1 mutation), suggesting that the algR1 gene product activates the transcription of the algC gene."
https://openalex.org/W1673140014,"Hormone-induced oscillations of the free intracellular calcium concentration are thought to be relevant for frequency encoding of hormone signals. In liver cells, such Ca2+ oscillations occur in response to stimulation by hormones acting via phosphoinositide breakdown. This observation may be explained by cooperative, positive feedback of Ca2+ on its own release from one inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive pool, obviating oscillations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The kinetic rate laws of the associated model have a mathematical structure reminiscent of the Brusselator, a hypothetical chemical model involving a rather improbable trimolecular reaction step, thus giving a realistic biological interpretation to this hallmark of dissipative structures. We propose that calmodulin is involved in mediating this cooperativity and positive feedback, as suggested by the presented experiments. For one, hormone-induced calcium oscillations can be inhibited by the (nonphenothiazine) calmodulin antagonists calmidazolium or CGS 9343 B. Alternatively, in cells overstimulated by hormone, as characterized by a non-oscillatory elevated Ca2+ concentration, these antagonists could again restore sustained calcium oscillations. The experimental observations, including modulation of the oscillations by extracellular calcium, were in qualitative agreement with the predictions of our mathematical model."
https://openalex.org/W1533809089,"Marine Synechococcus strains WH8103, WH8020, and WH7803 each possess two different phycoerythrins, PE(II) and PE(I), in a weight ratio of 2-4:1. PE(II) and PE(I) differ in amino acid sequence and in bilin composition and content. Studies with strain WH7803 indicated that both PE(II) and PE(I) were present in the same phycobilisome rod substructures and that energy absorbed by PE(II) was transferred to PE(I). Strain WH8103 and WH8020 PE(I)s carried five bilin chromophores thioether-linked to cysteine residues in sequences homologous to those previously characterized in C-, B-, and R-PEs. In contrast, six bilins were attached to strain WH8103 and WH8020 PE(II)s. Five of these were at positions homologous to bilin attachment sites in other phycoerythrins. The additional bilin attachment site was on the alpha subunit. The locations and bilin types in these PE(s) and in the marine Synechocystis strain WH8501 PE(I) (Swanson, R. V., Ong, L. J., Wilbanks, S. M., and Glazer, A. N. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9528-9534) are: (table; see text) Since phycourobilin (PUB) (lambda max approximately 495 nm) transfers energy to phycoerythrobilin (PEB) (lambda max approximately 550 nm), inspection of these data shows that the invariant PEB group at beta-82 is the terminal energy acceptor in phycoerythrins. The adaptations to blue-green light, high PUB content and the presence of an additional bilin on the alpha subunit, increase the efficiency of light absorption by PE(II)s at approximately 500 nm."
https://openalex.org/W2054537734,"Gold conjugates have been used to quantitate human transferrin receptors (hTfnRs) on transfected chick embryo fibroblasts. No relationship could be found between the number of hTfnRs and the number of clathrincoated pits. However, hTfnRs are also associated with flat clathrin lattices that lie outside invaginated pits. With increasing levels of receptor expression, the density of hTfnRs within flat lattices increases, and at the highest levels of expression the total area of flat lattice increases up to 3-fold. These results show that increased receptor numbers can promote clathrin lattice growth and suggest that the recruitment of receptors like hTfnRs is an essential step in lattice construction. We conclude that the process of invagination, which gives rise to coated pits, is regulated separately."

https://openalex.org/W1760784063,"The Pro-Thr box is a linker of 23 amino acids ((PT)4T(PT)7) connecting the catalytic domain and the cellulose-binding domain (CBD) of endoglucanase A (CenA) from the bacterium Cellulomonas fimi. Deletion of the Pro-Thr box alters the conformation of CenA by changing the relative orientation of the catalytic domain and the CBD. The tertiary structures of the catalytic domain and the CBD appear to be unchanged. The change in conformation reduces the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme and masks one of two protease-sensitive sites between the domains. The deletion does not affect the adsorption of the enzyme to microcrystalline cellulose, but it does affect its desorption from cellulose. The results suggest that the Pro-Thr box in CenA has an extended, kinked, and rigid conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1598352138,"Lipid modifications that may be introduced into several subunits of G proteins were explored by in vitro translation of recombinant mRNAs in reticulocyte lysates. In agreement with studies by others, myristic acid was incorporated into alpha i's and alpha o, but not alpha s, beta, or gamma's. In contrast, mevalonate (Mev) was incorporated only into gamma-subunits. Both, the gamma-subunit of transducin (gamma T) and that of other G proteins (gamma G) were modified by the lysates but with different characteristics. Labeled gamma T was unstable and was rapidly proteolyzed. Labeled gamma G was stable. The Mev-derivative in gamma G was sensitive to methyliodide and, after cleavage and chromatographic analysis, comigrated with the C20 polyisoprenol geranylgeraniol. This indicated that gamma G had been geranylgeranylated and that this polyisoprenoid was attached to the protein through a thioether linkage. It is thought that polyisoprenylation is defined by the COOH-terminal sequence Cys-A-A-X, where A is an aliphatic acid and X is any amino acid. Replacement by mutation of the Cys of the COOH-terminal -Cys-Ala-Ile-Leu sequence of gamma G with Ser abolished Mev incorporation, suggesting this Cys as the site of attachment of the geranylgeranyl moiety. Yet, Mev incorporation was less than 10% as much into gamma G with the Cys-A-A-X sequence -Cys-Ala-Ile-Trp. Consistent with geranylgeranylation, the C15 farnesyl moiety of farnesyl pyrophosphate was not incorporated into gamma G unless the incubations were fortified with Mev. In contrast, the farnesyl moiety was incorporated in an Mev-independent manner into gamma T (COOH terminus: -Cys-Val-Ile-Ser) and c-Ha-ras (COOH terminus: -Cys-Val-Leu-Ser) which are both farnesylated rather than geranylgeranylated. Thus, 1) separate enzymes appear to be involved in transferring farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups to proteins, 2) structural factors other than the CAAX box contribute to the activity of the polyisoprenylating enzymes, and 3) this type of lipidation may be part of a proteolytic signaling system. Polyisoprenylation, which increases hydrophobicity of the derivatized protein, may play a role in anchoring not only ras but also G proteins to membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1580812515,"Signal transducing G proteins, such as transducin, are prenylated and methylated at carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues. The methylation of transducin occurs by means of a membrane bound S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methyltransferase. This methyltransferase accepts the simple modified amino acid N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-L-cysteine (AFC) as a substrate. This means that the enzyme does not require peptide sequences of transducin in a putative substrate. Moreover, small structural changes in the AFC structural unit all lead to molecules incapable of being substrates. For example, neither N-acetyl-S-farnesylhomocysteine (AFHC) nor the saturated form of AFC are substrates. Interestingly, substitution of the N-acetyl moiety of AFC with a hydrogen atom leads to S-farnesylthiopropionic acid (FTP), which is an excellent substrate for the methyltransferase. The methyltransferase shows great specificity for the the FTP pharmacophore. So far, alterations in this structure have not led to active substrates. For example, removal of a methylene group of FTP, producing S-farnesylthioacetic acid (FTA), abolished substrate activity. FTA is a potent competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. FTP is thus the ultimately simplified substrate for the methyltransferase and does not contain any remnants of the peptide structure of transducin."
https://openalex.org/W1584937107,"Abstract The structure of human lipoprotein lipase was recently deduced from its cDNA sequence. It contains 8 serine residues (residues 45, 132, 143, 172, 193, 244, 251, and 363) that are absolutely conserved in both lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase across all species studied. The high homology between lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, and pancreatic lipase suggests that the catalytic functions of these enzymes share a common mechanism and that one of the 8 conserved serines in human lipoprotein lipase must play a catalytic role as does serine 152 in the case of pancreatic lipase (Winkler, F. K., D'Arcy, A., and Hunziker, W. Nature 343, 771-774). We expressed wild-type and site-specific mutants of human lipoprotein lipase in COS cells in vitro. We produced two to four substitution mutants involving each of the 8 serines and assayed a total of 22 mutants for both enzyme activity and the amount of immunoreactive enzyme mass produced. Immunoreactive lipase was detected in all cases. With the exception of Ser132, for each of the 8 serine mutants we studied, at least one of several mutants at each position showed detectable enzyme activity. All three substitution mutants at Ser132, Ser----Thr, Ser----Ala, and Ser----Asp, were totally inactive. Ser132 occurs in the consensus sequence Gly-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Gly present in all serine proteinases and in human pancreatic lipase. The x-ray crystallography structure of human pancreatic lipase suggests that the analogous serine residue in human pancreatic lipase, Ser152, is the nucleophilic residue essential for catalysis. Our biochemical data strongly support the conclusion that Ser132 in human lipoprotein lipase is the crucial residue required for enzyme catalysis. The observed specific activities of the variants involving the other seven highly conserved serines in human lipoprotein lipase are consistent with the interpretation that this enzyme has a three-dimensional structure very similar to that of human pancreatic lipase."

https://openalex.org/W1631876630,"Rainbow trout macrophages maintained in short term culture when incubated with either calcium ionophore, A23187, or opsonized zymosan synthesize a range of lipoxygenase products including lipoxins and leukotrienes. These cells are unusual in that they generate more lipoxin than leukotriene following such challenge. The main lipoxin synthesized was lipoxin (LX) A4. This compound was identified by cochromatography with authentic standard during reversephase high performance liquid chromatography, by ultra violet spectral analysis, radiolabeling following incorporation of [14C]arachidonic acid substrate into macrophage phospholipids, and gas chromatography electron impact mass spectrometry of the methyl ester, trimethylsilyl ether derivative. Other 4-series lipoxins synthesized by trout macrophages were identified as 11-trans-LXA4, 7-cis-11-trans-LXA4, and 6(S)-LXA4. These cells also produced 5-series lipoxins tentatively identified as LXA5, 11-trans-LXA5 and possibly 6(S)-LXA5. No LXB4 or LXB5 was, however, detected. The dynamics of leukotriene and lipoxin release were also determined. Lipoxin generation was slower than leukotriene generation the latter reaching a maximum after 30 min of exposure to ionophore (5 microM, 18 degrees C) compared with 45 min for the former."
https://openalex.org/W1576321072,"Pyruvate is a minor product of the reaction catalyzed by ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from spinach leaves. Labeled pyruvate was detected, in addition to the major labeled product, 3-phosphoglycerate, when 14CO2 was the substrate. Pyruvate production was also measured spectrophotometrically in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase and NADH. The Km for CO2 of the pyruvate-producing activity was 12.5 microM, similar to the CO2 affinity of the 3-phosphoglycerate-producing activity. No pyruvate was detected by the coupled assay when ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate was replaced by 3-phosphoglycerate or when the carboxylase was inhibited by the reaction-intermediate analog, 2'-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. Therefore, pyruvate was not being produced from 3-phosphoglycerate by contaminant enzymes. The ratio of pyruvate produced to ribulose bisphosphate consumed at 25 degrees C was 0.7%, and this ratio was not altered by varying pH or CO2 concentration or by substituting Mn2+ for Mg2+ as the catalytically essential metal. The ratio increased with increasing temperature. Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylases from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 6301 and the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum also catalyzed pyruvate formation and to the same extent as the spinach enzyme. When the reaction was carried out in 2H2O, the spinach carboxylase increased the proportion of its product partitioned to pyruvate to 2.2%. These observations provide evidence that the C-2 carbanion form of 3-phosphoglycerate is an intermediate in the catalytic sequence of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase. Pyruvate is formed by beta elimination of a phosphate ion from a small portion of this intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1672298021,"A new isoenzyme of carbonic anhydrase has been isolated and purified from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This carbonic anhydrase is composed of two nonidentical subunits with apparent molecular masses of 39 and 4.5 kDa and is located in the periplasmic space. This is the second periplasmic carbonic anhydrase found in C. reinhardtii. Two genes, CAH1 and CAH2, which code for carbonic anhydrase, have been recently described by Fujiwara et al. (Fujiwara, S., Fukuzawa, H., Tachiki, A., and Miyachi, S. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U.S.A. 87, 9779-9783). The CAH1 gene codes for a periplasmic carbonic anhydrase which is induced under low CO2 conditions and is well characterized. The carbonic anhydrase characterized in this report was isolated from a mutant that is unable to synthesize the CAH1 gene product. Amino acid sequencing demonstrates that this newly isolated carbonic anhydrase is the CAH2 gene product. This is the first report of another functional carbonic anhydrase in C. reinhardtii."
https://openalex.org/W1597557725,"A dual plasmid system was used to examine the protein and acyl-CoA specificities of Saccharomyces cerevisiae myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) by co-expressing it in Escherichia coli with each of four homologous alpha subunits of the signal-transducing, heterotrimeric G proteins. Exogenous [3H]myristate was incorporated into rat Gi alpha 1 and rat Go alpha but not into bovine Gs alpha or human Gz alpha. Oxygen for methylene group substitutions in myristate result in analogs with comparable chain length and stereochemistry but marked reductions in hydrophobicity. Metabolic labeling studies with 6-, 11-, or 13-[3H]oxatetradecanoic acid indicated that they were incorporated into rat Gi alpha 1 and Go alpha with an efficiency that could be correlated with their accumulation into E. coli and their interactions with purified NMT in vitro. Octapeptides derived from the NH2-terminal sequences of these four G alpha polypeptides were tested as substrates for purified S. cerevisiae NMT. None were bound by the enzyme. Acidic residues at positions 7 and 8 appear to contribute to this effect; deletion of these two amino acids or addition of the next 9 residues of rat Go alpha produced active substrates. These results imply that productive interactions between NMT and G alpha protein substrates in vivo require structural features that are not fully represented within their NH2-terminal 8 residues."
https://openalex.org/W1601647648,"We have demonstrated the presence of a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the Ras-related Ral A protein in the cytosolic fraction of brain and testis. This protein, designated Ral-GAP, was distinguished from Ras-GAP by its behavior in two chromatography systems and by the fact that the two GAP proteins did not stimulate the GTPase activity of each others target GTP binding proteins. The lack of effect of Ral-GAP on Ras GTPase activity also distinguished it from the product of the neurofibromatosis gene NF-1. Ral-GAP also differed from Rho-GAP and Rap-GAP by virtue of its elution from a gel filtration column with proteins of Mr greater than 10(6). This was likely an overestimate of the protein's molecular mass, however, since it sedimented in sucrose gradients between standard proteins of 150 and 443 kDa. Ral-GAP failed to promote the GTPase activity of mutant Ral proteins containing amino acid substitutions that in Ras lead to GAP-insensitive proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1493369329,"A survey of marine unicellular cyanobacterial strains for phycobiliproteins with high phycourobilin (PUB) content led to a detailed investigation of Synechocystis sp. WH8501. The phycobiliproteins of this strain were purified and characterized with respect to their bilin composition and attachment sites. Amino-terminal sequences were determined for the alpha and beta subunits of the phycocyanin and the major and minor phycoerythrins. The amino acid sequences around the attachment sites of all bilin prosthetic groups of the phycocyanin and of the minor phycoerythrin were also determined. The phycocyanin from this strain carries a single PUB on the alpha subunit and two phycocyanobilins on the beta subunit. It is the only phycocyanin known to carry a PUB chromophore. The native protein, isolated in the (alpha beta)2 aggregation state, displays absorption maxima at 490 and 592 nm. Excitation at 470 nm, absorbed almost exclusively by PUB, leads to emission at 644 nm from phycocyanobilin. The major and minor phycoerythrins from strain WH8501 each carry five bilins per alpha beta unit, four PUBs and one phycoerythrobilin. Spectroscopic properties determine that the PUB groups function as energy donors to the sole phycoerythrobilin. Analysis of the bilin peptides unambiguously identifies the phycoerythrobilin at position beta-82 (residue numbering assigned by homology with B-phycoerythrin; Sidler, W., Kumpf, B., Suter, F., Klotz, A.

The [3H]galactose- or [14C]mannose-labeled product was (i) cleaved by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; (ii) deaminated by nitrous acid; and (iii) degraded into radioactive, low molecular weight fragments upon hydrolysis with mild acid. Analysis of the products of mild acid hydrolysis revealed the presence of phosphorylated Gal-beta-Man as the major fragment with lesser amounts of mono-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides. The incorporation of the two isotopic precursors was neither stimulated by the addition of dolichylphosphate nor inhibited by amphomycin, indicating that dolichol-saccharide intermediates are not involved in assembly of the repeating units of lipophosphoglycan. Development of this cell-free glycosylating system will facilitate further studies on the pathway and enzymes involved in lipophosphoglycan biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1545467541,"Cholera toxin exerts its effects on cells in large part through the ADP-ribosylation of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. Toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation is enhanced by approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins termed ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which are allosteric activators of the toxin catalytic unit. Rabbit antiserum against a purified bovine brain ARF (sARF II) reacted on immunoblots with two approximately 20-kDa ARF-like proteins (sARF I and II) in tissue extracts from bovine, rat, frog, and chicken. Levels of ARF were higher in brain than in non-neural tissues. In rat brain, on the second postnatal day, amounts of sARF I and II were similar. By the 10th postnatal day and thereafter, sARF II predominated. Relative levels of ARF determined by immunoreactivity were in agreement with levels assessed in functional assays of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. Based on nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of human and bovine cDNAs, there appear to be at least six different ARF-like genes. Northern blots of rat brain poly(A)+ RNA were hybridized with cDNA and oligonucleotide probes specific for each of the human and bovine ARF genes. From the second to the 27th postnatal day, ARF 3 mRNA increased, whereas mRNAs for ARFs 2 and 4 decreased; and those for ARFs 1, 5, and 6 were apparently unchanged. Partial amino acid sequence of sARF II is consistent with it being either the ARF 1 or 3 gene product. The developmental changes in rat brain ARF parallel neuronal maturation and synapse formation."

Previous experiments have identified the head as the location from which per exerts its effect on circadian rhythms. To localize further this region and to examine the effects of altered levels and altered spatial expression patterns of the per gene on circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, we have characterized transformed lines containing per gene constructs missing substantial cis-acting regulatory information. The data suggest that wild-type levels of per gene expression are necessary in only a small fraction of the nervous system for near wild-type periods, whereas a larger fraction of per-expressing cells in the brain contributes to the strength of the circadian rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W1550571528,"Rapid stimulation of c-fos transcription by many agonists requires the serum response element (SRE), which binds at least two distinct nuclear proteins, p67SRF and p62TCF. Using nuclear protein extracts from 1321-N1 human astrocytoma cells, we investigated ligand-induced changes in binding of these proteins to SRE probes. In these cells c-fos mRNA expression can be induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) through protein kinase C-independent pathways and by phorbol esters through protein kinase C. We detected two DNA-protein complexes that formed specifically with the SRE (bands 1 and 2). Band 2 formation was increased 4-6 min after stimulation with EGF as well as serum and phorbol esters; this peaked at 10-30 min and returned to basal levels by 60 min. Induction of band 2 formation preceded the onset and peak accumulation of c-fos mRNA (15 and 30 min after EGF stimulation, respectively) and its return to basal levels (by 1-2 h). Band 2 formation was also increased A431 cells stimulated with EGF and in HeLa and Swiss-3T3 cells stimulated with serum. We found that band 1 contained p67SRF bound to the SRE; band 2 contained p67SRF and a second protein. Gel shift analyses using [35S]methionine-labeled p67SRF and nonradioactive DNA probes suggested that hormone treatment most likely modified the second protein component of band 2. Transient transfection of 1321-N1 cells with plasmids containing point mutations that prevented band 2 formation in vitro also abolished induction of c-fos transcription in vivo as assayed by RNase protection analysis. Thus, hormone-stimulated formation of the protein-DNA complex represented by band 2 may be involved in the activation of c-fos transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1506102146,"We examined the effect of cellular aging on adult mortality and hsp70 gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster under thermal stress. The results showed that flies exposed to 37 degrees C for various time intervals had reduced survival rate with age. The level of hsp70 mRNA increases in flies up to 23-28 days of age, but then declines as they get older. When flies are shifted to 25 degrees C after 30 min of heat stress, the time-dependent decrease in hsp70 mRNA levels occurs more rapidly in young flies than in old ones. The hsp70 mRNA present during this recovery period is translated into protein, and senescent flies continue to synthesize this protein for up to 5 h after heat shock. The prolonged expression of hsp70 RNA during recovery from heat shock was also observed in young flies fed canavanine, an arginine analogue. These data suggest that in old insects, the accumulation of conformationally altered proteins plays a role in the regulation of hsp70 RNA expression. These results are discussed in relation to the finding that old flies are more sensitive to thermal stress than young ones."
https://openalex.org/W1483633222,"The assembly of fibronectin into disulfide cross-linked extracellular matrices requires the interaction of mesenchymal cells with two distinct sites on fibronectin, the Arg-Gly-Asp cell adhesive site and an amino-terminal site contained within the first five type I homologous repeats (Quade, B. J., and McDonald, J. A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 19602-19609). Proteolytically derived 29-kDa fragments of fibronectin (29kDa) containing these repeats bind to monolayers of cultured fibroblasts and inhibit fibronectin matrix assembly. The cell surface molecules interacting with fibronectin's 29-kDa matrix assembly domain have resisted purification using conventional methods such as affinity chromatography. Accordingly, in order to identify molecules which bind this fragment, 125I-labeled 29kDa was allowed to bind to fibroblast monolayers and chemically cross-linked to the cell surface with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate. Extraction of the cross-linked cell layer yielded radiolabeled complexes of 56, 150, and 280 kDa. Formation of these cross-linked complexes was specifically inhibited by the addition of excess unlabeled 29kDa but was unaffected by the presence of fibronectin fragments containing other type I repeats outside of the 29kDa matrix assembly domain. The cross-linked complexes were insoluble in nondenaturing detergents but soluble when denatured and reduced, suggesting that 29kDa may be cross-linked to components of the pericellular matrix. Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked cell extracts with a polyclonal antibody to fibronectin that does not recognize the amino terminus demonstrate that the 280-kDa band contains 29kDa cross-linked to fibronectin present on the cell surface. Formation of the 150-kDa complex was inhibited by EDTA, suggesting that divalent cations are required for its formation. Although the molecular mass and divalent cation requirement suggest that the 150-kDa complex may be related to an integrin, this complex was not immunoprecipitated by polyclonal antibodies generated to the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin fibronectin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1517887030,"The genes for the alpha and beta subunits of a novel six bilin-bearing (class II) phycoerythrin were cloned from Synechococcus sp. WH8020 and sequenced. The cloned genes (mpeA and mpeB) were detected by homology with the genes for C-phycoerythrin from Pseudanabaena sp. PCC7409. The mpe locus occurs once in the genome and is arranged similarly to that of many other phycobiliproteins, with mpeA shortly 3' of mpeB. Sequence comparison suggests that this phycoerythrin (and perhaps all class II phycoerythrins) occupy a branch of the phycoerythrin family separate from five-chromophore per alpha beta (class I) phycoerythrins, C-phycoerythrin, and B-phycoerythrin. The position of the sixth chromophore of the class II phycoerythrin of WH8020 was determined by comparison of the amino acid sequence of the chromopeptides (Ong, L. J., and Glazer, A. N. (1991) J. Biol Chem. 266, 9515-9527) with the sequence deduced from the gene. This located the chromophore at residue 75 of the alpha subunit, very close to the alpha-83 chromophore in the primary structure and, presumably, in the three-dimensional structure."
https://openalex.org/W1514624777,"delta-Aminolevulinic acid is the universal precursor for all tetrapyrroles including hemes, chlorophylls, and bilins. In plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and many other bacteria, delta-aminolevulinic acid is synthesized from glutamate in a reaction sequence that requires three enzymes, ATP, NADPH, and tRNA(Glu). The three enzymes have been characterized as glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, glutamyl-tRNA reductase, and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase. All three enzymes have been separated and partially characterized from plants and algae. In prokaryotic phototrophs, only the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase have been decribed. We report here the purification and some properties of the glutamyl-tRNA reductase from extracts of the unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The glutamyl-tRNA reductase has been purified over 370-fold to apparent homogeneity. Its native molecular mass was determined to be 350 kDa by glycerol density gradient centrifugation, and its subunit size was estimated to be 39 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined for 42 residues. Much higher activity occurred with NADPH than with NADH as the reduced pyridine nucleotide substrate. Half-maximal rates occurred at 5 microM NADPH, whereas saturation was not reached even at 10 mM NADH. Purified Synechocystis glutamyl-tRNA reductase was inhibited 50% by 5 microM heme. Activity was unaffected by 10 microM 3-amino-2,3-dihydrobenzoic acid. No flavin, pyridine nucleotide, or other light-absorbing prosthetic group was detected on the purified enzyme. The catalytic turnover number of purified Synechocystis glutamyl-tRNA reductase is comparable to those of prokaryotic and plastidic glutamyl-tRNA synthetases."
https://openalex.org/W1530515761,"The post-translational poly ADP-ribosylation of proteins by the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (EC 2.4.2.30) involves a complex pattern of ADP-ribose polymers. We have determined how this enzyme produces the various polymer size patterns responsible for altered protein function. The results show that histone H1 and core histones are potent regulators of both the numbers and sizes of ADP-ribose polymers. Each histone induced the polymerase to synthesize a specific polymer size pattern. Various other basic and/or DNA binding proteins as well as other known stimulators of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (spermine, MgCl2, nicked DNA) were ineffective as polymer size modulators. Testing specific proteolytic fragments of histone H1, the polymer number and polymer size modulating activity could be mapped to specific polypeptide domains. The results suggest that histones specifically regulate the polymer termination reaction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1522675378,"Addition of A23187 plus EDTA to rat liver mitochondria induces a common uniport pathway for monovalent cations. In this study, we have carried out a detailed characterization of the flow/force relationship for K+ transport along this pathway under steady state conditions. In the presence of EDTA, the K+ conductance is a linear function of external K+ in the range 0-20 mM K+, with a slope of 0.15 nmol of K+ x mg of protein-1 x min-1 x mV-1. The K+ conductance is inhibited by Mg2+ in the range 10(-9)-10(-6) M, while K+ flux is stimulated by the sulfhydryl group reagent mersalyl. Uniport activity can be detected in native mitochondria. These findings are compatible with the notion that electrophoretic K+ flux across the inner membrane takes place via a regulated K+ uniport with the potential of transporting K+ at rates in excess of 600 nmol x mg of protein-1 x min-1."
https://openalex.org/W1559766936,"In vivo implants of demineralized dentin matrix into muscle induce the formation of bone within the muscle. As with bone matrix implants, the bone induction appears to follow a chondrogenic pathway. Outgrowth cells from explants of neonatal rat muscle respond to bone matrix, in vitro, by expressing a heightened synthesis of sulfated proteoglycans and type II collagen, phenotypic of cartilage. The in vitro cell culture system has been used as an assay to monitor the isolation of the factor responsible for expression of this phenotypic transformation. Soluble proteins extracted from rat incisor dentin matrix during demineralization with EDTA, and not precipitable with 1.0 M CaCl2, were active in the in vitro system. The active extract was fractionated by Sephacryl S-100 chromatography in 6 M guanidine HCl, isoelectric focusing in Immobilines, and by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. All fractions were assayed for activity at every stage. The final active fraction from the reverse phase chromatography on a Zorbax Poly-F column was purified to homogeneity, and yielded a single spot on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The component, RP-4, had pI 5.4-5.5, and an apparent Mr 6,000-10,000, based on globular protein standards. Maximal activity with respect to both sulfate incorporation into proteoglycan and production of type II collagen was in the 1.0-10 ng/ml range. The RP-4 had a unique amino-terminal amino sequence and was rich in Gly, Pro, Glx, and Ala residues. It was different from transforming growth factor-beta and the bone morphogenetic protein family of proteins in these essential features."
https://openalex.org/W1535048478,"Abstract An unknown immunogenic glycopeptidolipid, named GPL X-1, was isolated from Mycobacterium xenopi, which is a nontuberculous mycobacterium responsible for pulmonary and disseminated infectious diseases mainly occurring immunocompromised patients. The glycopeptidolipid was purified until homogeneity, the native form, by direct phase high performance liquid chromatography. A new route is proposed for the structural elucidation of its unusual lipopeptidic core. The presence of allothreonine (aThr), phenylalanine, and serine the molecular ratio 1:1:2, respectively, was established by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the phenylthiocarbamyl amino acid derivatives. From the molecular mass (1828 Da) of the native glycopeptidolipid, determined by cesium ion liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry using the amphipathic triethylene glycol monobutyl ether matrix, it was deduced that the tetrapeptide was amidified by a dodecanoic acid. The complete structure, C12-Ser-Ser-Phe-aThr-OCH3, of the lipopeptidic core was established by pyrolysis electron impact-mass spectrometry of the native glycopeptidolipid. To date, this is the first example of a mycobacterial glycopeptidolipid with a C12-tetrapeptidic core containing serine. A novel approach, based on two dimensional 1H,1H correlated spectroscopy analysis of the native and peracetylated GPL X-1, was developed, allowing the structural determination of the monosaccharidic residues with their alkali-labile groups in situ on the whole complex molecule. 2-O-Acyl-alpha-L-Rhap, alpha-L-Rhap, 2,4-di-O-acyl-6-deoxy-alpha-L-Glcp, 2,3,4-tri-O-Me-alpha-L-Rhap, and 3-O-Me-6-deoxy-alpha-L-Talp were identified, where Me, Rhap, and Talp are methyl, rhamnopyranosyl, and talopyranosyl, respectively. The latter two were localized at the carbohydrate non-reducing ends, and the C-3's of the remaining monosaccharide residues were found involved the interglycosidic linkage. The alpha anomeric configurations were inferred from the JC-1,H-1 heteronuclear coupling constants, and the L absolute configurations for all the monosaccharide residues were established by gas chromatography analysis of the trimethylsilyl (+/-)-2-butyl glycosides. Finally, by pyrolysis electron impact mass spectrometry of peracetylated GPL X-1, the following tetrasaccharide appendage structure was proposed: 2,3,4-tri-O-Me-L-Rhap(alpha 1----3)-2-O-lauryl-L-Rhap(alpha 1----3)-L-Rhap- (alpha 1----3)-2,4-di-O-(acetyl,lauryl)-6-deoxy-alpha-L-Glcp. Compared to the oligosaccharidic glycopeptidolipid structures, the particular features of the GPL X-1 tetrasaccharide structure arise from the presence of monosaccharide residues esterified by C12 fatty acids and from the absence of the basal disaccharide core, L-Rhap-(alpha 1----2)-6-deoxy-alpha-L-Talp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1663202091,"This study explores the catalytic and allosteric roles of a flexible loop in tryptophan synthase. Trypsin is known to cleave the tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex in an alpha subunit loop at Arg-188. Cleavage yields an active alpha 2 beta 2 derivative. The new results provide evidence that the alpha subunit loop serves two important roles: substrate binding and communicating the effects of substrate binding to the beta subunit. A role for the loop in substrate binding is supported by our finding that addition of a substrate analogue of the alpha subunit, alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate, decreases the rate of cleavage by trypsin. An allosteric role for the loop is supported by the finding although the native alpha 2 beta 2 complex is strongly inhibited by alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate, the nicked alpha 2 beta 2 complex is desensitized to this inhibition. The time course of proteolysis in the presence and absence of alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate is followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and by assays of activity in the presence and absence of alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate. We use spectroscopic measurements of the pyridoxal phosphate-L-tryptophan intermediates at the active site of the beta subunit to determine the affinity of the native and nicked enzymes for L-tryptophan and alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate. Although cleavage alters the equilibrium distribution of intermediates and reduces the affinity for alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate, it has little effect on the affinity for amino acids bound to the beta subunit. We conclude that the loop in the alpha subunit is important for ligand binding and for communicating the effects of ligand binding from the alpha subunit to the beta subunit in the alpha 2 beta 2 complex."
https://openalex.org/W196209176,"A high molecular weight chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (Mr 240,000) is released from platelet surface during aggregation induced by several pharmacological agents. Some details on the structure of this compound are reported. beta-Elimination with alkali and borohydride produces chondroitin sulfate chains with a molecular weight of 40,000. The combined results indicate a proteoglycan molecule containing 5-6 chondroitin sulfate chains and a protein core rich in serine and glycine residues. Degradation with chondroitinase AC shows that a 4-sulfated disaccharide is the only disaccharide released from this chondroitin sulfate, characterizing it as a chondroitin 4-sulfate homopolymer. It is shown that this proteoglycan inhibits the aggregation of platelets induced by ADP. Analysis of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans not released during aggregation revealed the presence of a heparan sulfate in the platelets. Degradation by heparitinases I and II yielded the four disaccharide units of heparan sulfates: N,O-disulfated disaccharide, N-sulfated disaccharide, N-acetylated 6-sulfated disaccharide, and N-acetylated disaccharide. The possible role of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans on cell-cell interaction is discussed in view of the present findings."

Only 105 bp of proximal MT-IG 5'-flanking sequence containing a TATA box, two metal responsive elements (MREs), and three GC motifs and 147 bp of proximal MT-IF 5'-flanking sequence containing a TATCA box, four MREs, and two GC motifs were required for heavy metal-inducible expression. However, the proximal 111 bp of MT-IF 5'-flanking sequences (a TATCA box, two MREs, and two GC motifs) was not responsive to heavy metals and competes less efficiently than the 105-bp MT-IG fragment in a competition transfection analysis. The MT-IF promoter fragment containing MREc and MREd is substantially stronger and a more efficient competitor than the MT-IG promoter fragment containing MREc and MREd. Furthermore, the proximal 160 bp of MT-IG 5'-flanking sequence functions as a strong metal-inducible promoter but not as a metal-inducible enhancer. Mobility shift analysis of MT-IF and MT-IG promoter subregions suggests a correlation between protein binding to MRE sequences and MT gene expression. These data illustrate that the overall structural and functional organization of the MT-IF and MT-IG promoters are very different and that the molecular mechanisms governing differential expression levels of human MT genes are quite complex."
https://openalex.org/W1569295406,"An active site mutant bovine prothrombin cDNA (Ser528—-Ala) has been constructed, subcloned, and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The recombinant mutant prothrombin, expressed at the level of 1.5-2.0 micrograms/ml of cell medium, was fully carboxylated (9.9 +/- 0.4 mol of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid/mol of prothrombin). The mutant prothrombin could be activated to thrombin by Taipan snake venom and activated to meizothrombin by ecarin in a manner comparable to native bovine prothrombin or recombinant wild-type bovine prothrombin. The mutant meizothrombin thus formed was stable and did not autolyze. The initial rate of cleavage of mutant prothrombin catalyzed by the full prothrombinase was only 28% of the rate of cleavage of native prothrombin, while recombinant wild-type prothrombin was cleaved at the same rate as the native molecule. The mutant thrombin, obtained from the mutant prothrombin in situ by prothrombinase or Taipan snake venom activation, showed no enzymatic activity toward either fibrinogen or a synthetic chromogenic substrate, D-phenylalanyl-L-pipecolyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride (S2238). The mutant thrombin also bound dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide, a specific fluorescent inhibitor of the thrombin active site, with a weaker binding affinity (kd = 5.4 x 10(-8) M) than did native thrombin (kd = 1.7 x 10(-8) M). These results indicate that the mutant recombinant prothrombin described here is a useful tool for the study of meizothrombin or thrombin without the complications arising from the proteolytic activities of these molecules. Study of the activation of this mutant has already revealed a functional link between the site of initial cleavage by the prothrombinase and the conformation at the nascent active site of prothrombin."
