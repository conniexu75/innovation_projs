https://openalex.org/W52650613,"1. A protein which inhibits mitochondrial ATPase has been isolated from bovine heart mitochondria in pure form and its properties have been characterized. 2. To obtain inhibition it was necessary to incubate the protein with ATPase in the presence of Mg++ and ATP. The specificity of this requirement for cation and nucleotide was similar to that reported previously for ATPase activity. About 4 times as much inhibitor was required to inhibit soluble ATPase as compared to particle-bound ATPase. 3. Soluble ATPase purified from a mitochondrial extract prepared with a Nossal shaker as described previously contained considerable amounts of ATPase inhibitor. A new simple procedure for the purification of ATPase was developed starting with an extract obtained from mitochondria by sonic oscillation. A second, more complex procedure was developed starting with an extract made from submitochondrial particles that had been depleted of inhibitor. The first preparation still contained inhibitor, although less than previously described preparations. The second preparation was virtually free of inhibitor. 4. Exposure of soluble ATPase to trypsin or chymotrypsin resulted in the removal of residual inhibitor and in a slight increase in ATPase activity. This treatment abolished coupling activity although the ATPase would still bind to the particles and its activity was partially sensitive to rutamycin."

https://openalex.org/W31228972,"The antibiotic bongkrekic acid is shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of added ADP coupled with either the reactions of the respiratory chain or the dismutation of α-ketoglutarate in mammalian mitochondria. It also prevents the utilization of ATP for energy-linked cation transport and in energy dissipation by uncoupling agents. However, bongkrekic acid does not inhibit the Mg++-requiring ATPase of submitochondrial particles, the phosphorylation of endogenous ADP, or the stimulation of oxidation caused by arsenate. The ADP enhancement of the arsenate effect is prevented. These results distinguish its site of action from that of oligomycin (rutamycin), and indicate that bongkrekic acid inactivates translocation of adenine nucleotides into mitochondria. This is confirmed by measurement of the uptake of 14C-labeled adenine nucleotides. The extent of inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by bongkrekic acid shows a sigmoidal relationship to the concentration of antibiotic, which is in contrast to the linear relationship reported for atractyloside, a known inhibitor of the translocase enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1525931694,"Abstract The lipid intermediate, disaccharide (-pentapeptide)-P-P-lipid, has been isolated from Staphylococcus aureus. The lipid, moiety, like that from a similar intermediate from Micrococcus lysodeikticus, is a C55-isoprenoid alcohol. Less than 10% of the C55-isoprenoid alcohol in S. aureus is present in the form of phosphorylated derivatives. The remainder is present as the free C55-isoprenoid alcohol which has also been isolated in relatively large amounts. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the latter material indicated that it contains two internal trans double bonds, as did a similar compound isolated from M. lysodeikticus by Scher, Lennarz, and Sweeley (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 59, 1313 (1968)). It thus differs from the main component of C55-ficaprenol which contains three internal trans double bonds, and it can be separated from C55-ficaprenol by reverse phase chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1481190510,Abstract A protein with the same properties as the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP) of bovine heart mitochondria has been purified from yeast mitochondria. This protein stimulates the binding of F1 to extracted membranes by as much as 10-fold. The reconstituted particulate ATPase is inhibited by rutamycin. The yeast OSCP by itself does not form a complex with F1 nor does it confer rutamycin sensitivity on F1 in the absence of the membrane. The function of OSCP appears to be closely related to the binding of F1 to another component of the ATPase which is present in the membrane. The postribosomal supernatant of yeast cells derepressed on low concentrations of glucose in the presence of chloramphenicol has been shown to contain soluble OSCP. The amount of OSCP present in the cytoplasmic fraction is sufficient to bind all of the soluble F1 also present in this fraction. It is concluded that both OSCP and F1 are synthesized by the cytoplasmic-ribosomal system of the cell.
https://openalex.org/W1612386336,"Abstract In the preceding paper we describe the purification to homogeneity of the membrane adenosine triphosphatase from Streptococcus faecalis. Here we report some of the molecular characteristics of this enzyme. The molecular weight of the native enzyme and its subunits was determined by the Yphantis high speed sedimentation equilibrium method. In addition, the amino acid composition was determined, and the enzyme was examined by gel electrophoresis in 8 m urea and by electron microscopy. The partial specific volume, calculated from the amino acid composition, is 0.735 ml per g; a value of 0.742 ml per g was obtained from the comparison of sedimentation equilibria in D2O and H2O. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of 385,000 and s020,w of 13.4. From these two values a frictional ratio of 1.35 could be calculated. From the specific activity of our most highly purified preparations and the molecular weight, a maximal turnover number of 18,000 per molecule per min could be estimated. The molecular weight of the subunits, determined by sedmentation equilibrium in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, is 33,000. This value is in good agreement with a minimal molecular weight of 32,800 calculated from the amino acid composition. It is thus concluded that the enzyme consists of 12 subunits. Electrophoretic analyses in 7% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea indicate that the enzyme consists of two kinds of subunits, designated α and β. No free NH2-terminal amino acids could be detected by the 3H-fluorodinitrobenzene method. Electron micrographs of a negatively stained preparation of the ATPase show particles of uniform size with a substructure that suggests a planar, hexagonal array of 6 globules. A model of the enzyme with a formula α6β6 is proposed, consisting of a hexagonal arrangement of 6 globules, each of which is made up of an α and a β subunit."

The substrates, fructose-6-phosphate and adenosine triphosphate, protect the enzyme from this, inhibition as does the addition of dithiothreitol to the inhibitors. Incubation of taxodione with phosphofructokinase is associated with the loss of about one sulfhydryl group per inhibitor molecule, and the substrates protect six sulfhydryl groups per protomer of 93,000 daltons."
https://openalex.org/W1525235396,An ATP-dependent phosphokinase which catalyzes the conversion of C55-isoprenoid alcohols and some other related substrates to the C55-isoprenoid alcohol phosphates is present in the membrane fraction of Staphylococcus aureus. The product of the reaction is a substrate for the synthesis of lipid intermediates in peptidoglycan synthesis. The enzyme has the unusual property of being extracted into acidic butanol-1 at room temperature and can then be further purified by precipitation from butanol at -15°. The material so obtained is soluble in a number of organic solvents in addition to butanol-1 and exhibits a relatively high degree of stability in these solvents. It is insoluble in water and relatively unstable on suspension in this solvent. The presence of this enzyme and of C55-isoprenoid alcohol in S. aureus accounts for the stimulation by ATP of peptidoglycan synthesis catalyzed by particulate enzyme from this organism. A possible function for the enzyme is discussed.

Both tissues undergo a similar sequence of events leading to reconstruction of hemopoietic marrow nodules. Histogenesis of yellow marrow then continues; such implants become nodules of fatty marrow, whereas implants of red marrow remain hemopoietically active. This observation supports the concept that histogenesis of the bone marrow recapitulates the ontogeny of this organ and indicates an intrinsic difference between the stroma of red and yellow marrow."
https://openalex.org/W1500591441,Abstract Addition of several N-arylaminonaphthalenesulfonate dyes to submitochondrial particles from bovine heart resulted in an enhancement of fluorescence of from 50- to 150-fold and a considerable shift in the wave length of maximum emission toward the ultraviolet. The results indicate 40 to 55 dye-binding sites per mg of submitochondrial particles. A preliminary search revealed that mitochondrial ATPase may be one of the components of the mitochondrial membrane responsible for the fluorescent responses of the dyes. Addition of substrates or ATP to a reaction containing submitochondrial particles and dye led to a further enhancement of fluorescence which was about equal in magnitude to that observed upon formation of the dye-particle complex. The second enhancement was prevented or diminished by the addition of inhibitors of respiration or uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. Substrate- and ATP-mediated fluorescence enhancement was stimulated by coupling factors in submitochondrial particles which required coupling factors for oxidative phosphorylation. Evidence is presented which shows that these dyes may be used as highly sensitive indicators of energy coupling in submitochondrial particles.
https://openalex.org/W1563356369,"Abstract Actin activation of the ATPase activity of heavy meromyosin, a tryptic digestion product of myosin, was studied over a wide range of actin and ATP concentrations with creatine kinase and creatine phosphate added to hold the ATP concentration constant. Double reciprocal plots of ATPase against ATP concentration at varied actin concentration and of ATPase against actin concentration at varied ATP concentration were linear, suggesting that the system obeys simple Michaelis kinetics. From extrapolation of these plots we found that not only does ATP increase the dissociation of actin from heavy meromyosin but, analogously, the Michaelis constant of the acto-heavy meromyosin ATPase is greater than that of the heavy meromyosin ATPase. However, whereas the dissociation of actin from the heavy meromyosin-ATP complex is markedly dependent on ionic strength, the Michaelis constant of the acto-heavy meromyosin ATPase shows no salt dependence whatever. These data have important implications for the kinetic model which we previously proposed for the actin-heavy meromyosin-ATP system."
https://openalex.org/W1581491318,"Abstract The membrane adenosine triphosphatase from Streptococcus faecalis has been purified by heat treatment, gel filtration through Agarose, and repeated chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The purified ATPase appears to be homogeneous as judged from gel electrophoresis and sedimentation velocity studies. Sedimentation equilibrium studies, which are presented in the succeeding paper, also indicate that the purified preparation is homogeneous. Both products of the ATPase reaction, ADP and inorganic phosphate, are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme with Ki values of 0.7 and 10 mm, respectively, and the two have synergistic inhibitory effects. The purified enzyme does not catalyze an ADP-ATP exchange, and no evidence for a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate could be found. No cooperative homotropic effect of ATP on the purified enzyme could be observed over the range of substrate concentrations tested."

Activity can be largely restored to treated particles by addition of solubilized protein factor or factors, which functionally resemble coupling factors isolated from other kinds of energy-converting systems. Evidence is presented in support of the conclusion that the R. capsulata factor is required for coupling phosphorylation to electron transport rather than for catalyzing electron transport."

https://openalex.org/W1608216341,"Abstract A particulate d-alanine carboxypeptidase present in Bacillus subtilis has been studied. This enzyme has a pH optimum near 5, and is activated by Zn+2 cations. The enzyme is inactivated by penicillin G and activity cannot be restored by washing or by treating it with penicillinase. 14C-Penicillin G is also bound to this particulate enzyme. Both the binding of penicillin G and the inactivation of the carboxypeptidase by penicillin G are reversed by treatment with neutral hydroxylamine, and the kinetics of these two processes is identical. d-Alanine carboxypeptidase activity is also inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents such as iodoacetate in a manner similar to their inhibition of penicillin binding. The possibility that the particulate d-alanine carboxypeptidase may be an uncoupled transpeptidase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1510815757,"Abstract Phosphofructokinase has been purified from Clostridium pasteurianum and prepared in crystalline form in the presence and the absence of ATP. The enzyme preparation is homogeneous as shown by sedimentation velocity, sedimentation equilibrium, and acrylamide gel electrophoretic techniques. The molecular weight of the clostridial phosphofructokinase is 144,000. The enzyme is dissociated to subunits with molecular weight of about 35,000 in guanidine or urea or by treatment with maleic anhydride. Peptide mapping of a tryptic digest of the enzyme, acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme in urea, and the electrophoresis of the maleylated phosphofructokinase indicate that all these subunits are identical. Based on these observations, it is concluded that clostridial phosphofructokinase consists of 4 identical subunits. Kinetic studies show that the enzyme exhibits sigmoidal kinetics with respect to fructose 6-phosphate at all levels of ATP. ADP normalizes this initial velocity pattern to yield Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Unlike mammalian phosphofructokinases, the clostridial enzyme is not significantly inhibited by ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, or citrate. The activity of the enzyme is absolutely dependent on NH4+ and Mg++, and a possible physiological significance of the former cation is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W3119994227,"Abstract The binding of radioactive penicillin G to a particulate enzyme preparation derived from Bacillus subtilis has been examined. The binding required an intact β-lactam ring and showed saturation kinetics. About 49 µµmoles of penicillin G were bound per mg of enzyme protein. The binding was reversed by neutral hydroxylamine, ethanethiol, or H2O2. The product of reversal with hydroxylamine was identified as penicilloyl hydroxamate, and that with ethanethiol after methylation as α-ethylthio-β-methylbenzylpenicilloate. The binding was also prevented by prior reaction of the particulate enzyme preparation with sulfhydryl reagents such as iodoacetate. These data indicate that penicillin G reacted with some component of the particulate enzyme preparation to form a thiol ester of penicilloic acid and a functional thiol group in the enzyme preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2169463539,"Abstract A vesicular membrane system (microsomes) was prepared from rabbit brain. Ca2+ uptake was observed in this preparation upon incubation with ATP and Mg2+. Tris-oxalate did not increase Ca2+ uptake. A decrease in adsorbed Ca2+, coupled to an increase in Ca2+ transport, was observed upon addition of 4 mm Pi to the incubating media. Ca2+ adsorption was higher in presence of 120 mm KCl than in a medium with 120 mm NaCl. Ca2+ transport was lower in a medium without supporting concentrations of monovalent cations. Acetyl phosphate as substrate would not support Ca2+ uptake in brain microsomes. Brain microsomal ATPase was activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+ similarly to that in skeletal muscle microsomes. Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity was higher in media containing 120 mm KCl than 120 mm NaCl. Ouabain did not inhibit this activity. The amount of Ca2+ bound by skeletal muscle microsomes in an oxalate-free medium was 2- to 4-fold higher than in brain microsomes. In these experiments, the Ca2+ Pi ratio was 0.15 to 0.30 both in brain and muscle microsomes. Ca2+ Pi ratios between 1.0 and 1.2 were obtained in skeletal muscle microsomes incubated in media containing 4 mm Tris-oxalate."
https://openalex.org/W1555307100,"Abstract During ATP hydrolysis, microsomal preparations form an acid-stable protein-phosphate complex. Since there is evidence that two different independent enzymatic sites catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP in calf brain microsomes, it was reasoned that either one or both of these might contribute to the formation of this complex. To determine the actual relationships, the phosphorylation reaction was compared with hydrolysis at each of the ATPase sites—at different levels of Na+, K+, and ATP and at different temperatures. The kinetic analysis indicates that it is hydrolysis at Site I, the Na+, -K+ ATPase, which correlates with the steady state level of protein-phosphate complex. The results add support to the hypothesis that this complex is an intermediate in the hydrolysis of ATP by the Na+-K+ ATPase—the site that takes part in Na+ and K+ transport across biological membranes. The second ATPase, Site II, is a Na+-ATPase inhibited by K+; the kinetic analysis indicates that this site does not contribute substantially to the steady state level of acid-stable phosphorylated intermediate. It is suggested that Site II may be related to a sodium pump such as the one in red blood cells described by J. F. Hoffman and F. M. Kregnow (Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci., 137, 566 (1966))."
https://openalex.org/W1604467286,"Abstract Erythropoietin causes the conversion of primitive cells to erythrocytes. Some biochemical alterations seen in vitro during this induced process are increased RNA synthesis, DNA synthesis, iron uptake, and hemoglobin synthesis. In experiments of relatively long duration, inhibition of DNA synthesis prevents erythropoietin-stimulated iron uptake and hemoglobin synthesis. In shorter experiments, both these functions and stimulated RNA synthesis are completely expressed in the absence of stimulated DNA synthesis. Inhibition of either RNA or protein synthesis, however, causes complete suppression of the erythropoietin effect on iron uptake, hemoglobin synthesis, and DNA synthesis. These data, and earlier data on the time course of erythropoietin-stimulated RNA synthesis, indicate that the primary action of the inducer is not on cell division or DNA replication but on RNA or protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1545255119,"Abstract Teichoic acid synthesis was examined in two types of phage-resistant mutants of Staphylococcus aureus H that have altered cell wall composition. In type I mutants (52A2, 52A4, 52B2) which lack N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) on the cell wall ribitol teichoic acid, the CDP-ribitol:acceptor phosphoribitoltransferase was normal but no UDP-GlcNAc:poly(ribitol phosphate) GlcNAc-transferase activity was detected. Revertants of type I mutants recovered the normal levels of GlcNAc in the teichoic acid as well as GlcNAc-transferase activity. Type II mutants (52A5, 52A7, M3, M9) lacked ribitol teichoic acid in the cell wall and no ribitol phosphate polymer was detected in any other cell fraction or in the spent medium. Despite the lack of ribitol teichoic acid, normal activities in vitro of phosphoribitoltransferase and GlcNAc-transferase were found in these mutants. Compared to the parent strain, trichloracetic acid extracts of type II mutants contained high levels of CDP-ribitol. The lack of ribitol teichoic acid in the cell wall is caused presumably by some defect in the membrane or in some unknown factor required in the polymerization or attachment step of the teichoic acid to murein."

The first amino acid is added to UDP-acetyl-muramyl-pentapeptide in a reaction which requires aminoacyl transfer RNA and is catalyzed by a soluble enzyme. Either l-alanine or l-serine can be added to the uridine nucleotide in a reaction catalyzed by this enzyme; the lack of specificity for the tRNA moiety is noteworthy. UDP-acetylmuramyl-hexapeptide (containing either l-alanine or l-serine) can be utilized for peptidoglycan synthesis. The second amino acid may be added to the lipid intermediate in peptidoglycan synthesis generated from UDP-acetylmuramyl-hexapeptide in a reaction catalyzed by a particulate enzyme. Like the addition of the first amino acid, the addition of the second amino acid also appears to be relatively nonspecific for either l-alanine or l-serine in the reaction in vitro."

Binding of phospholipids and other mitochondrial proteins, properties evinced by insoluble structural protein preparations, can also be shown with the purified major components, but this binding appears to be of no physiological importance. It is concluded that at least one major component of the previously described structural protein preparations is actually an inactivated enzyme, and that there is no justification for stating that the preparations fulfill a structural role within mitochondria. Some previously undocumented chemical features of the mitochondrial ATPase are described."

The enzyme exhibited some activity when assayed in tetramethylammonium-glycylclycine buffer even in the absence of other monovalent cations, suggesting that the requirement for monovalent cations is not absolute. K+ increased the reaction velocity about 4-fold in the presence of excess ATP and d -fructose-1-P, and about 10-fold when both substrates were present at concentrations near their Km values (0.3 m m ). K+ also exerted a much greater activating effect under conditions of inhibiting ATP levels than when Mg++ was present at a sufficiently high level to prevent inhibition by ATP. The K a for K+ (about 3 m m ) was not affected by the Mg++ or ATP concentration, but was increased by decreased levels of d -fructose-1-P. K+ decreased the Km values for both ATP and d -fructose-1-P. These kinetics are consistent with Michaelis-Menten theory and suggest a simple model in which the enzyme exists in two active forms, one form predominating in the presence of K+ and the other predominating in its absence."
