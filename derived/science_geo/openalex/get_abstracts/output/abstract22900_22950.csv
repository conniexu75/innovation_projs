https://openalex.org/W2055979394,"In recent years, nerve growth factor (NGF) has gained attention as a potential therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To study the expression of NGF and its homologs, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), postmortem samples of hippocampus from AD and control donors were examined by in situ hybridization. Hybridization signal for BDNF, but not NGF or NT-3, was decreased in samples of hippocampus from donors with AD. Decreased transcript abundance of BDNF mRNA in hippocampi of individuals with AD was verified by an RNAase protection assay. These results suggest the possibility that decreased expression of BDNF may contribute to the progression of cell death in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2080880626,"In vertebrates, the formation and maintenance of neuronal connections are subject to regulation by multiple target-derived, diffusible (neurotrophic) factors. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel neurotrophic factor designated neurotrophin-5 (NT-5). NT-5 is structurally related to nerve growth factor and is expressed in embryonic as well as adult tissues. Recombinant NT-5 promotes the survival of peripheral sensory and sympathetic neurons and induces differentiation of the pheochromocytoma cell line PC12. NT-5 activates two trk-related tyrosine kinase receptors and shares these receptors with other neurotrophins. Activation of multiple receptors may permit a single neurotrophin to control target innervation by distinct neuronal populations. Receptor sharing could enable neurotrophic factors emanating from distinct targets to cooperate in regulating neurons with multiple connections."

https://openalex.org/W2042183734,"Following voltage-dependent activation, Drosophila Shaker K+ channels enter a nonconducting, inactivated state. This process has been proposed to occur by a ""ball-and-chain"" mechanism, in which the N-terminus of the protein behaves like a blocker tethered to the cytoplasmic side of the channel and directly occludes the pore to cause inactivation. To complement the ample evidence for the involvement of the N-terminus, we sought evidence that it blocks the pore directly. We found that inactivation exhibits several distinctive properties of pore blockade. First, recovery was speeded by increased external K+ concentrations, just as blockade can be relieved by trans-permeant ions. Second, single-channel experiments show that the channel reopens from the inactivated state upon repolarization. These openings were usually required for recovery, as though the blocking particle must exit the pore before the channel can close."

https://openalex.org/W1975424106,"Although many K+ channel genes encoding homologous subunits have been cloned, a central question remains: how do these subunits associate to produce the diversity of K+ currents observed in living cells? Previous work has shown that different subunits encoded by the Shaker gene subfamily are able to form heteromultimers, which add to the diversity of currents. However, the unrestrained mixing of subunits from all genes to form hybrid channels would be undesirable for some cells that clearly require functionally discrete K+ currents. We show that Drosophila Shaker, Shal, Shab, and Shaw subunits form functional homomultimers, but that a molecular barrier to heteropolymerization is present. Coexpression of all four K+ channel systems does not alter their individual properties in any way. These experiments also demonstrate that multiple, independent A-current systems together with multiple, independent delayed rectifier systems can coexist in single cells."
https://openalex.org/W2001607246,"Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of norepinephrine, the principal classic neurotransmitter of peripheral sympathetic neurons. We have shown that 5.8 kb of 5' upstream region from a cloned human DBH gene promoter is sufficient to direct expression of the E. coli lacZ gene in transgenic mice to neurons of the locus ceruleus and other classic noradrenergic brain stem nuclei, sympathetic ganglion neurons, and adrenal chromaffin cells. lacZ expression was also observed in neurons of the enteric system, the retina, some sensory and all cranial parasympathetic ganglia, and some diencephalic and telencephalic brain nuclei. The expression pattern of the transgene in DBH-immunonegative sites overlapped with many sites where expression of tyrosine hydroxylase or phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, two other catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, has been reported."

https://openalex.org/W1520912904,"Coenzyme Q functions as a lipid-soluble electron carrier in eukaryotes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the enzymes responsible for the assembly of the polyisoprenoid side chain and subsequent transfer to para-hydroxybenzoate (PHB) are encoded by the nuclear genes COQ1 and COQ2, respectively. Yeast mutants defective in coenzyme Q biosynthesis are respiratory defective and provide a useful tool to study this non-sterol branch of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. We isolated a 5.5-kilobase genomic DNA fragment that was able to functionally complement a coq2 strain. Additional complementation analyses located the COQ2 gene within a 2.1-kilobase HindIII-BglII restriction fragment. Sequence analyses revealed the presence of a 1,116-base pair open reading frame coding for a predicted protein of 372 amino acids and a molecular mass of 41,001 daltons. The amino acid sequence exhibits a typical amino-terminal mitochondrial leader sequence and six potential membrane-spanning domains. Primer extension and Northern analyses indicate the gene is transcriptionally active. Transformation of a coq2 strain with the 2.1-kilobase HindIII-BglII genomic restriction fragment on a multicopy plasmid restores PHB:polyprenyltransferase activity to wild-type levels. Disruption of the chromosomal COQ2 gene indicates the gene is not essential for viability, yet is required for PHB:polyprenyltransferase activity and respiratory function. In addition, the deduced amino acid sequence of PHB:polyprenyltransferase contains a putative allylic polyprenyl diphosphate-binding site. The presence of this aspartate-rich domain in a number of functionally distinct proteins which utilize polyprenyl diphosphate substrates is reported."
https://openalex.org/W2155883881,"Voltage-dependent calcium influx has been shown to regulate the differentiation of cultured amphibian spinal neurons. We have examined the transient elevation of intracellular calcium induced by depolarization, using calcium indicators and confocal microscopy with high temporal and spatial resolution. Rapid calcium elevations in both the nucleus and the cytosol are primarily due to calcium-dependent release of calcium from intracellular stores. Depletion of stores associated with the endoplasmic reticulum reduces all transients. Elevations diminish with neuronal maturation. Depletion of stores of intracellular calcium at early times affects neuronal differentiation in a manner similar to the prevention of influx. The results indicate that both influx and release are necessary to promote neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2077265224,"To investigate how the onset of neurotrophic factor dependence in neurons is coordinated with the arrival of their axons in the target field, we have studied the survival of four populations of cranial sensory neurons whose axons reach their common central target field, the hindbrain, at different times. We show that neurons whose axons reach the hindbrain first survive for a short time in culture before responding to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Neurons whose axons reach the hindbrain later survive longer before responding to BDNF. These differences in survival, which arise prior to gangliogenesis, may play a role in coordinating trophic interactions for cranial sensory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1580966290,"We present evidence that the amino-terminal 39 residue region of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- (HMG) CoA reductase, which includes the putative first transmembrane span, is a signal sequence for targeting HMG-CoA reductase to the endoplasmic reticulum. This evidence is based upon fractionation, endoglycosidase-H sensitivity and protease protection assays on an in vitro transcription/translocation system programmed with a mutant cDNA of HMG-CoA reductase that is deleted for sequences coding for all of the putative transmembrane spans except the first. We show that the protein product of this mutant cDNA is associated with microsomes, glycosylated, or protected from proteolysis only in the presence of Signal Recognition Particle. Also, we present evidence for a topological model of HMG-CoA reductase that consists of eight transmembrane spans. This evidence is based upon a concanavalin A binding assay for in vivo glycosylation of an engineered glycosylation site in each of a series of mutants of the fusion protein, HMGal (Skalnik, D. G., Narita, H., Kent, C., and Simoni, R. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6836-6841). This series of mutants was designed such that for each linker segment between transmembrane spans, a mutant was constructed with an engineered glycosylation site introduced into that linker segment. We show that only the mutants with glycosylation sites in the linker segments between transmembrane spans 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 are glycosylated. These results support an eight transmembrane span model for the topology of HMG-CoA reductase and are inconsistent with a seven-transmembrane span model."
https://openalex.org/W1537888013,"Human coagulation factor V is an integral component of the prothrombinase complex. Rapid activation of prothrombin is dependent on the interactions of this nonenzymatic cofactor with factor Xa and prothrombin in the presence of calcium ions and a phospholipid or platelet surface. Factor V is similar structurally and functionally to the homologous cofactor, factor VIII, which interacts with factor IXa to accelerate factor X activation in the presence of calcium and phospholipids. Both of these cofactors, when activated, possess homologous heavy and light chains. Binding to anionic phospholipids is mediated by the light chains of these two cofactors. In bovine factor Va, a phosphatidylserine-specific binding site has been localized to the amino-terminal A3 domain of the light chain. In human factor VIII, on the other hand, a region within the carboxyl-terminal C2 domain of the light chain has been shown to interact with anionic phospholipids. We have constructed a series of recombinant deletion mutants lacking domain-size fragments of the light chain of human factor V (rHFV). These mutants are expressed and secreted as single-chain proteins by COS cells. Thrombin and the factor V activator from Russell's viper venom process these deletion mutants as expected. The light chain deletion mutants possess essentially no procoagulant activity, nor are they activated by treatment with factor V activator from Russell's viper venom. Deletion of the second C-type domain results in essentially complete loss of phosphatidylserine-specific binding whereas the presence of the C2 domain alone (rHFV des-A3C1, which lacks the A3 and C1 domains of the light chain) results in significant phosphatidylserine-specific binding. The presence of the A3 domain alone (rHFV des-C1C2) does not mediate binding to immobilized phosphatidylserine. Increasing calcium ion concentrations result in decreased binding of recombinant human factor V and the mutant rHFV des-A3C1 to phosphatidylserine, similar to previous studies with purified plasma factor V and phospholipid vesicles. These results indicate that human factor V, similar to human factor VIII, possesses a phosphatidylserine-specific binding site within the C2 domain of the light chain."
https://openalex.org/W1484429384,"Replication forks formed during rolling-circle DNA synthesis supported by a tailed form II DNA substrate in the presence of the primosome, the single-stranded DNA binding protein, and the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (Pol III HE) that had been reconstituted from the purified subunits, beta, tau, and the gamma.delta complex, at limiting (with respect to nucleotide incorporation) concentrations of the Pol III core (alpha, epsilon, and theta) produced aberrantly small Okazaki fragments, while the synthesis of the leading strand was unperturbed. These small Okazaki fragments were not arrayed in tandem along the lagging-strand DNA template, but were separated by large gaps. Similarly structured synthetic products were not manufactured by replication forks reconstituted with higher, saturating concentrations of the Pol III core. Replication forks producing these small fragments could respond, by modulating the size of the Okazaki fragments produced, to variations in the concentration of NTPs or the primase, conditions that affect the frequency of priming on the lagging strand, but not to variation in the concentration of dNTPs, conditions that affect the frequency of utilization of the primers. Significantly longer Okazaki fragments (greater than 7 kilobases) could be produced in the presence of a limiting amount of Pol III core at low concentrations of the primase. These observations indicated that the production of small Okazaki fragments was not a result of a debilitated lagging-strand Pol III core, but rather a function of the time available for nascent strand synthesis during the cycle of events that are required for the manufacture of an Okazaki fragment and that it was the association of primase with the replication fork that keyed this cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2027416474,"The delayed rectifier current of embryonic Xenopus spinal neurons plays the central role in developmental conversion of calcium-dependent action potentials to sodium-dependent spikes. During its maturation, this potassium current undergoes a pronounced increase in rate of activation. The mechanism underlying the change in kinetics was analyzed with whole-cell voltage clamp of neurons cultured under various conditions. Calcium is necessary at an early stage of development, to permit influx that triggers subsequent release of calcium from intracellular stores. Its action is prevented by depletion of protein kinase C and mimicked by stimulation of the kinase. Calcium influx through voltage-dependent channels at early stages of development regulates the differentiation of potassium current kinetics and modulation of the ionic dependence of action potentials."
https://openalex.org/W1606886000,"Chromogranin B (CgB, also called secretogranin I) is a secretory protein sorted to secretory granules in a wide variety of endocrine cells and neurons. Unexpectedly, after stimulation of regulated secretion in the neuroendocrine cell line PC12, a fraction of the exocytosed CgB was not released into the medium but remained associated with the plasma membrane. The addition of exogenous CgB to unstimulated cells did not result in the appearance of cell surface CgB, suggesting that the presence of cell surface CgB could not be accounted for by adsorption of released CgB to the cell surface. Upon further incubation of stimulated PC12 cells, the surface CgB was internalized by the cells and largely degraded. The surface CgB was not released by exposure to pH 11, yet it partitioned in the aqueous phase upon Triton X-114 phase separation. Subcellular fractionation and differential extraction studies showed that the membrane-associated CgB constituted at least 10% of the total cellular CgB. These observations suggest that (a) the appearance of CgB at the cell surface is due to fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane and (b) a fraction of CgB is present in tight association with the secretory granule membrane. We propose a model in which membrane-associated CgB, by virtue of its ability to interact in a homophilic manner with soluble CgB, plays a key role in the sorting and targeting of CgB to the regulated pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1559827839,"To investigate the role of the priming apparatus at the replication fork in determining Okazaki fragment size, the products of primer synthesis generated in vitro during rolling-circle DNA replication catalyzed by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, the single-stranded DNA binding protein, and the primosome on a tailed form II DNA template were isolated and characterized. The abundance of oligoribonucleotide primers and the incidence of covalent DNA chain extension of the primer population was measured under different reaction conditions known to affect the size of the products of lagging-strand DNA synthesis. These analyses demonstrated that the factors affecting Okazaki fragment length could be distinguished by either their effect on the frequency of primer synthesis or by their influence on the efficiency of initiation of DNA synthesis from primer termini. Primase and the ribonucleoside triphosphates were found to stimulate primer synthesis. The observed trend toward smaller fragment size as the concentration of these effectors was raised was apparently a direct consequence of the increased frequency of primer synthesis. The beta subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates did not alter the priming frequency; instead, the concentration of these factors influenced the ability of the lagging-strand DNA polymerase to efficiently utilize primers to initiate DNA synthesis. Maximum utilization of the available primers correlated with the lowest mean value of Okazaki fragment length. These data were used to draw general conclusions concerning the temporal order of enzymatic steps that operate during a cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis on the lagging-strand DNA template."

https://openalex.org/W1969222610,"The 5' flanking region from the human dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene directs expression of bacterial beta-galactosidase reporter genes to a subset of adult neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells of transgenic mice. In this paper, we examine the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of these transgenes during embryogenesis. Expression begins at embryonic day 9 in the developing central and peripheral nervous systems and persists in cell populations in which expression is observed in adult transgenic mice. However, transient embryonic expression occurs in presumptive neuroblasts in developing sensory ganglia and ventrolateral neural tube that are destined to synthesize neurotransmitters other than catecholamines. These observations support the concept that some cells fated to become ""non-catecholaminergic"" neurons exhibit transient catecholaminergic features during their differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1568637272,"The COOH-terminal non-collagenous domains (NC1) of type IV collagen from glomerular basement membranes (GBM), lens capsule basement membranes, and Descemet's membrane varied in the distribution of their NC1 subunits. All of these basement membranes (BMs) contained both classical (alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV)) and novel collagen chains (alpha 3(IV), alpha 4(IV) and the Alport antigen). Whereas GBM had a predominance of disulfide-bonded subunits, the lens capsule and Descemet's membrane were primarily monomeric, differences that are likely related to the functional and structural diversity of collagen in various tissues. A heterodimer formed from monomeric subunits of alpha 3(IV) and the Alport antigen exists in human and bovine GBM. This dimer represents an important cross-link of the NC1 domain of novel collagen. Additionally, immunoaffinity methodology showed that the novel BM collagen hexamers segregate into populations containing only novel BM subunits without the participation of the classical subunits (alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV)). These data provided evidence for the presence of two separate networks of BM collagen: one containing alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV), and the other consisting of the novel collagen chains."

https://openalex.org/W1552704337,"C5 convertase of the classical complement pathway is a protein complex consisting of C4b, C2a, and C3b. Within this complex C3b binds to C4b via an ester linkage. We now present evidence that the covalent C3b-binding site on human C4b is Ser at position 1217 of C4. We also show that formation of the covalently linked C4b.C3b complex occurs in the mouse complement system and that the C3b-binding site on mouse C4b is Ser at position 1213 which is homologous to Ser-1217 of human C4. Therefore, covalent binding of C3b to a single specific site on C4b within the classical pathway C5 convertase is likely a common phenomenon in the mammalian complement system. Specific noncovalent association of metastable C3b with C4b would occur first, leading to reaction of the thioester with a specific hydroxy group. This is supported by two lines of experimental evidence, one which shows that a mutant C4 that does not make a covalent linkage with C3b is still capable of forming C5 convertase and a second in which the C4b.C3b complex has been demonstrated by cross-linking erythrocytes bearing this C5 convertase."
https://openalex.org/W1512523392,"We have constructed a series of mutations in the membrane and linker domains of Syrian hamster 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-(HMG) CoA reductase in order to determine the regions critical for the regulated degradation of the enzyme. In transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, we have expressed a fusion protein, HMGal, which consists of the membrane and linker domains of the Syrian hamster HMG-CoA reductase fused to beta-galactosidase. Using this fusion protein, we have determined that a deletion of 64 amino acids from the central region of the membrane domain causes the protein to be degraded extremely rapidly. In addition, deletion of PEST sequences has little effect on degradation, but deletion of the linker domain makes the protein's degradation insensitive to sterols and mevalonate. In addition to deletion mutations, we have systematically replaced each hydrophobic, putative membrane spanning region of the membrane domain with the first transmembrane sequence from bacteriorhodopsin. Replacement of span 4 has no effect on degradation. Replacements of spans 5 or 6 result in a protein which has a normal basal rate of degradation, but this rate of degradation is not accelerated by mevalonate, low density lipoprotein, or 25-hydroxycholesterol. Replacement of span 3 results in a protein whose degradation is similarly not accelerated by sterols or mevalonate, but since this protein might be mislocalized, these results are inconclusive. Replacement of span 7 yields a short-lived protein which is degraded more rapidly in response to mevalonate but not in response to exogenous sterols. Replacement of span 8 extends both the basal and mevalonate-accelerated half-life about 5-fold. This work begins to define the critical regions for regulated degradation within the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1846076985,"The three-dimensional structure of the 131-residue rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, without bound ligand (apoI-FABP), has been refined with x-ray diffraction data to a nominal resolution of 1.19 A. The final model has a conventional crystallographic R-factor of 16.9% for 34,290 unique reflections [a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation for bond length of 0.012 A and a r.m.s. deviation of 2.368 degrees for bond angles]. Ninety-two residues are present as components of the protein's 10 anti-parallel beta-strands while 14 residues are part of its two short alpha-helices. The beta-strands and alpha-helices are organized into two nearly orthogonal beta-sheets. Particular attention has been placed in defining solvent structure and the structures of discretely disordered groups in this protein. Two hundred thirty-seven solvent molecules have been identified; 24 are located within apoI-FABP. The refined model includes alternate conformers for 228 protein atoms (109 main-chain, 119 side-chain) and 63 solvent molecules. We have found several aromatic side-chains with multiple conformations located near, or in, the protein's ligand binding site. This observation, along with the fact that these side-chains have a temperature factor that is relatively higher than that of other aromatic residues, suggests that they may be involved in the process of noncovalent binding of fatty acid. The absence of a true hydrophobic core in I-FABP suggests that its structural integrity may be maintained primarily by a hydrogen bonding network involving protein and solvent atoms."

https://openalex.org/W1548539963,"Using immunological and chemical cleavage techniques, we have previously identified a domain contained within residues Phe56-Ser86 in the first tandem repeat (A1) of the heavy chain of factor XI which binds high Mr kininogen (Baglia, F. A., Jameson, B. A., and Walsh, P. N. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4149-4154). We have now chemically synthesized peptides from corresponding homologous regions in the second (A2), third (A3), and fourth (A4) tandem repeats of the heavy chain (A2: Asn145-Ala176; A3: Asn235-Arg266; and A4: Gly326-Lys357). These peptides had no effect on the binding of factor XI to high Mr kininogen. Because of a lack of detailed structural information for the A1 domain, a molecular model of this region was constructed. This hypothetical model made distinct and testable predictions regarding potential surfaces and concomitant secondary structure. Specifically, the resulting structure depicted two juxtaposed beta-stranded stem-loops that, in conjunction with biological information, constitute a candidate surface for contact with high Mr kininogen. The hypothetical A1 model was, consequently, used as a predictive template in the rational design of two synthetic peptides (Val59-Arg70 and Asn72-Lys83). When both these peptides were added together and the binding of factor XI to high Mr kininogen was examined, a synergistic inhibitory effect was observed compared with each peptide added individually. Our data are consistent with the notion that the sequence of amino acids from Val59-Lys83 of the heavy chain of factor XI contains two antiparallel beta-strands connected by beta-turns that together comprise a continuous surface utilized for the binding of high Mr kininogen."

https://openalex.org/W1515985925,"As an early step in DNA strand exchange reactions, the recA protein aligns homologous sequences within two DNA molecules to form a putative triple-stranded intermediate. In virtually all models for three-stranded DNA proposed to date, hydrogen bonds involving the N-7 position of guanine have played a prominent structural role. To determine whether the N-7 position of guanine is required for triple helix and heteroduplex formation in the recA protein-mediated DNA pairing reaction, guanine was completely replaced by the base analog 7-deazaguanine in both strands of the duplex DNA substrate using polymerase chain reaction. This modified double-strand DNA was reacted with unmodified single-strand DNA in vitro. The 7-deazaguanine-substituted DNA functioned as well as the unsubstituted DNA in recA protein-mediated DNA three-strand exchange reactions. Strand exchange reactions involving four strands also proceeded normally when three of the four strands contained 7-deazaguanine rather than guanine. In fact, the rate of strand exchange improved somewhat when the modified DNA substrates were used. This indicates either that the N-7 position of guanine is not essential for the formation of the putative triple-stranded DNA pairing intermediate, or that a three-stranded (or four-stranded) structure is not an obligate intermediate in recA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange."

https://openalex.org/W1606682795,"The temperate phage P1 encodes two genes whose products antagonize the action of the phage's C1 repressor of lytic functions, namely a distantly linked antirepressor gene, ant, and a closely linked c1 inactivator gene, coi. Starting with an inducible coi-recombinant plasmid, Coi protein was overproduced and purified to near homogeneity. By using a DNA mobility shift assay we demonstrate that Coi protein inhibits the operator binding of the C1 repressors of the closely related P1 and P7 phages. Coi protein (Mr = 7,600) exerts its C1-inactivating function by forming a complex with the C1 repressor (Mr = 32,500) at a molar ratio of about 1:1, as shown by density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration. C1 repressor and Coi protein are recovered in active form from the complex, suggesting that noncovalent interactions are the sole requirements for complex formation. The interplay of repressor and antagonists operating in the life cycle of P1 is discussed."
