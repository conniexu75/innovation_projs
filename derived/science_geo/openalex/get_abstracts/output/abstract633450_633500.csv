https://openalex.org/W2945241484,"Chronic pain, such as low-back pain, can be a highly disabling condition degrading people's quality of life (QoL). Not every patient responds to pharmacological therapies, thus alternative treatments have to be developed. The chronicity of pain can lead to a somatic dysperception, meaning a mismatch between patients' own body perception and its actual physical state. Since clinical evaluation of pain relies on patients' subjective reports, a body image disruption can be associated with an incorrect pain rating inducing incorrect treatment and a possible risk of drug abuse. Our aim was to reduce chronic low-back pain through a multimodal neurorehabilitative strategy using innovative technologies to help patients regain a correct body image.Twenty patients with chronic low-back pain were included. Before and after treatment, patients underwent: a neurological exam; a neuro-psychological evaluation testing cognitive functions (memory, attention, executive functions) and personality traits, QoL and mood; pain ratings; sensorimotor functional abilities' testing. Patients underwent a 6 week-neurorehabilitative treatment (total 12 sessions) using virtual reality (VRRS system, Khymeia, Italy). Treatment consisted on teaching patients to execute correct movements with the painful body parts to regain a correct body image, based on the augmented multisensory feedback (auditory, visual) provided by the VRRS.Our data showed significant reductions in all pain rating scale scores (p<0.05); significant improvements of QoL in the domains of physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, vitality, and social role functioning; improvements in cognitive functions (p<0.05); improvements in functional scales (p<0.05) and mood (p = 0.04).This non-pharmacological approach was able to act on the multi-dimensional aspects of pain and improved patients' QoL, pain intensity, mood and patient's functional abilities."

Martix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 16S rDNA sequencing were applied to study environmental bacteria strains.With both approches, problematic spore-forming Bacillus spp, but also Staphylococcus spp., Lysinibacillus spp., Micrococcus spp. and Brevibacillus spp were identified. However, application of spectrometric technique allows for an unambiguous distinction between species/species groups e.g.B. subtilis or B. cereus groups. MALDI TOF MS and 16S rDNA sequencing allow for construction of phyloproteomic and phylogenetic trees of identified bacterial species. Furthermore, the correlation beetween physicochemical properties, geographical and botanical origin and the presence bacterial species in honey samples were investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2946428698,"Network theory proved recently to be useful in the quantification of many properties of financial systems. The analysis of the structure of investment portfolios is a major application since their eventual correlation and overlap impact the actual risk by individual investors. We investigate the bipartite network of US mutual fund portfolios and their assets. We follow its evolution during the Global Financial Crisis and study the diversification, as understood in modern portfolio theory, and the similarity of the investments of different funds. We show that, on average, portfolios have become more diversified and less similar during the crisis. However, we also find that large overlap is far more likely than expected from benchmark models of random allocation of investments. This indicates the existence of strong correlations between fund investment strategies. We exploit a deliberately simplified model of shock propagation to identify a systemic risk component stemming from the similarity of portfolios. The network is still partially vulnerable after the crisis because of this effect, despite the increase in the diversification of multi asset portfolios. Diversification and similarity should be taken into account jointly to properly assess systemic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2946651059,"Tauopathies represent a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by abnormal deposition of the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. Chronic neuroinflammation in tauopathies is driven by glial cells that potentially trigger the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Pro-inflammatory signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules produced by glial cells, neurons and endothelial cells, in general, cooperate to determine the integrity of BBB by influencing vascular permeability, enhancing migration of immune cells and altering transport systems. We considered the effect of tau about vascular permeability of peripheral blood cells in vitro and in vivo using primary rat BBB model and transgenic rat model expressing misfolded truncated protein tau. Immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and transcriptomic analysis were employed to characterize the structural and functional changes in BBB manifested by neurofibrillary pathology in a transgenic model. Our results show that misfolded protein tau ultimately modifies the endothelial properties of BBB, facilitating blood-to-brain cell transmigration. Our results suggest that the increased diapedesis of peripheral cells across the BBB, in response to tau protein, could be mediated by the increased expression of endothelial signaling molecules, namely ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and selectins. We suggest that the compensation of BBB in the diseased brain represents a crucial factor in neurodegeneration of human tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2945820665,"Purpose We aim to assess if air pollution levels and climatological factors are associated with hospital admissions for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Spain from 2004 to 2013. Methods We conducted a retrospective study. Information on pollution level and climatological factors were obtained from the Spanish Meteorological Agency and hospitalizations from the Spanish hospital discharge database. A case-crossover design was used to identify factors associated with hospitalizations and in hospital mortality. Postal codes were used to assign climatic and pollutant factors to each patient. Results We detected 162,338 hospital admissions for COPD exacerbation. When seasonal effects were evaluated we observed that hospital admissions and mortality were more frequent in autumn and winter. In addition, we found significant associations of temperature, humidity, ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter up to 10 μm in size (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with hospital admissions. Lower temperatures at admission with COPD exacerbation versus 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 weeks prior to hospital admission for COPD exacerbation, were associated with a higher probability of dying in the hospital. Other environmental factors that were related to in-hospital mortality were NO2, O3, PM10 and CO. Conclusions Epidemiology of hospital admissions by COPD exacerbation was negatively affected by colder climatological factors (seasonality and absolute temperature) and short-term exposure to major air pollution (NO2, O3, CO and PM10)."

We introduce and analyze a collection of 3.9 million tweets mentioning Zika geolocated to North and South America, where the virus is most prevalent. Using a multilingual topic model, we automatically identify and extract the key topics of discussion across the dataset in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. We examine the variation in Twitter activity across time and location, finding that rises in activity tend to follow to major events, and geographic rates of Zika-related discussion are moderately correlated with Zika incidence (ρ = .398)."
https://openalex.org/W2945512305,"Managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies are kept at much greater densities than naturally occurring feral or wild colonies, which may have detrimental effects on colony health and survival, disease spread, and drifting behavior (bee movement between natal and non-natal colonies). We assessed the effects of a straightforward apiary management intervention (altering the density and visual appearance of colonies) on colony health. Specifically, we established three ""high density / high drift"" (""HD"") and three ""low density / low drift"" (""LD"") apiary configurations, each consisting of eight bee colonies. Hives in the HD apiary configuration were of the same color and placed 1m apart in a single linear array, while hives in the LD apiary configuration were placed 10m apart at different heights, facing outwards in a circle, and made visually distinctive with colors and symbols to reduce accidental drift between colonies. We investigated disease transmission and dynamics between the apiary configurations by clearing all colonies of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor, and subsequently inoculating two randomly-chosen colonies per apiary with controlled mite doses. We monitored the colonies for two years and found that the LD apiary configuration had significantly greater honey production and reduced overwinter mortality. Inoculation and apiary management intervention interacted to affect brood mite levels, with the highest levels in the inoculated colonies in the HD configuration. Finally, foragers were more than three times more likely to drift in the HD apiary configurations. Our results suggest that a relatively straightforward management change-placing colonies in low-density visually complex circles rather than high-density visually similar linear arrays-can provide meaningful benefits to the health and productivity of managed honey bee colonies."
https://openalex.org/W2946468445,"Background Older adults with dementia are at a high risk of losing abilities and of accidental falls. Promoting Activity, Independence and Stability in Early Dementia (PrAISED) is a 12-month person-centred exercise and activity programme which aims to increase activity and independence whilst reducing falls in people with early dementia. In this patient group, as well as many others, poor adherence to exercise interventions can undermine treatment effectiveness. We aimed to explore patterns of barriers and facilitators influencing PrAISED participants’ adherence to home-based strength and balance exercises. Methods Participants were a subsample of 20 individuals with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia and their carer(s) taking part in the PrAISED programme. Participants (with the support of a carer where necessary) kept a daily exercise diary. Participants’ adherence were categorised based upon reported number of times a week they undertook the PrAISED strength and balance exercises over a 4 month period (<3 times a week = low adherence, 3–4 = meeting adherence expectations, >5 = exceeding adherence expectations). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in month 4 of the PrAISED programme to explore barriers and facilitators to adherence. A mixture of deductive and inductive thematic analysis was employed with themes categorised using the Theoretical Domains Framework. Findings Participants completed on average 98 minutes of home-based strength and balance exercises per week, 3.8 sessions per week, for an average of 24 minutes per session. Five participants were categorised as exceeding adherence expectations, 7 as meeting adherence expectations, and 8 as low adherers. Analysis of interview data based on self-reported adherence revealed six interacting themes: 1) routine, 2) practical and emotional support, 3) memory support, 4) purpose, 5) past experiences of sport and exercise, and 6) belief in and experience of benefits. Conclusions Identifiable cognitive, psychological, and practical factors influence adherence to exercise, and should be addressed in future development of interventions with this population."
https://openalex.org/W2946821320,"Reduction of ecosystem connectivity has long-lasting impacts on food webs. Anadromous fish, which migrate from marine to freshwater ecosystems to complete reproduction, have seen their historically larger ecosystem role undercut by widespread riverine habitat fragmentation and other impacts mainly derived from anthropogenic sources. The result has been extensive extirpations and increased susceptibility to a suite of environmental factors that currently impede recovery. Under this present-day context of reduced productivity and connectivity, aggressive management actions and enforcement of catch limits including bycatch caps and complete moratoria on harvest have followed. What remains less understood are the implications of changes to food webs that co-occurred. What benefits restoration could provide in terms of ecosystem functioning in relation to economic costs associated with dam removal and remediation is unknown and can limit the scope and value of restoration activities. Here we employ, historical landscape-based biomass estimates of anadromous alosine for the first time in an ecosystem modeling of the Northeast US large marine ecosystem (LME), to evaluate the value of improving connectivity by measuring the increase in energy flow and population productivity. We compared a restored alosine model to a contemporary model, analyzing the impacts of the potential increase of connectivity between riverine and oceanic systems. There was the potential for a moderate biomass increase of piscivorous species with high economic value, including Atlantic cod, and for a major increase for species of conservation concern such as pelagic sharks, seabirds and marine mammals. Our study highlights the benefits of increased connectivity between freshwater and ocean ecosystems. We demonstrate the significant role anadromous forage fish could play in improving specific fisheries and overall ecosystem functioning, mainly through the diversification of species capable of transferring primary production to upper trophic levels, adding to benefits associated with their restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2945633067,"Nonsense mutations constitute ~10% of TP53 mutations in cancer. They introduce a premature termination codon that gives rise to truncated p53 protein with impaired function. The aminoglycoside G418 can induce TP53 premature termination codon readthrough and thus increase cellular levels of full-length protein. Small molecule phthalimide derivatives that can enhance the readthrough activity of G418 have also been described. To determine whether readthrough enhancers exist among drugs that are already approved for use in humans, we tested seven antimalarial drugs for readthrough of the common R213X TP53 nonsense mutation in HDQ-P1 breast cancer cells. Mefloquine induced no TP53 readthrough activity as a single agent but it strongly potentiated readthrough by G418. The two enantiomers composing pharmaceutical mefloquine potentiated readthrough to similar levels in HDQ-P1 cells and also in SW900, NCI-H1688 and HCC1937 cancer cells with different TP53 nonsense mutations. Exposure to G418 and mefloquine increased p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and P21 transcript levels following DNA damage, indicating p53 produced via readthrough was functional. Mefloquine does not appear to enhance readthrough via lysosomotropic effects as it did not significantly affect lysosomal pH, the cellular levels of G418 or its distribution in organellar or cytosolic fractions. The availability of a readthrough enhancer that is already approved for use in humans should facilitate study of the therapeutic potential of TP53 readthrough in preclinical cancer models."
https://openalex.org/W2946037736,"The framework of dynamical systems offers powerful tools to understand the relation between stability and variability in human cognition in general and in speech in particular. In the current paper, we propose a dynamical systems approach to the description of German nuclear pitch accents in focus marking to account for both the categorical as well as the continuous variation found in intonational data. We report on results from 27 native speakers and employ an attractor landscape to represent pitch accent types in terms of f0 measures in a continuous dimension. We demonstrate how the same system can account for both the categorical variation (relative stability of one prosodic category) as well as the continuous variation (detailed modifications within one prosodic category). The model is able to capture the qualitative aspects of focus marking such as falling vs. rising pitch accent types as well as the quantitative aspects such as less rising vs. more rising accents in one system by means of scaling a single parameter. Furthermore, speaker group specific strategies are analysed and modelled as differences in the scaling of this parameter. Thus, the model contributes to the ongoing debate about the relation between phonetics and phonology and the importance of variation in language and speech."
https://openalex.org/W2945730576,"Although cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) has a low incidence globally, this is extremely high in Northeast Thailand. The lack of both early detection measures and effective therapeutic drugs is the major problem for the poor prognosis of CCA patients. Based on regional knowledge, it would be advantageous to search for effective natural phyto-products for the treatment of CCA. Cardiospermum halicacabum L., Gomphrena celosioides Mart. and Scoparia dulcis L., very well-known medicinal herbs in Asian countries, were selected for the investigation of inhibitory effects on CCA cells. Of the three different ethanolic extracts, S. dulcis L extract showed most inhibitory effects on cell growth of CCA cell lines KKU-100 and KKU-213, at percentages of 56.06 and 74.76, respectively, compared to the untreated group after treatment with 250 μg/mL of extracts for 72 hrs. At 400 and 500 μg/mL of the extracts, the inhibitory effect of KKU-213 was indicated by a significant increase in the BAX/Bcl-2 ratio and cell membrane permeability. Moreover, metabolic profiling-based screening employed in the current study revealed a significant positive association between the lignin compound and a decrease in CCA cell viability. Our study suggests, for the first time, that ESD has the ability to inhibit CCA cell growth through the induction of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2946632890,"Objective This study aimed to screen lead compounds and medication candidates from drug library (ZINC database) which has potential agonist effect targeting STING protein. Methods and materials A series of computer-aided virtual screening techniques were utilized to identify potential agonists of STING. Structure-based screening using Libdock was carried out followed by ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) and toxicity prediction. Molecular docking was performed to demonstrate the binding affinity and mechanism between ligands and STING dimers. Molecular dynamic simulation was utilized to evaluate the stability of ligand-receptor complex. Finally, animal experiment was conducted to validate the effectiveness of selected compounds. Results Three novel natural compounds 1,2,3 (ZIN15149223, ZIN11616633 and ZIN01577210, respectively) from the ZINC15 database were found binding to STING with more favorable interaction energy. Also, they were predicted with less ames mutagenicity, rodent carcinogenicity, non-developmental toxic potential and tolerant with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). The ligand chemical structure analysis showed the three compounds were inborn axisymmetric, such chemical structures account for combining and activating process of STING protein dimers. The dynamic simulation analysis demonstrated that ZIN15149223-, ZIN11616633- and ZIN01577210-STING dimer complex had more favorable potential energy compared with amidobenzimidazole (ABZI) and they can exist in natural environments stably. Animal experiments also demonstrated that these three compounds could suppress tumor growth. Conclusion This study demonstrates that ZIN15149223, ZIN11616633 and ZIN01577210 are potential agonists targeting STING protein. These compounds are safe drug candidates and have a great significance in STING agonists development."
https://openalex.org/W2945718111,"Highly efficacious and tolerable treatments that cure hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection exist today, increasing the feasibility of disease elimination. However, large healthcare systems may not be fully prepared for supporting recommended actions due to knowledge gaps, inadequate infrastructure and uninformed policy direction. Additionally, the HCV cascade of care is complex, with many embedded barriers, and a significant number of patients do not progress through the cascade and are thus not cured. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate a large healthcare system's HCV screening rates, linkage to care efficiency, and provider testing preferences. Patients born during 1945-1965, not previously HCV positive or tested from within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), were identified given that three-quarters of HCV-infected persons in the United States are from this Birth Cohort (BC). In building this HCV testing EHR prompt, non-Birth Cohort patients were excluded as HCV-specific risk factors identifying this population were not usually captured in searchable, structured data fields. Once completed, the BC prompt was released to primary care locations. From July 2015 through December 2016, 11.5% of eligible patients (n = 9,304/80,556) were HCV antibody tested (anti-HCV), 3.8% (353/9,304) anti-HCV positive, 98.1% (n = 311/317) HCV RNA tested, 59.8% (n = 186/311) HCV RNA positive, 86.6% (161/186) referred and 76.4% (n = 123/161) seen by a specialist, and 34.1% (n = 42/123) cured of their HCV. Results from the middle stages of the cascade in this large healthcare system are encouraging; however, entry into the cascade-HCV testing-was performed for only 11% of the birth cohort, and the endpoint-HCV cure-accounted for only 22% of all infected. Action is needed to align current practice with recommendations for HCV testing and treatment given that these are significant barriers toward elimination."
https://openalex.org/W2946619381,"Aim To determine the association of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR), waist to height ratio (WHtr) and Body Shape Index (ABSI) with high cardiovascular risk (CVR), as well as to determine whether how strong are these relationships. Material and methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in Spanish Caucasian adults. 3,456 subjects completed the study, 45.78% males, aged < 65 years and non-diabetic subjects. Anthropometric/biochemical variables were measured. We determined ABSI based on WC adjusted for height and weight. High CVR was defined as ≥ 20% according to the Framingham chart, ≥ 5% with the SCORE chart, and ≥ 7.5% with the ACC/AHA guide. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were estimated for each anthropometric measure. Results Most significant AUCs in males were: WHtr and ABSI for Framingham ≥ 20% and SCORE ≥ 5%. Also significant were WHtr, WC and ABSI for ACCA/AHA ≥ 7.5%. On the other hand, most significant AUCs in females were: WHtr and WC for Framingham ≥ 20%; and WHtr and WHR for SCORE ≥ 5%, WHtr, and WC for ACC/AHA guide ≥ 7.5%. Conclusions Overall, the best anthropometric index identifying Spanish males and females who are at high risk for CV events is WHtr. ABSI was also found to be a good anthropometric index to predict high CVR in Spanish males according to FR, SCORE and ACC/AHA charts. For Spanish females, WC is a good anthropometric index according to FR and ACC/AHA guide, while WHR is better according to SCORE."
https://openalex.org/W2945497192,"MiR-873/CDK3 has been shown to play a critical role in ERα signaling and tamoxifen resistance. Thus, targeting this pathway may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of ER positive breast cancer especially tamoxifen resistant subtype. Here we report that Norcantharidin (NCTD), currently used clinically as an ani-cancer drug in China, regulates miR-873/CDK3 axis in breast cancer cells. NCTD decreases the transcriptional activity of ERα but not ERβ through the modulation of miR-873/CDK3 axis. We also found that NCTD inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth and miR-873/CDK3 axis mediates cell proliferation suppression of NCTD. More important, we found that NCTD sensitizes resistant cells to tamoxifen. NCTD inhibits tamoxifen induced the transcriptional activity as well ERα downstream gene expressions in tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cells. In addition, we found that NCTD restores tamoxifen induced recruitments of ERα co-repressors N-CoR and SMRT. Knockdown of miR-873 and overexpression of CDK3 diminish the effect of NCTD on tamoxifen resistance. Our data shows that NCTD regulates ERα signaling and tamoxifen resistance by targeting miR-873/CDK3 axis in breast cancer cells. This study may provide an alternative therapy strategy for tamoxifen resistant breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2946789041,"Risk-taking is a complex form of decision-making that involves calculated assessments of potential costs and rewards that may be immediate or delayed. Thus, making predictions about inter-individual variation in risk-taking due to personality traits, decision styles or other attributes can be difficult. The association of risk-taking with gender is well-supported; males report higher propensity for risk-taking and show higher risk-taking on tasks measuring actual risk-taking behavior. Risk-taking also appears to be associated with circadian phenotypes (chronotypes), with evening-types reporting higher levels of risk-taking—but this association may be confounded by the fact that, in certain age groups, males are more likely to be evening-types. Here, we test for gender by chronotype effects on risk-taking in young adults (n = 610) using a self-reported risk propensity questionnaire, the health domain of the DOSPERT, and a behavioral task measuring risk-taking, the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART). Our results show that males report and take significantly more risks than females in this population. In addition, evening-type individuals have significantly higher self-reported risk propensity and tend to take more risks on the BART. Interestingly, there is no significant difference in risk propensity or risk-taking behavior across male circadian phenotypes, but evening-type females significantly report and take more risk than female intermediate and morning types. In regression analyses, we found both gender and chronotype predict risk propensity and risk-taking. Path analysis confirms that chronotype has an indirect effect on gender differences in both risk propensity and risk-taking. Furthermore, we found that trait anxiety (STAI) and sleep disturbance (PROMIS), significantly correlate with chronotype and gender in the complete dataset, but do not independently predict differences in female risk-taking. These results suggest that chronotype mediates gender effects on risk-taking and that these effects are driven primarily by morning-type females, but are not related to gender-specific differences in trait anxiety or sleep quality."
https://openalex.org/W2946582671,"Background Cancer patients undergoing Doxorubicin (DOX) treatment are susceptible to acute and chronic cardiac anomalies, including aberrant arrhythmias, ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure. To stratify patients at high risk for DOX -related heart failure (CHF), diagnostic techniques have been sought. While echocardiography is used for monitoring LVEF and LV volumes due to its wide-availability and cost-efficiency, it may not identify early stages of the initiation of DOX-induced systolic heart failure. To address these limitations, PET tracers could also provide noninvasive assessment of early and reversible metabolic changes of the myocardium. Objective Herein, we report a preliminary investigation of 68Ga-Galmydar potential to monitor Dox-induced cardiomyopathy in vivo, ex vivo, and in cellulo employing both nuclear- and optical imaging. Methods and results To assess 68Ga-Galmydar ability for monitoring DOX-induced cardiomyopathy, microPET imaging was performed 5 d post treatment of rats either with a single dose of DOX (15 mg/kg) or vehicle as a control (saline) and images were co-registered for anatomical reference using CT. Following tail-vein injection of the radiotracer in rats at 60 min, micro-PET/CT static scan (10 min acquisition), 68Ga-Galmydar demonstrated 1.91-fold lower uptake in hearts of DOX-treated (standard uptake value; SUV: 0.92, n = 3) rats compared with their vehicle treated (SUV: 1.76, n = 3) control counterparts. For correlation of PET imaging data, post-imaging quantitative biodistribution studies were also performed, wherein excised organs were counted for γ activity, and normalized to injected dose. The post imaging pharmacokinetic data also demonstrated heart uptake values of 2.0 fold lower for DOX treated rats(%ID/g; DOX: 0.44 ± 0.1, n = 3) compared to their vehicle-treated controls (%ID/g; Control: 0.89 ± 0.03, n = 3, p = 0.04). Employing the fluorescent traits of Galmydar, live cell fluorescence imaging indicated a gradual decrease in uptake and retention of Galmydar within mitochondria of H9c2 cells following DOX-treatment, while indicating dose-dependent and time-dependent uptake profiles. Following depolarization of electronegative transmembrane gradients at the mitochondrial membrane, the uptake of the probe was decreased in H9c2 cells, and the uptake profiles were found to be identical, using both fluorescence and radiotracer bioassays. Finally, the decreased uptake of the metalloprobe in H9c2 cells also correlated with caspase-3 expression resulting from DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and cell death. Conclusions 68Ga-Galmydar could provide a noninvasive assessment of DOX-related and likely reversible metabolic changes at earliest stages. Further studies with other chemotherapeutics (potentially capable of inducing cardiomyopathy) are underway."
https://openalex.org/W2946804359,"Application of Bacillus cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs); fengycin, iturin A and surfactin has shown a great potential in controlling the spread of green mold pathogen invasion (Penicillium digitatum) in wounded mandarin fruit during postharvest period. The limited defensive protein profiles followed specific expression of pivotal genes relating to plant hormone mediating signaling pathways of the CLPs' action on stimulating host plant resistance have been exhibited. The present study aimed to elucidate the specific effect of individual CLP obtained from Bacillus subtilis ABS-S14 as elicitor role on activation of plant defensive system at transcriptional and proteomic levels with and without P. digitatum co-application in mandarin fruit. Fengycin and iturin A elevated the gene expression of PAL, ACS1, ACO, CHI, and GLU while significantly stimulating plant POD transcription was only detected in the treatments of surfactin both with and without following P. digitatum. An increase of LOX and PR1 gene transcripts was determined in the treatments of individual CLP with fungal pathogen co-application. Fengycin activated production of unique defensive proteins such as protein involved in ubiquinone biosynthetic process in treated flavedo without P. digitatum infection. Proteins involved in the auxin modulating pathway were present in the iturin A and surfactin treatments. CLP-protein binding assay following proteome analysis reveals that iturin A attached to 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 2 involved in the oxylipin biosynthetic process required for jasmonic acid production which is implicated in induced systemic resistance (ISR). This study suggests specific elicitor action of individual CLP, particularly iturin A showed the most powerful in stimulating the ISR system in response to stresses in postharvest mandarins."
https://openalex.org/W2945338219,"In this work, a synchronization scheme for networks of complex systems is presented. The proposed synchronization scheme uses a control law obtained with some definitions from graph theory and solving the Model-Matching Problem for complex networks. In particular, Rössler, Chen, Lorenz and Lü chaotic systems are used as complex chaotic systems into complex networks. Particular cases with regular and irregular networks of six identical chaotic systems are implemented, with some well-known topologies as star and ring small-world, and tree topologies. Highlighting, the obtained control law is applied to synchronize an irregular network of six different chaotic systems in a tree topology. The usefulness and advantages of the proposed synchronization scheme are highlighted performing numerical simulations of the chaotic complex networks."
https://openalex.org/W2945410544,"There is ongoing debate on whether object meaning can be processed outside foveal vision, making semantics available for attentional guidance. Much of the debate has centred on whether objects that do not fit within an overall scene draw attention, in complex displays that are often difficult to control. Here, we revisited the question by reanalysing data from three experiments that used displays consisting of standalone objects from a carefully controlled stimulus set. Observers searched for a target object, as per auditory instruction. On the critical trials, the displays contained no target but objects that were semantically related to the target, visually related, or unrelated. Analyses using (generalized) linear mixed-effects models showed that, although visually related objects attracted most attention, semantically related objects were also fixated earlier in time than unrelated objects. Moreover, semantic matches affected the very first saccade in the display. The amplitudes of saccades that first entered semantically related objects were larger than 5° on average, confirming that object semantics is available outside foveal vision. Finally, there was no semantic capture of attention for the same objects when observers did not actively look for the target, confirming that it was not stimulus-driven. We discuss the implications for existing models of visual cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2945476000,"Many receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs, such as EGFR, MET) are negatively regulated by ubiquitination and degradation mediated by Cbl proteins, a family of RING finger (RF) ubiquitin ligases (E3s). Loss of Cbl protein function is associated with malignant transformation driven by increased RTK activity. RF E3s, such as the Cbl proteins, interact with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) to confer specificity to the ubiquitination process and direct the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to one or more lysines on the target proteins. Using in vitro E3 assays and yeast two-hybrid screens, we found that Ube2d, Ube2e families, Ube2n/2v1, and Ube2w catalyze autoubiquitination of the Cbl protein and Ube2d2, Ube2e1, and Ube 2n/2v1 catalyze Cbl-mediated substrate ubiquitination of the EGFR and SYK. Phosphorylation of the Cbl protein by by Src resulted in increased E3 activity compared to unphosphorylated cbl or Cbl containing a phosphomimetic Y371E mutation. Ubiquitin chain formation depended on the E2 tested with Cbl with Ube2d2 forming both K48 and K63 linked chains, Ube2n/2v1 forming only K63 linked chains, and Ube2w inducing monoubiquitination. In cells, the Ube2d family, Ube2e family, and Ube2n/2v1 contributed to EGFR ubiquitination. Our data suggest that multiple E2s can interact with Cbl and modulate its E3 activity in vitro and in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2945695834,"Recent studies indicate that FoxO1 has roles in female reproductive system, especially in maternal endometrium. Although various cellular aspects and molecular pathways have been identified, the exact molecular characteristics of embryo implantation are still not completely understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate uterine expression and regulation of FoxO1 during peri-implantation period in mice. Experimental mouse models including, normal pregnancy, pseudopregnancy, artificial decidualization, and delayed implantation and activation were performed. Our results showed that FoxO1 expression was spatiotemporal in mouse endometrial tissue throughout peri-implantation period and its expression was significantly upregulated in luminal and glandular epithelium at the time of implantation. Moreover, on day 5 morning (09:00 AM) of pregnancy, expression of FoxO1 was cytoplasmic in endometrial luminal epithelial cells where embryo homing takes place. With progressing time on day 5 evening (19:00 PM) of pregnancy FoxO1 expression was nuclear in luminal epithelium at implantation site. Pseudopregnancy and artificial decidualization models indicated that FoxO1 expression was regulated by pregnancy hormones. Delayed implantation and activation model indicated that FoxO1 expression at the time of implantation is dependent upon activation status of blastocyst due to E2 induction and uterine sensitivity to implantation. In conclusion, our findings highlight a perspective for FoxO1 expression and regulation in mouse uterus during peri-implantation period indicating that its expression is regulated by implanting embryo and pregnancy hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2945555174,"Metal tolerant bacterium Chryseobacterium sp. PMSZPI previously isolated and characterized from uranium ore deposit was studied for elucidating the role of metal transporter genes belonging to the Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF), Root-Nodulation-Division (RND) and PIB-type ATPase family in cadmium and uranium tolerance. The bacterium showed tolerance towards cadmium (MIC~6mM) and uranium (MIC~2mM) and was found to harbor metal transporter genes belonging to CDF, RND and PIB-type ATPase family of proteins. Expression studies by real-time PCR showed an upregulation of czcA(RND), czcD(CDF) and cadA(PIB-type ATPase) genes in presence of cadmium or uranium. Higher expression of czcA and czcD was found when the bacterium was treated with cadmium and uranium respectively. This study provides significant insight into the molecular mechanism that plays a role in cadmium and uranium tolerance in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2945358523,"CD4+ effector/memory T cells (Tem) represent a leading edge of the adaptive immune system responsible for protecting the body from infection, cancer, and other damaging processes. However, a subset of Tem cells with low expression of CD45Rb (RbLoTem) has been shown to suppress inflammation despite their effector surface phenotype and the lack of FoxP3 expression, the canonical transcription factor found in most regulatory T cells. In this report, we show that RbLoTem cells can suppress inflammation by influencing Treg behavior. Co-culturing activated RbLoTem and Tregs induced high expression of IL-10 in vitro, and conditioned media from RbLoTem cells induced IL-10 expression in FoxP3+ Tregs in vitro and in vivo, indicating that RbLoTem cells communicate with Tregs in a cell-contact independent fashion. Transcriptomic and multi-analyte Luminex data identified both IL-2 and IL-4 as potential mediators of RbLoTem-Treg communication, and antibody-mediated neutralization of either IL-4 or CD124 (IL-4Rα) prevented IL-10 induction in Tregs. Moreover, isolated Tregs cultured with recombinant IL-2 and IL-4 strongly induced IL-10 production. Using house dust mite (HDM)-induced airway inflammation as a model, we confirmed that the in vivo suppressive activity of RbLoTem cells was lost in IL-4-ablated RbLoTem cells. These data support a model in which RbLoTem cells communicate with Tregs using a combination of IL-2 and IL-4 to induce robust expression of IL-10 and suppression of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2945630737,"The maximum entropy model, a commonly used species distribution model (SDM) normally combines observations of the species occurrence with environmental information to predict the geographic distributions of animal or plant species. However, it only produces point estimates for the probability of species existence. To understand the uncertainty of the point estimates, we analytically derived the variance of the outputs of the maximum entropy model from the variance of the input. We applied the analytic method to obtain the standard deviation of dengue importation probability and Aedes aegypti suitability. Dengue occurrence data and Aedes aegypti mosquito abundance data, combined with demographic and environmental data, were applied to obtain point estimates and the corresponding variance. To address the issue of not having the true distributions for comparison, we compared and contrasted the performance of the analytical expression with the bootstrap method and Poisson point process model which proved of equivalence of maximum entropy model with the assumption of independent point locations. Both Dengue importation probability and Aedes aegypti mosquito suitability examples show that the methods generate comparatively the same results and the analytic method we introduced is dramatically faster than the bootstrap method and directly apply to maximum entropy model."
https://openalex.org/W2946703551,"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an infectious disease that affects mostly children. The children with HFMD also have other immune and metabolic disorders. However, the association of these disorders with the severity of HFMD has not yet been determined. In this study, we used a case-control study design to examine the correlation of immune and metabolic disorders with HFMD development in children. 406 mild and severe patients were recruited and divided into different subgroups based on the number of days from the initial onset time to hospitalization (1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥5 days). Logistic regression model was used to define the predictors of severe HFMD. We found that the patients from rural area (OR = 1.76, 95% CI [1.19~2.63], P = 0.005) or with body temperature of >39°C (OR = 2.14, 95% CI [1.12~4.12], P = 0.022) exhibited higher risk for severe symptoms. In addition, the risk increased with the rise of body temperature by using a Chis-quare trend test (P = 0.01). We also found that a decreased number of eosinophils was an predictor of severe HFMD at 1, 2, 3,and 4 days post infection (dpi). Decreased levels of Na+, Cl-, and creatine kinase were also predictors at 1 and ≥5 dpi. On the other hand, elevated level of globulin was a predictor for severe HFMD at 4 dpi and ≥5 dpi, and the increased number of neutrophils or increased level of alkaline phosphatase posed risk for severe HFMD at 3 and ≥5 dpi. Our results suggested that rural living, hyperpyrexia, changes in the immune system that include the numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils and the levels of IgG and globulin, and metabolic alterations, such as the levels of alkaline phosphatase, Na+, Cl-, and creatine kinase in peripheral blood are predictors of severe HFMD."
https://openalex.org/W2945083031,"In order to improve the monitoring and prediction of coal and gas outburst, this paper proposes a new method for dynamic regional prediction of coal and gas outburst using microseismic (MS) monitoring. The theoretical basis of this method is presented. An index evaluation system was established and applied, based on which field tests were carried out in a coal mine. The results show that seismic monitoring with frequency and energy indexes can obtain good results for mining disturbance intensity monitoring and geological structure detection; the regional stress distribution detected by seismic wave tomography is consistent with the theoretical stress field, making its use of great significance for optimizing coal and gas outburst drilling parameters and improving overall tunneling efficiency. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods in the temporal and spatial dimensions and realizes dynamic and continuous monitoring of coal and gas outburst-prone areas."
https://openalex.org/W2945171677,"Background A link between angina with no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction has been proposed, but evidence in support of this is lacking. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated whether left ventricular diastolic function in women with angina pectoris and no obstructive CAD differed from a reference population. Methods We included 956 women with angina and <50% coronary artery stenosis at invasive coronary angiography. Women with cardiovascular risk factors, but no history of chest pain or cardiac disease served as controls (n = 214). Left ventricular diastolic function was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography. Results The women with angina were slightly older, had higher body mass index, higher heart rate, and more had diabetes compared with controls while systolic blood pressure was lower. In age-adjusted analyses, angina patients had significantly lower E/A (Estimated difference -0.13, 95% CI: -0.17; -0.08), higher left ventricular mass index (5.73 g/m2, 95% CI: 3.71; 7.75), left atrial volume index (2.34 ml/m2, 95% CI: 1.23; 3.45) and E/e’ (0.68, 95% CI: 0.30; 1.05) and a larger proportion had higher estimated left ventricular filling pressure (17% versus 6%, p = 0.001). No between group differences were seen for e’ or deceleration time. After adjustment for known cardiovascular risk factors, between group differences for echocardiographic parameters remained statistically significant. Conclusions Patients with angina and no obstructive CAD had a more impaired left ventricular diastolic function compared with an asymptomatic reference population. This suggests some common pathophysiological pathway between the two syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2945747405,"In social animals, morphological and behavioural traits may give to some individuals a stronger influence on the collective decisions, even in groups assumed to be leaderless such as fish shoals. Here, we studied and characterized the leadership in collective movements of shoals of zebrafish Danio rerio by observing groups of 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 zebrafish swimming in a two resting sites arena during one hour. We quantified the number of collective departures initiated by each fish and the number of attempts that they made. To do so, we developed an automated pipeline that analysed the individual trajectories generated by the tracking software. For all shoal sizes, the leadership was distributed among several individuals. However, it was equally shared among all the fish in some shoals while other groups showed a more asymmetrical sharing of the initiation of collective departures. To quantify this distribution, we computed the entropy associated with the time series of the identity of all initiators for each experiment and confirmed the presence of a continuum between a homogeneous and a heterogeneous distribution of the leadership. While some fish led more departures than others, an individual analysis showed that all fish had actually the same success rate to lead the shoal out of a resting site after an attempt. Thus, some individuals monopolized the leadership by attempting more often than others to exit a resting site. Finally, we highlight that the intra-group ranking of a fish for the initiative is correlated to its intra-group ranking for the average speed with mobile individuals more prone to lead the shoal. These results demonstrate that the collective behaviour of a shoal can be mainly driven by a subset of individuals even in the absence of higher influence of a fish on its congeneers."
https://openalex.org/W2945636389,"Semen analysis is one of the standard diagnostic tools currently used to assess male infertility and reproductive toxicity. However, semen analysis has a limited ability to separate fertile from infertile populations. Additional methods to detect impaired fertility are needed. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate how spermatozoal RNA content varies with sociodemographic and behavior/lifestyle factors, and to determine if spermatozoal large and small RNAs discriminate normal from abnormal spermatozoa. Semen specimens were collected from 133 men aged between 18 to 55 years undergoing semen analysis as part of couple infertility evaluation while 10 proven fertile donors were recruited as control group. Semen samples were classified as normal or abnormal according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 criteria. Sperm RNAs were extracted after somatic cells were lysed, and the association of large or small RNA content with semen quality and sociodemographic and behavioral/lifestyle factors was evaluated using a generalized additive model and one-way ANOVA. Inverse relationship was observed between large RNA content and sperm parameters such as sperm count, density and motility. Large RNA content per sperm was significantly increased in semen samples showing abnormal number of round cells. Furthermore, sperm motility was inversely associated with spermatozoal small RNA contents. Grouping donors by the number of semen abnormalities, we observed significant increased spermatozoal large and small RNA content in men with more than two semen abnormalities. Alcohol consumption was strongly associated with increased large RNA per sperm concentration after adjustment for age and BMI. Our study demonstrates a strong relationship between spermatozoal large RNA content and poor semen characteristics that may lead to a role in the assessment of male fertility, and may be used as an endpoint for reproductive toxicology risk assessment."

Fusion and integrase inhibitors are supposed to be safer, but have been scarcely investigated. To avoid any interference with HIV or other antiretrovirals, we assessed markers of these toxicities in healthy adult volunteers treated with Enfuvirtide (T20) or Raltegravir (RAL). Methods Twenty-six healthy participants were randomized to T20/90mg vs. placebo (n = 12) or RAL/400mg vs. placebo (n = 14) every 12h in two 7-day periods separated by a 4-week washout period. Major end-points were changes in lipid profile (total cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides), insulin resistance (glucose) and mitochondrial toxicity (mitochondrial DNA content–mtDNA–in peripheral blood mononuclear cells). Renal and hepatic toxicity (creatinine, alanine transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin and total plasma proteins) and overall safety were also analysed. Effect of period, treatment, and basal measures were evaluated for each end-point. Results Neither T20-administration nor RAL-administration yielded to any statistic significant change in the markers of metabolic, mitochondrial, renal or hepatic toxicity assessed. No symptoms indicative of drug toxicity were neither found in any subject. Conclusions In absence of HIV infection, or concomitant treatment, short-term exposure to T20 or RAL in healthy adult volunteers did not lead to any indicative changes in toxicity markers thus presuming the safe profile of both drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2945359292,"The colder regions of Earth are inhabited by cold-adapted microorganisms designated as psychrophiles that are known to produce cold-active enzymes, such as peptidases, chaperones, lipases, cellulases, and phosphatases. These types of enzymes are a major part of the market of industrial enzymes. Bacteria isolated from water samples collected from the Chamba region in the Himalayas were screened for peptidase production using skim milk agar plates. Among the peptidase-producing bacteria isolated, 20% of the isolates exhibited fast growth and maximum zones of clearance, and thus, were used for further studies. The 16S rDNA sequence analysis of isolate S1DI 10 identified it as a Bacillus sp. The peptidase was cloned in pET28a vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and the His-tagged recombinant protein was purified using Ni-NTA column. The purified peptidase of SIDI 10 was found to be an alkaline, cold-active peptidase with optimal enzyme activity at 10°C and pH 8. An approach of one variable at a time was used to further study the effect of various metal ions, organic solvents and detergents on the peptidase enzyme. The peptidase activity was enhanced in the presence of Fe2+ and Mn2+ (metal ions), hexane (organic solvent), SDS- sodium dodecyl sulfate (anionic detergent) and Tween 80 (nonionic detergent). Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the cumulative effect of these five variables. A 25 full factorial central composite design was applied for the five independent variables to determine the optimal combinations of these constituents at the maximum peptidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2944927676,"Background Preoperative cognitive reserve and brain integrity may explain commonly observed intraoperative fluctuations seen on a standard anesthesia depth monitor used ubiquitously in operating rooms throughout the nation. Neurophysiological variability indicates compromised regulation and organization of neural networks. Based on theories of neuronal integrity changes that accompany aging, we assessed the relative contribution of: 1) premorbid cognitive reserve, 2) current brain integrity (gray and white matter markers of neurodegenerative disease), and 3) current cognition (specifically domains of processing speed/working memory, episodic memory, and motor function) on intraoperative neurophysiological variability as measured from a common intraoperative tool, the Bispectral Index Monitor (BIS). Methods This sub-study included participants from a parent study of non-demented older adults electing unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) with the same surgeon and anesthesia protocol, who also completed a preoperative neuropsychological assessment and preoperative 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Left frontal two-channel derived EEG via the BIS was acquired preoperatively (un-medicated and awake) and continuously intraoperatively with time from tourniquet up to tourniquet down. Data analyses used correlation and regression modeling. Results Fifty-four participants met inclusion criteria for the sub-study. The mean (SD) age was 69.5 (7.4) years, 54% were male, 89% were white, and the mean (SD) American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 2.76 (0.47). We confirmed that brain integrity positively and significantly associated with each of the cognitive domains of interest. EEG intra-individual variability (squared deviation from the mean BIS value between tourniquet up and down) was significantly correlated with cognitive reserve (r = -.40, p = .003), brain integrity (r = -.37, p = .007), and a domain of processing speed/working memory (termed cognitive efficiency; r = -.31, p = .021). Hierarchical regression models that sequentially included age, propofol bolus dose, cognitive reserve, brain integrity, and cognitive efficiency found that intraoperative propofol bolus dose (p = .001), premorbid cognitive reserve (p = .008), and current brain integrity (p = .004) explained a significant portion of intraoperative intra-individual variability from the BIS monitor. Conclusions Older adults with higher premorbid reserve and less brain disease were more stable intraoperatively on a depth of anesthesia monitor. Researchers need to replicate findings within larger cohorts and other surgery types."

The aim of this study was to obtain 3D facial anthropometric data of Congolese children aged 0-5 years.The faces of 287 Congolese children were successfully scanned using a portable structured-light based 3D video camera, suitable for field work in low- income settings. The images were analyzed using facial analysis algorithms. Normal growth curves were generated for the following facial dimensions: distance between nares and distance from subnasion to upper lip. At birth, 1 year, and 5 years of age the median dimensions were: 13·92, 14·66, and 17.60 mm, respectively for distance between nares, and 10·16, 10.88, and 13·79 mm, respectively for distance from subnasion to upper lip. Modeled facial contours conveniently clustered into three average sizes which could be used as templates for the design of medical instruments.Capturing of 3D images of infants and young children in LMICs is feasible using portable cameras and computerized analysis.

The aim of this study was to describe the endoscopic findings in children who presented to the paediatric gastroenterology unit of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) with RAP.This was a prospective descriptive study which was conducted from January 2015 to July 2018 at the Paediatric Gastroenterology unit of the department of Paediatrics and the endoscopy unit of the LUTH, Lagos, Nigeria. All children and adolescents ≤ 19 years old with recurrent abdominal pain who were referred for upper GI endoscopy during the study period, were recruited. Baseline sociodemographic data, dyspepsia and alarm symptoms if present were documented. Results of other investigations namely stool examination for ova, parasites, occult blood and faecal antigen for Helicobacter pylori and abdominal scan were also documented.A total of 113 children with recurrent abdominal pain was referred during the study period and 87 (76.7%) of them had upper GI endoscopy done. Out of the participants, 38(43.7%) were boys and 49(56.3) girls. Alarm features were present in 15(17.6%) and dyspepsia was seen in 22(25.3%) of the subjects. The main endoscopic findings were: gastritis in 39 (44.8%), gastric erosions in 14(16.2%), hiatus hernia in 7(8.1%), duodenitis in 6 (6.9%), gastric polyp in 4 (4.6%).Upper GI endoscopy remains an invaluable tool in the tool in evaluating RAP in children as it enables accurate diagnosis of GI causes of RAP.

This study compared craniofacial morphology in the CNP-KO rat with that in the Spontaneous Dwarf Rat (SDR), a growth hormone (GH)-deficient model. The effects of subcutaneous administration of human CNP with 53 amino acids (CNP-53) from 5 weeks of age for 4 weeks on craniofacial morphology in CNP-KO rats were also investigated. Skulls of CNP-KO rats at 9 weeks of age were longitudinally shorter and the foramen magnum was smaller than WT rats. There were no differences in foramen magnum stenosis and midface hypoplasia between CNP-KO rats at 9 and 33 weeks of age. These morphological features were the same as those observed in CNP-KO mice and activated fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 achondroplasia-phenotype mice. In contrast, SDR did not exhibit foramen magnum stenosis and midface hypoplasia, despite shorter stature than in control rats. After administration of exogenous CNP-53, the longitudinal skull length and foramen magnum size in CNP-KO rats were significantly greater, and full or partial rescue was confirmed. The synchondrosis at the cranial base in CNP-KO rats is closed at 9 weeks, but not at 4 weeks of age. In contrast, synchondrosis closure in CNP-KO rats treated with CNP-53 was incomplete at 9 weeks of age. Administration of exogenous CNP-53 accelerated craniofacial skeletogenesis, leading to improvement in craniofacial morphology. As these findings in CNP-KO rats are similar to those in patients with achondroplasia, treatment with CNP-53 or a CNP analog may be able to restore craniofacial morphology and foramen magnum size as well as short stature."
https://openalex.org/W2946087809,"In western countries, men who have sex with men (MSM) are most affected by HIV and increasingly likely to engage in risky sexual behaviour. MSM who experience a potential sexual exposure to HIV (PEPSE) and receive a preventative regimen of anti-HIV treatment are at particularly high risk of acquiring HIV and could potentially benefit from targeted risk reduction behavioural interventions such as motivational interviewing (MI).The aim of this trial was to examine the impact of augmented MI (MI plus information provision and behavioural skills building), over and above routine care, on reducing risky sexual behaviour in MSM prescribed PEPSE. Secondary aims of the research were to examine whether the intervention reduced sexually transmitted infections (STI) and further requests for PEP.A parallel-group pragmatic randomised controlled trial was conducted with 175 MSM recruited from five sexual health (SH) clinics in the south east of England. The intervention was two fixed-duration sessions of telephone administered augmented MI. A manual guided the selection of individualised persuasive communication strategies based on underlying change mechanisms specified by the Information, Motivation and Behavioural Skills (IMB) model. Primary outcomes were the number of receptive and active anal intercourse (AI) partners, the use of condoms every time during receptive and active AI and the use of condoms sometimes during receptive and active AI.There were no significant impacts on sexual risk behaviour or any of the psychological measures, and no discernible reduction in requests for repeat PEP or rates of STIs within a year.Our behavioural intervention of augmented MI did not affect risky sexual behaviour, rates of further PEP and STIs, and psychological factors, in MSM prescribed PEPSE.UKCRN ID:11436; ISRCTN00746242."
https://openalex.org/W2946502067,"Background Atypical intracerebral hemorrhage is a common form of primary manifestation of vascular malformations. Objective The aim of the present study is to determine clues to the cause of bleeding according to hemorrhage pattern (lobar, basal ganglia, infratentorial). Methods We retrospectively evaluated 343 consecutive neurosurgical patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), who were admitted to our neurosurgical department between 2006 and 2016. The study cohort includes only neurosurgical patients. Patients who underwent treatment by neurologists are not represented in this study. We assessed location of hemorrhage, hematoma volumes to rule out differences and predicitve variables for final outcome. Results In 171 cases (49.9%) vascular malformations, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), cavernomas, dural fistulas and aneurysms were the cause of bleeding. 172 (50.1%) patients suffered from an intracerebral hemorrhage due to amyloid angiopathy or long standing hypertension. In patients with infratentorial hemorrhage a malformation was more frequently detected as in patients with supratentorial hemorrhage (36% vs. 16%, OR 2.9 [1.8;4.9], p<0.001). Among the malformations AVMs were most common (81%). Hematoma expansion was smaller in vascular malformation than non-malformation caused bleeding (24.1 cm3 vs. 64.8 cm3, OR 0.5 [0.4;0.7], p < 0.001,). In 6 (2.1%) cases diagnosis remained unclear. Final outcome was more favorable in patients with vascular malformations (63% vs. 12%, OR 12.8 [4.5;36.2], p<0.001). Conclusion Localization and bleeding patterns are predictive factors for origin of the hemorrhage. These predictive factors should quickly lead to appropriate vascular diagnostic measures. However, due to the inclusion criteria the validity of the study is limited and multicentre studies with further testing in general ICH patients are required."
https://openalex.org/W2946583916,"Objectives Attractiveness judgements have been shown to affect interpersonal relationships. The present study explored the relationships between perceived attractiveness, perceived sexual health status, condom use intentions and condom use resistance in women. Setting The study data were collected using an online questionnaire. Participants 480 English-speaking women who have sex with men, between 18–32 years old. Outcome measures Women were asked to rate the attractiveness of 20 men on the basis of facial photographs, to estimate the likelihood that each man had a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and to indicate their willingness to have sex with each man without a condom. Condom resistance tactics were also measured and their influence on condom use intentions was assessed. Results The more attractive a man was judged to be, the more likely it was that participants were willing to have sex with him (r (478) = 0.987, p < .001). Further, the more attractive a man was judged to be, the less likely women were to intend to use a condom during sex (r = -0.552, df = 478, p = .007). The average perceived STI likelihood for a man had no significant association with his average perceived attractiveness or with participants’ average willingness to have sex with him. The more attractive a participant judged herself to be, the more she believed that, overall, men are likely to have a STI (r = 0.103, df = 478, p < .05). Conclusions Women’s perceptions of men’s attractiveness influence their condom use intentions; such risk biases should be incorporated into sexual health education programmes and condom use interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2946633567,"Influenza vaccination is proven effective in preventing influenza. However, long-term effects on mortality have never been supported by direct evidence. In this study we assessed the long-term outcome of influenza vaccination on mortality in the elderly by conducting a 25-year follow-up study of a RCT on the efficacy of influenza vaccination as baseline. The RCT had been conducted in the Netherlands 5 years before vaccination was recommended for those aged >65 and 17 years before recommending it for those aged >60. The RCT included 1838 community-dwelling elderly aged ≥ 60 that had received an intramuscular injection with the inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (n = 927) or placebo (n = 911) during the 1991/1992 winter. In our follow-up study, outcomes included all-cause mortality, influenza-related mortality and seasonal mortality. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by Cox regression and sub-hazard ratios (SHRs) by competing risk models. Secondary analyses included subgroup analyses by age and disease status. The vital status up to January 1, 2017 was provided in 1800/1838 (98%) of the cases. Single influenza vaccination did not reduce all-cause mortality when compared to placebo (adjusted HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-1.05). Also, no differences between vaccination and placebo group were shown for underlying causes of death or seasonal mortality. In those aged 60-64, median survival increased with 20.1 months (95% CI 2.4-37.9), although no effects on all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72-1.03) could be demonstrated in survival analysis. In conclusion, this study did not demonstrate a statistically significant effect following single influenza vaccination on long-term mortality in community-dwelling elderly in general. We propose researchers designing future studies on influenza vaccination in the elderly to fit these studies for longer-term follow-up, and suggest age-group comparisons in observational research.

Premature life-threatening complications in Fabry patients arise from cardiovascular disease, including stroke and myocardial infarction. Exercise training has been shown to improve endothelial dysfunction in various settings including coronary artery disease. However, the effects of exercise training on endothelial dysfunction in Fabry disease have not been investigated. Gla knockout mice were single-housed in a cage equipped with a voluntary wheel (EX) or no wheel (SED) for 12 weeks. Exercised mice ran 10 km/day on average during the voluntary running intervention (VR) period. Despite significantly higher food intake in EX than SED, body weights of EX and SED remained stable during the VR period. After the completion of VR, citrate synthase activity in gastrocnemius muscle was significantly higher in EX than SED. VR resulted in greater phosphorylation of Akt (S473) and AMPK (T172) in the aorta of EX compared to SED measured by western blot. Furthermore, VR significantly enhanced eNOS protein expression and phosphorylation at S1177 by 20% and 50% in the aorta of EX when compared with SED. Similarly, plasma nitrate and nitrite levels were 77% higher in EX than SED. In contrast, measures of anti- and pro-oxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase and p67phox subunit of NADPH oxidase) and overall oxidative stress (plasma oxidized glutathione) were not different between groups. Although the aortic endothelial relaxation to acetylcholine was slightly increased in EX, it did not reach statistical significance. This study provides the first evidence that VR improves Akt/AMPK/eNOS signaling cascades, but not endothelial function in the aorta of aged Gla deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W2946182387,"Chinese consumers' craze about imported products, especially foods and drugs, peaked after various safety incidents, such as the contamination of Chinese dairy products. Recently, this boom has gradually receded because of the constant quality problems of imported products and the stricter safety supervision of domestic products. Researchers have measured consumer's perception toward domestic and imported products in various ways. In the current research, we investigated whether the country-of-origin stereotype has weakened in Chinese young consumers at the neurological level. By using a word-pair paradigm, 21 young participants were required to classify positive or negative words while event-related potentials were recorded. The results showed that reaction time to identify negative words following presentation of imported products (imported-negative condition) was longer than domestic products (domestic-negative condition). The amplitudes of N270 and LPP evoked in the imported-negative condition were significantly larger than those in the domestic-negative condition, possibly reflecting the higher expectation conflict when participate identified the adjectives as negative primed by imported healthy-related products. These findings revealed that young Chinese consumers still evaluated imported products better than domestic products."

While the kernel based methods can overcome these problems, a well-founded positive definite kernel based GS method has yet to be proposed for biomedical data analysis.Since the kernel based methods on genomic information can improve the prediction of diseases, here we proposed a noble method, ""kernel based gene shaving"" which is based on the influence function of kernel canonical correlation analysis. To investigate the performance of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art-method in gene saving, we analyzed extensive simulated and real microarray gene expression data set. The performance metrics including true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate, false negative rate, misclassification error rate, the false discovery rate and area under curves were computed for each methods. In colon cancer data analysis, the proposed method identified a significant subsets of 210 genes out of 2000 genes and suggestive superior performance compared with other methods. The proposed method can be applied to the study of other disease process where two view data is a common task.We addressed the challenge of finding unique kernel based GS methods by using the influence function of kernel canonical correlation analysis. The proposed method has shown to have better performance than state-of-the-art-methods in gene saving and has identified many more significant gene interactions, suggesting that genes function in a concerted effort in colon cancer. In similar biomedical data analysis, kernel based methods could be applied to select a potential subset of genes. The positive definite kernel based methods can overcome the non-linearity problem and improve the prediction process."
https://openalex.org/W2946353303,"Older adults have been found to focus more on positive and less on negative information compared to younger adults. Yet, results on this attentional positivity effect are inconsistent. Since personality has been related to attentional processing in younger adults, we explored whether (mal)adaptive personality traits are also linked to the occurrence of the positivity effect measured with eye tracking paradigms. We performed two studies with different experimental tasks and recruited for each study 60 community dwelling younger (aged 24–50) and 60 older (age 65–91) adults. We found some indication for a positivity effect with a free-viewing task (study 2), but not with a task measuring engagement and disengagement with emotional information (study 1). Although this effect should be interpreted with caution, it corroborates evidence that the positivity effect is more robust in situations without cognitive constraints. No evidence was found for personality traits to be related to the occurrence of the effect. Further research is needed to further clarify conditions that influence older adults’ attention for emotional information."

Therefore, understanding the mechanism underlying endosperm cell wall synthesis is important for determining the growth and quality of cereals. However, the molecular machinery mediating endosperm cell wall biosynthesis is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of Oryza sativa Brittle Culm 1-like 6 (OsBC1L6), a member of the COBRA-like protein family, in cellulose synthesis in rice. OsBC1L6 mRNA was expressed in ripening seeds during endosperm enlargement. When OsBC1L6-RFP was expressed in Arabidopsis cell cultures, this fusion protein was transported to the plasma membrane. To investigate the target molecules of OsBC1L6, we analyzed the binding interactions of OsBC1L6 with cellohexaose and the analogs using surface plasmon resonance, determining that cellohexaose bound to OsBC1L6. The β-glucan contents were significantly reduced in OsBC1L6-RNAi calli and OsBC1L6-deficient seeds from a Tos insertion mutant, compared to their wild-type counterparts. These findings suggest that OsBC1L6 modulates β-glucan synthesis during endosperm cell wall formation by interacting with cellulose moieties on the plasma membrane during seed ripening."
https://openalex.org/W2944840649,"This study investigated how the essential elements of informed consent are realised during the consent process and examined the challenges in obtaining genuine informed consent in Korea.Through purposive sampling, we recruited 21 subjects from those participating in anticancer drug research since 2013. We undertook 1:1 in-depth interviews and analysed the data by framework analysis.Themes raised throughout the interviews were categorised into 'disclosure' and 'understanding' of clinical information and 'decision'. Provider-centred information, both verbal and written, was delivered to each participant. There were few tools that the research staff might evaluate study participants' level of understanding of the provided information during the clinical trial. Although participants did not understand basic clinical trial concepts as much as desired, they may not seek to solve difficulties through communication with trial researchers. Doubts were raised about whether participants had sufficient capacity and free will to provide informed consent.There is a concern that informed consent can fall short of genuine in Korea. To ensure informed consent meets the international standard, greater efforts should be made to establish an explicit standard operational protocol for obtaining informed consent."
https://openalex.org/W2945948687,"Emerging evidences indicate that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but the mechanisms of HBV-induction lymphomagenesis remain unclear. In this report, retrospective analysis of the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) among NHL cases demonstrated significantly higher HBsAg carrier rate among B-cell NHL cases than controls (other cancers except primary liver cancer) (adjusted odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–2.16). Furthermore, cells with an immortalization potential existed in the peripheral blood of 4 patients with chronic HBV infection. Characterization of these cells showed their immunophenotypes similar to that of the majority of HBsAg-positive B-cell NHL patients. Immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements confirmed the clonal Ig gene rearrangements. Cytogenetic analysis revealed abnormal karyotypes of these cells with an immortalization potential. Compared with cells with an immortalization potential that we previously found in B-cell NHL patients by the same way, these cells showed many similar features. In conclusion, cells with an immortalization potential existed in the part of patients with chronic HBV infection before lymphoma development and showed some malignant features. They may be the cellular basis of HBV-associated lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2946225668,"A 26-GHz transmitter front-end is designed using 65 nm CMOS technology. The double frequency conversion transmitter consists of an intermediate frequency(IF) mixer, an millimeter-wave(mm-wave) mixer, and a pre-power amplifier. A double quadrature architecture is employed to accomplish image rejection without using an image rejection filter for the first time in the mm-wave frequency band. The IF mixer cores are designed as harmonic rejection mixers to avoid using IF filters. The measured conversion gain is 26.85±0.65 dB, with LO2 (IF LO) at 1-1.5 GHz and 26.9±0.6 dB with LO1 (mm-wave LO) at 27-29 GHz. The measured output return loss is less than -10 dB at 25.7-27.2 GHz. The output 1-dB compression point and the saturation output power measured at 26 GHz are 10 dBm and 14.1 dBm, respectively. The output-referred third-order intercept point (OIP3) measured at 26 GHz is 15.76 dBm. The third-order distortion, suppressed by the harmonic rejection mixer, is -60.5 dBc at an output power of 10 dBm. The error vector magnitude measured for OFDM 16-QAM with a 110-MHz signal bandwidth is -17.7 dB at an average output power of 3.5 dBm. The total power consumption of the proposed 26-GHz transmitter front-end is 267 mW, and it occupies a chip area of 2.31 mm2."
https://openalex.org/W2945427327,"Background Genome-wide association studies of common diseases or metabolite quantitative traits often identify common variants of small effect size, which may contribute to phenotypes by modulation of gene expression. Thus, there is growing demand for cellular models enabling to assess the impact of gene regulatory variants with moderate effects on gene expression. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is an important energy metabolism pathway. Common noncoding acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short chain (ACADS) gene variants are associated with plasma C4-acylcarnitine levels and allele-specific modulation of ACADS expression may contribute to the observed phenotype. Methods and findings We assessed ACADS expression and intracellular acylcarnitine levels in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) genotyped for a common ACADS variant associated with plasma C4-acylcarnitine and found a significant genotype-dependent decrease of ACADS mRNA and protein. Next, we modelled gradual decrease of ACADS expression using a tetracycline-regulated shRNA-knockdown of ACADS in Huh7 hepatocytes, a cell line with high fatty acid oxidation-(FAO)-capacity. Assessing acylcarnitine flux in both models, we found increased C4-acylcarnitine levels with decreased ACADS expression levels. Moreover, assessing time-dependent changes of acylcarnitine levels in shRNA-hepatocytes with altered ACADS expression levels revealed an unexpected effect on long- and medium-chain fatty acid intermediates. Conclusions Both, genotyped LCL and regulated shRNA-knockdown are valuable tools to model moderate, gradual gene-regulatory effects of common variants on cellular phenotypes. Decreasing ACADS expression levels modulate short and surprisingly also long/medium chain acylcarnitines, and may contribute to increased plasma acylcarnitine levels."
