https://openalex.org/W1990455089,"Most of our knowledge of the structures of free molecules comes from indirect observations that focus on other properties (for example, energy or mass spectra) that depend on structure. Recently, a new method has been developed that instead yields geometrical images of individual molecules. This method takes advantage of the large Coulomb repulsion of the nuclei within molecules rapidly stripped of their electrons. The first experiments with this new technique have already revealed structural images of several important species, such as positively charged methane ions."

An infrared band at 3.915 (+/- 0.015) micrometers in several ground-based spectra of Io can be accounted for by reflectance from H(2)S frost deposited on or cocondensed with sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) frost. Temporal variation in the occurrence and intensity of the band suggests that condensed H(2)S on Io's surface is transient, implying a similar variation of H(2)S abundance in Io's atmosphere. The band was observed in full-disk measurements of Io at several orbital longitudes, including once at 24 degrees ( approximately 0.5 hour after Io's reappearance after an eclipse)-but not after another reappearance at 22 degrees -and once at 95 degrees (on Io's leading hemisphere). These results suggest that condensed H(2)S is sparse and variable but can be widespread on Io's surface. When present, it would not only produce the infrared band but would brighten Io's typical surface at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths."

https://openalex.org/W1970311038,Transient events observed since 1980 by the Gamma-Ray Spectrometer experiment on the Solar Maximum Mission satellite (SMM) have been identified with radiation emitted from 18 different Soviet nuclear reactor-powered satellites. Most of these satellites are similar to Cosmos 954 and 1402 which reentered the atmosphere. Gamma radiation from these satellites was detected when they passed within about 400 to 500 kilometers of SMM. Positron annihilation line radiation (511 kiloelectron volts) and charged-particle events were detected when SMM encountered clouds of positrons and electrons emitted by these satellites and stored up to tens of minutes in the geomagnetic field. The rate of these events varied from about 1 in 5 days to over 30 per day and was strongly dependent on the operating altitudes of the Cosmos satellites and density of the upper atmosphere.
https://openalex.org/W1999134838,"Since launch in early 1980 the Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) onboard the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) satellite has monitored the sun at gamma-ray energies. In addition to observations of solar flares, cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and precipitating radiation belt electrons, the instrument has detected a new class of high-energy transient events that cannot be attributed to any of these phenomena. The duration of these transients can range from 1 second to more than 10 minutes. The average event rate between 1980 and 1986 was about five per month. However, in February 1987 this rate increased by more than a factor of 25 and continued at this high level until June 1988. These transients can be subdivided into three classes: (i) 0.511-megaelectron volt annihilation line events, (ii) particle events, and (iii) broad-band photon continuum-like events. Evidence is presented that these transients are not of natural origin. It is found that the most likely sources of these events are reactors in earth orbiting satellites. Apart from the threat these reactors pose upon accidental reentry, the reactor-generated transients may have a deleterious effect on cosmic observations obtained with gamma-ray detectors in low earth orbit."
https://openalex.org/W1986912842,"The Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) Gamma-Ray Spectrometer has on many occasions detected nuclear radiation produced by nuclear reactors carried on Soviet satellites. A unique feature of the observations is the measurement of bursts of 511-kiloelectron volt gamma rays that are thought to signal SMM encounters with positrons emanating from the Soviet satellites. A model of positron generation by an orbiting reactor has been developed that describes the resulting time-dependent distribution of positrons temporarily trapped in the geomagnetic field and estimates the response of the SMM spectrometer to passage through such distributions. The model successfully predicts onset times, durations, and intensities of the 511-kiloelectron volt gamma bursts, as we illustrate in a detailed analysis of one event, and thus confirms that these are due to positrons from the Soviet satellites. Reactor-generated positrons are potentially useful in magnetospheric research."

https://openalex.org/W2081902225,"Gamma rays at energies of 0.3 to 8 megaelectron volts (MeV) were detected on 15 April 1988 from four nuclear-powered satellites including Cosmos 1900 and Cosmos 1932 as they flew over a double Compton gamma-ray telescope. The observations occurred as the telescope, flown from a balloon at an altitude of 35 kilometers from Alice Springs, Australia, searched for celestial gamma-ray sources. The four transient signals were detected in 30 hours of data. Their time profiles show maxima with durations of (21 ± 1) and (27 ± 1) seconds (half-width at half maximum) for the lower two satellites and (85 ± 5) and (113 ± 7) seconds for the remaining two. Their durations place the origin of the two shorter signals at orbital radii of 260+40-60 and 260 ± 60 km above the earth and the two longer at 800+100-300 and 800+250-300 kilometers. Their luminosities for energies >0.3 MeV are then (6.1 ± 1.5) × 1015, (3.9 ± 1.0) × 1015, (1.10 ± 0.28) × 1016, and (1.30 ± 0.32) × 1016 photons per second. The imaging of the strongest signal indicates a southeastern direction passing nearly overhead. The energy spectrum can be fit to an exponential with index 2.4 ± 1.4. These transient events add to the already large backgrounds for celestial gamma ray sources."

https://openalex.org/W2039546903,"In bringing to a conclusion these few scattered reflections concerning valence variation and atomic structure, may I be permitted to say this: He who is experimentally inclined may henceforth take heart and he need not be quite so timid in interpreting strange chemical reactions on the assumption of possible anomaly in the valence of the reactants. The physicist has no hesitation in speaking of the temporary existence, at the higher temperature employed in spectroscopic work, of such molecules as BaCl, AlO, (HO), CH(+), CH(2), MgF, etc. Is it not possible that under the influence of surface forces somewhat similar valence variation may not be excluded even at lower temperatures? That these strange compounds are thermodynamically unstable may be true. Nevertheless, they may function as the mysterious catalysts, or as initiators of chain reactions."
