https://openalex.org/W2155680682,"A systematic analysis of metabolites in prostate cancer samples has led to the discovery that sarcosine, an amino acid common in many biological tissues including muscle, is highly elevated in aggressive prostate cancers and detectable in the urine of men with prostate cancer. This makes sarcosine a candidate biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis. Targeted knockdown of the enzyme that generates sarcosine from glycine attenuated prostate cell invasion in mice, pointing to a possible role in metastasis, and adding the sarcosine pathway to the list of possible therapeutic targets. A systematic analysis of metabolites in prostate cancer samples has led to the identification of sarcosine as a putative biomarker detectable in urine, which could potentially be used to aid prostate cancer diagnosis. Sarcosine promotes the invasion of prostate cancer cells and may play a role in metastasis. Multiple, complex molecular events characterize cancer development and progression1,2. Deciphering the molecular networks that distinguish organ-confined disease from metastatic disease may lead to the identification of critical biomarkers for cancer invasion and disease aggressiveness. Although gene and protein expression have been extensively profiled in human tumours, little is known about the global metabolomic alterations that characterize neoplastic progression. Using a combination of high-throughput liquid-and-gas-chromatography-based mass spectrometry, we profiled more than 1,126 metabolites across 262 clinical samples related to prostate cancer (42 tissues and 110 each of urine and plasma). These unbiased metabolomic profiles were able to distinguish benign prostate, clinically localized prostate cancer and metastatic disease. Sarcosine, an N-methyl derivative of the amino acid glycine, was identified as a differential metabolite that was highly increased during prostate cancer progression to metastasis and can be detected non-invasively in urine. Sarcosine levels were also increased in invasive prostate cancer cell lines relative to benign prostate epithelial cells. Knockdown of glycine-N-methyl transferase, the enzyme that generates sarcosine from glycine, attenuated prostate cancer invasion. Addition of exogenous sarcosine or knockdown of the enzyme that leads to sarcosine degradation, sarcosine dehydrogenase, induced an invasive phenotype in benign prostate epithelial cells. Androgen receptor and the ERG gene fusion product coordinately regulate components of the sarcosine pathway. Here, by profiling the metabolomic alterations of prostate cancer progression, we reveal sarcosine as a potentially important metabolic intermediary of cancer cell invasion and aggressivity."
https://openalex.org/W2151754128,"A major yet unresolved quest in decoding the human genome is the identification of the regulatory sequences that control the spatial and temporal expression of genes. Distant-acting transcriptional enhancers are particularly challenging to uncover because they are scattered among the vast non-coding portion of the genome. Evolutionary sequence constraint can facilitate the discovery of enhancers, but fails to predict when and where they are active in vivo. Here we present the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation with the enhancer-associated protein p300 followed by massively parallel sequencing, and map several thousand in vivo binding sites of p300 in mouse embryonic forebrain, midbrain and limb tissue. We tested 86 of these sequences in a transgenic mouse assay, which in nearly all cases demonstrated reproducible enhancer activity in the tissues that were predicted by p300 binding. Our results indicate that in vivo mapping of p300 binding is a highly accurate means for identifying enhancers and their associated activities, and suggest that such data sets will be useful to study the role of tissue-specific enhancers in human biology and disease on a genome-wide scale. Determining the spatial and temporal activity patterns of enhancers, short DNA segments that can bind to regulatory proteins to enhance gene transcription levels, remains a challenge in the functional annotation of the human genome. The in vivo application of ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel sequencing) has been used to map genome-wide occupancy of the enhancer-associated protein p300 in developing mouse tissues. There are several thousand p300 binding sites in the embryonic forebrain, midbrain and limb tissues, and testing a sample of these suggests that most are associated with reproducible enhancer activity. Data sets of this type will be useful in the study of the role of enhancers in human biology and in pathological processes. Determining the spatial and temporal activity patterns of enhancers remains a challenge in the functional annotation of the human genome. In this study, the genome-wide occupancy of the enhancer-associated protein p300 was determined in developing mouse tissues by using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing. Testing the p300-bound sequences in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay confirmed that p300 binding is a highly effective means to identify enhancers and to predict in which tissues they are active."
https://openalex.org/W2170392103,"Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is one of the best studied model organisms, and has been associated with human activity for thousands of years. Two papers published in the 19 March 2009 issue of Nature provide a picture of its population structure and its relationship with other yeasts. Liti et al. compare genome variation in S. cerevisiae isolates with its closest wild cousin, S. paradoxus, which has never been associated with human activity. They find that variation in S. paradoxus closely follows geographic borders; S. cerevisiae shows less differentiation, consistent with opportunities for cross-breeding, rather than a few distinct domestication events, as the main human influence. Schacherer et al. compare 63 S. cerevisiae isolates from different ecological niches and geographic locations. They find evidence for genetic differentiation of three distinct subgroups based on where the strains were isolated: from vineyards, sake and related fermentations and lab strains. Their data support the hypothesis that these three groups represent separate domestication events, and that S. cerevisiae as a whole is not domesticated. By sequencing over seventy isolates of the domesticated baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its closest relative, S. paradoxus, this study describes variation in gene content, SNPs, indels, copy numbers and transposable elements, providing insights into the evolution of different lineages, phenotypic variation, domestication and population structure of Saccharomyces. Since the completion of the genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1996 (refs 1, 2), there has been a large increase in complete genome sequences, accompanied by great advances in our understanding of genome evolution. Although little is known about the natural and life histories of yeasts in the wild, there are an increasing number of studies looking at ecological and geographic distributions3,4, population structure5,6,7,8 and sexual versus asexual reproduction9,10. Less well understood at the whole genome level are the evolutionary processes acting within populations and species that lead to adaptation to different environments, phenotypic differences and reproductive isolation. Here we present one- to fourfold or more coverage of the genome sequences of over seventy isolates of the baker’s yeast S. cerevisiae and its closest relative, Saccharomyces paradoxus. We examine variation in gene content, single nucleotide polymorphisms, nucleotide insertions and deletions, copy numbers and transposable elements. We find that phenotypic variation broadly correlates with global genome-wide phylogenetic relationships. S. paradoxus populations are well delineated along geographic boundaries, whereas the variation among worldwide S. cerevisiae isolates shows less differentiation and is comparable to a single S. paradoxus population. Rather than one or two domestication events leading to the extant baker’s yeasts, the population structure of S. cerevisiae consists of a few well-defined, geographically isolated lineages and many different mosaics of these lineages, supporting the idea that human influence provided the opportunity for cross-breeding and production of new combinations of pre-existing variations."

https://openalex.org/W2163837156,"Omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3-PUFAs) have well-documented protective effects that are attributed not only to eicosanoid inhibition but also to the formation of novel biologically active lipid mediators (i.e., resolvins and protectins). In this study, we examined their effects on ob/ob mice, an obesity model of insulin resistance and fatty liver disease. Dietary intake of omega-3-PUFAs had insulin-sensitizing actions in adipose tissue and liver and improved insulin tolerance in obese mice. Genes involved in insulin sensitivity (PPARgamma), glucose transport (GLUT-2/GLUT-4), and insulin receptor signaling (IRS-1/IRS-2) were up-regulated by omega-3-PUFAs. Moreover, omega-3-PUFAs increased adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing adipokine, and induced AMPK phosphorylation, a fuel-sensing enzyme and a gatekeeper of the energy balance. Concomitantly, hepatic steatosis was alleviated by omega-3-PUFAs. A lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry revealed that omega-3-PUFAs inhibited the formation of omega-6-PUFA-derived eicosanoids, while triggering the formation of omega-3-PUFA-derived resolvins and protectins. Moreover, representative members of these lipid mediators, namely resolvin E1 and protectin D1, mimicked the insulin-sensitizing and antisteatotic effects of omega-3-PUFAs and induced adiponectin expression to a similar extent that of rosiglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione family of antidiabetic drugs. Taken together, these findings uncover beneficial actions of omega-3-PUFAs and their bioactive lipid autacoids in preventing obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis."
https://openalex.org/W2039316942,"Comprehensive identification of polymorphisms among individuals within a species is essential both for studying the genetic basis of phenotypic differences and for elucidating the evolutionary history of the species. Large-scale polymorphism surveys have recently been reported for human, mouse and Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we report a nucleotide-level survey of genomic variation in a diverse collection of 63 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains sampled from different ecological niches (beer, bread, vineyards, immunocompromised individuals, various fermentations and nature) and from locations on different continents. We hybridized genomic DNA from each strain to whole-genome tiling microarrays and detected 1.89 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, which were grouped into 101,343 distinct segregating sites. We also identified 3,985 deletion events of length >200 base pairs among the surveyed strains. We analysed the genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism and deletion variants, and measured the extent of linkage disequilibrium in S. cerevisiae. These results and the polymorphism resource we have generated lay the foundation for genome-wide association studies in yeast. We also examined the population structure of S. cerevisiae, providing support for multiple domestication events as well as insight into the origins of pathogenic strains."
https://openalex.org/W2016024994,"Epigenetic mechanisms that maintain neurogenesis throughout adult life remain poorly understood. Trithorax group (trxG) and Polycomb group (PcG) gene products are part of an evolutionarily conserved chromatin remodelling system that activate or silence gene expression, respectively. Although PcG member Bmi1 has been shown to be required for postnatal neural stem cell self-renewal, the role of trxG genes remains unknown. Here we show that the trxG member Mll1 (mixed-lineage leukaemia 1) is required for neurogenesis in the mouse postnatal brain. Mll1-deficient subventricular zone neural stem cells survive, proliferate and efficiently differentiate into glial lineages; however, neuronal differentiation is severely impaired. In Mll1-deficient cells, early proneural Mash1 (also known as Ascl1) and gliogenic Olig2 expression are preserved, but Dlx2, a key downstream regulator of subventricular zone neurogenesis, is not expressed. Overexpression of Dlx2 can rescue neurogenesis in Mll1-deficient cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that Dlx2 is a direct target of MLL in subventricular zone cells. In differentiating wild-type subventricular zone cells, Mash1, Olig2 and Dlx2 loci have high levels of histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), consistent with their transcription. In contrast, in Mll1-deficient subventricular zone cells, chromatin at Dlx2 is bivalently marked by both H3K4me3 and histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and the Dlx2 gene fails to properly activate. These data support a model in which Mll1 is required to resolve key silenced bivalent loci in postnatal neural precursors to the actively transcribed state for the induction of neurogenesis, but not for gliogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964663565,"T-cell activation requires the influx of extracellular calcium, although mechanistic details regarding such activation are not fully defined. Here, we show that P2X(7) receptors play a key role in calcium influx and downstream signaling events associated with the activation of T cells. By real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, we find that Jurkat T cells and human CD4(+) T cells express abundant P2X(7) receptors. We show, using a novel fluorescent microscopy technique, that T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation triggers the rapid release of ATP (<100 microM). This release of ATP is required for TCR-mediated calcium influx, NFAT activation, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. TCR activation up-regulates P2X(7) receptor gene expression. Removal of extracellular ATP by apyrase or alkaline phosphatase treatment, inhibition of ATP release with the maxi-anion channel blocker gadolinium chloride, or siRNA silencing of P2X(7) receptors blocks calcium entry and inhibits T-cell activation. Moreover, lymphocyte activation is impaired in C57BL/6 mice that express poorly functional P2X(7) receptors, compared to control BALB/c mice, which express fully functional P2X(7) receptors. We conclude that ATP release and autocrine, positive feedback through P2X(7) receptors is required for the effective activation of T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2013976859,"With four primate genome sequences now available — macaque, orang-utan, chimpanzee and human — it has become possible to construct a comparative segmental duplication map of four primate genomes. This has now been done, and the resulting map used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of all human segmental duplications. The ancestral branch leading to humans and the African great apes shows a fourfold acceleration of segmental duplication accumulation at a time when other mutational processes such as single-base-pair mutation were slowing. This apparent burst of activity may be the result of a change in the effective population size or generation time, or imply a period of genomic destabilization. A comparative segmental duplication map of four primate genomes that allows the evolutionary history of all human segmental duplications to be reconstructed is presented. It reveals a fourfold acceleration of segmental duplication accumulation during the speciation of human, chimpanzee and gorilla at a time when other mutational processes were slowing, and also provides a detailed evolutionary history of all human segmental duplications as a resource to the human genetics community. It is generally accepted that the extent of phenotypic change between human and great apes is dissonant with the rate of molecular change1. Between these two groups, proteins are virtually identical1,2, cytogenetically there are few rearrangements that distinguish ape–human chromosomes3, and rates of single-base-pair change4,5,6,7 and retrotransposon activity8,9,10 have slowed particularly within hominid lineages when compared to rodents or monkeys. Studies of gene family evolution indicate that gene loss and gain are enriched within the primate lineage11,12. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of duplication content of four primate genomes (macaque, orang-utan, chimpanzee and human) in an effort to understand the pattern and rates of genomic duplication during hominid evolution. We find that the ancestral branch leading to human and African great apes shows the most significant increase in duplication activity both in terms of base pairs and in terms of events. This duplication acceleration within the ancestral species is significant when compared to lineage-specific rate estimates even after accounting for copy-number polymorphism and homoplasy. We discover striking examples of recurrent and independent gene-containing duplications within the gorilla and chimpanzee that are absent in the human lineage. Our results suggest that the evolutionary properties of copy-number mutation differ significantly from other forms of genetic mutation and, in contrast to the hominid slowdown of single-base-pair mutations, there has been a genomic burst of duplication activity at this period during human evolution."

https://openalex.org/W1966759986,"Intracellular pattern recognition receptors MDA5, RIG-I, and LGP2 are essential components of the cellular response to virus infection and are homologous to the DEXH box subfamily of RNA helicases. However, the relevance of helicase activity in the regulation of interferon production remains elusive. To examine the importance of the helicase domain function for these signaling proteins, a series of mutations targeting conserved helicase sequence motifs were analyzed for enzymatic activity, RNA binding, interferon induction, and antiviral signaling. Results indicate that all targeted motifs are required for ATP hydrolysis, but a subset is involved in RNA binding. The enzymatically inactive mutants differed in their signaling ability. Notably, mutations to MDA5 motifs I, III, and VI and RIG-I motif III produced helicase proteins with constitutive antiviral activity, whereas mutations in RIG-I motif V retained ATP hydrolysis but failed to mediate signal transduction. These findings demonstrate that type I interferon production mediated by full-length MDA5 and RIG-I is independent of the helicase domain catalytic activity. In addition, neither enzymatic activity nor RNA binding was required for negative regulation of antiviral signaling by LGP2, supporting an RNA-independent interference mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1976066269,"The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) plays pivotal roles in physiology and pathophysiology. Constitutive or hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha overexpression is observed in many types of cancers including prostate adenocarcinoma, in which it is associated with resistance to apoptosis and therapeutic agents. BCL-xL, a hypoxia-responsive, anti-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, is also overexpressed in prostate carcinoma and many other cancers. Despite this connection, whether BCL-xL expression is directly regulated by HIF-1alpha is not known. We used prostate cancer PC-3 cell with constitutive high HIF-1alpha level as a model to address this important question. We first generated prostate cancer PC-3 cells in which HIF-1alpha was stably knocked-down (HIF-KD) by using small interference RNA. BCL-xL was dramatically decreased in HIF-KD PC-3 cells, in parallel with sensitization to apoptosis with caspase-3 activation as well as decreased cell proliferation. We then demonstrated that HIF-1alpha directly regulated BCL-xL transcription by binding to a hypoxia-responsive element in the BCL-xL promoter (-865 to -847) by reporter gene assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays. HIF-1alpha-dependent BCL-xL overexpression may be an important mechanism by which HIF-1alpha protects prostate cancer cells from apoptosis and leads to treatment resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2045488700,"Cilengitide is a high-affinity cyclic pentapeptdic alphaV integrin antagonist previously reported to suppress angiogenesis by inducing anoikis of endothelial cells adhering through alphaVbeta3/alphaVbeta5 integrins. Angiogenic endothelial cells express multiple integrins, in particular those of the beta1 family, and little is known on the effect of cilengitide on endothelial cells expressing alphaVbeta3 but adhering through beta1 integrins. Through morphological, biochemical, pharmacological and functional approaches we investigated the effect of cilengitide on alphaVbeta3-expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured on the beta1 ligands fibronectin and collagen I. We show that cilengitide activated cell surface alphaVbeta3, stimulated phosphorylation of FAK (Y(397) and Y(576/577)), Src (S(418)) and VE-cadherin (Y(658) and Y(731)), redistributed alphaVbeta3 at the cell periphery, caused disappearance of VE-cadherin from cellular junctions, increased the permeability of HUVEC monolayers and detached HUVEC adhering on low-density beta1 integrin ligands. Pharmacological inhibition of Src kinase activity fully prevented cilengitide-induced phosphorylation of Src, FAK and VE-cadherin, and redistribution of alphaVbeta3 and VE-cadherin and partially prevented increased permeability, but did not prevent HUVEC detachment from low-density matrices. Taken together, these observations reveal a previously unreported effect of cilengitide on endothelial cells namely its ability to elicit signaling events disrupting VE-cadherin localization at cellular contacts and to increase endothelial monolayer permeability. These effects are potentially relevant to the clinical use of cilengitide as anticancer agent."

The genetic engineering of EPSPS led to the introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops worldwide. The genetically engineered corn lines NK603 and GA21 carry distinct EPSPS enzymes.

The crystal structure at 1.7-Å resolution revealed that the dual mutation causes a shift of residue Gly96 toward the glyphosate binding site, impairing efficient binding of glyphosate, while the side chain of Ile97 points away from the substrate binding site, facilitating PEP utilization. The single site T97I mutation renders the enzyme sensitive to glyphosate and causes a substantial decrease in the affinity for PEP.

Multisite mutations with more favorable properties were sought and discovered, including Petunia hybrida EPSPS mutants G101A/G137D and G101A/P158S (19Padgette S.R. Re D.B. Barry G.F. Eichholtz D.E.

The T102I/P106S double mutant EPSPS (corresponding to T97I/P101S in E. coli; abbreviated as TIPS EPSPS) had particularly favorable characteristics. The TIPS mutations were introduced into the endogenous EPSPS enzyme of Z. mays (field corn, GA21 event) to produce the first commercial varieties of glyphosate-resistant maize. The Class II EPSPS from Agrobacterium sp. strain CP4 was eventually utilized to create transgenic glyphosate-resistant crops (NK603 corn event). The distinct properties of the CP4 EPSPS have been recently elucidated (15Funke T. Han H. Healy-Fried M.L. Fischer M. Schonbrunn E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13010-13015Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For the TIPS enzyme, however, the structural basis of glyphosate resistance was unknown. Here, we utilized EPSPS from E. coli as a model of the plant enzyme to investigate the kinetic and structural properties of the single-site T97I and the double-site TIPS mutant enzymes. The implications for glyphosate resistance with respect to genetic engineering and the likelihood of spontaneous mutations are discussed. Chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. S3P was synthesized and purified as described previously (18Priestman M.A. Funke T. Singh I.M. Crupper S.S. Schonbrunn E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The pET-24d vector (Novagen) containing the open reading frame of EPSPS from E. coli was used as a template for the mutations. Single-site T97I mutations were introduced in the wild-type EPSPS and in the P101S mutant EPSPS using the QuikChange II mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate primers (MWG Biotech). The single mutant T97I and double mutant TIPS EPSPS enzymes were overexpressed in BL21(DE3)-competent cells (Novagen) and purified as previously described (22Eschenburg S. Healy M.L. Priestman M.A. Lushington G.H. Schonbrunn E. Planta. 2002; 216: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After the final purification step, the enzymes were concentrated in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA using Centricon-30 devices (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using Coomassie reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Enzyme Kinetics-The enzymatic activities of WT, P101S, T97I, and TIPS EPSPS were measured by determining the amount of inorganic phosphate produced in the forward reaction with S3P and PEP as substrates in 96-well plates on a Spectra-Max 340PC plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Each 60-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and S3P, PEP, and glyphosate concentrations as indicated. The reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme and were stopped by addition of the ammonium molybdate-malachite green reagent (32Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Analyt. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Change in absorbance at 650 nm was measured, and product formation was determined by comparison to inorganic phosphate standards. Enzymatic activity is expressed as micromoles of phosphate produced per minute of reaction per milligram of enzyme (units/mg). The Km and Vmax values were determined by fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The Ki values were determined by fitting data to Equation 1, Km(obs)=KmKi*[I]+KmEq. 1 where Km(obs) is the Michaelis constant for PEP in the presence of glyphosate, [I] is the glyphosate concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant for PEP in the absence of glyphosate. The IC50 values for EPSPS inhibition were determined by fitting data to Equation 2, A=11+([I]/IC50)nEq. 2 where A is the relative activity remaining in the presence of glyphosate, [I] is the concentration of glyphosate, and n is the Hill slope. Crystallography-The T97I and TIPS mutant EPSPS were crystallized at 19 °C by the hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method in the presence of 5 mm S3P, with or without 5 mm glyphosate, using the sodium formate crystallization conditions described previously (22Eschenburg S. Healy M.L. Priestman M.A. Lushington G.H. Schonbrunn E. Planta. 2002; 216: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The protein concentration in each case was 37.5 mg/ml, or 810 μm, maintaining a ligand-to-receptor molar ratio of ∼6:1. X-ray diffraction data were recorded at –180 °C using the rotation method on single flash-frozen crystals (detector: Rigaku HTC image plate; X-rays: CuKα, focused by mirror optics; Generator: Rigaku Micro-Max 007-HF (MSC, The Woodlands, TX)). The data were reduced with XDS (33Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). The program package CNS (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Open table in a new tab Amino acids 90–104 are strictly conserved in class I EPSPS from bacteria and plants (supplemental Table S1). We introduced the double mutation T97I/P101S (TIPS), the basis for glyphosate-resistant GA21 corn, and the single mutation T97I into E. coli EPSPS and studied the mutant enzymes by steady-state kinetics and crystallography. Enzyme Kinetics-The TIPS and T97I mutant enzymes were found to be catalytically active, and the enzymatic reactions displayed normal saturation kinetics. The kinetic constants of the wild-type (WT) and the P101S enzymes (12Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Shuttleworth W.A. Schloss J.V. Amrhein N. Evans J.N. Kabsch W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 32949-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were re-determined in parallel to facilitate accurate comparisons. The WT EPSPS was the most active enzyme, with Vmax values of ∼57 units/mg and kcat/Km values of close to 106 m–1 s–1 for both substrates (Table 2 and supplemental Figs. S1–S6). The activity of the single-site mutant enzymes T97I and P101S were decreased 5- and 2.5-fold, respectively, and the activity of TIPS EPSPS was decreased nearly 9-fold. The substrate binding affinities, as reflected by the respective Km values, was only slightly decreased for the P101S and TIPS enzymes, but the T97I mutant showed nearly 9-fold increase in Km for PEP. Compared with the WT enzyme, the catalytic efficiencies with respect to PEP utilization were decreased 40- and 16-fold for the T97I and TIPS enzymes, respectively. Unlike WT EPSPS, which is very sensitive to glyphosate (Ki = 0.3 μm), the TIPS enzyme tolerates high glyphosate concentrations (Ki = 2.4 mm) (Fig. 2). By contrast, the P101S and T97I enzymes are still inhibited by moderate concentrations of glyphosate, with Ki values of 3 and 90 μm, respectively. Apparently, neither single-site mutation, T97I or P101S, is sufficient to enable glyphosate resistance and maintain high affinity for the substrate PEP. Only the simultaneous mutation of both residues renders the enzyme both insensitive to glyphosate and catalytically efficient.TABLE 2Kinetic characteristics of mutant and wild-type EPSPSEPSPSKm (PEP)Km (S3P)Vmaxkcat/Km (PEP)kcat/Km (S3P)IC50Kiμmμmunits/mgm-1s-1m-1s-1μmμmWT45 ± 548 ± 557 ± 19.3 × 1059.1 × 1051.6 ± 0.030.3 ± 0.07P101S71 ± 771 ± 623 ± 0.52.5 × 1052.4 × 10512 ± 0.53.0 ± 0.3T97I380 ± 2177 ± 312 ± 0.12.3 × 1041.2 × 105330 ± 1090 ± 6TIPS100 ± 671 ± 67 ± 0.25.7 × 1047.4 × 1046600 ± 1902420 ± 87 Open table in a new tab We next asked if analogs of the tetrahedral reaction intermediates, the most potent inhibitors of WT EPSPS described to date (40Alberg D.G.

The TIPS and WT enzymes showed nearly equal sensitivity to the inhibitors tested (supplemental Fig. S7). These findings support the hypothesis that inhibitors with more global coverage of the active site are not as affected by mutations that cause resistance to glyphosate (42Funke T. Healy-Fried M.L. Han H. Alberg D.G. Bartlett P.A. Schonbrunn E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13344-13351Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Protein Crystallography-To better understand the effect of the mutations on the catalytic efficiency and inhibition by glyphosate, the T97I and TIPS enzymes were co-crystallized with S3P alone and in complex with S3P and glyphosate; the resulting 1.7-Å resolution structures (Table 1) were compared with those of the WT (12Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Shuttleworth W.A. Schloss J.V. Amrhein N. Evans J.N. Kabsch W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 32949-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) enzymes. Thr97 and Pro101 are constituents of an α-helix in the N-terminal globular domain of EPSPS (Fig. 3). Neither of these two residues is directly involved in glyphosate binding. Pro101 is ∼9Å distant from glyphosate and the hydroxyl group of Thr97 interacts with the phosphonate moiety of glyphosate only through a bridging water molecule. The altered amino acids are well defined in the respective electron density maps (Fig. 4). Glyphosate is bound in the same site and conformation as observed in the WT enzyme; however, potential steric clashes with the Cα atom of Gly96 occur in both mutant enzymes (Fig. 5). This leads to additional unfavorable interactions between the glyphosate molecule and other active site residues, particularly in the TIPS enzyme. The reduced binding potential of glyphosate in the respective mutant enzymes is reflected by an increase in the crystallographic B-factors (higher B-factor values reflect higher flexibility) (Fig. 6). Notably, the B-factors of S3P are only slightly increased for both mutant enzymes (supplemental Fig. S8). Thus, the crystallographic data seem to reveal the structural basis for the kinetic properties of these enzymes.FIGURE 5The glyphosate binding sites of T97I and TIPS EPSPS (stereo views). Top: glyphosate (shown in green) bound to T97I EPSPS reveals potential steric clashes with the Cα atom of Gly96 (d = 3.13 Å) and with the side chain of Glu341 (d = 2.93 Å) (red dotted lines). Bottom: in TIPS EPSPS these clashes are more pronounced (Gly96: d = 3.02 Å; Glu341: d = 2.82 Å) and additional unfavorable interactions occur between glyphosate and S3P (d = 3.02 Å) and the Cδ atom of Arg386 (d = 3.11 Å). S3P is shown in yellow. The helix harboring residues 97–101 is indicated in orange. Black dotted lines indicate polar interactions. The cyan spheres denote water molecules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Impact of the mutations on the glyphosate molecule. For WT EPSPS, the average B-factor of glyphosate (•; 7.7 Å2) is smaller than the average main-chain B-factor (10.0 Å2), reflecting the tight binding of the inhibitor. When bound to the T97I (▴) or the TIPS (▪) enzyme the B-factors are substantially increased, indicating the weaker binding potential as a result of these mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The overall structures of the T97I and TIPS enzymes are nearly identical to that of WT EPSPS; however, large root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) differences, up to 1 Å for the TIPS enzyme, occur in the main chain around residues 96–98 (Fig. 7). In the WT and P101S enzymes, the hydroxyl group of Thr97 is hydrogen-bonded with the side chain of Asn26 (Fig. 8). Upon mutation to isoleucine, the disruption of this polar interaction and the resulting repulsive forces between the Ile97 and Asn26 side chains impose changes in the backbone torsion angles of residues 96–98 (supplemental Table S2). In the T97I enzyme, the presence of the Pro101 ring holds the carbonyl oxygen of Ile97 in place, thereby constraining its rotational freedom. In the TIPS enzyme, in contrast, the additional Ser101 substitution allows the main chain of Ile97 to relax and the Ile97 side chain to move away from the glyphosate/PEP site. As a result, Gly96 is rearranged such that its Cα atom shifts toward the glyphosate binding site, thereby shortening the distance to the inhibitor’s phosphonate moiety and effectively narrowing the binding site.FIGURE 8Mutation-induced structural changes in EPSPS (stereo views). Top: EPSPS in complex with S3P. In the WT enzyme binary complex (shown in orange) Thr97 is in hydrogen bonding distance (2.8 Å) to the amide side chain of Asn96. In the T97I enzyme binary complex (maroon) the presence of the Pro101 ring holds Ile97 in place, and its side chain moves only slightly. In the TIPS enzyme binary complex (cyan) Ser101 allows larger conformational freedom for Ile97, and the isoleucine side chain swings away from Asn26. Bottom: EPSPS in complex with S3P and glyphosate bound. In the ternary complex, the mutations cause a shift of the Cα atom of Gly96 toward the phosphonate moiety of glyphosate, seen most drastically in the TIPS enzyme (cyan), thereby narrowing the inhibitor binding site. The view is ∼90° clockwise from the top.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because glyphosate and PEP share the same binding site, one would expect intuitively that the TIPS enzyme to be less efficient in the utilization of PEP, yet only the single mutation drastically reduces the affinity for PEP. Because we cannot obtain the true ternary complexes with S3P and PEP bound to the EPSPS active site, we determined the respective EPSPS·S3P binary complexes to which PEP would bind during catalysis (Fig. 8). Even in the absence of glyphosate, the geometric constraints in the T97I enzyme lock the Ile97 side chain in close distance to the putative PEP site, likely to exert repulsive forces on the charged, polar PEP molecule during binding and/or catalysis. By contrast, Ile97 in the TIPS binary complex rotates even further away from the PEP site than in the ternary complex with glyphosate bound. Overall, it appears that the mutation-induced shifts of Gly96 predominantly impact the inhibitory potential of glyphosate, whereas the conformation of Ile97 influences the catalytic efficiency of the EPSPS enzyme. The TIPS EPSPS enzyme shows high levels of glyphosate resistance while maintaining high affinity for its substrates, PEP and S3P. The single-site T97I enzyme is less sensitive to inhibition by glyphosate; moreover, in the absence of the compensating P101S mutation, it exhibits drastically decreased affinity for PEP. These phenomena can be attributed to specific structural changes in the active site. The glyphosate resistance exhibited by the TIPS enzyme is on the same order of magnitude as that observed for the class II EPSPS enzymes from S. aureus and CP4 EPSPS (15Funke T. Han H. Healy-Fried M.L. Fischer M. Schonbrunn E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13010-13015Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 18Priestman M.A. Funke T. Singh I.M. Crupper S.S. Schonbrunn E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To date, TIPS EPSPS represents the only Class I enzyme with both high glyphosate resistance and unaltered affinity for PEP. The only other highly glyphosate-resistant class I mutant enzyme is G96A EPSPS from E. coli and K. pneumoniae, but this mutation causes a very large decrease in affinity for PEP (Km = 2.8 mm (22Eschenburg S. Healy M.L. Priestman M.A. Lushington G.H. Schonbrunn E. Planta. 2002; 216: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). Mutations of the residue corresponding to Pro101 of E. coli EPSPS have been reported in a number of field-evolved glyphosate-resistant weeds (43Yu Q. Cairns A. Powles S.

In fact, BLAST (47Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar, 48Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2380) Google Scholar) analysis revealed that this residue is strictly conserved in aroA genes; notably, only EPSPS from Chlamydia species contain an isoleucine at the equivalent position. The decreased catalytic efficiency of the T97I mutant EPSPS with respect to utilization of PEP may explain why it has not been observed in glyphosate-resistant weeds and probably why it has not been exploited for the genetic engineering of crops. Although the TIPS enzyme is significantly less catalytically efficient than the wild-type enzyme, its high affinity for PEP apparently enables crops with this gene to have sufficient EPSPS activity to produce crop yields that are commercially competitive. Spontaneous double mutations of Thr97 and Pro101 in wild-type EPSPS are unlikely to occur. However, under the selective pressure caused by the presence of high glyphosate concentrations, it may be favorable for plants or bacteria with already established Pro101 mutations to acquire the additional mutation of Thr97, which would confer a very high level of resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2040091143,"Cyclotides are a family of plant defense proteins that are highly resistant to adverse chemical, thermal, and enzymatic treatment. Here, we present the first crystal structure of a cyclotide, varv F, from the European field pansy, Viola arvensis, determined at a resolution of 1.8 A. The solution state NMR structure was also determined and, combined with measurements of biophysical parameters for several cyclotides, provided an insight into the structural features that account for the remarkable stability of the cyclotide family. The x-ray data confirm the cystine knot topology and the circular backbone, and delineate a conserved network of hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the cyclotide fold. The structural role of a highly conserved Glu residue that has been shown to regulate cyclotide function was also determined, verifying its involvement in a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. We also demonstrate that varv F binds to dodecylphosphocholine micelles, defining the binding orientation and showing that its structure remains unchanged upon binding, further demonstrating that the cyclotide fold is rigid. This study provides a biological insight into the mechanism by which cyclotides maintain their native activity in the unfavorable environment of predator insect guts. It also provides a structural basis for explaining how a cluster of residues important for bioactivity may be involved in self-association interactions in membranes. As well as being important for their bioactivity, the structural rigidity of cyclotides makes them very suitable as a stable template for peptide-based drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2069408870,"This paper connects Alu repeats, the most abundant repetitive elements in the human genome and microRNAs, small RNAs that alter gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Base-pair complementarity could be demonstrated between the seed sequence of a subset of human microRNAs and Alu repeats that are integrated parallel (sense) in mRNAs. The most common target site coincides with the evolutionary most conserved part of Alu. A primate-specific gene cluster on chromosome 19 encodes the majority of miRNAs that target the most conserved sense Alu site. The individual miRNA genes within this cluster are flanked by an Alu-LINE signature, which has been duplicated with the clustered miRNA genes. Gene duplication events in this locus are supported by comparing repeat length variations of the LINE elements within the cluster with those in the rest of the chromosome. Thus, a dual relationship exists between an evolutionary young miRNA cluster and their Alu targets that may have evolved in the same time window. One hypothesis for this dual relationship is that these miRNAs could protect against too high rates of duplicative transposition, which would destroy the genome."

A major example of such sex dimorphism in mouse involves hepatic drug metabolism, which is also a noticeable target of circadian timekeeping. However, whether the circadian clock itself contributes to sex-biased metabolism has remained unknown, although several daily output parameters differ between sexes in a number of species, including humans. Here we show that dimorphic liver metabolism is altered when the circadian regulators Cryptochromes, Cry1 and Cry2, are inactivated. Indeed, double mutant Cry1–/– Cry2–/– male mice that lack a functional circadian clock express a number of sex-specific liver products, including several cytochrome P450 enzymes, at levels close to those measured in females. In addition, body growth of Cry-deficient mice is impaired, also in a sex-biased manner, and this phenotype goes along with an altered pattern of circulating growth hormone (GH) in mutant males, specifically. It is noteworthy that hormonal injections able to mimic male GH pulses reversed the feminized gene expression profile in the liver of Cry1–/– Cry2–/– males. Altogether, our observations suggest that the 24-h clock paces the dimorphic ultradian pulsatility of GH that is responsible for sex-dependent liver activity. We thus conclude that circadian timing, sex dimorphism, and liver metabolism are finely interconnected. In mammals, males and females exhibit anatomical, hormonal, and metabolic differences.

Phenotypic differences between males and females of a given species exist from invertebrates to humans and cover various features including disease susceptibility and life span, for example. Although the anatomical and hormonal differences between sexes are well described, few genetic determinants are known to account for sexual dimorphism in mammals. Recent genome-wide studies on various mouse tissues showed that major differences in gene expression between males and females involve drug metabolism (1Rinn J.L. Rozowsky J.S. Laurenzi I.J.

Pharmacokinet. 2003; 42: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) but also underscore the importance of considering sex issues in studies on liver metabolism. Interestingly, liver activity also fluctuates along the light-dark cycle and is a noticeable target of circadian timekeeping (7Gachon F. Olela F.F. Schaad O. Descombes P. Schibler U.

Both systemic cues and a circadian clock within hepatocytes are involved in daily oscillations of liver metabolism (10Kornmann B. Schaad O. Bujard H. Takahashi J.S. Schibler U.

However, because most of these studies were focused on males exclusively, the possible interaction between circadian oscillators and sex dimorphism of hepatic activity is not documented. This prompted us to investigate whether circadian cogwheels could also be involved in the sexual dimorphism observed at the hepatic level. Indeed, several daily output parameters differ between sexes in a number of species, including humans (12Daan S. Damassa D. Pittendrigh C.S. Smith E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We therefore assessed liver activity in homozygous double mutant Cryptochrome 1 and 2 males and females (hereafter referred to as Cry–/– mice) that are devoid of a functional circadian clock (17van der Horst G.T.

Livers were rapidly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. Total RNA extraction was done with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA by using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligonucleotide random hexamers. Primers of the mouse mRNAs to be investigated were designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) or Beacon Designer (Premier Biosoft) and checked for specificity using the BLAST program. In general, PCR primers were chosen to introduce a minimum of a two-nucleotide mismatch with all related Cyp subfamily members. Results presented for Cyp3a41 may actually represent the combined contribution of Cyp3a41 and Cyp3a16 RNA because the primers bring only one single nucleotide mismatch in between the two forms and theoretical amplicons with 96% homology that may not be distinguished by the dissociation curve of amplified products conducted to verify the unicity of amplified products. Real-time PCR was performed and analyzed using a 7500 Fast real-time PCR system with SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression levels were determined using the comparative CT method to normalize target gene mRNA to Gapdh. Microsome Preparation and Assessment of Cytochrome P450 Enzymatic Activity-Two-month-old mice were sacrificed at ZT4, and their livers were rapidly dissected, homogenized in homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose) with the addition of phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 10 mm sodium fluoride) and a protease inhibitor (100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 15 min to obtain a total tissue homogenate. Microsomal pellets were separated from cytosolic supernatant by ultracentrifugation and suspended in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 20% glycerol. Microsomal protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. Testosterone hydroxylase activity was measured as described previously (18Reinerink E.J. Doorn L. Jansen E.H. Van Iersel A.A. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 553: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Liver microsomes were tested at 1 mg of proteins/ml in 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, for testosterone hydroxylase activity using 300 μm of 14C-labeled testosterone as a substrate. In addition, 5α-reductase activity was inhibited by the addition of 5 μm finasteride to the incubation mixture. The NADPH-regenerating system was composed of 10 mm glucose-6-phosphate, 5 IU/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 10 mm MgCl2 in 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm NADPH. The incubation, at 37 °C, lasted 15 min, and the reaction was stopped using a mixture of 3 ml of dichloromethane and 65 nmol of 11β-hydroxytestosterone (UV internal standard). Each sample was vigorously vortexed and centrifuged. Two ml of organic phase were transferred to a clean glass test tube and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen gas. Nitrogen-dried dichloromethane extracts were dissolved in a mixture of 0.1 m ammonium acetate/methanol/acetonitrile. Testosterone metabolites were separated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, using Symmetry C18 column 5 μm (220 × 2.1 mm), heated at 55 °C. The mobile phases used were (phase A) 0.1 m ammonium acetate; 30% methanol and (phase B) 0.1 m ammonium acetate; 70% methanol. Hydroxylated metabolites were monitored by UV at 247 nm and by radioactivity detection and eluted with a linear gradient: 0.7% of phase B/min at a flow rate of 350 μl/min. Hydroxylated testosterone (OHT) standards (2α-OHT, 2β-OHT, 6α-OHT, 6β-OHT, 7α-OHT, 11β-OHT, 15α-OHT, 15β-OHT, 16α-OHT, 16β-OHT) were used to identify testosterone metabolites. Determination of MUPs Levels in Urine-Urine was collected at ZT4 and briefly centrifuged (3 min at 8800 × g). The supernatant was diluted (1/20) with 2× Laemmli buffer and heated at 90 °C for 90 s. Routinely, 8 μl of urine solution were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Relative amounts of proteins in the molecular weight range of 20,000 were estimated by integrating band density, expressed in arbitrary units. Hormonal Assays-Circulating hormones were measured from trunk blood collected in heparinized centrifuge tubes for plasma preparation. For pituitary content, anterior pituitary glands were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline. Assays were performed using a testosterone enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Cayman Chemical), according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and a GH-specific radioimmunoassay using reagents provided by A. F. Parlow. The Sex Dimorphism in Liver Activity Is Impaired in Cry–/– Mice-To determine whether circadian clock components impact on differences between males and females, we assessed by real-time quantitative PCR the expression of several dimorphic genes in the liver of male and female mice sacrificed at selected time points around the light-dark cycle and compared their expression level in control and double homozygous Cry–/– mice. Sexually dimorphic genes include members of the cytochrome P450 (Cyp) family that are involved in the hydroxylation of steroid hormones and various chemicals, and Elovl3, involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (1Rinn J.L. Rozowsky J.S. Laurenzi I.J. Petersen P.H. Zou K. Zhong W. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In control animals, we found that the difference in expression between males and females persists all along the light-dark cycle for most of the genes considered (Fig. 1). As reported previously (19Anzulovich A. Mir A. Brewer M. Ferreyra G. Vinson C. Baler R. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2690-2700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Brolinson A. Fourcade S. Jakobsson A. Pujol A. Jacobsson A. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 3158-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Elovl3 exhibits daily variations in male liver and is hardly detectable in females at any time point (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the male-female dimorphism is strongly reduced in Cry–/– mice. Indeed, the male-predominant genes Cyp2d9, Cyp4a12, and Cyp7b1 are significantly down-regulated along the light-dark cycle in male Cry–/– livers, whereas modest, if any, alteration is noticed in females (Fig. 1). The expression of Elovl3 becomes constitutively low, and daily variations are abolished in male livers. Conversely, the female-predominant gene Cyp2b9 is significantly up-regulated in Cry–/– mutant males, which dramatically increased the expression ratio between males and females (Fig. 1, inset). Hence, inactivation of Cry1 and Cry2 genes leads to a feminization of the expression patterns of several genes in the male liver. The different expression patterns of Cyp genes between sexes are believed to affect the rate of metabolism for a given substrate directly. To assess whether the feminized gene expression profile of Cry–/– males is translated at the metabolic level, we measured the activity of microsomal hydroxylases. Levels of the male-predominant testosterone 16α-hydroxylase activity tend to become similar in microsomes from Cry–/– males and females (Fig. 2, A and D). In parallel, the sexual dimorphism in production of the female-predominant metabolites 6α-OH and 7α-OH testosterone is reduced in Cry–/– mice as compared with wild types (Fig. 2, B and D). Although testosterone metabolites cannot be reliably ascribed to individual Cyp forms, these findings mirror our results obtained with quantitative PCR and support that metabolic sex dimorphism is altered in Cry–/– mice. It is worth noting that the feminization of Cry–/– males is incomplete and does not extend to all sexually dimorphic genes of liver metabolism. For example, the male-female difference in expression of the female-predominant gene Cyp3a41 remains unchanged in Cry–/– animals (Fig. 1). Similarly, the female-predominant testosterone 15β-hydroxylase activity is not altered in either Cry–/– males or females (Fig. 2, C and D). Moreover, Cry–/– males are fertile 4I. M. Bur, A. M. Cohen-Solal. and X Bonnefont, unpublished observations. and exhibit normal levels of circulating testosterone (3784 ± 1099 pg/ml, n = 8, and 2996 ± 860 pg/ml, n = 6, in wild type and Cry–/– males, respectively, p > 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test), which is in contrast with another mutant mouse line lacking the circadian clock protein BMAL1 (21Alvarez J.D. Hansen A. Ord T. Bebas P. Chappell P.E. Giebultowicz J.M. Williams C. Moss S. Sehgal A. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2008; 23: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the feminization of the liver of Cry–/– mutant males is not driven by impaired gonadic function. Instead, a definite pathway must be altered downstream the testicular activity, leading to the partial feminization of the liver. Dimorphic Traits Dependent on Ultradian GH Pulsatility Are Feminized in Cry–/– Males-Ultradian profiles of circulating GH are a key mediator for sex-dependent effects on the liver in many species (3Ahluwalia A. Clodfelter K.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 747-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Legraverend C. Mode A. Wells T. Robinson I. Gustafsson J.A.

Indeed, a major difference between males and females in both rats and mice is the sustained (3–4 h) interpulse interval of low GH between peaks of secretion (25MacLeod J.N. Pampori N.A. Shapiro B.H. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Tannenbaum G.S. Martin J.B. Endocrinology. 1976; 98: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), required for the expression of male-specific liver genes (27Dhir R.N. Shapiro B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15224-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These sex differences in GH patterns largely contribute to the sexual dimorphism in body growth (28Clark R.G. Jansson J.O. Isaksson O. Robinson I.C. J. Endocrinol. 1985; 104: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The pulsatile GH release is also well known for increasing the synthesis of major urinary proteins (MUPs) in the liver of males and their subsequent accumulation in urine (29Low M.J. Otero-Corchon V. Parlow A.F. Ramirez J.L. Kumar U. Patel Y.C. Rubinstein M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 30Norstedt G. Palmiter R. Cell. 1984; 36: 805-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to rely on these two parameters, body growth and MUPs content, as indirect readouts of GH pulsatility. Firstly, previous studies reported that clock-deficient Bmal1–/– or Cry–/– mice are significantly smaller than control animals (31Kondratov R.V. Kondratova A.A. Gorbacheva V.Y. Vykhovanets O.V. Antoch M.P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1868-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 32Masuki S. Todo T. Nakano Y. Okamura H. Nose H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 566: 213-224Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Sun Y. Yang Z. Niu Z. Wang W. Peng J. Li Q. Ma M.Y. Zhao Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 2006; 13: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This prompted us to systematically compare the postnatal growth of Cry–/– males and females. Double mutant Cry1–/– Cry2–/– animals of either sex exhibit a marked reduction in size and show a 10–20% reduction of body weight as compared with littermates bearing at least one wild type allele of either Cry gene (Fig. 3A). This growth deficit first becomes apparent at 2–3 weeks after birth, which matches the onset of the somatotroph axis (28Clark R.G. Jansson J.O. Isaksson O. Robinson I.C. J. Endocrinol. 1985; 104: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Importantly, the growth deficiency of Cry–/– mice is more pronounced in males than in females, leading to a decrease of sex dimorphism in body growth as emphasized by the lower body weight ratio between males and females in mutant animals as compared with wild type mice (Fig. 3B). Secondly, to estimate the accumulation of MUPs, urine from matched control and Cry–/– males and females was collected and analyzed by electrophoresis. We found that MUPs levels are dramatically decreased in the urine of male Cry–/– mice as compared with wild type males (Fig. 3C). This is not due to a deficiency in urine concentration because urine osmolarity is even slightly higher in Cry–/– mice than in control animals (2397 ± 184 mosm/kg H2O, n = 12 and 2451 ± 231 mosm/kg H2O, n = 9 for mutant males and females, respectively; 1871 ± 130 mosm/kg H2O, n = 11 and 1873 ± 316 mosm/kg H2O, n = 7 for wild type males and females, respectively). Rather, the decreased MUPs content in the urine of Cry–/– males is associated with the down-regulation of the Mup1 gene expression in their liver (Fig. 3D). Thus, both body growth and MUPs accumulation show impaired sex dimorphism in Cry–/– mice, suggesting that altered GH profiles may be responsible for their feminized metabolic pattern. Cry–/– Males Exhibit Altered Circulating GH Levels-The direct assessment of temporal GH patterns in the mouse, unlike in rat, is hampered by technical difficulties of repeated blood sampling in freely moving animals. To evaluate whether the inactivation of the Cry genes is associated with an altered GH secretion pattern, we collected trunk blood at random times from control and Cry–/– males and females. As reported previously (29Low M.J. Otero-Corchon V. Parlow A.F. Ramirez J.L. Kumar U. Patel Y.C. Rubinstein M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), control males and females show a similar distribution of their GH levels, except that maximal values are higher in males (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, 53% of the values obtained from male blood (16/30) were below 1 ng/ml, whereas this proportion falls to only 23% in females (7/30). It is likely that such a difference is the footprint of the long and short durations of GH troughs in between secretion peaks in males and females, respectively, as described in the single study that reported direct measurements of GH pulsatility in the mouse (25MacLeod J.N. Pampori N.A. Shapiro B.H. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The Cry deletion did not significantly alter the distribution of GH values in females. In contrast, GH levels were significantly shifted higher in Cry–/– males (Fig. 4A). Only 20% of random GH values were below 1 ng/ml (4/20), suggesting that GH trough duration is shorter than in control males. These data suggest that the ultradian GH profile is altered in Cry–/– males with reduced non-secreting episodes. Accordingly, we found that total pituitary GH contents from wild type males are scattered along a wide range of values (Fig. 4B), which possibly depicts the alternating course of GH surges and troughs, whereas the narrow pattern obtained with glands from Cry–/– males resembles the distribution of values from females (Fig. 4B). However, although GH patterns are altered in Cry–/– males, their pituitary gland remains able to secrete a high amount of GH when stimulated with the intravenous injection of 100 ng of GH-releasing hormone or synthetic GH-releasing hexapeptide GHRP6 (data not shown). Moreover, although we noticed a slight down-regulation of the GH receptor, Ghr, in the liver of Cry–/– males, no important alteration were found in the somatotroph liver outputs, such as genes coding for the insulin-like growth factor Igf1 and its binding protein Igfbp3 (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our data show that the Cry–/– mutation alters the GH tempo. Interestingly, it is already known that the internal circadian clock gets less robust (34Hastings M.H. Reddy A.B. Maywood E.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) and that the somatotroph axis dampens (35Kuwahara S. Sari D.K. Tsukamoto Y. Tanaka S. Sasaki F. Brain Res. 2004; 998: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) during aging. To investigate whether these alterations may affect sex dimorphism in liver metabolism, we compared liver genes expression between young and old male mice. We found that aged wild type male mice have a feminized liver gene pattern (Fig. 5), as reported previously in rats (27Dhir R.N. Shapiro B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15224-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although slight differences can be noted, the liver of young Cry–/– and old wild type males are therefore submitted to similar changes as compared with young control animals (Figs. 1 and 5). Hence, we reasoned that circadian timekeeping may pace the GH pulsatility that is responsible for male-specific liver activity and body growth. Mimicking GH Pulses Reverses the Feminized Phenotype of Cry–/– Males-If our hypothesis is correct that altered GH profiles are responsible for the loss of sex dimorphism, it should be possible to reverse the hepatic feminization by reinstating GH pulses and interpulses in Cry–/– males. Accordingly, we administered bovine GH (50 μg/mouse) at 12-h intervals during 1 week to Cry–/– males, a protocol previously shown to masculinize hepatic gene expression in wild type female mice (23Jarukamjorn K. Sakuma T. Jaruchotikamol A. Ishino Y. Oguro M. Nemoto N. Toxicology. 2006; 219: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This treatment restores typical male Mup1 mRNA levels and reverses the feminized pattern of hepatic Cyp2b9, Cyp2d9, Cyp4a12, Cyp7b1, and Elovl3 in Cry–/– males to levels similar to those measured in untreated wild type males (Fig. 6). To exclude a spurious effect from high concentrations of exogenous GH, we forced the pituitary gland of Cry–/– males to secrete endogenous GH in a pulsatile manner but without generating excess GH exposure. Because patterned infusions of somatostatin can elicit rebound bursts of GH (36Clark R.G. Robinson I.C. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2675-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we repeatedly injected octreotide (50 ng/mouse every 12 h), a long lasting somatostatin agonist, to Cry–/– males. This treatment also rescues a male pattern of liver gene expression in the mutant mice (Fig. 6), and confirms that rhythmic activation of the GH axis, with regular and sustained low trough values of GH, is responsible for the reversal of the feminized phenotype of the Cry–/– male liver. Circadian Timekeeping as a Regulator of Ultradian GH Release-Altogether, our data reveal Cry1 and Cry2 as genetic determinants of sexual dimorphism in liver metabolism. The presence of functional CRY products appears essential for tuning the ultradian GH pulsatility required for the male-specific liver activity. Similarly, previous studies reported that the circadian clock gene Bmal1 is also necessary to maintain male-female differences in body growth (33Sun Y. Yang Z. Niu Z. Wang W. Peng J. Li Q. Ma M.Y. Zhao Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 2006; 13: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or that liver expression of Elovl3 follows a female-like profile in male homozygous Clock/Clock mutants (19Anzulovich A. Mir A. Brewer M. Ferreyra G. Vinson C. Baler R. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2690-2700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, male rats with lesioned SCN exhibit a feminized steroid metabolism (37Gustafsson J.A. Eneroth P. Hokfelt T. Skett P. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), as we observed for Cry–/– mice. Last, the alteration of circadian timekeeping during aging (34Hastings M.H. Reddy A.B. Maywood E.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) is concomitant with dampening of the GH pulsatility (35Kuwahara S. Sari D.K. Tsukamoto Y. Tanaka S. Sasaki F. Brain Res. 2004; 998: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and leads to the feminization of liver gene expression in rats (27Dhir R.N. Shapiro B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15224-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and mice (this study). Thus, although we cannot exclude a non-circadian role for Cry genes, we conclude that the feminized phenotype of Cry–/– males is at least partly due to the disruption of their circadian clock. The SCN transiently synchronize the GH rhythm with the light-dark cycle, likely through somatostatinergic neurons (38Davies J.S. Carter D.A. Wells T. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2950-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 39Willoughby J.O. Martin J.B. Brain Res. 1978; 151: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and male rats with SCN lesions present alterations in the amplitude of ultradian GH pulses (39Willoughby J.O. Martin J.B. Brain Res. 1978; 151: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the alteration of GH secretion in Cry–/– may result from impaired circadian outputs from their SCN (40Albus H.

Indeed, the SCN, equipped with receptors for gonadal hormones (15Karatsoreos I.N. Wang A. Sasanian J. Silver R. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 5487-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Vida B. Hrabovszky E. Kalamatianos T. Coen C.W. Liposits Z. Kallo I. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2008; 20: 1270-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), may indirectly tune the GH secretion profiles responsible for dimorphic liver metabolism. Another hypothesis, not exclusive from the former one, is that the circadian clockwork within the pituitary gland may synchronize unitary ultradian activities of GH-secreting cells (41Bonnefont X. Fiekers J. Creff A. Mollard P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 42Bonnefont X. Mollard P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) through long distance homotypic cell networks (43Bonnefont X. Lacampagne A. Sanchez-Hormigo A. Fino E. Creff A. Mathieu M.N. Smallwood S. Carmignac D. Fontanaud P. Travo P. Alonso G. Courtois-Coutry N. Pincus S.M. Robinson I.C. Mollard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 8891-8896Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although such a possibility remains to be investigated, it is worth noting that circadian timekeeping is known to interfere with other rhythms outside the 24-h range, such as ultradian courtship song in flies (45Kyriacou C.P. Hall J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6729-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and infradian estrous cycles in mice (46Miller B.H. Olson S.L. Turek F.W. Levine J.E. Horton T.H. Takahashi J.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1367-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The GH secretion profile in Cry–/– males differs from that of control males, with fewer trough values. However, it remains distinct from the female GH pattern, which exhibits a lower mean level. Thus, Cry–/– males have a unique GH profile that leads to a female-like metabolic pattern. However, this feminization is not complete and underscores the complex regulation of sexually dimorphic liver genes, which mainly involves transduction through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b) and hepatic nuclear factor 4 α (HNF4α) pathways (47Clodfelter K.H.

For example, the expression level of the female-predominant gene Cyp3a41 is not altered in Cry–/– mutants. Interestingly, several genes of the Cyp3a family, including Cyp3a41, were previously reported to be resilient to the inactivation of STAT5b (47Clodfelter K.H. Holloway M.G. Hodor P. Park S.H. Ray W.J. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1333-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) but not of HNF4α (49Wiwi C.A. Gupte M. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1975-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our data may thus define a new paradigm to study the sexually dimorphic action of GH in the mammalian liver through both transduction cascades. Interrelationship between Circadian Timekeeping, Sex Dimorphism, and Liver Metabolism-Finally, our data reveal that circadian timekeeping may control cell and body metabolism by pacing the secretion of pituitary GH, in addition to the well known direct regulation at the transcription level in liver cells (7Gachon F.

Over the last decades, chronomedecine has been developed, assuming that a circadian control of sensitivity to drugs exists in humans as well as in rodents (7Gachon F. Olela F.F. Schaad O.

https://openalex.org/W2089546868,"Mutation of the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase OCRL1 causes the X-linked disorder oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe, characterized by defects in the brain, kidneys, and eyes. OCRL1 exists as two splice isoforms that differ by a single exon encoding 8 amino acids. The longer protein, termed isoform a, is the only form in brain, whereas both isoforms are present in all other tissues. The significance of OCRL1 splicing is currently unclear. Given its proximity to a clathrin-binding site, we hypothesized that splicing may alter the clathrin binding properties of OCRL1. Here we show that this is indeed the case. OCRL1 isoform a binds clathrin with higher affinity than isoform b and is significantly more enriched in clathrin-coated trafficking intermediates. We also identify a second clathrin-binding site in OCRL1 that contributes to clathrin binding of both isoforms. Association of OCRL1 with clathrin-coated intermediates requires membrane association through interaction with Rab GTPases but not binding to the clathrin adaptor AP2. Expression of OCRL1 isoform a lacking the 5-phosphatase domain impairs transferrin endocytosis, whereas an equivalent version of isoform b does not. Our results suggest that OCRL1 exists as two functional pools, one participating in clathrin-mediated trafficking events such as endocytosis and another that is much less or not involved in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2029878872,"Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases play essential roles in cell signaling and membrane trafficking. They are divided into type II and III families, which have distinct structural and enzymatic properties and are essentially unrelated in sequence. Mammalian cells express two type II isoforms, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIalpha (PI4KIIalpha) and IIbeta (PI4KIIbeta). Nearly all of PI4KIIalpha, and about half of PI4KIIbeta, associates integrally with membranes, requiring detergent for solubilization. This tight membrane association is because of palmitoylation of a cysteine-rich motif, CCPCC, located within the catalytic domains of both type II isoforms. Deletion of this motif from PI4KIIalpha converts the kinase from an integral to a tightly bound peripheral membrane protein and abrogates its catalytic activity ( Barylko, B., Gerber, S. H., Binns, D. D., Grichine, N., Khvotchev, M., Sudhof, T. C., and Albanesi, J. P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 7705-7708 ). Here we identify the first two cysteines in the CCPCC motif as the principal sites of palmitoylation under basal conditions, and we demonstrate the importance of the central proline for enzymatic activity, although not for membrane binding. We further show that palmitoylation is critical for targeting PI4KIIalpha to the trans-Golgi network and for enhancement of its association with low buoyant density membrane fractions, commonly termed lipid rafts. Replacement of the four cysteines in CCPCC with a hydrophobic residue, phenylalanine, substantially restores catalytic activity of PI4KIIalpha in vitro and in cells without restoring integral membrane binding. Although this FFPFF mutant displays a perinuclear distribution, it does not strongly co-localize with wild-type PI4KIIalpha and associates more weakly with lipid rafts."
https://openalex.org/W2085380117,"In order to maintain cohesion of groups, social animals need to process social information efficiently. Visual individual recognition, which is distinguished from mere visual discrimination, has been studied in only few mammalian species. In addition, most previous studies used either a small number of subjects or a few various views as test stimuli. Dairy cattle, as a domestic species allow the testing of a good sample size and provide a large variety of test stimuli due to the morphological diversity of breeds. Hence cattle are a suitable model for studying individual visual recognition. This study demonstrates that cattle display visual individual recognition and shows the effect of both familiarity and coat diversity in discrimination.We tested whether 8 Prim'Holstein heifers could recognize 2D-images of heads of one cow (face, profiles, (3/4) views) from those of other cows. Experiments were based on a simultaneous discrimination paradigm through instrumental conditioning using food rewards. In Experiment 1, all images represented familiar cows (belonging to the same social group) from the Prim'Holstein breed. In Experiments 2, 3 and 4, images were from unfamiliar (unknown) individuals either from the same breed or other breeds. All heifers displayed individual recognition of familiar and unfamiliar individuals from their own breed. Subjects reached criterion sooner when recognizing a familiar individual than when recognizing an unfamiliar one (Exp 1: 3.1+/-0.7 vs. Exp 2: 5.2+/-1.2 sessions; Z = 1.99, N = 8, P = 0.046). In addition almost all subjects recognized unknown individuals from different breeds, however with greater difficulty.Our results demonstrated that cattle have efficient individual recognition based on categorization capacities. Social familiarity improved their performance. The recognition of individuals with very different coat characteristics from the subjects was the most difficult task. These results call for studies exploring the mechanisms involved in face recognition allowing interspecies comparisons, including humans."

Previous surveys have identified 160 mRNAs that are bound by αCP in the human hematopoietic cell line, K562. To explore the functions of these αCP/mRNA interactions, we identified mRNAs whose levels are altered in K562 cells acutely depleted of the two major αCP proteins, αCP1 and αCP2. Microarray analysis identified 27 mRNAs that are down-regulated and 14 mRNAs that are up-regulated in the αCP1/2-co-depleted cells. This αCP1/2 co-depletion was also noted to inhibit cell proliferation and trigger a G1 cell cycle arrest. Targeted analysis of genes involved in cell cycle control revealed a marked increase in p21WAF mRNA and protein. Analysis of mRNP complexes in K562 cells demonstrates in vivo association of p21WAF mRNA with αCP1 and αCP2.

The apparent redundancy in the actions of αCP1 and αCP2 upon p21WAF expression correlates with a parallel redundancy in their effects on cell cycle control.

Taken together, these studies indicate that αCPs constitute key regulators in a wide spectrum of post-transcriptional controls. To develop an understanding of how αCPs impact on cell function, we have screened for in vivo binding targets. Microarray analysis of immunoenriched αCP2-mRNP complexes isolated from K562 cells (30Waggoner S.A. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7055-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) revealed 160 αCP2-associated mRNAs. These mRNAs could be clustered according to the function(s) of their encoded proteins, suggesting roles for αCP2 in coordination of post-transcriptional controls. One of the larger functional clusters consisted of mRNAs that affect cell growth and proliferation. A role for αCP2 in cell cycle control was consistent with prior observations that a member of the αCP family, αCP4, can induce cell cycle arrest at G2-M and stimulate apoptosis (31Castano Z. Vergara-Irigaray N. Pajares M.J. Montuenga L.M. Pio R. Int. J. Cancer. 2008; 122: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Zhu J. Chen X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5602-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The current study was initiated to assign functions to αCP interactions with cellular mRNAs (30Waggoner S.A. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7055-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To accomplish this goal, we acutely depleted K562 cells of αCP1 and αCP2, either separately or together, and identified mRNAs that were either induced or repressed in their steady state levels. During the course of these studies, we observed that the αCP1/2 co-depletion decreased cell proliferation and triggered a G1 arrest. The basis of the mitotic arrest was explored by determining the effect of the αCP1/2 co-depletion on the expression of genes that play pivotal roles in cell cycle control. These studies revealed an induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) mRNA and protein. CDKN1A is also known as wild-type p53 activated fragment (p21WAF), and we will use this designation throughout. The induction of p21WAF mRNA and protein correlated with the G1 arrest. p21WAF mRNA was found to be associated with both αCP1 and αCP2 mRNP complexes in untreated cells, and the induction of p21WAF mRNA subsequent to αCP1/2 co-depletion was mechanistically linked to prolongation of the p21WAF mRNA half-life. These data lead us to conclude that αCP1 and αCP2 play a role in cell cycle control via a p53-independent, post-transcriptional modulation of p21WAF gene expression. Cell Growth and siRNA Transfection-K562 cells (ATCC number CCL-243) were propagated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) under standard conditions.

In experiments in which αCP1 or αCP2 siRNAs were used individually, the αCP siRNA was supplemented with lamin A/C siRNA to bring the total siRNA content to 20 μg. Western Blot Analysis-Radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline) lysates were isolated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad D/C kit. Extracts prepared from HCT116 cells that had been treated with 50 μm irinotecan for 24 h were provided (kind gift of N. Finnberg; W. El-Deiry laboratory, University of Pennsylvania). αCP1, αCP2, and rpL7 antibodies were generated by our laboratory; antibodies to p53 and p21WAF were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and lamin A/C, CCNH, and RB antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibody-bound proteins were visualized by Western analysis using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Isolation and Microarray Analysis-Analysis of a G4112A hybridization microarray (Agilent) representing 25,584 human genes was performed by Mogene using a 2-μg aliquot of total RNA isolated from cells 2 days post-siRNA transfection (RNAeasy; Qiagen). qRT-PCR Analysis-cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (1 μg) (Reaction Ready First Strand cDNA Synthesis; SuperArray), and the cDNA product, diluted 13-fold with H2O, was used as a template for quantitative PCR (RT2 Sybr Green/Rox; SuperArray or Taqman reagents; ABI). The following sets of primers were purchased from ABI: FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1) (Hs00203685_m1), RASSF5 (Ras association domain family protein 5) (Hs00739100_m1), and RIG-I (Hs00204833_m1). The following sets of primers were purchased from SuperArray: CCNH (PPH00969A), HIF1α (PPH01361A), PHGDH (PPH07199A), and UBCH2 (PPH18206A). Reactions were run in triplicate on an ABI Prism 7700, and the data were analyzed using Sequence Detection Software version 1.9.1. The Ct values obtained are an average of the triplicates. Analysis of the Cell Cycle and Viability-Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed on cells 4 and 5 days post-siRNA transfection (Easycyte Mini; Guava). Cell cycle reagent (containing propidium iodide) was used to analyze the cell cycle, and a minimum of 2000 cells were analyzed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Guava). The Viacount Dye Exclusion Assay was used to measure viability (Guava). RNA Co-purification-mRNA content in the immunoenriched RNP preparations was determined by RT-PCR as described (30Waggoner S.A.

Sarnow P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) using a p21WAF cDNA probe (Origene) labeled with 32P (RadPrime DNA Labeling Kit; Invitrogen). Band intensities were quantified on a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Cross-linking Immunoprecipitation Analysis-Plasmids containing a T7 promoter upstream of various regions corresponding to the p21WAF 3′-UTR were a kind gift of P.

The p21WAF 3′-UTR regions designated WAF1-A to WAF1-E (Fig. 7A) were amplified by PCR. The primers are indicated in Table 4. Note that each forward primer contained a T7 promoter (TAATACGACTCACTATAGG) at its 5′-end, which is not included in the primer sequences listed in Table 4. The p21WAF cDNA (Origene) was used as a template for the PCR. PCR was performed using the Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions except that we used 2× Pfx amplification buffer, 0.2 μg of template, 0.4 μl of Pfx DNA polymerase, and 1× PCRx enhancer per reaction. The conditions were 94 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 84 s; and 68 °C for 7 min. Fragments were gel-isolated using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Linearized plasmids or PCR products were used as templates for transcription of radiolabeled thiolated RNAs as described (30Waggoner S.A. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7055-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These RNAs contained thiolated uridines, which allow for cross-linking of the thiol group to a binding protein located within a few Å of the thiol moiety. The RNAs were incubated with cytoplasmic extract from K562 cells and irradiated at 312 nm to activate the protein/RNA cross-link. Following irradiation, the samples were treated with RNase A to remove the unprotected RNA. The samples were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to αCP1 or αCP2 (both generated by our laboratory) or c-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described (30Waggoner S.A. Liebhaber S.A. Mol.

Western blot analyses revealed that the αCP1 and αCP2 siRNAs selectively depleted their targeted proteins and that both αCPs isoforms were depleted when the two siRNAs were used in combination (Fig. 1A). Two controls were included to document specificity of siRNA actions: a “mock” transfection lacking only siRNAs and a transfection with an unrelated siRNA directed against lamin A/C. Expression of lamin A/C protein was unaffected by either of the αCP siRNAs but was effectively cleared by the lamin A/C siRNA. Alterations of mRNA Steady State Levels in αCP1/2-co-depleted Cells-To identify cellular mRNAs whose expression is modulated by αCP1 and αCP2, RNA isolated from control and αCP1/2-co-depleted cells were compared by microarray analysis. The study included six sets of microarray hybridizations, beginning each time with an independent siRNA transfection; three of these studies compared combined treatment with αCP1 and αCP2 siRNAs (“αCP1/2 co-depletion”) with mock-transfected cells, and the other three compared the co-depletion with lamin A/C siRNA treatment. 41 mRNAs were altered 1.7-fold or more in both of these comparisons. Table 1 identifies each mRNA by GenBank™ accession number, average -fold changes, and putative function(s) of the encoded proteins, as identified by GO (gene ontology) terms, OMIM (online Mendelian inheritance in man), and/or manual literature searches. The mRNAs are ranked according to the average -fold change of all six experiments. There were 27 down-regulated mRNAs and 14 up-regulated mRNAs. The mRNAs encoding αCP1 and αCP2 ranked highest on this list of down-regulated mRNAs, with αCP2 (or its variants) ranked at number 1, 2, and 6 with -fold changes of –7, –7, and –3 compared with mock and –5, –4, and –3 compared with lamin A/C. Likewise, αCP1 ranked at number 3 with a -fold change of –4 compared with mock or lamin A/C. These results validate the effective siRNA targeting of αCP1 and αCP2 mRNAs. The fourth highest ranking candidate is the mRNA encoding the cell cycle regulator, CCNH (cyclin H). This mRNA was decreased by 6-fold when αCP1/2 co-depletion was compared with mock depletion and by 3-fold when compared with lamin A/C. The mRNA encoding HIF1α (hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1α) ranked at number 10. In the list of mRNAs that were up-regulated by the αCP1/2 co-depletion, an anonymous mRNA ranked the highest, with a 6-fold increase in its steady state level when compared with mock and an 11-fold increase when compared with lamin A/C.TABLE 141 mRNAs altered in steady state level in cells depleted of αCP1 and αCP2mRNA nameAccession no.AFCaAFC, average -fold change. versus mockaAFC, average -fold change.AFC versus lamin A/CFunctionDown-regulatedαCP2, transcript variant 1NM_005016-7-4.5mRNA metabolism and expressionStrong similarity to αCP2I_1903441-6.6-4.1mRNA metabolism and expressionαCP1NM_006196-3.5-3.5mRNA metabolism and expressionCyclin H (CCNH)NM_001239-5.5-3.4Regulation of cell cycleUnknownI_1931775-4-3UnknownαCP2I_932189-3.2-3.2mRNA metabolism and expressionChromosome ORF 30NM_014145-4-3UnknownUnknownI_3585116-3-2.8UnknownFatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1)NM_013402-3.2-2.4Fatty acid unsaturationHypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif1α)I_958733-2.1-2.9HypoxiaUnknownENST00000-2.9-3.1UnknownUnknownTHC152941-2.4-2.5UnknownHypothetical protein FLJ37478NM_178557-2.3-2.5UnknowncDNA FLJ10004 clone HEMBA1000076AK000866-2.5-2.2UnknowncDNA FLJ90838 clone Y79AA1002129AK075319-2.5-2.1UnknownHypothetical protein FLJ25006NM_144610-2.3-2.2UnknownRas association domain 5 (RASSF5)NM_031437-2.4-2.1Ras effectorUnknownTHC157597-2.4-2.1UnknownAldo-ketoreductase 7, A2 (AKR7A2)NM_003689-2.5-2Aldehyde and ketone detoxificationcDNA DKFZp547F1714AL831830-2.1-2.2UnknownWD repeat SOCS box 2 (WSB2)NM_018639-2.4-2UnknownSingle-stranded DNA-binding protein 4 (SSBP4)NM_032627-2.2-2UnknownN-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GALNT11)NM_022087-1.9-1.7Glycosylation of mucinsRepressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA)NM_007273-2.1-2.1UnknownRibosome-binding protein 1I_961859-2.2-1.9Translation and cardiac developmentFLJ00069AK024476-2.1-2UnknownNovel chromosome 22 geneAL365511-2-1.9UnknownUp-regulatedUnknownTHC15701575.910.6UnknowncDNA FLJ12961 clone NT2RP2005645AK0230232.62.6UnknownAngiomotin-like 1 (AMOTL1)NM_1308472.72.5Control of angiogenesisPhosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH)NM_0066232.23Serine biosynthesisUbiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UbcH2)Z293282.33.3Ubiquitination of cellular substratesmRNA adjacent to integrated HPV16 (INT423)AJ4316202.54.4UnknownKIAA1541 proteinAB04097433.8UnknownCytoskeletal tropomysoin isoform (3 kb)M1212722.3Actin-myosin interactionPhosphotyrosine and phosphoinositides adaptorNM_0143952.22.2Signal transductionUnknownXM_2096282.12.5UnknownUnknownTHC11416592.42.5UnknowncDNA FLJ10656 clone NT2RP2006038AK00151823UnknownHypothetical protein FLJ10656 (P15RS)NM_0181702.32.5UnknownRNA helicase (RIG-1)AF0389632.32.8Antiviral signalinga AFC, average -fold change. Open table in a new tab Verification of the microarray data was carried out on selected mRNAs by targeted qRT-PCR (Table 2). The level of each mRNA was determined as the -fold change versus the mock transfection control and the -fold change versus the Lamin A/C siRNA control. The mRNA encoding CCNH was 3- and 2-fold lower in the αCP1/2 co-depleted cells compared with mock or lamin A/C knockdowns, respectively. Likewise, the mRNAs encoding HIF1α, FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1), and RASSF5 (Ras association domain family protein 5) were decreased in the αCP1/2-co-depleted cells, all in agreement with the microarray analysis. The increase in the levels of the mRNAs encoding PHGDH (phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase), RIG-1 (retinoic acid-inducible gene 1), and UbcH2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2H), as determined by the microarray analysis of αCP1/2 co-depleted cells, were confirmed by the qRT-PCR analysis, as was the lowest ranked up-regulated mRNA (rank number 14) in the microarray analysis (RIG-I; Table 1). These qRT-PCR studies support the reliability of the microarray data set.TABLE 2Verification of mRNAs that are altered in steady state level in the absence of αCP1 and αCP2mRNA nameAFCaAFC, average -fold change among two replicates of double knockdown. versus mockAFC versus lamin A/CDown-regulatedCCNH-2.8-2.2HIF1α-3-3.6FADS1-11.7-5.7RASSF5-3-3.4Up-regulatedPHGDH45.4RIG-I10.64UbcH22.41.8a AFC, average -fold change among two replicates of double knockdown. Open table in a new tab Expression of Cyclin H Is Decreased in αCP1/2-co-depleted Cells-Since CCNH mRNA was the most strongly down-regulated mRNA in the αCP1/2 co-depleted cells (excluding αCPs), we assessed the corresponding impact on CCNH protein. Western blot analysis was consistent with the mRNA analysis, revealing that CCNH protein was reduced by ∼50% in the αCP1/2-co-depleted cells (Fig. 1B). The levels of CCNH protein in cells individually depleted of either αCP1 or αCP2 were reduced by ∼20–30% in each case (data not shown). These data suggest that αCP1 or αCP2 can each regulate CCNH protein expression, but together the effect is additive. Taken together, the data support the conclusion that CCNH mRNA and protein are markedly and coordinately reduced in cells depleted for αCP1 and/or αCP2. Co-depletion of αCP1 and αCP2 Results in a G1 Cell Cycle Arrest-The observed reduction of CCNH protein in αCP-depleted cells suggested that αCP1 and αCP2 levels might impact on cell cycle kinetics. To test this possibility, αCP1 and αCP2 were depleted from K562 cells both individually and in combination, and cell replication parameters were evaluated in comparison with mock transfection and lamin A/C siRNA transfection controls. This analysis revealed a 53% reduction in cell number subsequent to co-depletion of αCP1 and αCP2 compared with mock-treated cells, and a 41% reduction in cell number when the αCP1/2 co-depletion was compared with lamin A/C siRNA-transfected cells at 4 days post-transfection of siRNAs. In contrast, there was no significant decrease in the density of cells individually depleted of αCP1 or αCP2 or in the controls (data not shown). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of cells transfected with siRNAs revealed that the αCP1/2 co-depletion resulted in accumulation of cells in the G1 phase that was not apparent in the mock-transfected or lamin A/C-transfected controls (Fig. 2). The G1 arrest in the αCP1/2 knockdown was observed in three independent knockdown studies. When αCP1/2-co-depleted cells were compared with control cells, the differences in the accumulation of G1 phase cells were highly significant (p = 0.0009 when compared with mock-transfected and p = 0.0023 when compared with lamin A/C siRNA-transfected cells). This G1 arrest was accompanied by a reciprocal decrease of cells in S phase (Fig. 2) that was significant when the double αCP1/2 knockdown was compared with mock-transfected (p = 0.0043) or with lamin A/C-transfected (p = 0.0068) cells. These alterations in the cell cycle were not observed in cells individually depleted for αCP1 or αCP2 (Fig. 2). There was no substantial impact on viability among the various treatments when assessed by dye exclusion (data not shown). Taken together, the data reveal that co-depletion of αCP1 and αCP2 reduced cellular proliferation and resulted in a G1 arrest. Phosphorylation of Serine 795 on the Retinoblastoma (RB) Protein Is Increased in the αCP1/2-co-depleted K562 Cells-The RB protein is a pivotal factor in the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle, and phosphorylation of specific residues in RB has been implicated in this activity (35Hatakeyama M. Weinberg R.A. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The observation that cells co-depleted of αCP1 and αCP2 accumulate in G1 led us to monitor for changes in the phosphorylation status of RB. Western blot analysis revealed that RB phosphorylation at Ser795 was increased in the αCP1/2-co-depleted cells relative to controls (Fig. 3A, top). There was also a slight but consistent increase of Ser795 phosphorylation in cells treated with lamin A/C siRNA relative to the mock treatment. Analysis of cells individually depleted for αCP1 revealed a slight increase in Ser795 phosphorylation, whereas the modification of this residue in the cells individually depleted of αCP2 remained unchanged (data not shown). The Western analysis of Ser780 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, middle) failed to reveal any changes in any of the co"

Here, using gel filtration chromatography, sedimentation, fluorescence, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and circular dichroism, we show that both fluorescently labeled and unlabeled RTA bind both to ER microsomal membranes and to negatively charged liposomes. The binding of RTA to the membrane at 0-30 °C exposes certain RTA residues to the nonpolar lipid core of the bilayer with little change in the secondary structure of the protein. However, major structural rearrangements in RTA occur when the temperature is increased. At 37 °C, membrane-bound toxin loses some of its helical content, and its C terminus moves closer to the membrane surface where it inserts into the bilayer. RTA is then stably bound to the membrane because it is nonextractable with carbonate. The sharp temperature dependence of the structural changes does not coincide with a lipid phase change because little change in fluorescence-detected membrane mobility occurred between 30 and 37 °C. Instead, the structural rearrangements may precede or initiate toxin retrotranslocation through the ER membrane to the cytosol. The sharp temperature dependence of these changes in RTA further suggests that they occur optimally in mammalian targets of the plant toxin.

There is evidence to suggest that once released to the cytosol, non-native RTA can uncouple from the ERAD pathway by virtue of its low lysine content (9Deeks E.D. Cook J.P. Day P.J. Smith D.C.

This would reduce the chance for polyubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation and thereby provide opportunities for refolding in a way that is not normally possible for terminally misfolded ERAD substrates whose dislocation is inextricably linked to degradation.

Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), ricin is only reduced by PDI (3Spooner R.A. Watson P.D. Marsden C.J. Smith D.C. Moore K.A. Cook J.P. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Bellisola G. Fracasso G. Ippoliti R. Menestrina G. Rosen A. Solda S. Udali S. Tomazzolli R. Tridente G. Colombatti M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 1721-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Other than the known RTA interactions with PDI and thioredoxin reductase (23Bellisola G. Fracasso G. Ippoliti R. Menestrina G. Rosen A. Solda S. Udali S. Tomazzolli R. Tridente G. Colombatti M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 1721-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), there is a reported nonglycan-mediated interaction of RTA with the ER degradation enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM) (24Slominska-Wojewodzka M. Gregers T.F. Walchli S. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1664-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and an interaction of ricin holotoxin with calreticulin that appears to facilitate toxin trafficking from the Golgi to the ER (25Day P.J. Owens S.R. Wesche J. Olsnes S. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7202-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Of course, ER chaperone interactions act downstream of any unfolding step because ricin presumably arrives by endocytosis to this compartment as a native protein. The question therefore arises: how is RTA perceived as a potential substrate for the ERAD/retrotranslocation machinery? Unlike the processed and reduced A1 chain of cholera toxin that is conformationally unstable at 37 °C in aqueous solution (26Pande A.H. Scaglione P. Taylor M. Nemec K.N. Tuthill S. Moe D. Holmes R.K. Tatulian S.A. Teter K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 1114-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), RTA at pH 7.0 does not become structurally unstable at temperatures below 42 °C. However, above this nonphysiological temperature, RTA can unfold noncooperatively to generate a molten globule (27Argent R.H. Parrott A.M. Day P.J. Roberts L.M. Stockley P.G. Lord J.M. Radford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9263-9269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Hence, at 37 °C, RTA must employ a different tack to be recognized as unfolded/misfolded by ER quality control systems. One possibility is that the hydrophobic C terminus of RTA (28Simpson J.C. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), newly exposed following reduction and dissociation of RTB (3Spooner R.A. Watson P.D. Marsden C.J. Smith D.C. Moore K.A. Cook J.P. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), may directly promote the kind of chaperone interaction that ultimately leads to membrane translocation. Alternatively, this region may trigger membrane lipid interactions in a process that induces specific or random structural change in the toxin. Indeed, a previous study has shown that upon mixing RTA with liposomes containing a negatively charged phospholipid (POPG), the toxin underwent major structural changes while bound to the bilayer and was rendered sensitive to protease (29Day P.J. Pinheiro T.J. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This suggestive result led us to examine the interaction of RTA with liposomes containing phosphatidylserine (POPS), a negatively charged lipid that, in contrast to POPG, is a significant component of biological membranes (30Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). In addition, because negatively charged lipids such as PS are synthesized on, and can be detected within, the cytosolic leaflet of the ER membrane (30Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 31Higgins J.A. Dawson R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 470: 342-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we have characterized RTA binding to the surface of intact canine pancreatic ER microsomes to assess RTA affinity for a natural membrane while precluding potential complications from lumenally exposed proteins that may interact with RTA. We show, using chromatography, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism, that RTA binds to such bilayers in a temperature-independent manner but that the physiologically relevant temperature of 37 °C is required for specific changes in toxin structure and exposure to the nonpolar lipid core. The implications of these findings for RTA retrotranslocation are discussed. Modification of RTA with NBD-RTA and RTA variants (RTA(C171A)259-NBD, RTA(E177D,C259S,I249C)249-NBD, and RTA(C171A,E177D); the following variants each contain K4R, C171A, E177D, and K239R mutations: RTA(R31K)31-NBD, RTA(E61K)61-NBD, RTA(Q98K)98-NBD, RTA(R114K)114-NBD, RTA(Q128K)128-NBD, and RTA(E135K)135-NBD) were created, expressed, and purified using published methods (9Deeks E.D. Cook J.P. Day P.J. Smith D.C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3405-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because this study focuses on NBD dyes attached to single residues within RTA, NBD-labeled RTA variants are designated RTA#-NBD, and # indicates the amino acid position to which NBD was attached. Cysteines in RTA259-NBD and RTA249-NBD were labeled with the thiol-reactive dye N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (IANBD; Molecular Probes), whereas lysines in RTA31-NBD, RTA61-NBD, RTA98-NBD, RTA114-NBD, RTA128-NBD, and RTA135-NBD were labeled with the amine-reactive dye succinimidyl 6-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoate (NBD-X; Molecular Probes). In a typical labeling reaction, 2-5 ml of an RTA variant (0.5-2 mg/ml) was thawed and dialyzed overnight against 2 L of labeling buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA). IANBD or NBD-X in Me2SO was then added to provide final concentrations of 4-10-fold molar excess of reagent over the RTA and a maximum of 5% (v/v) Me2SO. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the reaction was quenched for 1 h at 4 °C by the addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 10 mm (thiol-reactive probes) or freshly prepared hydroxylamine (pH 8.5) to a final concentration of 150 mm (amine-reactive probes). The mixture was then passed over a Sephadex G-50 gel filtration column (30 × 1.5-cm inner diameter) equilibrated in buffer H (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The fractions containing the NBD-labeled protein were pooled, sucrose was added to 0.25 m final concentration, and aliquots were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at -80 °C. The extent of covalent reaction with NBD was estimated using a molar extinction coefficient of 25,000 m-1 cm-1 for IANBD or 22,000 m -1 cm-1 for NBD-X (32Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products.9th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR2002Google Scholar). Preparation of Microsomes and Liposomes-Salt-washed rough microsomal membranes (KRMs) were prepared from dog pancreas as described previously (33Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). When KRMs needed to be further purified, a sample was layered on a sucrose step gradient and sedimented (Beckman SW55 rotor; 40,000 rpm; 2 h; 4 °C; ½ × 2 inch polyallomer centrifuge tube with 2 ml of 0.8 m sucrose and 2.5 ml of 2 m sucrose in buffer H). The purified KRMs were located at the 0.8-2 m sucrose interface. Liposomes were prepared as before (see supplemental material). To prepare KRMs for nitroxide quenching experiments, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(5-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (5NOPC; Avanti Polar Lipids) or POPC in chloroform was first dried under a stream of nitrogen and further dried under vacuum for an additional 3 h. The phospholipid film was then hydrated in buffer H by vortexing (final lipid concentration, 10 mm). Thereafter, lipid micelles were created by sonication for 30 min at 25 °C in a Bransonic 12 bath sonicator (Branson). Lipid micelles were mixed with an equal volume of microsome buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 200 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 250-400 eq KRMs and fused by incubation for 1 h at 25 °C. The nitroxide-labeled (5NOPC) and control (POPC) KRMs were further purified as described above. Membrane Binding Assays-RTA interactions with membranes were assayed nonspectroscopically using gel filtration chromatography, sedimentation, or alkaline extraction. KRMs (40 eq) were incubated with 2.5 μm RTA259-NBD in buffer H for 30 min at 4 or 26 °C, after which free RTA259-NBD was separated from KRM-bound protein by Sepharose CL-2B (8 × 0.5-cm inner diameter) gel filtration chromatography in buffer H at 4 °C. The fractions (350 μl) were scanned for the presence of RTA259-NBD by NBD emission (λex = 468 nm, λem = 530 nm) or for the presence of KRMs by performing right angle light scattering measurements (λex = 405 nm, λem = 420 nm). When unlabeled 7 μm RTA samples were used, the KRMs were replaced by liposomes (200 μm), the mixture was incubated in buffer C (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1) for 30 min at the indicated temperature, and RTA in gel filtration fractions was detected by intrinsic fluorescence (λex = 280 nm, λem = 322 nm). For sedimentation assays, KRMs (20 eq) were incubated with 250 nm RTA259-NBD in buffer H for 30 min at 4 °C or 26 °C. KRMs were collected by sedimentation through a 0.5 m sucrose cushion in buffer H (Beckman TLA100 rotor; 100,000 rpm; 5 min; 4 °C), washed, collected again, and finally resuspended in buffer H. Bovine serum albumin was added as carrier (final concentration, 0.2 mg/ml) to both the combined supernatants of both centrifugation steps and also the resuspended KRM pellet. The proteins were then precipitated with 12.5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The bands were visualized by NBD emission using a Pharos FX Plus fluorescence imager (Bio-Rad). For some experiments, microsomal or liposomal membranes were purified by sedimentation and then carbonate extracted (supplemental material) to assess the extent of protein integration into the lipid bilayer (34Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy-Steady-state fluorescence of NBD-labeled RTA samples was measured using an SLM 8100 photon-counting spectrofluorimeter as described previously (35Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). At low temperatures, the cuvette chamber was continuously flushed with N2 to prevent condensation of water on the microcells. The excitation wavelength (λex) for NBD was 468 nm, and the emission wavelength (λem) was 530 nm; the band-pass was 4 nm. Emission intensity was scanned at 1-nm intervals between 500 and 600 nm, and typically three to five spectra were averaged. The measurements were taken in four 4-mm quartz microcells that were coated with POPC vesicles to minimize protein adsorption (36Ye J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23016-23021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the indicated temperature. In all cases, the samples containing or lacking NBD-labeled proteins were examined in parallel, and the net NBD intensity was determined by subtracting the signal of an equivalent NBD-free sample prepared with unmodified RTA from the RTA#-NBD sample signal. The final RTA concentration was set to 450 nm in all samples using unlabeled RTA as necessary to reach that value. When excess KRMs or liposomes (determined by titration) were added to a sample in microcells, the contents were mixed thoroughly with a 2 × 2-mm magnetic stirring bar as described previously (37Dell V.A. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the resulting sample was incubated at the indicated temperature for 10 (KRMs) or 20 min (liposomes) before the intensity was measured again. Association of RTA#-NBD with KRMs or liposomes was detected by an increase in NBD emission intensity or anisotropy (r, measured as before) (38Johnson A.E. Adkins H.J. Matthews E.A. Cantor C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For samples that lacked NBD, tryptophan emission of 7 μm RTA samples was scanned using a 4-mm-path length cuvette in a Photon Technology International fluorimeter at 37 °C with 2-nm slit widths, 0.5-s integration time, and 1-nm step size. After the appropriate blank subtraction, four spectra were typically averaged. Quenching of NBD Emission Intensity by Spin-labeled Phospholipids-The emission spectra were obtained as above using λex = 468 nm and 1-nm intervals between 520 and 550 nm. The net NBD intensities at λem max were determined and normalized to account for differences in the NBD content in each sample. Thereafter, excess PCPS liposomes, either with or without NOPC, were added to parallel samples to a final concentration of 600 μm. When KRMs were used for the quenching experiments, 20 eq of KRMs containing either 5NOPC or POPC were added to each sample. After 20 min of incubation with the membranes at the indicated temperature, the emission spectra were recorded, and the net NBD intensities at λem max were determined and normalized using the membrane-free intensities. F0 was the net intensity of the nitroxide-free sample, and FNO was the net intensity of the sample containing NOPC after the signals of equivalent NBD-free samples prepared with unmodified RTA were subtracted from the NBD sample intensities. Circular Dichroism-Far-UV CD was measured on a Jasco J-715 spectrapolarimeter at 37 °C using a 1-mm-path length cuvette. Typically six spectra were recorded from 190 to 260 nm with 1-nm step size and averaged. The protein concentrations were 5 μm. The spectra were corrected for background by subtraction of appropriate blanks. Experimental Strategy-RTA, but not ricin holotoxin, interacts with negatively charged phospholipid vesicles (29Day P.J. Pinheiro T.J. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because RTA is released from RTB within the lumen of the ER, it is conceivable that RTA binds or even inserts into the ER membrane during its passage from the lumen to the cytosol. To examine membrane-protein interactions, we used a spectroscopic approach that has many advantages, including the ability to monitor those interactions in real time with intact membranes under native aqueous conditions and to selectively focus on one or more residues or domains in the protein while doing so (39Johnson A.E. Traffic. 2005; 6: 1078-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopy is particularly useful because the fluorescence signal can be analyzed using multiple independent techniques. A water-sensitive fluorescent dye was covalently attached to a single cysteine or lysine residue within RTA to monitor directly the environment of that residue. Each fluorescently labeled RTA was then incubated with either liposomal or purified microsomal ER membranes, and any changes in its spectral properties were characterized. NBD was chosen as the fluorescent probe because its emission properties change dramatically upon moving from an aqueous to a hydrophobic environment (35Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 40Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Moreover, NBD has a relatively small size for a dye, it is uncharged, it has sufficient polar character to be soluble in an aqueous milieu, and it is not so hydrophobic that it aggressively buries itself in the nonpolar interior of a membrane. Therefore, NBD is a minimally intrusive probe that acts as a sensitive and stable reporter group in both aqueous and nonaqueous environments. By using this experimental approach, many different structural and mechanistic aspects of protein-membrane interactions can be characterized using functional proteins and membranes in aqueous conditions that mimic the physiological (39Johnson A.E. Traffic. 2005; 6: 1078-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fluorescently Labeled RTA259-NBD-Wild type RTA contains two cysteine residues at positions 171 and 259. Only 8 amino acids from the C terminus of RTA, Cys259 forms the interchain disulfide bond that links RTA and RTB in the ricin holotoxin. Because this disulfide bond is cleaved after the holotoxin reaches the ER lumen, Cys259 of RTA will normally be reduced in the lumen. NBD was therefore reacted with Cys259 (Cys171 in native RTA does not react because it is deeply buried within the protein; data not shown). However, labeling at Cys171 was further prevented by converting this residue to an Ala (C171A) using site-directed mutagenesis of RTA cDNA. Replacement of Cys171 was shown previously to yield a catalytically active RTA protein with unaffected rRNA depurination and almost unaffected in vitro protein synthesis inhibition activity (5Argent R.H. Roberts L.M. Wales R. Robertus J.D. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26705-26710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After purification of the overexpressed recombinant RTAC171A protein, NBD reacted covalently with more than 60% of the Cys259, and further purification yielded the NBD-labeled RTA sample we designated RTA259-NBD. RTA259-NBD Binds to Microsomal ER Membranes-Day et al. (29Day P.J. Pinheiro T.J. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that RTA binds to liposomes containing negatively charged phospholipids, but RTA binding to natural membranes has not been examined. We therefore investigated whether RTA binds to purified KRMs. Although ricin is exposed first to the lumenal leaflet of the ER membrane after endocytosis, we chose to examine the binding of RTA to the outer surface of ER microsomes because the cytoplasmic leaflet is always exposed in the sealed vesicles. This approach allowed us to focus on RTA with genuine bilayer lipids (including cytoplasmically exposed phosphatidylserine) in the absence of lumenal proteins that might interact with or intercept RTA to complicate interpretation. After incubation of RTA259-NBD with KRMs at 0 or 26 °C, membrane-bound RTA was separated from free protein either by sedimentation or by gel filtration. KRM-exposed RTA259-NBD was found in the pellet following ultracentrifugation, whereas RTA259-NBD remained in the supernatant in the absence of membranes (Fig. 1A). Also, when a sample of RTA259-NBD and KRMs was analyzed by gel filtration, the RTA co-eluted with KRMs in the void volume of the column, whereas KRM-free RTA259-NBD eluted in later fractions (Fig. 1B). Thus, both sedimentation and gel filtration assays demonstrated that RTA259-NBD binds to microsomal membranes with significant affinity. Moreover, this binding occurs at both 0 and 26 °C. To determine whether RTA259-NBD binding to KRMs can be detected spectroscopically, the membrane dependence of both NBD anisotropy and emission intensity was measured. After determining the anisotropy of free RTA259C-NBD, KRMs were added at either 4 °C or 37 °C. The resulting increases in anisotropy (Fig. 2A) showed that the slowly rotating microsomes significantly slowed the rotational rate of the protein and its NBD, thereby demonstrating that RTA259-NBD bound to the KRMs at both 4 and 37 °C. No change in the NBD emission spectrum of RTA259-NBD was observed when KRMs were added to the protein at 4 °C (Fig. 2B). However, upon RTA259-NBD incubation with KRMs at 37 °C, a substantial increase in fluorescence intensity was observed and also a significant blue shift in the wavelength of maximum emission intensity (λem max) (Fig. 2B). Thus, the NBD at residue 259 moved from an aqueous environment to a more hydrophobic milieu when RTA was exposed to microsomal membranes at 37 °C. The NBD Emission Spectrum of Membrane-bound RTA259-NBD Is Temperature-dependent-To determine at which temperature the NBD environment of membrane-exposed RTA changes, we compared the emission spectra of free RTA with those of membrane-bound RTA as a function of temperature. When incubated without KRMs, the fluorescence intensity of RTA259-NBD declined with increasing temperature (Fig. 3A) because of the reduced quantum yield of the NBD dye at higher temperatures. In the presence of membranes, the same effect was observed until the temperature reached 30 °C. However, when the temperature was further increased to 37 °C, a substantial increase in RTA259-NBD fluorescence intensity was observed, as well as a significant blue shift in λem max (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, a relatively small increase in temperature from 30 to 37 °C caused a dramatic spectral change and hence a highly temperature-dependent transition from an aqueous to a hydrophobic environment for the NBD dye at the C terminus of RTA. To determine whether this change in RTA environment originated from a phase change in the lipid bilayer, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene was incorporated into"

Williams argue that such research is both morally defensible and important for the pursuit of truth. In the first , Steven Rose argues that studies investigating possible links between race, gender and intelligence do no good. The second of Nature's three Darwin 200 special issues celebrates 'everybody's Darwin' — the great man's legacy in the context of the human condition. The sequencing of the human genome and those of our animal relatives has broadened our understanding of the evolution of our species and the unity of the living word. Genomics has identified many sequences that are under selection, but they do not provide the simple read-out of human evolutionary history that some expected. Erika Check Hayden talks to geneticists who are coming to realize that they cannot interpret these sequences without considering the impact of human culture. Donald Brown's 1991 book Human Universals concentrated on what human societies have in common — in areas such as language, status systems and social taboos. Evolutionary psychologists have warmed to the theme, and in a field not without controversy, their attempts to understand the balance between human universals and individual and societal uniqueness are generating some fascinating ideas, as Dan Jones reports. More controversy in Commentary, on 'untouchable science'. The protagonists — Steven Rose in one corner, Stephen Ceci and Wendy Williams in the other — explain why research on the genetics of race and gender should — or should not — be pursued without restriction.

Bynum reviews Darwin's Sacred Cause, in which Adrian Desmond and James Moore reinterpret Darwin's life and work based on two well known facts about him: he felt physical revulsion when confronted by cruelty and he loathed slavery.

https://openalex.org/W2041650071,"Decorin, an archetypal member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan gene family, regulates collagen fibrillogenesis and cell growth. To further explore its biological function, we examined the role of Decorin during zebrafish development. Zebrafish Decorin is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that exhibits a high degree of conservation with its mammalian counterpart and displays a unique spatiotemporal expression pattern. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of zebrafish decorin identified a developmental role during medial-lateral convergence and anterior-posterior extension of the body plan, as well as in craniofacial cartilage formation. decorin morphants displayed a pronounced shortening of the head-to-tail axis as well as compression, flattening, and extension of the jaw cartilages. The morphant phenotype was efficiently rescued by zebrafish decorin mRNA. Unexpectedly, microinjection of excess zebrafish decorin mRNA or proteoglycan/protein core into one-cell stage embryos caused cyclopia. The morphant and overexpression phenotype represent a convergent extension defect. Our results indicate a central function for Decorin during early embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2073276804,"Background Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) have been isolated from neurogenic regions of the adult brain. Reportedly, these cells can be expanded in vitro under prolonged mitogen stimulation without propensity to transform. However, the constitutive activation of the cellular machinery required to bypass apoptosis and senescence places these cells at risk for malignant transformation. Methodology/Principal Findings Using serum-free medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), we established clonally derived NS/progenitor cell (NS/PC) cultures from the olfactory bulb (OB) of five adult patients. The NS/PC cultures obtained from one OB specimen lost growth factor dependence and neuronal differentiation at early passage. These cells developed glioblastoma tumors upon xenografting in immunosuppressed mice. The remaining NS/PC cultures were propagated either as floating neurospheres or as adherent monolayers with mainteinance of growth factor dependence and multipotentiality at late passage. These cells were engrafted onto the CNS of immunosuppressed rodents. Overall, the grafted NS/PCs homed in the host parenchyma showing ramified morphology and neuronal marker expression. However, a group of animals transplanted with NS/PCs obtained from an adherent culture developed fast growing tumors histologically resembling neuroesthesioblastoma. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses showed that the NS/PC undergo chromosomal changes with repeated in vitro passages under mitogen stimulation, and that up-regulation of hTERT and NOTCH1 associates with in vivo tumorigenicity. Conclusions/Significance Using culturing techniques described in current literature, NS/PCs arise from the OB of adult patients which in vivo either integrate in the CNS parenchyma showing neuron-like features or initiate tumor formation. Extensive xenografting studies on each human derived NS cell line appear mandatory before any use of these cells in the clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2043784485,"The Vaccinia virus H1 gene product, VH1, is a dual specificity phosphatase that down-regulates the cellular antiviral response by dephosphorylating STAT1. The crystal structure of VH1, determined at 1.32 A resolution, reveals a novel dimeric quaternary structure, which exposes two active sites spaced approximately 39 A away from each other. VH1 forms a stable dimer via an extensive domain swap of the N-terminal helix (residues 1-20). In vitro, VH1 can dephosphorylate activated STAT1, in a reaction that is competed by the nuclear transport adapter importin alpha5. Interestingly, VH1 is inactive with respect to STAT1 bound to DNA, suggesting that the viral phosphatase acts predominantly on the cytoplasmic pool of activated STAT1. We propose that the dimeric quaternary structure of VH1 is essential for specific recognition of activated STAT1, which prevents its nuclear translocation, thus blocking interferon-gamma signal transduction and antiviral response."
https://openalex.org/W2056926111,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the capacity to invade lung epithelial cells by co-opting the intrinsic endocytic properties of lipid rafts, which are rich in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and proteins, such as caveolin-1 and -2. We compared intratracheal Pseudomonas infection in wild type and caveolin-deficient mice to investigate the role of caveolin proteins in the pathogenesis of Pseudomonas pneumonia. Unlike wild type mice, which succumb to pneumonia, caveolin-deficient mice are resistant to Pseudomonas. We observed that Pseudomonas invasion of lung epithelial cells is dependent on caveolin-2 but not caveolin-1. Phosphorylation of caveolin-2 by Src family kinases is an essential event for Pseudomonas invasion. Our studies also reveal the existence of a distinct signaling mechanism in lung epithelial cells mediated by COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk) that negatively regulates Pseudomonas invasion. Csk migrates to lipid raft domains, where it decreases phosphorylation of caveolin-2 by inactivating c-Src. Whereas Pseudomonas co-opts the endocytic properties of caveolin-2 for invasion, there also exists in these cells an intrinsic Csk-dependent cellular defense mechanism aimed at impairing this activity. The success of Pseudomonas in co-opting lipid raft-mediated endocytosis to invade lung epithelial cells may depend on the relative strengths of these counteracting signaling activities. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the capacity to invade lung epithelial cells by co-opting the intrinsic endocytic properties of lipid rafts, which are rich in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and proteins, such as caveolin-1 and -2.

We observed that Pseudomonas invasion of lung epithelial cells is dependent on caveolin-2 but not caveolin-1. Phosphorylation of caveolin-2 by Src family kinases is an essential event for Pseudomonas invasion. Our studies also reveal the existence of a distinct signaling mechanism in lung epithelial cells mediated by COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk) that negatively regulates Pseudomonas invasion. Csk migrates to lipid raft domains, where it decreases phosphorylation of caveolin-2 by inactivating c-Src. Whereas Pseudomonas co-opts the endocytic properties of caveolin-2 for invasion, there also exists in these cells an intrinsic Csk-dependent cellular defense mechanism aimed at impairing this activity. The success of Pseudomonas in co-opting lipid raft-mediated endocytosis to invade lung epithelial cells may depend on the relative strengths of these counteracting signaling activities.

Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the morbidity and mortality associated with Pa pneumonia remains high, at least partly due to the ability of Pa to resist antibiotic-mediated killing (1Fagon J.Y.

It has recently been recognized that Pa is not solely an extracellular pathogen and that Pa can invade lung epithelial cells (LECs) via lipid raft-mediated endocytosis (6Zaas D.W. Duncan M.J. Li G.

Caveolin-1 has been implicated as a scaffolding protein for organizing and concentrating caveolin-interacting signaling molecules within caveolae. Caveolin-2 is the most divergent of the caveolin gene family, with only ∼50% similarity to caveolin-1 (15Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Caveolin-2 interacts with caveolin-1 to form a hetero-oligomeric complex within lipid rafts (14Mora R. Bonilha V.L.

In order for caveolin-2 to be expressed, caveolin-1 serves as a chaperone to transport caveolin-2 to the plasma membrane. In the absence of caveolin-1, caveolin-2 is degraded in the Golgi apparatus, and no significant caveolin-2 is expressed (14Mora R. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A. Scherer P.E. Brown D. Lisanti M.P.

As expected based on these observations, the caveolin-1 knock-out mouse lacks expression of both caveolin-1 and -2 and is functionally deficient in both caveolin-1 and -2 (16Razani B. Engelman J.A.

The primary aim of this study is to investigate the role of caveolin proteins in the pathogenesis of Pa pneumonia. We have hypothesized that Pa invasion of LECs is an important virulence factor for Pa in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. The ability of Pa to invade LECs allows for a protected intracellular niche where Pa may be able to replicate and avoid innate host defense mechanisms. In this study, we show that caveolin-deficient mice are less susceptible to Pa pneumonia due to the inability of Pa to invade LECs. The lipid raft-mediated uptake of Pa requires the phosphorylation of caveolin-2 by the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Surprisingly, we also observed that knocking down of the COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk) resulted in a 4-fold increase in the invasion of Pa into LECs, revealing the existence of a host cell-mediated response directed at limiting invasion of Pa. Following exposure to Pa, Csk was found to migrate to lipid raft fractions of LECs and to inhibit phosphorylation of caveolin-2. The importance of Csk in negatively regulating caveolin-2 and lipid raft-mediated Pa uptake may provide valuable clues for the development of novel therapies aimed at abrogating Pa pneumonia in high risk patients. Animals-Breeding pairs of caveolin-1 knock-out (cav-/-) mice (Cavtm1Mls/J) and control (cav+/+) mice (B6129SF2/J) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. Mice were housed and bred in pathogen-free facilities at Duke University and handled according to approved IACUC protocols. Bacterial Strains and Cell Lines-Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 27853, and PAO-1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Strain S4270 is a clinical isolate that was obtained from the Duke clinical microbiology laboratory. P. aeruginosa strains were grown in 5 ml of static LB broth for 18 h. Staphylococcus aureus was grown for 18 h in 5 ml of brain heart infusion broth (BD Biosciences). After static incubation for 18 h, bacterial cultures were diluted 1:50 and placed on a shaker at 37 °C for 2-3 h until they reached midlog growth phase with an A600 of 0.4-0.8. GFP-expressing strains of Pa were created using pSMC2-GFP vector provided by George O’Toole (Dartmouth) (25Bloemberg G.V. O'Toole G.A. Lugtenberg B.J. Kolter R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4543-4551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pa was made competent using a magnesium competency protocol and were transfected with the pSMC2-GFP vector (26Mercer A.A. Loutit J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 37-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Murine Model of Pa Pneumonia-The cav-/- and cav+/+ mice were infected with bacteria via direct transtracheal instillation. Mice were sedated with ketamine and xylizine, and a surgical incision was made in the neck to directly expose the trachea. Approximately 107 cfu of Pa (ATCC 27853) diluted in 50 μl of Hanks’ buffered saline solution was instilled into the trachea via a 30-gauge needle. The incision was closed with a suture, and the mice were monitored over the next 10 days. Any mice that were moribund were sacrificed using CO2 inhalation. A total 7 mice/group were used for each of the three experimental replicates that were performed for the survival analysis. For secondary endpoints, mice were sacrificed at 16 h by a lethal overdose of pentobarbital. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed with three serial 1-ml lavages. The lung was removed and fixed in formalin for histological analysis. Additional lung tissue was homogenized in sterile PBS, and serial dilutions were plated to obtain data on bacterial burden measured by colony forming units. Quantitative analysis was carried out to determine the relative extent of lung consolidation by pneumonia. The lungs were all inflated to a constant pressure of 25 mm Hg. The area of lung tissue was calculated out using ImageJ software (version 1.40g). For each slide (representing one mouse), seven nonoverlapping images were taken randomly at ×20 magnification. The total alveolar tissue area was determined using thresholding, and the final volume of the tissue in all seven fields was averaged. The data were expressed as mean percentage of the total field ± S.E. The final volume of the tissue in all seven fields was averaged, and the data were expressed as mean percentage of the total field ± S.E. Isolation of Primary Cells-Murine tracheal epithelial cells from both cav+/+ and cav-/- were isolated as described previously (27Davidson D.J. Gray M.A. Kilanowski F.M. Tarran R. Randell S.H.

Physiol. 2002; 283: L1315-L1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and were grown on transwells with an air-liquid interface. In addition, primary alveolar macrophages were isolated according to our previously published protocols (29Restrepo C.I. Dong Q. Savov J. Mariencheck W.I. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cytospins of lavages stained with the Hemacolor stain kit revealed macrophage populations greater than 95% of total cells. The isolated primary cells were then infected with 105 cfu of Pa ATCC 27853 diluted in 100 μl of serum-free medium. A gentamicin protection assay was performed as described below to quantify the number of intracellular bacteria within the primary tracheal epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. Cell Lines and Constructs-The murine lung epithelial cell line, MLE-12, was graciously provided by Landon King (The Johns Hopkins University) and was grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2.0 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.3 g/liter l-glutamine, 2.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. RNA interference vectors were generated using pQCXIN retroviral vector (BD Biosciences). Briefly, pQCXIN was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and then was ligated to generate pQCXIN1. Human U6 small nuclear RNA promoter was PCR-amplified from pTZ U6 + 1 (a gift from John Rossi, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA) with an added BglII site (5′-ends) and BamHI and XbaI sites (3′-ends). The following oligonucleotides were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA): 5′-GAT CCG CTG AGC ATT GAT GAG GAG TTC AAG AGA CTC CTC ATC AAT GCT CAGC TTT TTT-3′ and 5′-CTA GAA AAA AGC TGA GCA TTG ATG AGG AGT CTC TTG AAC TCC TCA ATG CTC AGC G-3′ to generate pQC-Csk. Control vectors were created using a nonsense sequence to create the pQC-LUC cell line as a control. 5′-GAT CCG TAC GCG GAA TAC TTC GAA TTC AAG AGA TTC GAA GTA TTC CGC GTA CTT TTT T-3′ and 5′-CTA GAA AAA AGT ACG CGG AAT ACT TCG AAT CTC TTG AAT TCG AAG TAT TCC GCG TAC G-3′ correspond to nucleotides 423-441 of the firefly luciferase in the pGL2-control vector. GenBank™ accession number X65324 was used to generate the control cell line pQC-LUC. The Amphopack-293 cell line (BD Biosciences) was used to produce the viral particles. The 3×FLAG fragment from p3×FLAg-CMV-10 (Sigma) was PCR-amplified using FLAGF (5′-CCG GGA TCC ACG GGC TGA CTA CAA AGA CCA TGA CGG TGA T-3′) and FLAGR (5′-TTC GCG GCC GCT CAC TAC TTG TCA TCG TCA TCC TTG TA-3′). pLEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was then ligated with the 3×FLAG fragment to generate pFLAG-N1. The caveolin-1 gene was PCR-amplified using Cav1F (5′-GAT CTC GAG ATG TCT GGG GGC AAA TAC GT-3′) and Cav1R (5′-GAT GGA TCC CGT ATC TCT TTC TGC GTG CTG ATG-3′) to generate pCav1-FLAG. The caveolin-2 gene was PCR-amplified using 2F (5′-CTC AGA TCT CAT GGG GCT GGA GAC CGA GAA G-3′) and Cav2R (5′-GAT AAG CTT GTC GTG GCT CAG TTG CAT GCT-3′) to generate pCav2-FLAG. All constructs were sequenced to confirm sequence accuracy and in-frame of translation. Gentamicin Protection Assays-MLE-12 cells were grown to ∼80% confluence for all experiments. For infections with strains of P. aeruginosa, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 300-600 bacteria/host cell by the addition of 100 μl of bacteria diluted in serum-free cell culture medium containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing 50 μg/ml of the membrane-impermeable antibiotic gentamicin (Invitrogen) to kill extracellular bacteria and incubated for 45 min. Each well was washed three times with PBS. In order to remove and lyse the cells, 30 μl of 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) was added to each well for 5 min, and 70 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS was then added. Cells were scraped and transferred to 0.65-ml tubes, and each well was washed with an additional 100 μl of Triton that was also transferred to the tubes. The cell lysates were diluted and plated onto agar plates where colonies were counted to quantify the number of intracellular bacteria. To test the effect of pretreatment by specific lipid raft disrupters/usurpers on bacterial invasion, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD; 3 mm; Sigma) in serum-free medium was added to the cells for 30 min and then washed off prior to infection. To test the effect of altering tyrosine phosphorylation on bacterial invasion, the cells were pretreated with genistein (100 μg/ml; Sigma) for 30 min prior to infection and throughout the period of infection. After the preincubation step, the cells were washed, and the medium was replaced with bacteria in serum-free medium with or without the agent being tested as required. The data shown represent a combination of three separate experiments for each of the bacterial invasion studies. The viability of the cells was not affected by any of the drug treatments used as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Confocal Microscopy-MLE-12 cells were seeded onto collagen-coated 12-mm diameter glass coverslips placed into the wells of a 24-well plate and grown for 36 h. The cells were infected with ATCC 27853 strain of P. aeruginosa expressing GFP (25Bloemberg G.V. O'Toole G.A. Lugtenberg B.J. Kolter R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4543-4551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, washed four times with PBS (Invitrogen) to remove unbound bacteria, and fixed overnight in 2.0% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After removing the fixative, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Csk was then labeled using polyclonal anti-Csk antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and Alexa-fluor 660 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Frozen sections of murine lungs infected with GFP-expressing Pa were also examined with a confocal microscopy to identify the localization of Pa infection in vivo. Lung sections were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and stained with CellMask deep red plasma membrane stain (Invitrogen). Coverslips were examined using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation-The following antibodies were used: anti-rabbit polyclonal caveolin-2 (Abcam), anti-mouse monoclonal caveolin-2 (BD Biosciences), anti-mouse monoclonal FLAG antibody (Sigma), anti-rabbit polyclonal Csk (BD Biosciences), anti-mouse Csk (BD Biosciences), anti-rabbit c-Src (eBiosciences), anti-mouse c-Src clone GD11 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-rabbit src529PY (BIOSOURCE), and anti-rabbit tyrosine phosphorylation (BD Biosciences). Cells were grown in a 6-well plate to greater than 90% confluence. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1:10; Upstate Biotechnology), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and protease inhibitor mixture (1:100; Sigma). Cell lysates were normalized for protein and volume. Samples were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The proteins were detected using the Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent kit (Pierce). Csk, c-Src, and FLAG-caveolin-2 were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates of MLE-12 cells as follows. MLE-12 cells were grown to 90% confluence in 6-well plates. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS. The cells were then lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology; 1:10), n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (60 mm; Sigma), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), protease inhibitor, phosphatase mixture (Sigma; 1:100)). The sample was precleared with 30 μl of a 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of a 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose in PBS plus the indicated primary antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS and resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were assayed by Western blotting as described above, and all experimental results were replicated in at least three separate experiments. Statistics-Data were compiled and analyzed using Microsoft Excel® and Graphpad® Prism software. Data for gentamicin protection assays are reported as a mean of at least three experiments with error bars set as S.E. Significance was calculated using a two-tailed t test or analysis of variance for multiple comparisons with significance defined as a p value of less than 0.05 (indicated by asterisks). Survival curves were analyzed using Kaplan Meir survival curves and log rank test in Graph Pad® Prism 3.0. Caveolin-deficient Mice (cav-/-) Have Lower Mortality after Intratracheal Infection with Pa-Direct intratracheal instillation of Pa was selected as a murine model of acute bacterial pneumonia. Both caveolin-deficient (cav-/-) and wild type (cav+/+) strains of mice were infected with 107 cfu of Pa (ATCC strain 27853) via direct intratracheal instillation and observed over 10 days. The cav+/+ rapidly succumbed to Pa pneumonia with 25% mortality within 24 h and 100% mortality by 48 h (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the cav-/- mice were profoundly resistant and showed significantly greater survival than cav+/+ controls (hazard ratio 2.903, log rank p value <0.0001). None of the cav-/- mice had died during the first 24 h, and any deaths occurred later than cav+/+ controls. The surviving mice were monitored over 10 days, and the remaining cav-/- mice not only survived but also fully cleared the bacterial infection. The surviving mice were sacrificed at day 10, and cultures of BAL and lung homogenates revealed no growth of Pa. Lungs of cav-/- Mice Have Significantly Lower Bacterial Burden after Intratracheal Instillation of Pa-In order to analyze the early response to Pa pneumonia, both groups of mice were infected again with 107 cfu of Pa and sacrificed prior to any mortality at 16 h after infection. CFU analysis from mice sacrificed 30 min after infection confirmed that the same amount of bacteria was delivered to the lungs of both groups (data not shown). Mice underwent BAL as well as the removal of lungs, liver, and spleen to quantify bacterial burden. cav-/- mice had significantly lower levels of Pa in both the BAL fluid (Fig. 1B; p = 0.0067) and the lung tissue (Fig. 1C; p = 0.0022). Both groups of mice showed signs of systemic bacteremia with dissemination of Pa to the liver (Fig. 1D) and spleen (Fig. 1E), but there was no difference between the two groups. cav-/- Mice Have Less Lung Injury and Lower Levels of Inflammatory Cytokines in the Response to Pa Infection-The BAL total cell counts with differentials and cytokine responses were compared after Pa infection or saline-instilled controls. At base line, we found no differences in the BAL cell counts or levels of inflammatory cytokines between cav+/+ and cav-/- mice. The BAL cell counts in both cav-/- and cav+/+ mice were >90% neutrophils at 16 h after Pa infection (data not shown). The cav-/- mice had lower total cell counts and a lower number of neutrophils compared with cav+/+ mice (Fig. 1F; p = 0.16), revealing a trend toward a lower level inflammatory response. Cytokine measurements in BAL fluid also demonstrated lower levels of inflammation in the cav-/- mice compared with cav+/+ controls. BAL fluid collected 16 h after Pa infection demonstrated that the cav-/- mice had significantly lower levels of MIP-2 (Fig. 1G; p = 0.039), IL-1β (Fig. 1H; p = 0.0001), and tumor necrosis factor-α (Fig. 1I; p = 0.016). Base-line lung histology examined prior to infection showed no difference in lung architecture and morphology between the cav-/- and cav+/+ mice at 6-8 weeks of age (data not shown). Although these findings contrast previous published results (16Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G. Di Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38121-38138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), it is probably due to the young age of the mice used in this study compared with the prior descriptions. Four hours after Pa infection, lung histopathology demonstrated recruitment of neutrophils into the lung parenchyma with airway inflammation and minimal alveolar filling. However, we did not observe any differences between the cav-/- or cav+/+ groups (data not shown). However, by 16 h after infection, there was a striking difference with less lung injury in the cav -/-mice versus the cav+/+ mice (Fig. 2). Although both groups of mice displayed evidence of pneumonia with inflammatory cell infiltration, the amount of consolidation and number of inflammatory cells were markedly greater in the cav+/+ controls. Although the lungs of the cav+/+ mice revealed dense inflammatory infiltrates with areas of complete destruction of lung architecture, the cav-/- lungs showed fewer inflammatory cells, decreased lung injury, and preserved alveolar spaces. In order to quantify some of the histologic changes that were observed, we calculated the percentage of aerated and consolidated lungs in both groups of mice. Lungs from cav-/- mice had significantly less consolidation and a greater proportion of aerated lung compared with cav+/+ mice. cav-/- mice were found to have 44% of the area consolidated compared with 55% consolidation of the lung from cav+/+ mice (p = 0.012). The lower degree of histologic lung injury, lower BAL cell counts, and decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines parallel the significantly decreased bacterial burden within the lungs. Pa Invasion Is Inhibited in Primary LECs Isolated from cav-/- Mice-We hypothesize that the ability of Pa to persist within the lung is due, at least in part, to their ability to invade the LECs and thereby avoid host defense mechanisms. cav+/+ and cav-/- mice were intratracheally infected with GFP-expressing Pa. Confocal images of murine lungs showed a significant number of Pa that are co-localized with the alveolar epithelium (Fig. 3A) and appeared to be more common in the cav+/+ compared with the cav-/- mice. In order to quantify the ability of Pa to invade LECs, we compared the ability of Pa to invade cultured primary tracheal epithelial cells in vitro. Isolation of primary murine tracheal epithelial cells from both the cav-/- and cav+/+ mice was performed using established techniques (27Davidson D.J. Gray M.A. Kil"
https://openalex.org/W2015901429,"Posttranslational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a major regulator of transcription. We previously showed that progesterone receptors (PR) have a single consensus ψKXE SUMO-conjugation motif centered at Lys-388 in the N-terminal domain of PR-B and a homologous site of PR-A. SUMOylation of the PR is hormone-dependent and has a suppressive effect on transcription of an exogenous promoter. Here we show that repression of PR activity by SUMOylation at Lys-388 is uncoupled from phosphorylation, involves synergy between tandem progesterone response elements, and is associated with lowered ligand sensitivity and slowed ligand-dependent down-regulation. However, paradoxically, cellular overexpression of SUMO-1 increases PR transcriptional activity even if Lys-388 is mutated, suggesting that the receptors are activated indirectly by other SUMOylated proteins. One of these is the coactivator SRC-1, whose binding to PR and enhancement of agonist-dependent N-/C-terminal interactions is augmented by the presence of SUMO-1. Increased transcription due to SRC-1 is independent of PR SUMOylation based on assays with the Lys-388 mutants and the pure antiprogestin ZK98299, which blocks N-/C-terminal interactions. In summary, SUMOylation tightly regulates the transcriptional activity of PR by repressing the receptors directly while activating them indirectly through augmented SRC-1 coactivation.

However, for the most part, the two receptors regulate distinct, nonoverlapping genes and functions that are tissue-, cell-, and promoter-specific. PR-C lack the entire N terminus and first DBD zinc finger and cannot bind DNA (1Wei L.L. Gonzalez-Aller C. Wood W.M. Miller L.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol.

PR-A and PR-B are transactivators that can be tethered to DNA through other transcription factors, including SP-1 (11Owen G.I. Richer J.K. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol.

Compound PREs on exogenous promoters reportedly generate synergistic patterns of responses to PR, in which the total exceeds the sum of responses at single PREs (16Tung L. Abdel-Hafiz H. Shen T.

DNA-bound PR interact with multiple transcriptional coregulators and with the basal transcriptional machinery (17Shibata H. Spencer T.E. Onate S.A. Jenster G. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O’Malley B.W.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8036-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Coactivator-mediated synergy is due to intensified intramolecular binding between the N- and C-terminal domains of receptors. For example, TIF-2 binds both the N- and C-terminal AFs of estrogen receptors (ER). Indirect N-/C-terminal interactions are similarly facilitated by bridging factors for other steroid receptors. These include SRC-1, SRC-2, JDP-2, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP)/p300 for PR (19Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3008-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In sum, transcriptional synergy is highly complex and coactivator-driven and requires interaction among AFs within N and C termini of receptors, cooperative interactions among tandem receptors on compound DNA response elements, and recruitment and stabilization of multiprotein complexes on DNA (30Tsai M.J. O’Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar, 31Sathya G. Yi P. Bhagat S. Bambara R.A. Hilf R. Muyan M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 192: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A growing list of transcription factors are modified by conjugation to the 97-amino acid ubiquitin-like modifier, SUMO. SUMO-1 is covalently attached by a series of enzymatic reactions to lysine residues embedded in a consensus sequence, ΨKXE (where Ψ is a large hydrophobic amino acid) of client proteins. Unlike ubiquitin, which stably attaches to proteins in multimeric chains, SUMO-1 attaches to proteins as a monomer in a dynamic, reversible process. SUMOylation influences varied processes, including protein stability, activity, cellular localization, and interactions with other proteins (32Gill G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). It tends to repress transcription; hence, disruption of SUMO acceptor Lys residues generally increases activity (33Bies J.

A. 2003; 100: 15758-15763Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Most but not all steroid receptors (the exception appearing to be ER) are targets of SUMOylation in the N-terminal AF-1 domain, a covalent modification that suppresses their transcriptional activity by preventing cooperativity at complex promoters. Mineralocorticoid receptors are SUMOylated at four acceptor sites clustered around AF-1. Their mutation allows mineralocorticoid receptors to synergistically activate a compound promoter but not the single palindromic PRE of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (38Tirard M. Almeida O.F. Hutzler P. Melchior F. Michaelidis T.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 268: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GR are modified by SUMO-1 in vivo (39Le Drean Y. Mincheneau N. Le Goff P. Michel D. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and contain three consensus SUMO attachment sites, two in the N terminus at Lys-277 and Lys-293 in AF-1 and one in the LBD at Lys-703 (40Tian S. Poukka H. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The LBD site only marginally influences GR SUMOylation in COS cells and has no effect on overall GR SUMOylation in HeLa cells. Mutation of the N-terminal sites, the major SUMO acceptors, enhances ligand-dependent GR transcription on multiple PREs but not on mouse mammary tumor virus (41Holmstrom S.R. Chupreta S. So A.Y. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 2061-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutation of a related “synergy control” motif identified by Inñiguez-Lluhi et al. (42Inñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), located at GR Lys-297 and Lys-313, overlaps with the consensus SUMO attachment sites and disrupts SUMOylation. The isolated motifs inhibit GR transcription in trans at compound DNA binding sites. The large N terminus of AR is SUMOylated in a ligand-dependent manner at Lys-385 and Lys-511 (43Callewaert L. Verrijdt G. Haelens A. Claessens F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mutation of Lys-385, the major functional site, increases AR-dependent transcription from multiple hormone response elements. Thus, as in the case for mineralocorticoid receptors and GR, SUMOylation of AR suppresses their ability to synergize on compound promoters. Whether ER are targets of SUMOylation remains unclear. Although the other steroid receptors contain clearly identifiable ΨKXE SUMO acceptor sites, neither ERα nor ERβ have sequences matching this consensus (44Poukka H. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that phylogenetic and sequence alignments show that GR, mineralocorticoid receptors, AR, and PR belong to a subfamily of steroid receptors characterized by much larger N termini (ranging from 420 to 602 amino acids) than the N termini of ERα or ERβ (184 and 148 amino acids, respectively) (45Bledsoe R.K. Montana V.G. Stanley T.B. Delves C.J. Apolito C.J. McKee D.D. Consler T.G. Parks D.J. Stewart E.L. Willson T.M. Lambert M.H. Moore J.T. Pearce K.H. Xu H.E.

Indeed, Poukka et al. (44Poukka H. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) show that in vitro translated AR and GR, but not ERα or ERβ, are SUMOylated in the presence of the conjugating enzyme, Ubc9. Nevertheless, a recent study reported SUMOylation of ERα at hinge region Lys-266 and Lys-268. These and other hinge region mutants impaired, rather than activated, ER-driven transcription, effects of SUMOylation opposite to those observed with the large steroid receptors and other transcription factors (47Sentis S. Le Romancer M. Bianchin C. Rostan M.C. Corbo L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2671-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We have shown that PR SUMOylation maps to Lys-388 in the single SUMO attachment consensus site of PR-B and a related site of PR-A in the N terminus adjacent to AF-1. SUMO-1 attached to PR covalently at this site in a ligand- and LBD-dependent manner (48Abdel-Hafiz H. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33950-33956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). PR-C lack an N terminus and would not be SUMOylated. Like the other large steroid receptors, a single-point mutation of PR at Lys-388 increases transcriptional activity 5–10-fold over that of their wild-type counterparts on multimerized PREs but not on mouse mammary tumor virus. Daniel et al. (49Daniel A.R. Faivre E.J. Lange C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 2890-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) recently reported that PR SUMOylation at Lys-388 is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of Ser-294 in response to mitogenic signaling. In sum, SUMOylation of steroid receptors suppresses their synergistic transcriptional activity on compound promoters. The present studies address mechanisms for suppression of transcriptional synergy by PR SUMOylation, focusing on effects of this covalent modification on ligand sensitivity, ligand-dependent receptor down-regulation, and N-/C-terminal interactions and the role of the coactivator SRC-1. We find that SUMOylation targets each of these steps. Plasmids-The expression plasmids pSG5 hPR1 and pSG5 hPR2, encoding human PR-B and PR-A, respectively, were a gift of P.

In this system, full-length PR-B, the PR-B N terminus (amino acids 1–555), and PR mutants were subcloned into the pVP16 vector and expressed as VP16 activation domain fusion proteins. The hinge-LBD was subcloned into the pM vector and expressed as a fusion protein with the DNA binding domain of Gal-4. Gal4-SRC-1 and VP16-SRC-1 were gifts of B. O’Malley (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). HeLa cells were transfected with a combination of the pM and pVP16AD fusion constructs together with the Gal4-luciferase reporter and 20 ng of Renilla-luciferase vector for normalization, using calcium phosphate.

SUMOylation Slows Ligand-dependent PR Down-regulation-Mutation of Lys-388 in the PR N terminus augments transcriptional activity of the receptors (48Abdel-Hafiz H. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B.

Ligand-dependent down-regulation of PR is required for transcriptional activity (50Lange C.A. Shen T. Horwitz K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine whether there is a link between PR SUMOylation and ligand-dependent down-regulation, ER+, PR–T47D-Y human breast cancer cells (3Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L.

The Western blots show protein levels of wild-type and mutant PR-A (Fig. 1B) and PR-B (Fig. 1C), following vehicle or R5020 (0–16 h) treatment. Down-regulation of the SUMOylation-deficient receptors was accelerated compared with their wild-type counterparts. This was especially evident for the PR-A mutant, which was 50% down-regulated by ∼1.5 h compared with ∼7.0 h for wild-type PR-A (Fig. S1). Fig. 1 also shows the transcriptional activity of a transiently expressed PRE2 reporter in cells stably expressing wild-type PR or the PR-A Lys-388 (Fig. 1D) or PR-B Lys-388 (Fig. 1E) mutants and treated with 10 nm R5020 for 24 h. Transcription by wild-type PR-A was augmented a further 5–6-fold by the Lys-388 mutant (Fig. 1D). The same pattern was observed with wild-type versus SUMOylation-deficient PR-B (Fig. 1E). Thus, impaired SUMOylation accelerates ligand-dependent down-regulation while paradoxically increasing transcription levels, demonstrating that SUMOylation dampens PR activity by suppressing down-regulation. Modulation of PR Transcriptional Activity by SUMO-1 Depends on the Promoter Context-Transcription from PR-B is usually much stronger than from PR-A on synthetic (16Tung L. Abdel-Hafiz H. Shen T.

This is due to synergism between AF-3 in PR-B and downstream AFs and is promoter-dependent (16Tung L. Abdel-Hafiz H. Shen T. Harvell D.M. Nitao L.K. Richer J.K. Sartorius C.A. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2656-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To examine the role of SUMOylation on this synergism, reporters containing zero, one, two, or three PREs were cotransfected into HeLa cells with 50 ng of cDNA encoding wild-type PR-A and PR-B, or their respective Lys-388 mutants, and R5020 was added (Fig. 2) (PR levels and down-regulation for a range of cDNA concentrations are shown in Fig. S2). PR-B-driven transcription increased 6-, 25-, and 55-fold on a PRE1, PRE2, and PRE3, respectively, a synergistic pattern of amplification. Mutation of Lys-388 failed to increase transcriptional activity of PR-B above its wild-type level on the PRE1, but a 5.5- and 6.2-fold augmentation above ligand-dependent levels were observed on PRE2 and PRE3. With regard to wild-type PR-A, their much weaker 3.0-, 3.0-, and 6.5-fold ligand-dependent activity on a PRE1, PRE2, or PRE3, was augmented 1.2-, 6.1-, and 7.5-fold with the Lys-388 mutant, equivalent to that observed with PR-B. Thus, independent of AF-3 in PR-B-upstream segment, SUMOylation limits transcriptional synergy on compound DNA response elements, which is relieved by mutation of the SUMO attachment site.

https://openalex.org/W2119643490,"Earlier work showed that TGF-beta1 potently increases angiotensinogen (AGT) gene mRNA in primary human lung fibroblasts. Here the mechanism of TGF-beta1-induced AGT expression was studied in the IMR90 human lung fibroblast cell line. The increase in AGT mRNA induced by TGF-beta1 was completely blocked by actinomycin-D. TGF-beta1 increased the activity of a full-length human AGT promoter-luciferase reporter (AGT-LUC) but did not alter AGT mRNA half-life. Serial deletion analyses revealed that 67% of TGF-beta-inducible AGT-LUC activity resides in a small domain of the AGT core promoter; this domain contains binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 and activation protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors. TGF-beta1 increased HIF-1alpha protein abundance and the activity of a hypoxia-responsive element reporter; overexpression of HIF-1 increased basal AGT-LUC activity. Both oligonucleotide pulldown and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed increased binding of JunD and HIF-1alpha to the AGT core promoter in response to TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1-inducible AGT-LUC was reduced by an AP-1 dominant negative or by mutation of the AP-1 site. Knockdown of either JunD or HIF-1alpha individually by siRNA partially reduced AGT-LUC. In contrast, simultaneous knockdown of both JunD and HIF-1alpha completely eliminated TGF-beta1-inducible AGT-LUC activity. These data suggest that TGF-beta1 up-regulates AGT transcription in human lung fibroblasts through a mechanism that requires both JunD and HIF-1alpha binding to the AGT core promoter. They also suggest a molecular mechanism linking hypoxia signaling and fibrogenic stimuli in the lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2133117999,"Nature utilizes self-assembly to fabricate structures on length scales ranging from the atomic to the macro scale. Self-assembly has emerged as a paradigm in engineering that enables the highly parallel fabrication of complex, and often three-dimensional, structures from basic building blocks. Although there have been several demonstrations of this self-assembly fabrication process, rules that govern a priori design, yield and defect tolerance remain unknown. In this paper, we have designed the first model experimental system for systematically analyzing the influence of geometry on the self-assembly of 200 and 500 µm cubes and octahedra from tethered, multi-component, two-dimensional (2D) nets. We examined the self-assembly of all eleven 2D nets that can fold into cubes and octahedra, and we observed striking correlations between the compactness of the nets and the success of the assembly. Two measures of compactness were used for the nets: the number of vertex or topological connections and the radius of gyration. The success of the self-assembly process was determined by measuring the yield and classifying the defects. Our observation of increased self-assembly success with decreased radius of gyration and increased topological connectivity resembles theoretical models that describe the role of compactness in protein folding. Because of the differences in size and scale between our system and the protein folding system, we postulate that this hypothesis may be more universal to self-assembling systems in general. Apart from being intellectually intriguing, the findings could enable the assembly of more complicated polyhedral structures (e.g. dodecahedra) by allowing a priori selection of a net that might self-assemble with high yields."
https://openalex.org/W2007538671,"Background The ambiguous role of transcription factor Sp3 for tumour progression is still debated since it was described as a transcriptional repressor or activator. Here we tried to decipher the molecular mechanisms implicated in Sp3 accumulation observed in aggressive tumours. Methodology We generated normal and tumour cell lines conditionally expressing Sp3. Cell growth was analyzed in vitro and after inoculation in nude mice. Apoptosis was assessed by pan- caspase activity assays, by counting fragmented nuclei and by determination of caspase 9 cleavage. Gene expression was determined by quantitative PCR. Cleavage by different caspases was performed after in vitro translation of the Sp3 cDNA in the presence of [S35] labelled methionine. Different tumour cell lines and head and neck tumour samples were tested for the presence of Sp3 by western blots. Correlation between Sp3 expression and overall survival has been statistically determined. Principal Findings Conditional over-expression of Sp3 induces apoptosis and modifies expression of genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and pro and anti apoptotic genes. Sp3 over-expression strongly reduces the development of tumours in nude mice confirming its pro-apoptotic potential in vivo. However, cells can survive to apoptosis through selective Sp3 cleavage by caspase. Sp3 induction in established tumours resulted in transient regression then progression. Progression coincides with re-accumulation of the full length form of Sp3. Sp3 is over-expressed in tumour cell lines of different origins. The presence of high levels of the full-length form of Sp3 indicates a poor prognosis for overall survival of patients with head and neck tumours. Conclusions Full length Sp3 accumulation highlights bypass of tumour cell apoptotic capacities and is indicative of head and neck tumours aggressiveness."

These antibodies inhibit ligand-mediated activation of IGF-1R and the resulting down-stream signaling cascade. Here we generated a panel of antibodies against IGF-1R and screened them for their ability to block the binding of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 at escalating ligand concentrations (>1 μm) to investigate allosteric versus competitive blocking mechanisms. Four distinct inhibitory classes were found as follows: 1) allosteric IGF-1 blockers, 2) allosteric IGF-2 blockers, 3) allosteric IGF-1 and IGF-2 blockers, and 4) competitive IGF-1 and IGF-2 blockers. The epitopes of representative antibodies from each of these classes were mapped using a purified IGF-1R library containing 64 mutations. Most of these antibodies bound overlapping surfaces on the cysteine-rich repeat and L2 domains. One class of allosteric IGF-1 and IGF-2 blocker was identified that bound a separate epitope on the outer surface of the FnIII-1 domain. Using various biophysical techniques, we show that the dual IGF blockers inhibit ligand binding using a spectrum of mechanisms ranging from highly allosteric to purely competitive. Binding of IGF-1 or the inhibitory antibodies was associated with conformational changes in IGF-1R, linked to the ordering of dynamic or unstructured regions of the receptor. These results suggest IGF-1R uses disorder/order within its polypeptide sequence to regulate its activity. Interestingly, the activity of representative allosteric and competitive inhibitors on H322M tumor cell growth in vitro was reflective of their individual ligand-blocking properties.

IGF-1R is activated by the binding of its constitutive ligands, IGF-1 and IGF-2 (and at a much lower affinity, insulin). Ligand binding to the IGF-1R extracellular domains leads to activation of its cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain, receptor autophosphorylation, and phosphorylation of downstream targets such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), the Src homology and collagen domain protein (Shc), and others (1Chitnis M.M.

Cancer. 2004; 4: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IRS-1 activates the phosphoinositol kinase 3/AKT cellular growth and survival pathways, and Shc phosphorylation leads to the activation of other signal cascades, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase(Erk)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cellular growth and proliferation pathways (3Adams T.E. McKern N.M. Ward C.W. Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Human IGF-1R is synthesized as a 1368-amino acid polypeptide whose primary and tertiary structures have been reviewed (4Lawrence M.C. McKern N.M. Ward C.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1050-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region (consisting of residues 1-903 of the mature protein sequence) is extracellular and highly glycosylated. C-terminal to the extracellular region are a transmembrane helix (residues 904-928) and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase signaling domain (residues 963-1239). The extracellular region can be subdivided into six distinct protein domains as follows: an N-terminal receptor L domain (L1), a cysteine-rich repeat (CRR) domain, a second receptor L domain (L2), and three type III fibronectin domains denoted FnIII-1, FnIII-2, and FnIII-3. FnIII-2 contains a long linker sequence that gets clipped between residues 708 and 710, resulting in two disulfide-linked polypeptides known as the IGF-1R α- and β-chains (5Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1050-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Similar to the insulin receptor (IR), the IGF-1R extracellular region is responsible for the constitutive dimerization via a large protein interface that includes L1, L2, FnIII-1, and FnIII-2 (6McKern N.M.

A few residues in the CRR domain have also been shown to affect IGF-1 binding. As a growth mediator, IGF-1R has been implicated in various forms of cancer (1Chitnis M.M. Yuen J.S.P. Protheroe A.S. Pollak M. Macaulay V.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 6364-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 2Pollak M.N. Schernhammer E.S. Hankinson S.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies have shown that irregular IGF-1/insulin-like growth factor-binding protein levels in human serum predispose individuals to a higher risk for common cancers. Loss of imprinting and chromosomal aberrations leading to increased IGF-2 expression or IGF-1R activity have also been linked to Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumors (10Zhan S.

Additionally, IGF-1R activity has been linked to the survival of tumor detachment events required for metastasis (2Pollak M.N. Schernhammer E.S. Hankinson S.E. Nat. Rev.

The successful development of anti-tumor agents against epidermal growth factor receptor, HER-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor provided compelling evidence that targeting receptor tyrosine kinase family proteins can be both efficacious and tolerated (13Press M.F. Lenz H.J. Drugs. 2007; 67: 2045-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The development of therapeutics against IGF-1R has included small molecule inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase domain and antibodies to the extracellular domain that inhibit receptor signaling by blocking one or both ligands or by inducing receptor down-regulation. The development of small molecule inhibitors of IGF-1R is complicated by the extremely high homology between the kinase domains of IGF-1R and IR (93% identity). Overall, IGF-1R is only 83% identical to IR, which has enabled the development of noncross-reactive anti-IGF-1R antibody inhibitors. Several companies have published the results of preclinical and clinical studies pertaining to inhibitory anti-IGF-1R antibodies (1Chitnis M.M. Yuen J.S.P. Protheroe A.S. Pollak M. Macaulay V.M.

Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 2575-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To date, results from human clinical trials have been very encouraging. Overall, the toxicity profile has been manageable, and clinical activity has been observed in certain settings both as a single agent or in combination with standards of care (1Chitnis M.M.

When combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel in a recent phase II study in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CP,751,871 antibody (Pfizer) led to a significant increase in overall objective response rates, particularly in the squamous cell carcinoma population, over carboplatin and paclitaxel alone. Both CP,751,871 and AMG479 antibodies (Amgen) have shown efficacy in Ewing sarcoma, a tumor class with known links to IGF-1R biology (15Toretsky J.A. Kalebic T. Blakesley V. LeRoith D. Helman L.J. J.

The number of antibody therapeutics directed against IGF-1R advancing through clinical trials has grown substantially over the past few years with many reaching advanced stages (phase II/III trials) (1Chitnis M.M.

Although it has been perceived that most of these antibodies exert their activity through similar mechanisms, such as receptor down-regulation, and therefore should have similar attributes, data from current clinical studies suggest that there are subtle differences among these antibodies with regard to both activity and toxicity. This may be attributed to epitope specificity and the mode of action of different antibodies. Thus, studies elucidating the structure-function relationship of inhibitory anti-IGF-1R antibodies may provide some understanding of differences in the clinical activity and safety profiles of the various antibodies currently in the clinic. In this study, we evaluated the ability of a panel of inhibitory anti-IGF-1R antibodies to block one or both of the IGF ligands. Antibodies were found that inhibit IGF-1 binding only, IGF-2 binding only, and the binding of both IGF-1 and IGF-2. We generated full-length and truncated ectodomain constructs of IGF-1R and a set of 54 variant IGF-1R constructs that include surface mutations at 64 sites primarily in the α-chain (between L1 and FnIII-2). Screening the antibodies against these IGF-1R constructs enabled residue-specific identification of all the antibody epitopes. Very subtle epitope differences are described that result in the ability of each antibody to preferentially block one or both of the ligands. Additionally, we biophysically characterized the activity of select dual IGF-blocking antibodies in detail to probe the mechanistic aspects behind IGF-1R inhibition. Recombinant Construction of hIGF-1R-(1-903), mIGF-1R-(1-904)-Fc, hIGF-1R-(1-462)-Fc, IGF-1, and IGF-2-The ectodomain of human IGF-1R was constructed from Gen-Bank™ image clones AI633655, BM905286, and BU849760. The human IGF-1R ectodomain sequence encoding the polypeptide signal and residues 1-903 was subcloned into mammalian expression vectors with or without fusion sequences encoding a C-terminal human IgG1-Fc (constant domain fragment containing an IgG1 hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains). The expressed proteins are denoted hIGF-1R-(1-903)-Fc and hIGF-1R-(1-903), respectively. The primers used to subclone the ectodomain protein in the absence of the IgG1-Fc enabled the addition of a C-terminal decahistidine tag. A truncated human IGF-1R construct (hIGF-1R(1-462)-Fc) was subcloned into the expression vector using the parental hIGF-1R-(1-903)-Fc vector as template. A similar truncated version of the IGF-1R ectodomain has been described (9McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Verkuylen A. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Ivancic N. Elleman T.C. Garrett T.P.J. Cosgrove L.J.

The protein was purified by batch purification using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), followed by Q-Sepharose (Fast Flow) and preparative SEC using Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare). Synthetic genes encoding human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with N-terminal octahistidine tags were synthesized by GeneArt AG and subcloned into pPICZαA (Invitrogen). The recombinant ligands were expressed in Pichia and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The ligands were further purified by reverse phase chromatography using a Waters Delta Prep HPLC and a preparative XBridge C18 column with H2O/acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) gradients. The polypeptides were lyophilized, resuspended in deionized H2O, and dialyzed (molecular mass cutoff, 1000, Supelco) against PBS before use. Untagged recombinant human IGF-1 was purchased (Chemicon). Anti-IGF-1R Antibodies-Antibodies were generated against the hIGF-1R-(1-903)-Fc protein by both murine immunization and subsequent hybridoma generation (including BIIB1-3) and in vitro library/phage display (including BIIB4-5) methods (20Hariharan, K., Graff, C., Glaser, S., Garber, E., Reyes, C.

The BIIB1 and BIIB3 murine heavy chain variable domains (VH) and light chain variable domains (VL) and the BIIB4 and BIIB5 human VH and VL domains were subcloned into heavy and light chain vectors containing either engineered human IgG4 heavy or κ light chain constant domains, respectively, to form full-length chimeric or human antibodies as described (20Hariharan, K., Graff, C., Glaser, S., Garber, E., Reyes, C.

The expression plasmids were transfected into CHO-DG44 or CHO-DG44i (a host strain selected to be insulin-independent), and stable bulk CHO pools or CHO cell lines expressing each antibody were produced and cultured as described (19Brezinsky S.C.G.

The antibodies were purified using protein A (protein A-Sepharose FF, GE Healthcare) using PBS as the running buffer and 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0, as the elution buffer. Eluants were neutralized to pH 8.5 using Tris base. The eluants were further purified by capture on an anion exchange resin (TMAE Fractogel®, EMD Biosciences), followed by elution using a 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5, and a 10 mm to 1 m NaCl gradient. Each antibody was dialyzed into PBS. A commercially available inhibitory anti-IGF-1R antibody (αIR-3 (23Jacobs S. Cook S. Svoboda M.E. Van Wyk J.J. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) was purchased from Calbiochem. BIIB4 and BIIB5 Fab Preparation-BIIB4 and BIIB5 antibodies were digested using immobilized papain resin (Pierce). The papain resin was washed with a solution of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm EDTA, and 20 mm cysteine (reduced) at pH 7.0. Each antibody was mixed with immobilized papain resin in 500 mm EDTA and 100 mm cysteine, pH 7.0, and digested for 3 h in a 37 °C water bath, followed by mixing on an inverting shaker overnight at room temperature. Completion of the digestion was determined by analytical SEC. The resin was removed from the digested material using a sintered glass funnel filter washed with 20 mm acetate, pH 5.0. The flow-through was collected and diluted 10-fold with 20 mm acetate, pH 5.0. Fabs were purified by S-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography using a linear salt gradient. Fabs were collected after identification using analytical SEC. The Fabs were dialyzed into PBS. A solution containing 1 m Tris, 200 mm iodoacetate, pH 8.5, was diluted 10-fold into the Fab solutions to alkylate free thiols within the hinge region generated during the digestion. The resulting solutions were incubated on an inverting shaker for 20 min at room temperature, and excess iodoacetate was removed by exhaustive dialysis into PBS. Analytical SEC/Static Light Scattering and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)-The oligomeric state of each protein sample used in this report was analyzed by SEC/static light scattering. Between 30 and 100 μl protein was injected onto a TSK-gel G3000SWXL, 7.8 mm × 30 cm, 250-Å analytical SEC column (Tosoh Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8, using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. Light scattering data for material eluting from the SEC column were collected using a mini-DAWN static light scattering detector coupled to an in-line refractive index meter (Wyatt Technologies). UV data were analyzed using HPCHEM (Agilent), and light scattering data were analyzed using ASTRA V (Wyatt Technologies). DSC scans were performed using an automated capillary DSC (capDSC, MicroCal, LLC). hIGF-1R-(1-903) protein solutions and reference (buffer) solutions were sampled automatically from 96-well plates using the robotic attachment. Prior to each protein scan, two buffer scans were performed to define the base line for subtraction. All 96-well plates containing protein were stored within the instrument at 6 °C. Each sample was diluted to 1 mg/ml in PBS. Scans were performed from 10 to 95 °C at 2 °C/min using the low feedback mode. Scans were analyzed using the Origin software supplied by the manufacturer. Subsequent to the subtraction of reference base-line scans, nonzero protein scan base lines were corrected using a third-order polynomial. The unfolding parameters for hIGF-1R-(1-903) were deconvoluted using the multiple peak fitting routine within the software assuming non-two-state unfolding behavior. Antibody Cross-blocking Studies-The ability of various anti-IGF-1R antibodies to block BIIB4 or BIIB5 was determined using biotinylated versions of both antibodies and hIGF-1R-(1-903)-Fc. BIIB4 and BIIB5 were biotinylated using the protocols within the EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin kit (Pierce). Fifty μl of 2 μg/ml hIGF-1R-Fc in PBS were coated per well of a 96-well clear MaxiSorp plate (Nunc) for 2 h at room temperature and no shaking. Plates were washed with PBS and blocked overnight at 2-8 °C using a PBS, 1% BSA solution. Plates were washed and incubated with a 100 μl mixture of biotinylated BIIB4 or BIIB5 (80 ng/ml) and competitor antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Inhibitor antibodies were serially diluted (5-fold dilutions) from 40 μg/ml to 3 ng/ml. A control was also performed by serial dilution of a nonspecific IgG4 isotype control antibody with biotinylated BIIB4 or BIIB5. Plates were washed and shaken for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl/well streptavidin-HRP (1:4000 dilution into blocking buffer, Southern Biotech). Plates were washed, and 100 μl/well SureBlue Reserve TMB Microwell peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) was added to the wells. Detection of the presence of biotinylated BIIB4 or BIIB5 was performed by reading the absorbance at 650 nm every 5 min using a Wallac 1420-041 Multilabel Counter plate reader. IGF-1 and IGF-2 Blocking Assays-hIGF-1R-Fc was biotinylated using protocols within the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin kit (Pierce). Biotinylated hIGF-1R-Fc at 5 μg/ml was added to the wells of SigmaScreen streptavidin-coated 96-well plates (Sigma) at 100 μl/well and incubated overnight at 2-8 °C. The plates were then washed four times with 200 μl/well PBST. IGF-1 (8× histidine-tagged) was added at 320 nm in PBST with 1.0 mg/ml BSA. To test the ability of the antibodies to compete with IGF-1 for hIGF-1R-(1-903)-Fc binding, serial dilutions of anti-IGF-1R antibodies (generally starting between 1 and 10 μm) were made into the IGF-1 solutions. IGF-2 binding was assessed in a similar manner. IGF-2 (8× histidine-tagged) was added at 640 nm in PBST with 1.0 mg/ml BSA. The dilutions were added to the plates in duplicate at 100 μl/well, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were then washed four times with 200 μl/well PBST. An HRP-conjugated anti-His tag antibody (Penta-His HRP conjugate, Qiagen) was diluted 1:1000 in PBST and added to plates at 100 μl/well, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were then washed four times with 200 μl/well PBST. SureBlue Reserve TMB Microwell peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) was added to plates at 100 μl/well followed by 1% phosphoric acid at 100 μl/well once the desired reaction was observed. The absorbance of each well was determined at 450 nm. Kinetic Analysis of the Binding of IGFs and Antibodies to hIGF-1R-(1-903)-All surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed on a Biacore 3000 set to 25 °C using HBS-EP running buffer (Biacore). For the kinetic analyses, a biotin-labeled anti-His tag antibody (biotin-Penta-His, Qiagen) was immobilized to saturation on a Biacore SA chip surface by injection at 500 nm in HBS-EP buffer. hIGF-1R-(1-903) was captured on the biotin-Penta-His surface by injecting 20 μl of 40 nm protein at 2 μl/min. Serially diluted concentration series (starting at 64 nm) of antibodies, antibody Fabs, or IGF-1 were injected over the hIGF-1R-(1-903) surface at 20 μl/min, followed minimally by a 20-min dissociation period where buffer was run over the sensorchip surface. Each injection was regenerated using 3× 10-μl injections of 10 mm acetate, pH 4.0, at 20 μl/min. Each curve was double referenced using the following: 1) data obtained from a streptavidin surface devoid of hIGF-1R-(1-903), and 2) data from a primary injection of hIGF-1R-(1-903), followed by a secondary injection of HBS-EP buffer. The sensorgrams for each construct were fit to the 1:1 Langmuir binding model within BiaEval 3.0 (Biacore). Binding of IGF-1 to IGF-1R was also performed in the presence of BIIB5. In these studies, 400 nm BIIB5 was added to the mobile phase, the hIGF-1R-(1-903) solution, and the IGF-1 solutions used to measure the ligand/receptor kinetics. Equilibrium IGF-1 Binding to IGF-1R in the Presence and Absence of Inhibitory Antibodies Using SPR-hIGF-1R-(1-903)-Fc was immobilized (∼15,000 RUs) to a CM5 chip surface using standard amine chemistry protocols provided by Biacore. At this high immobilization level, flowing IGF-1 over the IGF-1R(1-903)-Fc surface led to mass transfer limited linear binding curves whose initial velocity of binding, Vi (RU/s), depended linearly on the concentration of the IGF-1 solution flowed over the chip surface. Binding constants between hIGF-1R-(1-903) and IGF-1 could be determined by flowing mixtures of hIGF-1R-(1-903) and IGF-1 over the sensorchip surface containing sIGF-1R-Fc. The hIGF-1R(10-903)-Fc sensorchip surface measures the concentration of unbound IGF-1 in each hIGF-1R-(1-903)/IGF-1 mixture. The equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, and binding stoichiometry, n, between IGF-1 and hIGF-1R-(1-903) are determined by the concentration of unbound IGF-1 using Equation 1, Vi=mċ([IGF-1]T-12{(n[R]T+[IGF-1]T+KD)-(N[R]T+[IGF-1]T+KD)2-4n[R]T[IGF-1]T}) where Vi is initial rate of binding; m is slope of the IGF-1 concentration-dependent standard curve; [IGF-1]f is unbound IGF-1 concentration = Vi/m; [IGF-1]t is total IGF-1 concentration; and [R]t is the total hIGF-1R-(1-903) concentration (24Day E.S. Cachero T.G. Qian F. Sun Y. Wen D. Pelletier M. Hsu Y.M. Whitty A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1919-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). IGF-1 binding to precomplexed mixtures of hIGF-1R-(1-903) and inhibitory mAbs was performed in an identical fashion. The mAbs and hIGF-1R-(1-903) were equimolar (240 nm) in these experiments. Analytical SEC was used to ensure that the mixtures were precisely equimolar. Additionally, the hIGF-1R-(1-903)/mAb mixtures were passed over the hIGF-1R-(1-903)-Fc sensorchip in the absence of IGF-1 to ensure no residual mAb binding to the surface occurred that might complicate the results.

https://openalex.org/W1966663468,"Myofibrillogenesis, the precise assembly of sarcomeric proteins into the highly organized sarcomeres, is essential for muscle cell differentiation and function. Myofibrillogenesis requires proper folding and assembly of newly synthesized sarcomeric proteins. sknac (skeletal naca) is an alternatively spliced isoform of naca, which encodes the nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha polypeptide that binds to newly synthesized polypeptides emerging from the ribosome. sknac is specifically expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles. However, little is known about the function of skNAC in muscle development in vivo. To determine skNAC function, we have isolated and characterized the sknac gene from zebrafish. Zebrafish sknac cDNA differs from naca by containing an extra large exon that encodes 815 aa. Knockdown of sknac expression by antisense oligos resulted in zebrafish embryos with skeletal muscle defects. The sknac-knockdown embryos showed a paralyzed phenotype with little muscle contraction. In contrast, injection of a control oligo had no effect. Immunostaining and histological analyses revealed that sknac-knockdown embryos contained disorganized thick and thin filaments. Western blot analysis revealed that myosin protein levels were significantly reduced. Collectively, these results demonstrate that skNAC plays a vital role in myofibril assembly and function during muscle cell differentiation."

Although several signaling pathways are activated during engagement of the type I IFN receptor and participate in the induction of IFN responses, the mechanisms of generation of specific signals for distinct biological effects remain to be elucidated. We provide evidence that a novel member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins is rapidly phosphorylated and activated during engagement of the type I IFN receptor. In contrast to other members of the PKC family that are also regulated by IFN receptors, PKCη does not regulate IFN-inducible transcription of interferon-stimulated genes or generation of antiviral responses. However, its function promotes cell cycle arrest and is essential for the generation of the suppressive effects of IFNα on normal and leukemic human myeloid (colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage) bone marrow progenitors.

Beyond their relevance in the regulation of innate responses, the important biological effects of IFNs have led to extensive clinical-translational work over the years that resulted in their introduction in clinical medicine as antiviral and antitumor agents, although they are also used in clinical neurology for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (4Parmar S.

One of the most important biological activities of IFNs is their ability to act as regulators of normal hematopoietic progenitor cell growth and to control normal hematopoiesis.

However, much remains to be defined regarding the overall contribution of the PKC family to the generation of IFN responses as well as the specific roles of distinct isoforms in IFN signaling. In this study we provide the first evidence for engagement of PKCη, a member of the novel subgroup of PKC isotypes in type I IFN signaling. Our data establish that this PKC isoform is phosphorylated/activated by IFNα or IFNβ treatment of sensitive cells. We also show that engagement of PKCη by the type I IFN receptor regulates IFNα-dependent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and plays an essential role in the generation of the suppressive effects of type I IFNs on normal and leukemic myeloid (CFU-GM) progenitors. Altogether, our findings implicate PKCη as a novel member of the PKC family with an important role in the generation of IFN responses and define a unique and specific role for this PKC isoform in IFN-mediated control of myelopoiesis.

Briefly, cells were serum-starved, stimulated with 1 × 104 IU/ml of the indicated IFNs and then immunoprecipitated overnight with an anti-PKCη antibody or rabbit IgG as a control. Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with phosphorylation lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm ATP). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer to which 5 μg of histone H1 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature prior to termination following the addition of SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated histone H1 was detected by autoradiography. The blot was subsequently immunoblotted with an anti-PKCη antibody. Luciferase Assays—Cells were transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector and either an ISRE luciferase construct (22Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R.

The ISRE-luciferase construct was previously provided by Dr. Richard Pine (Public Health Research Institute, New York). The 8×-GAS construct was previously provided by Dr. Christopher Glass (University of California, San Diego). Forty eight hours after transfection, triplicate cultures were either left untreated or treated with PKCη or PKCζ peptide inhibitors (Calbiochem) for 60 min. Following inhibitor incubation, triplicate cultures were then either left untreated or treated with 5 × 103 units/ml IFNα or IFNβ as indicated, and luciferase activity was measured as in our previous studies (22Uddin S.

In addition, in some experiments U2OS cells were also transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector, an ISRE luciferase construct (22Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y.

Evaluation of Apoptosis and Cell Cycle—Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid constructs via nucleofection (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The evaluation of apoptosis was assessed by annexin V-propidium iodide staining using an apoptosis detection kit (Pharmingen), as in previous studies (41Kannan-Thulasiraman P. Katsoulidis E.

Briefly, the cells were synchronized by serum starvation for 24 h, and then re-plated in media containing serum, pretreated with PKCη or PKCζ peptide inhibitor (Calbiochem) for 60 min, followed by treatment with 2500–3000 units/ml of IFNα for 24 h. Cells were then harvested, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with ice-cold ethanol, and incubated for 20 min with propidium iodide (Sigma) prior to flow cytometric analysis. Antiviral Assays—The antiviral effects of human IFNα and IFNβ were determined as in our previous studies (27Kaur S. Lal L. Sassano A. Majchrzak-Kita B. Srikanth M. Baker D.P. Petroulakis E. Hay N. Sonenberg N. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 1757-1768Google Scholar), using EMCV as the challenge virus. In initial studies, we sought to determine whether PKCη is phosphorylated in response to treatment of cells with different type I IFNs. We examined the effects of IFNα on the phosphorylation of PKCη in IFN-sensitive hematopoietic cell lines. KT1 or U266 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of IFNα for different times, and cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated form of PKCη against Ser-674. IFNα induced strong phosphorylation of PKCη in both cell lines studied (Fig. 1, A and B). Similarly, treatment of KT1 or U266 cells with another type I IFN, IFNβ, also resulted in strong phosphorylation of PKCη (Fig. 1, C and D). To directly determine whether the kinase domain of PKCη is activated in a type I IFN-dependent manner, experiments were performed in which lysates from IFNα- or IFNβ-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-PKCη antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase assays using histone H1 as an exogenous substrate. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of cells with either IFNα (Fig. 2A) or IFNβ (Fig. 2B) resulted in PKCη kinase activity, indicating that the kinase domain of this PKC isoform is activated during its engagement by the type I IFN receptor.FIGURE 2Type I IFN-dependent activation of PKCη. A, KT1 cells were serum-starved overnight, treated with IFNα for 20 min, and lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-PKCη antibody or control nonimmune rabbit immunoglobulin (RIgG) as indicated and subjected to in vitro kinase assays, using histone H1 as an exogenous substrate. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated histone H1 was detected by autoradiography. The blot from the kinase assay was subsequently immunoblotted with an anti-PKCη antibody to control for loading.

To determine whether PKCη also regulates type IFN-dependent transcription, luciferase promoter assays were performed to determine the effects of PKCη inhibition on IFN-dependent transcriptional activity via ISRE or GAS elements. U2OS cells were transfected with either ISRE or 8×-GAS luciferase constructs and pretreated with a PKCη-specific peptide inhibitor prior to treatment with either IFNα or IFNβ. Luciferase activity was then measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Inhibition of PKCη activity had no significant effects on IFNα-inducible luciferase activity for ISRE elements (Fig. 3A). Similarly, although there was some minimal decrease in IFNβ-inducible luciferase activity in the presence of the PKCη peptide inhibited, there was still clear inducible IFNβ-dependent transcription (Fig. 3B), suggesting that PKCη activity is not essential for type I IFN-dependent transcriptional activation via ISRE elements. Consistent with this, overexpression of a constitutively active PKCη mutant did not result in enhanced transcription via ISRE elements (Fig. 3C). Pretreatment of cells with an inhibitor against an atypical PKC isoform, PKCζ (used as a control), had also no significant effects on type I IFN-dependent transcriptional activation via ISRE elements (Fig. 3D). Similarly, inhibition of either PKCη (Fig. 3, E and F) or PKCζ (Fig. 3G) activities had no significant effects on type I IFN-dependent transcription via GAS elements. Because IFN-induced transcription is strongly associated with generation of IFN-dependent antiviral responses, we also assessed the effects of PKCη inhibition on antiviral activity. U2OS cells were pretreated with PKCη pseudo-substrate inhibitor and then challenged with EMCV. As shown in Fig. 4, both IFNα and IFNβ protected U2OS cells from the cytopathic effects of EMCV in a dose-dependent manner, but inhibition of PKCη activity did not reverse such IFN-induced antiviral protection (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, in contrast to two other members of the group of novel PKC isoforms (δ and θ) whose activities are required for type I IFN-dependent gene transcription (29Uddin S. Sassano A. Deb D.K. Verma A.

https://openalex.org/W2004304744,"The ssrA gene encodes tmRNA that, together with a specialized tmRNA-binding protein, SmpB, forms part of a ribonucleoprotein complex, provides a template for the resumption of translation elongation, subsequent termination and recycling of stalled ribosomes. In addition, the mRNA-like domain of tmRNA encodes a peptide that tags polypeptides derived from stalled ribosomes for degradation. Streptomyces are unique bacteria that undergo a developmental cycle culminating at sporulation that is at least partly controlled at the level of translation elongation by the abundance of a rare tRNA that decodes UUA codons found in a relatively small number of open reading frames prompting us to examine the role of tmRNA in S. coelicolor. Using a temperature sensitive replicon, we found that the ssrA gene could be disrupted only in cells with an extra-copy wild type gene but not in wild type cells or cells with an extra-copy mutant tmRNA (tmRNA(DD)) encoding a degradation-resistant tag. A cosmid-based gene replacement method that does not include a high temperature step enabled us to disrupt both the ssrA and smpB genes separately and at the same time suggesting that the tmRNA tagging system may be required for cell survival under high temperature. Indeed, mutant cells show growth and sporulation defects at high temperature and under optimal culture conditions. Interestingly, even though these defects can be completely restored by wild type genes, the DeltassrA strain was only partially corrected by tmRNA(DD). In addition, wildtype tmRNA can restore the hygromycin-resistance to DeltassrA cells while tmRNA(DD) failed to do so suggesting that degradation of aberrant peptides is important for antibiotic resistance. Overall, these results suggest that the tmRNA tagging system plays important roles during Streptomyces growth and sporulation under both normal and stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2012122513,"The light-driven pump Halorhodopsin (hR) uses the energy stored in an initial meta-stable state (K), in which the bound retinal chromophore has been photoisomerized from all-trans to 13-cis, to drive the translocation of one chloride anion across the membrane. Thus far it was unclear whether retinal twisting or charge separation between the positive Schiff base of the retinal and the chloride anion is the primary mechanism of energy storage. Here, combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations show that the energy is predominantly stored by charge separation. However, a large variability in retinal twisting is observed, thus reconciling the contradictory hypotheses for storage. Surprisingly, the energy stored in the K-state amounts to only one-fifth of the photon energy. We explain why the protein cannot store more: even though this would accelerate chloride pumping, raising the K-state also reduces the relative energy barriers against unproductive decay, in particular via the premature cis to trans back-isomerization. Indeed, the protein has maximized its storage so that the back-isomerization barriers are just high enough (> or =18 kcal/mol) to keep the decay rate (1/100 ms) slower than the remaining photocycle (1/20 ms). This need to stabilize the captured photon-energy until it can be used in subsequent steps is inherent to light-driven proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2067031436,"Background Existence of flows and convection is an essential and integral feature of many excitable media with wave propagation modes, such as blood coagulation or bioreactors. Methods/Results Here, propagation of two-dimensional waves is studied in parabolic channel flow of excitable medium of the FitzHugh-Nagumo type. Even if the stream velocity is hundreds of times higher that the wave velocity in motionless medium (), steady propagation of an excitation wave is eventually established. At high stream velocities, the wave does not span the channel from wall to wall, forming isolated excited regions, which we called “restrictons”. They are especially easy to observe when the model parameters are close to critical ones, at which waves disappear in still medium. In the subcritical region of parameters, a sufficiently fast stream can result in the survival of excitation moving, as a rule, in the form of “restrictons”. For downstream excitation waves, the axial portion of the channel is the most important one in determining their behavior. For upstream waves, the most important region of the channel is the near-wall boundary layers. The roles of transversal diffusion, and of approximate similarity with respect to stream velocity are discussed. Conclusions These findings clarify mechanisms of wave propagation and survival in flow."
https://openalex.org/W1986037504,"Recent studies have shown that cytoplasmic proteins are exported efficiently in Escherichia coli only if they are attached to signal peptides that are recognized by the signal recognition particle and are thereby targeted to the SecYEG complex cotranslationally. The evidence suggests that the entry of these proteins into the secretory pathway at an early stage of translation is necessary to prevent them from folding into a translocation-incompetent conformation. We found, however, that several glycolytic enzymes attached to signal peptides that are recognized by the signal recognition particle were exported inefficiently. Based on previous studies of post-translational export, we hypothesized that the export block was due to the presence of basic residues at the extreme N terminus of each enzyme. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the introduction of negatively charged residues into this segment increased the efficiency of export. Export efficiency was sensitive to the number, position, and sequence context of charged residues. The importance of charge for efficient export was underscored by an in silico analysis that revealed a conserved negative charge bias at the N terminus of the mature region of bacterial presecretory proteins. Our results demonstrate that cotranslational targeting of a protein to the E. coli SecYEG complex does not ensure its export but that export also depends on a subsequent event (most likely the initiation of translocation) that involves sequences both within and just beyond the signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2020460941,"Proteome data of potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber juice and of purified potato tuber vacuoles indicated that mature patatins may perhaps lack a C-terminal propeptide. We have confirmed this by complete mass spectrometric sequencing of a number of patatin variants as well as their N-linked complex-type glycans from the starch-rich cultivar Kuras. For this cultivar full-length patatin cDNAs have also been sequenced, as the patatin locus is highly polymorphous. It is well known that patatins are located in the vacuoles of potato tubers. Furthermore, the complex glycan structures show that the path is via the Golgi apparatus. However, the vacuolar targeting signal has never been identified for this storage and defense protein, which amounts to 25-40% of tuber protein. We propose that a six-residue C-terminal propeptide, -ANKASY-COO(-) comprises this signal. The crystallographic structure of a recombinant patatin (Rydel, T. J., Williams, J. M., Krieger, E., Moshiri, F., Stallings, W. C., Brown, S. M., Pershing, J. C., Prucell, J. P., and Alibhai, M. F.

https://openalex.org/W2051038118,"Background Perception of the cardinal directions of the body, right-left, up-down, ahead-behind, which appears so absolute and fundamental to the organisation of behaviour can in fact, be modified. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it has been shown that prolonged distorted perception of the orientation of body axes can be a consequence of disordered sensori-motor signals, including long-term prismatic adaptation and lesions of the central nervous system. We report the novel and surprising finding that a long-lasting distortion of perception of personal space can also be induced by an ecological pointing task without the artifice of distorting normal sensori-motor relationships. Methodology/Principal Findings Twelve right-handed healthy adults performed the task of pointing with their arms, without vision, to indicate their subjective ‘straight ahead’, a task often used to assess the Egocentric Reference. This was performed before, immediately, and one day after a second task intended to ‘modulate’ perception of spatial direction. The ‘modulating’ task lasted 5 minutes and consisted of asking participants to point with the right finger to targets that appeared only in one (right or left) half of a computer screen. Estimates of the ‘straight-ahead’ during pre-test were accurate (inferior to 0.3 degrees deviation). Significantly, up to one day after performing the modulating task, the subjective ‘straight-ahead’ was deviated (by approximately 3.2 degrees) to the same side to which subjects had pointed to targets. Conclusion/Significance These results reveal that the perception of directional axes for behaviour is readily influenced by interactions with the environment that involve no artificial distortion of normal sensori-motor-spatial relationships and does not necessarily conform to the cardinal directions as defined by the anatomy of orthostatic posture. We thus suggest that perceived space is a dynamic construction directly dependent upon our past experience about the direction and/or the localisation of our sensori-motor spatial interaction with environment."

Obama, during his campaign, repeatedly promised to lift the ban, even stating during the Science Debate that he would reverse the policy via Executive Order. “As somebody who's a stem cell research advocate and has been in a wheelchair now for 24 years, I am thrilled about the prospect of President Obama lifting the Bush restrictions as he takes office,” says Danny Heumann of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. “Whatever federal monies that we can get for this research I think will pay huge dividends in making sure that we get ethical, moral research done in this country, and get cures and treatments from the labs to patients' bedsides.” “We have had this great engine of scientific progress, the NIH, basically on the sidelines of stem cell research. There's much work to be done to make up for this,” says Bernard Siegel, executive director of the Genetics Policy Institute, a stem cell stakeholders umbrella organization that promotes research advocacy initiatives. In the years since President Bush's funding ban, the stem cell research community has learned to get by largely on its own. For one thing, a rich variety of organizations have emerged to fill the funding vacuum. States such as Wisconsin and California and patient advocacy groups now form a patchwork of granting institutions that have supplied the funds keeping U.S. stem cell programs alive. Meanwhile, to ensure a complete work separation between the so-called presidential cell lines and those derived more recently, scientists have learned to buy duplicates of all of lab equipment or set up second labs, and universities have established parallel accounting systems. Exactly how the Obama Administration might alter the hESC research landscape remains unknown. Though the anticipated blessing of the White House appears to signal a new era, many pitfalls lie ahead, with legal, financial, and other hurdles lurking along the way. Scientists themselves are uniformly enthusiastic about the anticipated policy shift. “The whole world sees this as a very important movement for freeing up opportunities for U.S. researchers to have an impact in this area,” says Alan Trounson, head of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. “We could avoid duplication and work together in a concerted way to enable whatever opportunities exist to be evaluated much sooner than previously possible,” Trounson adds. Allowing federal funding to support research on more lines would clear up many fundamental research questions, says Story Landis, Director of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Chair of the NIH Task Force on Stem Cells. With more and more researchers reporting new ways to induce pluripotent cells from adult tissues, “is it still important to be using hESC? The answer is we simply don't know. Expanding the ability of NIH to fund stem cell research would allow those comparisons to be done in a much more straightforward and expeditious fashion.” Researcher Derek Hei expects any Obama policy shift to speed progress toward clinical trials. As the technical director of the National Stem Cell Bank, which is charged with characterizing and distributing the 21 so-called presidential registry lines exempt from the federal ban, Hei is acutely aware of these cells' shortcomings. One of the biggest problems surrounding these lines is their suitability for clinical trials. Most were derived using mouse feeder cells and might be contaminated with murine retroviruses. If transplanted into patients during clinical trials, they carry the risk of introducing new pathogens into humans. “Since then, we have made significant progress in understanding how to culture new stem cell lines without feeder cells. And I would much rather distribute lines that we know could go into clinical trials and not have human transplantation issues,” Hei says. Others await the creation of federal rules and procedures to clear up confusion surrounding the ethical derivation of new embryonic stem cell lines. “Right now, every granting entity has its own rules and regulations regarding stem cell research ethics. So we're forced to look into the provenance of every single cell line,” says Bernard Siegel. Any new federal rules would likely be adopted across granting agencies by default. Meanwhile, stem cell organizations funded by the states are unlikely to change course in a new funding landscape. “I don't think we'll see states that have already funded stem cell research institutes cut back. But it could be that more states would be hesitant to start these organizations now,” Siegel says. Having a central source of funding is also expected to staunch the brain drain from states lacking such funding organizations. Yet the time when those federal funds can finally be released might be further off than scientists believe. On inauguration day, Obama's transition team had no comment on when he might act to lift the ban, only that it would not occur in the first few days after he takes office. The delay may signal a more nuanced approach to what experts say is complex legal territory. If President Obama attempts to issue an executive order reversing the funding ban, warns Louis Guenin, a lecturer at Harvard University Law School and an expert on stem cell law, he will run into the legislative equivalent of a brick wall. That obstacle is known as the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, a piece of legislation that forbids the use of federal funds to support research “in which human embryos are created, destroyed, discarded, or knowingly be subjected to risk of injury or death greater than allowed for research on fetuses in utero.” It was passed in 1996 and has been almost automatically renewed by Congress every year since. “The permission granted from an Executive Order is not broad enough. NIH would lose the lawsuit. The only reason for this stroke of the pen action is grandstanding by Obama,” Guenin says. Not only does Dickey-Wicker pose a practical barrier to federal funding, but it is also inconsistent with any federally supported hESC research policy. “To fund studies of new stem cell lines but not the derivation of those lines is an artificial line. Because once you support investment in studying these lines, you're indirectly supporting the destruction of embryos,” Guenin says. The only route around the wall, according to Guenin, is for Congress to pass legislation overriding Dickey-Wicker. The so-called DeGette bill, which permits research on hESC lines derived from surplus embryos created for reproductive uses, has already been introduced on Capitol Hill. If the bill comes up for a vote, reckons Cynthia Cohen of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University, the relatively liberal current Congress is likely to pass it. However, the DeGette bill could still be challenged in court on the basis of Dickey-Wicker. If that came to pass, Congress would get an opportunity to repeal the amendment. If and when the Obama Administration overcomes these legal hurdles, it's an open question as to how many federal dollars might be available to flow toward hESC research. The country is mired in the deepest recession in recent memory, and the NIH budget has essentially been flat or falling in terms of real dollars for several years. Despite these potential setbacks, hope for a more nurturing environment for hESC research is in the air. “The future is extremely bright for the entire field of regenerative medicine,” Siegel says. “It'll be a powerful new force unleashed.” New Administration Likely to Bring Change to Stem Cell ResearchKathleen M.

Time of survival was dependent on the dose of RADA and pre-incubation with PrPsc prior to inoculation. RADA treatment resulted in the absence of detectable PrPsc at 40 d followed by an increased rate of PrPsc accumulation at 75 d up to sacrifice. In all PrPsc inoculated animals, clinical symptoms were observed approximately 10 d prior to sacrifice and brains showed spongiform degeneration with Congo red positive plaques. A time-dependent increase in reactive gliosis was observed in both groups with more GFAP detected in RADA treated animals at all time points. The PrP protein showed dose-dependent binding to RADA and this binding was competitively inhibited by Congo Red. We conclude that RADA disrupts the efficacy of prion transmission by altering the rate of PrPsc accumulation. This is the first demonstration that a self-assembling biomolecular peptide can interact with PrPsc, disrupt the course of Scrapie disease process, and extend survival."
