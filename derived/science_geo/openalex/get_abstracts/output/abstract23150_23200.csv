https://openalex.org/W2033525233,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of the glutamate receptor is an important mediator of several forms of neural and behavioral plasticity. The present studies examined whether NMDA receptors might be involved in the development of opiate tolerance and dependence, two examples of behavioral plasticity. The noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 attenuated the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine without affecting acute morphine analgesia. In addition, MK-801 attenuated the development of morphine dependence as assessed by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. These results suggest that NMDA receptors may be important in the development of opiate tolerance and dependence."

However, the neural mechanisms of these oscillations are largely unknown. Many pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the neocortex showed prolonged, 5- to 12-hertz rhythmic firing patterns at threshold. Rhythmic firing was due to intrinsic membrane properties, sodium conductances were essential for rhythmicity, and calcium-dependent conductances strongly modified rhythmicity. Isolated slices of neocortex generated epochs of 4- to 10-hertz synchronized activity when N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated channels were facilitated. Layer 5 was both necessary and sufficient to produce these synchronized oscillations. Thus, synaptic networks of intrinsically rhythmic neurons in layer 5 may generate or promote certain synchronized oscillations of the neocortex."

At least seven such proteins were detected in extracts of multiple human tumor cell lines. These proteins failed to bind to a family of pRB fusion proteins that harbor inactivating mutations in the T/EIA-binding domain and to the wild-type fusion protein in the presence of a peptide replica of the pRB-binding domain of T Therefore, the binding of one or more of these proteins may contribute to the growth-suppressing function of pRB."
https://openalex.org/W2075772363,"An attractive hypothesis for hair-cell transduction is that fine, filamentous ""tip links"" pull directly on mechanically sensitive ion channels located at the tips of the stereocilia. We tested the involvement of tip links in the transduction process by treating bundles with a BAPTA-buffered, low-Ca2+ saline (10(-9) M). BAPTA abolished the transduction current in a few hundred milliseconds. BAPTA treatment for a few seconds eliminated the tip links observed by either scanning or transmission electron microscopy. BAPTA also eliminated the voltage-dependent movement and caused a positive bundle displacement of 133 nm, in quantitative agreement with a model for regulation of tension. We conclude that tip links convey tension to the transduction channels of hair cells."
https://openalex.org/W1559817730,"Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) is a low density lipoprotein-like particle which contains the plasminogen-like apolipoprotein a. Lp(a) levels are elevated in patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Recent studies suggest that Lp(a) competitively inhibits plasminogen binding to the endothelial cell and interferes with surface-associated plasmin generation. In this study, we present evidence for the presence of Lp(a) in the microvasculature of inflamed tissue. In addition, we demonstrate that Lp(a) regulates endothelial cell synthesis of a major fibrinolytic protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In cultured human endothelial cells, Lp(a) enhanced PAI-1 antigen, activity, and steady-state mRNA levels without altering tissue plasminogen activator activity or mRNA transcript levels. This effect was cell-specific. Although other lipoproteins did not coordinately raise PAI-1 mRNA levels in endothelial cells, low density lipoprotein treatment selectively raised the level of the 3.4-kilobase mRNA species of PAI-1 without a concomitant increase in PAI-1 activity or antigen. Endothelial cell exposure to Lp(a) did not cause generalized endothelial cell activation since the functional activity and mRNA levels for tissue factor, platelet-derived growth factor and interleukin-6 were not elevated following Lp(a) exposure. These data suggest a molecular mechanism whereby Lp(a) may support a specific prothrombotic endothelial cell phenotype, namely by increasing PAI-1 expression."

https://openalex.org/W1577239482,"The mgtB locus codes for one of three distinct Mg2+ transport systems of Salmonella typhimurium. The system encoded by the mgtB locus mediates Mg2+ influx only. The nucleotide sequence of a 4.6-kilobase fragment of DNA carrying mgtB has been determined. Two open reading frames were apparent. The most 5' (mgtC) could encode a hydrophobic protein of up to 25 kDa depending on which translation starts are used. A plasmid carrying this region downstream from a phage T7 promoter expresses a 22.5-kDa protein. The second open reading frame encoded a 101-kDa polypeptide (MgtB) consistent with our previous observation that a plasmid carrying the mgtB locus expresses a 102-kDa protein in maxicells. Insertions into either open reading frame abolished the ability of the plasmid to relieve the requirement for added Mg2+ and to restore Mg2+ uptake to a Mg2+ transport-deficient strain of S. typhimurium. The predicted amino acid sequence of MgtC showed no similarity to any other known protein. In contrast, the predicted sequence of MgtB indicated that it is a member of the family of cation transport P-type ATPases. Strikingly, however, MgtB was significantly more similar to eukaryotic Ca2(+)-ATPases than to prokaryotic P-type ATPases or other classes of eukaryotic P-type ATPases such as the Na+,K(+)-ATPase. MgtB is most closely related to Ca2(+)-ATPases of mammalian sarcoplasmic reticulum and yeast. A number of features of the Ca2(+)-ATPases thought to be important for cation transduction across the membrane are present in MgtB but not in other prokaryotic members of this enzyme family. Unlike the Ca2(+)-ATPases, however, which mediate efflux of cation from the cytosol, MgtB mediates influx of cation into the cytosol."

In this report, we have compared beta 1-6GlcNAc branching of core O- and N-linked oligosaccharides in three experimental models of malignancy, namely (a) rat2 fibroblasts and their malignant T24H-ras-transfected counterpart; (b) benign SP1 mammary carcinoma cells and two metastic sublines of SP1; and (c) the metastatic MDAY-D2 lymphoma cell line and its poorly metastatic glycosylation mutant KBL-1. In addition to the previously reported increase in GlcNAc-transferase V activity, UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 1-3GalNAc alpha-R (GlcNAc to GalNAc) beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core 2 GlcNAc-transferase, EC 2.4.1.102) activity was found to be elevated by 70% in the malignant rat2 and SP1 cell lines while several other glycosyltransferase activities were not significantly different. The action of core 2 GlcNAc-transferase followed by beta 1-4Gal-transferase provides an N-acetyllactosamine antenna that can be extended with polylactosamine (i.e. repeating Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3) provided UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta-R beta 1-3GlcNAc-transferase (GlcNAc-transferase) (i)) activity is present. Polylactosamine content in microsomal membrane glycoproteins was quantitated by labeling the GlcNAc termini resulting from the action of Escherichia freundii endo-beta-galactosidase with bovine galactosyltransferase/UDP-[3H] Gal. Glycopeptidase F- sensitive and -insensitive fractions were measured to assess the N- and O-linked components. In the SP1 tumor model, the metastatic sublines showed increased core 2 GlcNAc-transferase and GlcNAc-transferase V activities but no change in GlcNAc-transferase (i) activity, yet polylactosamine was increased in both O- and N-linked oligosaccharides. In rat2 cells, down-regulation of GlcNAc-transferase (i) following transformation was associated with decreased polyactosamine even though core 2 GlcNAc-transferase and GlcNAc-transferase V were elevated in the cells. Finally, a 3-fold decrease in GlcNAc-transferase V in KBL-1, the glycosylation mutant of MDAY-D2 cells, resulted in complete loss of polylactosamine in N-linked but no change in O-linked polylactosamine content. These results suggest that, provided GlcNAc-transferase (i) is not limiting, the beta 1-6-branching enzymes core 2 GlcNAc-transferase and GlcNAc-transferase V regulate the levels of polyactosamine in O- and N-linked oligosaccharides, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1604280561,"Annexins are primarily intracellular proteins as would be predicted from their lack of hydrophobic signal sequences. However, we now report that the human prostate gland selectively secretes high concentrations of annexin 1 (also called lipocortin 1 and p35) and a proteolytic cleavage product, des1-29-annexin 1, into seminal plasma. Secreted annexin 1 had a blocked amino terminus and was structurally indistinguishable from intracellular annexin 1. Although annexin 1 and the structurally related protein, annexin 4, co-localized to many of the same cells of the ductal epithelium of the prostate, annexin 4 was not secreted. Thus, the secretion of annexin 1 appears to involve a highly selective mechanism that does not involve targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum by a hydrophobic signal sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1496223818,"Neuromodulin (also designated P-57, GAP-43, B-50) is a major presynaptic substrate for protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of neuromodulin decreases its affinity for calmodulin, suggesting that neuromodulin may function to bind and concentrate calmodulin at specific sites within neurons, releasing calmodulin locally in response to phosphorylation by protein kinase C (Alexander, K. A., Cimler, B. M., Meier, K. E., and Storm, D. R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6108-6113). In the present study, we have constructed and characterized several mutant neuromodulins to demonstrate that the amino acid sequence 39-56 is required for calmodulin binding, and that this domain contains the sole in vitro protein kinase C phosphorylation site at serine 41. We also demonstrate that the adjacent phenylalanine 42, interacts hydrophobically with calmodulin. These hydrophobic interactions may be disrupted by the introduction of negative charge at serine 41, and thereby regulate the neuromodulin/calmodulin binding interactions. The sensitivity of the neuromodulin/calmodulin binding interaction to negative charge at serine 41 was determined by substitution of serine 41 with an aspartate or an asparagine residue. The asparagine mutant retained its affinity for calmodulin-Sepharose while the aspartate mutant did not adsorb to calmodulin-Sepharose. We conclude that protein kinase C phosphorylation of neuromodulin abolishes calmodulin binding by introducing negative charges within the calmodulin binding domain at a position adjacent to the phenylalanine."
https://openalex.org/W1965907401,"Activation of p21ras, demonstrated directly as an increase in p21ras-associated GTP, was induced rapidly but transiently by both nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in PC12 cells. The factors activate p21ras to equal extents and with virtually identical time courses. Growth factor-induced p21ras activation and tyrosine phosphorylation have similar time courses and sensitivities to genistein inhibition, indicating that p21ras activation is a result of tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, PC12 mutants lacking the Trk NGF receptor tyrosine kinase also lack NGF-inducible p21ras activation. The protein kinase inhibitor K252a and the methyltransferase inhibitor MTA abolish NGF-induced, but not EGF-induced, p21ras activation--effects correlated with inhibition only of NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. In spite of differences in sensitivity to genistein, MTA, and K252a, EGF- and NGF-stimulated p21ras activation are not additive, implying that they do share at least one step in common."
https://openalex.org/W1597908522,"The COOH terminus of decay accelerating factor (DAF) contains a signal that directs attachment of a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor in a process involving proteolytic removal of 17-31 COOH-terminal residues. Previous work suggested that two elements are required for anchor addition, a COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain (the GPI signal) and an element located NH2-terminal to it, postulated to be the cleavage/attachment site. Using [3H]ethanolamine (a component of the anchor) to tag the COOH terminus, we isolated and sequenced a COOH-terminal tryptic peptide, thereby identifying Ser-319 as the COOH-terminal residue attached to the GPI anchor. This indicates that a 28-residue peptide is removed during processing and localizes the cleavage/attachment site precisely to the region previously shown to be required for anchor attachment (between 10 and 20 residues NH2-terminal to the hydrophobic domain). Since DAF contains multiple cryptic cleavage/attachment sites, we used a GPI-linked human growth hormone-DAF fusion to study the structural requirements for cleavage/attachment. Our results show that while sequences immediately NH2-terminal to the attachment site are not required for anchor addition, deletion of Ser-319 abolishes both anchor attachment and transport to the cell surface. Systematic replacement of the attachment site serine with all possible amino acids indicated that alanine, aspartate, asparagine, glycine, or serine efficiently support GPI anchor attachment while valine and glutamate are partially effective. All other substitutions including cysteine (permitted at the attachment site in other GPI-anchored proteins) abolish both GPI anchor attachment and transport to the cell surface, resulting in accumulation of uncleaved fusion protein in internal compartments (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi). These results support the general rule that the residue at the cleavage/attachment site must be small. Further, addition of a GPI anchor appears to be necessary for transport to the cell surface in transfected COS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2023173148,"The mechanism of interleukin-2 (IL-2) signal transduction was analyzed by use of an inducible B lymphoma. Like normal antigen-activated B lymphocytes, the lymphoma cells respond to IL-2 by proliferating and differentiating into antibody-secreting cells; both responses are blocked by a second interleukin, IL-4. Analyses of the signaling pathway showed that IL-2 stimulated the rapid hydrolysis of an inositol-containing glycolipid to yield two possible second messengers, a myristylated diacylglycerol and an inositol phosphate-glycan. The myristylated diacylglycerol response exhibited the same IL-2 dose dependence as the growth and differentiative responses, and the generation of both hydrolysis products was inhibited by IL-4. These correlations implicate the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol system in the intracellular relay of the IL-2 signal."

Some circumstances, however, were found in infections with a noncytopathic virus in which vaccination caused disease; sensitive parameters included the genetic background of the host, the time or dose of infection, and the constituents of the vaccine. Thus, immunopathologic damage by T cells may be an unwanted consequence of vaccination with the new types of peptide or recombinant vaccines that are being investigated for the human immunodeficiency viruses and other pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2017129666,"The neuronal cell line PC12 undergoes a well-documented morphological and biochemical differentiation when treated with NGF and other growth factors. A hallmark of this growth factor-mediated differentiation is the induction of the growth-associated protein, GAP43. Here we show that a PC12 cell line which is capable of NGF-, bFGF-, and cAMP-mediated neurite outgrowth is deficient in GAP-43 protein and full-length mRNA, as measured by immunocytochemistry, Western blot, Northern blot, and PCR analyses, respectively. We propose that the GAP-43 protein may not be essential for the initial extension and maintenance of neurites induced by these neuritogenic factors; rather, its role may lie predominantly in growth cone function and in the operation of the presynaptic terminal."
https://openalex.org/W2263839663,"The high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a tetrameric structure (alpha beta gamma 2) consisting of non-covalently associated subunits: one IgE-binding alpha chain, one 4-fold membrane spanning beta chain, and two disulfide-linked gamma chains. Here, we have engineered alpha cDNA constructs (alpha trunc) encoding exclusively the leader peptide and the extracellular domain of the alpha subunit. Transfection of human alpha trunc into COS-7 cells resulted in the secretion of soluble IgE-binding polypeptides. By contrast, the polypeptides generated from rat and mouse alpha trunc transfections were sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded even though they appeared to fold properly as judged by their capacity to bind IgE. Stable transfectants with human alpha trunc were obtained from a dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Several clones secreted substantial amounts (0.1 microgram/ml/10(6) cells) of IgE-binding polypeptides. The dissociation rate of bound IgE from this soluble truncated alpha (kappa-1 = 4.9 x 10(-6) s-1 at 25 degrees C) was characteristic of receptors on intact cells. After treatment with tunicamycin, the transfectants secreted unglycosylated 18-kDa polypeptides which could also bind IgE. These unglycosylated products had a tendency to form dimers and higher oligomers which were resistant to treatment by sodium dodecyl sulfate and reducing agents. These data demonstrate unequivocally that the extracellular domain of the alpha subunit is sufficient to mediate high affinity binding of IgE. Furthermore, posttranslational addition of carbohydrates is not required for proper folding and function of the receptor binding site. The truncated human alpha should be a suitable reagent for crystallographic analysis and for detailed analysis of the receptor binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1609692701,"Two different Mr forms of caldesmon as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr values in the range of 120,000-150,000, h-caldesmon and 70,000-80,000, l-caldesmon) have been already identified. h-Caldesmon is predominantly expressed in smooth muscle cells, whereas l-caldesmon widely distributes in non-muscle cells. Most recently, the molecular cloning of h-caldesmon has been reported (Hayashi, K., Kanda, K., Kimizuka, F., Kato, I., and Sobue, K. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 164, 503-511; Bryan, J., Imai, M., Lee, R., Moore, P., Cook, R. G., and Lin, W-G. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13873-13879). The calculated Mr of this protein from its primary structure is 88,743. Here, the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of l-caldesmon have been determined by cloning and sequencing the cDNA from chick brain and compared with those of h-caldesmon. The l-caldesmon cDNA encodes a sequence of 517 amino acids with the calculated Mr of 58,844. Two isoforms of caldesmon conserve the completely identical sequences in the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains except for the insertion of Ala-508 in l-caldesmon. Interestingly, the central repeating sequence of h-caldesmon (residues 201-447) is deleted in the l-caldesmon molecule. The short NH2-terminals of two caldesmons individually show the unique sequences. The results of Northern and Southern blot analyses suggest that two mRNAs (4.8 and 4.1 kilo-bases) coding for caldesmon isoforms may be generated from a single gene by alternative splicing. Using a series of truncated caldesmons expressed in Escherichia coli, the common calmodulin-, tropomyosin-, and actin-binding sites and the minimum regulatory domains, which are involved in the Ca2(+)-dependent regulation of actin-myosin interaction, have been identified within the limited consensus sequences (residues 381-433 for l-caldesmon and residues 636-688 for h-caldesmon)."

https://openalex.org/W1534074292,"Ganglioside GD1a-GalNAc was isolated from Tay-Sachs brain, tritium-labeled in its sphingosine moiety, and its enzymic degradation studied in vitro and in cultured fibroblasts. When offered as micelles, GD1a-GalNAc was almost not hydrolyzed by Hex A or Hex B, while after incorporation of the ganglioside into the outer leaflet of liposomes, the terminal GalNAc residue was rapidly split off by Hex a. In striking contrast to ganglioside GM2, the major glycolipid substrate of Hex A, the enzymic hydrolysis of GD1a-GalNAc was not promoted by the GM2 activator protein, although the activator protein did bind GD1a-GalNAc to form a water-soluble complex. Pathobiochemical studies corroborate these results. After incorporation of [3H]GD1a-GalNAc into cultured skin fibroblasts from healthy subjects and from patients with different variants of GM2 gangliosidosis, its degradation was found to be strongly attenuated in mutant cells with Hex A deficiencies such as variant B (Tay-Sachs disease), variant B1 and variant 0 (Sandhoff disease), while in cells with variant AB (GM2 activator deficiency), its catabolism was blocked only at the level of GM2. In line with these metabolic studies, a normal content of GD1a-GalNAc was found in brains of patients who had succumbed to variant AB of GM2 gangliosidosis whereas in brains from variants B, B1, and 0, its concentration was considerably elevated (up to 19-fold). Together with studies on the enzymic degradation of GM2 derivatives with modifications in the ceramide portion, these results indicate that mainly steric hindrance by adjacent lipid molecules impedes the access of Hex A to membrane-bound GM2 (whose degradation therefore depends on solubilization by the GM2 activator) and in addition that the interaction between the GM2. GM2 activator complex and the enzyme must be highly specific."
https://openalex.org/W1520560572,"Dimerization (oligomerization) of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump increases its activity (Kosk-Kosicka, D., Bzdega, T., and Wawrzynow, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19495-19499). Fluorescence titration on preparations of the purified eosin-labeled human erythrocyte ATPase has been used to monitor the oligomerization process. Calmodulin inhibits oligomerization, although it can bind to the oligomerized enzyme. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the calmodulin-binding domain of the pump stimulate its ATPase activity, indicating the formation of heterooligomers of the peptides with the pump. The oligomerization is prevented by the preincubation of the ATPase with calmodulin. Polyclonal antibodies against the synthetic calmodulin-binding domain inhibit its basal and its calmodulin-stimulated ATPase activity and prevent the formation of the oligomers. ATPase preparations truncated at the COOH terminus with calpain to a fragment of 124 kDa which does not contain the calmodulin-binding domain fail to oligomerize with the intact ATPase. The results show that the calmodulin-binding domain mediates the oligomerization of the Ca2+ pump."

https://openalex.org/W1576751611,"Brush border myosin I from chicken intestinal microvilli is a membrane-associated, single-headed myosin composed of a 119-kDa heavy chain and several calmodulin light chains. We first describe in detail a new procedure for the rapid purification of brush border myosin I in greater than 99% purity with a yield of 40%, significantly higher than for previous methods. The subunit stoichiometry was determined to be 4 calmodulin light chains/myosin I heavy chain by amino acid compositional analysis of the separated subunits. We have studied the effects of Ca2+ and temperature on dissociation of calmodulin from myosin I and on myosin I Mg2(+)-ATPase and contractile activities. At 30 degrees C the actin-activable ATPase activity is stimulated 2-fold at 10-700 microM Ca2+. Dissociation of 1 calmodulin occurs at 25-50 microM Ca2+, but this has no effect on actin activation. The contractile activity of myosin I, expressed as superprecipitation, is greatly enhanced by Ca2+ under conditions in which 1 calmodulin is dissociated. This calmodulin is thus not essential for actin activation or superprecipitation. Myosin I was found to be highly temperature-sensitive, with an increase to 37 degrees C resulting in dissociation of 1 calmodulin at below 10(-7) M Ca2+ and an additional 1.5 calmodulins at 1-10 microM Ca2+. A complete loss of actin activation accompanies the Ca2(+)-induced calmodulin dissociation at 37 degrees C. Our conclusion is that physiological levels of Ca2+ can either stimulate or inhibit the mechanoenzyme activities of brush border myosin I in vitro, with the mode of regulation determined by the number of associated calmodulin light chains."
https://openalex.org/W1974479702,"To understand better early neuronal birth and differentiation in higher vertebrates, we have examined the time when presumptive neurons in the chick embryo first withdraw from the cell cycle and express neurofilaments. Hindbrain reticular neurons arise prior to the definitive streak stage of gastrulation and represent the first neuronal population to be born. The birth of hindbrain reticular neurons and spinal interneurons occurs in a rostrocaudal sequence that closely parallels regression of Hensen's node. More rostral brain stem neurons are born shortly after those in the hindbrain. Neurofilament expression in reticular neuroblasts first occurs by the 7-somite stage, followed by axon outgrowth by the 15-somite stage. When neural plate morphogenesis is inhibited, neurofilament expression occurs on schedule in neurons that are undergoing or have completed terminal mitosis. Our results suggest that the inductive cues governing the birth and initial differentiation of reticular neurons are imparted by gastrulation and early neurulation."

The membrane potential-generating system was dependent upon the lipophilic electron carrier tetracyanoquinodimethane, located within the bilayer, to mediate electron flow from vesicle entrapped ascorbate to external K3Fe(CN)6. Membrane potential formation was followed by the potential-dependent probe oxonol V and was found to rapidly reach a steady-state which lasted at least 90 s. A membrane potential of approximately 254 mV was determined under optimal conditions and ATP hydrolysis by wild-type H(+)-ATPase was inhibited from 34 to 46% under these conditions. In contrast, membrane potential had little effect on pma1-105 mutant enzyme suggesting that it is defective in electrogenic proton translocation. Applied membrane voltage was also found to alter the sensitivity of wild-type enzyme to vanadate at concentrations less than 50 microM. These data suggest a coupling between the charge-transfer and ATP hydrolysis domains and establish a solid basis for future probing of the electrogenic properties of the yeast H(+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1586561849,"The gene encoding the Neurospora mitochondrial large rRNA contains a single group I intron of 2.3 kilobases that is not self-splicing in vitro. We showed previously that the splicing of this intron in vivo and in vitro is dependent on the Neurospora cyt-18 protein, mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. In the present work, we carried out further structural analysis of the intron and constructed mutant derivatives of it in order to identify features that are either required for splicing or prevent it from self-splicing. Previous studies showed that the intron contains a large hairpin structure near the 5' splice site. By mapping RNase III cleavage sites, we identified this hairpin structure as an extended P2 stem. We construct a mini-intron of 388 nucleotides by deleting the 426-amino acid intron open reading frame, most of the 5' intron hairpin, and all of L8. This mini-intron shows the same protein-dependent splicing as the full length intron, but is still not self-splicing. Further deletions, which remove all of P2 or all or part of P4, P6, P7, or P9, inactivate splicing, suggesting that an intact group I intron core structure is required. Strengthening the P1, P10, or P9.0 pairings did not enable the mini-intron to self-splice. Our findings indicate that the inability of the mitochondrial large rRNA intron to self-splice reflects deficiency of a structure or activity required for cleavage at the 5' splice site, either in the intron core itself or in the interaction between the core and the P1 stem."
https://openalex.org/W2145079178,"A water-soluble, highly polar, heat-stable, small molecule has been isolated from cell-free extracts of the halotolerant green alga Dunaliella salina. This compound, soluble inhibitory factor (SIF), when added to in vivo light-activated, thylakoid membrane-bound preparations of the D. salina coupling factor 1 (CF1), causes a rapid inactivation of the ATPase activity. SIF must be in its oxidized form to inactivate the CF1 ATPase and probably functions by oxidizing the reduced form of the light-activated enzyme. SIF has been purified to homogeneity and characterized by UV-visible and IR absorption spectroscopy, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. SIF has five different kinds of nonexchangeable protons and seven different kinds of carbon atoms. Three of the carbon atoms and one proton are part of a heterocyclic (imidazole) ring. One carbon atom is a carbonyl (carboxylic acid). One carbon atom and three protons form a methyl group attached to the aromatic ring. One carbon atom and two protons are a methylene group, and one carbon atom (an alpha-amino carbon) is attached to a single proton. In addition, in its reduced form, SIF contains a thiol group attached to the heterocyclic ring. From high resolution mass spectrometry, the molecular weight of SIF was determined to be 401 (M + H+) and is consistent with the composition being C14H21N6O4S2. The UV absorption of SIF shows a large increase at 240 nm upon reduction. An effective difference extinction coefficient for this absorbance change has been calculated to be 6.84 meq/cm. A comparison of SIF with the oxidized form of ovothiol A (1-N-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine disulfide) shows the two compounds to be identical in all respects. In addition, ovothiol A disulfide is as effective as SIF in inhibiting the light-triggered, CF1 ATPase activity. It is concluded, therefore, that SIF and L-1-N-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine disulfide are identical."
https://openalex.org/W1496287649,"The uptake of [32P]KH2PO4 by Percoll-purified human fibroblast lysosomes at pH 7.0 was investigated to determine if lysosomes contain a transport system recognizing phosphate. Lysosomal phosphate uptake was linear for the first 2 min, attained a steady state by 8-10 min at 37 degrees C, and was not Na+ or K+ dependent. Upon entering lysosomes, [32P]phosphate was rapidly metabolized to trichloroacetic acid-soluble and trichloroacetic acid-insoluble products. After 1-min incubations, 50% of the radioactivity recovered from lysosomes was in the form of inorganic phosphate; and after a 2.5-min incubation, 27% of the radioactivity was recovered as inorganic phosphate. When lysosomes are loaded with radioactivity by incubation with 0.03 mM [32P]KH2PO4 for 25 min and then washed at 4 degrees C, lysosomes fail to release the accumulated radioactivity during a subsequent incubation at 37 degrees C. Lysosomal phosphate uptake gave linear Arrhenius plots (Q10 = 1.8) and was inversely proportional to medium osmolarity. Phosphate uptake was maximal at pH 5-6, half-maximal at pH 7.1, with little transport activity at pH greater than 8, suggesting that the transport system recognizes the monobasic form of phosphate. Lysosomal phosphate uptake is saturable, displaying a Km of 5 microM at pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C. High specificity for phosphate is demonstrated since large concentrations of Na2SO4, NaHCO3, KCl, NaCl, 5'-AMP, or the anion transport inhibitor, 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, have no effect on lysosomal phosphate transport. In contrast, the phosphate analog, arsenate, strongly inhibits lysosomal phosphate uptake in a competitive manner with a Ki of 7 microM. Pyridoxal phosphate, CTP, adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate (AMP-PNP), and glucose 6-phosphate were found to be noncompetitive inhibitors of lysosomal phosphate uptake displaying Ki values of 80-250 microM. When lysosomes are incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, the lysosomal membrane ATPase hydrolyzes the ATP to form inorganic phosphate which then enters lysosomes by this lysosomal phosphate transport route."

Dolichol phosphate liposomes were used as the exogenous substrate, thus avoiding the use of detergents. The formation of both of these intermediates of the dolichol pathway was almost completely inhibited after trypsinization of the microsomes under conditions in which microsomal integrity was maintained as evaluated by determining the latency of mannose-6-phosphatase. Using dolichol [32P]phosphate liposomes, it was shown that trypsinization did not interfere with the binding of liposomes to the microsome, suggesting that the effect of trypsinization was on the GlcNAc-transferases. Although dolichol phosphate liposomes associate with the microsomes during incubation, it was possible by sucrose density centrifugation to separate a population of liposomes which were not bound in this manner. GlcNAc lipids isolated from the free liposomes were shown to contain both the mono-GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 derivatives in proportions similar to those obtained from the microsomes. The possibility of transfer of the GlcNAc lipids from endogenous sources on the microsome to the liposome was examined and shown to play little role in these processes. This study strongly suggests a nonluminal, cytoplasmic orientation of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases concerned with the biosynthesis of the first two intermediates of the dolichol pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1598885361,"Immunological and biochemical data have been used to show that the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum expresses a Ca2+/phospholipid-binding protein related to vertebrate annexins. The Dictyostelium protein (apparent molecular mass 46 kDa) is recognized by an antibody directed against an annexin consensus peptide and exhibits the properties characteristic for annexins, i.e. it interacts in a Ca2(+)-dependent manner with negatively charged phospholipids. Limited proteolysis converts the 46-kDa protein into a 32-kDa derivative which retains the Ca2+/phospholipid-binding properties of the 46-kDa polypeptide. Partial protein sequence data identify the Dictyostelium protein as the typical annexin and indicate that the 46-kDa protein is an annexin VII (synexin) homologue. The identification of an annexin in a simple eucaryote should lead to the introduction of genetic approaches to analyze the physiological role of the annexins."

https://openalex.org/W1483098329,"The human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor (GM-R) is expressed on both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues. Although the receptor has been identified by cross-linking studies as an 84,000-dalton protein, very little is known about its biochemistry. In this report, we describe a soluble binding assay for the human GM-R which allowed us to characterize the receptor complex from various sources, including plasma membranes of placenta, neutrophils, and human myeloid leukemia cell lines. Preparation of membranes as well as solubilization by Triton X-100 and N-octylglucoside resulted in a 5-10-fold lower affinity of the receptor for GM-CSF. The Kd decreased from 20 to 80 pM in intact cells to 200-500 pM in both intact and solubilized membranes. Binding in solution was rapid, specific for GM-CSF, and best fit a one-site model with an approximate Kd of 500 pM. The dissociation rate constant for the soluble GM-R was very similar to that of intact cells (k2 = 0.013 min-1 versus 0.017 min-1, respectively). As expected, solubilized membranes obtained from those cells expressing the highest number of GM-R (neutrophils and dimethyl sulfoxide-induced HL-60 cells; approximately 500-800 sites/cell) possessed the highest concentration of soluble GM-R (approximately 2-3 x 10(8) GM-R/micrograms). Cross-linking of 125I-GM-CSF to soluble GM-R resulted in the appearance of two specifically labeled complexes. A major 110-kDa receptor-ligand complex is found when cross-linking is performed with intact cells; both 110- and 200-kDa species are seen when cross-linking is performed with either intact membranes or soluble GM-R. These studies define methods by which intact GM-R can be solubilized and measured in solution, permitting a more complete biochemical characterization of the intact GM-R complex."
https://openalex.org/W1507452164,"The ArsA protein, the catalytic component of the plasmid-encoded resistance system for removal of the toxic oxyanions arsenite, antimonite, and arsenate from bacterial cells, catalyzes oxyanion-stimulated ATP hydrolysis. Three lines of evidence suggest that the ArsA protein functions as a homodimer. First, the ArsA protein was modified with 5'-p-fluorosulfonyl-benzoyladenosine (FSBA). Antimonite potentiated FSBA inhibition, while ATP or ADP afforded partial protection. ATP and antimonite together provided complete protection, indicating interaction of the anion- and nucleotide-binding sites. The estimated Ki values for FSBA were 0.4 mM in the absence of antimonite and 0.1 mM in the presence of antimonite, suggesting that the binding of antimonite increased the affinity of ArsA protein for FSBA. Incorporation of [14C]FSBA was examined. Extrapolation of the amount of FSBA required to inactivate the protein indicated that 1 mol of FSBA was sufficient to inhibit the activity of 1 mol of ArsA protein in the absence of substrates, while only 0.5 mol was required in the presence of the anionic substrate antimonite. Second, chemical cross-linking of the 63-kDa ArsA protein with N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline resulted in formation of a species approximately twice the size of the monomer in the presence of antimonite but not ATP. Third, determination of the average mass of the ArsA protein in solution by light scattering demonstrated that the average species was 66 kDa in the absence of substrates. In the presence of antimonite the weight average molecular mass increased to a mass in excess of 100 kDa. These results are consistent with the ArsA protein existing in an equilibrium between monomer and dimer, with the equilibrium favoring dimerization upon binding of the anionic substrate. Moreover, total loss of ATPase activity in the half-modified enzyme suggests that the catalytic sites on each monomer must interact."

https://openalex.org/W1514524776,"The forward and reverse rates of the overall reaction catalyzed by the ATP synthase in intact rat heart mitochondria, as measured with 32P, were compared with the rates of two partial steps, as measured with 18O. Such rates have been measured previously, but their relationship to one another has not been determined, nor have the partial reactions been measured in intact mitochondria. The partial steps measured were the rate of medium Pi formation from bound ATP (in state 4 this also equals the rate of medium Pi into bound ATP) and the rate of formation of bound ATP from bound Pi within the catalytic site. The rates of both partial reactions can be measured by 31P NMR analysis of the 18O distribution in Pi and ATP released from the enzyme during incubation of intact mitochondria with highly labeled [18O]Pi. Data were obtained in state 3 and 4 conditions with variation in substrate concentrations, temperature, and mitochondrial membrane electrical potential gradient (delta psi m). Although neither binding nor release of ATP is necessary for phosphate/H2O exchange, in state 4 the rate of incorporation of at least one water oxygen atom into phosphate is approximately twice the rate of the overall reaction rate under a variety of conditions. This can be explained if the release of Pi or ATP at one catalytic site does not occur, unless ATP or Pi is bound at another catalytic site. Such coupling provides strong support for the previously proposed alternating site mechanism. In state 3 slow reversal of ATP synthesis occurs within the mitochondrial matrix and can be detected as incorporation of water oxygen atoms into medium Pi even though medium [32P]ATP does not give rise to 32Pi in state 3. These data can be explained by lack of translocation of ATP from the medium to the mitochondrial matrix. The rate of bound ATP formation from bound Pi at catalytic sites was over twice the rate of the overall reaction in both states 4 and 3. The rate of reaction at the catalytic site is considerably less sensitive to the decrease in membrane potential and the concentration of medium ADP than is the rate of medium ATP formation. This supports the view that the active catalytic site is occluded and proceeds at a rapid rate which is relatively independent of delta psi m and of media substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1554518335,"We have used site-directed mutagenesis to replace histidine 163 of the recA polypeptide with an alanine residue. The new [Ala-163]recA protein catalyzes single-stranded (ss) DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis with a turnover number that is similar to that of the wild-type recA protein. Despite being proficient in ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, the [Ala-163]recA protein is unable to promote the ATP-dependent three-strand exchange reaction under standard reaction conditions, pH 7.5. The [Ala-163]recA protein does exhibit three-strand exchange activity at pH 6.0-7.0, however, and the induction of strand exchange activity at low pH correlates directly with the activation of an ATP-dependent isomerization of the mutant protein. Thus, the [Ala-163]recA protein is functionally similar to our previously described mutant [Asn-160]recA protein (Bryant, F.R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8716-8723; Muench, K.A., and Bryant, F. R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11560-11566). Trypsin proteolysis studies indicate that the [Ala-163]recA and [Asn-160]recA proteins, like the wild-type recA protein, are organized into carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal domains of nearly equal size. According to this structural model, the [Ala-163]recA and [Asn-160]recA mutations may lie in a linker region joining these two domains. We speculate that the [Ala-163]recA and [Asn-160]recA mutations interfere with an ATP-dependent conformational change of the recA protein that perhaps involves a change in the relative orientation of the carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal domains."

https://openalex.org/W1606005716,"Identification and characterization of the Na+/Pi co-transporter in the renal brush-border membrane (BBM) has proved to be difficult in part because of the lack of a specific covalent label. NAD is a competitive inhibitor of Na+/Pi co-transport, and we have explored its potential use as a specific label. We describe the synthesis and use of a highly reactive azido derivative of NAD. This derivative (AB-NAD), like the parent NAD molecule, acts as a competitive inhibitor of Na+/Pi co-transport by isolated BBM vesicles. After photoirradiation, the inhibition changes to noncompetitive, as would be expected if the label was bound covalently. This was confirmed by use of [3H]AB-NAD. Photoirradiation produced a 4-fold increase in acid-stable incorporation of 3H into BBM vesicles compared to controls which were not exposed to light. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed that photoirradiation with [32P]AB-NAD produced labeling of several different protein bands, but almost one-half of the 32P was recovered in two bands corresponding to molecular masses of 97 and 70 kDa. Labeling of these bands was markedly reduced in the presence of Na+ and phosphonoformic acid, a specific inhibitor of Na+/Pi co-transport. Chromatography of solubilized BBM proteins indicated that the protein fraction which is photolabeled by AB-NAD is co-eluted with the protein fraction which exhibits Na(+)-dependent binding of phosphonoformic acid. The 97- and 70-kDa polypeptide bands may contain components of the intact Na+/Pi co-transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1493201863,"Fibronectin is a dimeric glycoprotein (Mr 440,000) involved in many adhesive processes. During blood coagulation it is bound and cross-linked to fibrin. Fibrin binding is achieved by structures (type I repeats) which are homologous to the domain of tissue plasminogen activator. Tissue plasminogen activator also binds to fibrin via the finger domain and additionally via the kringle 2 domain. Fibrin binding of tissue plasminogen activator results in stimulation of its activity and plays a crucial role in fibrinolysis. Since fibronectin might interfere with this binding, we studied the effect of fibronectin on plasmin formation by tissue plasminogen activator. In the absence of fibrin, fibronectin had no effect on plasminogen activation. In the presence of stimulating fibrinogen fragment FCB-2, fibronectin increased the duration of the initial lag phase (= time period until maximally stimulated plasmin formation occurs) and decreased the rate of maximal plasmin formation which occurs after that lag phase mainly by increasing the Michaelis constant (Km). These effects of fibronectin were dose-dependent and were similar with single- and two-chain tissue plasminogen activator. They were also observed with plasmin-pretreated FCB-2. An apparent Ki of 43 micrograms/ml was calculated for the inhibitory effect of fibronectin when plasminogen activation by recombinant single-chain tissue plasminogen activator was studied in the presence of 91 micrograms/ml FCB-2. When a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator mutant lacking the finger domain was used in a system containing FCB-2, no effect of fibronectin was seen, indicating that the inhibitory effect of fibronectin might in fact be due to competition of fibronectin and tissue plasminogen activator for binding to fibrin(ogen) via the finger domain."
