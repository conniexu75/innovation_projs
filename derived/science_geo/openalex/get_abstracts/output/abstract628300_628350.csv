https://openalex.org/W2916879452,"Haralick texture features are common texture descriptors in image analysis. To compute the Haralick features, the image gray-levels are reduced, a process called quantization. The resulting features depend heavily on the quantization step, so Haralick features are not reproducible unless the same quantization is performed. The aim of this work was to develop Haralick features that are invariant to the number of quantization gray-levels. By redefining the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) as a discretized probability density function, it becomes asymptotically invariant to the quantization. The invariant and original features were compared using logistic regression classification to separate two classes based on the texture features. Classifiers trained on the invariant features showed higher accuracies, and had similar performance when training and test images had very different quantizations. In conclusion, using the invariant Haralick features, an image pattern will give the same texture feature values independent of image quantization."
https://openalex.org/W2900999361,"Angiography by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT-A) is a non-invasive retinal imaging modality of recent appearance that allows the visualization of the vascular structure at predefined depths based on the detection of the blood movement through the retinal vasculature. In this way, OCT-A images constitute a suitable scenario to analyze the retinal vascular properties of regions of interest as is the case of the macular area, measuring the characteristics of the foveal vascular and avascular zones. Extracted parameters of this region can be used as prognostic factors that determine if the patient suffers from certain pathologies (such as diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion, among others), indicating the associated pathological degree. The manual extraction of these biomedical parameters is a long, tedious and subjective process, introducing a significant intra and inter-expert variability, which penalizes the utility of the measurements. In addition, the absence of tools that automatically facilitate these calculations encourages the creation of computer-aided diagnosis frameworks that ease the doctor’s work, increasing their productivity and making viable the use of this type of vascular biomarkers. In this work we propose a fully automatic system that identifies and precisely segments the region of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) using a novel ophthalmological image modality as is OCT-A. The system combines different image processing techniques to firstly identify the region where the FAZ is contained and, secondly, proceed with the extraction of its precise contour. The system was validated using a representative set of 213 healthy and diabetic OCT-A images, providing accurate results with the best correlation with the manual measurements of two experts clinician of 0.93 as well as a Jaccard’s index of 0.82 of the best experimental case in the experiments with healthy OCT-A images. The method also provided satisfactory results in diabetic OCT-A images, with a best correlation coefficient with the manual labeling of an expert clinician of 0.93 and a Jaccard’s index of 0.83. This tool provides an accurate FAZ measurement with the desired objectivity and reproducibility, being very useful for the analysis of relevant vascular diseases through the study of the retinal micro-circulation."

We assessed such an association of the gut microbiota in Japanese patients with colorectal adenoma (CRA) or intramucosal CRC using colonoscopy aspirates. We analyzed samples from 81 Japanese patients, including 47 CRA and 24 intramucosal CRC patients, and 10 healthy subjects. Metagenomic analysis of the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was performed. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) method was used to examine microbial dysbiosis, revealing significant differences in bacterial abundances between the healthy controls and CRA or intramucosal CRC patients. In particular, F. varium was statistically more abundant in patients with CRA and intramucosal CRC than in healthy subjects. Here, we present the metagenomic profile of CRA and intramucosal CRC and demonstrate that F. varium is at least partially involved in the pathogenesis of CRA and intramucosal CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2917052108,"Solar energy has become an important renewable energy source for reducing the use of fossil fuels and to mitigate global warming, for which solar collectors constitute a technology that is to be promoted. The use of nanofluids can increase the efficiency of solar into thermal energy conversion in solar collectors. Experimental values for the specific heat, thermal conductivity and viscosity of alumina/water nanofluids are needed to evaluate the influence of the solid content (from 0.25 to 5 v%) and the flow rate on the Reynolds, Nusselt and the heat transfer coefficient. In the laminar flow regime, thermal conductivity enhancement over specific heat decrement is key parameter, and a 2.34% increase in the heat transfer coefficient is theoretically obtained for 1 v% alumina nanofluid. To corroborate the results, experimental tests were run in a flat plate solar collector. A reduction in efficiency from 47% to 41.5% and a decrease in the heat removal factor were obtained using the nanofluid due to the formation of a nanoparticle deposition layer adding an addition thermal resistance to heat transfer. Nanofluids are recommended only if the nanoparticle concentration is high enough to enhance thermal conductivity, but no so high so as to avoid wall deposition."
https://openalex.org/W2915488224,"Many countries, including South Africa, have implemented population-based household surveys to estimate HIV prevalence and the burden of HIV infection. Most household HIV surveys are designed to provide reliable estimates down to only the first subnational geopolitical level which, in South Africa, is composed of nine provinces. However HIV prevalence estimates are needed down to at least the second subnational level in order to better target the delivery of HIV care, treatment and prevention services. The second subnational level in South Africa is composed of 52 districts. Achieving adequate precision at the second subnational level therefore requires either a substantial increase in survey sample size or use of model-based estimation capable of incorporating other pre-existing data. Our purpose is demonstration of the efficacy of relatively simple small-area estimation of HIV prevalence in the 52 districts of South Africa using data from the South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence and Behavior Survey, 2012, district-level HIV prevalence estimates obtained from testing of pregnant women who attended antenatal care (ANC) clinics in 2012, and 2012 demographic data. The best-fitting model included only ANC prevalence and dependency ratio as out-of-survey predictors. Our key finding is that ANC prevalence was the superior auxiliary covariate, and provided substantially improved precision in many district-level estimates of HIV prevalence in the general population. Inclusion of a district-level spatial simultaneously autoregressive covariance structure did not result in improved estimation."
https://openalex.org/W2917587613,"Background The temporal distribution of trauma mortality has been classically described as a trimodal pattern with an immediate, early and late peak. In modern health care systems this time distribution has changed. Methods Data from the TraumaRegister DGU was analysed retrospectively. Between 2002 and 2015, all registered in-hospital deaths with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 16 were evaluated considering time of death, trauma mechanism, injured body area, age distribution, rates of sepsis and multiple organ failure. Pre-hospital and post-discharge trauma deaths were not considered. Results 78 310 severely injured patients were registered, non-survivors constituted 14 816, representing an in-hospital mortality rate of 18.9%. Mean ISS of non-survivors was 36.0±16.0, 66.7% were male, mean age was 59.5±23.5. Within the first hour after admission to hospital, 10.8% of deaths occurred, after 6 hours the percentage increased to 25.5%, after 12 hours 40.0%, after 24 hours 53.2% and within the first 48 hours 61.9%. Mortality showed a constant temporal decrease. Severe head injury (defined by Abbreviated Injury Scale, AIS-Head≥3) was found in 76.4% of non-survivors. Patients with an isolated head injury showed a more distinct decrease in survival rate, which was accentuated in the first days after admission. The correlation of age and time of death showed a proportional increase with age (55-74a). The rate of sepsis and multiple organ failure among non-survivors was 11.5% and 70.1%, respectively. Conclusion In a modern trauma care system, the mortality distribution of severely injured patients has changed its pattern, where especially the third peak is no longer detectable."
https://openalex.org/W2917127475,"Background Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is essential for timely treatment. Machine learning and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) for the diagnosis of brain disorders are explicitly attracting attention in the neuroimaging community. In this paper, we propose a voxel-wise discriminative framework applied to multi-measure resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) that integrates hybrid MVPA and extreme learning machine (ELM) for the automated discrimination of AD and MCI from the cognitive normal (CN) state. Materials and methods We used two rs-fMRI cohorts: the public Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI2) and an in-house Alzheimer’s disease cohort from South Korea, both including individuals with AD, MCI, and normal controls. After extracting three-dimensional (3-D) patterns measuring regional coherence and functional connectivity during the resting state, we performed univariate statistical t-tests to generate a 3-D mask that retained only voxels showing significant changes. Given the initial univariate features, to enhance discriminative patterns, we implemented MVPA feature reduction using support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), in combination with the univariate t-test. Classifications were performed by an ELM, and its efficiency was compared to linear and nonlinear (radial basis function) SVMs. Results The maximal accuracies achieved by the method in the ADNI2 cohort were 98.86% (p<0.001) and 98.57% (p<0.001) for AD and MCI vs. CN, respectively. In the in-house cohort, the same accuracies were 98.70% (p<0.001) and 94.16% (p<0.001). Conclusion From a clinical perspective, combining extreme learning machine and hybrid MVPA applied on concatenations of multiple rs-fMRI biomarkers can potentially assist the clinicians in AD and MCI diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2915246156,"Autophagy targets cellular components for lysosomal-dependent degradation in which the products of degradation may be recycled for protein synthesis and utilized for energy production. Autophagy also plays a critical role in cell homeostasis and the regulation of many physiological and pathological processes and prompts this investigation of new agents to effect abnormal autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 2,5-Dichloro-N-(2-methyl-4-nitrophenyl) benzenesulfonamide (FH535) is a synthetic inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway that exhibits anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effects on different types of cancer cells. The combination of FH535 with sorafenib promotes a synergistic inhibition of HCC and liver cancer stem cell proliferation, mediated in part by the simultaneous disruption of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. We demonstrated that FH535 decreased HCC tumor progression in a mouse xenograft model. For the first time, we showed the inhibitory effect of an FH535 derivative, FH535-N, alone and in combination with sorafenib on HCC cell proliferation. Our study revealed the contributing effect of Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibition by FH535 and its derivative (FH535-N) through disruption of the autophagic flux in HCC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2916114214,"Viral-bacterial coinfections, such as with influenza A virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.p.), are known to cause severe pneumonia. It is well known that the host response has an important role in disease. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is an important immune signaling cytokine responsible for inflammation and has been previously shown to contribute to disease severity in numerous infections. Other studies in mice indicate that IL-1β levels are dramatically elevated during IAV-S.p. coinfection. However, the regulation of IL-1β during coinfection is unknown. Here, we report the NLRP3 inflammasome is the major inflammasome regulating IL-1β activation during coinfection. Furthermore, elevated IL-1β mRNA expression is due to enhanced TLR2-MYD88 signaling, which increases the amount of pro-IL-1β substrate for the inflammasome to process. Finally, NLRP3 and high IL-1β levels were associated with increased bacterial load in the brain. Our results show the NLRP3 inflammasome is not protective during IAV-S.p. coinfection."
https://openalex.org/W2950748604,"Limited health literacy is a barrier to optimal healthcare delivery and outcomes. Current measures requiring patients to self-report limitations are time-consuming and may be considered intrusive by some. This makes widespread classification of patient health literacy challenging. The objective of this study was to develop and validate “literacy profiles” as automated indicators of patients’ health literacy to facilitate a non-intrusive, economic and more comprehensive characterization of health literacy among a health care delivery system’s membership. To this end, three literacy profiles were generated based on natural language processing (combining computational linguistics and machine learning) using a sample of 283,216 secure messages sent from 6,941 patients to their primary care physicians. All patients were participants in Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s DISTANCE Study. Performance of the three literacy profiles were compared against a gold standard of patient self-reported health literacy. Associations were analyzed between each literacy profile and patient demographics, health outcomes and healthcare utilization. T-tests were used for numeric data such as A1C, Charlson comorbidity index and healthcare utilization rates, and chi-square tests for categorical data such as sex, race, poor adherence and severe hypoglycemia. Literacy profiles varied in their test characteristics, with C-statistics ranging from 0.61–0.74. Relations between literacy profiles and health outcomes revealed patterns consistent with previous health literacy research: patients identified via literacy profiles indicative of limited health literacy: (a) were older and more likely of minority status; (b) had poorer medication adherence and glycemic control; and (c) exhibited higher rates of hypoglycemia, comorbidities and healthcare utilization. This represents the first successful attempt to employ natural language processing to estimate health literacy. Literacy profiles can offer an automated and economical way to identify patients with limited health literacy and greater vulnerability to poor health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2916844060,"Setting Community based tuberculosis (TB) prevalence surveys in ten sites across India during 2006–2012 Objective To re-analyze data of recent sub-national surveys using uniform statistical methods and obtain a pooled national level estimate of prevalence of TB. Methods Individuals ≥15 years old were screened by interview for symptoms suggestive of Pulmonary TB (PTB) and history of anti-TB treatment; additional screening by chest radiography was undertaken in five sites. Two sputum specimens were examined by smear and culture among Screen-positives. Prevalence in each site was estimated after imputing missing values to correct for bias introduced by incompleteness of data. In five sites, prevalence was corrected for non-screening by radiography. Pooled prevalence of bacteriologically positive PTB was estimated using Random Effects Model after excluding data from one site. Overall prevalence of TB (all ages, all types) was estimated by adjusting for extra-pulmonary TB and Pediatric TB. Results Of 769290 individuals registered, 715989 were screened by interview and 294532 also by radiography. Sputum specimen were examined from 50 852 individuals. Estimated prevalence of smear positive, culture positive and bacteriologically positive PTB varied between 108.4–428.1, 147.9–429.8 and 170.8–528.4 per 100000 populations in different sites. Pooled estimate of prevalence of bacteriologically positive PTB was 350.0 (260.7, 439.0). Overall prevalence of TB was estimated at 300.7 (223.7–377.5) in 2009, the mid-year of surveys. Prevalence was significantly higher in rural compared to urban areas. Conclusion TB burden continues to be high in India suggesting further strengthening of TB control activities."
https://openalex.org/W2915680633,"Blastocsytis sp. is a protozoan parasite that has been linked to common gastrointestinal illnesses. Metronidazole, the first line therapy, was reported to show frequent inefficacy. Previously, Blastocystis sp. isolated from different population showed varying metronidazole resistance. However, the effect of metronidazole treatment on pathogenic potentials of Blastocystis sp. isolated from different populations, which is known to have different gut environment, is unclear. This study investigates the in vitro effect of metronidazole on the pathogenic potentials of Blastocystis sp. isolated from urban and orang asli individuals. Blastocystis sp. ST 3 isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals were treated with a range of metronidazole concentration. The parasites’ growth characteristics, apoptotic rate, specific protease activity and the ability to proliferate cancer cells were analyzed upon treatment with 0.001 mg/l metronidazole. The study demonstrates that Blastocystis sp. isolates showed increase in the parasite numbers especially the amoebic forms (only in urban isolates) after treating with metronidazole at the concentration of 0.001 mg/ml. High number of cells in post-treated isolates coincided with increase of apoptosis. There was a significant increase in cysteine protease of Blastocystis sp. isolates upon treatment despite the initial predominance of serine protease in asymptomatic isolates. Metronidazole resistant Blastocystis sp. also showed significant increase in cancer cell proliferation. Resistance to metronidazole did not show significant different influence on the pathogenicity between Blastocystis sp. isolated from urban and orang asli individual. However, an increase in parasite numbers, higher amoebic forms, cysteine protease and ability to proliferate cancer cells implicates a pathogenic role. The study provides evidence for the first time, the effect of metronidazole towards enhancing pathogenic potentials in Blastocystis sp. when isolated from different gut environment. This necessitates the need for reassessment of metronidazole treatment modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2915657343,"Introduction Tuberculosis incidence is disproportionately high among people in poverty. Cash transfer programs have become an important strategy in Brazil fight inequalities as part of comprehensive poverty alleviation policies. This study was aimed at assessing the effect of being a beneficiary of a governmental cash transfer program on tuberculosis (TB) treatment cure rates. Methods We conducted a longitudinal database study including people ≥18 years old with confirmed incident TB in Brazil in 2015. We treated missing data with multiple imputation. Poisson regression models with robust variance were carried out to assess the effect of TB determinants on cure rates. The average effect of being beneficiary of cash transfer was estimated by propensity-score matching. Results In 2015, 25,084 women and men diagnosed as new tuberculosis case, of whom 1,714 (6.8%) were beneficiaries of a national cash transfer. Among the total population with pulmonary tuberculosis several determinants were associated with cure rates. However, among the cash transfer group, this association was vanished in males, blacks, region of residence, and people not deprived of their freedom and who smoke tobacco. The average treatment effect of cash transfers on TB cure rates, based on propensity score matching, found that being beneficiary of cash transfer improved TB cure rates by 8% [Coefficient 0.08 (95% confidence interval 0.06–0.11) in subjects with pulmonary TB]. Conclusion Our study suggests that, in Brazil, the effect of cash transfer on the outcome of TB treatment may be achieved by the indirect effect of other determinants. Also, these results suggest the direct effect of being beneficiary of cash transfer on improving TB cure rates."
https://openalex.org/W2915656432,"Agricultural practices often involve tank-mixing and co-application of insecticides with fungicides to control crop pests. However, natural methods relying on biological control agents such as hymenopteran parasitoids have been shown to be highly effective in suppressing crop pest populations. The current body of insecticide risk assessment data accounting for fungicide co-application is very small, the present study being the first to examine this in a parasitoid wasp. Through low-dose exposure to dry residues of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid, we examined its mortal and knockdown effect on Aphelinus abdominalis when co-applied with increasing doses of the fungicide tebuconazole. Both of these acute effects of thiacloprid were synergised (toxicity increased to a greater-than-additive effect) by tebuconazole, resulting in significant mortality from low-dose co-applications of tebuconazole, and significant knockdown even without co-applied tebuconazole, the effect increasing as tebuconazole concentration increased. We show the highly toxic effect that a low dose of thiacloprid imposes on A. abdominalis populations, and a synergistic toxicity when co-applied with low doses of tebuconazole. Our work suggests a need for updating pesticide risk assessment methods, accounting for pesticide mixtures, in order to make these risk assessments more field relevant."
https://openalex.org/W2911120883,"A model has two main aims: predicting the behavior of a physical system and understanding its nature, that is how it works, at some desired level of abstraction. A promising recent approach to model building consists in deriving a Langevin-type stochastic equation from a time series of empirical data. Even if the protocol is based upon the introduction of drift and diffusion terms in stochastic differential equations, its implementation involves subtle conceptual problems and, most importantly, requires some prior theoretical knowledge about the system. Here we apply this approach to the data obtained in a rotational granular diffusion experiment, showing the power of this method and the theoretical issues behind its limits. A crucial point emerged in the dense liquid regime, where the data reveal a complex multiscale scenario with at least one fast and one slow variable. Identifying the latter is a major problem within the Langevin derivation procedure and led us to introduce innovative ideas for its solution."
https://openalex.org/W2916611202,"Chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) in children can cause prolonged hearing loss, which is associated with an increased risk of learning delays and behavioural problems. Dispersal of bacterial pathogens from the nasal passages to the middle ear is implicated in COME. We sought to determine whether there is an association between nasal microbial composition and COME in children.A case-control study of children aged 3 and 4 years was conducted. Cases undergoing placement of tympanostomy tubes for COME were compared to healthy controls. Nasal swabs were collected and a questionnaire was administered. The V1-3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified, and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq.73 children with COME had a lower Shannon diversity index than 105 healthy controls (1.62 [.80] versus 1.88 [.84], respectively; P = .046). The nasal microbiota of cases and controls differed in composition using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (p = 0.002). Children with COME had a higher abundance of otopathogens and lower abundance of commensals including alpha haemolytic Streptococci and Lactococcus. Cluster analysis revealed 4 distinct nasal microbial profiles. Profiles that were Corynebacterium-dominated (aOR 4.18 [95%CI, 1.68-10.39], Streptococcus-dominated (aOR 3.12 [95%CI, 1.08-9.06], or Moraxella-dominated (aOR 4.70 [95%CI, 1.73-12.80] were associated with COME, compared to a more mixed microbial profile when controlling for age, ethnicity, and recent antibiotics use.Children with COME have a less diverse nasal microbial composition with a higher abundance of pathogens, compared to healthy children who have a more mixed bacterial profile with a higher abundance of commensals. Further research is required to determine how nasal microbiota may relate to the pathogenesis or maintenance of COME, and whether modification of the nasal microbiota can prevent or treat children at risk of COME."
https://openalex.org/W2915103978,"Online testing for sexually transmitted infections has a lower unit cost than testing in clinical services and economic analysis has focused on the cost per test and cost per diagnosis in clinics and online. However, online services generate new demand for testing and shift activity between services, requiring system-level analysis to effectively predict cost-effectiveness.Routinely collected, anonymised, retrospective data on sexual health service activity from all specialist services (clinic and online) within an inner London sexual health economy were collated and harmonised to generate a complete dataset of individual level clinic attendances. Clinic activity and diagnoses were coded using nationally standardised codes assigned by clinicians. Costs were taken from locally or regionally agreed sexual health tariffs. The introduction of online services changed patterns of testing. In an inner London sexual health economy, online STI testing increased total number of tests, the total cost of testing and total diagnoses while slightly reducing the average cost per diagnosis. Two years after the introduction of online services 37% of tests in the were provided online and total diagnoses increased. The positivity of online services is generally lower than that in clinics but varies between contexts. Where the positivity ratio between clinic and online is less than the cost ratio, online services will reduce cost per diagnosis. In this analysis, areas with different classifications as urban and rural had different clinic/online positivity ratios changing the cost effectiveness between areas. Even after the introduction of online services, simple STI testing activity continues in clinics and providers should consider online-first options where clinically appropriate.Online services for STI testing are not 'stand alone'. They change STI testing behaviour with impacts on all elements of the sexual health economy. Planning, development and monitoring of such services should reference the dynamic nature of these systems and the role of online services within them."
https://openalex.org/W2915887926,"Two hip quality phenotypes-a hip-extended score assigned by a board certified radiologist and the PennHIP distraction index-were analyzed to estimate genetic parameters and to calculate estimated breeding values used for selecting replacement breeders. Radiographs obtained at 12-18 months of age were available on 5,201 German Shepherd Dogs, 4,987 Labrador Retrievers and 2,308 Golden Retrievers. Obtained by fitting a two-trait model using Bayesian techniques, estimates of heritability for the hip-extended score were 0.76, 0.72, and 0.41 in German Shepherd Dogs, Labrador Retrievers, and Golden Retrievers, respectively, while estimated heritabilities for distraction index were 0.60, 0.66 and 0.59, respectively. Genetic correlations between the two hip quality measures were -0.28 in German Shepherd Dogs, -0.21 in Labrador Retrievers, and -0.29 in Golden Retrievers. Genetic selection for improved hip quality based upon the hip extended score phenotype began in 1980. Among first generation puppies, 34% of 273 German Shepherd Dogs, 55% of 323 Labrador Retrievers, and 43% of 51 Golden Retrievers had an Excellent hip extended score. After 8 generations of selection, mostly based on estimated breeding values derived from the hip extended score, over 93% of 695 German Shepherd Dogs, 94% of 528 Labrador Retrievers, and 87% of 116 Golden Retrievers received an Excellent hip extended score. With respect to PennHIP distraction index values among these same dogs, median values were at or above 0.30 for all 3 breeds meaning that half or more of dogs possessing the Excellent hip-extended-score phenotype remained susceptible to developing the osteoarthritis of canine hip dysplasia. Genetic improvement of the hip-extended-view phenotype to its desired biological endpoint left a surprising proportion of dogs expressing sufficient joint laxity to place them in an osteoarthritis at-risk state as they age. Only by directly applying selection pressure to reduce distraction index was marked reduction in joint laxity noted."
https://openalex.org/W2916358866,"Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different incline-speed combinations, at equal external power outputs, on the mechanics and energetics of the double-poling (DP) technique in cross-country skiing. Methods Fourteen elite male cross-country skiers performed treadmill DP on roller-skis at low, moderate, and high mean external power outputs (Pmean) up a shallow incline (5%, INC5), at which DP is preferred, and up a steep incline (12%, INC12), at which DP is not preferred. Speed was set to produce equal Pmean at both inclines. From recorded kinematics and dynamics, arm power (Parm) and trunk+leg power (PT+L) were derived, as were pole propulsion power (Ppole) and body mechanical energy perpendicular to the treadmill surface (Ebody⊥). Results Over a locomotion cycle, the arms contributed 63% to Pmean at INC5 but surprisingly only 54% at INC12 (P<0.001), with no effect of Pmean (P = 0.312). Thus, the trunk and legs contributed substantially to Pmean both at INC5 (37%) and INC12 (46%). At both inclines, PT+L generation during the swing phase increased approximately linearly with Pmean, which increased Ebody⊥. Within the poling phase, ~30–35% of the body energy which was developed during the preceding swing phase was transferred into propulsive pole power on both inclines. At INC5, the amount of negative PT+L during the poling phase was larger than at INC12, and this difference increased with Pmean. Conclusions The considerable larger amount of negative PT+L during poling at INC5 than at INC12 indicate that the legs and trunk generate more power than ‘necessary’ during the swing phase and thus must absorb more energy during the poling phase. This larger surplus of PT+L at INC5 seems necessary for positioning the body and poles so that high Parm generation can occur in a short time. At INC12, less Parm is generated, probably due to less advantageous working conditions for the arms, related to body and pole positioning. These incline differences seem linked to shorter swing and longer poling times during steep uphill DP, which are due to the increased influence of gravity and slower speed at steep inclines."

This was a retrospective study of children who underwent awake flexible endoscopy, DISE, and adenoidectomy with/without tonsillectomy at the Shanghai Children’s Medical Center between 03/2015 and 12/2016. Tonsillectomy was performed for tonsillar obstruction found by DISE. Adenoidectomy was performed for all children. Cardio-pulmonary coupling (CPC) and oximetry were observed before/after surgery. The study included 126 children: 56 (44.4%) with grade 2 tonsils and 70 (55.6%) with grade 1. Mean age was 5.7±3.2 (range, 2.8–10.4) years and mean BMI of 15.7±5.5 kg/m2. Unexpectedly, DISE showed tonsillar obstruction in 57 (45.2%) children, including 44 (78.6%) with grade 2 tonsils and 13 (18.6%) with grade 1. Therefore, DISE-directed tonsillectomy was performed for 57 patients. There was an improvement in respiratory disturbance index (RDI) and oxygen saturation nadir in the DISE (P = 0.0007, P = 0.037) and control (P = 0.001, P = 0.023) groups 6 months after surgery, but RDI improvement was better in the DISE group compared with controls 1 year after surgery (P = 0.042). DISE is a good way to determine the necessity of tonsillectomy in pediatric OSA patients with small tonsils."
https://openalex.org/W2915241330,"Indirect methods for conducting faunal inventories present great promise, and genomic inventories derived from environmental sources (eDNA) are improving. Invertebrate ingested DNA (iDNA) from terrestrial leeches in the family Haemadipsidae has shown potential for surveying vertebrates and biodiversity monitoring in protected areas. Here we present an initial, and critical, evaluation of the limitations and biases of current iDNA protocols for biodiversity monitoring using both standard and NGS barcoding approaches. Key findings include the need for taxon relevant multi-locus markers and reference databases. In particular, the limitations of available reference databases have profound potential to mislead and bias eDNA and iDNA results if not critically interpreted. Nevertheless, there is great potential for recovery of amplifiable DNA from gut contents of invertebrate museum specimens which may reveal both temporal patterns and cryptic diversity in protected areas with increased efficiency. Our analyses of ingested DNA (iDNA) from both freshly stored and previously collected (legacy) samples of terrestrial leeches successfully identified vertebrates from Myanmar, Australia and Madagascar and indicate the potential to characterize microbial communities, pathogen diversity and interactions at low cost."
https://openalex.org/W2915916359,"Modelling of the development of facial morphology during childhood and adolescence is highly useful in forensic and biomedical practice. However, most studies in this area fail to capture the essence of the face as a three-dimensional structure. The main aims of our present study were (1) to construct ageing trajectories for the female and male face between 7 and 17 years of age and (2) to propose a three-dimensional age progression (age -regression) system focused on real growth-related facial changes. Our approach was based on an assessment of a total of 522 three-dimensional (3D) facial scans of Czech children (39 boys, 48 girls) that were longitudinally studied between the ages of 7 to 12 and 12 to 17 years. Facial surface scans were obtained using a Vectra-3D scanner and evaluated using geometric morphometric methods (CPD-DCA, PCA, Hotelling's T2 tests). We observed very similar growth rates between 7 and 10 years in both sexes, followed by an increase in growth velocity in both sexes, with maxima between 11 and 12 years in girls and 11 to 13 years in boys, which are connected with the different timing of the onset of puberty. Based on these partly different ageing trajectories for girls and boys, we simulated the effects of age progression (age regression) on facial scans. In girls, the mean error was 1.81 mm at 12 years and 1.7 mm at 17 years. In boys, the prediction system was slightly less successful: 2.0 mm at 12 years and 1.94 mm at 17 years. The areas with the greatest deviations between predicted and real facial morphology were not important for facial recognition. Changes of body mass index percentiles in children throughout the observation period had no significant influence on the accuracy of the age progression models for both sexes."
https://openalex.org/W2917158981,"Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were reported to promote the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however its mechanism is uncertain. We previously reported that protein kinase R (PKR) in hepatocytes regulated HCC proliferation. In this study, we focused on the role of PKR in HSCs, and clarified the mechanism of its association with HCC progression. We confirmed the activation of PKR in a human HSC cell line (LX-2 cell). IL-1β is produced from HSCs stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or palmitic acid which are likely activators of PKR in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Production was assessed by real-time PCR and ELISA. C16 and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were used to inhibit PKR in HSCs. The HCC cell line (HepG2 cell) was cultured with HSC conditioning medium to assess HCC progression, which was evaluated by proliferation and scratch assays. Expression of PKR was increased and activated in stimulated HSCs, and IL-1β production was also increased molecular. Key molecules of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway were also upregulated and activated by LPS. Otherwise, PKR inhibition by C16 and PKR siRNA decreased IL-1β production. HCC progression was promoted by HSC-stimulated conditioning medium although it was reduced by the conditioning medium from PKR-inhibited HSCs. Moreover, palmitic acid also upregulated IL-1β expression in HSCs, and conditioning medium from palmitic acid-stimulated HSCs promoted HCC proliferation. Stimulated HSCs by activators of PKR in NASH could play a role in promoting HCC progression through the production of IL-1β, via a mechanism that seems to be dependent on PKR activation."
https://openalex.org/W2917571932,"Life-courses describe people's activities from the cradle to the grave. Because life-courses are typically complex, models are used to simplify their description. The most commonly used model is tripartite, representing lives in subsequent periods of education, work, and retirement. However, researchers criticize this model as limited in the activities considered, overly simplistic in the activity sequence, and blind to variation between life-courses. This article explores working age life-courses, which typically show high diversity. Multichannel sequence and cluster analyses are conducted on people's activities from age 15 to 65. Data stem from the life-history interviews of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, capturing cohorts born before 1945. Findings show that three out of four working age life-courses are in line with the tripartite model. This share is particularly high among men, the cohort born 1935 to 1944, and in Northern and Eastern Europe. In contrast, a considerable share of women spent their working age on homemaking, especially women born before 1935, and those living in Southern Europe. Finally, a smaller number of men spent their working age on paid work, followed by a period of illness or of non-employment. The working age life-course patterns identified are used to develop alternative life-course models. However, for a parsimonious solution, the use of two models suffices. A combination of the tripartite model and the model equating middle age to homemaking captures the lives of more than nine out of ten older Europeans. The prevalence of working age life-course patterns in a population is country-specific, and the country differences align with the welfare regimes. This perspective makes working age life-courses characteristics of a society that can be used to map social inequalities at the macro-level and capture social change over time."
https://openalex.org/W2915329594,"Growing evidence suggests that physical exercise may improve cognitive function in the short- and long-term. Aerobic exercise has been studied most extensively. Preliminary work suggests that resistance training also improves cognitive function, particularly executive function. Conversely, most studies found little dose-effect by intensity. Consequently, cognitive benefits may be elicited, at least in part, by the movement rather than the physical exertion of resistance training. The objective here was to examine and compare acute changes in executive function after resistance training and a loadless movement control among young, healthy adults. Twenty-two young healthy adults (mean age 23.4 years [2.4]; 50% female) completed three conditions, a baseline condition and two experimental conditions (moderate intensity resistance training, loadless movement control). Participants completed a computerized modified Stroop task with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) before and 10, 20, 30, and 40min after each intervention. Outcomes (incongruent and congruent response time, accuracy, EEG P3 amplitude and latency) were analyzed using mixed linear regression models (factors: condition, time, condition*time). There was a main effect of time for Stroop response time (F4,84 = 3.94, p = 0.006 and F4,84 = 10.27, p<0.0001 respectively) and incongruent and congruent P3 amplitude (F4,76 = 4.40, p = 0.003 and F4,76 = 5.09, p = 0.001 respectively). Post-hoc analyses indicated that both incongruent and congruent P3 amplitude were elevated at time points up to and including 40min after the interventions (compared to pre-intervention, p<0.05). Both incongruent and congruent response times were faster at 10min post-intervention than pre-intervention (p<0.04). There was no main effect of condition or interaction between condition and time for either outcome (p≥0.53). Similar improvements in executive function were observed after loadless movement and resistance training, suggesting that movement is at least partially responsible for the benefits to executive function. Future research should continue to probe the influence of movement versus physical exertion in resistance training by including a movement and non-movement control."
https://openalex.org/W2916329115,"Background Patients with cystic fibrosis have to take enzymatic supplements to allow for food digestion. However, an evidence-based method to adjust Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT) is inexistent, and lipid content of meals is used as a rough criterion. Objective In this study, an in vitro digestion model was set up to determine the theoretical optimal dose (TOD) of enzymatic supplement for a selection of foods, which is the dose that allows for maximum lipolysis extent. Methods A static in vitro digestion model was applied to simulate digestion of eight foods covering a wide range of lipid contents. First, the dose of the enzymatic supplement was fixed at 2000 lipase units per gram of fat (LU/g fat) using intestinal pH and bile salt concentration as variables. Second, intestinal pH and bile salt concentrations were fixed and the variable was the dose of the enzymatic supplement. Lipolysis extent was determined by measuring the free fatty acids released from initial triglycerides content of foods after digestion. Results in terms of percentage of lipolysis extent were fitted into a linear-mixed segmented model and the deducted equations were used to predict the TOD to reach 90% of lipolysis in every food. In addition, the effect of intestinal pH and bile salt concentration were investigated. Results The predictive equations obtained for the assessed foods showed that lipolysis was not only dependent on the dose of the enzyme supplement or the lipid content. Moreover, intestinal pH and bile salt concentration had significant effects on lipolysis. Therefore an evidence-based model can be developed taking into account these variables. Conclusions Depending on food characteristics, a specific TOD should be assigned to achieve an optimal digestion extent. This work represents a first step towards an evidence-based method for PERT dosing, which will be applied in an in vivo setting to validate its efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2917401066,"The Juan Fernández Ridge (JFRE) is a vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) located off the coast of central Chile formed by the Juan Fernández Archipelago and a group of seamounts. This ecosystem has unique biological and oceanographic features, characterized by: small geographical units, high degree of endemism with a high degree of connectivity within the system. Two fleets have historically operated in this system: a long term coastal artisanal fishery associated with the Islands, focused mainly on lobster, and a mainland based industrial demersal finfish fishery operating on the seamounts which is currently considered overexploited. The management of these fisheries has been based on a classical single-species approach to determine output controls (industrial fleet) and a mixed management system with formal and informal components (artisanal fleet). There has been growing interest in increasing the exploitation of fisheries, and modernization of the fishing fleet already operating in the JFRE. Under this scenario of increased levels of fishing exploitation and the high level of interrelation of species it might be necessary to understand the impact of these fisheries from a holistic perspective based on a ecosystem-based modeling approach. To address these challenges we developed an Atlantis end-to-end model was configured for this ecosystem. The implemented model has a high degree of skill in representing the observed trends and fluctuations of the JFRE. The model shows that the industrial fishing has a localized impact and the artisanal fisheries have a relatively low impact on the ecosystem, mainly via the lobster fishery. The model indicates that the depletion of large sized lobster has leads to an increase in the population of sea urchins. Although this increase is not sufficient, as yet, to cause substantial flow-on effects to other groups, caution is advised in case extra pressure leads the ecosystem towards a regime shift."

Additional HIV testing approaches may be required to increase testing. HIV self-testing is an additional testing approach, but knowledge on its potential for repeat testing is limited. This study explored repeat HIV testing practices and uptake of HIV self-testing among repeat testers, following exposure to HIV self-testing. HIV testing practices were explored at two time points. During Phase 1, eighty in-depth interviews were conducted among 40 consenting adults, and 30 telephonic contacts were completed during Phase 2. Framework analysis was used to analyse the transcripts from the in-depth interviews. The practice of repeat HIV testing is primarily influenced by HIV status awareness and risk exposure. Thirteen regular testers and one HIV naïve tester at baseline had undergone repeat testing through the use of a traditional testing approach such as HIV counselling and testing as reported in Phase 2. HIV self-testing has a role among repeat testers, but affordability and access are barriers."

Several anti-adhesion agents are currently used, but there is no leading-edge product with excellent adhesion-preventive effects. The purpose of this study was to develop ideal anti-adhesive agents using human-derived acellular dermal matrix (ADM). We developed 5 new biocompatible thermosensitive anti-adhesion barriers (AABs) using micronized human-derived ADM, hyaluronic acid, and temperature-sensitive and biocompatible synthesized polymers. The biocompatibility, anti-adhesion effect, and biodegradability of these AABs were compared with those of commercial thermosensitive anti-adhesion agents. No cytotoxic effects were observed in vitro and in vivo. Animal testing of adhesion resistance confirmed that the adhesion area, strength, and grade of AAB03 were statistically superior to those of the control group. Factors related to adhesion formation, such as lymphocytes, macrophages, microvessels, and collagen fiber density, were observed using specific staining methods; the results confirmed that AAB03 group exhibited significantly lower macrophage counts, microvessel density, and collagen fiber density than the control groups. Furthermore, AAB03 was completely absorbed by 6 weeks. Thus, AAB03 has the potential to be used as a high-performance anti-adhesion agent."
https://openalex.org/W2915996091,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) contributes significant morbidity and mortality among Asians; hence interventions should focus on those most at-risk of progression. However, current end stage renal failure (ESRF) risk stratification tools are complex and not validated in multi-ethnic Asians. We hence aimed to develop an ESRF risk prediction model by taking into account ethnic differences within a fairly homogenous socioeconomic setting and using parameters readily accessible to primary care clinicians managing the vast majority of patients with CKD.We performed a prospective cohort study of 1970 adults with CKD estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73m2 or albuminuria >30 mg/g from the population-based Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study (n = 10,033). Outcome was incident ESRF, ascertained by linkage to the Singapore Renal Registry until 2015.Mean follow up was 8.5 ± 1.8 years and ESRF occurred in 32 individuals (1.6%). ESRF incidence rates were 2.8, 0.8 and 2.6 per 1000 patient years in Malays, Indians and Chinese respectively. The best ESRF prediction model included age, gender, eGFR and albuminuria (calibration χ2 = 0.45, P = 0.93; C-statistic 0.933, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.889-0.978, p = 0.01; AIC 356). Addition of ethnicity improved discrimination marginally (C statistic 0.942, 95% CI 0.903-0.981, p = 0.21). Addition of clinical variables such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia did not improve model performance significantly.We affirmed the utility of commonly available clinical information (age, gender, eGFR and UACR) in prognosticating ESRF for multi-ethnic Asians with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2915950106,"Background and aims Various studies have been previously conducted on the diagnosis of lymphadenopathy as benign or malignant, but the results vary. These studies did not describe the inter-rater agreement on the EUS features of lymphadenopathy. In this study, we evaluate the inter-rater agreement on EUS features and propose EUS diagnostic norms for lymphadenopathy based on inter-rater agreement. Method A total of 68 lymph nodes subjected to EUS-fine needle aspiration (FNA) were reviewed by five endoscopic experts. The EUS features evaluated lymph node size, shape, border, margin, echogenicity, homogeneity, and the hilum of the lymph node. Inter-rater agreement (multi-rater kappa statics) was performed. We established new criteria using results with a high degree of inter-rater agreement from EUS features and compared them with the former criteria. Result There was a moderate agreement on shape, kappa (K) = 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34–0.54), and fair agreement on echogenicity, homogeneity, border, and hilum of the lymph node, K (95% CI) = 0.33 (0.17–0.38), 0.34 (0.26–0.35), 0.22 (0.21–0.31), and 0.22 (0.11–0.26), respectively. This resulted in the establishment of new EUS diagnostic criteria using shape, long axis > 20 mm and short axis > 10 mm. New criteria were superior to old criteria (area under the curve 0.82 vs 0.52, P < 0.001). Conclusion EUS diagnostic criteria for lymphadenopathy based on inter-rater agreement were more accurate than old criteria. This result will be useful for the diagnosis of lymphadenopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2916659159,"Background Population-based cancer registries have treatment information for all patients making them an excellent resource for population-level monitoring. However, specific treatment details, such as drug names, are contained in a free-text format that is difficult to process and summarize. We assessed the accuracy and efficiency of a text-mining algorithm to identify systemic treatments for lung cancer from free-text fields in the California Cancer Registry. Methods The algorithm used Perl regular expressions in SAS 9.4 to search for treatments in 24,845 free-text records associated with 17,310 patients in California diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer between 2012 and 2014. Our algorithm categorized treatments into six groups that align with National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. We compared results to a manual review (gold standard) of the same records. Results Percent agreement ranged from 91.1% to 99.4%. Ranges for other measures were 0.71–0.92 (Kappa), 74.3%-97.3% (sensitivity), 92.4%-99.8% (specificity), 60.4%-96.4% (positive predictive value), and 92.9%-99.9% (negative predictive value). The text-mining algorithm used one-sixth of the time required for manual review. Conclusion SAS-based text mining of free-text data can accurately detect systemic treatments administered to patients and save considerable time compared to manual review, maximizing the utility of the extant information in population-based cancer registries for comparative effectiveness research."
https://openalex.org/W2916737315,"Assistance systems should be able to adapt to individual task-related skills and knowledge. Structural-dimensional analysis of mental representations (SDA-M) is an established method for retrieving human memory structures related to specific activities. For this purpose, SDA-M involves a semi-automatized survey of users (the “split procedure”), which yields data about users’ associations between action representations in long-term memory. Up to now this data about associations has commonly been clustered and visualized by SDA-M software in the form of dendrograms that can be used by human experts as a tool to (manually) assess users’ individual expertise and identify potential issues with respect to predefined action sequences. This article presents new algorithmic approaches for automatizing the process of assessing task-related memory structures based on SDA-M data to predict probable errors in action sequences. This automation enables direct integration into technical systems, e.g. user-adaptive assistance systems. An evaluation study has compared the automatized computational assessments to predictions made by human scholars based on visualizations of SDA-M data. The different algorithms’ outputs matched human experts’ manual assessments in 84% to 86% of the test cases."

The parasite has been shown to co-infect HIV patients and an outbreak in central Spain was reported in the last decade. Therfore, ZVL is a public health problem, dogs being the parasite's reservoir. We have developed a DNA vaccine based on the L. infantum activated protein kinase A receptor (LACK) using different plasmid vectors and vaccinia virus strains as vehicles. Recently, we have generated an antibiotic resistance marker-free plasmid vector called pPAL. Homologous pPAL-LACK prime-boost vaccination protects Beagle dogs as well as a heterologous plasmid-virus regime. For both reasons, pPAL improves safety. IL12 was described to trigger Th1 response through IFN-γ production in infected dogs, being a good candidate for cytokine therapy in conventional treatment-unresponsive dogs. Herein, we report a complete protection study in dogs through inoculation of genes encoding for the p35 and p40 subunits which compose canine IL12 in combination with the LACK gene. A homologous plasmid-plasmid regime using independent pPAL constructs for each gene was inoculated in a 15-day interval. The infectious challenge using L. infantum promastigotes was successful. The outcome was pPAL-LACK vaccine protection suppression by IL12 administration. The important implications of this finding are discussed in the manuscript."

A woman's ability to negotiate safer sex is crucial for her survival and that of her child. Sexual autonomy among East African women is vital to the elimination of the deaths of neonates, infants, and children. The aim of our study was to explore the association of sexual autonomy on neonatal, infant, and child mortality.This was a secondary analysis of demographic health survey (DHS) data on women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in five East African countries: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. Data on our outcome variables neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality which were in binary form was extracted from the database. Sexual autonomy was classified as a composite variable of ""respondent can refuse sex,"" ""respondent can ask partner to use condom,"" and ""if spouse is justified in asking husband to use condom."" Other sociodemographic, maternal, health system and paternal variables were included in the analysis. STATA version 14 was used for analysis. Proportions and frequencies were used to describe the three outcome variables and sociodemographic characteristics. Chi-square tests were used to compare associations between sexual autonomy and categorical variables. Adjusted hazard ratios were used to determine the association between sexual autonomy and independent variables.The sampled women were predominantly urban (75%; n = 5758) and poor (48.7%; n = 3702). A majority of those that experienced mortality (neonatal mortality 53.5%, infant mortality 54.3%, under-five mortality 55.7%) were young (under 20) at the time of their first child's birth while their male partners were older. The multivariate analysis supports the beneficial effects of women's sexual autonomy in East Africa. Women who exercised sexual autonomy experienced significantly lower rates of child mortality at all three stages: neonatal (NHR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.68-0.94, p = 0.006), infant (IHR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72-0.93, p = 0.003), and under-five (UHR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.75-0.94, p = 0.002), net of all other factors. Receiving antenatal care and using contraceptives also contributed significantly to lower child mortality rates.Our findings suggest that sexual autonomy among East African women is an urgent priority that is crucial to the survival of neonates, infants, and children in East Africa. Women should be informed, empowered, and autonomous concerning their reproductive and sexual health."

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) amongst a cohort of jazz dancers, by analyzing its presence in accordance with a number of diagnostic criteria, and to verify potential risk factors for joint hypermobility in jazz dancers. Methods 77 jazz dancers from the Polish Dance Theater were examined (58 female and 19 male). The prevalence of JHS was assessed using the following diagnostic tools: a structured interview, Beighton score, Grahame & Hakim questionnaire, and Sachse’s criteria, in the modified version proposed by Kapandji. Results The prevalence of JHS in this cohort of jazz dancers differed significantly, depending on which criteria were adopted (p = 0.001) with Beighton score, Grahame & Hakim questionnaire, and Sachse’s criteria identifying 64.9%, 74% and 59.7% of the sample as JHS respectively. Hypermobility was significantly more prevalent in women than men (p < 0.05). Conclusions This study demonstrated a significant prevalence of joint hypermobility in jazz dancers and corroborates the findings of other researchers, indicating the need for unified diagnostic criteria for JHS in dancers."

However, studies focusing on the accuracy of BDNF levels to differentiate between these patients and healthy controls (HCs) have been rare. Methods Over a discrete ten-year period, we investigated serum BDNF levels in patients with MDD or SZ and compared them to HCs. Results We found serum BDNF levels in 224 samples with SZ to be lower than those in 390 HCs samples (p = 0.007), but not lower than those in the 273 samples with MDD. Male MDD patients tended to have lower BDNF levels compared to male HCs (p = 0.083). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that BDNF levels were moderately accurate in differentiating male MDD patients and female patients with SZ from HCs (AUC = 0.652 and 0.623, respectively). The most adequate cut-off points for BDNF level were 5.11 ng/ml (sensitivity = 81.1%, specificity = 48.5%) and 5.88 ng/ml (sensitivity = 74.1%, specificity = 57.4%), respectively. Conclusions Our results support that BDNF demonstrated moderate accuracy in distinguishing male patients with MDD and female patients with SZ from HCs.

Quantitative data were extracted from the routine databases to assess performance.Quantitative findings from 2011 to 2013 showed 2,750 specimens from previously treated TB cases were received at the reference laboratory. The number increased year on year, but even in the most recent year was only 61% of that expected. The median and interquartile range of turnaround time in days from specimen reception to results reported for smear microscopy, culture and drug susceptibility testing were 1(1, 1), 61(43, 71) and 129(72, 170) respectively. Contaminated specimens were reported in 3.6% of cases. The qualitative analysis showed the system of sending specimens using postal services was seen to be efficient by participants. However, there were many challenges and significant delays in specimens reaching the reference laboratory associated with lack of funds to transfer specimens, weak form completion, inadequate training and poor supervision. These all adversely affected the implementation of the routine surveillance system.Many issues limit the effectiveness of the routine surveillance system in Tanzania.

https://openalex.org/W2915485464,"It is evident through biology research that, biological neural network could be implemented through two means: by congenital heredity, or by posteriority learning. However, traditionally, artificial neural network, especially the Deep learning Neural Networks (DNNs) are implemented only through exhaustive training and learning. Fixed structure is built, and then parameters are trained through huge amount of data. In this way, there are a lot of redundancies in the implemented artificial neural network. This redundancy not only requires more effort to train the network, but also costs more computing resources when used. In this paper, we proposed a bionic way to implement artificial neural network through construction rather than training and learning. The hierarchy of the neural network is designed according to analysis of the required functionality, and then module design is carried out to form each hierarchy. We choose the Drosophila’s visual neural network as a test case to verify our method’s validation. The results show that the bionic artificial neural network built through our method could work as a bionic compound eye, which can achieve the detection of the object and their movement, and the results are better on some properties, compared with the Drosophila’s biological compound eyes."

However, the most significant preS1/S2 region and its influences on viral markers are unclear.The preS1/S2 HBV regions of 90 patients without antiviral therapy were subjected to deep sequencing and deleted regions influencing viral markers were investigated.From the deletion frequency analysis in each patient, deletions were observed most frequently in the preS2 codon 132-141 region. When the patients were divided into three groups (0-0.1%: n = 27, 0.1%-10%: n = 34, 10-100%: n = 29), based on the deletion frequency, FIB-4 (p < 0.01), HBV DNA (p < 0.01), HBcrAg (p < 0.01) and preS1/S2 start codon mutations (p < 0.01, both) were significantly associated with the deletion. When clinical and viral markers were investigated by multivariate analysis for their association with the deletion, FIB-4 (p < 0.05), HBcrAg (p < 0.05), and preS1 start codon mutation (p < 0.01) were extracted as independent variables. When the influence of the preS codon 132-141deletions on HBsAg and HBcrAg, relative to HBV DNA, was investigated, the HBsAg/HBV DNA ratio was lower (0-10% vs. 10%-100%, p<0.05), while the HBcrAg/HBV DNA rati o was higher (0-0.1% vs. 10%-100%, p<0.05) in the presence of the preS codon 132-141deletions.The preS codon.132-141 deletions have a significant influence on the clinical characteristics and viral markers, even when present as a minor population. Importantly, the preS codon 132-141 deletions have a clear influence on the viral life cycle and pathogenesis."

Seventy-three lineages have not previously been reported. We determined the prevalence of three haemosporidians in the samples. We investigated the influence of the internal environment of the host and environmental variables on the Plasmodium diversity and whether environmental variables may explain spatial variations in the prevalence of Plasmodium. We screened DNA from 509 blood samples from nestlings in 15 African colonies for infection by sequencing the cytochrome b gene of parasites. The molecular phylogenetic analysis was performed using Bayesian methods and including sequences from the MalAvi and GeneBank databases. We found 62 new Plasmodium lineages in a clade with MYCAME02, which is a lineage described in waterbirds and recently identified in birds of prey as Plasmodium paranucleophilum. Two Haemoproteus lineages identified in cattle egret formed a distinct group with Haemoproteus catharti and MYCAMH1 (Haemoproteus spp.). Seven Leucocytozoon lineages found in the cattle egret clustered with Leucocytozoon californicus. We found different Plasmodium diversities among the colonies sampled, demonstrating that the internal environment of the host is not the primary determinant of diversity. A linear mixed-effects multivariate model showed that precipitation was positively associated with Plasmodium diversity when controlling for the effects of temperature, colony composition (mixed and non-mixed species) and country. Moreover, a generalized mixed model showed that temperature was positively associated with the prevalence of Plasmodium when controlling for precipitation, elevation and country. We conclude that the cattle egret is a good model for future haemosporidian studies, as we found a significant number of new lineages in this host, which occupies regions with different climate characteristics where environmental variables exert an influence on the diversity and prevalence of Plasmodium."
https://openalex.org/W2915451809,"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) allows the artificial excitation of nerve fibres by applying electric-current pulses through electrodes on the skin’s surface. This work involves the development of a simulation environment that can be used for studying transcutaneous electrotactile stimulation and its dependence on electrode layout and excitation patterns. Using an eight-electrode array implementation, it is shown how nerves located at different depths and with different orientations respond to specific injected currents, allowing the replication of already reported experimental findings and the creation of new hypotheses about the tactile sensations associated with certain stimulation patterns. The simulation consists of a finite element model of a human finger used to calculate the distribution of the electric potential in the finger tissues neglecting capacitive effects, and a cable model to calculate the excitation/inhibition of action potentials in each nerve."
https://openalex.org/W2915621498,"One of the most striking patterns at the land–ocean interface is the massive increase of chlorophyll-a (CHL) from continental shelves towards the coast, a phenomenon that is classically linked to physical features. Here I propose that the coastal–offshore CHL gradient in a shallow sea has biological origins related to phytoplankton mortality that are neglected in state-of-the-art biogeochemical models. I integrate a trait-based ecosystem model into a modular coupling framework that is applied to the southern North Sea (SNS). The coupled model very well reproduces daily, seasonal and inter-annual (2000-2014) dynamics and meso-scale patterns in macronutrients, zooplankton biomass, and CHL as observed in situ and by remote sensors. Numerical experiments reveal that coast–offshore CHL gradients may predominantly arise from a trophic effect as resolved by an increase in carnivorous grazing towards shallow waters. This carnivory gradient reflects higher near-coast abundance of juvenile fish and benthic filter feeders. Furthermore, the temporal evolution of CHL can be much affected by viral infection as a fast-responding loss process at intermediate to high phytoplankton concentrations. Viral control in the model also prevents excessive and unrealistic blooms during late spring. Herbivores as often only ecological factor considered for explaining the spatio-temporal phytoplankton distribution are in this study supplemented by pathogens as well as pelagic and benthic carnivores as powerful agents, which are barely represented in current modeling but can mediate physical drivers of coastal ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2917465139,"Relatively little is known about the ease or difficulty with which women decide to have an abortion, and most research uses single-item measurements. We used a mixed methods approach to combine data from the Dutch Abortion and Mental Health Study (DAMHS, n = 325) with data from a qualitative study about the decision process with a small subsample (n = 69) of the DAMHS study. We used the findings from the qualitative study to develop the Dimensions of Abortion Decision Difficulty [DADD] scale, and tested this scale among a larger sample of women who took part in the second wave of the cohort study (n = 264). Qualitative analyses revealed six dimensions of decision difficulty. The DADD scale was based on these six dimensions. Results from the DADD scale at follow-up reduced these to four dimensions: (1) unrealistic fears about the abortion and fantasies about the pregnancy; (2) decision conflict; (3) negative abortion attitudes; and (4) general indecisiveness. Decision conflict was the only dimension related to previous mental disorders. The findings suggest that the concept of decision difficulty seems multidimensional, rather than unidimensional. On a clinical level, it could be important to separate the more general fears, attitudes, and indecisiveness from strong decision conflict, because the latter might involve pressure of others, lack of decision ownership, and might be related to previous mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2953006658,"Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems in bacteria and archaea are small genetic elements consisting of the genes coding for an intracellular toxin and an antitoxin that can neutralize this toxin. In various cases, the toxins cleave the mRNA. In this theoretical work we use deterministic and stochastic modeling to explain how toxin-induced cleavage of mRNA in TA systems can lead to excitability, allowing large transient spikes in toxin levels to be triggered. By using a simplified network where secondary complex formation and transcriptional regulation are not included, we show that a two-dimensional, deterministic model captures the origin of such toxin excitations. Moreover, it allows to increase our understanding by examining the dynamics in the phase plane. By systematically comparing the deterministic results with Gillespie simulations we demonstrate that even though the real TA system is intrinsically stochastic, toxin excitations can be accurately described deterministically. A bifurcation analysis of the system shows that the excitable behavior is due to a nearby Hopf bifurcation in the parameter space, where the system becomes oscillatory. The influence of stress is modeled by varying the degradation rate of the antitoxin and the translation rate of the toxin. We find that stress increases the frequency of toxin excitations. The inclusion of secondary complex formation and transcriptional regulation does not fundamentally change the mechanism of toxin excitations. Finally, we show that including growth rate suppression and translational inhibition can lead to longer excitations, and even cause excitations in cases when the system would otherwise be non-excitable. To conclude, the deterministic model used in this work provides a simple and intuitive explanation of toxin excitations in TA systems."
https://openalex.org/W2917773449,"Randomized controlled clinical trials require management effort, involving huge organizational, economic and informatics investments. Information technology offers opportunities to approach clinical trial methodology in new ways. However, there are only a few reports of computerized data and drug management systems.This paper describes a novel software created specifically for the management of a randomized trial of diet and metformin in people with metabolic syndrome (the Me.Me.Me. trial).Me.Me.Me. is an ongoing phase III randomized controlled trial in healthy people with metabolic syndrome to test the hypothesis that comprehensive lifestyle changes and/or metformin can prevent age-related chronic non-communicable diseases. To manage all the phases of the trial, we created a software which is a state pattern machine, user friendly, web-based, able to maintain the correct balance between randomization groups, and structured in various levels of security in order to guarantee the participant's privacy and compliance with the study protocol. The software achieves budget savings: drug management is not based on patients' packs, but on the actual need for drugs according to each participant's ""state"", with strict guidelines for the handling and supply of medication.The trial is ongoing and recruitment will close on August 31, 2018. To date, 11737 bottles of metformin/placebo have been dispensed to 1054 randomized participants, with drug savings of 29.5%.A software which takes into account the ""state"" of participant might be a powerful resource for developing and managing clinical trials, helping avoid poor treatment allocation, and wastage of drugs and money.EUDRACT no. 2012-005427-32.

https://openalex.org/W2917918927,"Pancreatic autoantibodies (AAb) has been associated with a worse pancreas graft survival after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK). However, due to the variable time for AAb to become positive and the lack of early biomarkers suggesting such autoimmune activation, the mechanisms leading ß-cell destruction remain uncertain. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between post-transplant AAb and the functional impairment of the pancreatic ß-cell and also the association of such AAb with inflammation after SPK. In a longitudinal study, we analyzed the impact of post-transplant glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-65) and the insulinoma-associated autoantigen 2 (IA-2) AAb on pancreas graft function. Serum Hb1Ac and C-peptide (C-pep) were longitudinally compared between a group with positive posttransplant AAb (AAb+; n = 40) and another matched group with negative AAb (AAb-; n = 40) until the fifth year following seroconversion. In the cross-sectional analysis, we further evaluated the systemic signatures of inflammation by measuring pro-inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes by flow-cytometry and interleukin 17-A serum levels in 38 SPK recipients and ten healthy controls. In the longitudinal study, patients with AAb+ showed higher levels of Hb1Ac (p<0.001) and lower C-pep levels (p<0.001) compared to those who remained AAb- throughout the follow-up. In the cross-sectional study, AAb+ patients showed a higher percentage of CD14+CD16+ monocytes compared with those with AAb- and the healthy controls (6.70±4.19% versus 4.0±1.84% and 3.44±0.93%; p = 0.026 and 0.009 respectively). Also, CD14+CD16+ monocytes correlated with Hb1Ac and C-pep serum levels. Multivariate logistic regression showed that posttransplant AAb+ was independently associated with a higher percentage of pro-inflammatory monocytes (adjusted-OR 1.59, 95%CI 1.05–2.40, p = 0.027). The group of patients with positive AAb also showed higher levels of IL17A as compared with the other groups (either healthy control or the negative AAb subjects). In conclusion, pancreatic AAb+ after SPK were not only associated with higher Hb1Ac and lower c-peptide serum levels but also with an increased percentage of CD14+CD16+ monocytes and higher levels of circulating IL17-A."
