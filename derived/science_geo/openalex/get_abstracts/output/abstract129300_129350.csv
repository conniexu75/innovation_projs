https://openalex.org/W1511198581,"Capsaicin, the main pungent ingredient in ‘hot’ chilli peppers, elicits a sensation of burning pain by selectively activating sensory neurons that convey information about noxious stimuli to the central nervous system. We have used an expression cloning strategy based on calcium influx to isolate a functional cDNA encoding a capsaicin receptor from sensory neurons. This receptor is a non-selective cation channel that is structurally related to members of the TRP family of ion channels. The cloned capsaicin receptor is also activated by increases in temperature in the noxious range, suggesting that it functions as a transducer of painful thermal stimuli in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2073486807,"In isotropic solution, internuclear dipolar couplings average to zero as a result of rotational diffusion. By dissolving macromolecules in a dilute aqueous nematic discotic liquid-crystalline medium containing widely spaced magnetically oriented particles, a tunable degree of solute alignment with the magnetic field can be created while retaining the high resolution and sensitivity of the regular isotropic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum. Dipolar couplings between 1 H- 1 H, 1 H- 13 C, 1 H- 15 N, and 13 C- 13 C pairs in such an oriented macromolecule no longer average to zero, and are readily measured. Distances and angles derived from dipolar couplings in human ubiquitin are in excellent agreement with its crystal structure. The approach promises to improve the accuracy of structures determined by NMR, and extend the size limit."

https://openalex.org/W1693754698,"The development of characteristic visceral asymmetries along the left–right (LR) axis in an initially bilaterally symmetrical embryo is an essential feature of vertebrate patterning. The allelic mouse mutations inversus viscerum (iv)1,2 and legless (lgl)3,4 produce LR inversion, or situs inversus, in half of live-born homozygotes. This suggests that the iv gene product drives correct LR determination, and in its absence this process is randomized2. These mutations provide tools for studying the development of LR-handed asymmetry and provide mouse models of human lateralization defects. At the molecular level, the normally LR asymmetric expression patterns of nodal5 and lefty6 are randomized in iv/iv embryos, suggesting that iv functions early in the genetic hierarchy of LRspecification. Here we report the positional cloning of an axonemal dynein heavy-chain gene, left/right-dynein (lrd), that is mutated in both lgl and iv. lrd is expressed in the node of the embryo at embryonic day 7.5, consistent with its having a role in LR development7. Our findings indicate that dynein, a microtubule-based motor, is involved in the determination of LR-handed asymmetry and provide insight into the early molecular mechanisms of this process."

https://openalex.org/W2042663178,"Members of the Smad family of intracellular signal transducers are essential for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) to exert its multifunctional effects. After activation of TGF-β receptors, Smad2 and Smad3 become phosphorylated and form heteromeric complexes with Smad4. Thereafter, these activated Smad complexes translocate to the nucleus, where they may direct transcriptional responses. Here we report that TGF-β mediates phosphorylation of Smad2 at two serine residues in the C terminus,i.e. Ser465 and Ser467, which are phosphorylated in an obligate order; phosphorylation of Ser465 requires that Ser467 be phosphorylated. Transfection of Smad2 with mutation of Ser465 and/or Ser467 to alanine residues into Mv1Lu cells resulted in dominant-negative inhibition of TGF-β signaling. These Smad2 mutants were found to stably interact with an activated TGF-β receptor complex, in contrast to wild-type Smad2, which interacts only transiently. Mutation of Ser465 and Ser467 in Smad2 abrogated complex formation of this mutant with Smad4 and blocked the nuclear accumulation not only of Smad2, but also of Smad4. Thus, heteromeric complex formation of Smad2 with Smad4 is required for nuclear translocation of Smad4. Moreover, peptides from the C terminus of Smad2 containing phosphorylated Ser465 and Ser467 were found to bind Smad4 in vitro, whereas the corresponding unphosphorylated peptides were less effective. Thus, phosphorylated Ser465 and Ser467 in Smad2 may provide a recognition site for interaction with Smad4, and phosphorylation of these sites is a key event in Smad2 activation.

The cellular effects of this pleiotropic factor are exerted by ligand-induced hetero-oligomerization of two distantly related type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors, TβR-I and TβR-II, respectively (2Lin H.Y.

TGF-β forms part of a large family of structurally related proteins, which includes activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) that signal in a similar fashion, each employing distinct complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors (2Lin H.Y.

Different Smad proteins specify different responses using functional assays in Xenopus. Whereas Smad1 induces ventral mesoderm, a BMP-like response, Smad2 induces dorsal mesoderm, an activin/TGF-β-like response (22Graff J.M. Bansal A. Melton D.A.

Recently, phosphorylation of serine residues located in the C terminus of Smad2 was shown to be important for TGF-β signaling (28Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L.

Here we identify Ser465 and Ser467 as two major ligand-dependent in vivo phosphorylation sites in Smad2 and show that they are involved in the association with Smad4; mutation of these phosphorylation sites abrogates TGF-β-induced signaling. COS-1 cells and mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin. For stable transfection, Mv1Lu cells were transfected with wild-type Smad2 or Smad2 mutants, subcloned in pcDNA3 vector using the calcium phosphate precipitate method as described (37Souchelnytskyi S. ten Dijke P. Mijazono K. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells were selected and cultured in the presence of 100 μg/ml of G-418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Expression plasmids for TβR-I, TβR-II, Smad4, and Smad2 were previously described (29Nakao A. Röijer E. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Stenman G. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. J. Biol.

Mutations and sequences of the exchanged restriction fragments in Smad2 cDNA were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfections were performed using a DEAE-dextran protocol, as described (39Cárcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [32P]Orthophosphate labeling, tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis, and automated Edman degradation were performed as described previously (37Souchelnytskyi S. ten Dijke P. Mijazono K. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In brief, subconfluent cells were labeled in phosphate-free medium containing 0.5% dialyzed FBS, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, and [32P]orthophosphate (1.0 mCi/ml). After stimulation with 10 ng/ml of TGF-β1 for 60 min, the cells were washed and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3V04, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the antisera against Smad2 (SED; Ref. 29Nakao A. Röijer E. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Stenman G. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. J. Biol.

The phosphorylated Smad2 proteins were excised from the filter and digestedin situ with trypsin (modified sequencing grade; Promega). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was done using Hunter thin layer electrophoresis (HTLE-7000; CBS Scientific), essentially as described by Boyle et al. (40Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). First dimension electrophoresis was performed in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid/glacial acid/water; 44:156:1800; v/v/v) for 27 min at 2000 V, and chromatography in the second dimension was performed in isobutyric acid/n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/water (1250:38:96:58:558, v/v/v/v/v). After exposure, phosphopeptides were eluted from the plates in pH 1.9 buffer and lyophilized; aliquots of the samples were then subjected to two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis and automated Edman degradation in parallel. For radiochemical sequencing, the eluted phosphopeptides were coupled to Sequelon-AA membrane (Millipore Corp.) by use of carbodiimide coupling, according to standard procedures as described by the manufacturer, and Edman degradation was performed using an Applied Biosystems sequencer (model 477A). Released phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives from each cycle were spotted onto thin layer chromatography plates. The radioactivity in each spot was quantitated by exposure on a FujiX Bio-Imager. TGF-β1 was iodinated using the chloramine T method according to Froliket al. (41Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking was performed as described previously (42Franzén P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P.

Complexes of Smad2 and TGF-β receptors, cross-linked with 125I-TGF-β, were immunoprecipitated with Smad2 antiserum (SED; Ref. 29Nakao A. Röijer E. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Stenman G.

Gels were dried and exposed on a FujiX Bio-Imager. To determine the expression levels of TβR-I or TβR-II, aliquots of cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, as described previously (42Franzén P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H.

To determine the expression level of Smad2 constructs, aliquots of cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with SED antiserum. Mv1Lu cells were transiently transfected with p3TP-Lux (43Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of Smad2 expression plasmids using the DEAE-dextran method. After transfection, cells were incubated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and then incubated with 0.1% FBS for 5 h, after which TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) was added. Luciferase activity in the cell lysate was measured after 22–24 h using the luciferase assay system (Promega Biotech Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol using an LKB Luminometer (LKB Bromma). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with TβR-I, TβR-II, Smad4 tagged at the N terminus with a Flag epitope, and wild-type Smad2 or Smad2/S465A,S467A mutant using the DEAE-dextran method. After metabolic labeling for 4–6 h with ProMix (Amersham Corp.), cells were treated or not treated with TGF-β1 for 60 min, followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed. Extracts were precleaned with protein A and nonimmune serum and subsequently subjected to a first immunoprecipitation with Smad2-specific antisera (DQQ; Ref. 29Nakao A. Röijer E. Imamura T.

Immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After chilling, samples were diluted 50 times in lysis buffer (see “[32P]orthophosphate Labeling, Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping, Two-dimensional Phosphoamino Acid Analysis, and Automated Edman Degradation”) and treated with iodoacetoamide to neutralize dithiothreitol. The second immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Flag antibodies M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.); immunocomplexed proteins were eluted from protein A beads by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed in a Fuji-X Bio-Imager. Mv1Lu cells stably transfected with wild-type Smad2 or Smad2 mutants were seeded in Lab-Teck chambers; after 24 h, medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 3% FBS, and incubation continued for 15 h. Cells were treated or not treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 60 min, washed with PBS, fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with methanol, and incubated in 2% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were washed and incubated with specific antisera against Smad2 (DQQ) or Smad4 (HPP) (29Nakao A. Röijer E. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Stenman G. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 2896-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (132) Google Scholar) for 16 h at 4 °C. After four subsequent washes in 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, cells were incubated in goat fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Daco; dilution 1:40) for 1 h at room temperature. Then cells were extensively washed in PBS and ethanol, air-dried, and mounted. Immunofluorescence staining was analyzed using an Axiovert 100 microscope (Zeiss). The peptides KKKSSMS-COOH and KKKYTQMGSPSVRCSSMS-COOH were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer (model ABI430A) by Fmoc chemistry. The corresponding peptides with the two most C-terminal serine residues phosphorylated were synthesized using phosphorylated Fmoc serine residue derivatives. The peptides were analyzed by plasma desorption mass spectrometry using an Applied Biosystems Bio Ion 20 instrument. Peptide fractions were freeze-dried and stored under dry conditions. Peptides were coupled to activated CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) through primary amino groups according to the manufacturer's protocol; the three lysines at the N terminus were included to facilitate efficient coupling. The efficiency of coupling was determined by measuring the A 280 (orA 215 for short peptides) of the peptide solution before and after coupling. The coupling efficiencies of all four peptides were nearly 100%. cDNA for Smad proteins were cloned into pGEX vectors (Pharmacia), and fusion proteins were prepared and absorbed essentially as described (44Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 63: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Smad2-derived C-terminal peptides were incubated with GST-Smad fusion proteins in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton (PBS-T) with 0.1% BSA overnight at 4 °C. After washing five times in PBS-T with 0.1% BSA and twice in PBS-T, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with GST antiserum (gift from Aino Ruusala) and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). TGF-β receptor activation leads to phosphorylation of Smad2 on serine and threonine residues (17Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.-C. Bapat B. Gallinger S.

To localize the phosphorylated residues in Smad2, we performed two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Nontransfected as well as Smad2-transfected Mv1Lu cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and subjected to immunoprecipitation with a Smad2 antiserum. In the absence of TGF-β1, Smad2 was only phosphorylated at low stoichiometry; phosphorylation was dramatically enhanced after ligand stimulation (Fig.1 A). The Smad2 phosphoproteins of the experiment shown in Fig. 1 Awere transferred to a membrane, cut out, and subjected to tryptic digestion. Analysis of the two-dimensional maps of32P-labeled phosphopeptides revealed about 16 spots of different intensities (Fig. 1, B–D). In the absence of ligand stimulation, a broad smear (spot 18) and few faint spots were seen. Stimulation by TGF-β1 led to the appearance and induction of multiple spots; in particular, seven highly negatively charged phosphopeptides were seen (spots 5, 6, 6b, 12a, 12b, 12c, and 15). Phosphopeptide maps of endogenous and overexpressed Smad2 in Mv1Lu cells were identical, albeit signal intensity was higher on maps of overexpressed Smad2. Overexpression of Smad2 with TβR-I and TβR-II in COS-1 cells and incubation with ligand also led to stimulation of Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). Tryptic phosphopeptide maps of Smad2 phosphorylated in vivo in these cells revealed a nearly identical pattern as compared with phosphorylated Smad2 from Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 1, E–G). Phosphoamino acid analysis of spots 1–18 revealed that all were phosphorylated on serine residues except for spots 11 and 18 that contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues (data not shown). None of the spots contained phosphotyrosine. To identify the positions of phosphorylated residues in the phosphopeptides, the release of radioactivity upon Edman degradation of peptides extracted from the two-dimensional chromatography plate, was determined. The peptide corresponding to spot 15, which contained only phosphoserine, yielded 32P radioactivity released in the third and fifth cycles, with some trailing in the following cycles, which is characteristic for this method. This indicates that Ser465 and Ser467 in the C terminus of Smad2 were phosphorylated, since the corresponding tryptic peptide is the only one in Smad2 with serine residues in positions 3 and 5 (Fig.2, A and B). The C-terminal tryptic peptide also contained another phosphorylatable amino acid residue, i.e. Ser464. However, radiochemical sequencing and phosphoamino acid analysis did not reveal phosphoserine at position 2 in phosphopeptides with the migration position expected if Ser464 would have been phosphorylated alone or in combination with Ser465 and Ser467. Thus, Ser464 in Smad2 appears not to be phosphorylated in response to TGF-β-stimulation. To confirm that Ser465 and Ser467 are phosphorylation sites in Smad2, these residues and the neighboring Ser464 were mutated to alanine residues singly and in combinations. Analysis of two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps of wild-type and mutant Smad2 from 32P-labeled, TGF-β-stimulated COS-1 cells revealed that spot 15, corresponding to a peptide with Ser465 and Ser467phosphorylated, was not seen in the phosphopeptide map of the Smad2/S465A,S467A mutant (Fig. 2 C). As expected, the phosphopeptide map of the Smad2/S464A mutant contained spot 15; the map of the Smad2/S464A mutant was nearly identical to that of wild-type Smad2, although the intensity of phosphorylation was somewhat lower. Moreover, the phosphopeptide map of the triple Smad2/S464A,S465A,S467A mutant also lacked spot 15 and was identical to that of the Smad2/S465A,S467A mutant. Thus, Ser465 and Ser467 are in vivo phosphorylation sites in Smad2. Since Ser465 and Ser467 are located in close proximity of each other, we examined the possibility that they are phosphorylated sequentially. We characterized the TβR-I-mediated phosphorylation in transfected COS-1 cells of Smad2 mutants in which Ser465 or Ser467 were converted to alanine or aspartic acid residues. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of Smad2/S465A, Smad2/S465D, Smad2/S467A, and Smad2/S467D mutants after co-expression with TGF-β receptors and stimulation with TGF-β showed a loss of spot 15 in all cases. Notably, a new spot appeared in the maps of the Smad2/S465A, Smad2/S465D, and Smad2/S467D mutants but not in the map of the Smad2/S467A"

However, a single 62-kilodalton protein with canonical LysRS activity was purified from Methanococcus maripaludis , and the gene that encodes this protein was cloned. The predicted amino acid sequence of M. maripaludis LysRS is similar to open reading frames of unassigned function in both Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and Methanococcus jannaschii but is unrelated to canonical LysRS proteins reported in eubacteria, eukaryotes, and the crenarchaeote Sulfolobus solfataricus . The presence of amino acid motifs characteristic of the Rossmann dinucleotide-binding domain identifies M. maripaludis LysRS as a class I aminoacyl–tRNA synthetase, in contrast to the known examples of this enzyme, which are class II synthetases. These data question the concept that the classification of aminoacyl–tRNA synthetases does not vary throughout living systems."

A 2.1 Å resolution x-ray structure of the mutant complex showed that the receptor cavity was filled by selected hydrophobic mutations of hGH. Large structural rearrangements occurred in the interface at sites that were distant from the mutations. Such plasticity may be a means for protein-protein interfaces to adapt to mutations as they coevolve."

High level expression of both KAP-HAGT and endogenous KAP mRNA was evident in the kidney of male mice from two independent transgenic lines. Renal expression of the transgene in female mice was undetectable under basal conditions but could be strongly induced by administration of testosterone. Testosterone treatment did not cause a transcriptional induction in any other tissues examined. However, an analysis of six androgen target tissues in males revealed that the transgene was expressed in epididymis. No other extra-renal expression of the transgene was detected. In situ hybridization demonstrated that expression ofHAGT (and KAP) mRNA in males and testosterone-treated females was restricted to proximal tubule epithelial cells in the renal cortex. Although there was no detectable human angiotensinogen protein in plasma, it was evident in the urine, consistent with a pathway of synthesis in proximal tubule cells and release into the tubular lumen.

The intrarenal RAS has been postulated to regulate various aspects of renal function including blood flow, natriuresis, and tubular-glomerular feedback, and may therefore participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension (19Hall J.E. Guyton A.C. Mizelle H.L. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1990; 591: 48-62PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hall J.E. Guyton A.C. Tripodo N.C. Lohmeier T.E. McCaa R.E. Cowley A.W.J. Am. J.

Our current understanding of the relative importance of the intrarenalversus systemic RAS comes largely from pharmacological studies (22Peng Y. Knox F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F40-F46PubMed Google Scholar) which have been limited by the specificity of inhibitors, the ability to deliver agents to specific regions of the kidney, and their differential actions in the kidney and systemic circulation. Indeed, progress in our understanding of the role of the intrarenal RAS has been hampered by the lack of tools that separate the effects of the endocrine (blood borne) RAS from individual tissue RAS. Normally, circulating AGT is derived from the liver where it is expressed at a high level and constitutively released. Transgenic mice containing a human AGT (HAGT) gene construct containing its own endogenous promoter express the transgene in hepatocytes of the liver, but also in PCT cells of the kidney, and in a number of other tissues (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double transgenic mice containing both the HAGT gene and also the human renin gene, encoding the species-specific processing protease for HAGT, are chronically hypertensive (23Merrill D.C.

Clearly, the identification and characterization of a promoter capable of specifically targeting renal PCT cells would lead to the development of a novel mechanism to specifically activate the intrarenal RAS independently of the systemic RAS. The kidney androgen-regulated protein (KAP) was originally identified as an abundant 20,000-Da polypeptide product derived from in vitro translation of mouse kidney RNA (25Toole J.J. Hastie N.D. Held W.A. Cell. 1979; 17: 441-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although the function of the KAP protein remains unknown, it is encoded by a highly abundant 850-bp mRNA which accumulates to 4–5% of the total poly(A) mRNA in kidney of androgen-stimulated mice, suggesting the use of a highly active and efficient promoter (26Catterall J.F. Kontula K.K. Watson C.S. Seppanen P.J. Funkenstein B. Melanitou E. Hickok N.J. Bardin C.W. Janne O.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1986; 42: 71-103PubMed Google Scholar). Androgen treatment causes a 3–4-fold stimulation of KAP mRNA (26Catterall J.F. Kontula K.K. Watson C.S. Seppanen P.J. Funkenstein B. Melanitou E. Hickok N.J. Bardin C.W. Janne O.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1986; 42: 71-103PubMed Google Scholar) and a similar accumulation of angiotensinogen mRNA (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the kidney. In situhybridization studies showed that KAP mRNA is localized in PCT cells of the renal cortex in normal male and testosterone-induced female mice (27Meseguer A. Catterall J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); and its expression is under complex hormonal control involving androgens, estrogens, and pituitary hormones (28Meseguer A. Catterall J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1240-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Meseguer A. Catterall J.F. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1992; 89: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on the cellular localization of KAP mRNA in the kidney and its induction by androgen, we hypothesized that the KAP promoter and regulatory sequences would specifically target expression of theHAGT gene to the renal PCT cells. We show herein that under the control of 1542 bp of the KAP promoter, HAGT gene expression is restricted to renal PCT cells and is strongly induced in female mice in response to androgen treatment. The transgene used herein consists of 1542 bp of the KAP promoter fused to the coding region of the HAGT gene. In the first step of the construction, aSacI to XbaI fragment encoding a portion of the 5′-flanking region of the KAP gene (−1542 to −466) was excised from a λ phage genomic clone (30Niu E.M. Meseguer A. Catterall J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and joined with a PCR amplified fragment encoding DNA from the same XbaI site (−466) to coordinate −1 relative to the start site of transcription. This PCR fragment was engineered to contain a BglII site downstream of the PCR product. The first A in the BglII recognition sequence (AGATCT) became the transcription start site (+1) of the transgene. The resulting SacI to BglII fragment extending from −1542 to +6 was then cloned first into pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) to form the plasmid 1542-KAP-Luc, and then subcloned as a KpnI to HindIII fragment into pBluescript II SK− to form the plasmid 1542-KAP-SK. TheHAGT coding region was cloned from a previously described genomic clone (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a BglII to NheI fragment into the unique BglII and SpeI sites in 1542-KAP-SK to form the plasmid 1542-KAP-HAGT.NheI and SpeI have compatible ends. TheBglII site in HAGT resides within intron I, 70 bp upstream of exon II, and in this construct forms the 5′-untranslated region of the gene. Translation initiation of HAGT starts 4 bp into exon II. All cloning junctions were confirmed by sequence analysis. The transgene segment of the final plasmid was excised by digestion with KpnI and NotI and the transgene segment was purified away from the remainder of the plasmid backbone by agarose gel electrophoresis. The transgene DNA was recovered using the Qia-Quick purification kit (Qiagen) and was microinjected at a concentration of 2 ng/μl in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA made with embryo culture-certified water into one-cell fertilized mouse embryos obtained from superovulated C57BL/6J X SJL/J (B6SJL F2) mice using standard procedures (31Hogan E. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar, 32Sigmund C.D. Hypertension. 1993; 22: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All transgenic mice were heterozygous for the KAP-HAGT construct. Female mice were treated with testosterone by the administration of a 5-mg testosterone pellet designed for continuous release for 21 days (catalog number A-151, Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL). Mice were anesthetized with the inhalation anesthetic metofane and the pellet was implanted subcutaneously in the back and tunneled to the nape of the neck using a 10-gauge trocar. The incision was closed with a 6-0 silk suture and the mice were allowed to recover on a heating pad. The duration of the procedure was less than 5 min. The testosterone treatment was allowed to proceed for 5 days at which time experimental and sham operated control mice were killed. All mice were fed standard mouse chow and water ad libitum. Care of the mice used in the experiments met or exceeded the standards set forth by the National Institutes of Health in their guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. All procedures were approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Iowa. Genomic DNA was purified from tail biopsies and subjected to Southern blot analysis for the identification of founder animals or to PCR analysis for the identification of transgenic offspring (33Sigmund C.D. Jones C.A. Kane C.M. Wu C. Lang J.A. Gross K.W. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To identify transgenic founders, 10 μg of tail genomic DNA was digested withBglII and BamHI and probed with a genomic segment encompassing exon 2 and intron 2 of HAGT (see Fig. 1). A 2.9-kb band was diagnostic of the presence of the transgene. There was no significant cross-reactivity of this probe with mouse genomic DNA. PCR analysis was performed on approximately 10–50 ng of tail DNA using primers specific for HAGT and amplified a 539-bp segment internal to exon 2 as described previously (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue-specific expression studies were performed by Northern blot analysis using: 1) a HAGT cDNA probe derived from exon 2 at nucleotide coordinates 302–840 relative to the start site of transcription (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 2) a KAP cDNA probe derived by cloning a reverse transcriptase-PCR product encompassing coordinates 93–521. The oligonucleotides used to clone the KAP cDNA were 5′-ACTGTGGCTTTCCCCCTGTC-3′ and 5′-CTTCCTCGTTCTTTCTTCTTTG-3′. Both probes were cloned using an AT cloning kit (Invitrogen); and the orientation of each probe in the vector was confirmed by sequence analysis. Single-stranded antisense RNA was generated by SP6 transcription of the HAGT vector and by T7 of the KAP vector as described previously (33Sigmund C.D. Jones C.A. Kane C.M. Wu C. Lang J.A. Gross K.W. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Total tissue RNAs were isolated by homogenization in guanidine isothiocyanate followed by phenol emulsion extraction at pH 4.0 using a modification of the method previously described (34Burson J.M. Aguilera G. Gross K.W. Sigmund C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E260-E267PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Homogenization was scaled up to 2.5 ml to increase RNA yield and quality. To ensure the specific detection ofHAGT and KAP transcripts, Northern blots were treated with 1.0 μg/ml RNase A in 2 × standard saline citrate for 15 min at room temperature. We have previously demonstrated that this procedure removes nonspecific hybridization of single-stranded RNA probes (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Sigmund C.D. Jones C.A. Kane C.M. Wu C. Lang J.A. Gross K.W. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Primer extension was performed using a modification of the procedure previously reported (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1989Google Scholar). A 30-base oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-AAATATCATTTTGCAAAGGGTGAAAGGTGG-3′ was end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. This oligonucleotide was designed antisense to KAP-HAGT mRNA in the 5′-untranslated region so that a 37-base extension would result if transcription was initiated at the major KAP transcriptional start site. The labeled oligonucleotide was purified from a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel, eluted into 0.5 mammonium acetate and 10 mm magnesium acetate, and ethanol precipitated. 50,000 dpm of labeled oligonucleotide was hybridized with 40 μg of total kidney RNA in a total volume of 20 μl containing Sequenase reaction buffer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in a thermal cycler (MJ Research). We used a thermal profile in which the samples were first incubated at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by a gradual ramped cooling cycle to 65 °C over 6 min, incubation at 65 °C for 90 min, followed by a gradual cooling to room temperature at a rate of 1.5 °C/min. The annealing mixture was diluted into avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase buffer containing potassium chloride (provided by the manufacturer) in a volume of 40 μl containing 0.25 mm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, TTP, and 2.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Bethesda Research Laboratories) and incubated at 42 °C for 90 min. The primer extension products were purified by ethanol precipitation and run on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gels. The same end-labeled oligonucleotide was also used to sequence the 1542-KAP-HAGT plasmid DNA using the Sequenase kit using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) for using prelabeled primers. The primer extension products and sequencing reactions were run in adjacent lanes on the same gel. In situ hybridization was used to examine the cellular localization of KAP and KAP-HAGT mRNA in the kidney of transgenic mice. Tissues were removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections were cut 8 μm on a Reichert-Jung cryostat and were hybridized to antisense and sense HAGT or KAP RNA probes labeled as described previously, except that digoxigenin-labeled uridine triphosphate (UTP) (studies performed at the Population Council) or3H-labeled UTP (studies performed in Iowa) was used as a label (17Jones C.A.

No HAGT signal was detected in kidney tissue from non-transgenic mice. The3H-labeled sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Detection of digoxigenin-labeled probes was by enzyme immunoassay and enzyme-catalyzed color reaction using the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Sense and antisense probes were used on adjacent sections from the same tissue block. Mouse and human angiotensinogen protein were determined in plasma as described previously (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay differentiates mouse angiotensinogen from human angiotensinogen on the basis of the species-specificity of the biochemical reaction between renin and angiotensinogen (38Hatae T. Takimoto E. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, transgenic KAP-HAGT and negative control littermates were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. Approximately 0.5 ml of fresh blood was collected from the aorta and placed in chilled tubes and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mmol/liter. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 5 min and 150 μl of plasma was immediately frozen at −80 C. Radioimmunoassays were performed using the RIANEN Angiotensin I 125I-labeled RIA kit (DuPont Co., Billerica, MA) using the directions and reagents supplied by the manufacturer. Plasma samples were thawed in an ice bath and 3 μl of dimercaprol, 3 μl of 8-hydroxyquinoline, and 300 μl of maleate buffer were added to the plasma (all reagents were obtained with the radioimmunoassay kit). Samples were then split into 2 tubes. Tube A was incubated without any further additives and used endogenous mouse renin. Tube B was incubated with 17 μg (3.33 units/mg specific activity) of purified human renin in normal saline (Scripps Laboratories, San Diego, CA). Both samples were incubated at 37 °C. Samples were removed from incubation at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 min. Samples were appropriately diluted with reagent blank so that the radioimmunoassay results were on the linear portion of a standard curve. The amount of angiotensin-I generated at each time point was then obtained by comparison to a standard curve generated each time the assay was performed. The angiotensin-I produced was then plottedversus time and saturation kinetics (due to conversion of all angiotensinogen to angiotensin-I) was observed by 60 min (data not shown). Plasma levels of angiotensinogen were then extrapolated using the 1:1 molar relationship between angiotensin-I and its precursor, angiotensinogen, using the 120-min time point. The amount of human angiotensinogen was calculated by subtracting the total angiotensinogen in tube A (mouse angiotensinogen) from tube B (human plus mouse angiotensinogen). To detect urinary angiotensinogen, the above assay was used except 150 μl of urine replaced the plasma. No other changes were made in the assay protocol. Transgenic mice containing a KAP-HAGT transgene were developed to accomplish two specific goals. The first was to determine if 1542 bp of the KAP promoter would target the expression of a heterologous gene specifically to PCT cells of the kidney. The second and long term goal of these studies is to develop a model to examine the functional importance of the intrarenal RAS by expressingHAGT within the kidney, but not in any other extra-renal tissues. We chose the KAP promoter for these studies by virtue of its kidney-specific expression and because, like angiotensinogen, KAP is expressed in PCT cells and its expression is responsive to androgens. Therefore, expression of HAGT under KAP promoter control would not change the overall cellular expression normally exhibited byAGT in the kidney. Transgenic mice were generated with a construct containing 1542 bp of the KAP promoter fused to a 10.3-kb HAGT genomic clone encompassing exons II, III, IV, and V, the intervening introns, a 70-bp segment derived from the 3′-end of intron I, and the native 3′-end of the HAGT gene containing the poly(A) sites (Fig.1 A). This fusion results in the utilization of DNA normally present in intron I as a 5′-untranslated region. Of 58 live born offspring, 4 transgenic founders containing this construct were identified by both PCR (data not shown) and Southern blot (Fig. 1 B). Three of these founders were successfully bred to establish transgenic lines, two of which, derived from founders 1827/1 (Fig. 1, +1) and 1848/3 (Fig. 1 B, +3), transmitted the transgene to approximately 50% of both males and females, indicating insertion in autosomes. However, the transgene in the third line, derived from founder 1841/1, was transmitted to 100% of males (of 26 tested) but 0% of females (of 15 tested), indicating an insertion into the Y chromosome. This line was discontinued as there was no evidence of transgene expression (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the expression ofHAGT in male and female transgenic mice containing a genomic construct controlled by its own endogenous promoter (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the control of 1.2 kb of its own promoter, HAGT mRNA is expressed at the highest level in liver, at a moderate level in kidney, white adipose tissue, diaphragm, and aorta, and at low levels in heart, brown adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and reproductive tissues (Fig.2). In contrast, under control of the KAP promoter, expression ofHAGT mRNA is evident in kidney, but not in liver, heart, lung, brain, adipose tissue, submandibular gland, spleen, muscle, adrenal gland, or vascular tissue (Fig.3, A and B). This kidney-specific pattern of expression was observed in two independent lines of KAP-HAGT mice, although the level of expression in line 1827/1 (Fig. 3 A) was reproducibly higher than in line 1848/3 (Fig. 3 B). As with the expression of many transgenes, there was no correlation between transgene copy number, which was higher in 1848/3 (Fig. 1), and level of transgene expression, which was higher in 1827/1 (Fig. 3). Importantly, the expression ofHAGT in these mice paralleled the tissue-specific expression of the endogenous KAP mRNA (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Expression of the KAP-HAGTtransgene in male transgenic mice. Northern blots of total tissue RNA from a representative male KAP-HAGT line 1827/1 (A and C) and KAP-HAGT line 1848/3 (B) probed with antisense RNA probes for HAGT(A and B) and endogenous KAP (Panel C).

Exposure time was 1 day.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The level of HAGT mRNA in kidney when driven by its endogenous promoter is approximately 4-fold higher in male mice than in female mice (Fig. 2, compare panel A to B), consistent with the androgen responsiveness reported previously by us (18Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of endogenous KAP mRNA in the kidney is about 4-fold higher in male than in untreated-female mice (Fig.4 B). It is therefore interesting to note that there was essentially no detectable expression of the KAP-HAGT transgene in the kidney of untreated-female mice (Fig. 4 A). This suggests the possibility that the 1542-bp segment of the KAP promoter employed in this construct may have a strong dependence on androgen for expression. To test this directly, female transgenic littermates were either left untreated or were administered a testosterone (T) pellet (9.2 mg/kg/day) for a period of 5 days. The level of endogenous KAP and transgene mRNA was then examined in kidney RNA samples from control male, T-treated female, and control female mice. Representative samples from line 1827/1 are shown in Fig. 4. As expected, T-treatment caused a 3–4-fold induction in endogenous KAP mRNA (Fig. 4 B), consistent with the responsiveness of the KAP promoter to androgens as previously reported (26Catterall J.F. Kontula K.K. Watson C.S. Seppanen P.J. Funkenstein B. Melanitou E. Hickok N.J. Bardin C.W. Janne O.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1986; 42: 71-103PubMed Google Scholar). This induction resulted in an approximately equal level of KAP mRNA in males and T-treated females. This is in stark contrast to the marked induction (estimated to be at least 100-fold) of KAP-HAGT transgene mRNA in the"

This study reports on natural conditions whereby N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA)–mediated plateau potentials were elicited and associated with the onset of locomotion. Reticulospinal neurons responded in a linear fashion to mild skin stimulation. With stronger stimuli, large depolarizing plateaus with spiking activity were elicited and were accompanied by swimming movements. Calcium imaging revealed sustained intracellular calcium rise upon sensory stimulation. Blocking NMDA receptors on RS neurons prevented the plateau potentials as well as the associated rise in intracellular calcium. Thus, the activation of NMDA receptors mediates a switch from sensory-reception mode to a motor command mode in RS neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2334154729,"We have recently shown that analysis of BAT-26, was sufficient to establish the Replication Error status of colorectal tumors and cell lines without the need for matching normal DNA. BAT-26, a poly(A) tract in the 5th intron of the hMSH2 gene, does not present significant size variation either between the alleles of one individual or between alleles of different individuals. In colorectal tumors without defects in the replication error system (RER- phenotype), BAT-26 is also quasi-monomorphic. On the contrary, in RER+ colorectal tumors, BAT-26 shows unstable shortened alleles. In order to see whether this behaviour was specific for BAT-26, or was a more general phenomenon for mononucleotide repeat microsatellites, we analysed eight other mononucleotide repeats. In control individuals (72 samples) and in RER- colorectal tumors and cell lines (55 samples), these microsatellites were polymorphic, dimorphic, quasi-monomorphic or monomorphic, indicating that the quasi-monomorphic nature of BAT-26 was not a general rule. All of them showed a tendency to be shorter in RER+ colorectal tumors and cell lines (19 samples), but only quasi-monomorphic and monomorphic mononucleotide repeats could be used to determine the RER status of tumors without matching normal DNA, although with a lower efficiency than BAT-26 due to either a smaller range of shortening in RER+ tumors or to a larger number of false negative cases."

An epimerase implicated in the generation of heparin/heparan sulfate was previously purified to homogeneity from bovine liver (Campbell, P., Hannesson, H.

Heparin and heparan sulfate are complex sulfated glycosaminoglycans composed of alternating glucosamine and hexuronic acid residues. The two polysaccharides are structurally related but differ in composition, such that heparin is more heavily sulfated and shows a higher ratio of l-iduronic acid (IdceA) 1The abbreviations used are: IdceA,l-iduronic acid; GlcUA, d-glucuronic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. tod-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) units (2Kjellén L.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Heparin is produced by connective tissue-type mast cells, whereas heparan sulfate has a ubiquitous distribution and appears to be expressed by most cell types. The biological roles of heparin and heparan sulfate are presumably largely due to interactions of the polysaccharides with proteins, such as enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors/cytokines, and others (2Kjellén L.

The interactions tend to be more or less selective/specific with regard to carbohydrate structure and thus depend on the amounts and distribution of the various sulfate groups and hexuronic acid units. Notably, IdceA units are believed to generally promote binding of heparin and heparan sulfate chains to proteins, due to the marked conformational flexibility of these residues (6Casu B. Petitou M. Provasoli M. Sinaÿ P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 221-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Heparin and heparan sulfate are synthesized as proteoglycans (for reviews, see Refs. 3Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U.

Heparin: Chemical and Biological Properties and Clinical Applications. Edward Arnold, London1989: 159-189Google Scholar). The process is initiated by glycosylation reactions that generate saccharide sequences composed of alternating GlcUA and GlcNAc units (8Silbert J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3542-3546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) covalently bound to peptide core structures. The resulting (GlcUAβ1,4-GlcNAcα1,4) n disaccharide repeats are modified, probably along with chain elongation, by a series of enzymatic reactions that is initiated byN-deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc units, continues through C5-epimerization of GlcUA to IdceA residues, and is concluded by the incorporation of O-sulfate groups at various positions. TheN-deacetylation/N-sulfation step has a key role in determining the overall extent of modification of the polymer chain since the GlcUA C5-epimerase as well as the variousO-sulfotransferases all depend on the presence ofN-sulfate groups for substrate recognition. While the GlcNAcN-deacetylation and N-sulfation reactions are both catalyzed by the same protein (9Pettersson I. Kusche M. Unger E. Wlad H. Nylund L. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8044-8049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the isolation and molecular cloning of N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases from mouse mastocytoma and rat liver implicated two distinct forms of the enzyme (10Hashimoto Y.

The two enzyme types differ with regard to kinetic properties, with the mastocytoma enzyme being more efficient in introducing N-sulfate groups in the growing polymer (13Cheung W.-f. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A GlcUA C5-epimerase was purified to apparent homogeneity (∼1 million-fold) from bovine liver (1Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J. J. Biol.

Another sample (∼1 μg) was applied to preparative (12%) SDS-polyacrylamide gel and was then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After staining the membrane with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the enzyme band was excised. Half of the material was subjected to direct N-terminal sequence analysis, whereas the remainder was digested with Lys-C (0.0075 unit; Waco) in the presence of 1% reduced Triton X-100, 10% acetonitrile, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The generated peptides were separated on a reverse-phase C4 column, eluted at a flow rate of 100 μl/min with a 6-ml 10–70% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and detected with a Waters Model 990 diode array detector. Selected peptides were then subjected to sequence analysis as described above. Total RNA was isolated from bovine liver by the LiCl/urea/SDS method (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized by incubating ∼5 μg of bovine liver total RNA (denatured at 65 °C for 3 min) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, with 1 unit of RNase inhibitor (Perkin-Elmer), 1 mmeach dNTP, 5 μm random nucleotide hexamer, and 1.25 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Perkin-Elmer). The mixture was kept at 42 °C for 45 min and then at 95 °C for 5 min. Degenerated oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the amino acid sequence determined for one of the internal peptides derived from the purified epimerase (see Table I). Single-stranded bovine liver cDNA was subjected to PCR together with 100 pmol of primers 1 (sense) and 3 (antisense) in a total volume of 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 0.1% Tween 20, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm each dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The reaction products were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. An ∼100-bp band was cut out from the gel and reamplified using the same PCR conditions. After an additional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the product, a 108-bp fragment, was isolated, inserted into a pUC119 plasmid, and sequenced.

Open table in a new tab A bovine lung cDNA library constructed in a λgt10 vector (CLONTECH) was screened with the 108-bp PCR fragment as hybridizing probe. The nitrocellulose filters were prehybridized in 6 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 5 × Denhardt's solution containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon DNA for 2 h at 65 °C. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C in the same solution containing32P-labeled probe for 16–18 h. The filters were washed two times with 2 × SSC and 0.5% SDS and two times with 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at the same temperature. Finally, the cDNA phage library was subjected to PCR amplification using an epimerase cDNA-specific primer (5′-GCTGATTCTTTTCTGTC-3′, antisense) together with λgt10 forward or reverse primers (CLONTECH). cDNA inserts, isolated by preparative agarose gel elctrophoresis (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) afterEcoRI restriction cleavage of recombinant bacteriophage DNA, were subcloned into a pUC119 plasmid. The complete nucleotide sequence was determined independently on both strands using the dideoxy chain termination reaction either with 35S-dATP and the modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or with the ALF™ system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). DNA sequences were compiled and analyzed using the DNASTAR™ program (Lasergene). A peptide corresponding to residues 77–97 of the deduced epimerase amino acid sequence (see “Results”) was chemically synthesized by Åke Engström (Department of Medical and Physiological Chemistry, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden) and was then conjugated to ovalbumin using glutaraldehyde (16Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 78-79Google Scholar). A rabbit was immunized with 240 μg of the peptide conjugates emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. After six booster injections (each with 240 μg of conjugated peptide), blood was collected, and the antiserum was recovered. IgG was isolated from the antiserum by affinity chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and used for immunoblotting. Samples of GlcUA C5-epimerase were separated under denaturing conditions by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™ ECL). ECL immunoblotting was performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). Briefly, the membrane was first treated with blocking agent, then incubated with purified antibody, and finally incubated with the peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody. After adding the ECL reagent, the light emitted by the chemical reaction was detected by exposure to Hyperfilm™ ECL for 30–60 s. Bovine liver and lung total RNA was prepared by the LiCl/urea/SDS method according to Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and mouse mastocytoma total RNA was extracted as described by Chomczynski and Sacci (17Chomczynski P. Sacci N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) from mastocytoma cells established in culture after passage through an ascites stage (18Jacobsson K.-G. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12154-12159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from each tissue (∼20-μg samples) was denatured in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5% formaldehyde, and 20 mm Mops buffer, pH 7.0, at 65 °C for 5 min. The denatured RNA was separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose containing 5% (v/v) formaldehyde and was then transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.). The RNA blot was prehybridized in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) at 65 °C for 1 h and subsequently hybridized in the same solution with a [32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probe of 2460 bp (bp 13–2472 in Fig. 1). The membrane was washed in 2 × SSC and 0.5% SDS at the same temperature for 2 × 15 min and in 0.5 × SSC and 0.5% SDS for 2 × 15 min. The membrane was exposed to Kodak x-ray film at −70 °C for 24 h. The 3-kb GlcUA C5-epimerase clone inserted into a pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) was linearized at the 3′-end by cleavage with XbaI. In vitro translation was carried out with a Linked T7 transcription-translation system (Amersham Corp.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The mRNA generated by incubation of 0.5 μg of linearized plasmid DNA with a T7 polymerase transcription mixture (total volume, 10 μl; 30 °C for 15 min) was mixed with an optimized rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (total volume, 50 μl) and further incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. A sample (5 μl) of the product was subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was directly exposed to Kodak x-ray film. After exposure, the applied protein molecular standards (LMW molecular calibration kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. GlcUA C5-epimerase was expressed using a BacPAK8™ baculovirus expression system (CLONTECH) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Two oligonucleotides, one at the 5′-end of the cDNA clone (5′-GCCACCATGTCCAAGCTGAATTCTCATAGCTATTCCAAAG-3′, sense) and the other at the 3′-end of the coding sequence (5′-CTAGTTGTGCTTTGCCC-3′, antisense), were used to PCR amplify the C5-epimerase cDNA clone. The resulting fragment was cloned into the BacPAK8 vector. Sf9 insect cells, maintained in Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin, were then cotransfected with the C5-epimerase construct along with viral DNA. Control transfections were performed with a β-glucuronidase cDNA construct included in the expression kit and a mouse cDNA coding for the GlcNAcN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase implicated in heparin biosynthesis (12Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cheung W.-f. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Single plaques of each cotransfected recombinant were picked and propagated. Two 60-mm Petri dishes of Sf9 cells were infected by each recombinant virus stock and incubated at 27 °C for 5 days. The cells from one dish were used for total RNA extraction followed by Northern blot analysis, performed as described above. Cells from the other dish were lysed in a buffer of 100 mm KCl, 15 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A. Supernatants of cell lysates as well as conditioned media were analyzed for epimerase activity. Protein contents of the cell lysates were estimated by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar) or by the BCA reagent procedure (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Epimerase activity was assayed by detecting 3H release by using a biphasic liquid scintillation procedure essentially as described by Campbell et al. (1Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (total volume, 55 μl) contained 25 μl of cell lysate or medium, 25 μl of 2 × epimerase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 30 mmEDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100, and 200 mm KCl, pH 7.4), and 5 μl of substrate (10,000 cpm 3H). Alternatively, the reaction mixtures were applied to a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the released 3H in the3H2O form was separated from the polysaccharide substrate. The fractions containing 3H2O were evaporated by lyophilization. The substrate was a chemicallyN-deacetylated and N-sulfated polysaccharide, obtained from Escherichia coli K5 according to the procedure of Campbell et al. (1Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except thatd-[5-3H]glucose was substituted ford-[1-3H]glucose. Enzymatic conversion of d-glucuronic tol-iduronic acid was demonstrated using the metabolically 1-3H-labeled substrate (N-deacetylated andN-sulfated capsular polysaccharide from E. coliK5) and the analytical procedure described by Campbell et al. (1Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A sample (∼20 μg, 200,000 cpm 3H) of the modified polymer was incubated with 250 μl of cell lysate in a total volume of 300 μl of epimerase assay buffer at 37 °C for 6 h. The incubation was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The sample was mixed with 50 μg of carrier heparin and reacted with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (21Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 5: 3932-3942Crossref Scopus (667) Google Scholar), followed by reduction of the products with NaBH4. The resultant hexuronylanhydromannitol disaccharides were recovered by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 200 cm) of Sephadex G-15 in 0.2 m NH4HCO3, lyophilized, and subjected to paper chromatography on Whatman No. 3MM paper in ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (3:1:1). Amino acid sequence data for the ∼52-kDa protein were obtained by digesting highly purified epimerase with lysine-specific protease, followed by separation of the generated peptides on a reverse-phase column. The five most prominent peptides were isolated and subjected to amino acid sequencing (Table I). One of the peptides (peptide 1) was found to correspond to the N-terminal sequence of the purified protein. The sequence of the largest peptide obtained (peptide 5 in Table I) was used to design two sense and one antisense degenerate oligonucleotide primers, as shown in Table I. A DNA probe was produced by PCR using primers 1 and 3 with bovine liver cDNA as template. The resultant ∼100-bp DNA fragment was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reamplified using the same primers, and finally isolated by electrophoresis. The identity of the product was ascertained by “nested” PCR, using primers 2 and 3, which yielded the expected ∼60-bp fragment (data not shown). Moreover, sequencing of the larger (108 bp) DNA fragment gave a deduced amino acid sequence identical to that of the isolated peptide (Table I). The 108-bp PCR product was labeled with [32P]dCTP and used for screening of a bovine lung λgt10 library. One hybridizing clone, containing a 3-kb insert, was identified. Repeated screening of the same library yielded two additional positive clones, both of which were of smaller size. Subsequent sequencing showed both of the latter clones to be contained within the 3-kb species (data not shown). The 3-kb clone was sequenced through both strands and found to contain altogether 3073 bp; an additional 12-bp sequence was added at the 5′-end through characterization of a separate clone obtained by PCR amplification of the phage library (see “Experimental Procedures”). The total cDNA sequence identified, in all 3085 bp, contains an open reading frame from the first in-frame ATG codon, corresponding to 444 amino acid residues (Fig.1). Since no in-frame stop codon is present upstream of the assigned initiating ATG codon, it cannot be excluded that the identified cDNA still lacks the complete 5′-terminal sequence. The coding region (1332 bp) is flanked toward the 3′-end by a larger (1681 bp) noncoding segment. The deduced amino acid sequence corresponds to a 49,905-Da polypeptide. All five peptides isolated after endopeptidase digestion (Table I) were recognized in the primary structure deduced from the cDNA (Fig. 1). One of these peptides (peptide 1) is identical to the N terminus of the isolated liver protein. This peptide was found to match residues 74–86 of the deduced polypeptide sequence. The enzyme isolated from bovine liver thus represents a truncated form of the native protein. Generation of mRNA from an expression vector inserted with the 3-kb cDNA clone followed by incubation of the product with rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine resulted in the formation of a distinct labeled protein with an estimated molecular mass of ∼50 kDa (Fig.2). This product was recognized in immunoblotting (data not shown) by polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 77–97 (see Fig. 1) of the deduced amino acid sequence. The same antibodies also reacted with the isolated ∼52-kDa bovine liver protein (data not shown). These observations establish that the 3-kb cDNA is derived from the transcript that encodes the isolated ∼52-kDa bovine liver protein. The cDNA structure indicates the occurrence of three potentialN-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1). A potential transmembrane region is underlined in Fig. 1. The predicted protein contains two cysteine residues, only one of which occurs in the isolated (truncated) protein. The cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 1–1407, with an added ATG codon at the 5′-end, was cotransfected with baculovirus into Sf9 insect cells. The expressed protein thus is larger, by a 25-amino acid sequence, than the predicted 444-amino acid-long protein (Fig. 1). In two separate experiments, the lysates from cells infected with the same recombinant epimerase virus stock showed >10-fold higher enzyme activities, on a mg of protein basis, than the corresponding fractions from cells infected with control recombinant virus stock (TableII). The conditioned media of cells infected with recombinant epimerase showed 20–30-fold higher enzyme activities than the corresponding fractions from cells infected with control plasmid virus stock. Transfections with cDNA encoding other enzymes, such as a β-glucuronidase or the mouse mastocytoma GlcNAcN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase involved in heparin biosynthesis (12Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not significantly increase the epimerase activity beyond control levels. Notably, the higher3H2O release recorded for control samples as compared with heat-inactivated expressed enzyme (Table II) suggests that the insect cells constitutively produce endogenous C5-epimerase, although the amount of enzyme activity is less than that in mammalian cells (data not shown). Furthermore, isolation of the3H-containing fraction from the C5-labeled polysaccharide substrate after incubation with the recombinant epimerase followed by evaporation of the isolated fraction confirmed that3H2O was indeed formed during incubation (data not shown).Table IIExpression of hexuronyl C5-epimerase in Sf9 cellsConstructEpimerase activityCell lysateMediumcpm/mg/hHexUA2-aHexUA, hexuronyl.

These studies were interpreted to be consistent with the hypothesis that the putative “gating particle” of the CFTR channel resides within the R domain. The first and second NBF of CFTR share sequence similarity in certain conserved regions such as Walker A and Walker B motifs, but the overall amino acid homology between the two NBFs of CFTR is only ∼30%.

Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The use of compounds that alter the ATP hydrolysis cycle of CFTR, such as 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), PPi, and vanadate (VO4), provided evidence that hydrolysis of ATP is not only required for channel opening but also is involved in channel closure from the bursting state (16Hwang T.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20466-20472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it was proposed that ATP hydrolysis at NBF1 initiates a burst of activity and that hydrolysis at NBF2 terminates a burst of open events (15Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This dual regulatory mechanism of the CFTR channel (PKA phosphorylation of the R domain and ATP binding and hydrolysis by the NBFs) requires coordinated interactions among the three intracellular domains: NBF1, R, and NBF2. However, little is known about the functional consequences of such interaction. It has been suggested that the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the two NBFs is sensitive to the degree of R domain phosphorylation (16Hwang T.C. Nagel G. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4698-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), but it is not clear how the phosphorylation-induced conformational change in the R domain is connected with the binding and hydrolysis of ATP by the NBFs, which in turn controls channel opening and closing transitions. To explore the potential interaction between the R domain and the NBFs in the function of the CFTR channel, we compared the single channel properties of the wild type CFTR and its R domain deletion mutant, ΔR(708–835)-CFTR. The wild type and ΔR-CFTR were expressed in HEK 293 cells, from which microsomal membrane vesicles were isolated for single channel studies using the bilayer reconstitution technique. Consistent with the early work by Rich et al. (9Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we found that ΔR-CFTR formed a chloride channel that opens independently of PKA phosphorylation. The ΔR-CFTR channel had open probability approximately one-third that of the wild type CFTR channel, due to fewer, shorter openings, which could not be prolonged by agents that increase burst duration in the wild type channel: AMP-PNP, vanadate, and PPi. Although the pore properties of the ΔR-CFTR channel were comparable with wild type, the addition of exogenous unphosphorylated R domain did not reduce open probability (P o), as it does for the wild type channel. This observation casts doubt upon the hypothesis that the exogenous R domain acts as a gating particle. However, phosphorylated R domain increased the opening rate, but not the burst duration, of the ΔR-CFTR channel and increased P o by 2-fold (20Zhao J. Tasch J. Xie J. Davis P.B. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: A33Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a model for CFTR function that postulates that the R domain interacts with NBF1 in at least two ways. In the unphosphorylated state, it inhibits ATP binding or hydrolysis or inhibits translation of these events into channel openings. In the phosphorylated state, the R domain stimulates either binding or hydrolysis of ATP or stimulates the transduction of the effect into the channel opening at NBF1. The wild type CFTR cDNA was subcloned into an Epstein-Barr virus-based episomal eukaryotic expression vector, pCEP4 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), between theNheI and XhoI restriction sites (Fig.1 A). The mutant gene, ΔR(708–835), which lacks 128 amino acids between 708 and 835, was shuttled from pBluescript into pCEP4 by substituting the corresponding fragment in wild-type pCEP4 with the mutant one between BlpI and PmlI restriction sites. The mutant clone (pCEP4(ΔR(708–835)) was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestions. A human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293) was used for transfection and expression of wild type and mutant CFTR proteins. The cell line contains a vector, pCMV-EBNA, that constitutively expresses the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 gene product and increases the transfection efficiency of Epstein-Barr virus-based vectors. pCEP4(CFTR) and pCEP4(ΔR(708–835)-CFTR) were introduced into the HEK 293 cells by the liposome-based gene transfection method. The detailed procedure has been described elsewhere (12Ma J. Tasch J. Tao T. Zhao J. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells transfected with pCEP4(CFTR) or pCEP4(ΔR(708–835)-CFTR) were grown to confluence in 75-cm2 flasks (usually 48–72 h after transfection). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of ice cold radioimmune precipitation solution (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μm diisopropyl fluorophosphate) and spun at 48,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Monoclonal antibody against human CFTR, either mAb 13-1 (specific for the R domain) or mAb 24-1 (specific for the C terminus) (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), was added to 350 μl of cell lysis supernatant solution and incubated on ice for 90 min. Antibody complexes were then precipitated with 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads by incubating at 4 °C for 30 min on a rocker. The beads were washed with Tris-buffered saline three times, and the bound proteins were solubilized with 20 μl of gel sample buffer (200 mmTris-Cl, pH 6.7, 9% SDS, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and loaded onto a 6% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, probed with monoclonal antibodies (mAb 13–1 or mAb 24–1, diluted 1:250), developed with peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG, and detected by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's recommendation (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.). The R domain was cloned from the cDNA for CFTR by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pBluescript SKII as described previously (12Ma J. Tasch J. Tao T. Zhao J. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Sequence data matched that of exon 13 and 85 base pairs of exon 14 of wild type CFTR. Protein was expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. In the presence of [35S]methionine, the radioactive band on SDS-PAGE autoradiography was of appropriate molecular mass (∼30 kDa). Translation of the protein with nonradioactive amino acids, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot with anti-R domain antibody (mAb 13.1) showed a single band at this molecular mass. The nonradioactive protein, subjected to phosphorylation with exogenous PKA and radioactive ATP, showed a radioactive band that migrates slightly more slowly than unphosphorylated control in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Based on these data, we identified the protein product as exogenous R domain and demonstrated our ability to phosphorylate this protein in vitro under standard conditions, as reported previously (12Ma J.

Every batch of R domain protein was confirmed by Western blot and by [35S]methionine label of a parallel reaction mixture to produce R domain protein. By [35S]methionine labeling and quantitation of radioactivity in the protein product, we determined the concentration of R domain protein in each batch, which ranged from 20 to 60 ng/ml. To test the effect of R domain protein on the CFTR channel, 20 μl of either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated R domain protein was added to the cis (intracellular) chamber. Control was the rabbit reticulocyte lysate mixture with no translated protein or the lysate used to translate the proteins of the brome mosaic virus, one of which is of the same molecular weight as the R domain protein (12Ma J.

The HEK 293 cells transfected with pCEP4(CFTR) or pCEP4(ΔR(708–835)-CFTR) were harvested and homogenized using a combination of hypotonic lysis and Dounce homogenization in the presence of protease inhibitors (5 μm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml benzamidine) (12Ma J.

Microsomal membrane vesicles were isolated after sequential centrifugation at 1,000 × g and 100,000 × g; resuspended in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.2)) at a protein concentration of 3–7 mg/ml; and stored at −75 °C until use. Lipid bilayer membranes were formed across an aperture ∼200 μm in diameter with a lipid mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylserine/cholesterol (6:6:1). The lipids were dissolved in decane at a concentration of 40 mg/ml (12Ma J. Tasch J. Tao T. Zhao J. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Davis P.B. J. Biol.

The recording solutions contained the following: cis(intracellular, 1-ml volume), 200 mm KCl, 2 mmATP, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmHEPES-Tris (pH 7.4); trans (extracellular, 3-ml volume), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4). Unless otherwise indicated, recordings of a single CFTR channel with ΔR(708–835)-CFTR were always performed without PKA present in the recording solution, and those with wild type CFTR were always performed with a 50 unit/ml concentration of PKA catalytic subunit (Promega) present in the cis-solution. Because the agonists for CFTR channel (ATP or PKA) were only present in the cis-solution, this condition selected only CFTR channels that were oriented in the bilayer membrane in the cis-intracellulartrans-extracellular manner. The data presented in this study were obtained with four different preparations of microsomal membrane vesicles isolated from the HEK 293 cells transfected with ΔR(708–835)-CFTR cDNA. The total number of experiments was 130. For the wild type CFTR, the total number of experiments was larger than 400. Single channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200A patch clamp unit (Axon Instruments). Data acquisition and pulse generation were performed with a 486 computer and 1200 Digidata A/D-D/A convertor (Axon Instruments). The currents were filtered at a cut-off frequency of 100 Hz through an eight-pole Bessel filter and sampled at 2.5 ms/point. Single channel data analyses were performed with pClamp software (Axon Instruments). The HEK 293 cells transfected with wild type CFTR cDNA or ΔR(708–835)-CFTR cDNA under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter expressed a large amount of CFTR proteins, detected in a Western blot (Fig.1 A). When microsomal membrane vesicles isolated from these cells transiently expressing the wild type and mutant CFTR proteins were fused with the lipid bilayer membrane, functional chloride channels were routinely detected (Fig.1 B). The wild type CFTR formed a linear conductance chloride channel with slope conductance of 8.2 ± 0.6 pS in 200 mm KCl, the opening of which requires absolutely the presence of ATP (2 mm) and PKA (50 units/ml) in thecis-intracellular solution (12Ma J.

J. 1996; 70: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The wild type CFTR channel exhibits slow kinetics of gating with mean open lifetimes of τo1 = 11.8 ms and τo2 = 189.6 ms (Fig.2 A) and an averageP o of 0.364 ± 0.042 at −80 mV (Fig.2 B). The ΔR(708–835)-CFTR also formed functional chloride channels in the lipid bilayer membrane (Fig. 1 B). These channels were linear with slope conductance of 8.0 ± 0.6 pS. Opening of the ΔR-CFTR channel still requires the hydrolysis of ATP, since AMP-PNP (0.5–4 mm) alone is insufficient to induce opening. Similar to the wild type CFTR, the ΔR-CFTR channel was sensitive to blockade by diphenyl carboxylate added to the extracellular solution (Fig.1 B). The ΔR-CFTR channel remained open, even in the absence of PKA phosphorylation, but with averageP o in 2 mm intracellular ATP of 0.122 ± 0.012, about one-third that of the wild type channel (Fig. 2 A). To test whether PKA phosphorylation can enhance the activity of the ΔR-CFTR channel, experiments were performed with the same channel before and after the addition of PKA to the intracellular solution. As shown in Fig. 3, there were no changes inP o following the addition of PKA (50 unit/ml concentration of the catalytic subunit) in seven paired experiments. To test whether the ΔR-CFTR channel had no response to PKA because it was phosphorylated in vivo by tonic PKA activity, we treated the channel with protein phosphatase 2A, (Promega), which reducedP o of the fully phosphorylated wild type channel from over 0.31 to 0.02 within 6 min in seven paired experiments. There was no change in P o of ΔR-CFTR following protein phosphatase 2A treatment for over 20 min (n = 4). Thus, neither PKA phosphorylation nor PP2A dephosphorylation changed the P o of ΔR-CFTR. This channel was not regulated by phosphorylation. Further single channel data analyses revealed different gating properties between the wild type and ΔR-CFTR channels (Fig. 2). First, the transition rate into the open state was reduced in ΔR-CFTR, since the number of open events was significantly less (compare the plateau phase of the cumulative open time histograms in Fig. 2 B). Second, the distribution of open lifetimes was different (Fig. 2 B). The cumulative open time histogram of the wild type CFTR channel could be fitted with two exponential functions with time constants of 12 and 190 ms, whereas the ΔR-CFTR channel could only be fitted with one exponential function with a time constant of 78 ms. Thus, it appears that the wild type CFTR channel contained two open states and that the ΔR-CFTR channel contained only one open state, which can be resolved at a time resolution of 60 Hz cut-off frequency. Thus, the ΔR-CFTR channel is not regulated by PKA phosphorylation, although a phosphorylation site known to be used in wild type CFTR, S660, remains intact in ΔR-CFTR. Since the P oof ΔR-CFTR channel is low even in the presence of PKA, we postulated that the decreased opening rate of the ΔR-CFTR channel (Fig.2 B) is due at least in part to alterations in the ATP-dependent gating of the CFTR channel. AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, stabilizes the open state of the phosphorylated wild type CFTR channel in the presence of ATP (16Hwang T.C. Nagel G. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4698-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17Baukrowitz T. Hwang T.C. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19349-19353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 2 mmATP, AMP-PNP (0.4–5 mm) induced long open states in the wild type CFTR channel expressed in HEK 293 cells (Fig.4 A), with an increase in mean open lifetime from 96.0 ± 9.3 ms to 133.2 ± 15.6 ms (Fig.4 B). In contrast, AMP-PNP (2 mm) had no effect on either the open lifetime or the P o of the ΔR-CFTR channel (Fig. 4 B). The effect of AMP-PNP on ΔR-CFTR was independent of PKA phosphorylation (data not shown). Higher concentrations of AMP-PNP (>10 mm) inhibited the opening rate of both wild type and ΔR-CFTR channels (data not shown). We next tested the effect of PPi on the wild type and ΔR-CFTR channel. PPi had a biphasic effect on the wild type CFTR channel (Fig. 5). At 0.2–5 mm, PPi increasedP o of wild type CFTR by promoting long open states of the channel (Fig. 5, left panels), but at concentrations > 10 mm, PPi reducedP o. In contrast, the stimulating effect of PPi was not seen in the ΔR-CFTR channel (Fig. 5,right panels). In more than 14 experiments, we never observed any increase in P o or burst duration of the ΔR-CFTR channel following the addition of PPi(0.2–10 mm). Rather, PPi, even at low concentrations, consistently inhibited the opening rate of the ΔR-CFTR channel (Fig. 5 B). At very high concentrations of PPi, both the CFTR and the ΔR-CFTR channels opened predominantly to the 3-pS conductance state, which complicated calculation of P o. It has been observed in several laboratories that the ability of CFTR to be locked open by PPi and ATP analogs depends on the opening rate of the channel (16Hwang T.C. Nagel G. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4698-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 25Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. Josephson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7361-7368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed that the effect of PPi and AMP-PNP on the wild type CFTR correlated withP o of the channel; the lock-open effect is faster with a higher P o channel (data not shown). If the long open states were just a statistical probability that occurred with enough openings, then observing the ΔR-CFTR channel, with P o about one-third that of the wild type channel, for a longer time period should eventually allow us to observe prolonged open states. We continued recording of the ΔR-CFTR channel in typical experiments either with or without PKA for 10 min without ever observing prolonged channel openings. After the addition of AMP-PNP (2 mm, n = 6) or PPi (0.2–5 mm, n = 17), we recorded the channel for over 20 min and never observed the prolonged open state. The open time histogram demonstrating this for PPi is displayed in Fig. 10. We conclude that the failure of the ΔR-CFTR channel to enter the bursting state, with or without these drugs, is not merely the consequence of lowP o and fewer openings of the channel but represents a distinct functional difference between wild type CFTR and ΔR-CFTR. Vanadate, an analog of Pi, inhibits a variety of transport ATPases (26Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). It binds tightly at a site from which Pi is released following its cleavage from ATP and thus precludes further cycles of ATP hydrolysis. Vanadate enhances the activity of the native CFTR channel in the heart membrane (17Baukrowitz T. Hwang T.C. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 473-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and the wild type CFTR channel heterologously expressed in different cell lines (19Carson M.R. Winter M.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19349-19353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of VO4 on the wild type and ΔR-CFTR channels is shown in Fig. 6. Single channel records indicate that the stimulatory effect of VO4on the wild type CFTR channel is largely due to the increase in open lifetime. At VO4 concentrations > 1 mm, the wild type CFTR channel remained open essentially all of the time (n = 14, Fig. 6, left). In contrast, VO4 reduced P o of the ΔR-CFTR channel (n = 6; Fig. 6, right). We have shown previously that the wild type CFTR channel contained two distinct subconductance states of ∼5–6 pS (M) and ∼3 pS (L) in addition to the full conductance state (8 pS, H) (21Xie J.

The signaling pathways that characterize each cell type play a crucial role in determining the responsiveness to cytokine triggering. Activin A has been shown to suppress the growth of primary hepatocytes. Similarly, the human HepG2 hepatoma cell line was growth arrested by activin A as judged by lack of cell proliferation and suppression of DNA synthesis. In HepG2 cells activin A further induced accumulation of retinoblastoma protein in the hypophosphorylated form known to prevent entrance into S phase. This finding implies the involvement of cyclin dependent kinases and CDK inhibitors. Examination of HepG2 cells following addition of activin A revealed reduced expression of CDK4 and conversely, an increase in the CKI p21WAF1/Cip1. This accumulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 protein was partly due to increased transcriptional activity. Functional inactivation of p53, using a miniprotein that oligomerizes with p53 and abrogates DNA binding, abolished the ability of activin A to induce transcriptional activation from the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter. Thus, activin A, like transforming growth factor β, seems to suppress cell growth through the downstream target Rb. However, each of these cytokines seem to operate through a distinct pathway."

(1Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Vacuolar H+-ATPases are multisubunit complexes with an overall structure and subunit composition very similar to the F1F0-ATPases of bacteria, chloroplasts, and the inner mitochondrial membrane (2Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The V1 sector of the V-ATPase, which contains the ATP-binding sites, is a cytoplasmically-oriented complex of peripheral subunits, while the V0 sector consists of integral membrane subunits and contains the proton pore (3Kane P.M. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The electrochemical gradient generated by the V-ATPases is crucial for processes such as protein sorting, zymogen activation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the transport of ions, amino acids, and other metabolites (4Anraku Y. Umemoto N. Hirata R. Ohya Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). V-ATPases are highly conserved between fungi, plants, and animals. Thirteen different polypeptides, ranging in molecular mass from 10 to 100 kDa have been identified as subunits of the V-ATPase of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. The genes encoding all of these subunits have been cloned (Ref. 6Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol.

The products of four other genes (VMA12,VMA21–23) are also required for assembly of the yeast V-ATPase even though they are not part of the final complex (9Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ho M.N. Ohya Y.

V-ATPases are present in several distinct locations within a single cell. Very little is known about how enzyme activity is regulatedin vivo to maintain different organelles within a single cell at different specific pH values or to adjust organelle acidification in response to changing extracellular conditions. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the regulation of vacuolar acidification by V-ATPases (see Ref. 12Forgac M. Organellar Ion Channels and Transporters. The Rockefeller University Press, New York1996: 121-132Google Scholar for a recent review). Reversible dissociation of the peripheral V1 and integral V0 domains in response to changes in growth conditions (13Graf R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20908-20913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,14Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has indicated that disassembly and reassembly may be a means of regulating V-ATPase activity in vivo. Regulation of acid secretion by changes in the density of V-ATPase in the apical membrane has been demonstrated in intercalated cells in the kidney (15Gluck S. Cannon C. Al-Awquati Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4327-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Reversible disulfide bond interchange (16Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Taiz S.L. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23325-23333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nelson N. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and changes in membrane potential (21Arai H. Pink S. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Fuch S. Schmid S. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) have also been suggested as possible means of regulating V-ATPase activity. Biochemical studies on the enzyme isolated from bovine clathrin-coated vesicles have indicated that reversible sulfhydryl-disulfide bond interconversion within the catalytic subunit may play a role in controlling V-ATPase activity in vivo (16Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, these studies show that disulfide bond formation between conserved cysteine residues near the nucleotide-binding site of the catalytic subunit results in inactivation of the V-ATPase and that this inactivation can be reversed by a disulfide interchange within the catalytic subunit. Furthermore, Dschida and Bowman (23Dschida W.J.A. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1557-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that reducing agents have a stabilizing effect on the V-ATPase fromNeurospora crassa and oxidizing agents are potent inhibitors of the V-ATPase in vitro. These results suggest that the redox state of the immediate environment may be an important regulator of vacuolar ATPase activity, but this has not been demonstrated in vivo. In a genetic screen designed to identify novel genes affecting V-ATPase activity, we isolated a mutation in the CYS4 gene. We report here that the product of the CYS4 gene is required for thein vivo activity, but not the biosynthesis and assembly of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase, when cells are grown in rich medium. Mutations in CYS4 lead to a decrease in the cellular concentration of reduced glutathione as a result of impaired cysteine biosynthesis. Our results provide the first in vivo evidence in support of previous results (17Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dschida W.J.A. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1557-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) which suggest that the V-ATPase may be inactivated in a less reducing environment and that this inactivation involves a highly conserved catalytic site cysteine.

Open table in a new tab Yeast strain YOY14-4Bawas transformed with a yeast genomic library as described (27Randolph E. Biotechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast genomic library, constructed by cloning a yeast partialSau3A genomic DNA into the BamHI site of the CEN plasmid, YCp50, was a kind gift from Dr. Saul Honigberg at Syracuse University. Transformants carrying a URA3-containing plasmid capable of complementing the Vma− growth phenotype of YOY14 were selected directly on SD-ura (supplemented minimal medium lacking uracil) plates buffered to pH 7.5. Plasmids were isolated from transformants as described (28Strathern J.N. Higgins D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and retransformed into YOY14-4Ba to confirm the phenotype. Various fragments (Fig.1) of the complementing DNA were subcloned into pRS316 (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and tested for complementation. All DNA manipulations were done as described by Sambrook et al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A null cys4 strain was constructed by the one-step allele replacement method (31Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). The 870-base pair AgeI fragment within the CYS4 open reading frame in plasmid pYO49 was replaced by a 2.1-kb HpaI fragment containing the LEU2 gene. The resulting plasmid (pYO50) was digested with ApaI and SacII to release the LEU2-disrupted allele from the vector and the linear DNA fragment generated was used to transform yeast strain SF838-5Aa. Leu+ transformants were selected and disruption of the CYS4 locus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction from chromosomal DNA using synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GGTAGAATTCATCCTTCCAG-3′ and 5′-GATAACATCAGTGACCTTAGC-3′. Isolation of yeast genomic DNA for polymerase chain reaction analysis was carried out as described by Nasmyth and Reed (32Nasmyth K.A. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) except that DNA was treated with RNase A for 25 min at 37 °C and 5 min at 65 °C before the final precipitation. Haploid yeast strain YOY14-4Ba carrying theCYS4 gene on a URA3-containing plasmid (pYO38) was mated with haploid strain SF838-5Aαcys4Δ::LEU2. Diploids were selected on supplemented minimal medium lacking both uracil and leucine and named YOY12/pYO38. YOY12/pYO38 cells growing in YEPD, pH 5.0, plates were patched on sporulation medium and incubated at 30 °C for 5–6 days. Tetrads were dissected on YEPD, pH 5.0, plates and incubated at 30 °C for 30–48 h to allow the spores to germinate. The CYS4locus was disrupted in a vma1Δ::URA3 strain (SF838-5Aa vma1Δ::URA3) as described above. The resulting vma1Δ cys4Δ strain was crossed to yeast strain PNY1 (33Liu Q. Leng X.-H. Newman P.R. Vasilyeva E. Kane P.M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11750-11756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to obtain a heterozygous diploid yeast strain (YOY13) with only one functional copy of the CYS4 gene and no wild-type allele of the VMA1 gene (the only functional copy is the C261V mutant allele, designated here as vma1–51, integrated at the URA3 locus). YOY13 was sporulated and tetrads were dissected on YEPD, pH 5.0, plates. cys4 spores, identified by their cysteine auxotrophy, were selected. Whole cell lysates were prepared from selected (cys4) spores and analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody 7D5 directed against the 69-kDaVMA1 gene product. This antibody is able to detect the product of the vma1–51 mutant allele of VMA1(33Liu Q. Leng X.-H. Newman P.R. Vasilyeva E. Kane P.M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11750-11756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Spores in which the vma1–51 mutation had co-segregated with the cys4-Δ1 mutation were selected. One such spore, YOY13-2Ca, was used in the experiments described here. Vacuolar accumulation of quinacrine was assessed as described by Roberts et al. (34Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 194: 644-661Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Once stained, cells were visualized within 10 min using a Zeiss Axioskop Routine immunofluorescence microscope. Cells were viewed under Nomarski optics to observe normal cell morphology and under a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter with a 100 × objective to observe vacuolar staining. Solubilization of vesicles and purification of the vacuolar H+-ATPase were performed basically as described (3Kane P.M. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 51Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 0.5–1 mg of solubilized vesicles were layered on a 12 ml of 20–50% (w/v) glycerol gradient and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 8 h in a Beckman Ti-75 rotor. Sixteen 700-μl fractions were collected and analyzed for ATPase activity to identify fractions containing peak ATPase activity. Fractions were diluted 1:1 with water and protein precipitated by addition of an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were solubilized in 50 μl of cracking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol), separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and detected by silver staining or Western blotting. To determine the specific activity of the purified V-ATPase, protein was precipitated as described above and resuspended in cracking buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentration was then determined using Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit. Whole cell lysates and solubilized vacuolar membrane vesicles were prepared, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (35Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were probed with monoclonal antibodies 10D7, 7D5, 13D11, and 7A2, and polyclonal anti-27-kDa subunit antisera against the 100-, 69-, 60-, 42, and 27-kDa subunits, respectively, of the yeast V-ATPase (35Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Plasmid DNA for sequencing was purified using the QIAprep-spin Plasmid Kit from QIAGEN. Sequencing was done by the dideoxy chain termination method using SequenaseRsequencing kit with Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and 35S-dATP. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and preparation of vacuolar membrane vesicles were performed as described by Roberts et al. (34Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 194: 644-661Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Vacuolar ATPase activity was measured in a coupled enzyme assay as described previously (37Lotscher H.-R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The effects of various oxidizing and reducing agents on V-ATPase activity were tested by preincubating 5-μg vesicles with the indicated agent in 100 μl of buffer (15 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.0, 4.8% glycerol). At the end of the incubation period, the whole reaction mixture was assayed for ATPase activity as described (37Lotscher H.-R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Equivalent concentrations of the oxidizing and reducing agents were shown not to inhibit the enzymes of the coupled ATPase assay system. Purification of the V-ATPase was carried out as described. 2Y. E. Oluwatosin and P. M. Kane, submitted for publication. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and silver staining was performed as described (39Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). The MEY14 strain, carrying the vma41-1 mutation was obtained in a genetic screen designed to identify genes required for vacuolar membrane ATPase activity in yeast.2 The screen was based on the set of growth phenotypes characteristic of mutants with loss of vacuolar membrane V-ATPase activity (vma mutants). The Vma− growth phenotypes include inability to grow in medium buffered to pH 7 or above, medium containing 100 mmCaCl2, or medium containing a non-fermentable carbon source. After backcrossing to the original MEY14 strain to remove background mutations, one Vma− spore, YOY14-4Ba, was selected for further analysis. In addition to Vma− phenotypes, both the MEY14 mutant and the YOY14-4Ba strain are unable to grow on minimal medium, suggesting the cosegregation of the Vma− phenotype and an undetermined nutritional auxotrophy. The VMA41 gene was cloned by complementation of the pH-dependent growth phenotype of the YOY14-4Ba strain. The YOY14-4Bamutant strain was transformed with a yeast DNA library on a single copy (CEN) plasmid (YCp50). Transformants were selected on SD-ura, pH 7.5, medium and 15 independent Ura+Vma+transformants were obtained. Plasmids were recovered from transformants and re-checked for complementation. All 15 plasmids were able to restore growth at pH 7.5 to the YOY14-4Ba strain. Restriction endonuclease analyses revealed that all 15 contain the same 11-kb yeast DNA insert (Fig. 1). Various subclones of plasmid pMEY14-1 were generated in the yeast shuttle vector pRS316. Analyses of these sublones indicated that a 2-kbXbaI-SphI fragment is sufficient for complementation (Fig. 1). A 350-base pair region internal to this fragment was sequenced and used to search for homology to any sequences in the GenEMBL data base. This analysis revealed that the sequenced region (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 1) lies within the reported nucleotide sequence of the yeast NHS5 gene for β-thionase, also known as the STR4 or CYS4 gene for cystathionine-β-synthase (40Cherest H. Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5366-5374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kruger W.D. Cox D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6614-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For clarity, theCYS4 nomenclature is used throughout this report. TheCYS4 gene product is essential for cysteine metabolism; as a result, cys4 mutants exhibit a cysteine-dependent growth phenotype (40Cherest H. Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5366-5374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A LEU2-disrupted copy (plasmid pYO50) of the CYS4 open reading frame was constructed as shown in Fig. 1. Haploid yeast strain SF838-5Aα was transformed with ApaI/SacII-digested pYO50 and stable Leu+ transformants selected. DNA was extracted from three independent transformants and the parental wild type strain and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction to confirm the disruption of theCYS4 locus in the transformants. The results (not shown) indicate that the 968-base pair fragment, expected from the wild typeCYS4 locus, was replaced by a larger, 2.3-kb fragment in the transformants, indicating that the CYS4 gene has been disrupted in these cells. The growth phenotypes of cys4Δcells are indistinguishable from those of the original YOY14-4Ba mutant. In addition to the characteristic Vma− growth phenotypes, cys4Δ cells are unable to grow on minimal medium without externally supplied cysteine. These results suggest that a single mutation is responsible for both the Vma− phenotypes and the cysteine auxotrophy of the mutant cells. To determine if the Vma− growth phenotype of thevma41 strain is directly related to its cysteine auxotrophy, YOY14-4Ba and cys4Δ cells were supplied with cysteine or reduced glutathione. Under these conditions, the mutant cells were able to grow on minimal medium. Interestingly, externally supplied cysteine was able to partially complement the growth phenotype of YOY14 strain on YEPD medium buffered to pH 7.5 (Fig.2), with glutathione giving better complementation than cysteine. Conversely, depletion of intracellular glutathione in wild type cells by addition of 50 μm1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (57Li Z.-S. Szczypka M. Lu Y.-P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6509-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) prevented growth of the cells on YEPD medium buffered to pH 7.5 (data not shown) under conditions where growth of cells on YEPD buffered to pH 5.0 continued. These results indicate that glutathione deficiency results in a pH-dependent (Vma−) growth phenotype in yeast. To confirm that vma41–1 is indeed an allele ofCYS4, diploid strain YOY12/pYO38, obtained from a cross between cys4-Δ1 and YOY14-4Ba/pYO38 was sporulated and the resulting tetrads dissected. We found that YOY12 cured of the plasmid pYO38 was unable to sporulate, even after 2 weeks in sporulation medium. This is consistent with previous results indicating that glutathione auxotrophic mutants ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe are defective in sporulation (42Chaudhuri B. Ingavale S. Bachhawat A.K. Genetics. 1997; 145: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrad analysis indicated a 4:0 segregation of the Vma−phenotype in YOY12 spores since all Ura− spores were Vma− and all Ura+ spores were also Vma+. Moreover, when Ura+ spores lost the plasmid pYO38, they became Vma−. Also, YOY12 diploids lacking plasmid pYO38 exhibit a pH-dependent growth phenotype. These results confirm that vma41-1 is allelic toCYS4. All knownvma mutants are unable to accumulate the fluorescent weak base, quinacrine, in their vacuoles as a result of loss of vacuolar acidification (25Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Quinacrine vital staining was used to assess vacuolar acidification in YOY14-4Ba (vma41-1) andcys4Δ mutant cells. Our results (Fig.3) show that mutants lacking a functionalCYS4 gene are unable to accumulate quinacrine in their vacuoles, indicating loss of vacuolar acidification in these mutants. Since GSH was able to complement the pH-dependent growth phenotype of cys4 mutants, it may also be able to restore quinacrine accumulation in the vacuole. Fig. 3 shows partial restoration of vacuolar acidification by GSH as indicated by partial vacuolar staining with quinacrine in the presence of GSH. To begin to understand the basis of the Vma− growth and vacuolar acidification defects of cys4 mutants, we examined the steady-state levels of several V-ATPase subunits and one specific assembly factor in these cells. Whole cell protein extracts prepared from YOY14-4Ba and cys4Δ cells were analyzed by Western blotting. The results show that the 69-, 60-, 54-, 42-, and 27-kDa peripheral subunits of the V-ATPase and the 25-kDa (Vma12p) V-ATPase assembly factor are present in cys4 mutant cells at normal levels compared with wild type cells (Fig.4 A). Addition of GSH to the growth medium does not increase the steady state levels of the V-ATPase subunits in cys4-Δ1 cells (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that, even in the absence of additional extracellular glutathione, there is sufficient cysteine in the mutants during growth in rich medium to support normal levels of subunit biosynthesis. Previous results (43Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the presence of V-ATPase subunits at normal levels does not always imply assembly of the enzyme. Therefore,"
https://openalex.org/W2322178843,"The exact mechanisms for the selective toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs against tumor cells are not fully understood. We designed a series of experiments to test the possibility that the positive proliferative signal initiated by oncogenes might change the sensitivity for apoptosis induction by the anticancer drug etoposide (VP16), an inhibitor of topoisomerase II (Topo II). Treatment with VP16 induced significantly increased apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells transformed by oncogenic src, ras or raf, compared with the normal 3T3 cells. Apopototic changes involved nuclear DNA fragmentation, morphological alterations and decreased viability. Furthermore it was shown that stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) was activated much more strongly in all three transformed lines compared to untransformed cells by VP16 treatment, while slight activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1) was observed in all four cell lines. In addition, the transformed cells displayed arrest in mid-S-phase following the treatment, whereas NIH3T3 cells were primarily arrested in late S and G2/M phase. Finally, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 WAF1 was induced in all four cell lines, although induction of p53 was not detected in any of these cell lines. Taken together our results demonstrated that oncogenic transformation can sensitize the cells to apoptosis induction, stress kinase activation and cell cycle arrest in response to VP16 treatment. These results may have important implications for understanding the selective toxicity of anti-cancer drugs in tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W1985028821,"Although genetic alterations of chromosome band 9p21-22 occur frequently in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines, alterations of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a located in this region are less common in corresponding primary tumors. To further investigate genetic alterations at 9p21-22 and p16INK4a in primary HNSCC, a paired set of 21 tumors and blood specimens that were shown previously to exhibit allelic loss at 3p and elsewhere, were tested for LOH at 9p21-22 using eight different highly polymorphic marker. Sixteen of the samples (81%) exhibited LOH for at least one marker. Frequent LOH was found surrounding p16INK4a and at three additional non-contiguous regions of 9p21-22. No homozygous deletions were identified. SSCP screening and direct sequence analysis led to the identification of mutations the p16INK4a gene in two tumors. p16INK4a was not hypermethylated in any of the samples studied. Furthermore, there was no correlation between LOH at 9p21-22 and the RB1 tumor suppressor gene. These findings indicate that in the set of tumors that we tested, LOH at 9p21-22 is common in primary HNSCC but that genetic alterations of p16INK4a located in this region are unusual. Additional tumor suppressor genes at 9p21-22 may therefore be involved in the pathogenesis of this tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2333879119,"R-Ras belongs to a family of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins and exhibits 55% amino acid identity to H-Ras. It has been demonstrated that H-Ras inhibits cell death caused by interleukin-3 (IL-3) withdrawal in BaF3 cells (Kinoshita et al. (1995b); Terada et al. (1995)). In the present study, we examined whether R-Ras also rescues BaF3 cells from the factor-deprived cell death. To do this, several BaF3 transfectants were established, in which expression of wild-type as well as mutant R-Ras was regulated by an inducible promoter. Using these transfectants, we found that expression of an activated R-Ras mutant, R-Ras (Q87L), suppressed the death of IL-3-deprived BaF3 cells. On the other hand, expression of the wild-type and the dominant-negative mutant of R-Ras showed no inhibitory effect on cell death, indicating that R-RasGTP abrogated cell death caused by deprivation of IL-3. Furthermore, it was found that IGF-I in serum was required for the anti-apoptotic activity of R-Ras. Suppression of cell death by R-Ras(Q87L) was inhibited by wortmannin, LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors), or PD98059 (inhibitor for MEK, a specific activator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)). In addition, we have shown that, in HEK293 cells, R-Ras and IGF-I could activate MAPK synergistically. Also, PI3K activity was co-immunoprecipitated with an activated mutant of R-Ras. These results suggest that R-Ras in collaboration with IGF-I suppressed apoptotic cell death of BaF3 caused by IL-3 deprivation, presumably by modulating the activitites of MAPK and PI3K."

https://openalex.org/W2027824009,"Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein whose activity has been detected in germline cells and in neoplastic and immortal cells. Telomerase compensates the telomere loss arising by the end replication problem by synthesizing telomeric repeats at the 3′ end of the eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomerase is reactivated during cancer progression in human and mice. In order to determine whether the telomerase activity can be upregulated in vitro in response to DNA damaging agents, we examined the telomerase activity in five Chinese hamster cell lines following exposure to 5 J/m2 or 40 J/m2 UV-C radiation. All the cell lines tested showed an increase in telomerase activity in the PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) in a dose dependent manner. This increase in telomerase activity correlated well with the number of cells being in the S and G2/M phase after UV exposure. However, in unirradiated control cells, similar levels of telomerase activity were observed in different phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, telomeric signals were clustered in one or more parts of the disintegrating nuclear particles of the apoptotic cell as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This is the first study to demonstrate the induction of telomerase activity following exposure to DNA-damaging agents like UV radiation in Chinese hamster cells in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1978976864,"Meprins are mammalian zinc metalloendopeptidases with protease domains structurally related to astacin, the prototype of the “astacin family” of metalloproteases. Mature, active astacins are produced by proteolytic removal of an activation peptide to generate a new NH2-terminal residue. Structural studies indicate that the NH2-terminal ammonium group inserts into a water-filled cavity adjacent to the active site to form a salt bridge with a Glu residue that is conserved in all astacins. A similar interaction is known to play a crucial role in the activation of trypsin, resulting in the hypothesis that this salt bridge is required for the activation of astacin-like proteases. In this study, we have used the mouse meprin α subunit as a model to test this hypothesis of zymogen activation of the astacins. Mutants were generated to vary the NH2-terminal residue of the mature meprin α subunit (Asn78) and its putative salt bridge partner (Glu178). In addition, mutants creating NH2-terminal extensions and truncations were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The recombinant proteins were activated by limited protease digestion and assayed for enzymatic activity and thermal stability. Point mutations of Asn78resulted in enzymes with activity comparable to the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the structure of this side chain is not essential for activity. NH2-terminal extension mutants of meprin α retained partial activity, with greater decreases against peptide relative to protein substrates. A mutant with a deletion of Asn78 to disrupt salt bridge formation with Glu178 had full activity, indicating that the putative salt bridge with Glu178 is not essential for enzyme activity. However, all changes in meprin α subunit NH2-terminal structure were found to decrease the thermal stability of the enzyme. These observations and additional data indicate that the zymogen activation mechanism of meprin and other astacins differs from that of the trypsin family of enzymes, and has some features in common with matrixins.

The “astacin family” of metalloendopeptidases comprises a group of proteins involved in a wide range of biological functions in organisms as diverse as the sea urchin, Drosophila, and mammals (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Examples include Tolloid, a protein involved in dorsal/ventral patterning inDrosophila (13Childs S.R. O'Connor M.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 169: 209-220Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and bone morphogenetic protein-1 (procollagen C-proteinase), an enzyme required for the post-translational processing of procollagen types I–III (14Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Other astacin-like enzymes (“astacins”) have been identified by the cloning of their cDNAs, but have yet to be characterized at the protein level (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Astacins are initially synthesized as inactive precursors with an NH2-terminal prosequence (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J.

Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal sequence analyses of mature astacin, meprin A, and the procollagen C-proteinase indicate that the active forms of these enzymes have undergone a processing event that removes the prosequence (11Jiang W.

Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal residue of mature astacins is a small, uncharged amino acid, usually Ala or Asn (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of crayfish astacin reveals that the NH2-terminal residue of the mature enzyme resides in a water-filled cavity adjacent to the zinc binding site, where its ammonium group forms a water-mediated salt bridge with a Glu side chain that is conserved in all astacins (15Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A molecular modeling study predicted that this arrangement is also possible for the meprin α subunit catalytic domain (16Stöcker W. Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Bode W. Zwilling R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but the charged groups are bridged by two water molecules (Fig. 1). A similar interaction has been observed to be required for the activation of trypsin (17Huber R. Bode W. Acct. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar), leading to the prediction that formation of this salt bridge is essential for the activation of astacins (15Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16Stöcker W. Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Bode W. Zwilling R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we have expressed and characterized a series of mutants of the mouse meprin α subunit. Point mutations have been introduced to change the side chain of Asn78, the NH2-terminal residue of mature meprin, and Glu178, the two residues implicated in salt bridge formation. Mutagenesis has also been used to extend and truncate the mature α subunit NH2 terminus to disrupt the interaction of the terminal ammonium group with the conserved Glu178. Recombinant proteins were expressed and tested for activity and thermal stability. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 1573) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) 1The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BK+, bradykinin analog 2-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-OH, where Dnp is 2,4-dinitrophenyl; glut-AAF-MNA, glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (“complete DMEM”). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Unless otherwise noted, all media and cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. For the expression of meprin α subunits, wild-type and mutant cDNAs were cloned into the expression plasmid pCB3 (a generous gift of Dr. Colleen Brewer, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). pCB3 is a derivative of pCMV-1 (18Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with transcription driven by the promoter of a human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene. Plasmids used for transfection experiments were purified using reagents and columns purchased from Qiagen, Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). Expression plasmids were transfected into 293 cells by a calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (19Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) and were cotransfected with the plasmid pVA1 (20Akusjärvi G. Svensson C. Nygard O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to enhance mRNA translation in the adenovirus-transformed 293 cells. After transfection, cells were grown for 24 h in complete DMEM, then switched to serum-free OptiMEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.), and grown for an additional 36–48 h before the medium was collected for analysis of secreted meprin α subunits. The structural coordinates of astacin and a molecular model of the meprin α subunit protease domain were obtained from the Brookaven Protein Data Bank. The files for astacin (1AST 5) and meprin (1IAF 8) were imaged and manipulated using InsightII™ software (Biosym/MSI, San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics (Mountain View, CA) workstation. For each recombinant protein preparation, serum-free conditioned medium from four 100-mm plates was concentrated 40-fold using Centriprep 30 cartridges (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA); diluted 10-fold in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0; and reconcentrated. Protein concentrations were measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) and found to be 0.8–1.0 mg/ml in the 40-fold concentrated media samples. Meprin α subunit zymogens were activated by a limited digestion with eitherl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) or endoproteinase Arg-C (Boehringer Mannheim). For trypsin activation, proteins were diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0; trypsin was added to 10 μg/ml, and the mixture was incubated at 24 °C for 30 min. Trypsin was then inhibited by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) to 40 μg/ml. Conditions for activation by endoproteinase Arg-C were as described previously (21Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), except that 0.1 mg/ml endoproteinase Arg-C was included in the reaction, and incubation was at 37 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, endoproteinase Arg-C was inhibited by the addition of 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (Sigma) to 200 μm. Meprin protease activity was measured using the substrate azocasein (Sigma) as described previously (22Wolz R.L. Bond J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 325-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Peptidase activity was measured using the fluorogenic bradykinin analog BK+ (21Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in the buffer 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0, at 24 °C in a total volume of 300 μl, using 10 μm BK+. Product fluorescence was measured with a Hitachi F2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm and an emission wavelength of 417 nm. Arylamidase activity of meprin was determined using the substrate glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide (glut-AAF-MNA, purchased from Sigma). Assays were as for BK+, except that reactions contained 50 μm glut-AAF-MNA, and the respective excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 nm and 425 nm. Estimates ofk cat/K m for BK+ and glut-AAF-MNA were calculated using the equation:k cat/K m =V o /[E][S], where V o is the initial rate observed under the assay conditions described above, in which [S]≪K m (23Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 98-120Google Scholar). [E] was calculated using a meprin α subunit molecular mass of 8.8 × 104g/mol. The specific activities reported are averages of triplicate assays of at least two independent protein preparations per recombinant protein. Apparent K i values for the inhibition of meprin hydrolysis of BK+ by actinonin were determined as follows. The concentration of actinonin was varied from 0.05 μm to 0.5 μm in the presence of constant BK+ (10 μm) and constant amounts of meprin. Data were plotted as the inverse of initial rate versus actinonin concentration and fit to straight lines using a computer program. The x axis intercepts of the resulting lines were taken to be −K i . Samples of conditioned media from 293 cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels after reduction of samples with 2-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Fisher). PVDF membranes were successively incubated with an antibody raised against rat meprin A, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The membranes were then exposed to x-ray film (NEN Life Science Products). Quantitation of recombinant meprin α subunits was aided by densitometry of films from immunoblots with known amounts of meprin A (purified from mouse kidney) electrophoresed alongside the recombinant samples. Gel scanning and densitometry software was from PDI, Inc. (Huntington Station, NY). Concentrated conditioned media samples containing the proteins N78del, N78,79del, N78NN, N78NAN, or N78NAAN were activated by trypsin as described above. Each protein was then purified by chromatography on a MonoQ column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) followed by preparative SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membranes. The membranes were stained with Amido Black, and the meprin bands were excised and delivered to the Macromolecular Core Facility of this institution for six cycles of automated Edman degradation. All mutagenesis of the mouse meprin α subunit cDNA (11Jiang W. Gorbea C.M. Flannery A.V. Beynon R.J. Grant G.A. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9185-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was done using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with mutagenic oligonucleotide primers and Taq DNA polymerase (Fisher). Every PCR reaction made use of the antisense primer GGAGACTCCTGGCCTTGCAGAAGG (complementary to residues 1905–1928 of the mouse meprin α cDNA) and the appropriate mutagenic primer. Before PCR products were subcloned into the meprin α subunit cDNA, they were screened for unintended errors and verified as correct by DNA sequence analysis using dideoxy sequencing reagents purchased from Amersham Life Science. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Fisher. Prior to construction of mutations at Asn78, a mutation generating an AatII restriction site (GACGTC) upstream of this region was made to facilitate the cloning of other DNA fragments. This mutation converted Ile71 of the prosequence to Val (ATC to GTC), and was found to have no effect on the expression level or specific activities of the meprin α subunit. The I71V mutant (having no changes in the mature form of the enzyme) is therefore considered to be equivalent to “wild-type” and was utilized for the cloning and expression of all Asn78 mutants. The mutagenic primer “N78Z”: (CGCGTCGACGTCCTCCTACCACGGACACGG(G/A)NTGCCATGCGAGATCCCTCAAGC) was used in a PCR reaction to generate point mutations at Asn78. The primer is 8-fold degenerate at codon 78 ((G/A)NT) to produce a number of mutants; Ala, Ser, Thr, and Ile mutations were subcloned and used for the expression studies. Extensions of the NH2 terminus of the mature meprin α subunit were generated by primers of the design: CGCGTCGACGTCCTCCTACCACGGACACGG(X)AATGCCATGCGAGATCCCTCAAGC, where (X) represents codons inserted between Arg77, the trypsin cleavage point, and Asn78, the NH2 terminus of wild-type meprin α subunits. For the primer “N78NN,” (X) is AAT; for primer “N78NAN,” (X) is AACGCC; for “N78NAAN,” (X) is AACGCAGCC. These primers generate NH2-terminal extensions of Asn, Asn-Ala, and Asn-Ala-Ala, respectively. All DNA fragments with mutations at codon Asn78 were subcloned into the meprin α cDNA (containing the I71V mutation) using AatII andSphI restriction sites. Truncations of the mature α subunit NH2 terminus were generated by mutagenic PCR primers deleting codons 78 (“N78del”) and codons 78+79 (“N78,79del”). Primer N78del is: CGCGTCGACGTCCTCCTACCACGGACACGGGCCATGCGAGATCCCTCAAGC. Primer N78,79del is: CGCGTCGACGTCCTCCTACCACGGACACGGATGCGAGATCCCTCAAGCAGA. Mutations at Glu178 of the meprin α subunit were generated in a PCR reaction using the mutagenic primer “E178X”: GCCATGCATGCTCTGGGATTCTTCCAT(G/C)(A/C)(G/C)CAGTCAAGGACTGACCGGGAT, which is 8-fold degenerate at codon 178. Products of the resulting PCR reaction contained the mutations E178A, E178Q, and E178D. The products were subcloned into the meprin α cDNA usingSphI and NdeI restriction sites. The wild-type meprin α subunit and the mutant N78S, N78T, and N78I cDNAs were transfected into 293 cells, and the conditioned culture medium was harvested for analysis of secreted proteins. As shown by the immunoblot analysis in Fig. 2, the wild-type and mutant proteins were secreted as 94-kDa zymogens. Medium harvested from 293 control cells (transfected with the pCB3 vector containing no cDNA insert) contained no immunoreactive proteins. Zymogen activation of meprin subunits was achieved by limited trypsin digestion to remove the prosequences by cleavage at Arg77 (3Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7682-7688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), generating the mature 88-kDa enzymes. The mutants appear to be as stable as the wild-type enzyme to the trypsin treatment, as no degradation other than prosequence removal was detected. The meprin α subunit and mutants have similar activities against protein, peptide, and arylamide substrates (Table I). These activities were assayed using the substrates azocasein, BK+, and glut-AAF-MNA, respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” It is evident that the Asn78 point mutants do not differ significantly from the wild-type enzyme in their ability to degrade azocasein. The mutants also have comparable activities against the peptide substrate BK+ and the arylamide substrate glut-AAF-MNA, although it was observed that the specific activity of the N78T mutant was only 50–65% that of the wild-type α subunit for these substrates. This difference was observed consistently in three separate preparations of the N78T mutant. However, substitution of the small, polar Asn side chain with the bulky, hydrophobic side chain of Ile had no deleterious effect on enzymatic activity. Therefore, the structure of the side chain of the meprin α subunit NH2-terminal residue has relatively little influence on the mature enzyme as judged by measurements of enzymatic activity.Table IEnzymatic activities of meprin α subunits with point mutations at the NH2-terminal residueAzocaseinBK+BK+ k cat/KMglut-AAF-MNAglut-AAF-MNAk cat/KMunits/mgμmol/min · mgm −1 s−1μmol/min · mgm −1 s−1WT α6.3 × 1033.24.8 × 1050.103.0 × 103N78S5.1 × 1032.53.7 × 1050.072.1 × 103N78T6.2 × 1032.13.1 × 1050.051.6 × 103N78I5.7 × 1033.65.4 × 1050.123.5 × 103Prior to assays, meprin zymogens were activated by limited trypsin digestion as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One unit of azocasein activity is defined as the degradation of 1.1 μg of azocasein/min.

The amount of meprin included in assays was determined by densitometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” WT, wild-type. The effects of the Asn78 point mutations were further examined by investigating the thermal stability of the mutants (Fig.3). The activated wild-type and mutant proteins were incubated for varying periods of time at 53 °C, then assayed for activity using the BK+ substrate. It was observed that the wild-type enzyme is the most thermostable, retaining 84% of its initial activity after a 30-min incubation at 53 °C. The Asn78 mutants are not as stable at this temperature, and stability appears to decrease with increasing bulk of the mutant side chain. The t 1/2 values for inactivation calculated from the data are: 116 min for wild-type α, 54 min for the N78S mutant, 36 min for the N78T mutant, and 16 min for the N78I mutant. It is apparent that mutations at Asn78 having little effect on enzyme activity decrease the stability of the mature meprin α subunit. Mouse meprin α residue Glu178 is analogous to Glu103 of astacin, residing in an internal water-filled cavity (15Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16Stöcker W. Gomis-Rüth F.-X. Bode W. Zwilling R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This residue is conserved in all members of the astacin family, and has been proposed to participate in the water-mediated salt bridge with the NH2-terminal ammonium group predicted to be required for zymogen activation. We therefore generated mutants of Glu178 in the meprin α subunit and examined the properties of the recombinant enzymes to test the effects on activity and stability. Fig. 4 shows an immunoblot analysis of proteins secreted into the conditioned medium of 293 cells transfected with the mutants E178D and E178Q. Unlike the wild-type α subunit, the Glu178 mutants were degraded by the limited trypsin digestion generally used for zymogen activation (10 μg of trypsin/ml), indicating structural changes in these mutant proteins relative to the wild-type α subunit. Virtually no mature (88 kDa) enzyme was seen for the E178D mutant; degradation products are visible in the 50–70 kDa range. Similar degradation products were observed for the E178Q mutant, although some of the 88-kDa form of the enzyme is evident. When meprin α subunits were incubated with endoproteinase Arg-C, mature enzyme forms of 88 kDa for the Glu178 mutants were observed with no evidence of extensive degradation (Fig. 4). The E178A mutant exhibited sensitivity to protease treatment similar to the E178D mutant (data not shown). After limited digestion of the wild-type and E178 mutant zymogens by endoproteinase Arg-C, two of the three Glu178 mutants (E178A and E178D) were found to have no detectable protease or peptidase activity (Table II). E178Q was only partially active, with about 10% of wild-type activity against both azocasein and BK+. The inactivity of the E178D mutant is noteworthy, because the negative charge of the side chain is conserved. However, the position of this charge is predicted to be moved about 1 Å relative to that of wild-type Glu due to the shorter side chain, indicating that the precise positioning of this negative charge is critical for enzyme structure. The partially active mutant E178Q maintains the general structure of the side chain with a polar amide group, but its low activity confirms the importance of the Glu charge.Table IIEnzymatic activities of meprin α subunits mutated at Glu178AzocaseinBK+BK+ k cat/KMunits/mgμmol/min · mgm −1 s−1WT α7.8 × 1033.45.2 × 105E178Q7.7 × 1020.284.1 × 104E178ANDNDNDE178DNDNDNDProteins secreted into the conditioned medium of 293 cells transfected with wild-type and mutant cDNAs were activated by end"

Using a conditional v-Rel estrogen receptor chimera (v-RelER) which transforms cells in an estrogen-dependent manner, we constructed subtraction cDNA libraries from v-RelER-transformed bone marrow cells. Several different sequences were identified whose expression was altered upon hormone activation of v-RelER. These include two genes related to the MIP-1 chemokine family (mip-1β and a tca3 homologue), a cell surface antigen sca-2 and the transcription factor nfkb1. The expression of each gene was assayed in a number of wild-type and mutant v-Rel-expressing fibroblast and hematopoietic cells. All v-Rel-transformed hematopoietic cells tested express high levels of nfkb1 and sca-2. In fibroblasts, wild-type v-Rel induced expression of mip-1β and nfkb1, while nontransforming mutants of v-Rel failed to do so, suggesting a role for these two genes in v-Rel mediated transformation. Finally, these genes are expressed at high levels in cells overexpressing wild-type and truncated forms of c-Rel, implying that v-Rel transforms, in part, by induction of c-Rel target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2335300916,"TCFs, which are members of the Ets family of transcription factors, are recruited to the Serum Response Element (SRE) in the c-fos promoter by SRF. These Ets proteins, which are substrates for the MAP kinases, are direct targets of the Ras/MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. In this paper, we demonstrate that one of the TCFs, SAP-1a, displays a significant level of autonomous binding to the SRE Ets box. In contrast to previous observations, deletion of the SRF binding domain did not modulate the autonomous binding of SAP-1a. Also, the autonomous binding was not modulated by the phosphorylation of SAP-1a by MAP kinases. The autonomous binding was also detected in live cells: transfected SAP-1a was able to restore the response of a CArG-less SRE in PC12 cells. The response occurred in the absence of SRF recruitment since a mutant of SAP-1a in which the B-box, a domain required for interaction with SRF, had been deleted was still able to transactivate the CArG-less SRE. The transactivation was repressed by a Ras transdominant negative mutant, indicating the involvement of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Taken together, these data demonstrate that SAP-1a is capable of binding to the c-fos SRE in the absence of SRF."

Efs has characteristic regions important in intracellular signal transduction; these are an SH3 domain, a cluster of putative ligands for SH2 domains and proline-rich sequences with SH3-binding consensus. In this paper, we report cDNA cloning of human Efs and a variant of it from a hippocampal cDNA library. The human Efs gene was mapped to chromosome 14q11.2-q12 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We identified two forms of human Efs, designated hEfs1 and hEfs2. hEfs1 represents the human counterpart of original mouse embryo Efs (mEfs1). hEfs2, the newly identified form, is identical to hEfs1, except for its lack of the SH3 domain. hEfs1 and mEfs1 are 80% identical in their amino acid sequences and 100% identical within the SH3 domain. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of adult mouse tissue RNA indicated expression of Efs2 and of Efs1 in various tissues. Evidence suggesting the presence of the Efs2 protein in human tissue was obtained by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with two different anti-Efs antibodies. Possible functions of Efs2 are discussed."

Therefore, it seems that the ADP-ribosylation of actin can break an actin barrier for the movement of secretory granules in exocytotic cells. Little is known about the de-ADP-ribosylation of modified proteins. An ADP-ribosylprotein hydrolase that hydrolyzes ADP-ribosylated arginine has been purified from turkey erythrocytes (18Moss J. Oppenheimer N.J. West Jr., R.E. Stanley S.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5408-5414Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The immunoreactivity of certain proteins was identified by the use of a rat ADP-ribosylhydrolase antibody found in the most abundance in the brain, spleen, and testis (19Moss J. Stanley S.J.

ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolases from rats, humans, and mice have been cloned, and their sequences have been found to be similar (20Takada T. Iida K. Moss J. J. Biol.

It is not known whether ADP-ribosylated histone, G proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins are hydrolyzed in animals by their own enzymes or not. If actin polymerization is regulated by ADP-ribosylation, then ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase can probably be found in rat brains. Actin filaments must be destabilized before catecholamine secretion, and so stabilization by phalloidin reduces catecholamine release (21Lelkes P.I. Friedman J.E. Rosenheck K. Oplatka A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, ADP-ribosylation may help regulate exocytosis through actin polymerization and depolymerization. The de-modification of ADP-ribosylated proteins might be needed to destroy the actin barrier. Consequently, the characterization and location of ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase in the brain are of interest. Here, we describe the purification and characterization of ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase from rat brain and report on its location. [adenylate-32P]NAD (800 Ci/mmol), [adenosine-U-14C]NAD (400 mCi/mmol), and 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent (2200 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. NAD and ATP were from the Oriental Yeast Co. Cholera toxin, ADP, AMP, and ADP-ribose were from Sigma. Diphtheria toxin was from Calbiochem. Pertussis toxin was a gift from Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. Botulinum C2 toxin was a gift from Dr. Shunji Kozaki (Laboratory of Public Health, Osaka Prefecture University). A neuron-specific enolase monoclonal antibody was purchased from InRo Biomedtek. The other reagents used were analytical grade. Adult male Wistar rats (body weight, 250–300 g) were anesthetized with ether and killed. About 60 g of isolated brain (wet weight) was washed with cold saline. The isolated brains were homogenized in 4 volumes of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) that contained 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. The purification is summarized in Table I. The homogenate was centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (∼1200 mg of protein) was applied to a CM-Sepharose column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with homogenization buffer. The column was washed with 200 ml of the same buffer. The unabsorbed fraction (∼1100 mg) was collected and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with homogenization buffer. Elution was done with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.7 m. The fractions that contained ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase activity with [32P]ADP-ribosylated actin as a substrate were collected. NaCl was added to the fractions that contained ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase activity to a final concentration of 1.5 m. The fractions (∼200 mg) were loaded onto a butyl-Toyopearl column (1.5 × 20 cm; Tosoh) equilibrated with homogenization buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 1.5 to 0 m. The fractions that contained ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase activity were collected and concentrated with a Mini-module apparatus (molecular weight cut-off, >10,000; Asahi Kasei). The concentrated fraction (∼1 mg) was loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 column (2.0 × 90 cm) equilibrated with homogenization buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl. In each step, the materials generated from the reaction mixture of radiolabeled ADP-ribosylated actin and the enzyme preparation were examined by HPLC to check for ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase activity. The purified ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase was stored at 0 °C, at which temperature the enzyme activity was stable for 5 days.Table IPurification of ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase from rat brainStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgnmol/minnmol/min/mg%-fold80,000 × g supernatant12209.720.008CM-Sepharose112024.00.0211001DEAE-Sepharose21620.30.09484.63Butyl-Toyopearl1.0215.615.365.01910Sephadex C-750.5414.326.559.63310Details of the purification are given under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are typical values from the five experiments. Open table in a new tab Details of the purification are given under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are typical values from the five experiments. The standard assay for ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase activity was as follows. The substrate was prepared by thein vitro reaction at 37 °C for 30 min of 0.2 μg/ml purified ADP-ribosyltransferase II (16Matsuyama S. Tsuyama S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), 42 μg/ml monomeric cytoplasmic actin, and 0.2 mm [32P]NAD or [14C]NAD in 50 mm imidazole HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10% propylene glycol and 2 mm mercaptoethanol. After incubation, the reaction mixture was kept on ice for 2 days to allow the enzyme activity to be completely lost. The excess [32P]NAD or [14C]NAD in the reaction mixture was then removed with a Bio-Gel P-2 column equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol. The fraction containing the radiolabeled ADP-ribosylated actin (0.74–0.92 mol of ADP-ribose/mol of actin, ∼10,000 cpm/μg of protein) was used as the substrate for ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase. In some experiments, botulinum C2 toxin or nonenzymatically ADP-ribosylated actin was prepared as described elsewhere (22Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Just I. Wollenberg P. Moss J. Aktories K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); the excess radiolabeled NAD or ADP-ribose was removed by gel filtration on a TSK 3000SW or Bio-Gel P-2 column as described above, and the fraction containing ADP-ribosylated actin was used as the substrate. For the nonenzymatic preparation of ADP-ribosylated actin, [32P]ADP-ribose was produced by the incubation of 0.1 mm [32P]NAD with NADase from Neurospora crassa (Sigma) for 20 min at 35 °C. The NADase was inactivated by boiling for 3 min. [32P]ADP-ribose was separated by HPLC as described below. The purified [32P]ADP-ribose was concentrated with an evaporator. Actin (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated with 1.0 mm[32P]ADP-ribose and 10 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm triethanolamine HCl (pH 7.5) for 30 min at 30 °C. After incubation, the reaction mixture was applied to a Bio-Gel P-2 column equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The fraction containing radiolabeled actin (1.72–2.05 mol of ADP-ribose/mol of actin, 12,500 cpm/μg) was concentrated with an Amicon 10 microconcentrator and used as the substrate. In a check of the bonding of cysteine with ADP-ribose, a portion of nonenzymatically ADP-ribosylated actin was incubated with 0.5 m NaCl or 0.5m NH2OH (pH 7.5) for 2 h or with 1 mm HgCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C as previously reported (17Fujita H. Okamoto H. Tsuyama S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 1065-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After the incubation, actin was precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. The precipitated actin was examined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Other proteins (the α-subunits of the G proteins Gs, Gi, and Go and elongation factor-2) were ADP-ribosylated with ADP-ribosyltransferase II from rat brain or with cholera, pertussis, or diphtheria toxin as previously reported (1Cassel D. Pfeuffer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 2Katada T. Ui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the excess [32P]NAD and toxin were removed with two connected TSK 3000SW columns as described above. ADP-ribosylated actin, one of the G proteins, or elongation factor-2 (0.4 mg/ml) was incubated with purified ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase (5 μg/ml) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) with or without 2 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C for 30 min. During or after incubation, the radioactivity that remained in the actin or the other proteins was measured by instant TLC by the method of Huang and Robinson (25Huang K.-P. Robinson J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To check for ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase activity, we examined the products of the reaction using HPLC as follows. The reaction mixture was denatured by the addition of an equal volume of 10% perchloric acid to a final concentration of 5%. After removal of the precipitate, the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 6.0 with KOH. The resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was assayed by HPLC. Analysis was done with a C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm; G.L. Sciences Co.). After injection of the sample, 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was supplied at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min for 5 min, after which the concentration of acetonitrile was increased linearly from 0 to 55% during the next 15 min. The column effluent was monitored at 260 nm with a UV detector and a β-ray detector (A-120, Packard Japan), and the radiolabeled ADP-ribose was detected. For separation of ADP-ribosylated and unmodified actin from the reaction mixture, the incubation mixture was assayed by HPLC. Analysis was done with a C18 column (6.0 × 150 mm, 5-μm particles, 3-μm pores; G.L. Sciences Co.) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and 10% acetonitrile. After injection of the sample, the equilibration buffer was supplied continuously for 6 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, after which the concentration of acetonitrile was increased linearly up to 70% during the next 15 min. The column effluent was monitored at 280 nm with a UV detector. The effluent was fractionated. The fractions was further analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Further confirmation of the product in question as ADP-ribose was undertaken in two additional experiments. After the reaction of ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase and ADP-ribosylated actin was stopped by the addition of 9 volumes of ethanol, the supernatant was freeze-dried. The sample was dissolved in 100 μl of water. A portion of the solution was assayed by HPLC with a C18 or Bio-Rex 70 column. The remaining solution was mixed with 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mmZnCl2. The mixture was treated with venom phosphodiesterase (100 units/ml; Sigma) or with a mixture of phosphodiesterase (100 units/ml) and bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase (100 units/ml; Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C for 1 h. The radiolabeled ADP-ribose, AMP, and adenosine generated were analyzed by HPLC with a C18 or Bio-Rex 70 column, a UV monitor at 260 nm, and a β-ray detector as described previously (26Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). When the mixture of phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase was used, the inorganic [32P]phosphate generated was extracted by a method described previously (27Titanji V.P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 481: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), as follows. A 20-μl portion of the reaction mixture was mixed with 0.8 ml of 10 mmsilicotungstic acid containing 5 mmH2SO4 and 1 mmKH2PO4. After the mixture was mixed for 5 s, 0.2 ml of 5% ammonium molybdate in 1 mH2SO4 was added. Then, 1.4 ml of a 1:1 mixture of isobutyl alcohol and benzene was added, mixed for 20 s, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. One milliliter from the organic phase was analyzed with a liquid scintillation counter. The remaining portion of the reaction mixture after 20 μl was removed was used in high-resolution TLC (Silica Gel 60 F254, Merck, high-resolution TLC, catalog no. 1.05628). In TLC, the solution containing ADP-ribose and the other chemicals was spotted on a TLC plate. After the plate was developed with a 12:1:5 mixture of acetonitrile, 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 3.5) containing 5 mm tetramethylammonium bromide, and 0.1n hydrochloric acid, the plate was dried and further developed in a second direction with a 13:5:1:1 mixture of acetonitrile, water, acetic acid, and 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 3.5) containing 5 mmtetramethylammonium bromide. The locations of ADP-ribose, 5′-AMP, and adenosine were detected with UV light, and the radioactivity of each location was counted by a β-image analyzer (Betagene). 5′-Phosphoribose and ribose was detected by spraying the plate with aniline/diphenylamine/phosphoric acid reagent. After detection, each area was measured by a densitometric analyzer (Chromato Sci. Co.). Quantitative analysis was done with an external standard. After incubation of purified ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase and the substrate protein, the reaction mixture was applied to a gel filtration column (TSK 3000SW) equilibrated with 50 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm ATP or GTP. If a G protein or elongation factor-2 was used, the column was equilibrated with the same buffer and GTP. The fraction containing the de-ADP-ribosylated protein was concentrated with a microconcentrator, and the protein was assayed for de-ADP-ribosylation before being incubated with an enzyme or a bacterial toxin and [32P]NAD again. The rate of re-ADP-ribosylation was assayed by the method described above. We prepared IgG from monoclonal antibodies against rat brain ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase by the method of Goding (28Goding J.W. Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Academic Press Ltd., London1986Google Scholar). In a test of what region of rat brain ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase was recognized by the IgG, purified rat brain ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase was iodinated by the method of Bolton and Hunter (29Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). The iodinated enzyme was labeled to a specific radioactivity of 3 × 107 cpm/μg (∼1.7 mol of iodine/mol of enzyme). Each of three IgGs from the monoclonal antibodies was used to treat protein G-Sepharose, and IgG-conjugated protein G-Sepharose was washed to remove any excess IgG. The iodinated ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase was mixed with IgG-conjugated protein G-Sepharose. The mixture was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the immunocomplexes were precipitated, washed, and separated from the protein G-Sepharose by treatment with a sample buffer by SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity in the sample buffer was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. To evaluate the effects of IgG from the monoclonal antibodies on ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase activity with ADP-ribosylated actin as the substrate, each IgG was incubated with purified ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase (1 μg/ml) for 1 h, and the mixture was then incubated with ADP-ribosylated actin (0.4 mg/ml) at 30 °C for 30 min. Using these monoclonal antibodies, we made immunohistochemical preparations as follows. Rat brains were fixed by perfusion with 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 20% sucrose. The fixed brain was removed and then immersed in the same fixative for 2 h. The brain was sectioned into 5–10-μm thick slices, and these thin sections were air-dried. The sections were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and immersed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The immersed sections were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with anti-ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase monoclonal antibody (3–7 μg of IgG/ml) for 1 h. After the sections were washed, they were further treated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and stained with diaminobenzidine. Isolated rat brains were homogenized in 10 volumes of 0.32 m sucrose containing 10 mmNa+-HEPES (pH 6.8). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was layered on top of a sucrose gradient (0.85, 1.0, and 1.2 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 82,500 × g for 2 h to separate the cytosol, microsomes, endoplasmic reticulum plus the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and synaptosomes. This subcellular fractionation of the supernatant was completed by the method of Uedaet al. (30Ueda T. Greengard P. Berzins K. Cohen R.S. Blomberg F. Grab D.J. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 308-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To confirm the distribution of the cellular components, we measured the activities of succinate dehydrogenase, NADPH-cytochrome c oxidase, and enolase by methods previously described (31Earl D.C.N. Korner A. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Sottocasa G.L. Kuylenstierna B. Ernster L. Bergstrand A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar, 33Wood T. Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A portion of the isolated synaptosomes was further treated with hypotonic 10 mmNa+-HEPES (pH 6.8) for 20 min at 0 °C to separate the synaptosomal membrane and soluble components, and the mixture was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The precipitated synaptosomal membrane fraction was further treated with an alkaline solution (0.1 m Na2CO3), and the mixture was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. Each fraction was assayed for ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase activity and used in immunoblotting. Monomeric cytoplasmic actin was prepared from rat brains by the method of Weir and Frederiksen (34Weir J.P. Frederiksen D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The α-subunits of the G proteins Gs, Gi, and Gowere purified by the methods of Sternweis and Robishaw (35Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kobayashi et al. (36Kobayashi I. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Tohyama K. Kurachi Y. Itoh H. Ui M. Katada T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Elongation factor-2 was purified by the method of Sayhan et al. (37Sayhan O. Ozdemirli M. Nurten R. Bermek E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Actin polymerization was measured with a falling-ball assay as follows (38Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 211-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A 200-μl portion of a mixture of 10 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol with an actin preparation (0.4 mg/ml) was incubated at 25 °C. After the actin was added, the portion was put into a capillary tube. One end of the capillary tube was sealed with softened paraffin, and the tube was placed in a plexiglass holder so that its angle of inclination was 25°. A stainless steel ball was placed on the meniscus of the sample. The dropping velocity of the ball from the meniscus to the end tube was measured. SDS-PAGE was done by the method of Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar). The protein on the gel was stained with silver or Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Some of the gel was electroblotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was treated with monoclonal antibodies. Immunocomplexes were detected with diaminobenzidine. The protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216204) Google Scholar) or Lowry et al. (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After chromatography on CM-Sepharose, the unabsorbed fraction did not contain ADP-ribosyltransferase activity when monomeric cytoplasmic actin was the substrate (data not shown). The unabsorbed fraction had two peaks of hydrolytic activity for ADP-ribosylated actin as seen by DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography (Fig.1 A). The product in peak 1 (fractions 22–24) was identified as radiolabeled 5′-AMP, and that in peak 2 (fractions 29–35) was identified as radiolabeled ADP-ribose (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, peak 1 was phosphodiesterase activity, and peak 2 was ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity. The peak 2 fraction gave a single peak as determined by butyl-Toyopearl column chromatography (Fig. 2 A). The product of the enzyme reaction was identified by HPLC as radiolabeled ADP-ribose (data not shown). When the peak fractions containing ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase activity were chromatographed on a Sephadex G-75 column, a single peak of absorbance at 280 nm was found (Fig. 2 B). The product of the enzyme reaction of the single peak was identified as [32P]ADP-ribose by HPLC (data not shown). The molecular weight of the purified ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase was estimated to be 62,000 from the results of gel filtration. SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme showed it to be homogeneous and to have a molecular weight of 62,000; one major band of protein was detected on the gel by silver staining (Fig. 2 C). When actin ADP-ribosylated by purified ADP-ribosyltransferase II was loaded onto an HPLC column, a large amount of ADP-ribosylated actin was eluted separately from a small amount of unmodified actin (Fig.3 A). When a mixture of ADP-ribosylated actin and purified ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase was loaded onto an HPLC column, a large amount of unmodified actin was eluted separately from a small amount of ADP-ribosylated actin (Fig.3 B). After fractionation of the mixture by HPLC, the radioactivity that corresponded to the ADP-ribosylated actin had decreased, and SDS-PAGE did not show protein degradation (Fig. 3,a and b). Comparison of the elution profile with that of a standard mixture of nucleotides showed that the retention times of the products from the reaction mixture of purified ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase and ADP-ribosylated actin were the same as the retention time of free ADP-ribose (Fig. 1). The area of the product peak increased with increasing incubation time, suggesting that the formation of the product was time-dependent. The purification of brain ADP-ribosylactin hydrolase"
