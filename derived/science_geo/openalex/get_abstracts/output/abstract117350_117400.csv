https://openalex.org/W1549194476,"Caveolae are plasma membrane specializations that have been implicated in signal transduction. Caveolin, a 21-24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal structural component of caveolae membranes in vivo. G protein α subunits are concentrated in purified preparations of caveolae membranes, and caveolin interacts directly with multiple G protein α subunits, including Gs, Go, and Gi2. Mutational or pharmacologic activation of Gα subunits prevents the interaction of caveolin with G proteins, indicating that inactive Gα subunits preferentially interact with caveolin. Here, we show that caveolin interacts with another well characterized signal transducer, Ras. Using a detergent-free procedure for purification of caveolin-rich membrane domains and a polyhistidine tagged form of caveolin, we find that Ras and other classes of lipid-modified signaling molecules co-fractionate and co-elute with caveolin. The association of Ras with caveolin was further evaluated using two distinct in vitro binding assays. Wild-type H-Ras interacted with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-caveolin fusion proteins but not with GST alone. Using a battery of GST fusion proteins encoding distinct regions of caveolin, Ras binding activity was localized to a 41amino acid membrane proximal region of the cytosolic N-terminal domain of caveolin. In addition, reconstituted caveolin-rich membranes (prepared with purified recombinant caveolin and purified lipids) interacted with a soluble form of wild-type H-Ras but failed to interact with mutationally activated soluble H-Ras (G12V). Thus, a single amino acid change (G12V) that constitutively activates Ras prevents or destabilizes this interaction. These results clearly indicate that (i) caveolin is sufficient to recruit soluble Ras onto lipid membranes and (ii) membrane-bound caveolin preferentially interacts with inactive Ras proteins. In direct support of these in vitro studies, we also show that recombinant overexpression of caveolin in intact cells is sufficient to functionally recruit a nonfarnesylated mutant of Ras (C186S) onto membranes, overcoming the normal requirement for lipid modification of Ras. Taken together, these observations suggest that caveolin may function as a scaffolding protein to localize or sequester certain caveolin-interacting proteins, such as wild-type Ras, within caveolin-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2048389635,"Reports that interleukin-8 (IL-8) induces the infiltration of neutrophils followed by T-cells into injection sites led us to postulate that by stimulation of neutrophil degranulation IL-8 may cause the release of factors with chemoattractant activity for T-lymphocytes. Extracts of human neutrophil granules were chromatographed to isolate and purify T-lymphocyte chemoattractant factors. Two major peaks of T-cell chemotactic activity were purified by C18 reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The first peak was resolved further by C4 reversed phase HPLC and yielded an active fraction shown by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis to contain defensins HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3. Purified defensins HNP-1 and HNP-2 (kindly provided by Dr. R. I. Lehrer, UCLA) were also potent chemoattractants for human T-cells, while HNP-3 was inactive. The second peak of T-cell chemoattractant activity was also further purified to homogeneity by C4 reversed phase HPLC and identified by NH2-terminal sequence analysis as CAP37/azurocidin, a protein with sequence homology to serine proteases. 0.1-100 ng of defensins and 1.0-100 ng/ml CAP37 were able to stimulate in vitro T-cell chemotaxis. Neutrophil activating factors, i.e. IL-8, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin, and formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine each induced the release of CAP37 and defensins from neutrophil granules. Subcutaneous administration of defensins or CAP37/azurocidin into BALB/c mice resulted in a moderate neutrophil and mononuclear cell infiltrate by 4 h, which was greater by 24 h at the site of injection. Additionally, subcutaneous injection of defensins into chimeric huPBL-SCID mice resulted in significant infiltration by human CD3+ cells within 4 h. These results identify the antimicrobial proteins, CAP37/azurocidin and defensins HNP-1 and HNP-2, as potent neutrophil-derived chemoattractants for T-cells. These proteins represent primordial antimicrobial peptides which may have evolved into acute inflammatory cell-derived signals that mobilize immunocompetent T-cells and other inflammatory cells.

These proteins represent primordial antimicrobial peptides which may have evolved into acute inflammatory cell-derived signals that mobilize immunocompetent T-cells and other inflammatory cells. Immunologically induced inflammatory responses are multistep processes involving the production of various chemotactic factors resulting in the orchestrated recruitment of neutrophils, mast cells, monocytes, and T-cells.

IL-8 has also been reported to be an in vitro and in vivo chemoattractant for T-cells(16.Larsen C.G. Anderson A.O. Appella E. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. Science. 1989; 243: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that subcutaneous injection of human IL-8 into human T-cell-engrafted SCID mice causes an initial infiltration of murine neutrophils by 4 h into the site of injection, which is followed by a marked infiltration of human T-cells by 72 h(17.Taub, D. D., Oppenheim, J. J., Anver, M., Kelvin, D. J., Longo, D. L., Murphy, W. J. (1996) J. Clin. Invest., in pressGoogle Scholar). This delayed infiltration of human T-cells suggested that IL-8 may recruit T-cells indirectly, perhaps by stimulating the release of T-cell chemotactic factors by activated neutrophils. This hypothesis was tested by incubating purified peripheral blood neutrophils with a number of degranulating agents, including IL-8, and resulted in the release of T-cell chemotactic activity into the supernatants within 2 h. This led us to detect, purify, and identify several T-cell chemotactic factors from extracts of neutrophil granules. Rabbit anti-human CAP37 antisera was prepared by immunization with purified CAP37/azurocidin in Freund's adjuvant (both the CAP37 and antisera were kindly provided by Dr. A. Pereira of the University of Oklahoma). Purified defensins and rabbit anti-defensin antisera were kind gifts from Dr. R. I. Lehrer, UCLA. Human peripheral blood enriched in mononuclear cells or lymphocytes was obtained from normal donors by leukapheresis (National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Bethesda, MD). The blood was centrifuged through Ficoll-Hypaque at 800 × g for 30 min. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells at the interface were washed twice with PBS and centrifuged through an isosmotic Percoll gradient as described to remove monocytes. Human T-cell enrichment columns (R& Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were then used according to the manufacturer's instructions to rapidly purify the T-cells using high affinity negative selection. This isolation procedure typically yields greater than 90% CD3+ T-cells. The cells were resuspended in chemotaxis medium (RPMI 1640 containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 25 mM HEPES). T-lymphocyte migration was assessed using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (NeuroProbe, Cabin John, MD) as reported(18.Falk W.R. Goodwin R.H. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). 25 μl of the sample to be tested (diluted in chemotaxis medium) was placed in the lower compartment, and 50 μl of cell suspension (at 5 × 106 cells ml−1) was placed in the upper compartment. The two compartments were separated by a polycarbonate filter (5-μm pore size) coated with 10 μg/ml collagen type IV overnight at 4°C. The apparatus was incubated at 37°C for 3 h in humidified air with 5% CO2. At the end of the incubation period the filter was removed, fixed, and stained with LeukoStat (Fisher). The number of cells per high power field that migrated through the filter were counted by light microscopy. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. value of the migration in triplicate samples and are representative of at least three experiments. The statistical significance of the number of cells migrating in response to stimuli versus control medium was calculated using the Student's t test. Human neutrophils were isolated from granulocyte packs obtained from the Department of Transfusion Medicine. Briefly, erythrocytes were removed by sedimentation with 1.5% dextran. Mononuclear cells were centrifuged on a Ficoll-Hypaque cushion, and the residual erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis. The neutrophils were resuspended in PBS, counted, and assessed for viability. Following a wash with PBS, the neutrophils were resuspended in disruption buffer (0.25 M sucrose and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 4 mM EGTA). Neutrophils were lysed by nitrogen cavitation, and granule fractions were separated on Percoll gradients(19.Millard P.J. Henkart M.P. Reynolds C.W. Henkart P.A. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 3197-3204PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were equilibrated at 450 p.s.i. for 20 min in a nitrogen bomb and lysed by dropwise release. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was layered over 48% Percoll and centrifuged at 29,000 rpm for 26 min. The Percoll gradient was fractionated, and the fractions were assessed for granule enzymes and T-cell chemotactic activity. Granule fractions were pooled and recentrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 3 h. The granules were recovered as a white flocculent material just above the Percoll pellet. At this point aliquots of the granule-containing fraction were made and stored at −70°C until further use. Neutrophil granules (0.5 ml) were lysed by freeze-thawing (three times) in 3 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 2 M NaCl. The suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 800 × g. 1 ml of clarified supernatant was applied to a C18-300A reversed phase HPLC cartridge column (8 × 100 mm, Delta-Pak, Millipore), equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Buffer A). Absorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-90% Buffer B (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 (Fig. 1). Absorbance at 206 nm was monitored as a measure of protein concentration. Collected fractions were lyophilized and assayed for chemotactic activity. Fractions containing chemoattractant activity were pooled, lyophilized, redissolved in Buffer A, and applied to a C4 reversed phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, Bio-Rad, RP-304). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-90% Buffer B over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Fractions with activity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (20.Crouch S.P.M. Fletcher J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4504-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used for automatic sequence analysis on an Applied Biosystems sequencer model 477A. The presence of cysteine residues was inferred from the absence of detectable amino acid. Neutrophils (2 × 106 ml−1) suspended in AIM-V medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) were incubated at 37°C in 6-well plates that had been coated with fibronectin or vascular-cell adhesion molecule-1. Exocytosis was initiated by addition of the appropriate stimulus and stopped by centrifugation and removal of the supernatant. Lactoferrin and β-glucuronidase were assayed (20.Crouch S.P.M. Fletcher J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4504-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Talalay P. Fishman W.H. Huggins C. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 166: 757-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and detected to demonstrate that IL-8 was effective in degranulating the neutrophils. Protein in the cell-free medium was concentrated using StrataClean resin (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted using a rabbit anti-defensin antisera. In order to quantitate these results the blots were scanned and analyzed using the NIH Image 1.58f program. BALB/c and CB-17 scid/scid (SCID) mice were obtained from the Animal Production Area (NCI, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center). Mice were used at 8-12 weeks of age and kept in pathogen-free conditions as described(22.Murphy W.J. Taub D.D. Anver M. Conlon K. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. Longo D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1823-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SCID mice were treated with anti-asialoganglioside-M1 and injected with 1 × 108 huPBL intraperitoneally as described(22.Murphy W.J. Taub D.D. Anver M. Conlon K. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. Longo D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1823-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Immediately thereafter 0.1 ml of PBS containing our purified preparations of 1.0 μg of defensins, CAP37/azurocidin, or control PBS were injected daily one time subcutaneously into the same injection site. Chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assays for endotoxin contamination in our purified peptides revealed 0.05 endotoxin unit/20 μg of defensins and 0.114 endotoxin unit/20 μg of CAP37/azurocidin. The injection site was examined histologically either at 4 h after the first injection or 24 h later 4 h after a second injection. Experiments were performed on three to four mice/group in duplicate. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations were performed as described previously(22.Murphy W.J. Taub D.D. Anver M. Conlon K. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. Longo D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1823-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Human neutrophil granule proteins were extracted by repeated freeze-thawing in a solution of high salt and acid pH. These granule extracts yielded a T-cell chemoattractant activity that was concentrated and partially purified by C18 reversed phase HPLC chromatography. This resulted in two major peaks of chemotactic activity (Fig. 1). The proteins with chemotactic activities were further resolved by chromatography on a C4 reversed phase HPLC column. The first peak of activity was purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 2), appearing as a single band that migrated with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 3 kDa on Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE(23.Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the preparation revealed the presence of three related sequences (Table 1) corresponding to defensin HNP-1 (50% of the material), HNP-2 (30%), and HNP-3 (20%). The fact that 1) we detected only defensin sequences by sequence analysis, 2) no impurities were detected by silver staining, and 3) amino acid analysis of our preparation corresponds well with amino acid composition of defensins (data not shown) suggests that our preparation consisted of at least 95% pure defensins.Table 1 Open table in a new tab The T-cell chemotactic activity of homogeneous preparations of neutrophil-derived HNP-1, HNP-2 and HNP-3 (kindly provided by Dr. R. I. Lehrer, UCLA) were compared with our preparation. The dose response to individual HNP-1 and HNP-2 was practically identical to that of our preparation containing a mixture of HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3 (Fig. 3). Checkerboard analysis of our HNP-1 and HNP-2 showed that their effect was chemotactic rather than chemokinetic (data not shown). HNP-3, which differs from HNP-1 only by substitution of aspartate for the amino-terminal alanine, was not able to stimulate T-cell chemotaxis. It has been proposed that HNP-3 is a precursor of HNP-2 (24.Lehrer R.I. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) and proteolytic removal of the amino-terminal aspartate residue converts the inactive HNP-3 into chemotactically active HNP-2 (24.Lehrer R.I. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). While serum proteins have been reported to inhibit the antimicrobial activity of defensins(24.Lehrer R.I. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar), both HNP-1 and HNP-2 retained in vitro chemotactic activity for human T-cells in the presence of 10% human serum (data not shown). The second major peak of T-cell chemotactic activity (Fig. 1) was also further purified using the same C4 reversed phase HPLC column. In this case T-cell chemotactic activity co-eluted with a major protein peak corresponding to a homogeneous 30-kDa band on Tris/glycine SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Amino-terminal sequence analysis identified this protein as CAP37 (cationic antimicrobial protein of molecular mass 37 kDa), also known as azurocidin (Table 1). By amino acid analysis, our preparation of CAP37/azurocidin corresponds well with the known amino acid composition of CAP37/azurocidin. In addition, upon sequence analysis of our preparation we detected no other sequence except CAP37/azurocidin. These facts indicate that our preparation must be at least 95% pure. CAP37/azurocidin is a previously identified azurophilic granule protein with sequence homology to the serine protease family and has potent oxygen-independent bactericidal activity (25.Pohl J. Pereira H.A. Martin N.M. Spitznagel J.K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26.Gabay J.E. Scott R.W. Campanelli D. Griffith J. Wilde C. Marra M.N. Seeger M. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the polypeptide eluting just before CAP37/azurocidin revealed it to be a lysozyme that does not induce T-cell chemotaxis. CAP37 was chemotactic from 1.0 to 100 ng/ml, which is comparable in molar concentration with the range of defensin activity (Fig. 3). In addition, preparations of purified as well as recombinant human CAP37/azurocidin (kindly provided to us by Dr. A. Pereira) were equally potent chemoattractants for human T-cells (data not shown). Experiments were performed to ascertain that defensins and CAP37/azurocidin would be released into the extracellular environment by appropriate stimuli. Neutrophils exposed to IL-8 could be shown to degranulate with the release of lactoferrin and β-glucuronidase(27.Brandt E. Petersen F. Flad H.-D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1356-1364PubMed Google Scholar). The release of defensins following degranulating stimuli was examined by concentration of the culture supernatants and quantitative detection of the defensins released using a Western blot assay (Fig. 5)(28.Gallagher S. Winston S.E. Fuller S.A. Hurrell G.J.R. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeck A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). We established by scanning of the Western blots that IL-8 released about 10% of the total content of defensins in the granules of 2 × 106 neutrophils, while FMLP released 17% and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin 23% of the total content of defensin in the granules. The addition of cytochalasin increased the degranulating effect of IL-8 only minimally to 13% of the total and did not effect FMLP release. Tumor necrosis factor-α has also been shown to have a synergistic effect on IL-8-stimulated degranulation(27.Brandt E. Petersen F. Flad H.-D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1356-1364PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, as determined by Western blotting, IL-8 also induced the release of CAP37/azurocidin, which is also contained in the azurophilic granules (data not shown). BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 μg of the defensin or CAP37/azurocidin preparations. After 4 or 24 h the injection site was excised, and the extent and types of cells infiltrating the site were examined histologically. Within 4 h of injection the defensin and CAP37/azurocidin each resulted in infiltration by PMNs and mononuclear cells in the dermis and subcutaneous tissues (Table 2). This is in contrast to a single 1-μg injection of recombinant human IL-8, which produced a marked infiltration of PMNs by 4 h with little mononuclear cell infiltration(17.Taub, D. D., Oppenheim, J. J., Anver, M., Kelvin, D. J., Longo, D. L., Murphy, W. J. (1996) J. Clin. Invest., in pressGoogle Scholar). By 24 h, 4 h after a second injection at the same site, an even greater infiltration of PMNs and mononuclear cells was elicited by defensins as well as CAP37/azurocidin. Doses of 10 and 100 ng of defensins and CAP37 also induced neutrophil and mononuclear cell infiltrates at 24 h. Thus, human defensins and CAP37/azurocidin are capable of inducing considerable local murine neutrophil and mononuclear cell infiltration. Immunohistochemical studies of sites of defensin injection in chimeric huPBL-SCID mice were performed to establish whether there were T-cells in the infiltrate(22.Murphy W.J. Taub D.D. Anver M. Conlon K. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. Longo D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1823-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A single injection of 1 μg of defensins (HNP-1 and HNP-2) within 4 h resulted in the infiltration by low to modest numbers of human CD3+ T-lymphocytes in four of six mice examined (Table 3). In contrast, the sites of PBS injection in six control mice did not contain any human CD3+ T-cells. These in vivo results support the in vitro evidence that defensins are T-cell chemoattractants.Table 2 Open table in a new tab Table 3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The results presented in this report demonstrate that neutrophils are an important source of factors chemotactic for T-lymphocytes. The polypeptides derived from neutrophil granules were identified as T-cell chemotactic factors: defensins NP-1 and −2 and CAP37/azurocidin. Defensins are a family of small (29-30 amino acids, approximately 3.5 kDa) cationic antimicrobial proteins (24.Lehrer R.I. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) whose structure is stabilized by three conserved disulfide bridges, including one disulfide that cyclizes the protein by linking the carboxyl-terminal cysteine to the amino-terminal ultimate (HNP-2) or penultimate (HNP-1, HNP-3) cysteine (29.Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 229-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Indeed the defensins HNP-1, HNP-2 and HNP-3 differ by only a single NH2-terminal amino acid. Approximately 25-30% of the human azurophilic granule protein consists of defensins. It has been estimated that up to 3-5 pg of defensins can be released by each neutrophil. They are believed to be released into the phagocytic vesicle of the neutrophil and into the medium (30.Ganz T. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 568-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where they contribute to the respiratory burst-independent cytotoxic killing of microbes. The cytotoxic effect of defensins occurs at micromolar concentrations and is thought to be due to their ability to form numerous transmembrane channels that permeabilize lipid bilayers of microorganisms. Even though their amino acid sequences are virtually identical, HNP-3 does not kill Candida albicans(31.Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Szklarek D. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) whereas HNP-1 and HNP-2 have been reported to have this activity. HNP-3 also lacked T-cell chemotactic activity, but cleavage of the amino-terminal aspartate residue can convert it into active HNP-2. CAP37/azurocidin, like defensins, was previously identified as a neutrophil granule protein also with antimicrobial activity at micromolar concentrations(32.Shafer W.M. Martin L.E. Spitznagel J.K. Infect. Immun. 1986; 53: 651-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 34.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Structurally, CAP37 belongs to the serine protease superfamily and has 45% sequence identity with human neutrophil elastase; however, due to replacements of crucial amino acids at the active site, CAP37/azurocidin is inactive as a protease (26.Gabay J.E. Scott R.W. Campanelli D. Griffith J. Wilde C. Marra M.N. Seeger M. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that there are any other T-cell chemotactic peptides present that we have not detected in the neutrophil granule extracts because the defensins and CAP37 are major protein constituents of neutrophil granules and are chemotactic at low (nanomolar) concentrations. Both the defensins HNP-1 and HNP-2 and CAP37/azurocidin have been reported to chemoattract monocytes(35.Territo M.C. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 2017-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 36.Pereira H.A. Shafer W.M. Pohl J. Martin L.E. Spitznagel J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1468-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, we have repeatedly been unable to detect any monocyte or neutrophil chemotaxis with doses of 1-1000 ng/ml defensins. The report that defensins chemoattract human monocytes is based on assays of the leading front of mononuclear cells migrating into a filter(35.Territo M.C. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 2017-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). It is difficult to identify cells lodging in a filter, and this may have led to a misidentification of the migrating mononuclear cell type. Our assay method more readily permits the identification of cells adhering to the underside of polycarbonate filters as T-cells. In the case of our preparations of natural CAP37/azurocidin and the purified and recombinant CAP37 (provided us by Dr. A. Pereira), we also could not detect significant monocyte chemotaxis (chemotaxis index ≤ 1.5). Perhaps this is based on technical discrepancies in our assays, or possibly tissue macrophages express more receptors for CAP37 than do human peripheral monocytes. However, we have identified another protein present in the chromatography fractions of the neutrophil granule extracts as having monocyte chemoattractant activity but not T-cell chemotactic activity. This protein migrates very closely to CAP37/azurocidin and may therefore have been a contaminant of CAP37 preparations that attract monocytes. ( 2O. Chertov, L. Xu, J. M. Wang, T. Sayers, and J. J. Oppenheim, manuscript in preparation.) Our data indicate that defensins and CAP37/azurocidin are potent in vitro T-cell chemoattractants. Because defensins account for 25-30% of the neutrophil granule protein content, they may serve as a major source of T-cell chemoattractant whose release is under the control of neutrophil activators such as IL-8. Although serum proteins effectively inactivate the antimicrobial activity of defensins, their in vitro chemotactic activity is not impaired by the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (data not shown). This predicts that defensins can deliver a T-lymphocyte activating signal at a distance from the site of acute inflammation where they originate. This prediction was borne out by our experiments showing that BALB/c mice injected subcutaneously with 1.0-μg injections of defensins or CAP37/azurocidin developed mononuclear as well as neutrophilic infiltrates by 4 h. By 24 h the number of accumulated neutrophils and mononuclear cells was markedly increased even in response to lower 10- or 100-ng doses. The infiltration by neutrophils and mononuclear cells was not predicted by the in vitro assays. It is possible that defensins and CAP37/azurocidin initiate a cascade of proinflammatory signals in vivo resulting in the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes. The inflammatory response may be a result of the tissue-damaging effects of these microbicidal agents, although necrosis became evident only at 24 h in response to the 1000-ng dose. In the case of the defensins, immunohistochemical studies revealed that in four of the six chimeric huPBL-SCID mice, CD3+ human T-cells appeared at the injection site already by 4 h. However, there are also unstained infiltrating mononuclear cells which are murine macrophages. These macrophages may express more receptors for human defensins and CAP37/azurocidin. The possibility that these agents are immunomodulators and may have adjuvant activity is currently being tested. Our quantitative assays of the Western blots revealed that IL-8, FMLP, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin resulted in comparable release of defensins by neutrophils in vitro. On the presumption that IL-8 induces similar degranulating effects in vivo, we therefore estimate that 2 × 106 neutrophils could release 600 ng of defensins in response to IL-8. This would produce a concentration gradient sufficient to attract T-lymphocytes. Preincubation of neutrophils with tumor necrosis factor-α has also been shown to augment the IL-8-stimulated degranulation of both azurophilic and specific granules of neutrophils(27.Brandt E. Petersen F. Flad H.-D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1356-1364PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that secondary inflammatory stimuli may have a priming effect on IL-8-stimulated degranulation and can thus enhance leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation. The physiological importance of these neutrophil granule T-lymphocyte chemoattractants remains to be established. Tantalizing clues are provided by an experiment of nature namely beige mutant mice with the Chédiak-SteinbrinckHigashi Syndrome. Beige mice have also been reported to be deficient in defensins(37.Gallin J.I. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Phagocytic Cells: Disorders of Function in Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1988: 493-511Google Scholar, 38.Saxena R.K. Saxena Q.B. Adler W.H. Nature. 1982; 295: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An even less common disorder, specific granule deficiency, is also characterized by a deficiency in defensins and increased susceptibility to microbial infections(39.Ganz T. Metcalf J.A. Gallin J.I. Boxer L.A. Lehrer R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The defective host defenses in these mice may be due in part to deficient secretion of defensins and CAP37/azurocidin. Our results indicate that the release of these proteins from neutrophils can be triggered by proinflammatory mediators, such as IL-8, in addition to the release caused by phagocytosis of microorganisms(30.Ganz T. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 568-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Territo M.C. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 2017-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The possibility that these potent T-lymphocyte chemoattractants can provide a means by which acute inflammatory reactions develop into immunologically mediated chronic inflammatory responses dominated by mononuclear cells is supported by data showing that depletion of neutrophils inhibits subsequent chronic inflammatory reactions in mice (17.Taub, D.

In the present study, we have examined the transport of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in membrane vesicles from MRP-transfected HeLa cells (T14), as well as drug-selected H69AR lung cancer cells which express high levels of MRP. Vmax and Km values for LTC4 transport by membrane vesicles from T14 cells were 529 ± 176 pmol mg−1 min−1 and 105 ± 31 nM, respectively. At 50 nM LTC4, the Km (ATP) was 70 μM. Transport in T14 vesicles was osmotically-sensitive and was supported by various nucleoside triphosphates but not by non- or slowly-hydrolyzable ATP analogs. LTC4 transport rates in membrane vesicles derived from H69AR cells and their parental and revertant variants were consistent with their relative levels of MRP expression. A 190-kDa protein in T14 membrane vesicles was photolabeled by [3H]LTC4 and immunoprecipitation with MRP-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) confirmed that this protein was MRP. LTC4 transport was inhibited by an MRP-specific mAb (QCRL-3) directed against an intracellular conformational epitope of MRP, but not by a mAb (QCRL-1) which recognizes a linear epitope. Photolabeling with [3H]LTC4 was also inhibitable by mAb QCRL-3 but not mAb QCRL-1. GSH did not inhibit LTC4 transport. However, the ability of alkylated GSH derivatives to inhibit transport increased markedly with the length of the alkyl group. S-Decylglutathione was a potent competitive inhibitor of [3H]LTC4 transport (Ki(app) 116 nM), suggesting that the two compounds bind to the same, or closely related, site(s) on MRP. Chemotherapeutic agents including colchicine, doxorubicin, and daunorubicin were poor inhibitors of [3H]LTC4 transport. Taxol, VP-16, vincristine, and vinblastine were also poor inhibitors of LTC4 transport but inhibition by these compounds was enhanced by GSH. Uptake of [3H]vincristine into T14 membrane vesicles in the absence of GSH was low and not dependent on ATP. However, in the presence of GSH, ATP-dependent vincristine transport was observed. Levels of transport increased with concentrations of GSH up to 5 mM. The identification of an MRP-specific mAb that inhibits LTC4 transport and prevents photolabeling of MRP by LTC4, provides conclusive evidence of the ability of MRP to transport cysteinyl leukotrienes.

(1.Loe, D. W., Deeley, R. G., Cole, S. P. C. (1996) Eur. J. Cancer, in pressGoogle Scholar), or by P-glycoprotein(2.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar). Both MRP and P-glycoprotein belong to the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily but share only approximately 15% amino acid identity(3.Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence suggests that P-glycoprotein reduces cellular drug accumulation by acting as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump(2.Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar, 4.Sharom F.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of action of MRP is much less certain. The ability to transport drugs directly into plasma membrane vesicles has been firmly established for P-glycoprotein(5.Doige C.A. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 6.Schlemmer S.R. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31059-31066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not for MRP. There is also no evidence that xenobiotics bind directly to MRP(7.McGrath T. Latoud C. Arnold S.T.

These observations suggest that these two ATP-binding cassette proteins may confer multidrug resistance by different mechanisms. multidrug resistance protein β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate adenosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) leukotriene C4 leukotriene B4 monoclonal antibody vincristine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Some insight into the normal physiological role of MRP has been obtained by the demonstration that membrane vesicles from MRP-overexpressing drug-selected and transfected cells support ATP-dependent transport of cysteinyl leukotrienes (e.g. LTC4) and certain other GSH S-conjugates(10.Leier I.

A. 1994; 91: 13033-13037Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Further evidence of a role for MRP in LTC4 transport was suggested by the observation that photolabeling of a 190-kDa protein with LTC4 in MRP-expressing cells is inhibited by MK571 (an inhibitor of LTC4 transport)(10.Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27807-27810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cysteinyl leukotrienes are potent mediators of inflammation that increase vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction(13.Keppler D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 121: 1-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LTC4 is synthesized from GSH and LTA4 by LTC4 synthase(14.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Vaillancourt J.P. Calaycay J.R. Mumford R.A. Zamboni R.J. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2015-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is then exported from the cell by an ATP-dependent transport mechanism(15.Schaub T. Ishikawa T. Keppler D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). LTC4 synthase and the LTC4 transporter protein are expressed in eosinophils and mast cells(16.Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), as well as endothelial cells(13.Keppler D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 121: 1-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LTC4 is also transported in the liver by at least two routes: uptake from the blood circulation into hepatocytes, and excretion from hepatocytes across canalicular membranes into the bile(13.Keppler D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 121: 1-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although current evidence strongly suggests that MRP mediates an active transport process, the mechanistic relationship between the involvement of MRP in GSH S-conjugate transport and its role in multidrug resistance is unclear. GSH conjugation is not known to be an important pathway for the biotransformation of chemotherapeutic agents to which MRP confers resistance and there is no evidence that this reaction occurs to any significant extent in tumor cells or drug-resistant tumor cell lines(17.Tew K.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4313-4320PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the mechanism by which MRP confers resistance to multiple drugs was investigated in a plasma membrane vesicle model system. For these studies, we used membrane vesicles from a population of HeLa cells, termed T14, which had been transfected with a MRP expression vector(8.Cole S.P.C. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Wilson G.M. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar). By using transfected cells as the source of membrane vesicles, those aspects of LTC4 and drug transport kinetics that are solely attributable to MRP overexpression can be identified(8.Cole S.P.C. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Wilson G.M. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 102-110PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial objective was to characterize MRP-mediated LTC4 transport in membrane vesicles from this new population of transfected HeLa cells so that subsequent studies of drug, or drug conjugate, transport could be evaluated within this context. We provide evidence that [3H]LTC4 binds specifically to MRP and demonstrate that a MRP-specific mAb inhibits both [3H]LTC4 transport and binding. We have also characterized the ability of alkylated GSH derivatives and hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agents to inhibit [3H]LTC4 transport. Finally, we show that GSH not only enhances the ability of vincristine to inhibit LTC4 transport, but also results in ATP-dependent transport of the drug itself. [14,15,19,20-3H]-LTC4 (128 Ci mmol−1) and [35S]methionine (710 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from DuPont NEN (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and [3H]vincristine (VCR) (6.9 Ci mmol−1) was from Amersham (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). LTB4, LTC4, VP-16, AMP, AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, ATPγS, GTP, CTP, UTP, colchicine, GSH, GSSG, and S-alkyl GSH derivatives were from Sigma. ATP, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and VCR were purchased from ICN Biochemicals (St. Laurent, PQ, Canada) and taxol was from Omicron BioChemicals (San Antonio, TX). Creatine phosphate and creatine kinase were from Boehringer Mannheim (Dorval, PQ, Canada). QCRL-3 is a IgG2a murine mAb that recognizes a conformation dependent epitope of MRP and has been described previously(19.Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar). The small cell lung cancer cell line H69, its doxorubicin-selected multidrug resistant H69AR, and the drug-sensitive revertant cell line, H69PR, have been described previously(3.Cole S.P.C.

The HeLa cells transfected with the pCEBV7 vector (C6) or the vector containing the MRP coding sequence pCEBV7-MRP1 (T14) have also been described(8.Cole S.P.C. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W.

All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% defined bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) in the absence of antibiotics, except for the transfected HeLa cells which were maintained in 100 μg ml−1 hygromycin B. In some experiments, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (300 μCi ml−1) as described(18.Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G.

Briefly, cells were homogenized in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM sucrose, 3 mM KCl, 0.25 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors(18.Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E.

Cell pellets were frozen at −70°C for at least 1 h, thawed, and then disrupted by N2 cavitation (10 min equilibration at 175 p.s.i.). EDTA was added to 1 mM and after centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was layered over 35% (w/w) sucrose in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (specific gravity, ~1.15 g cm−3) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The interface was collected and washed twice by centrifugation. The membrane pellet was resuspended in transport buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM sucrose, pH 7.5) and passed 20 times through a 27-gauge needle for vesicle formation. The resulting vesicles were enriched 4-8-fold in plasma membranes relative to the post-nuclear supernatant, as assessed by Na+,K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, and 5′-nucleotidase activities ((18.Almquist K.C.

Some contamination from endoplasmic reticulum was observed, as indicated by 2.3-fold enrichment of NADPH cytochrome c reductase. The sidedness of the membrane vesicles was assessed by determining the activities of two plasma membrane-associated ectoenzymes (alkaline phosphatase and 5′-nucleotidase) in the presence or absence of 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (18.Almquist K.C.

Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21719) Google Scholar) and it was determined that 30-34% of T14 PM vesicles were inside-out. T14 vesicles were treated with concanavalin A (1:1 (w/w) ratio) overnight at 4°C to agglutinate outside-out vesicles(24.Ruetz S. Raymond M. Gros P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11588-11592Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Following centrifugation to remove agglutinated material, the supernatant displayed a 2-fold increase in the rate of [3H]LTC4 uptake (see below), consistent with ATP-dependent transport being attributable to inside-out vesicles. ATP-dependent transport of LTC4 into membrane vesicles was measured by rapid filtration as described(16.Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), with modifications. Thawed membrane vesicles were diluted in transport buffer and passed 5 times through a 27-gauge needle. Standard transport assays were carried out at 23°C in a 120-μl volume containing 10 μg of vesicle protein, 4 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, an ATP regenerating system consisting of 10 mM creatine phosphate and 100 μg ml−1 creatine kinase, and [3H]LTC4 (50 nM; 100 nCi) in transport buffer. At the indicated times, 20-μl aliquots were removed and added to 1 ml of ice-cold transport buffer, which was then filtered through nitrocellulose filters (0.22 μm) on a Hoeffer filtration manifold under vacuum. Filters were immediately washed twice with 5 ml of cold transport buffer, solubilized, and radioactivity determined. [3H]LTC4 uptake was expressed relative to the protein concentration of the membrane vesicles(25.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). All data were corrected for the amount of [3H]LTC4 that remained bound to the filter in the absence of vesicle protein, which was usually 5-10% of the total radioactivity. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]VCR (200 nM; 70 nCi) was measured as described for [3H]LTC4 except that 100-120 μg of vesicle protein was used and the incubations were carried out at 37°C. In some experiments, GSH (1-5 mM) was added to the transport buffer. Uptake of [3H]VCR was stopped by rapid dilution in transport buffer and immediate filtration through glass fiber (Type A/E) filters (Gelman Sciences, Dorval, PQ), which had been presoaked overnight at 37°C in 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin(5.Doige C.A. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were photolabeled with [3H]LTC4 essentially as described(16.Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, vesicles prepared from different cell types (150 μg of membrane protein in 50 μl) were incubated with [3H]LTC4 (0.5 μCi, 78 nM) at room temperature for 10 min and frozen in liquid N2. Samples were alternately irradiated for 30 s at 312 nm in a Stratalinker, followed by snap-freezing in liquid N2, for a total of 10 min. A portion of the radiolabeled proteins was immunoprecipitated with a mixture of MRP-specific mAbs QCRL-1, QCRL-2, and QCRL-3(19.Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were solubilized in Laemmli's buffer and radiolabeled proteins (100 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and gels were subjected to fluorography. To determine whether unlabeled LTC4, LTB4, mAb QCRL-3, or mouse IgG2a (isotype control) could inhibit [3H]LTC4 labeling, T14 membrane vesicles were coincubated with these reagents and [3H]LTC4 for 10 min at room temperature prior to irradiation and SDS-PAGE. The time course and ATP dependence of [3H]LTC4 accumulation by vesicles prepared from HeLa T14 cells is shown in Fig. 1A. Accumulation was measured at room temperature with an initial concentration of 50 nM LTC4 in the presence of 4 mM ATP or AMP. No cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+) were present and the membrane potential was not experimentally manipulated. ATP-dependent uptake was rapid, linear up to 30 s and approached steady-state after 90 s (not shown). During the linear phase, the rate of ATP-dependent uptake was approximately 150 pmol mg−1 min−1. Increasing the amount of vesicle protein resulted in rates of uptake which were difficult to quantify because of the short duration of linearity. Similarly, quantification was difficult if the experiments were carried out at 37°C rather than room temperature because of high initial rates of transport and rapid depletion of extravesicular LTC4. The ATP-dependent rate of LTC4 uptake in T14 vesicles was at least 100-fold higher than in vesicles from control C6 cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the low levels of uptake in T14 vesicles in the presence of AMP were similar to those observed for C6 membrane vesicles with or without ATP. The correlation between LTC4 transport and levels of MRP expression was also examined by measuring rates of LTC4 uptake in vesicles isolated from drug-sensitive H69, drug-resistant H69AR, and revertant H69PR cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, the rate of ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake in H69AR vesicles was approximately 2-fold faster than for T14 vesicles and was below the limits of detection in vesicles from H69 cells. Low levels of ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake could be detected in H69PR vesicles (approximately 1.5 pmol mg−1 min−1 at room temperature) (Fig. 1C) where the levels of MRP are 3-5-fold higher than in H69 cells(3.Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M.V. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar, 19.Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles from human 8226/Dox40 cells also exhibited levels of [3H]LTC4 transport comparable to those of H69PR-derived vesicles (approximately 2 pmol mg−1 min−1) (Fig. 1D). These cells overexpress P-glycoprotein and contain low levels of MRP similar to those found in H69PR cells (data not shown). To confirm that LTC4 accumulation reflected transport of substrate into the vesicle lumen, rather than surface or intramembrane binding, the effect of extravesicular osmolarity on [3H]LTC4 uptake was measured. As shown in Fig. 2A, the rate of [3H]LTC4 uptake in T14 vesicles was clearly osmotically-sensitive. To establish the nucleotide dependence of LTC4 transport and to determine whether ATP hydrolysis was required, [3H]LTC4 uptake was measured in the presence of various nucleoside triphosphates and non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs. As shown in Fig. 2B, AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, and ATPγS (4 mM) were unable to support LTC4 uptake, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is necessary for transport. Of the four nucleoside triphosphates tested, LTC4 uptake was most efficient in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2B). Since the activity of many ATPases is often maintained when other divalent cations are substituted for Mg2+, we investigated the level of ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 transport in T14 vesicles in the presence of Mn2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Ba2+, and Zn2+ (10 mM). The relative ability of these cations to support LTC4 transport correlated well with their abilities to support ATP hydrolysis by known ATPases. Thus, when Mn2+, Ca2+, or Co2+ were substituted for Mg2+, the [3H]LTC4 transport rates were measureable but reduced by 25, 50, and 65%, respectively, whereas Cd2+, Ba2+, and Zn2+ did not support transport (Fig. 2C). The inability of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs to support MRP-mediated LTC4 uptake and the effect of substituting various cations for Mg2+ suggests that ATP hydrolysis, rather than just ATP-binding, is necessary for transport. Consequently, transport activity might be expected to be sensitive to inhibitors of certain classes of ATPases. For this reason, we examined the effects of the P-type ATPase inhibitor sodium vanadate, the Na+,K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain, and the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide. [3H]LTC4 uptake was insensitive to ouabain and vanadate at concentrations up to 1 mM. Preincubation of membrane vesicles with 1 mMN-ethylmaleimide at 23°C had no effect, but at 37°C, [3H]LTC4 uptake was inhibited by 70%. This observation suggests that at least one cysteine residue may be important for transport, as has been shown for other transport ATPases (26.Blumrich M. Petzinger E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1029: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rates of uptake were measured at several LTC4 concentrations (12.5-1000 nM) to determine Km and Vmax for [3H]LTC4 transport in T14 membrane vesicles. As shown in Fig. 3A (inset), a Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot yielded an apparent Km of 77 nM for LTC4 and a Vmax of 291 pmol mg−1 min−1. The average values (±S.E.) for Km and Vmax for six experiments were 105 ± 31 nM and 529 ± 176 pmol min−1 mg−1, respectively. This Km value is in good agreement with that reported previously for vesicles from human MRP-transfected HeLa T5 cells (97 nM)(10.Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27807-27810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for [3H]LTC4 transport in murine mastocytoma membrane vesicles (70 nM) (16.Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The Vmax obtained with T14 vesicles is approximately 5-fold higher than the value previously reported for vesicles prepared from HeLa T5 cells transfected with a different MRP expression vector (100 pmol min−1 mg−1)(10.Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27807-27810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of MRP in T14 cells are 2-fold higher than in T5 cells (15.Schaub T. Ishikawa T. Keppler D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) which may explain the differences in Vmax. However, it is also possible that differences in procedures used to prepare vesicles may contribute to the higher Vmax values obtained with T14 vesicles. The apparent Km for ATP (70 μM) was determined by measuring initial rates of [3H]LTC4 uptake at 30 s in the presence of different concentrations of the nucleotide (2-4000 μM) (Fig. 3B, inset). Previous studies have shown that LTC4 will bind to a 190-kDa protein enriched in membranes from MRP transfected cells(10.Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27807-27810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate conclusively that the labeled 190-kDa protein was MRP, T14 vesicles were incubated with [3H]LTC4, uv irradiated to cross-link bound LTC4, and solubilized membranes were immunoprecipitated with MRP-specific mAbs(19.Hipfner D.R. Gauldie S.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5788-5792PubMed Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE of the immunoprecipitate, a [3H]LTC4-labeled 190-kDa protein (Fig. 4A, lane 3) was detected which co-migrated with [35S]methionine-labeled MRP immunoprecipitated with the same mAbs (Fig. 4A, lane 1). In addition, the MRP-specific mAb QCRL-3, which recognizes a conformation-dependent epitope, inhibited [3H]LTC4 uptake with an IC50 of 5 μg ml−1 (50 ng of mAb ×μg protein−1) (Fig. 4B). The MRP-specific mAb QCRL-1, which recognizes a linear MRP epitope, had no effect on LTC4 transport (not shown) nor did isotype control immunoglobulins up to 30 μg ml−1. To examine the specificity of the interaction between LTC4 and MRP, the ability of unlabeled LTC4 or the unconjugated leukotriene, LTB4, to compete for [3H]LTC4 labeling of membrane proteins was determined (Fig. 4C). In the absence of competitor, photolabeling of MRP was readily detectable in H69AR (Fig. 4C, lane 2) and T14 (Fig. 4C, lane 4), but not in C6 membranes (Fig. 4C, lane 3), as expected. The relative degree of labeling was consistent with the relative level of MRP in these cells. Photolabeling was inhibited by excess unlabeled LTC4 (Fig. 4C, lane 5), but not LTB4 (Fig. 4C, lane 6). Labeling was also inhibited by mAb QCRL-3 (Fig. 4C, lane 7) at a concentration which abolishes [3H]LTC4 transport (100 ng ×μg protein−1). MAb QCRL-1 did not inhibit photolabeling (not shown), consistent with its inability to inhibit LTC4 transport. Finally, to exclude the possibility that LTC4 labeling of MRP was an artifact resulting from nonspecific labeling of an abundant integral membrane protein, labeling experiments were carried out with 8226/Dox40 vesicles known to contain high levels of P-glycoprotein. As shown in Fig. 4C (lane 1), no labeling with [3H]LTC4 was observed. It has been reported previously that the transporter(s) responsible for GSH S-conjugate in sarcolemmal (27.Ishikawa T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1570865673,"In addition to its ability to confer resistance to a range of natural product type chemotherapeutic agents, multidrug resistance protein (MRP) has been shown to transport the cysteinyl leukotriene, LTC4, and several other glutathione (GSH) S-conjugates. We now demonstrate that its range of potential physiological substrates also includes cholestatic glucuronidated steroids. ATP dependent, osmotically sensitive transport of the naturally occurring conjugated estrogen, 17β-estradiol 17-(β-D-glucuronide) (E217βG), was readily demonstrable in plasma membrane vesicles from populations of MRP-transfected HeLa cells (Vmax 1.4 nmol mg−1 min−1, Km 2.5 μM). The involvement of MRP was confirmed by demonstrating that transport was completely inhibited by a monoclonal antibody specific for an intracellular conformational epitope of the protein. MRP-mediated transport of LTC4 was competitively inhibited by E217βG (Ki(app) 22 μM), despite the lack of structural similarity between these two substrates. Competitive inhibition of [3H]E217βG transport was also observed with a number of other cholestatic conjugated steroids. All of these compounds prevented photolabeling of MRP with [3H]LTC4, demonstrating that the cholestatic steroid and leukotriene conjugates compete either for the same or possibly overlapping sites on the protein. Consistent with the presence of overlapping but non-identical sites, studies using chemotherapeutic drugs to inhibit MRP-mediated E217βG transport indicated that daunorubicin had the highest relative potency of the drugs tested, whereas it was the least potent inhibitor of LTC4 transport. Non-cholestatic steroids glucuronidated at the 3 position of the steroid nucleus, such as 17β-estradiol 3-(β-D-glucuronide), did not compete for transport of E217βG by MRP, nor did they inhibit photolabeling of the protein with [3H]LTC4.

https://openalex.org/W1497340641,"Previous studies showed that the keratan sulfate-containing proteoglycans of bovine corneal stroma contain three unique core proteins designated 37A, 37B, and 25 (Funderburgh, J. L., Funderburgh, M. L., Mann, M. M., and Conrad, G. W.(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14226-14231). Degenerate oligonucleotides designed from amino acid sequences of the 37A protein were used to screen a cDNA expression library from cultured bovine keratocytes. A cDNA clone coding for keratocan, a 37A protein, was isolated and sequenced. The deduced keratocan amino acid sequence is unique but related to two other keratan sulfate-containing proteins, lumican (the 37B core protein) and fibromodulin. These three proteins share approximately 35% amino acid identity and a number of conserved structural features. Northern hybridization and immunoblotting of tissue extracts found keratocan distribution to be more limited than that of lumican or fibromodulin. Keratocan is abundant in cornea and sclera and detected in much lesser amounts in skin, ligament, cartilage, artery, and striated muscles. Only in cornea was keratocan found to contain large, sulfated keratan sulfate chains. Keratocan, like lumican, is a core protein of a major corneal proteoglycan but is present in non-corneal tissues primarily as a non-sulfated glycoprotein. Previous studies showed that the keratan sulfate-containing proteoglycans of bovine corneal stroma contain three unique core proteins designated 37A, 37B, and 25 (Funderburgh, J. L., Funderburgh, M.

Keratocan, like lumican, is a core protein of a major corneal proteoglycan but is present in non-corneal tissues primarily as a non-sulfated glycoprotein. Proteoglycans of the corneal stroma are important in maintaining the transparency of the cornea. These complex molecules are responsible for the hydrophilic character of the tissue, providing tissue hydration that is essential for transparency(1.Hedbys B.O. Exp. Eye Res. 1961; 1: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is not surprising, therefore, that the corneal stroma has a markedly different proteoglycan composition than that of other fibrous connective tissues such as skin and sclera. The unique character of corneal proteoglycans was recognized almost 60 years ago with the initial description of keratan sulfate, the most abundant glycosaminoglycan in the cornea(2.Suzuki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1939; 30: 185-191Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Corneal keratan sulfate is a highly sulfated, linear polymer of N-acetyllactosamine, linked to asparagine residues in the KSPG 1The abbreviation used is: KSPGkeratan sulfate proteoglycan. core proteins via a mannose-containing oligosaccharide(3.Stein T.

Because the keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans are posttranslational modifications of the KSPG proteins, determination of the structure and tissue-specific expression of these core proteins are essential to understanding the biological roles of KSPG. Research from our laboratory has demonstrated the existence of three KSPG proteins in bovine cornea. These proteins (designated 37A, 37B, and 25) have unique primary structures and differ in glycosylation, with protein 37A containing three keratan sulfate chains and the other two proteins containing one keratan sulfate chain each(5.Funderburgh J.L.

This DNA was isolated by screening a cDNA library with degenerate oligonucleotides representing amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides from bovine corneal KSPG protein 37A. The deduced amino acid sequence, size of mRNA, and tissue distribution of keratocan differentiate it from lumican. Preparation of stromal cell (keratocyte) cultures from bovine cornea was described previously(6.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Brown S.J. Vergnes J.P. Hassell J.R. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol.

Cells (passage 12-15) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamicin), and ITS (insulin, transferrin, and selenous acid) and harvested 1 week after confluency by trypsinization. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the cultured cells using the FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Briefly, cells were incubated at 45°C in buffer containing SDS, RNase inhibitor, and proteinase K. Poly(A)+ RNA was adsorbed on oligo(dT)-cellulose at room temperature, eluted from the oligo(dT)-cellulose with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, and stored at −70°C. Total RNA was isolated from cultured keratocytes and from various bovine tissues after pulverization in liquid nitrogen and homogenization in a denaturing solution containing 4 M guanidine isothiocyanate, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Sarkosyl, and 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0(8.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The homogenate was mixed with 0.1 × volume 2 M sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and then extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). RNA was ethanol-precipitated from the aqueous phase, and carbohydrates were extracted with 4 M LiCl. After reprecipitation with isopropyl alcohol, RNA was dissolved in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, and stored at −70°C. A cDNA library was constructed using the Uni-ZAP XR kit (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA). Keratocyte poly(A)+ RNA (6 μg) was reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer-linker containing an XhoI restriction site. The cDNA was made double-stranded and then ligated to EcoRI adaptors. The cDNA was digested with XhoI, and then molecules greater than 600 base pairs in length were selected by Sephacryl S-400 spin columns and agarose gel electrophoresis. The cDNA was inserted unidirectionally into the EcoRI/XhoI-digested λ vector, and the product was packaged into phage particles and transfected into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF′. The library contained more than 5 × 106 primary plaque-forming units with >95% recombinants and was amplified once on NZY agar (9.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

The membranes were prehybridized overnight at 42°C in prehybridization solution containing 6 × SSC (SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.010 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5 × Denhardt's solution(9.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.1Google Scholar), 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% SDS. The oligonucleotide probe FSNL, end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP to a specific activity of >2 × 108 cpm/μg, was diluted to 1 × 106 cpm/ml of prehybridization solution, and the membranes were hybridized at temperatures decreasing from 60 to 37°C over a period of 2-2.5 days. The membranes were washed in 6 × SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 1 h with three changes of wash solution and then washed again under the same conditions except that the temperature was raised to 37°C. Positive clones were rescreened with probe IWYL using the same methods at a density of 200-300 plaques/100-mm plate to ensure isolation of pure plaques. The pBluescript plasmid containing the cDNA insert was released from the Uni-Zap XR bacteriophage by coinfecting E. coli XL1-Blue cells with purified phage and ExAssist helper phage. The inserts were excised from purified plasmid DNA by digestion with EcoRI and XhoI, and their sizes were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. The sequence of the cDNA insert was determined using an Applied Biosystems sequencer and the walking primer method(9.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.1Google Scholar). The sequence was read at least two times in each direction. Total RNA (10 μg) from keratocyte cultures and various bovine tissues was subjected to electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde (9.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.1Google Scholar) and blotted onto nylon membrane using a Turboblotter apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). Northern blot filters were prehybridized overnight at 42°C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 6 × SSC, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.8, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured herring or salmon sperm DNA, and 10% dextran sulfate. Filters were hybridized in the same solution at 42°C for 21-22 h. An 872-base pair cDNA insert probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction from clone 3710, α-32P-labeled to a specific activity of >1 × 109 cpm/μg DNA, and used at 1 × 106 cpm/ml of the above solution. Filters were washed three times with 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 50°C each wash, then twice with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS using the same conditions. They were exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) at −70°C for 8-24 h. To assay a second mRNA on the same blot, membranes were stripped of labeled probe in 0.1% SDS at 100°C, and the solution was allowed to cool to room temperature. Complete stripping of labeled probe was confirmed by exposure to film for 2 days before rehybridization. Five mg of a synthetic peptide (RSVRQVYEASDPEDWTMHC) corresponding to the deduced 18 N-terminal amino acids of mature 37A protein with an added C-terminal cysteine was dissolved in 6 M guanidine HCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, 0.005 M EDTA, pH 8.5, and reduced with 0.1 M dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37°C. The peptide was separated from the dithiothreitol by gel filtration and immediately reacted with 2 ml of iodoacetyl-derivatized agarose gel (SulfoLink Gel, Pierce) for 16 h at room temperature. The excess binding sites were quenched with 0.05 M cysteine in the same buffer. For affinity purification, 1 ml of a γ-globulin fraction of antiserum against bovine KSPG was allowed to bind to a 2-ml column of the peptide affinity gel for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and the specific antibody was eluted with 3.5 M KSCN, 0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 8. Protein-containing fractions were dialyzed to phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to a second round of purification on the same gel. The purified antibody was stored at −70°C in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Tissues from slaughter-aged steers were minced and extracted in 10 volumes of 4 M guanidine HCl in the presence of protease inhibitors(10.Conrad G.W. Ager-Johnson P. Woo M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 464-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were dialyzed to 6 M urea containing 0.1 M Tris phosphate, pH 6.8, and stored frozen at −20°C. Before electrophoresis, the extracts were treated overnight at 4°C with 0.015 unit/ml affinity-purified endo-β-galactosidase(11.Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3900-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 7.5-15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously(12.Jost C.J. Funderburgh J.L. Mann M. Hassell J.R. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13336-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total proteins on the nitrocellulose were stained with 0.1% Ponceau S in 0.1% acetic acid and photographed, and then the membrane was incubated in 10% nonfat powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 30-60 min. Further procedures were carried out in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% thimerosal, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.15 M NaCl. The membrane was incubated 14-18 h at 4°C with 1% bovine serum albumin and diluted primary antibody. After rinsing 3 times for 10 min each, membranes were incubated for 2-4 h at room temperature with affinity-purified, peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). The membranes were rinsed as before, and peroxidase activity was detected using a luminescent peroxidase substrate (ECL Reagent, Amersham Life Science, Inc.) and exposure to x-ray film. We used tryptic peptide sequences from the bovine KSPG core protein 37A to design degenerate oligonucleotide probes, two of which hybridized to clones in a cDNA library constructed from cultured bovine keratocytes. Thirteen clones hybridized to FSNL, a 128-fold degenerate, 20-base oligonucleotide probe; and two of these hybridized to IWYL, a 256-fold degenerate, 26-base oligonucleotide probe. The two clones (designated 3709 and 3710) that hybridized to both probes were found to be identical on initial sequencing, and clone 3710 was chosen for complete sequence analysis. The nucleotide sequence of the clone 3710 insert is shown in Fig. 1. The IWYL and FSNL probe sequences are located starting at nucleotides 445 and 671, respectively. The longest open reading frame is shown as a 352-amino acid protein. This predicted protein contains the amino acid sequences (underlined in Fig. 1) of all three tryptic peptides (IWYL, FSNL, and NVXV) previously identified in bovine corneal 37A protein(5.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 20 most N-terminal amino acids have characteristics of a signal peptide(13.von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar), predicting a mature protein of 332 amino acids with a molecular mass of 38,047 Da. This size corresponds closely to the experimentally determined molecular mass of the 37A core protein(5.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alignment of the cDNA sequences for lumican and 37A (not shown) found no significant regions of identity, indicating that 37A and lumican do not arise as a result of alternate splicing of a single RNA transcript. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of 37A and lumican (Fig. 2) revealed a 37% amino acid identity between the two bovine core proteins. These identities are dispersed throughout the sequence and not in contiguous groups. The 37A protein contains structural features similar to those in lumican. These include four closely spaced cysteines (37A residues 42, 46, 48, and 58) at the N-terminal region and 11 leucine-rich repeats with consensus sequence of LXXLXLXXNXL (where X is any amino acid and L is leucine or another hydrophobic amino acid). Two conserved cysteine residues flank the 11th leucine-rich repeat at the C-terminal region (residues 303 and 343). The 37A protein contains a tyrosine followed by an acidic amino acid (Glu) near the N terminus (residue 27), a consensus sequence for tyrosine sulfation (14.Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16859-16861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also found in lumican. Five consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation are present in the 37A sequence (residues 93, 167, 222, 260, and 298); three of these (93, 167, and 260) match the locations of those in lumican. A BLAST search of protein sequence data bases revealed four bovine proteins closely related to the deduced sequence of 37A. Fig. 3 presents a graphic comparison of amino acid sequence similarity among these five related bovine proteins. The 37A protein sequence is most similar to that of lumican and fibromodulin, both of which bear keratan sulfate chains. The dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan, were less closely related to the 37A protein, involving only 10-15% identity. Electroporetically separated total RNA from cultured corneal keratocytes and various bovine tissues was transferred to nylon membranes and probed with 37A cDNA. The blot was stripped and reprobed with lumican cDNA to determine the size and relative abundance of the mRNA transcripts of these two genes. Fig. 4 shows that the 37A cDNA hybridized to a 2.5-kilobase transcript (Fig. 4A), whereas the lumican cDNA hybridized to a 2.4-kilobase (Fig. 4B) transcript. Relative intensity of labeling differed between the two probes, indicating differing abundance of the mRNAs for these proteins in different tissues. The highest levels of 37A hybridization were detected with RNA from the cornea and sclera. Lower levels of this transcript were detected, in decreasing order, in cultured keratocytes, skin, ligamentum nuchae, and skeletal muscle. Longer exposure of the films also detected 37A mRNA in nasal cartilage and cardiac muscle. The lumican transcript (Fig. 4B) was abundant in cornea and cultured keratocytes and somewhat stronger in sclera. This transcript also was found, in decreasing order, in ligamentum nuchae, skin, lung, aorta, cardiac muscle, kidney, and skeletal muscle. In extended exposures, lumican mRNA was also detected in cartilage, coronary artery, and intestine. Lumican and 37A transcripts showed different relative abundance in bovine keratocyte cultures compared with those in corneal RNA. In corneal RNA, lumican and 37A transcripts hybridized with equal intensity, whereas lumican mRNA appeared to be more abundant than 37A mRNA in cultured keratocytes. Detection of 37A proteins was carried out with antibody to KSPG that was affinity-purified using a synthetic peptide representing the predicted 20 N-terminal amino acids of the mature protein. The specificity of the affinity-purified antibody was examined (Fig. 5) by Western blotting with purified KSPG core proteins. Lanes 1 and 3 each contain a fraction with core proteins 37A and 25, whereas lanes 2 and 4 each contain 37B, lumican. The unfractionated antiserum (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2) contained antibodies that recognized all three KSPG proteins. The 37A affinity-purified antibody (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4) bound only the 37A protein, demonstrating its specificity. In Fig. 6, the anti-37A antibody was used to stain immunoblots of unpurified, endo-β-galactosidase-treated tissue extracts from a range of bovine tissues. The 37A protein was detected as broad and occasionally heterogeneous bands in the range of 48-52 kDa. Cornea and sclera contained the most intensely stained 37A proteins. Skin, cartilage, skeletal muscle, tendon, and aorta all showed lesser amounts of the 37A protein. The size of the fully glycosylated 37A glycoprotein was examined in the experiment shown in Fig. 7, in which intact, partially purified 37A proteins were separated by electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and then treated with endo-β-galactosidase to unmask the 37A epitope. Under these conditions, the 37A from cornea exhibited a broad size heterogeneity from 60 to >200 kDa, confirming the presence of high molecular weight keratan sulfate chains on the native 37A protein in cornea(5.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 37A from skin, sclera, and aorta, on the other hand, appeared as broad bands in the 60-70-kDa range, indicating a clear difference in the glycosylation of the 37A protein between corneal and non-corneal tissues.Figure 6:Detection of 37A protein in bovine tissues. Extracts of bovine tissues in 6 M urea were treated with endo-β-galactosidase, then fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, and subjected to immunoblotting with the affinity-purified anti-37A antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Size of marker proteins (in kDa) is shown on the left.

Size of marker proteins (in kDa) is given on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our previous studies have demonstrated that bovine corneal KSPG is a mixture of at least three unique core proteins. Our current data confirm that two of these three are structurally similar proteins that arise from unique messenger RNAs. The lack of significant regions of identity between lumican and 37A mRNAs indicates that they do not arise as a result of alternate splicing. The most reasonable interpretation of these data is that the 37A and lumican proteins are products of different genes. This interpretation is confirmed by recent studies that found lumican (15.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Hevelone N.D. Stech M.D. Justice M.J. Liu C.-Y. Kao W.W.-Y. Conrad G.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 2296-2303PubMed Google Scholar) and 37A 2M. J. Justice, personal communication. genes to map at different chromosomal loci in the mouse. We propose the name “keratocan” for the 37A gene because only in the cornea does the protein assume the form of a proteoglycan. The keratocan gene appears to be the newest member of the family of proteoglycans containing leucine-rich repeat motifs. These proteins each contain an N-terminal hypervariable region, six highly conserved cysteines, and 11 leucine-rich repeats(6.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Brown S.J. Vergnes J.P. Hassell J.R. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11874-11880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are now five bovine proteins in this group for which cDNA sequences have been determined. Amino acid sequence similarities suggest two subgroups within this family of proteins. Keratocan, fibromodulin, and lumican (all keratan sulfate proteoglycans) are in one group, and decorin and biglycan (dermatan sulfate proteoglycans) are in the other (Fig. 3). This grouping also appears to be reflected at the genomic level. The genes for decorin and biglycan contain 8 exons(16.Fisher L.W. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press, London1993: 103-114Google Scholar), whereas those for fibromodulin and lumican contain 3 exons(17.Grover J. Chen X.N. Korenberg J.R. Roughley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21942-21949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18.Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 204-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Another feature that differentiates these groups is the presence of consensus sites for tyrosine sulfation. Keratocan, lumican, and fibromodulin each contain at least one tyrosine followed by an acidic amino acid (Asp or Glu) in the N-terminal (hypervariable) portion of the molecule. In the case of fibromodulin, these tyrosines have been shown to be sulfated(14.Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16859-16861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In keratocan, a single potentially sulfated tyrosine is found at amino acid residue 27 (Fig. 2). Similar tyrosine residues are absent in biglycan and decorin. The presence of potentially sulfated tyrosines in all three keratan sulfate-containing proteins and their absence in the dermatan sulfate proteoglycans suggest the possibility that sulfated tyrosine may provide a signal for posttranslational addition of keratan sulfate chains. This family of related proteoglycans currently has five known members, but it is highly likely that more exist. A BLAST search of GenBank™ sequences similar to keratocan identified an unpublished sequence (accession number U29089) from a human cartilage cDNA library that codes for a protein with an amino acid sequence very similar to those for the three keratan sulfate-containing members of the family (not shown). In addition, amino acid sequences from tryptic fragments of the third corneal KSPG core protein (the 25-kDa protein) indicate that it may also be a member of this group(5.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lumican and keratocan both have a characteristic unlike other known proteoglycans. In the cornea, these proteins are core proteins of corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan and bear long, highly sulfated keratan sulfate chains. In the other tissues in which they are found, however, these proteins occur as poorly sulfated or non-sulfated glycoproteins. Lumican from the artery contains oligomeric N-acetyllactosamine, essentially a non-sulfated form of keratan sulfate (19.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24773-24777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data (Fig. 7) suggest that keratocan, like lumican, contains short, non-sulfated poly(N-acetyllactosamine) chains in tissues other than cornea. The different abundance and tissue localization of these two proteins suggest that, outside of the cornea, they may have different functions. In the cornea, however, both proteins have been recruited into the unique KSPG molecules thought to be essential for corneal transparency. The specialized nature of the KSPG form of these two proteins may be inferred from their pattern of glycosylation. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies of ribonuclease inhibitor, another leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, show that the repeats in this protein form β-sheets in the hydrophobic core of the molecule, whereas the intervening sequences form α helices on the exterior of the molecule(20.Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Lumican and keratocan have three conserved consensus sites for N-glycosylation (Fig. 2). Each of these occurs between leucine-rich repeats, therefore making these sites candidates for the addition of keratan sulfate chains. Our previous work showed that corneal lumican contains one keratan sulfate chain and that keratocan contains three(5.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pattern of post-translational addition of keratan sulfate indicates a high level of selectivity in terms of both the individual proteins involved and of choice of sites to which keratan sulfate is added. Such a level of targeting suggests the presence in keratocytes of a unique glycosylation system involved in biosynthesis of corneal KSPG. Understanding the nature of this system and the signals that initiate its action are important goals in understanding the role of KSPG in the cornea and the biochemical mechanisms by which this role is maintained. Note Added in Proof-Since submission of this manuscript, a description of the Protein U29089 was published (Bengtsson, E., Neame, P. J., Heinegard, D., and Sommarin, Y.(1995) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2028888447,"Rse, Ax1, and c-Mer comprise a family of cell adhesion molecule-related tyrosine kinase receptors. Human Gas6 was recently shown to act as a ligand for both human Rse (Godowski et al., 1995) and human Ax1 (Varnum et al., 1995). Gas6 contains an NH2-terminal Gla domain followed by four epidermal growth factor-like repeats and tandem globular (G) domains. The G domains are related to those found in sex hormone-binding globulin and to those utilized by laminin and agrin for binding to the dystroglycan complex. A series of Gas6 variants were tested for their ability to bind to Rse and Ax1. The Gla domain and epidermal growth factor-like repeats were not required for receptor binding, as deletion variants of Gas6 which lacked these domains bound to the extracellular domains of both Rse and Axl. A deletion variant of Gas6 containing just the G domain region was shown to activate Rse phosphorylation. These results provide evidence that G domains can act as signaling molecules by activating transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, they provide a structural link between the activation of cell adhesion related receptors and the control of cell growth and differentiation by the G domain-containing superfamily of proteins."

Our results raise the possibility of a mutually exclusive association of CyP-40 and FKBP52 with hsp90. This would lead to separate immunophilin-hsp90-receptor complexes and place the estrogen receptor under the control of distinct immunophilin signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2089270902,"Addition of high concentrations (>1 mm) of inorganic phosphate (Pi) or arsenate to Ca2+-loaded mitochondria was followed by increased rates of H2O2 production, membrane lipid peroxidation, and swelling. Mitochondrial swelling was only partially prevented either by butylhydroxytoluene, an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, or cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This swelling was totally prevented by the simultaneous presence of these compounds. At lower Pi concentrations (1 mm), mitochondrial swelling is reversible and prevented by cyclosporin A, but not by butylhydroxytoluene. In any case (low or high phosphate concentration) exogenous catalase prevented mitochondrial swelling, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) participate in these mechanisms. Altogether, the data suggest that, at low Pi concentrations, membrane permeabilization is reversible and mediated by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, whereas at high Pi concentrations, membrane permeabilization is irreversible because lipid peroxidation also takes place. Under these conditions, lipid peroxidation is strongly inhibited by sorbate, a putative quencher of triplet carbonyl species. This suggests that high Pi or arsenate concentrations stimulate propagation of the peroxidative reactions initiated by mitochondrial-generated ROS because these anions are able to catalyze Cn-aldehyde tautomerization producing enols, which can be oxidized by hemeproteins to yield the lower Cn - 1-aldehyde in the triplet state. This proposition was also supported by experiments using a model system consisting of phosphatidylcholine/dicethylphosphate liposomes and the triplet acetone-generating system isobutanal/horseradish peroxidase, where phosphate and Ca2+ cooperate to increase the yield of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances."
https://openalex.org/W2094438579,"The Lewis histo-blood group system comprises two major antigens, Lewis a and Lewis b. The Lewis b antigen is a product of two fucosyltransferases, the α(1,3/1,4)fucosyltransferase (Lewis enzyme; Fuc-TIII) encoded by the Lewis gene and an α(1,2)fucosyltransferase which is not required for synthesis of Lewis a antigen. An enzyme responsible for secreting ABH antigens into body secretions (secretor enzyme) is also one of α(1,2)fucosyltransferases. A candidate gene encoding secretor enzyme Sec2 gene was recently cloned by Rouquier, S., Lowe, J. B., Kelly, R. J., Fertitta, A. L., Lennon, G. G., and Giorgi, D. ((1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 4632-4639) and Kelly, R. J., Rouquier, S., Giorgi, D., Lennon, G. G., and Lowe, J. B. ((1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 4640-4649) who demonstrated a G428A nonsense mutation (Trp▲ to terminal codon) in Sec2 of nonsecretors. However, the G428A nonsense mutation discovered in the Sec2 gene of nonsecretors in an ethnic group other than Japanese was not found in any of 45 Japanese nonsecretors, whereas one Filipino who had been erroneously registered as a Japanese possessed the G428A mutation heterozygously.In order to explore the Sec2 gene of a Japanese population, we performed a molecular genetic analysis of the Sec2 gene on 226 Japanese individuals, 21 in a family study and 205 in a random sampling study. We discovered two novel mutations in the Sec2 gene, an A385T missense mutation (Ile129 to Phe) that results in inactivation of Sec2-encoded α(1,2)fucosyltransferase and a C357T silent mutation which is irrelevant to amino acid substitution, in Japanese nonsecretors.The analysis of Japanese individuals using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method found three alleles in the Sec2 gene, the first having no mutation, the second having a C357T mutation, and the third having both C357T and A385T mutations, which we designated as Se1, Se2, and sej, respectively. Among 226 Japanese individuals, 40 having a Le(a+b-) phenotype and 5 having a Le(a-b-) nonsecretor phenotype were homozygous for sej/sej, whereas 149 having a Le(a-b+) phenotype and 32 having a Le(a-b-)-secretor phenotype possessed at least one Se1 or Se2.The frequencies of occurrence of Se1, Se2, and sej among 410 alleles examined in a random sample of 205 Japanese individuals were 15, 46, and 39%, respectively, indicating a rather wide distribution of the sej allele in the Japanese population. The results show that the Sec2 gene really encodes the secretor enzyme α(1,2)fucosyltransferase and indicate that a ethnic group-specific nonsense or missense point mutation in the Sec2 gene determines nonsecretor status. The phylogenic aspect and biological significance of the Se and Le genes are discussed. The Lewis histo-blood group system comprises two major antigens, Lewis a and Lewis b.

https://openalex.org/W2050745292,"The mouse phenobarbital (PB)-inducible Cyp2b10 gene promoter has been isolated and sequenced, and control of its expression has been characterized. The 1405-base pair (bp) Cyp2b10 promoter sequence is 83% identical to the corresponding region from the rat CYP2B2 gene. In addition to the lack of CA repeats, differences include insertion of 42 base pairs (−123/-82 bp) into the middle of a consensus sequence to the so-called “Barbie box.” In this report, we have developed a primary mouse hepatocyte culture system in which endogenous 2B10 mRNA as well as Cyp2b10-driven CAT activity were induced by PB and 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP), but not by the 3-chloro derivative of TCPOBOP. Deletion analysis of the Cyp2b10 promoter identified a basal transcription element at −64/-34 bp and a negative element at −971/-775 bp. Sequences contained within the −1404/-971 bp region are responsible for the induced CAT activity. DNase I protection and gel shift assays detected five major protein binding sites within the −1404/-971 bp fragment, one of which shared high sequence identity with a portion of a regulatory element in CYP2B2 gene (Trottier, E., Belzil, A., Stoltz, C., and Anderson, A.(1995) Gene 158, 263-268).

Our results indicate that sequences important for PB-induced transcription of Cyp2b10 gene are located in the distal promoter. Many P450 genes are induced by exogenous chemicals including drugs, environmental toxins, and carcinogens. Elevated P450 expression underlies many drug activation events and drug interactions that may lead to their increased toxicity and carcinogenicity (Conney, 1967; Gonzalez, 1989). Phenobarbital (PB) 1The abbreviations used are: PBphenobarbitalAGPα1-acid glycoproteinkbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCYPcytochrome P450EGFepidermal growth factorGHgrowth hormonePBREPB-responsive elementPBSphosphate-buffered salineTCPOBOP1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxyl)] benzeneRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. is a prototype for a group of structurally unrelated chemicals that still share the property of activating many members of CYP subfamilies 2B, 2C, and 3A in animal species (for reviews, see Nebert and Gonzalez (1987), Gonzalez(1989), Porter and Coon(1991), Waxman and Azaroff (1992), and Denison and Whitlock(1995)). The molecular details of this regulation in mammalian cells are largely unknown, owing to the lack of PB-responsive cell lines or other reliable in vitro assay systems. phenobarbital α1-acid glycoprotein kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cytochrome P450 epidermal growth factor growth hormone PB-responsive element phosphate-buffered saline 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxyl)] benzene reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. An extensive study of the barbiturate-regulated induction mechanism of bacterial CYP102 gene led Fulco and associates to identify a 17-bp sequence as the binding site for a barbiturate-regulated factor (He and Fulco, 1991; Liang and Fulco, 1995). Based on sequence comparisons and in vitro protein binding studies (He and Fulco, 1991), it was suggested that a similar sequence located in the CYP2B promoter (−89/-73 bp) could be the PB-responsive element for this and other mammalian P450 genes (Shaw and Fulco, 1993; Liang et al., 1995). Some studies indicated that this so-called Barbie box (consensus: 5′-ATCAAAAGCTGGAGG) may play a role in PB-induction of mammalian genes. The element required for in vitro transcription of a CYP2B2 minigene (−88/-56 bp) includes the Barbie box (Rangarajan and Padmanaban, 1989; Upadhya et al., 1992). The deletion or mutation of a Barbie box-like sequence (−140/-124 bp) in rat α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) promoter suppressed both basal and dexamethasone- or PB-induced CAT expression (Fournier et al., 1994). Other studies argue against a PB-inducible role for the Barbie box. A transgenic mouse line carrying up to −800 bp of CYP2B2 5′-flanking sequence expressed CYP2B2 mRNA only constitutively. PB-dependent induction of 2B2 mRNA was evident when additional 5′ sequences were present (Ramsden et al., 1993). Furthermore, in rat Qsj:SD strain CYP2B2 induction is defective even though CYP2B1 is activated by PB. Basal expression from both genes can be detected, and both CYP2B2 and CYP2B1 promoter sequences up to −800 bp matched those of the parent strain, containing intact Barbie box sequences (Hashimoto et al., 1988). As for AGP gene, the kinetics of PB induction are much slower than for CYP2B (Fournier et al., 1994), other studies do not demonstrate any protein binding to Barbie box-like sequences in rat or mouse AGP promoter (Ratajczak et al., 1992; Lee et al., 1993), and basal and dexamethasone-dependent expression are governed by another elements at −155/143 and −120/-105 bp (Ingrassia et al., 1994). These conflicting data indicate that the role of Barbie box in CYP2B regulation is not yet resolved. The transcription of hepatic P450 genes is rapidly activated by PB in vivo. While many hepatoma cell lines have lost their ability to express P450s or respond to PB, in some primary cultures CYP2B mRNAs can be increased (Schuetz et al., 1990; Waxman et al., 1990; Akrawi et al., 1993; Aubrecht et al., 1993; Sidhu et al., 1993). However, there is a paucity of data on CYP2B transcriptional regulation or reporter gene assays in primary cells. Clearly, the development of a faithful PB-inducible system would foster a better understanding of induction processes involved. In the present report, we have now developed a PB-responsive primary hepatocyte culture method suitable for reporter gene assays and mRNA analyses. We have cloned and characterized the promoter element from the mouse Cyp2b10 gene, the major PB-inducible P450 (Honkakoski and Lang, 1989; Aida and Negishi, 1991; Honkakoski et al., 1992a, 1992b). Our results suggest that Barbie box-like sequences do not have a major transcriptional role, and that sequences important for PB-induced transcription are located in the distal part of Cyp2b10 gene. Restriction enzymes were from Life Technologies, Inc. or New England Biolabs. Random priming kit was from Pharmacia Biotechn Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol), [α-35S]dATP (>1000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dATP (>6000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), and [14C]dichloroacetylchloramphenicol (56 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Corp. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems DNA/RNA synthesizer. Cell culture media, media supplements, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc., collagenase type I and collagen I were from Sigma, and Matrigel and tissue culture dishes were obtained from Becton Dickinson Labware (Bedford, MA). All other chemicals were usually from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. TCPOBOP and 1,4-bis[2-(3-chloropyridyloxy)]benzene were synthesized by a modification of the method of Kende et al.(1985), and structures were verified using MS and 1H NMR. The purities exceeded 99% as judged by 1H NMR. Male, 8-10-week-old DBA/2J or C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were either untreated or induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of PB (100 mg/kg, in saline) or TCPOBOP (3 mg/kg, in corn oil) (Honkakoski et al., 1992a). Tissue samples were taken 16 h later, pooled, and processed for total RNA (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987) and preparations of liver nuclei (Legraverend et al., 1992) or nuclear extracts (Gorski et al., 1986). The vehicles themselves had no effect on CYP2B10 expression (Honkakoski et al., 1992a, 1992b). Standard molecular biology protocols were followed (Maniatis et al., 1989). DBA/2J genomic DNA was partially digested with MboI and ligated into the BamHI site of EMBL3 vector. Approximately 106 phages were screened initially with 2B10 cDNA (pf3/46) and subsequently with a EcoRI-StuI cDNA fragment (+1/+158 bp) (Noshiro et al., 1988). Twenty-two independent clones were isolated, and phage DNAs were further analyzed by restriction mapping and hybridization with a CYP2B10 mRNA-specific oligonucleotide (primer C, see below), subcloning into pUC vectors, and dideoxy sequencing using universal and specific primers. Only one clone, designated L4, was identified corresponding to the Cyp2b10 gene. Some fragments of the L4 phage DNA (Hind/Bam-4, −1.4/+2.3 kb; Bgl/Pst-4, −4.3/-0.6 kb, Hind/Pst-4, −1.4/-0.6 kb) were further subcloned into pUC and M13mp18 vectors and sequenced. We isolated total liver RNA from PB-induced male DBA/2J mice to minimize the expression of related, female-specific CYP2B9 mRNA (Noshiro et al., 1988) and used sequence information and conserved exon-intron junctions of Cyp2b genes (Lakso et al., 1991) for designing specific primers for 2B10. Ten micrograms of RNA was reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim). The cDNA was amplified for 20 cycles using primers A (5′-CGTGAATTCCTTGAAGGTTGGCTCAACGACAG, +314/+341 nucleotide of pf3/46 cDNA) and B (5′-CGTGAATTCAACATTGGTTAGACCAGGACCATGG, 5′ end of CYP2B10 mRNA, deduced from primer extension) and Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The amplified DNA was digested with EcoRI and ligated into the EcoRI site of M13mp18. Single-stranded phage DNA from 10 independent colonies was isolated and sequenced using M13 primers. Each sequence matched the deduced first exon sequence of the genomic DNA, confirming that we had isolated the Cyp2b10 gene. One hundred micrograms of total liver RNA from untreated and PB-induced male DBA/2J mice were reverse-transcribed at 42°C for 1 h using 32P-end-labeled primer C (5′-GAAGTTGCCACGGGACTTTGGG; +78/+99 nucleotides of pf3/46 cDNA). The residual RNA was destroyed by RNase A; resulting cDNAs, and G and G+A Maxam-Gilbert reactions of the amplified genomic fragment (primers C and D (5′-CAGCACACCCGCAGTCTCTTGT; nucleotides −306/-285) were electrophoresed on 8% acrylamide, 6 M urea gels and autoradiographed. Nuclear run-on assays were carried out essentially according to Legraverend et al. (1992) using identical amounts of nuclei (corresponding to 400 μg of DNA) from untreated, PB- or TCPOBOP-induced male mouse livers and 0.1 mCi of [α-32P]UTP. After incubation at 30°C for 20 min, 32P-labeled RNA transcripts were isolated and hybridized (20 × 106 cpm) to nitrocellulose-immobilized linear cDNAs (5 μg) for p16α-14 recognizing both CYP2D9 and CYP2D10 mRNAs (Wong et al., 1989), pf3/46 recognizing CYP2B10 mRNA, γ-actin, and pUC19 vector (Aida and Negishi, 1991). The washed (3 × 20 min at 68°C, 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) filters were then autoradiographed. To avoid problems with cross-hybridization with the cDNA probe due to large number of Cyp2b genes and low levels of CYP2B10 mRNA in extrahepatic tissues, we chose RT-PCR method instead of Northern blotting. The cDNAs were synthesized as above using 50 μg of total tissue RNA from control and induced male mice. CYP2B10 cDNA was amplified using Taq DNA polymerase and primers A and B (20 cycles for liver, 30 cycles for other tissues). The products were electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel and photographed. Control experiments proved that RT-PCR was done under conditions where the product yield was proportional to the cycle number and linearly dependent on the amount of reverse-transcribed RNA. Southern blotting and probing with EcoRI-StuI cDNA fragment and sequencing of the 360-bp product were also done to verify the CYP2B10 message. Nuclear extracts from untreated and induced mouse livers were further purified by heparin-agarose (Sigma) as described by Yoshioka et al. (1990). The eluted proteins were dialyzed against 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin, and concentrated to 4-7 mg/ml protein. DNase I protection assays were carried out according to instructions in the SureTrack kit (Pharmacia) using 32P-end-labeled, appropriately cut fragments from Hind/Bam-4 or Hind/Pst-4 plasmid DNA or generated by amplification using a 32P-end-labeled primer. The DNA fragments were separated on standard sequencing gels, which were then dried and autoradiographed. Gel shift assays were performed using 1-5 μg of crude nuclear extract in 10-20 μl of 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 15% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM NaCl, and about 30,000 cpm of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide or DNA fragment probe. The free and protein-bound probes were separated on 4.5% or 7% acrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE buffer prior to autoradiography. Based on the detected transcription start sites, we chose HincII site (+4) as the 3′ end for the promoter construct. Other appropriate restriction enzymes were used to cut fragments out of Hind/Bam-4 pDNA. The fragments and SalI-digested pCAT-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) were treated with T4 or Klenow DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Following transformation into Escherichia coli HB101 cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), the recombinant plasmids were purified twice on CsCl gradients, verified by restriction mapping and sequencing over the junction sites, and checked for content of supercoiled plasmid on agarose gels. The plasmids were named according to distance of 5′-end of the insert from the transcription start site. −4300CAT was generated by ligation of 3.7-kb PstI-PstI fragment from Bgl/Pst-4 plasmid into PstI-digested −1404-CAT plasmid. Other constructs were made by amplification of specific regions of −1404-CAT using primers into which HindIII (5′) or PstI (3′) were incorporated. After digestion of DNAs with HindIII and PstI, the fragments were ligated into corresponding sites of −1404-CAT plasmid. The purified plasmids were verified by sequencing over the amplified region. Electroporation was chosen because DNA transfection takes place prior to plating, and equal cell aliquots from same pool are taken for treatments, eliminating differences in transfection efficiencies (see LeCam et al.(1994), and references therein). It is also advantageous to be able to perform transfection and start treatments quickly, limiting the transcription taking place during transfection. Our preliminary experiments with β-galactosidase and pCAT-Control plasmids (Promega) proved that with the same cell preparation, transfection efficiencies were similar regardless of DNA construct, even though daily variations were observed. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male C57BL/6 mice using a two-step collagenase perfusion (0.4-0.5 mg/ml in HBSS supplemented with 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1 μM porcine insulin; Sigma) and low speed centrifugations. They were further purified by Percoll (Pharmacia) density centrifugation to a viability of at least 90% (Nemoto and Sakurai, 1995). The cells were washed and suspended (20-30 × 106/ml) in ice-cold PBS containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4. The cells were electroporated at 960 microfarads and 150-170 V using 300 μg/ml sonicated herring sperm DNA as carrier and up to 100 μg/ml CAT construct. The electroporated cells were diluted into prewarmed Williams' E medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum, ITS supplement (Sigma), and streptomycin-penicillin G (100 units/ml) and incubated for 5 min. From each pool, 3-ml aliquots were dispensed on 60-mm cell culture dishes, and the cells were allowed to attach for 30 min at 37°C under 5% CO2. The unattached cells were removed, and the dishes were washed with PBS. The cells (2-3 × 106/dish) then received fresh medium without serum, containing 5 nM dexamethasone, and inducers or vehicles (1 mM PB in saline; 50 nM TCPOBOP or 1,4-bis[2-(3-chloropyridyloxy)]benzene in dimethyl sulfoxide). In some instances, cycloheximide (10 μM), α-amanitin (1 μM), actinomycin D (0.5 μM), GH (50 ng/ml), or EGF (20 ng/ml) were added 30 min prior to the inducer. The transfection and CAT assay conditions were optimized in preliminary experiments using pCAT-Control plasmid. Culture conditions, treatment times, and doses were defined by analyzing CYP2B10 mRNA and protein, and CAT expression from the −1404-CAT and −64-CAT plasmids. Alternatively, cells were plated without electroporation, allowed to attached, and washed with PBS. Cells were transfected using 7.5 μg of DNA and 50 μg of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 3 ml of medium (Shih and Towle, 1995) without dexamethasone or serum. After an overnight incubation, the medium was changed to additionally contain 5 nM dexamethasone and 0.5 mg/ml Matrigel, and inducers were added for 24 h. The cell medium was removed at 8 h, and cells were lysed using Trireagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The CYP2B10 mRNA was analyzed using the methods described above, and mouse albumin 180-bp cDNA fragment was amplified using primers E (5′-AGACATCCTTATTTCTATGCCC) and F (5′-CTGCATACTGGAGCACTTCATT). The cellular mRNA-derived PCR products were cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The verified cDNA fragments were used as probes in Northern blotting of cellular RNA (Maniatis et al., 1989). For CAT assay, 22 h after medium change, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM EDTA, scraped off, and pelleted. The cell pellets were lysed as described by Pothier et al.(1992) and assayed for protein (Bradford, 1976) and CYP2B10 protein (Honkakoski et al., 1992b). Equal amounts of cell extracts (150-200 μg of protein) were then heat-treated and assayed for CAT activity (Gorman et al., 1982) with the exceptions that acetyl coenzyme A concentration was 1.33 mM and incubation time was extended to 4 h. We isolated a genomic clone containing at least 13 kb of 5′-flanking region, the first exon, and part of the first intron of the Cyp2b10 gene. The other 21 genomic clones did not contain any portions of the Cyp2b10 gene, and they could be classified into seven groups, confirming the large size of Cyp2b gene family (Lakso et al., 1991). The first exon 197-bp sequence (Fig. 1) was 94%, 82%, and 79% similar to that of rat PB-inducible CYP2B2, and those of non-inducible mouse Cyp2b9 and rat CYP2B3 (Jean et al., 1994), respectively. In 5′-flanking sequences, the overall homology of Cyp2b10 to CYP2B2 was 83%. The Cyp2b10 promoter was 62% and 70% similar to that of CYP2B3 and Cyp2b9 respectively, within the proximal 400 bp; upstream of the (CA) repeat, the similarity to Cyp2b9 dropped to only 36%. Only a few differences from the CYP2B2 gene were noted; first, the (CA) repeats (Suwa et al., 1985; Lakso et al., 1991) were very short in Cyp2b10 (Fig. 1; −303/-300 bp). Second, the so-called Barbie box sequence (Shaw and Fulco, 1993) was interrupted in Cyp2b10 by an insertion of 42 nucleotides, the result being that sequence homology to the Barbie box consensus decreased to 67% (Fig. 1, wavy lines). However, the insertion was shared by mouse Cyp2b9 and rat CYP2B3 genes (Jean et al., 1994), suggestive of loss of the 42-bp DNA element from CYP2B1/2 genes after the rat-mouse divergence. An atypical TATA box (CATAAAAG) and sequences resembling the binding sites for transcription factors including Sp1, AP-1, C/EBP, Ets-1, HNF-5, and GR were also found (Fig. 1). We determined the transcription start sites of Cyp2b10 gene by primer extension analysis. Male mice were used to minimize the expression of CYP2B9 mRNA and its possible cross-hybridization with the primer. Three bands represent the start sites at adenines at 29, 30, and 34 bp downstream of the putative TATA box, respectively (Fig. 2). Treatment by PB did not change the location of this site, since the same fainter bands were detected in control RNA. The observed start sites matched closely to those of CYP2B1/2 in rat liver (Suwa et al., 1985). Previous Northern blot analysis showed that hepatic CYP2B10 mRNA was highly induced within 3 h after PB or TCPOBOP injection (Aida and Negishi, 1991; Honkakoski et al., 1992a). To minimize detection and cross-hybridization problems, CYP2B10 mRNA expression was measured by RT-PCR. Although CYP2B10 mRNA was detected in lung and intestine after longer amplification, PB-inducible expression was observed only in the liver (Fig. 3). Sequencing of the amplified product yielded only CYP2B10 mRNA in liver (not shown). The nuclear run-on assays showed that both PB and TCPOBOP induced nascent 32P-labeled CYP2B10 transcripts (detected by pf3/46 cDNA), while that of non-inducible CYP2D9 plus 2D10 (p16α-14 cDNA) was relatively unchanged. Furthermore, this induced transcription was largely unaffected by the presence of GH, since the pattern was quite similar between intact and hypophysectomized mice (Fig. 4). This confirms that pituitary factors are not critical for Cyp2b10 expression in mice (Smith et al., 1993), as observed for CYP2B1/2 in rats (Yamazoe et al., 1987; Schuetz et al., 1990). The transcription of γ-actin was variable for unknown reasons. The amount of CYP2D9 plus 2D10 transcripts was decreased by hypophysectomy (Fig. 4), consistent with our previous reports (Wong et al., 1989; Yoshioka et al., 1990).Figure 4:Transcriptional regulation of the Cyp2b10 gene. Hypophysectomized (Hypox) and sham-operated (Sham) DBA/2J male mice were injected with corn oil (lanes 1), PB (lanes 2), or TCPOBOP (lanes 3). Purified nuclei (400 μg of DNA) were incubated with [α-32P]UTP for 20 min, and the isolated RNA transcripts (20 × 106 cpm) were hybridized to indicated immobilized linear plasmid DNAs (5 μg) detecting CYP2B10 (pf3/46), CYP2D9 plus CYP2D10 (p16α-14), γ-actin mRNAs, or pUC according to Legraverend et al.(1992). The filters were washed (3 × 20 min) at 68°C with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and autoradiographed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then developed a primary cell culture system, in which endogenous CYP2B10 mRNA could be rapidly induced. Northern hybridization (Fig. 5A) and RT-PCR assays (Fig. 5B) displayed more than 10-fold increases of CYP2B10 mRNA in hepatocytes within 8 h by treatment with PB, 100 nM dexamethasone, or TCPOBOP, but not by 3-chloro derivative of TCPOBOP. Time course studies indicated CYP2B10 mRNA was elevated already after 1 h, reaching a maximum level at 8 h, as in vivo (data not shown). Most importantly, the increase in CYP2B10 mRNA was blocked by pretreatment with the transcriptional inhibitors α-amanitin and actinomycin D (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 7 and 8) but not by cycloheximide, GH, or EGF (lane 6 and data not shown). This indicates that Cyp2b10 gene transcription is rapidly activated also in primary hepatocytes. Intriguingly, Northern hybridization detected a non-inducible 2.7-kb mRNA, in addition to 2.2-kb CYP2B10 mRNA (Fig. 5A). Since CYP2B9 or CYP2B13 mRNAs could not be amplified from these cells (not shown), the 2.7-kb mRNA may be a novel member of the Cyp2b family or an alternatively spliced variant. Nevertheless, it served as an excellent internal control since both the 2.7-kb and 2.2-kb RNAs are newly transcribed and present in similar levels. The abundant albumin mRNA was used to control RNA loading and quality, and it was not changed by the treatments. We also found that low concentrations (<10 nM) of dexamethasone in the medium are essential for PB induction of CYP2B10 mRNA while higher levels (≥100 nM) increase the basal level. We transfected primary hepatocytes by electroporation with various CAT reporters containing successive 5′-deletions of the Cyp2b10 promoter. The promoters carrying 5′-flanking sequences up to −775 bp had high basal transcriptional activities, mostly contributed by sequences between −64 and −34 bp. Elimination of the Barbie box-like sequences had no effect (−376CAT versus −64CAT; Fig. 6A). Sequences upstream of −775 bp decreased the basal activity considerably, which suggested a negative regulatory element between −971 bp and −775 bp of Cyp2b10 gene (Fig. 6A). Inducible transcription was observed only with the two longest 5′-flanking sequences: PB or TCPOBOP treatments resulted in 2.0-3.3-fold increases of CAT activity with the −4300-CAT and −1404-CAT reporters, respectively (Fig. 6B, Table 1). This indicates that the −1404/-971 bp region may contain DNA elements important for PB induction, since further addition of 5′ sequences did not enhance induction of CAT. Importantly, 1,4-bis[2-(3-chloropyridyl-oxy)]benzene, which did not induce 2B10 mRNA (Fig. 5, A and B), also failed to induce CAT activity from the −1404CAT reporter (Fig. 6C), whereas PB and TCPOBOP increased both 2B10 mRNA and CAT activity. The lipofection protocol gave qualitatively similar results with 4-5-fold increase by TCPOBOP but somewhat higher basal CAT activity (Fig. 6D).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In the light of the reported importance of the Barbie box to PB induction and results of our functional studies, we performed DNase I protection with heparin-agarose-enriched nuclear extracts. In the proximal promoter, regions at −64/-45 and −235/-215 bp (Fig. 7A) appear to match the regions displaying PB-enhanced binding within the CYP2B2 gene (Shephard et al., 1994); however, no differences in protein binding was evident with Cyp2b10 gene as confirmed by gel shift assays (not shown). Intriguingly, the regions resembling the Barbie box (Fig. 1) were not protected in any of the samples (Fig. 7A). This finding was confirmed by gel shift assays; furthermore, addition of PB directly (He and Fulco, 1991) or together with cytosolic fractions to nuclear extracts in vitro did not produce any inducer-dependent complexes (not shown). This indicates that Barbie box-like sequences of Cyp2b10 do not bind nuclear proteins. In the −1404/971 bp region, we could not detect any reproducible differences in the protection pattern between the samples (Fig. 7, B and C), further confirmed in gel shift assays (not shown). The major distal protected segments included −1354/1330 bp, which apparently corresponds to the GRE-like element in CYP2B2 (Jaiswal et al., 1990), and −1228/-1195 bp containing C/EBP and AGGTCA motifs. The signaling mechanisms and DNA elements involved in PB-induced transcription of CYP2B genes have not been elucidated in detail. Hepatoma cell lines in general have lost either their ability to express CYP2B genes or their responsiveness to PB, reflecting the highly differentiated nature of the CYP expression. Intensive efforts, therefore, have been made to develop primary hepatocyte cultures responsive to PB (see, e.g., Schuetz et al.(1990), Waxman et al.(1990), Akrawi et al.(1993), Aubrecht et al.(1993), Sidhu et al.(1993), and Nemoto and Sakurai(1995)). In these systems, CYP2Bs mRNAs and proteins are highly inducible, and a great deal has been learned about inhibitory effects of serum, growth factors, cytokines, and cyclic AMP (Waxman et al., 1990; Schuetz et al., 1990; Aubrecht et al., 1993; Abdel-Razzak et al., 1995; Clark et al., 1995; Sidhu and Omiecinski, 1995), as well as the dexamethasone requirement for optimal CYP2B induction (Waxman et al., 1990; Kocarek et al., 1994; Nemoto et al., 1995). However, the presence of feeder cells or Matrigel underlay, or the formation of cell clusters, may compromise DNA transfection into the cells (Pasco and Fagan, 1989). Similarly, Matrigel overlay limits the transfection period to the first 4 h of culture, whereas PB treatment is initiated usually 48 h later (Schuetz et al., 1990; Sidhu et al., 1993). This may result in destabilization of transfected DNA, in loss of transcription factors, and in uncontrolled transcription from the plasmid prior to treatment. In some instances, induction kinetics seem to differ from the rapid response in vivo. Given the long PB treatment (24-96 h), some co-treatments may also affect CYP2B mRNA stability as well. With these concerns in mind, we have now developed a primary hepatocyte culture in which endogenous Cyp2b10 gene is maximally activated within 8 h. This activation was blocked by pretreatment by transcriptional inhibitors but not by cycloheximide or growth factors, and the activation kinetics mirrors the in vivo responses (Aida and Negishi, 1991; Honkakoski et al., 1992a). Similar protocols were developed by Salonpääet al. (1994) and Lecam et al.(1994) for CYP2A5 and GH-regulated rat Spi 2.1 gene, respectively. Protocol differences include shorter cell attachment time with serum, decreased dexamethasone levels, and plating to higher density, all of which were found necessary for optimal CYP2B10 mRNA expression. We then sought after DNA transfection methods compatible with our cell system. We used electroporation to avoid differences in transfection efficiency by using the same pool of transfected cells for aliquoting for different treatments (Paquereau and LeCam, 1992; LeCam et al., 1994). Our observations with various Cyp2b10 deletion constructs correlate well with the data from CYP2B2 transgenic mice. In both cases, promoters containing about 800 bp of 5′-flanking sequence had high basal expression but showed no PB-inducibility in hepatocytes. Similarly, additional 5′-flanking sequences decreased the basal activity but conferred PB-inducible transcription (Ramsden et al., 1993). We found that the −1404/-971 bp region was critical for Cyp2b10 inducibility. The importance of this element was strengthened by our finding that another Cyp2b10 inducer TCPOBOP (but not its inactive 3-chloro derivative) also increased CAT activity from −1404CAT reporter. Two other studies have also indicated that a PB-responsive element (PBRE) might be located in distal parts of PB-inducible genes. Hahn et al.(1991) identified a PBRE between −5.9 and −1.1 kilobase pairs of the chicken CYP2H1 gene that exhibited 2.4-fold increases. Trottier et al.(1995) located a PBRE of CYP2B2 gene within −2318 and −2155 bp, showing 3.5- to 6.6-fold. The 163-bp CYP2B2 and 4800-bp CYP2H1 fragments could also confer PB inducibility to heterologous promoters. Despite our attempts to link −1404/-971 bp element and several overlapping fragments to heterologous and proximal Cyp2b10 promoters, we could not confer any PB inducibility to these constructs (not shown). This may be due to disruption of interactions between the enhancer-binding factor(s) and factors binding elsewhere on the Cyp2b10 gene, such as the repressor element at −971/-775 bp. Apparently, these reporter genes are expressed differently, but so are the endogenous PB-inducible CYP genes between species. For instance, rat and mouse CYP2B forms differ in their response to dexamethasone, TCPOBOP, and GH (Meehan et al., 1988; Poland et al., 1981; Honkakoski et al., 1992a; Smith et al., 1993), and there are differences in tissue specificity, basal liver expression, and sensitivity to cycloheximide within PB-inducible CYP2B genes (Omiecinski, 1986; Ohmori et al., 1993; Dogra et al., 1993). It is therefore possible that some aspects of the induction process may differ between species, and activation of Cyp2b10 gene may include a unique step in addition to the principal mechanism common to PB-inducible P450 genes. The well established function of Barbie box in bacterial CYP102 gene transcription and its homology to other PB-inducible gene promoters (He and Fulco, 1991; Shaw and Fulco, 1993; Liang et al., 1995) has focused much attention on the role of Barbie box-like sequences in mammalian gene regulation (Upadhya et al., 1992; Fournier et al., 1994). Intriguingly, a 42-bp insertion into Cyp2b10 sequence not only splits the Barbie box, it also decreases its degree of sequence identity. We did not detect any nuclear protein binding to Cyp2b10 Barbie box-like sequences. They did not mediate PB-induction, nor did their deletion have any effect on basal promoter activity, and importantly, the presence of 42-bp insertion had no effect on the inducibility of the endogenous Cyp2b10 gene. These findings imply that Barbie box may not be a common regulatory element for PB-inducible expression. In support of this view, PB-responsive mouse −1404/-971 bp and rat −2318/-2155 bp fragments do not contain any Barbie box-like sequences. In distal −1404/-971 bp region, none of the protein binding sites displayed any major difference between control and PB treatment, a finding identical to rat 2B2 163-bp region (Trottier et al., 1995). There are several explanations for this apparent difference between binding and functional studies. First, a pre-existing factor might be modified by a signal derived from the inducer, e.g. by phosphorylation, a mechanism known to activate nuclear factors (Hunter and Karin, 1992). This would be quite consistent with the rapid PB induction and its insensitivity to cycloheximide. Other possibilities include that a factor is being displaced by a similar, but functionally different factor (Isshiki et al., 1991), or that the induction is mediated by protein-protein interactions (Konig et al., 1992) rather than by a mechanism involving primarily DNA-protein recognition. Even though it is unclear why a putative PBRE would be located in different regions of the homologous rat and mouse CYP2B genes, we found similarities between the rat 163-bp sequence and the mouse −1404/-971 bp region. A 25-bp DNA fragment at −1.2 kilobase pairs of Cyp2b10 gene is 80% similar to a portion of the 163-bp sequence, and an overlapping segment (−1228/-1195 bp) can bind nuclear protein(s). Both rat and mouse 25-bp fragments carry core binding sites (AGGTCA) for members of ligand-dependent transcription factor superfamily. This is very interesting in view of reports that some endocrine-sensitive factors, steroid hormones, and oxysterols might modulate basal and/or PB-induced CYP2B expression (Larsen and Jefcoate, 1995; Nemoto and Sakurai, 1995; Kocarek et al., 1993). It has been suggested that PB-like inducers may act on CYP2B genes indirectly by inhibition of endogenous sterol metabolism and interfering with the natural sterol signaling of CYP2B expression (Waxman and Azaroff, 1992). Our preliminary studies indicate that several nuclear factors are able to bind the 25-bp segment, and we are currently trying to purify and characterize these factors.

https://openalex.org/W2014201393,"The role for the two tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors in discriminating TNF and lymphotoxin α (LTα) effects has been studied. TNF and LTα were equally mitogenic in Fs4 fibroblasts, which express a high amount of the p55 compared to the p75 TNF receptors (TNFRs). In contrast, TNF was more potent than LTα in mediating gene regulation and cytotoxicity in SW480-βGal cells and KYM-1 cells, which have a high p75/p55 TNFR ratio. Both TNF and LTα showed comparable affinities for the two TNFRs. However, in contrast to LTα, TNF dissociated rapidly from the p75 TNFR, whereas both cytokines dissociated slowly from the p55 TNFR. Soluble p55 TNFR was much more potent than soluble p75 TNFR in inhibiting TNF cytotoxicity, whereas both soluble receptors moderately decreased LTα-mediated cytotoxicity with comparable efficacy. Antagonistic monoclonal antibodies against either TNFR types markedly inhibited TNF effects. However, only the p55 TNFR antagonistic antibody significantly decreased LTα-mediated cytotoxicity and cytomegalovirus promoter activation, whereas blocking of the p75 TNFR enhanced the LTα effects.

The ratio of the two receptors on the cell surface varies among cells, i.e. some cell types have a high proportion of the p75 TNFR versus the p55 TNFR, and vice versa. Furthermore, the cell surface expression of the two TNFRs is independently regulated in many cell types. It has been shown, for instance, that activation of B cells results in a marked up-regulation of the p75 but not the p55 TNFR(14.Erikstein B.K. Smeland E.B. Kiil Blomhoff H. Funderud S. Prydz K. Lesslauer W. Espevik T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Also, the generation of soluble receptors differs for the two TNFRs, because in vitro stimulation of monocytes with lipopolysacharide results in the specific secretion of the p75 TNFR, whereas administration of endotoxin to humans leads to increased serum levels of both types of soluble receptors(15.Lien E.

Invest. 1992; 90: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Both receptors can also be found in soluble forms in body fluids during various pathological and physiological conditions(17.Van Zee K.J. Kohno T. Fisher E. Rock C.S. Moldawer L.L. Lowry S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of soluble TNFRs in vivo is yet to be elucidated since they have been reported to either attenuate or enhance TNF activity in vitro(18.Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

Despite strong redundancy, TNF and LTα have been reported to differ in their potency to exert biological effects in many cell types. Thus, TNF was more potent than LTα in inducing cytotoxicity toward MCF7 carcinoma cells and cytokine secretion by human fibroblasts, monocytes, and endothelial cells(20.Kircheis R. Milleck J. Korobko V.G. Shingarova L.N. Schmidt H.E. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1992; 3: 381-390Google Scholar, 21.Locksley R.M. Heinzel F.P. Shepard H.M. Agosti J. Esselau T.E. Aggarwal B.B. Harlan J.M. J.

However, TNF and LTα were equally cytotoxic toward mouse WEHI clone 13 and L929 fibroblastic cell lines (24.Espevik T. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 25.Selmaj K. Raine C.S. Farooq M. Norton W.T. Brosnan C.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1522-1529PubMed Google Scholar). LTα, on the other hand, was more potent than TNF when assayed for the ability to induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis in oligodendrocyte cultures(25.Selmaj K. Raine C.S. Farooq M. Norton W.T. Brosnan C.F. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1522-1529PubMed Google Scholar). Furthemore, LTα, but not TNF, has been reported to act as a growth factor for Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cell lines(26.Estrov Z. Kurzrock R. Pocisk E. Pathak S. Kantarjian H.M. Zipf T.F. Harris D. Talpas M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 177: 763-774Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is, however, not entirely clear to what extent these cytokines have differential physiological effects(27.Porter A.G. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 64: 193-200Google Scholar). The specific roles of the two TNFRs in mediating the TNF and LTα signals are currently vividly debated(28.Tartaglia L.A. Rothe M. Hu Y.-F. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 73: 126-213Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 29.Heller R.A. Song K. Fan N. Chang D.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In many cell types, studies with antagonistic antibodies have indicated that both receptors are important in mediating TNF effects(30.Shalaby M.R. Sundan A. Loetscher H. Brockhaus M. Lesslauer W. Espevik T. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1517-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a unique “passing model” has been suggested to explain the role of the p75 TNFR in mediating TNF responses(31.Tartaglia L.A. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18542-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basis for this model is that although TNF binds to the p75 TNFR with somewhat higher affinity than to the p55 TNFR, the rate of dissociation of TNF from the p75 TNFR is higher than from the p55 TNFR. This rapid rate of dissociation of the TNF•p75 TNFR complex may facilitate interaction of TNF with the p55 TNFR, suggesting a role of the p75 TNFR in passing TNF to the p55 TNFR, which has been postulated to be the main TNF signal transducer. On the other hand, also the p75 TNFR mediates several TNF effects such as proliferation of T- and B-cells(14.Erikstein B.K. Smeland E.B. Kiil Blomhoff H. Funderud S. Prydz K. Lesslauer W. Espevik T.

At present, the distinct functional roles of the two TNFRs, as well as their possible role in defining disparate TNF and LTα effects, are not clear. Here we show that cells expressing a high proportion of the p75 TNFR are relatively resistant to the action of LTα and that LTα, in contrast to TNF, has a slow rate of dissociation from the p75 TNFR. Blocking of the p75 TNFR with antagonistic antibodies inhibited TNF effects but enhanced LTα activities in cells expressing a high p75/p55 TNFR ratio. It suggests a mechanism by which the high p75 TNFR expression may inhibit LTα effects and indicates distinct specific roles for the two receptor types in discriminating between TNF and LTα effects on cells. Human recombinant TNF-α and TNF-β (LTα) were generously supplied by Genentech Inc. (South San Fransisco, CA) and had a specific activity of 7.6 × 107 units/mg and 10 × 107 units/mg, respectively, in the LM bioassay. Recombinant soluble TNF receptors were generously provided by Dr. Refaat Shalaby (Genentech Inc.) and were produced by transfecting insect cells with baculoviruses which contained genes encoding extracellular regions of the p55 and p75 TNFRs, respectively. The monoclonal antibodies utr-1, which inhibits binding of TNF to the p75 TNFR, as well as htr-5 and htr-9, which inhibit binding of TNF to the p55 TNFR, have been described before(36.Espevik T. Brockhaus M. Loetscher H. Nonstad U. Shalaby R. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1517-1520Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 37.Hohmann H.P. Remy R. Brockhaus M. van Loon A.P.G.M. J. Biol.

TNF and LTα were iodinated by the IODOGEN method (39.Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) by incubating 10 μg of cytokine with 2 μg of solid 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3α,6α-diphenylglycoluril (Pierce) and 1 mCi of carrier-free Na125I (DuPont NEN, Bad Homburg, Germany; specific activity ~17 Ci/mg) for 15 min on ice. Labeled cytokine was separated from unincorporated iodine by chromatography over Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The specific activity of both cytokines was 60-80 μCi/mmol in various preparations. Labeled cytokines were stored at −80°C in the presence of carrier protein (BSA) until use. Both TNF and LTα retained full biological activity after iodination when assayed in the WEHI clone 13 biological assay(24.Espevik T. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that iodinated LTα appeared to lose its bioactivity more rapidly than iodinated TNF. Thus, the bioactivity of labeled cytokines were assayed in the WEHI clone 13 bioassay both before and after the experiments depicted here. The cell lines applied were the Fs4 human fibroblastic cell line (obtained from Dr. J Vilcek, The NYU Medical Center, New York), the human KYM-1 rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (kindly provided by Dr. A. Meager, The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, South Mimms, UK), and the human adenocarcinoma cell line SW480-βGal(33.Lægreid A. Medvedev A. Nonstad U. Bombara M.P. Ranges G. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line was prepared by transfecting the SW480 cells with pcDNAIneo (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) containing a promoterless β-galactosidase gene under the control of the CMV promoter. The cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc. Laboratories, Paisley, Scotland), supplemented with 2 mML-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), and 40 μg/ml garamycin (culture medium, CM). For measurements of specific binding of cytokines to cells, confluent cells were incubated in 24-well tissue culture plates with the indicated amounts of iodinated cytokine in the absence or presence of 0.5 nM unlabeled cytokine or antibodies as indicated in PBS, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.02% NaN3 for 3 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS/BSA/NaN3, solubilized in 0.5 ml/well 0.2 N KOH and counted in a Gamma spectrometer (Packard, Meriden, IL). Cell-associated radioactivity in the presence of excess unlabeled cytokine was defined as nonspecific binding and was subtracted from the values obtained without cold cytokine present to obtain the specific binding. The nonspecific binding was generally less than 10% of the specific binding. In experiments to measure the rate of dissociation, cells as above were incubated with saturating concentrations of iodinated cytokines, both in the presence and absence of utr-1 and htr-9, as above. The medium was then removed and PBS/BSA/NaN3 containing 0.5 nM unlabeled cytokine was added. The cells were then incubated at room temperature for the indicated time periods, washed three times, and cell-associated radioactivity was assayed as described above. Shown are typical experiments out of at least three in each case. Thymidine incorporation in Fs4 cells was measured as described (30.Shalaby M.R. Sundan A. Loetscher H. Brockhaus M. Lesslauer W. Espevik T. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1517-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating 104 cells/well with cytokines or antibodies in 200 μl of CM as indicated in triplicate wells of 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) for 72 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. 1 μCi/well [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham International, Slough, UK) was added after 68 h, and the cells were harvested after 4 h with a Micromate 196 Cell Harvester (Packard). Incorporated thymidine was measured by counting the samples for 2 min in a Matrix 96 Direct Beta Counter (Packard). The cytotoxic response of WEHI clone 13 and KYM-1 cells was estimated as described earlier (24.Espevik T. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 35.Medvedev A.E. Sundan A. Espevik T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2842-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with small modifications. Briefly, KYM-1 cells (3 × 104 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates in 100 μl of CM and incubated overnight. The medium was replenished, and the cells were incubated with cytokines and antibodies as indicated in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) for 24 h at 37°C. Cell viability was then assayed by staining the cells with 0.5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) for 4 h followed by dye extraction with isopropyl alcohol/HCl and measuring the absorbance of soluble dye at 570 nm. Cell viability was calculated according to the formula: cell viability (%) = (B/A) × 100, where A and B represent the A570 in control and cytokine-treated cells, respectively. The activation of CMV promoter in the SW480-βGal cells was measured as described earlier(33.Lægreid A. Medvedev A. Nonstad U. Bombara M.P. Ranges G. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown for 3 days at 37°C in microtiter wells (2 × 104 cells per well) of 96-well flat-bottomed plates. Then, cytokines and antibodies were added as indicated, and incubation was continued for 5 h at 37°C. Cells were washed in PBS, and 100 μl of 1.5 M clorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) were added. Following incubation for 20 min at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μl of 50 mM sodium carbonate (Sigma), and β-galactosidase activity was determined by measuring absorbance at 570 nM in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories). 1 × 106 cells per well were grown in 6-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) for 3 days at 37°C. Medium was replenished, and cells were stimulated with serial dilutions of TNF and LTα for 60 min (dose-response experiments) or with 10 ng/ml TNF and 100 ng/ml LTα (kinetic experiments). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described(33.Lægreid A. Medvedev A. Nonstad U. Bombara M.P. Ranges G. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed by incubating 1 μg of nuclear extract with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) in a binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 2% Ficoll) in a total volume of 20 μl for 10 min at room temperature. End-labeled NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide probe (5′ - AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′ (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, 1 × 104 to 5 × 104 cpm) was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 10 min. The samples were separated on native 7% polyacrylamide gels (0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA; 100 V/h followed by 130 V/2-3 h). The gels were dried (80°C, 2 h) and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Eastman Kodak). It is well known that in some cell lines TNF and LTα are equally potent in mediating a biological effect. Thus, TNF and LTα exhibited equal cytotoxic effect when added to WEHI clone 13 cells ((24.Espevik T. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar) and data not shown). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1A, TNF and LTα were equally potent in inducing proliferation of the Fs4 human fibroblastic cell line. In contrast to this, LTα was less potent than TNF in other cell lines. Thus, as shown in Fig. 1B, about 10-50-fold higher concentrations of LTα compared to TNF were needed to obtain a similar cytotoxicity toward the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line KYM-1, when applying the same preparations of the cytokines as used in Fig. 1A. Furthermore, when assaying for activation of a CMV reporter construct in the human adenocarcinoma cell line SW480-βGal, 500-1000-fold higher concentrations of LTα were required to obtain an effect similar to that induced by TNF. Moreover, in SW480-βGal cells, the maximal response obtained with LTα was lower compared to TNF, and the dose of LTα, inducing the half-maximal response, was about 1000-fold higher than that for TNF (Fig. 1C). The same difference between TNF and LTα was seen when directly assaying activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in SW480-βGal cells, whereas the time required for the half-maximal response was indistinguishable between TNF and LTα (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Mobilization of NF-κB in SW480-βGal cells by TNF and LTα. Gel-shift assays were performed on nuclear extracts from SW480-βGal cells treated with the indicated concentrations of TNF or LTα for 1 h at 37°C (left-hand side) or with 10 ng/ml TNF and 100 ng/ml LTα for the indicated time periods in minutes (right-hand side). wt-κB and m-κB represent lanes where the nuclear extracts and the specific probe were incubated with excess amounts of unlabeled wild type NF-κB and mutated NF-κB probes, respectively, as described earlier(20.Kircheis R. Milleck J. Korobko V.G. Shingarova L.N. Schmidt H.E. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1992; 3: 381-390Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these results indicate that although TNF and LTα are about equally potent in inducing responses in some cell lines, other cells are more or less resistant to the action of LTα while still being susceptible to the action of TNF. In order to understand the large relative differences in the sensitivity of the cell lines to TNF and LTα described above, we speculated that this could correlate with possible differences in binding of the two cytokines to these cell lines. The total number of receptors as well as the binding to each receptor were estimated by performing binding experiments in the presence and in the absence of antibodies which specifically block the binding of TNF and LTα to one but not the other receptor. As shown in Fig. 3, both TNF and LTα bound specificially and in a saturable manner to these cell lines. When the binding experiments were performed in the presence of the p75 TNFR blocking antibody, utr-1, the binding of both TNF and LTα was reduced by 10-20% in Fs4 cells, by 80-90% in KYM-1 cells, and by more than 95% in SW480-βGal cells. The p55 TNFR antibody htr-9 inhibited the binding of both TNF and LTα to Fs4, KYM-1, and SW480-βGal cells by 90%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. These data demonstrate that the binding sites recognized by both TNF and LTα are mainly of the p55 type in Fs4 cells, whereas in KYM-1 and SW480-βGal cells, 90% and 95%, respectively, of the binding sites are of the p75 type. Scatchard analysis of the data indicated that all three cell lines used here express approximately similar numbers of the p55 TNFR per cell (1000-3000 receptors/cell). On the other hand, these cell lines express in the range from a few hundreds (Fs4) to more than one hundred thousands (SW480-βGal) of the p75 TNFR per cell (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that a high specific activity of LTα correlates with a high p55/p75 TNFR ratio, whereas the specific activity of TNF is not particularly affected by the p55/p75 ratio. It should also be noted that in all three cell lines examined, the sum of the binding of both TNF and LTα in the presence of utr-1 and htr-9 equals the specific binding in the absence of antibodies. Thus, there is no indication of the existence of a third type of binding sites for either TNF, or LTα, which could explain the differences in their biological activity. It has been shown previously that TNF binds to the p75 TNFR with a dissociation constant of 0.3-0.5 nM, whereas the dissociation constant for TNF binding to the p55 TNFR has been reported to be 3-5 times higher (0.7-1.5 nM)(31.Tartaglia L.A. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18542-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Hohmann H.P. Brockhaus M. Bauerle P. Remy R. Kolbeck R. van Loon A.P.G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22409-22417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show Scatchard analysis of the binding of LTα toward the Fs4 and KYM-1 cells, both in the absence and in the presence of the antibodies utr-1 and htr-9 (Fig. 4, A and B). These data demonstrate that LTα binds also to the two TNFRs in a way comparable with TNF. Thus, for LTα, we estimated Kd values of 0.3 nM and 0.6 nM for the p75 and the p55 TNFRs, respectively. Furthermore, as in the case of TNF, LTα appeared to bind to both the p55 and the p75 TNFRs with comparable affinity constants in Fs4 and KYM-1 cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the difference in specific activity between TNF and LTα in Fs4 and KYM-1 cells cannot be explained by the differences in affinities of LTα and TNF to the p55 and p75 TNFRs. The equilibrium binding experiments described above revealed no major differences between TNF and LTα which could explain the large differences in biological activity between the cell lines. To further examine the binding of these cytokines to their receptors, we therefore studied the dynamic interactions between receptors and ligands by measurements of the rates of dissociation. As shown in Fig. 5A, TNF rapidly dissociated from the p75 TNFR cells. In striking contrast to this, LTα appeared to have a relatively slow rate of dissociation from this receptor, indicating that the on-off rate of the LTα•p75 complex is much slower than the on-off rate of the TNF•p75 complex. The experiments shown were performed at room temperature and indicate at least a 6-fold difference between TNF and LTα in the rate of dissociation from the p75 TNFR at this temperature (t½~5 min for TNF versus more than 30 min for LTα). The rate of dissociation for LTα and TNF from the p55 TNFR appeared to be indistinguishable, and somewhat lower (t½ > 60 min) than the rate of dissociation for LTα from the p75 TNFR (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that there are major differences between TNF and LTα in their interaction with the p75 TNFR, whereas the experiments reveal no differences in the interaction with the p55 TNFR. At least two predictions can be made on the basis of the results described above. First, soluble p55 TNFR may be more potent than soluble p75 TNFR in inhibiting TNF effects, and, second, both receptors could be equally potent in decreasing LTα activity. To test this, murine WEHI clone 13 fibroblasts were incubated with TNF or LTα alone, in the presence or in the absence of soluble recombinant TNFRs. As shown in Fig. 6, soluble p55 TNFR was more potent than soluble p75 TNFR in inhibiting TNF cyto"

Nuclear run-off assays demonstrated that kidney-specific expression of Nkcc2 was due, at least in part, to kidney-specific gene transcription. To begin study of the gene promoter, a genomic clone that contained 13.5 kilobases of the 5′-flanking region of Nkcc2 was isolated. A single transcription initiation site was located 1330 base pairs (bp) upstream of the start codon. The sequence of the proximal 5′-flanking region contained typical eukaryotic promoter elements including a TATA box, two CCAAT boxes, and an initiator. A (G-A)28•(C-T)28 microsatellite and consensus binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1, cAMP-response element binding protein, CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins, and basic helix-loop-helix proteins, were also identified. To functionally express the promoter, 2255 bp of the proximal 5′-flanking region was ligated to a luciferase reporter gene and transfected into thick ascending limb (TAL) cells, a stable cell line derived from microdissected loops of Henle of the Tg(SV40E)Bri7 mouse. TAL cells exhibited furosemide-sensitive Na-K(NH4+)-Cl cotransport activity and endogenously expressed the 5.0-kilobase Nkcc2 transcript. Luciferase activity was 130-fold greater following transfection into TAL cells compared with transfection into cells that did not express Nkcc2 (NIH 3T3 fibroblasts). Deletion analysis revealed that promoter activity in TAL cells was similar in constructs extending from the transcription initiation site to −1529 to −469, whereas further deletion to −190 resulted in a 76% decrease in activity. We conclude that the Nkcc2 promoter exhibits kidney cell-specific activity. Regulatory elements required for maximal promoter activity are located in a 280-bp DNA segment that contains consensus binding sites for several transcription factors expressed in the kidney.

INTRODUCTIONRelatively little is known regarding molecular mechanisms of tissue-specific gene expression in the kidney, particularly when compared with other organs such as the liver.

Also, promoters of the THP, aquaporin-2, and V2 vasopressin receptor genes have been cloned and characterized(1.Yu H. Papa F. Sukhatme V.P. Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 63-75PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Uchida S.

However, to date, no enhancer elements or kidney-specific transcription factors that are responsible for tissue-specific expression of these genes have been identified.We have examined the murine renal Na-K-Cl cotransporter gene (Nkcc2) as a model for kidney-specific gene expression. The Na-K-Cl cotransporters are a family of integral plasma membrane proteins that mediate coupled transport of Na+, K+, and Cl− with a stoichiometry of 1:1:2 and are characteristically sensitive to inhibition by loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide(4.Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). cDNAs that encode two distinct isoforms of bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-Cl cotransporters, termed NKCC1 and NKCC2, have been cloned. NKCC1 (also called BSC2) has been cloned from the shark rectal gland, mouse inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD-3) cells, and human colonic carcinoma (T84) cells(5.Xu J.C. Lytle C. Zhu T.

In secretory epithelia, such as the shark rectal gland, the Nkcc1 gene product is a 195-kDa protein that is localized exclusively in the basolateral membrane and is activated by phosphorylation(4.Payne J.A.

Thus, NKCC1 represents the secretory Na-K-Cl cotransporter that operates in series with apical Cl− channels to achieve net Cl− secretion.

Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Igarashi P. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 557-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding NKCC2 have been cloned from the kidney in rabbit, rat, and mouse(9.Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4544-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 10.Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S. Hediger M.A. Hebert S.C. J. Biol.

The NKCC2 protein is predicted to contain 12 transmembrane segments, and the amino acid sequence of murine NKCC2 is 64% identical to murine NKCC1. Northern blot analysis of adult tissues revealed that Nkcc2, in contrast to Nkcc1, is expressed as a 5.0-kb transcript that is only detected in the kidney (9.Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4544-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 10.Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S. Hediger M.A. Hebert S.C. J. Biol.

Moreover, within the kidney, expression of Nkcc2 is restricted to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TALH)(10.Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S. Hediger M.A. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17713-17722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the rat NKCC2 (BSC1) protein was immunolocalized to the apical membrane of the cortical and medullary TALH(12.Kaplan M.R. Plotkin M.D. Lee W.S. Xu Z.C. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 40-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, NKCC2 represents the apical Na-K-Cl cotransporter that mediates active reabsorption of NaCl in the TALH and is the clinically important site of action of loop diuretics. Studies using in situ hybridization of mouse embryos revealed that Nkcc2 transcripts are expressed in the metanephros but are absent from all other nonrenal tissues, verifying that Nkcc2 is kidney-specific in both adult and developing animals(11.Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar). In the developing metanephros, Nkcc2 transcripts are absent from the nephrogenic zone, which contains uninduced mesenchyme, ureteric buds, and early epithelial structures (renal vesicles, S-shaped bodies), but are highly expressed in more mature nephrons, specifically in distal limbs of developing loops of Henle(11.Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of embryonic mouse kidneys confirmed that Nkcc2 is induced at 14.5 days postcoitus, which corresponds to stages of nephrogenesis after development of the first S-shaped bodies. Taken together, these results indicate that Nkcc2 is a kidney-specific gene that is a marker for differentiation of the loop of Henle during kidney development.The present study was undertaken to begin examining the molecular basis for kidney-specific expression of the murine Nkcc2 gene. The specific aims were to determine whether kidney-specific expression of Nkcc2 had a transcriptional basis, to clone and sequence the promoter of the Nkcc2 gene, and to evaluate whether the activity of the Nkcc2 promoter was kidney cell-specific.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMice (males, age 35 days or older, strain CD-1 or C57BL/6J) were obtained from Charles River or the Jackson Laboratory. RNase H-free murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs or Boehringer Mannheim. pGL3 plasmids, luciferin, and reporter lysis buffer were from Promega. Human growth hormone assay kits were from Nichols Institute Diagnostics. Nylon filters (Hybond-N) were from Amersham Corp., and nitrocellulose filters were from Schleicher & Schuell. Radionucleotides were from Amersham or DuPont NEN. Other reagents were of molecular biological grade from Sigma, Promega, Boehringer Mannheim, or U.S. Biochemical Corp.Nuclear Run-off AssaysNuclear run-off assays were performed using an adaptation of the method of Celano et al.(14.Celano P. Berchtold C. Casero Jr., R.A. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 942-944PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei were harvested from tissues (1 g) by homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes, pestle B) in medium containing 0.32 M sucrose, 3 mM CaCl2, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0). All experiments were conducted at 0-4°C in the presence of 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged briefly, and the supernatant was rehomogenized in the same medium without Triton X-100 (10 strokes). The sucrose concentration was adjusted to 1.37 M, and the presence of free nuclei was verified by phase contrast microscopy. Nuclei in a final volume of 8 ml were layered over a 3-ml cushion containing 2 M sucrose, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0). Samples were centrifuged at 107,000 × g for 45 min, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of storage buffer containing 25% glycerol, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0). Nuclei were used immediately or stored frozen overnight at −70°C, which gave equivalent results. Run-off transcription was performed by incubating nuclei (5 × 107) for 1 h at 26°C in medium containing 35% glycerol; 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5); 5 mM MgCl2; 80 mM KCl; 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM DTT; 1 μl of RNAsin (Promega); 4 mM each ATP, GTP, CTP; and [α-32P]UTP (200 μCi, 3000 μCi/mmol). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200-500 units of RNase-free DNase I and CaCl2 (1 mM final) followed by incubation at 26°C for 30 min. Proteinase K (20 μg), yeast tRNA (50 μg), and SDS (0.5% final) were added, and samples were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C. RNA was isolated by extraction with RNAzol B (Biotecx Labs) and chloroform and precipitation of the aqueous phase with isopropyl alcohol. Following centrifugation and washing with 70% ethanol, the pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.2), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. Radiolabeled transcripts (1 × 107 cpm/ml) were hybridized in glass scintillation vials with nitrocellulose filters spotted with 5 μg of denatured plasmid encoding murine NKCC2 (clone 3′-R27, nucleotides 1277-4655 in GenBank™ data base accession number U20973), pRGAPD-13 encoding rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), or empty pBluescript. Hybridization was performed for 36 h at 65°C in medium containing 10 mM TES (pH 7.4), 10 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 0.6 M NaCl, and 5 × Denhardt's reagent. Filters were washed with 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 1 h, 0.1 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 65°C for 1 h, then exposed in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Library ScreeningA mouse genomic library in λFIXII (strain 129/Sv, catalog number 946305) was purchased from Stratagene and screened by filter hybridization with a 32P-labeled murine Nkcc2 cDNA (clone λ8) as described previously (11.Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar). Clones that were positive on duplicate filters were plaque-purified, and the genomic inserts were restriction-mapped using single or double digests with SacI, XbaI, or SalI. Restriction fragments were transferred to nylon membranes, and end fragments and exon-containing fragments were identified as described previously(11.Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar). A 3.5-kb XbaI/SnaBI restriction fragment that contained sequences at the 5′ end of the transcript was subcloned into XbaI/EcoRV-digested pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) and sequenced completely. Overlapping sequence of both strands was obtained using a combination of manual and automated methods(11.Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed using MacVector version 4.1 software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Unless indicated otherwise, consensus sequences of eukaryotic promoter elements were from compilations by Locker (15.Locker J. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 321-345Google Scholar) or Faisst and Meyer(16.Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar).Primer Extension AnalysisThe 5′ ends of the murine Nkcc2 transcripts were identified using ligation-anchored PCR and primer extension analysis. Ligation-anchored PCR was performed as described previously(11.Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products were isolated on low melting agarose gels, cloned into the plasmid pCRII (Invitrogen), and sequenced. Primer extension analysis was performed using an antisense oligonucleotide (GGCTTCGGTTTTAGATGACCCGATA) that was complementary to the 5′-untranslated region of mouse Nkcc2 (nucleotides −107 to −131 with respect to the translation start codon, Fig. 5B). The oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase and then incubated overnight at 30°C with 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA in hybridization medium containing 40 mM PIPES (pH 6.4), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 60% formamide. Hybridization products were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in medium containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3); 75 mM KCl; 3 mM MgCl2; 1 mM DTT; 10 mM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP; and 1.2 μl of RNAsin (Promega). RNase H-free murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 units) was added, and samples were incubated for 2 h at 42°C. The reaction was quenched with EDTA, extracted with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. Reaction products were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels.Northern Blot AnalysisPoly(A)+ RNA was purified from tissues and confluent monolayers of cells as described previously(11.Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Igarashi P. Freed M.I. Ganz M.B. Reilly R.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F83-F88PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was electrophoresed on denaturing formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon filters (Hybond-N). Northern blots were hybridized with an antisense 32P-labeled riboprobe that was transcribed from the murine Nkcc2 cDNA clone λ10 as described previously(11.Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed overnight at 60°C in medium containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.2% SDS, 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 200 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 2 × 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled riboprobe. Northern blot was washed twice for 30 min at 68°C in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70°C with a single intensifying screen.Mammalian Cell Culture and Transport AssaysTAL cells were obtained by microdissection of TALH segments from kidneys of a transgenic mouse (Tg(SV40E)Bri7) carrying the SV40 large T antigen, as described previously(18.Kaunitz J.D. Cummins V.P.S. Mishler D. Nagami G.T. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1993; 33: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The presence of the large T antigen immortalizes the expressing cells. Initially, microdissected cells were grown on fibronectin-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (50:50) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After passage 8, TAL cells were grown in medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum, 5 nM sodium selenite, and 0.03 nM insulin under an atmosphere containing 35% O2 and 5% CO2. Growth in the presence of elevated oxygen tension was essential for the expression of differentiated properties. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. S1 cells, an established line derived from the proximal tubule of the Tg(SV40E)Bri7 mouse, were grown as described previously(18.Kaunitz J.D. Cummins V.P.S. Mishler D. Nagami G.T. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1993; 33: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Na-K-Cl cotransport activity in TAL cells was measured as furosemide-sensitive NH4+ influx. TAL cells were grown to confluence on plastic coverslips and then incubated at 37°C in 140 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaH2PO4, and 1 mM CaCl2. All solutions were gassed with 100% O2, and experiments were performed in the nominal absence of HCO3−. Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured using the permeant, pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2-biscarboxyethyl-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) as described previously(19.Nagami G.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells on coverslips were preloaded with BCECF-AM for 15 min, washed with the HEPES-buffered solution, and then mounted in a microfluorometer. After a steady base-line fluorescence ratio was obtained, 10 mM NH4Cl was added to the medium (isosmotically replacing NaCl) in the presence or absence of 1 mM furosemide. pHi was calculated from the ratio of emission fluorescence at 535 nm obtained at alternating excitation wavelengths of 495 and 440 nm, and calibration was performed at the completion of each experiment using the nigericin-high potassium technique.Construction of Reporter PlasmidsReporter plasmids used in this study were derived from pGL3-Basic (Promega). The 3.5-kb XbaI/SnaBI restriction fragment of genomic clone λLMH8 (see “Results”) was excised from pBluescript II KS(+) by digestion with XbaI and SalI and then subcloned into unique NheI and XhoI sites in pGL3-Basic. The resulting plasmid (designated pGL3B-NKCC2) contained 2255 bp of proximal 5′-flanking region cloned in the sense orientation upstream to a promoterless luciferase gene. pGL3-Control, which contains a luciferase gene driven by the SV40 early region promoter/enhancer, and empty pGL3-Basic were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. To generate plasmids containing nested deletions of the proximal 5′-flanking region, most of the 5′-untranslated region including the first intron was first removed from pGL3B-NKCC2 using the unique site elimination method of Deng and Nickoloff(20.Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotide was GCTTACTTAGATCGCAGATCTGCAGCCTTCTTCTGAGC, which deleted the sequence 3′ to nucleotide +23 (numbered with respect to the transcription start site). The selection oligonucleotide was GTAAGAGCTCGATATCTATCGATAG, which converted a unique, nonessential KpnI site in pGL3 into an EcoRV site. The primers were annealed to denatured pGL3B-NKCC2, and the gaps were filled with native T7 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase. DNA was digested with KpnI and transformed into a mismatch repair-defective (mutS) strain of Escherichia coli. Plasmids were recovered by alkaline lysis minipreps, redigested with KpnI, and retransformed into E. coli strain XL1-Blue. The resulting plasmid was sequenced to confirm removal of 5′-untranslated region and transfected into TAL cells to verify that luciferase activity was unaffected (data not shown). The plasmid was then digested with EcoRV and PvuII, SmaI, XhoI, SacI, or SpeI; end-filled with T4 DNA polymerase if necessary; and recircularized to generate plasmids containing segments of the Nkcc2 gene extending from +23 to −1529, −1087, −835, −469, or −190, respectively. The 5′ termini of the fragments were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Plasmid DNA for transfections was purified by alkaline lysis and passage over silica columns (Qiagen).Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene AssaysLuciferase reporter plasmids were introduced into cultured mammalian cells (TAL cells, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts) using cationic liposomes (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies). Cells were plated on 100-mm plastic dishes at a density of 0.5-1 × 106 cells/dish. After 24-48 h, the cells achieved 50-60% confluency and were washed once with Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Life Technologies) immediately prior to use. Each dish of cells was transfected with 4 μg of reporter plasmid and 4 μg of pXGH5 encoding human growth hormone as a control for transfection efficiency(21.Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA (8 μg total) and cationic liposomes (48 μl) were first added to Opti-MEM I in separate tubes to a total volume of 300 μl each. The solutions were combined and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. An additional 2.4 ml of Opti-MEM I was added, and the mixture was applied to one dish of cells, which was then returned to the tissue culture incubator. After 6 h of incubation at 37°C, 3 ml of standard culture medium containing twice the usual concentration of fetal bovine serum were added. 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with standard growth medium, and cells were incubated for an additional 48 h prior to assay.Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using methods similar to those described previously(22.Blaurock M.C. Rebouças N.A. Kusnezov J.L. Igarashi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with Ca2+-, Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by incubation for 20 min at room temperature in 900 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Lysed cells were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and freeze-thawed once using a dry ice-ethanol bath. After brief vortexing and centrifugation at 14,000 × g to remove cell debris, 20 μl of supernatant was aliquoted into 75 × 12-mm plastic tubes (Sarstedt). The reaction was initiated by rapid addition of 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) containing 20 mM of Tricine (pH 7.8), 1.07 mM (MgCO3)4•Mg(OH)2•5H20, 2.67 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33.3 mM DTT, 270 μM coenzyme A, 530 μM ATP, and 470 μM luciferin. Light output was integrated over 10 s at room temperature using an Optocomp I photon-counting luminometer (MGM Instruments). Data were normalized for growth hormone concentration, which was measured in the conditioned medium using a solid phase radioimmunoassay according to the manufacturer's directions (Nichols Institute Diagnostics). Luciferase measurements were performed in triplicate, and measurements of growth hormone were performed in duplicate. Standard curves were generated in each experiment to insure that results were within the linear range of the assay.Statistical AnalysisThe mean data from independent experiments using different cell preparations are reported. Error bars are ± S.E. Data were analyzed using Student's t test for paired data. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.RESULTSKidney-specific Transcription of the Nkcc2 GeneExpression of Nkcc2 transcripts is kidney-specific in the adult and embryonic mouse(11.Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases, tissue-specific expression is regulated at the level of initiation of gene transcription. However, there also exist examples in which tissue specificity is primarily due to post-transcriptional regulation(23.Gagnon M.L. Angerer L.M. Angerer R.C. Development. 1992; 114: 457-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Marty L. Dani C. Panabieres F. El Sabouty S. Fort P. Jeanteur P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6951-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). This was potentially the case for Nkcc2 in which tissue-specific alternative splicing has been observed(9.Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4544-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 11.Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, to determine whether transcription of the Nkcc2 gene was kidney-specific, nuclear run-off assays were performed. Nuclei were harvested from mouse renal medulla (which expresses Nkcc2 transcripts) and mouse liver (which does not express Nkcc2), and nascent transcripts were elongated"

https://openalex.org/W2021745892,"PKN is a fatty acid-activated serine/threonine kinase that has a catalytic domain highly homologous to that of protein kinase C in the carboxyl terminus and a unique regulatory region in the amino terminus. Recently, we reported that the small GTP-binding protein Rho binds to the amino-terminal region of PKN and activates PKN in a GTP-dependent manner, and we suggested that PKN is located on the downstream of Rho in the signal transduction pathway (Amano, M., Mukai, H., Ono, Y., Chihara, K., Matsui, T., Hamajima, Y., Okawa, K., Iwamatsu, A., and Kaibuchi, K.(1996) Science 271, 648-650; Watanabe, G., Saito, Y., Madaule, P., Ishizaki, T., Fujisawa, K., Morii, N., Mukai, H., Ono, Y. Kakizuka, A., and Narumiya, S.(1996) Science 271, 645-648). To identify other components of the PKN pathway such as substrates and regulatory proteins of PKN, the yeast two-hybrid strategy was employed. By this screening, a clone encoding the neurofilament L protein, a subunit of neuron-specific intermediate filament, was isolated. The amino-terminal regulatory region of PKN was shown to associate with the head-rod domains of other subunits of neurofilament (neurofilament proteins M and H) as well as neurofilament L protein in yeast cells. The direct binding between PKN and each subunit of neurofilament was confirmed by using the in vitro translated amino-terminal region of PKN and glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the head-rod domain of each subunit of neurofilament. PKN purified from rat testis phosphorylated each subunit of the native neurofilament purified from bovine spinal cord and the bacterially synthesized head-rod domain of each subunit of neurofilament. Polymerization of neurofilament L protein in vitro was inhibited by phosphorylation of neurofilament L protein by PKN. The identification and characterization of the novel interaction with PKN may contribute toward the elucidation of mechanisms regulating the function of neurofilament.

The identification and characterization of the novel interaction with PKN may contribute toward the elucidation of mechanisms regulating the function of neurofilament. INTRODUCTIONWe have reported a novel serine/threonine protein kinase, designated PKN, having a catalytic domain homologous to the PKC 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CPKAprotein kinase ANFneurofilamentNFLneurofilament LNFHneurofilament HNFMneurofilament MDTTdithiothreitolGSTglutathione S-transferaseGal4adtranscription activation domain of Gal4Gal4bdDNA binding domain of Gal4VP16adtranscription activation domain of VP16LexAbdDNA binding domain of LexAPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)NAKneurofilament-associated kinase. family and unique amino-terminal sequences(1.Mukai H.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of PKN contains repeats of a leucine zipper-like motif, suggesting promotion of protein-protein association through hydrophobic interactions(3.Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar), and the basic region adjacent to the first leucine zipper-like motif, which is conserved through evolution in vertebrates (4.Mukai H.

Acta. 1995; 1261: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and among the various isoforms of PKN(5.Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the previous study, we demonstrated that truncation of the amino-terminal region of PKN by limited proteolysis results in the generation of the catalytically active form in vitro, and unsaturated fatty acid and some detergent can remove restriction of the catalytic activity by its amino-terminal region at relatively low concentrations in vitro(1.Mukai H. Kitagawa M. Shibata H. Takanaga H. Mori K. Shimakawa M. Miyahara M. Hirao K. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6.Kitagawa M. Mukai H. Shibata H. Ono Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, regions contained in the amino-terminal portion of PKN are presumed to be critical for the regulation of the biological activity of this enzyme.Recently, we demonstrated that Rho, a small GTP-binding protein, binds to PKN in a GTP-dependent fashion and that this binding leads to the activation of PKN(7.Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 8.Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), suggesting that PKN is one of the targets of Rho. Several reports have been accumulated showing that multiple protein-protein interactions within the regulatory region of serine/threonine protein kinases are important for the regulation of the enzyme activities in vivo, such as Raf-1 and p21-activated protein kinase(9.Manser E.

For example, current models of Raf-1 activation suggest that this kinase is bound in a native complex with 14-3-3 proteins (10.Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R. Science. 1994; 265: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 11.Irie K. Gotoh Y. Yashar B.M. Errede B. Nishida E. Matsumoto K.

Raf-1 also binds to Ras in a GTP-dependent fashion (14.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar, 15.Zhang X.F.

Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and active Ras is thought to recruit Raf-1 to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with other modulators of its activity and relevant substrates(18.Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 19.Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The binding site on Raf-1 for 14-3-3 proteins is distinct from the Ras binding domain, and Raf-1 molecules bound to 14-3-3 proteins may simultaneously bind to Ras(10.Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R. Science. 1994; 265: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 11.Irie K. Gotoh Y. Yashar B.M. Errede B. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1994; 265: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In our preliminary experiment, PKN immunoreactivity in the crude extract from rat brain was eluted broadly on gel filtration, suggesting that PKN formed complexes. Thus, in the analogy with Raf-1, we attempted to identify other proteins that interact with PKN and potentially regulate its activity by using a yeast two-hybrid system, with the amino-terminal regulatory region of PKN as a target protein. By this screening, a cDNA clone encoding the head-rod domain of NFL, a subunit of neuron-specific intermediate filament protein, was isolated from a human brain cDNA library. In this report we characterize the interaction between PKN and each subunit of NF and vimentin and raise the possibility that PKN can play a role in the regulation of assembly of NF and provide a potential junction from signals generated by growth factor stimulation to intermediate filaments.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTwo-hybrid Screens and Constructs for the Two-hybrid SystemA scheme of the fusion constructs for each subunit of NF used in this study is represented in Fig. 1. An EcoRI/BamHI fragment encoding amino acids 1-540 of human PKN, designated as PKNN1, was inserted into the vector pGBT9 (20.Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). This plasmid, which contains a TRP1 marker, was cotransfected with the human brain cDNA library constructed using pGAD10 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.; each plasmid contains a LEU2 marker) into the yeast strain YGH1 (a, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu2-3, Canr, gal4-542, gal80-538, LYS2::gal1uas-gal1tata-HIS3, URA3::gal1-lacZ). Screening was performed as described by Hannon et al.(21.Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). About 1 × 106 transformants were analyzed. Primary positive clones were recovered and retransfected into the original yeast host strain in combination with the Gal4bd-PKN or the Gal4bd-p53 tumor suppressor. Library plasmids that activated marker expression only in the presence of PKN were analyzed further.Other yeast expression vectors were prepared as follows. The yeast expression vector pVP/NFL#21, for VP16ad fused to the head-rod domain of human NFL, was made by subcloning an EcoRI insert (amino acids 1-349) of the library plasmid 21 originally isolated from two-hybrid screening into pVP16 vector. Vectors for VP16ad fused to the tail domain of NFL, VP16ad fused to the tail domain of NFH, VP16ad fused to the head-rod domain of NFM, and VP16ad fused to the tail domain of NFM were constructed by subcloning each BamHI/NotI insert of pGST/NFLt, pGST/NFHt, pGST/NFMhr, and pGST/NFMt (described later under “Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins”), respectively, into pVP16. pVP/NFHf, for VP16ad fused to the full length of NFH, was constructed by digesting pBH, a plasmid containing the entire coding region of NFH in pBluescript II SK vector (kindly provided by Dr. N. Hirokawa, University of Tokyo), with BglII, and the cDNA insert was subcloned into pVP16. pVP/NFHhr for VP16ad fused to the head-rod domain of NFH was made by digesting pVP/NFHf with Tth111I/EcoRI and filling in the ends with T4 DNA polymerase and ligating them together with T4 DNA ligase. This removed the DNA sequences 3′-terminal to the Tth111I site, which encodes the tail domain of NFH. pBTM/NFL#21 and pBTM/NFLt for LexAbd fused to the head-rod domain of NFL and LexAbd fused to the tail domain of NFL, respectively, were constructed as described above except for using pBTM116 instead of pVP16. pBTM/PKNN1 for LexAbd fused to PKNN1 and pVP/PKNN1 for VP16ad fused to PKNN1 were constructed by subcloning the EcoRI/BamHI fragment of human PKN into pBTM116 and pVP16, respectively. pBTM/PKNC1 for LexAbd fused to the carboxyl-terminal region of PKN (amino acids 511-942, this region was designated as PKNC1) and pVP/PKNC1 for VP16ad fused to PKNC1 were constructed by subcloning the ClaI/EcoRI fragment of human PKN into pBTM116 and pVP16, respectively.In Vitro Transcription and TranslationFor in vitro transcription, truncated human PKN was made as follows. pPKNN2 for the amino-terminal region of PKN (amino acids 1-474, this region was designated as PKNN2) was made by digesting phPKN-H4 (human PKN cDNA in pBluescript II SK; see (2.Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)) with BstEII, filling in the ends with T4 DNA polymerase, and self-ligating. This removed the original amino acid sequences carboxyl-terminal of the BstEII site (1425 nucleotides from the initiating ATG), and a stop codon was created in the plasmid sequence. The fragment encoding amino acids 614-942 (this region was designated as PKNC2) containing the conserved catalytic domain of human PKN was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification. pPKNC2 was made by subcloning this fragment into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen Corp.). These plasmids were linealized by cutting with XbaI, and cRNAs were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. For NFL, pBL (22.Nakagawa T. Chen J. Zhang Z. Kanai Y. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 411-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. N. Hirokawa) was linealized by cutting with HindIII, and cRNA was transcribed using T3 RNA polymerase. For in vitro translation, these cRNAs were translated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine.Preparation of GST Fusion ProteinspGST/NFL#21 for GST fused to NFL#21 (amino acids 1-349 of human NFL) was made by subcloning an EcoRI insert of plasmid 21 into the pGEX4T vector. pGST/NFLdelA for GST fused to NFLdelA (amino acids 1-175 and 335-349) was made by digesting a pGST/NFL#21 with PstI, removing the 480-base pair fragment, and self-ligating with T4 DNA ligase. pGST/NFLdelB for GST fused to NFLdelB (amino acid 245-349) was made by subcloning the BglII/EcoRI fragment of pGST/NFL#21 into the pGEX4T vector. pGST/NFLt for the GST fused to the tail domain of NFL was made by subcloning the ~700-base pair KpnI/EcoRI fragment of pBL into the pGEX4T vector. pGST/NFMhr for GST fused to the head-rod domain (411 amino acids of the amino-terminal region) of NFM was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification from a human hippocampus cDNA library and subcloning into the pGEX4T vector. pGST/NFLf for GST fused to the full length of NFL was constructed by subcloning the BamHI/EcoRI insert of pBL into the pGEX4T vector. pGST/NFMt for GST fused to the tail domain of NFM was made by subcloning the ~1.0-kilobase pair XhoI/NotI fragment of pBM (22.Nakagawa T. Chen J. Zhang Z. Kanai Y. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 411-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. N. Hirokawa) into the pGEX4T vector. pGST/NFHf for GST fused to the full length of NFH was constructed by digesting pBH with BglII, and the cDNA insert was subcloned into the BamHI restriction site of the pGEX4T vector. pGST/NFHhr for GST fused to the head-rod domain of NFH was made by digesting pGST/NFHf with Tth111I/EcoRI, filling in the ends with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligating them together with T4 DNA ligase. This removed the DNA sequences 3′-terminal to the Tth111I site, which encodes the tail domain of NFH. pGST/NFHt for GST fused to the tail domain of NFH was made by digesting pBH with Tth111I/BglII, filling in the ends, and subcloning the ~2-kilobase pair fragment into the pGEX4T vector.Expression and purification of GST or GST fusion proteins were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) The eluate from glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was dialyzed overnight against 10 mM Tris/HCl at pH 8.8 containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin.In Vitro Binding Assay-For the in vitro NF binding experiment, 2.5 μl of in vitro translated PKNN2 or PKNC2 was mixed with 5 μg of each GST-NF fusion protein or with 25 μg of GST alone in 400 μl of GST binding buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 0.5 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. After the addition of 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B pretreated with 10 mg/ml Escherichia coli extract to block nonspecific binding, the binding reaction was continued for an additional 30 min at 4°C. The glutathione-Sepharose 4B was then washed three times in GST wash buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100 and washed further with GST wash buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with GST elution buffer (100 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 20 mM glutathione, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The binding was visualized and quantitated by an imaging analyzer (Fuji BAS1000).Preparation of NF Proteins from Native Bovine TissuesNF proteins were prepared from bovine spinal cords as reported(23.Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Kinase AssaySoluble cytosolic extract of spinal cord or purified NF proteins were boiled for 5 min to destroy endogenous protein kinase activity before use as phosphate acceptors. The phosphorylation of NF preparations was carried out at 30°C in an assay mixture containing 20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 8 mM MgCl2, 100 μM ATP, 185 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP, phosphate acceptors, 20 ng/ml PKN purified from rat testis(6.Kitagawa M. Mukai H. Shibata H. Ono Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), with/without 40 μM arachidonic acid as indicated in each experiment. After incubation for various times, the reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of Laemmli's sample buffer and separated on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried under vacuum, and the phosphorylation was visualized by an imaging analyzer (Fuji BAS1000). Dephosphorylation of NF proteins was conducted with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase as described(24.Carden M.J. Schlaepfer W.W. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9805-9817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NF proteins were boiled for 5 min to destroy phosphatase activity.Effects of Phosphorylation on the Polymerization of NFLFor the in vitro NF polymerization experiment, phosphorylated forms of bacterially synthesized GST fused to the full length of NFL and GST fused to NFL#21 were prepared by incubation of 5 μg of these proteins with 1 mM MgCl2, 60 ng of PKN, and 100 μM ATP for 2 h at 30°C. Bacterially synthesized proteins incubated with PKN in the absence of ATP were employed as a nonphosphorylated control. 2.5 μl of in vitro translated NFL was added to the above mixtures in depolymerization buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 8.5, 1 mM DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM MgCl2), then the pH of the reaction mixture was shifted to 7.2 by the addition of appropriate volumes of 1 M PIPES at pH 6.8 and incubated for 1 h at 35°C. After adding 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B pretreated with 10 mg/ml E. coli extract to block nonspecific binding, the binding reactions were continued for an additional 30 min at 4°C. The glutathione-Sepharose 4B was then washed twice in depolymerization buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and washed further with depolymerization buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with GST elution buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Quantitation of the binding reactions was carried out by an imaging analyzer (Fuji BAS1000).RESULTSIsolation of PKN-binding Proteins Using the Yeast Two-hybrid SystemTo identify proteins that interact with the amino-terminal region of human PKN, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. The chimeric protein construct contained the DNA binding domain of the GAL4 protein fused to the unique amino-terminal region of human PKN. The 82 plasmids were isolated representing 16 different cDNAs as judged by DNA sequencing. One of these cDNAs encoded the head-rod domain of NFL protein. Specificity of this interaction was tested further by measuring the ability of other combinations of the two-hybrid constructs, LexAbd (instead of Gal4bd)-PKN and VP16ad (instead of Gal4ad)-NF, or LexAbd-NF and VP16ad-PKN, to support lacZ expression in L40 cells. Fig. 2 summarizes these data and demonstrates a specific interaction between the amino-terminal region of PKN and the head-rod domain of NFL. To characterize further the interaction between PKN and NFL, we tested the ability of in vitro translated PKN to bind to GST-NFL in an in vitro binding assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, the amino-terminal region of PKN bound to the head-rod domain of NFL, and little binding of the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of PKN to the head-rod domain of NFL was observed in this assay.Figure 2:Interaction between portions of PKN and NF in the two-hybrid system. For each transformation, five independent colonies were picked from nonselected (His+) plates, patched, and grown for 3 days before they were tested for production of β-galactosidase. The data are representative of these colonies and three independent transformations. Panel A, interaction between PKN and NFL. Plasmids for VP16ad (pVP16; lines 7 and 10), VP16ad fused to the head-rod domain of NFL (pVP/NFL#21; lines 1-3), VP16ad fused to the tail domain of NFL (pVP/NFLt; lines 4-6), VP16ad fused to PKNN1 (pVP/PKNN1; lines 8 and 11), and VP16ad fused to PKNC1 (pVP/PKNC1; lines 9 and 12) were transformed into yeast with the plasmids for LexAbd (pBTM116; lines 1 and 4), LexAbd fused to the head-rod domain of NFL (pBTM/NFL#21; lines 7-9), LexAbd fused to the tail domain of NFL (pBTM/NFLt; lines 10-12), LexAbd fused to PKNN1 (pBTM/PKNN1; lines 2 and 5), and LexAbd fused to PKNC1 (pBTM/PKNC1; lines 3 and 6). Panel B, interaction between the amino-terminal region of PKN and each subunit of NF. Plasmids for VP16ad fused to the head-rod domain of NFL (pVP/NFL#21; line 1), VP16ad fused to the head-rod domain of NFM (pVP/NFMhr; line 2), VP16ad fused to the head-rod domain of NFH (pVP/NFHhr; line 3), VP16ad fused to the tail domain of NFL (pVP/NFLt; line 4), VP16ad fused to the tail domain of NFM (pVP/NFMt; line 5), and VP16ad fused to the tail domain of NFH (pVP/NFHt; line 6) were transformed into yeast with LexAbd fused to PKNN1 (pBTM/PKNN1; lines 1-6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:In vitro association of PKN with each subunit of NF. 35S-Labeled in vitro translated PKN was incubated with bacterially synthesized GST or GST-fused NF proteins. GST or GST-fused proteins were collected with glutathione-Sepharose beads (G-beads), analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and followed by autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of the initial binding reaction mixtures (10 μl) were removed before precipitation and applied to electrophoresis (Input). For reference, molecular mass markers are indicated in kDa at the left. Shown are typical results from three independent experiments. Panel A, interaction between PKN and various deletion mutant of NFL. The amino-terminal region of PKN (PKNN2) or the carboxyl-terminal region of PKN (PKNC2) was incubated with GST (lanes 4, 6, 10, and 12) or GST fused to various deletion fragments of NFL (GST/NFL#21, lanes 1, 5, 7, and 11; GST/NFLdelA, lanes 2 and 8; GST/NFLdelB, lanes 3 and 9). Panel B, interaction between the amino-terminal region of PKN and the head-rod domain of each subunit of NF. PKNN2 was incubated with GST (lanes 4 and 8) or GST fused to the head-rod domain of NFL (GST/NFL#21, lanes 1 and 5), the head-rod domain of NFM (GST/NFMhr, lanes 2 and 6), and the head-rod domain of NFH (GST/NFHhr, lanes 3 and 7). The position of labeled protein is indicated by a white arrowhead.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We reported previously that RhoA binds to the amino-terminal region of PKN. Given the interaction of NFL with the amino-terminal regulatory region of PKN, it was possible that this protein interacts with the Rho binding domain of PKN and might compete with Rho for binding to PKN. In an in vitro binding assay, bacterially synthesized NFL did not compete with the bacterially synthesized RhoA for the binding to the amino-terminal region of PKN (data not shown).The Amino-terminal Region of PKN Binds to the Head-Rod Domain of Each Subunit of NFNF was composed of three subunits of low (66 kDa; NFL), medium (130 kDa; NFM), and high (180 kDa; NFH) molecular masses(25.Kaufmann E. Geisler N. Weber K. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26.Scott D. Smith K.E. O'Brien B.J. Angelides K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10736-10747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-helical rod domain of NF protein is conserved throughout these subunits of NF and the family of intermediate filaments, such as vimentin, and confers common structural characteristics to the polymers(27.Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). To determine whether the amino-terminal region of PKN binds to NFM or NFH as well as NFL, corresponding regions of the head-rod domain of NFM and NFH were also ligated to pVP16, and LacZ expression was measured in the two-hybrid system. The amino-terminal region of PKN bound to the head-rod domain of each subunit of NF (Fig. 2B) and also interacted with the corresponding head-rod domain of vimentin, a ubiquitously expressed member of intermediate filament, in the two-hybrid system (cDNA of vimentin was kindly provided by Dr. M. Inagaki, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology; data not shown). We also tested the ability of in vitro translated PKN to bind to each subunit of NF and found that PKN bound directly to each subunit of NF at the head-rod domain in vitro (Fig. 3B).Since NFL bound to the regulatory region of PKN, a possibility was raised that NFL affects the kinase activity of PKN. To test this possibility, we added various concentrations of the bacterially synthesized NFL to the PKN assay mixture and examined the phosphorylation activity using a synthetic peptide based on the pseudosubstrate site of PKC as a substrate(1.Mukai H. Kitagawa M. Shibata H. Takanaga H. Mori K. Shimakawa M. Miyahara M. Hirao K. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).

An ~80-amino acid region within the intracellular domain of the receptor, termed the death domain, is required for signaling NF-κB activation and cytotoxicity. A TNF-R1-associated protein TRADD has been discovered that interacts with the death domain of the receptor. Elevated expression of TRADD in cells triggers both NF-κB activation and programmed cell death pathways. The biological activities of TRADD have been mapped to a 111-amino acid region within the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. This region shows sequence similarity to the death domain of TNF-R1 and can self-associate and bind to the TNF-R1 death domain. We have performed an alanine scanning mutagenesis of TRADD's death domain to explore the relationship among its various functional properties. Mutations affecting the different activities of TRADD do not map to discrete regions but rather are spread over the entire death domain, suggesting that the death domain is a multifunctional unit. A mutant that separates cell killing from NF-κB activation by the TRADD death domain has been identified indicating that these two signaling pathways diverge with TRADD. Additionally, one of the TRADD mutants that fails to activate NF-κB was found to act as dominant negative mutant capable of preventing induction of NF-κB by TNFα. Such observations provide evidence that TRADD performs an obligate role in TNF-induced NF-κB activation.

https://openalex.org/W2134106576,"Our laboratory previously has shown apparent carrier-mediated glutathione (GSH) uptake across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in two animal models. In the present study, when Xenopus oocytes were injected with bovine brain capillary mRNA expression of intact GSH, uptake was observed after 3 days. When total mRNA was converted to cDNA and subfractionated with subsequent cRNA injection into oocytes, three distinct fractions (5, 7-8, and 11-12) expressed carrier-mediated intact GSH transport. Northern blot analysis established the presence of RcGshT, the previously cloned sodium-independent hepatic canalicular transporter, only in fraction 5. GSH transport activity in fraction 7 was significantly inhibited by replacement of NaCl with choline chloride and by sulfobromophthalein-GSH, neither of which affects RcGshT. The Na(+)-dependent GSH uptake kinetics exhibited high affinity (approximately 400 micron) and low affinity (approximately 10 mM) components. Fraction 11 expressed Na(+)-independent transport of intact GSH and also contained the GGT transcript. In conclusion, we have identified three distinct sized transcripts from bovine brain capillary mRNA which express GSH transport: one fraction expresses a novel Na(+)-dependent GSH uptake which can be dissociated unequivocally from both GGT and RcGshT for the first time and which may account for uptake of GSH against its electrochemical gradient at the BBB."
https://openalex.org/W1998139028,"Receptor-mediated endocytosis is the cellular mechanism by which type C receptors of natriuretic peptides exert their clearance function. In the present work, performed in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with wild type or mutated human kidney C receptors, we determined net endocytic rates (ER) of C receptor-ligand complexes, lysosomal hydrolysis of ligand (125I-labeled native atrial natriuretic factor, ANF1−28), and receptor recycling. Equilibrium ligand binding, immunocytochemistry, and immunoprecipitation were performed to characterize the transfected receptors. The net ER of recombinant wild type C receptors was ~6% of occupied receptors internalized per min, and C receptor-mediated lysosomal hydrolysis of ligand amounted to ~250% of specifically bound 125I-ANF1−28/h, with efficient recycling of internalized C receptors to the cell surface. Hypertonic sucrose reduced net ER and lysosomal hydrolysis of 125I-ANF1−28 more than 10-fold, indicating that endocytosis occurred via clathrin-coated pits. Total deletion of the cytoplasmic domain also reduced net ER and lysosomal hydrolysis of 125I-ANF1−28 by almost 10-fold, whereas deletion of the terminal 28 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail led to a 4-fold reduction in these parameters. Replacement of cytoplasmic domain Tyr508 by Ala, or Tyr508 and Phe538 by Ala, reduced net endocytosis and lysosomal hydrolysis of 125I-ANF1−28 by 40-50%. Replacement of extracellular domain Cys473 by Ala impeded the constitutive formation of homodimers and reduced by ~50% the net ER and lysosomal hydrolysis of 125I-ANF1−28. These results demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of C receptors, Tyr508 within this domain, and constitutive receptor dimerization are the major molecular determinants of the clearance function of C receptors.

There are two functionally and biochemically distinct classes of receptors for natriuretic peptides. Guanylyl cyclase receptors (subtypes A and B) are signaling receptors that mediate the biological effects of natriuretic peptides via the generation of cGMP. Clearance (C) receptors play an important role in the removal of natriuretic peptides from the circulation, thus contributing to their plasma homeostasis(1.Atlas S.A. Maack T. Windhager E.E.

C receptors have a very high affinity for all members of the natriuretic peptide family, including ANF, type B natriuretic peptide, and type C natriuretic peptide, as well as truncated forms of natriuretic peptides containing as few as five amino acids from their ring structure(2.Maack T.

C receptors are more abundant than guanylyl cyclase receptors and are localized in tissues and cells that receive a large fraction of the cardiac output, including vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and the renal cortex(2.Maack T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 11-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Blockade of C receptors by specific ligands decreases the metabolic clearance of ANF and consequently increases its plasma levels in mammals(3.Maack T. Suzuki M. Almeida F.A. Nussenzveig D.

Thus, a major function of C receptors is to serve as a hormone buffer system to impede inappropriate alterations in plasma levels of natriuretic peptides(3.Maack T. Suzuki M. Almeida F.A. Nussenzveig D. Scarborough R.M. McEnroe G.A. Lewicki J.A. Science. 1987; 238: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Although there is some controversy over whether C receptors may also function as signaling receptors, it has been well documented that they do not mediate the major known cardiovascular, adrenal, and renal effects of natriuretic peptides(2.Maack T.

The C receptor is a ~60-kDa protein that is constitutively present in the cell membrane as a homodimer of ~120 kDa(2.Maack T. Annu. Rev.

The receptor has a large NH2-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of only 37 amino acids(6.Porter J.G. Wang Y.

However, the flanking sequences of tyrosine in the C receptor do not bear any resemblance to the degenerate sequences that contribute to rapid internalization of other receptors (e.g. NPXY or YXXZ, where X is any amino acid, and Z is a large hydrophobic amino acid)(7.Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are no other recognized internalization motifs (e.g. dileucine) in the cytoplasmic domain of C receptors. Our previous studies demonstrated that native C receptors in mammalian cells undergo rapid constitutive endocytosis that is not stimulated further by ligand binding. Endocytosed receptor-ligand complexes are then dissociated intracellularly, most probably in endosomes, with a subsequent hydrolysis of the ligand in lysosomes and an efficient recycling of the internalized receptors to the cell surface(14.Nussenzveig D.R. Lewicki J.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20952-20958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work we studied some of the molecular determinants of the clearance function of C receptors using cloned wild type and mutated human kidney C receptors transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The results show that the internalization of C receptors via clathrin-coated pits depends on the integrity of their cytoplasmic domain. Within this domain, tyrosine contributes significantly to rapid endocytosis, albeit to a lesser degree than in other receptors in which it is flanked by conserved internalization motifs. Constitutive dimerization of C receptors, a property conferred by an unpaired cysteine residue in the extracellular domain, markedly enhances endocytosis, demonstrating that constitutive polymerization is an important determinant for rapid internalization of these receptors. 35S-αATP for sequencing and 125I for radioiodination were obtained from Amersham Corp. [35S]Methionine-[35S]cysteine mixture was obtained from DuPont NEN. All restriction enzymes and M13mp18 RF were purchased from New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA. Host strains of Escherichia coli (JM109, MC 1061) and the DNA Sequenase kit were obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Rat ANF1−28 was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories Inc., Belmond, CA. Fetal and bovine calf serum were purchased from HyClone Laboratories, Logan UT. Unless otherwise indicated, all other chemicals, including culture media, enzymes, antibiotics, immunochemicals, buffers, and reagents were purchased from Sigma. The full-length recombinant human kidney C receptor was subcloned in the EcoRI cloning site of M13mp18 (15.Porter J.G. Arfsten A. Fuller F. Miller J.A. Gregory L.C. Lewicki J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 796-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Digestion with SmaI permitted selection of the correctly oriented vector, which was then used for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using either Zoller and Smith or Kunkel et al. methods(16.Zoller M.J. Smith M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6487-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 17.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

Sense mutagenic oligonucleotides containing at least 7 bases flanking the codon to be modified were synthesized and annealed to the wild type receptor (CRWT), according to standard techniques(18.Sambrook J.

The sequence of amino acids of the CRWT region of interest for the present study, and the corresponding sequences of the mutated receptors are depicted in Fig. 1. The following codons in the published nucleotide sequence of CRWT (15.Porter J.G. Arfsten A. Fuller F. Miller J.A. Gregory L.C. Lewicki J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 796-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were modified: codon 1877, AGG (Arg505) to the stop codon TAG, resulting in the truncation of the entire putative cytoplasmic domain (CRCYT-); codon 1904, AGG (Arg514) to TAG, resulting in the truncation of the last 28 amino acids from the COOH-terminal sequence of the cytoplasmic domain (CR514t); codon1 886, TAC (Tyr508) to GCC, resulting in the point mutated receptor CRA508; codon 1976, TTT (Phe538) to GCT, resulting in the mutant CRA538; codon 1886, TAC, and codon 1976, TTT, to GCC and GCT, respectively, resulting in the double mutant CRA508/A538; codon 1871, TGC (Cys473) to GCC, resulting in the mutant CRA473. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Sequenase). CRWT and mutated receptors were cloned in the EcoRI cloning site of a mammalian expression vector containing a β-actin promoter and a selectable neomycin-resistant gene (pAXNEO). Selection of correctly oriented recombinant vectors was obtained by restriction analysis of a SmaI-HindIII digest. Recombinant pAXNEOs containing the full-length CRWT or mutated C receptors were transfected into CHO-K1 cells by the calcium precipitation method followed by selection with Geneticin 418, according to standard procedures(18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two to three experimental and one mock transfection plate were prepared. Six to twelve recombinant cell clones were removed from the plates with cloning cylinders; the cell clones were expanded in culture flasks and then frozen until use. Recombinant cells were grown to near confluence in six-well plates to determine the density (Bmax) and affinity (Kd) of surface 125I-ANF1−28-specific binding sites. Pilot studies with several clones of CHO cells transfected with CRWT (CHOCRWT) indicated that the endocytic rate of C receptors was independent of the number of membrane receptors. Recombinant CHO cell clones with an adequate expression of high affinity specific binding sites for ANF (Bmax = 8,000-70,000 receptor sites/cell; Kd < 1 nM, Fig. 1) were selected for the experiments. In all instances, expression of the receptors at the cell surface was stable, remaining unchanged for at least 10 passages. Wild type and recombinant CHO cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.6 units/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. After reaching near confluence, the cells were plated at 1:10 or 1:5 dilutions in six-well plates. The cultures were incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Monolayers of wild type and recombinant CHO-K1 cells fixed with 2% formaldehyde were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy by standard techniques (19.Herzlinger D.A. Easton T.G. Ojakaian G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), using a previously characterized monoclonal antibody against human kidney C receptors(20.Porter, J. G., Silva, M., Catalano, R., Hummel, P., Marian-Scardina, J. (1993) Endocrine Society Abstracts 75th Meeting, Las Vegas, NV, p. 249Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate. Nonspecific fluorescence was assessed by omission of the primary antibody. Immunoprecipitation of wild type and recombinant CHO-K1 cells was performed by standard techniques(21.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to subconfluence in six-well plates and then incubated overnight with 1% bovine calf serum in 1:10 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium, 9:10 MEM select amine kit without methionine and cysteine, HEPES (20 mM), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.4 mCi/well [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine. For extraction of C receptors, monolayers were suspended in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl; 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0; 1% Triton X-100; 0.2% bovine serum albumin; and 2 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain). Cell extracts were precleared with protein A (Pansorbin, Calbiochem), reacted with monoclonal antibody against human kidney C receptor, and the resulting complexes were adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After sequential washes with lysis buffer, high salt (0.5 M NaCl) lysis buffer, and water, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS loading buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 60 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 0.001% bromphenol blue) with or without 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Samples were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed by standard procedures(21.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). 125I-ANF1−28 was prepared by a modification of the chloramine-T procedure and purified by HPLC as published previously(22.Suzuki M. Almeida F.A. Nussenzveig D.R. Sawyer D. Maack T. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F917-F928PubMed Google Scholar). The theoretical specific activity of 125I-ANF1−28 was 2200 Ci/mmol. The labeled peptide was aliquoted in 5-μCi fractions dissolved in water containing 2 mg/dl crystalline bovine albumin and stored at −70°C. The radioactivity was >95% precipitable with an equivolume of a 10% trichloroacetic acetic acid, 2% phosphotungstic acid solution (precipitation solution). Equilibrium competition binding experiments to obtain the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of receptor-ligand complexes and the apparent density of surface receptors (Bmax) were performed at 4°C, as published previously(14.Nussenzveig D.R. Lewicki J.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20952-20958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsinization-solubilization experiments in CHOCRWT were performed as described previously to determine the steady-state distribution of CRWT in the cell membrane and in the intracellular compartment(14.Nussenzveig D.R. Lewicki J.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20952-20958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dynamics of receptor-ligand complexes was determined by a slight modification of the steady-state protocol published previously by our laboratory(14.Nussenzveig D.R. Lewicki J.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20952-20958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, six-well plates with near confluent cell monolayers of recombinant CHO cells were washed twice with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with 1-2 ml of incubation medium in a shaking water bath at 37°C for several time intervals, up to 60 min. The incubation medium consisted of 1-2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2 mg/ml fraction V bovine albumin, 0.2-0.5 μCi of 125I-ANF1−28 with or without 1.3 nM unlabeled ANF1−28. Experiments were performed in presence or absence of 10 mM NH4Cl, a lysosomotropic weak base that blocks lysosomal hydrolysis of internalized radioligand(14.Nussenzveig D.R. Lewicki J.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20952-20958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine nonspecific binding, internalization, and hydrolysis, the cell monolayers were incubated in the presence of excess (0.5-1.0 μM) ANF1−28. At the end of each incubation time, the medium was removed for determination of precipitable and soluble radioactivity using the precipitation solution described above. Then, the monolayers were rapidly washed with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated on ice with hypertonic acid medium (0.2 M acetic acid in 0.5 M NaCl) for 15 min to remove radioligand bound to cell surface receptors (acid-sensitive radioactivity). Finally, the monolayers were washed again with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with 1 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 in 2 N NaOH for 1 h at room temperature to determine intracellular (acid-insensitive) radioactivity. The radioligand specifically bound to the cell surface remained nearly constant from 20 to 60 min of incubation (see Fig. 4). This allowed us to use a simplified steady-state protocol to determine lysosomal hydrolysis and endocytic rates of the radioligand. In this simplified protocol, 0.1 ml of medium was sampled from each well at several time intervals to determine precipitable and soluble radioactivity. At the end of the experiment (60 min), membrane-bound (acid-sensitive) and intracellular (acid-insensitive) radioactivity was determined as described above. In separate experiments, to block receptor internalization via coated pits, sucrose was added to the incubation medium to a final concentration of 0.44 M(23.Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Finally, in some experiments, 0.01-0.1 mM cycloheximide was added to the medium to inhibit protein synthesis(14.Nussenzveig D.R. Lewicki J.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20952-20958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess intact 125I-ANF1−28 and labeled hydrolytic products, samples of medium were precipitated with an equivolume of precipitation solution, as described above. The radioactivity in precipitated and soluble fractions of media, acid washes, and cell extracts was counted in a gamma scintillation counter. HPLC analysis of the nature of the soluble radioactivity in the medium revealed that it coeluted with [125I]monoiodotyrosine. Cells were counted with a hemocytometer. Net endocytic rates were determined by the formula ER = ((HM + IC)/M) × 100/t, where ER is the net endocytic rate of surface receptor-ligand complexes expressed as percent of occupied receptors internalized per min; HM is the specific soluble radioactivity in medium; IC is the specific acid-insensitive (intracellular) radioactivity; M is the specific acid-sensitive (membrane-bound) radioactivity; and t is the time (in min) of incubation at 37°C. Nonspecific binding, internalization, and non-receptor-mediated metabolism of 125I-ANF1−28 were <10% of the corresponding total values and were subtracted from these values to calculate the net endocytic rate. Lysosomal hydrolysis was determined by the specific NH4Cl-sensitive soluble radioactivity in the medium. Quantitative results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test among all groups. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Fig. 1 depicts the partial sequences of wild type and mutated C receptors, the apparent receptor-ligand (125I-ANF1−28) equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd), and the apparent surface densities (Bmax) of C receptors in the recombinant cells. Pilot experiments revealed that specific binding of 125I-ANF1−28 to nontransfected CHO-K1 cells was negligible, a finding that was confirmed by immunocytochemistry (see Fig. 2) and immunoprecipitation (see Fig. 3) The recombinant cell clones used in the experiments were selected to have an apparent density (Bmax) in the range of those reported for native C receptors in mammalian cells. The apparent affinity (Kd) for ANF1−28 in CHOCRWT and in all cells expressing point-mutated receptors was < 0.1 nM, a value similar to that reported previously for native C receptors in mammalian cells(2.Maack T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 11-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The apparent Kd of recombinant receptors with total deletion (CHOCRCYT-) or large truncation (CHOCR514t) of the cytoplasmic domain was still low (≤1 nM) but significantly higher than that of the wild type and point-mutated C receptors (p < 0.01). C-ANF4−23 (a specific ligand of C receptors) displaced specifically bound 125I-ANF1−28 from CHOCRWT with a Ki similar to that reported previously for native C receptors (3.Maack T. Suzuki M.

Trypsinization-solubilization experiments in recombinant CHOCRWT cells showed that at equilibrium, 68.4 ± 6.9% or ~two-thirds of the total number receptors expressed in these cells were localized in the cell membrane (n = 5 wells in two independent experiments), a value similar to that found for native C receptors in bovine aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (14.Nussenzveig D.R.

The lysate of nontransfected (CHO-) and recombinant CHO cell clones prelabeled with a mixture of 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody against human kidney C receptor, and their mobility in SDS-PAGE was determined under reducing (+DTT) and nonreducing (-DTT) conditions, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The autoradiogram shows that CHO- cells do not contain detectable C receptors, whereas intense autoradiographic bands are visible in the immunoprecipitated extracts of all recombinant cells. Under nonreducing conditions (-DTT), CHOCRWT and all receptors with cytoplasmic tail mutations (CHOCRCYT-, CHOCR514t, CHOCRA508, CHOCRA538, and CHOCRA508/A538) migrate as a ~120-kDa protein, with a smaller proportion migrating as a ~60-kDa protein. As expected, the truncated mutants (CHOCRCYT- and CHOCR514t) migrate at correspondingly lower molecular masses. Under reducing conditions (+DTT) the ~120-kDa band disappears, and a prominent ~60-kDa band is seen. This confirms that CHOCRWT is constitutively present as a homodimer and that the cytoplasmic tail mutations do not alter the state of polymerization of the receptor. CHOCRA473 receptors, as indicated by the arrows, migrate only as a ~60-kDa protein under reducing and nonreducing conditions, demonstrating that the replacement of cysteine 473 by alanine impedes the constitutive dimerization of C receptors (for a description, see “Results”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2 shows the immunofluorescence signal in nontransfected CHO cells and in CHO cells transfected with wild type or mutated C receptors used in the present experiments. The results show that all recombinant cells, but not nontransfected CHO cells, displayed an intense fluorescence signal. No obvious qualitative differences were observed between the morphological expression of transfected wild type and mutated receptors in the recombinant cells at the resolution of the optical microscope. Fig. 3 shows an SDS-PAGE autoradiogram of extracts from recombinant CHO cells immunoprecipitated with a specific monoclonal antibody against C receptors. In nontransfected cells, immunoprecipitated bands were very faint, if at all present, confirming that CHO-K1 cells do not express a significant density of native C receptors. As expected, under reducing and nonreducing conditions, the truncated forms of recombinant receptors (CHOCRCYT-, and CHOCR514t) migrated at slightly lower molecular weights than CHOCRWT or the point mutated C receptors. Additional bands of unknown nature appeared in CHOCR514t under nonreducing conditions. They are probably an artifact, because under reducing conditions a single high intensity band was detected with this mutant. Under nonreducing conditions the recombinant receptors, except CHOCRA473, migrated as two bands, a high"

The domain is expressed as a disulfide-bonded dimer, as shown by SDS-gel electrophoretic analysis of the immunoprecipitated domain in the presence and absence of reducing agent and the cross-linking agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate. Molecular weight determination by gel filtration on agarose columns in 6 M guanidine HCl confirmed dimer formation. However, the domain expressed is heterogeneous as the result of different extents of glycosylation. Pulse-chase studies with the 35S-labeled domain show that dimer formation and secretion from cells occur very rapidly. Moreover, dimer formation is not dependent on the N-linked oligosaccharides on the domain. Evidence is presented that dimer formation most likely occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum before complex-type oligosaccharide synthesis is completed. Neither brefeldin A nor tunicamycin interferes with the rate of dimer formation. These studies suggest that the disulfide-rich domain acts to form dimers of the polypeptide chain of mucin. This role of the domain is consistent with its amino acid sequence similarity to the disulfide-rich domain of human prepro-von Willebrand factor, which also serves to form dimers of this blood coagulation factor.

This role of the domain is consistent with its amino acid sequence similarity to the disulfide-rich domain of human prepro-von Willebrand factor, which also serves to form dimers of this blood coagulation factor. Porcine submaxillary mucin has a disulfide-rich domain of ~240 residues at its carboxyl terminus(1.Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This domain contains 30 half-cystine residues and no free thiol groups, 1N. Swamy, A. E. Eckhardt, and R. L. Hill, unpublished observations. and unlike the highly O-glycosylated portions of the polypeptide backbone, it appears to be a globular structure. Such disulfide-rich domains are characteristic of many mucins and have been found in a bovine submaxillary gland mucin-like protein(2.Bhargava A.K. Woitach J.T. Davidson E.A. Bhavanandan V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6798-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); human intestinal mucin, designated MUC2(3.Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Rothe E.-M. Lagace R.E.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6240-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Of these mucins, the complete amino acid sequence has been established for only human intestinal mucin. This intestinal mucin contains a single disulfide-rich domain at its carboxyl terminus, which is similar in sequence to each of the three contiguous disulfide-rich domains near its amino terminus(7.Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddicki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is a high degree of identity in the amino acid sequences among the disulfide-rich domains from different mucins, especially in the location of the half-cystines. Moreover, there is a striking sequence identity between the disulfide-rich domains of human intestinal mucin and the four disulfide-rich domains of human prepro-von Willebrand factor(7.Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddicki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the four domains of prepro-von Willebrand factor and human intestinal mucin are located in the same regions of the molecule, one near the carboxyl terminus and three near the amino terminus. Although the sequence identity between the porcine submaxillary gland mucin domain and human prepro-von Willebrand factor is only ~20% (1.Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus of questionable significance statistically, the location of the half-cystines in these domains is very much the same. The disulfide-rich domains of von Willebrand factor have been shown to form interchain disulfide bonds among von Willebrand factor monomers. The disulfide bonds between the carboxyl-terminal domains of von Willebrand factor permit dimer formation(8.Marti T. Rosselet S.J. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8099-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 9.Voorberg J. Fontijn R. Calafat J. Janssen H. van Mourik J.A. Pannekoek H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), whereas those in the amino terminus permit multimer formation(8.Marti T. Rosselet S.J. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8099-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10.Voorberg J. Fontijn R. van Mourik J.A. Pannekoek H.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17361-17367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the structural similarities between von Willebrand factor, human intestinal mucin, and porcine submaxillary mucin, it was of interest to determine whether the mucin domains serve to form dimers or oligomers. Dimer or oligomer formation in mucins would be difficult to determine, however, because mucins have very high molecular weights (>107) and high carbohydrate contents (75-90% carbohydrate by weight) that prevent structural analysis by methods such as gel electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation by sedimentation equilibrium. We report here studies showing that porcine submaxillary mucin can very likely form dimers between its carboxyl-terminal domains. This was determined by expression of the disulfide-rich domain in mammalian cells transfected with cDNA encoding the domain, but devoid of the other structures of mucin that interfere with gel electrophoretic analysis. By these means, it is shown that the disulfide-rich monomer is synthesized and converted rapidly to a disulfide-linked dimer in the endoplasmic reticulum before secretion of the dimer into the medium. The antiserum(3814) specific for the mucin disulfide-rich domain was raised against a carboxyl-terminal polypeptide (residues 907-1150; (1.Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) expressed in Escherichia coli by a glutathione S-transferase fusion expression system. A cDNA PstI/EcoRI fragment encoding the entire domain was obtained from the plasmid pPSM1A (1.Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into a modified pGEX-KT vector. Expression of the latter construct in E. coli DH5α yielded a fusion protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase and the mucin domain, which was purified from crude extracts by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose(12.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5018) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin and absorbed to glutathione-agarose following the procedure of Guan and Dixon(13.Guan L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). The disulfide-rich domain was not adsorbed to the glutathione-agarose from the adsorbent and was used as antigen to produce rabbit antiserum 3814 following standard protocols from our laboratory(1.Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A rabbit antiserum against a peptide from the carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domain of pig submaxillary mucin (residues 1126-1137) was described earlier(1.Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An EcoRI cDNA fragment encoding the entire mucin disulfide-rich domain was subcloned into the SV40-based eukaryotic expression vector pPROTA(14.Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein A and mucin sequences in the new plasmid, pPA-MC1, were put in frame by site-directed mutagenesis according to the method of Deng and Nickoloff (15.Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) using the following mutagenic/selection oligonucleotide: 5′-GGGGATCCTCAGAGTCGACC-3′. The resulting expression vector, pPA-MC2, encodes a fusion protein containing 32 amino acids from the transin signal peptide followed by an IgG-binding domain of protein A (14.Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 10 amino acid residues (SSVPGDPSRP) derived from the multicloning site of pEMBLmp18 (16.Dente L. Cesareni G. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) followed by the mucin domain (residues 907-1150). To construct the expression vectors pMC and pMCH, protein A coding sequences were removed by digestion of pPA-MC1 with Pf1MI and XbaI, and a new multicloning site was created by inserting the following annealed oligonucleotide Pf1MI/XbaI linkers: 5′-ATGGCAGTGAAGAAGGTCGACGAATTCTTT-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAAGAATTCGTCGACCTTCTTCACTGCCATGC-3′. The resulting plasmid was digested with SalI and self-ligated to produce the expression vector pMC. This plasmid encodes a fusion protein containing a transin signal peptide of 25 amino acids, three residues (GRR) derived from the new multicloning site, and the mucin disulfide-rich domain. The expression vector pMCH was constructed by simultaneously digesting pMC with DraIII and SpeI and ligating the resulting open plasmid to a poly-His-encoding cassette made by annealing the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GTGCTCCTGCTTAGATCCGTGCCAACAATCTATGACCCATCACCATCACCATCACTAA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGGTCATAGATTGTTGGCACGGATCTAAGCAGGAGCACGCG-3′. The new plasmid encodes a protein that only differs from the protein encoded by pMC in that it contains six consecutive His residues just before the stop codon. All constructions were characterized by extensive restriction nuclease analysis and partial DNA sequencing by the dideoxy method using the Sequenase Version 2.0 system (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mM glutamine, and 0.1% (w/v) streptomycin/penicillin antibiotics. NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Transfer of DNA into cells was performed by liposome-mediated transfection using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as directed by the manufacturer. COS-7 cells were grown for 48 h post-transfection before use. For stable transfection of NIH-3T3 cells, a 1:20 mixture of pHBAPr1neo (17.Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.-Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and pMC was used. Positive colonies, selected in 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (G418), were pooled and expanded in G418-containing culture medium. All culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells at 90% confluency in 100-mm diameter culture dishes were incubated for 30 min in methionine/cysteine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and then labeled with 100 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). In some experiments, cells were subsequently washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and chased in culture medium containing 0.24 mg/ml cysteine and 0.15 mg/ml methionine. At selected intervals, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 ml of lysis buffer/dish). After centrifugation, the supernatant solutions were treated with preimmune serum (20 μl/ml) and 100 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) and then immunoprecipitated for 18 h at 4°C with antiserum 3814 (20 μl/ml) followed by absorption to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads. Proteins secreted into the medium were immunoprecipitated after addition of concentrated lysis buffer to give a final concentration as above for cell lysates. Alternatively, proteins synthesized by cells transfected with plasmid pPROTA or pPA-MC2 were absorbed to IgG-agarose (Sigma) as described elsewhere (14.Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion proteins containing the carboxyl-terminal poly-His sequence were also purified from the conditioned medium using TALON IMAC resin (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, the conditioned medium was made 50 mM in sodium phosphate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and incubated with TALON beads (1 ml of conditioned medium/20 μl of resin) for 30 min at 22°C. The beads were sequentially washed in the same buffer containing 100 mM NaCl and then 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.0. When used to test their effect on the biosynthesis of the recombinant proteins, tunicamycin and brefeldin A (both from Sigma) were added to the culture medium before and during metabolic labeling at final concentrations of 10 and 5 μg/ml, respectively. Poly-His-containing proteins, absorbed to TALON resin as described above, were eluted with 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium chloride, and 5 mM bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce)(18.Staros J.V. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3950-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). After 30 min at 22°C, the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2 × SDS-gel electrophoresis loading buffer. In other experiments, the conditioned medium was briefly centrifuged, and solid cross-linker was added at a final concentration of 5 mM. After 15 min of incubation at 22°C, sufficient 1 M glycine was added to give a final concentration of 100 mM, and the sample was incubated for another 15 min. Fusion proteins were then immunoprecipitated as described above. Purified recombinant proteins were eluted from their specific absorbents by boiling for 5 min in 50 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 0.5% SDS and 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were then reacted for 16 h at 37°C with 1 unit/ml N-glycanase (Genzyme Corp.) in 0.2 M sodium phosphate, pH 8.3, containing 1.75% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride or with 0.05 unit/ml endoglycosidase H (Genzyme Corp.) in 75 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride(19.Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 557-596Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by mixing with an equal volume of 2 × SDS-gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The proteins were eluted from their specific absorbents by boiling in SDS-gel electrophoresis loading buffer and resolved on discontinuous polyacrylamide gels(20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204784) Google Scholar). A mixture of 14C-labeled proteins (Sigma) were used as molecular weight standards. This mixture includes α-lactalbumin (Mr = 14,200), carbonic anhydrase (29,000), chicken egg albumin (45,000), bovine serum albumin (66,000), β-galactosidase (116,000), and myosin (205,000). Radiolabeled bands were detected by autoradiography after incubation of the gels with Amplify (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's directions. The dried gels were exposed at −70°C to Eastman Kodak BioMax or X-Omat AR films. Recombinant proteins were purified from the medium of radiolabeled COS-7 cells, transfected with pPA-MC2 or pMCH, by absorption to IgG-agarose beads or IMAC resin, respectively. They were eluted with 6 M guanidine HCl, pH 5.0, or with 6 M guanidine HCl in 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.6, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Following overnight incubation at 22°C, the reduced samples were alkylated for 1 h with iodoacetamide and applied to a Sepharose Cl-4B column (1.7 × 83 cm) equilibrated with 6 M guanidine HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted at 20 ml/h. Fractions were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. The column was calibrated with the following protein markers: β-galactosidase (Mr = 116,000; Sigma), phosphorylase b (97,400; Sigma), transferrin (76,000; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), ovalbumin (45,000; Calbiochem), carbonic anhydrase (29,300; a gift from Dr. C. Fierke), and cytochrome c (12,400; Sigma). Native porcine submaxillary mucin (10 mg/ml), prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors as described previously (1.Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was dissolved in 0.01 N HCl, pH 2.0, and digested with 10% (w/w) pepsin (Sigma) at 37°C. After 18 h, the digest was mixed with an equal volume of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 200 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. One of the samples was digested with 5 units/ml N-glycanase as described above. The digest was mixed with 2 volumes of gel electrophoresis buffer and submitted to SDS-gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were electrotransferred at constant voltage to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) in Towbin transfer buffer(21.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44560) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked for 1 h using 5% bovine serum albumin in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated overnight at 4°C in the primary antiserum diluted 1:100 in TBST containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were washed in TBST and incubated for 1 h at 22°C with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:3000 in TBST containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Following extensive washing in TBST, proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (DuPont NEN) according to the manufacturer's directions. Kaleidoscope prestained standards (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular weight standards. Fig. 1A shows the SDS-gel electrophoretic patterns under reducing conditions of the proteins isolated from the medium of COS-7 cells transfected with three different expression plasmids encoding the carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domain of porcine submaxillary mucin. The proteins expressed by two of the plasmids, pMC and pMCH, were essentially alike and showed five different species varying in molecular weight from 33,000 to 47,000. The two plasmids differed from one another by a polynucleotide in pMCH that encoded six histidine residues just before the stop codon. The third plasmid, designated pPA-MC2, which is a fusion protein of the mucin domain and an IgG-binding domain of protein A(14.Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), produced a protein that migrated as a broad band centered at Mr = 85,000. The molecular weight for the protein encoded by pPA-MC2 is higher than that for pMC or pMCH since it contains the protein A sequence that contributes a molecular mass of 45,000 kDa to the fusion protein. The protein species expressed by pMC and pMCH that move farthest on the gel have an Mr of 33,000, which is about that expected (Mr = 30,000) from the known sequence of the carboxyl-terminal domain(1.Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The species with the higher molecular weight values proved to be N-glycosylated as judged by the proteins secreted into the medium of transfected COS cells incubated with tunicamycin, as shown in Fig. 1B. There are four Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequences in the mucin domain; thus, five protein species with different molecular weights could be expected, each differing in the extent of glycosylation. In the presence of tunicamycin, the cells secreted a single species with an Mr of 33,000, which is consistent with the conclusion that the five species differ in the extent of N-glycosylation. When the secreted proteins were isolated from the medium of transfected COS cells and treated with N-glycanase, the major band with an Mr of 33,000 was observed (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the disulfide-rich domain in native mucin contains N-linked oligosaccharides, native mucin was digested with pepsin, and electroblots of the digests were analyzed with antibodies specific for a synthetic peptide unique to the disulfide-rich domain. As shown in Fig. 1D, the antisera reacted with protein species with an Mr of ~41,000 and a broad band centered at Mr = 17,900. Components of the broad band decreased in size after treatment with N-glycanase, indicating that N-linked oligosaccharides are present in the disulfide-rich domain of native mucin. The minor bands at the top of the gels in all panels of Fig. 1 are at the interface between the stacking and running gels. These bands were also observed on gels analyzed with preimmune serum and are of unknown nature. Fig. 2A shows the SDS-gel electrophoretic patterns of the immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled proteins expressed and secreted into the medium of COS-7 cells transfected with the expression plasmid pMC. In the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (lane 1), five bands were observed, as in Fig. 1A, with Mr values of 33,000-47,000. When the proteins from the medium were cross-linked with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate and analyzed on gels in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, a broad band was observed of cross-linked proteins with a molecular weight centered at ~83,000, or about twice that of the proteins in β-mercaptoethanol. The uncrossed-linked species in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol gave a broad band of similar size (lane 3) as the cross-linked species. All gels showed a 35S-labeled band at the interface between the stacking and running gels, but this band was also found with preimmune serum (lanes 4-6). The preimmune serum, however, did not show the other bands. These results are consistent with formation of a disulfide-linked dimer of the disulfide-rich domain. Fig. 2B shows the same type of experiment as in Fig. 2A, except that the expression plasmid pMCH was used to transfect COS cells and the expressed protein was isolated on a TALON IMAC absorbent. The proteins expressed had about the same molecular weights as those in Fig. 2A and clearly show dimers under nonreducing conditions, monomers under reducing conditions, and cross-linked dimers stable to reduction. Fig. 2C shows the SDS-gel electrophoretic patterns of the proteins expressed by COS cells transfected with pPA-MC2, which encodes the fusion protein of the domain and protein A. The major protein on reducing gels is the monomeric species with an Mr of 86,000-90,000, whereas that on nonreducing gels has an Mr of 180,000. Thus, the formation of dimers is not influenced by the non-mucin portion of the fusion protein. Fig. 3 shows the estimated molecular weights for the proteins expressed and secreted from transfected COS cells as judged by gel filtration on Sepharose Cl-4B in the presence of guanidine HCl. These analyses confirmed the molecular weight estimates made from SDS-gel electrophoresis. Thus, the protein expressed by pPA-MC2 under nonreducing conditions had an Mr of 150,000 as compared with an Mr of 82,000 under reducing conditions. Similarly, the protein from COS cells transfected with pMCH had an Mr of 66,000 in the absence of reducing agent and an Mr of 35,000 in the presence of reducing agent. The molecular weight of pPROTA, the protein expressed by the fusion protein vector without the disulfide-rich domain insert, was about the same in the presence and absence of β-mercaptoethanol, which also indicates that dimer formation is not dependent on the non-mucin portion of the fusion protein. Pulse-chase studies of the formation of the dimers with 35S-labeled amino acids were used to judge the rate of dimer formation and the subcellular compartments where formation occurred. Fig. 4A shows the SDS-gel electrophoretic patterns of the proteins from COS-7 cells transfected with pMC when radiolabeled for 10 min and then chased with unlabeled medium over time. The proteins present in the cell lysate had an Mr centered at ~73,000 under nonreducing conditions and an Mr of 33,000-47,000 in the presence of reducing agents. The multiple species of proteins expressed are characteristic of this vector and represent partially N-glycosylated proteins (Fig. 1). Even at 0 min of chase, dimers are the predominant intracellular species, which indicates that dimer formation is an early event in expression of the disulfide-rich domain. Disulfide-linked dimers are not the result of random disulfide bond formation since inclusion of 5 mM iodoacetamide during lysis of the cells did not alter the apparent amount of dimer on the gels (data not shown). Once formed, the dimers are rapidly secreted from the cells. Thus, in the study shown in Fig. 4A, dimers were almost absent from cells after 2 h of chase and appeared almost exclusively in the medium at this time. A major protein band was also observed in Fig. 4A at the interface between the stacking and running gels under nonreducing conditions in both cells and media. This species was also detected with preimmune serum, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2. A much fainter band was observed at this position under reducing conditions. Thus, this high molecular weight species is not thought to be the result of nonspecific aggregation of mucin. As shown in Fig. 4B, the proteins expressed in the cells transfected with pMC were sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion between 0 and 10 min under the conditions of the chase in unlabeled medium. This result suggests that dimer formation occurs before N-linked oligosaccharides are converted to the complex-type oligosaccharides that are endoglycosidase H-resistant. Because the enzymes that catalyze the conversion of endoglycosidase H-sensitive to endoglycosidase H-resistant species exist in the medial/trans-Golgi complex(22.Velasco A. Hendricks L. Moremen K.W. Tulsiani D.R. Touster O. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), dimer formation must occur in the endoplasmic reticulum or the cis-Golgi apparatus. However, the endoplasmic reticulum is the main organelle acting in mucin dimer formation because cells transfected with pMC express dimers of the domain in the presence of brefeldin A (Fig. 5), a drug that disorganizes the Golgi apparatus(23.Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). Moreover, in brefeldin A, the dimers are not secreted into the medium, nor are their N-linked oligosaccharides converted to the complex type. Dimer formation is not specific to expression in COS-7 cells since stable transfectants of 3T3 cells with plasmid pMC also express dimers, as shown in Fig. 6. In the pulse-chase study shown, dimers (Mr = 66,000) were observed in cell lysates between 0 and 10 min of chase, but had disappeared from the cells after 120 min when they were observed in the medium. Fig. 6 also shows the large band at the interface between the stacking and running gels and another band at Mr~ 55,000. These bands also appeared with preimmune serum as in Fig. 2, Fig. 4, and Fig. 5, but are of unknown nature. The observation that tunicamycin (Fig. 1B) does not inhibit the secretion of the disulfide-rich domain from COS-7 cells indicates that the N-linked oligosaccharides are not required for either intracellular trafficking or secretion from the cell. The pulse-chase studies in Fig. 7 show that the N-linked oligosaccharides are also not required for dimer formation. In these studies, transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with tunicamycin and then pulsed for 10 min with 35S-labeled medium and chased with unlabeled medium. The nonglycosylated proteins expressed intracellularly and secreted into the medium were dimers (Mr = 54,000) on nonreducing gels and monomers (Mr = 33,000) on reducing gels. As in Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, the major band on nonreducing gels at the interface between the stacking and running gels was also observed with preimmune serum. The studies reported here show that the disulfide-rich domain at the carboxyl terminus of porcine submaxillary mucin is synthesized rapidly as a dimer in transiently expressed COS-7 cells (Fig. 1) and stably expressed 3T3 cells (Fig. 6) transfected with expression vectors encoding the domain. The domain is expressed as disulfide-bonded dimers as judged by SDS-gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of β-mercaptoethanol and the cross-linking agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Fig. 2). The domain contains four Asn-X-Thr/Ser sequences that are N-glycosylated to different extents during dimer formation (Fig. 1). Although native mucin contains N-linked oligosaccharides in the disulfide-rich domain (Fig. 1D), the oligosaccharides are apparently not involved in dimer formation. The differential glycosylation of the domain observed in COS-7 cells is not necessarily a feature of domain formation and likely reflects the high rate of expression of the domain and overloading the glycosylation capacity of transfected COS cells. Indeed, the dimers formed in stably transfected 3T3 cells (Fig. 6) are more extensively glycosylated than those in COS cells. Although tunicamycin inhibits the oligomerization, maturation, and secretion of rat gastric mucin(24.Dekker J. Strous G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18116-18122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is no evidence for such effects in dimer formation of the expressed disulfide-rich domain. Pulse-chase studies (Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:) indicate that the dimers of the disulfide-rich domain are formed rapidly once protein synthesis commences. Dimer formation most likely occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum since the first dimers detected (Fig. 4B) are susceptible to endoglycosidase H digestion. This result is consistent with the observation that rat gastric mucin (24.Dekker J. Strous G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18116-18122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) oligomers form in the endoplasmic reticulum, where most secretory proteins are folded and assembled into oligomers (reviewed in (25.Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar)). That dimer formation is an early event in the endoplasmic reticulum is consistent with other secreted mucins such as human gastric mucin (26.Klomp L.W.J. van Rens L. Strous G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and human gall bladder mucin(27.Klomp L.W.J. Lely A.J.D. Strous G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, studies on these mucins are difficult to interpret because the high molecular weights of dimers and their precursors are difficult to measure accurately by gel electrophoresis, which is not a problem in the present studies that examine dimer formation of the disulfide-rich domain in the absence of other parts of the mucin polypeptide chain. The molecular weights of the domains determined by gel electrophoresis are inexact because the mobilities of proteins are influenced markedly by the presence or absence of disulfide bonds, covalent cross-links, and N-linked oligosaccharides. However, the estimated values reported here are sufficiently accurate to leave little doubt that the domains are synthesized as disulfide-bonded dimers. Nevertheless, gel filtration in 6 M guanidine HCl was used as an independent method to check the values obtained by gel electrophoresis. The SDS gels used to detect monomers and dimers also showed immunoreactive proteins of high molecular weight accumulating at the interface between the stacking and running gels. The amounts of protein at the interface varied somewhat from one gel to another under nonreducing conditions, and under reducing conditions, the interfacial protein was much reduced or absent. Moreover, the interfacial proteins were also observed when preimmune serum was used to precipitate the expressed proteins from cells or medium. These observations suggest that the interfacial proteins are disulfide-bonded proteins that nonspecifically react with components of rabbit serum, but not with the anti-mucin antibodies. The exact nature of the interfacial protein remains to be determined, but it may be aggregates of the domain that form nonspecifically in cells. Of interest is the fact that no evidence for very high molecular weight protein comparable to the interfacial protein was observed on gel filtration of purified proteins in 6 M guanidine HCl. The carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domain of porcine mucin is marginally identical in its complete amino acid sequence to the carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domain of human prepro-von Willebrand factor(1.Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the half-cystine residues have a high degree of identity. Moreover, the analogous domains from other types of human mucin that show more significant sequence identity to prepro-von Willebrand factor (7.Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddicki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also show statistically significant sequence identity to the porcine disulfide-rich domain. Thus, since dimer formation of von Willebrand factor is the result of disulfide bonding among its carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domains, a similar function for the corresponding domain in mucins is not particularly surprising. Nevertheless, proof of dimer formation in mucins would be very difficult to establish by direct analysis of native mucins because their high carbohydrate contents, and high molecular weights, prevent direct analysis by gel electrophoretic or physicochemical methods for examining proteins in solution. Human prepro-von Willebrand factor and human intestinal mucin (MUC2) (7.Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddicki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have three additional disulfide-rich domains in their amino-terminal regions. These domains act in human prepro-von Willebrand factor to form disulfide-bonded oligomers. Similar domains are present in porcine submaxillary mucin, 2A. E. Eckhardt and R. L. Hill, unpublished observations. but further studies will be necessary to determine whether they serve to form oligomers in mucins."

Filters were washed two times for 10 min each at 56°C in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2) with 5% SDS and 1 mM EDTA and one time for 10 min at 56°C in 0.04 M Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2) with 1% SDS and 1 mM EDTA. Two positive plaques were purified through two additional cycles of screening. These cDNAs were subcloned into the pBluescript ll KS(+) and transfected into DH5-α competent cells. One (P5CDhR2, 1.8 kb) of the inserts was sequenced. To extend the 5′-end of the P5CDh cDNA, we performed a 5′ rapid amplification of the cDNA end (RACE) with 2 μg of human HepG2 poly(A)+ RNA, an antisense primer corresponding to the most 5′-region of the human retinal P5CDh cDNA (5′-CAGGGCAGCCTCAATGGC-3′, primer 3) and a Clontech 5′-AmpliFinder RACE kit. Hybridization, clone isolation and sequencing were performed as described for the human retinal P5CDh cDNA clone. The sequences of the primers used to amplified the 3′-UTR of genomic DNA and cDNAs are listed below. Primer 4 (5′-AGCTACGCGTACATGCAGTG) primer 5 (5′-GGAATGGCCACACCAGCTC) correspond to sequences flanking the insert. Primer 6 (5′-TGTGGGGCACAGGGGGC) and primer 7 (5′-GTGTCACCATGGCACAGT) are at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the insert, respectively. We performed PCR amplification on genomic DNA (100 ng) and both the long and short forms of human P5CDh cDNAs (1 pg) as follows. An initial denaturation step of 4 min at 96°C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 96°C, 1 min at 61°C, and 2 min at 72°C. The amplified fragments were then electrophoresed in 1% agarose. For sequencing, the fragments were excised, gel purified, and sequenced directly with their PCR primers. We sequenced all cDNA clones in both directions. DNA sequences were aligned and compared using the MacVector (Kodak) and the BLAST programs(16.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71436) Google Scholar). We compared the deduced amino acid sequence of the putative full-length human P5CDh cDNA clone to that of S. cerevisiae and E. coli P5CDhs and those of five members of the human aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily with the MegAlign program (DNASTAR). Total and poly(A)+ RNA from human tissue culture cells were isolated as described elsewhere(17.Dougherty K.M. Brandriss M.C. Valle D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 871-875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A multiple tissue Northern blot filter (Clontech) was hybridized under high stringency conditions as suggested in manufacturer's manual. Human β-actin was used to verify RNA quality and quantity. Human genomic DNA was isolated from human lymphocytes according to the method of Kunkel(18.Mitchell G. Brody L. Looney J. Steel G. Suchanek M. Dowling C. Der Kaloustian V. Kaiser-Kupfer M. Valle D. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with EcoRI, BamHI or HindIII separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen plus membrane (DuPont NEN). DNA was cross-linked to the membrane using a UV-autocross linker (Stratagene). Hybridization and autoradiography were performed with the same conditions used for library screening. Chromosome mapping was done by using a PstI-digested monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid mapping panel (Oncor) as described in manufacturer's manual. All hybridizations were with human P5CDhS as the probe. We used the 2-μm based pSM703 E. coli/yeast shuttle vector plasmid containing URA3 and ampR selectable markers and a multiple cloning site downstream of an S. cerevisiae phosphoglycerate kinase promoter and upstream of LacZ sequences (kindly provided by S. Michaelis). We cloned P5CDhS and P5CDhL into the EcoRI site in the sense orientation relative to the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter in pSM703 and designated the two derivative plasmids, pHsP5CDhS1 and pHsP5CDhL1, respectively (Fig. 2). To replace the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter and 5′-UTR of the human P5CDh cDNAs with S. cerevisiae PUT2 5′ sequence, we used a PCR-based cloning strategy to construct pHsP5CDhS2 and pHsP5CDhL2. Briefly, we made use of a NarI site 7 bp downstream of the predicted start ATG to delete the 5′-UTR of the human P5CDh cDNAs. A 3′-antisense primer, primer 8 (5′-CGCGGGCGCCGGCAGCAGCATAATTCCTGTGAATTTG), contains complementary sequences of human P5CDh cDNA at position +1 to +18 (including the NarI site at +10) and yeast PUT2 5′-UTR position −1 to −16. A 5′-primer, primer 9 (5′-CCCAAGCTTGATCCATTAAACTGGAAACAC), introduces a 5′-HindIII cloning site and corresponds to yeast PUT2 promoter sequence bp −435 to −414 relative to the translational start site. After a 30-cycle amplification, we gel-purified the 450-bp product fragment and substituted it for the HindIII-NarI fragment of the plasmids pHsP5CDhS1, pHsP5CDhL1 (see Fig. 2). The nucleotide sequences at the ligation junctions in plasmids pHsP5CDhS2, and pHsP5CDhL2 were confirmed by sequencing. pKB13, a plasmid containing S. cerevisiae PUT2 gene was a gift from M. Brandriss(19.Brandriss M.C. Krzywicki K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3502-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We subcloned the yeast PUT2 gene from pKB13 to pSM703 to form pScPUT2. The parental S. cerevisiae strain used in this study was MB1472 (MATa, ura3-52, trp1, put2::TRP1 (the TRP1 gene replaces codons 15-538 of the PUT2 gene)) (a gift from M. Brandriss). To make additional strains we transformed (20.Shani N. Watkins P.A. Valle D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6012-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) MB1472 with vector (pSM703) alone (strain HV1) or with recombinant pSM703 constructs expressing pScPUT2, pHsP5CDhS2, pHsP5CDhL2, pHsP5CDhS1, or pHsP5CDhL1 to create strains HV2-6, respectively. The transformation mixtures were plated on minimal glucose medium containing 1% proline without uracil (MGP-ura−) or minimal glucose medium containing 0.1% ammonium sulfate without uracil (MGA-ura−)(17.Dougherty K.M. Brandriss M.C. Valle D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 871-875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were grown for 10 days at 30°C. Total DNA was isolated from yeast transformants and used to transform E. coli 294 competent cells(21.Strathern J.N. Higgins D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin serving as a standard. P5CDh activity was assayed radioisotopically (11.Valle D. Goodman S.I. Applegarth D.A. Shih V.E. Phang J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in soluble extracts of saturated overnight cultures of MB1472 grown in medium MGA-ura+, HV1 grown in MGA-ura− medium, and HV2, HV3, and HV4 grown in MGP-ura− medium, were harvested, flash frozen, and disrupted in liquid N2. We selected two human P5CDh peptide sequences corresponding to conserved regions of human and yeast proteins to design degenerate PCR primers (Fig. 1). Amplifying with primer 1 and 2 we obtained the expected ~ 240-bp product. The deduced amino acid sequence of the amplified fragment (P5CDhP-1) had 53% identity to the corresponding region of yeast P5CDh and contained perfect (15/15) matches for the human peptides (II and III) predicted to be included (Fig. 1). We used P5CDhP-1 to isolate putative human P5CDh cDNAs from human retinal, muscle and kidney cDNA libraries. The 5′ end of one cDNA clone (P5CDhM19) extended into the 5′ untranslated region to bp −6 (where +1 is the A of the initiation methionine codon). 5′-RACE with HepG2 cDNA identified a 300-bp fragment (P5CDhR1) that had a 286-bp overlap with the 5′-end of P5CDhM19 and extended an additional 24 bp 5′-ward to −30. Of the cDNAs that extended to the poly(A) tail, two had a 3′-UTR of 1415 bp and one had a 3′-UTR of 404 bp. We constructed two composite P5CDh cDNA clones (Fig. 2): one, designated P5CDhS, was 2123 bp and included 30 bp of a 5′-untranslated sequence, an 1689-bp open reading frame, and 404 bp of 3′-UTR extending to the poly(A) tail; the second, designated P5CDhL, was identical to P5CDhS except for a 1011-bp insert in the 3′-UTR at bp +1733 of P5CDhS. The open reading frame of these clones encodes a 563-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kDa. The overall amino acid sequence of the putative human P5CDh has a 42 and 26% identity to those of S. cerevisiae and E. coli, respectively (Fig. 1). The predicted active site residues (Glu314 and Cys348) are completely conserved among these three proteins as well as five other members of the ALDh family (Fig. 3A)(2.Hempel J. Nicholas H. Lindahl R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1890-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6.Ling M. Allen S.W. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A region corresponding to a possible NAD+-binding motif is also highly conserved (Fig. 3B). There are three potential N-glycosylation sites (consensus = N-X-(S/T)) located at Asn193, Asn211, and Asn283 of the unprocessed P5CDh protein (Fig. 1)(22.Lis H. Sharon N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 23.Oikawa S. Nakazato H. Kosaki G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 24.Baenziger J.U. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As expected for a mitochondrial matrix protein, the N terminus of the putative P5CDh has no acidic residues and several arginine, leucine, and serine residues(25.Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 26.von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Hendrick et al.(25.Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) suggested that a fair predictor of the cleavage site is the sequence R-X-(Φ)-X-X-(S)- where the R is located at −10 relative to the cleavage site and Φ = a hydrophobic residue, usually F, V, L, or I. Additionally, an R is often present at −2 relative to the cleavage site. With these considerations, there are two possible mitochondrial leader cleavage sites in the conceptual translation of P5CDh (indicated by the vertical arrowheads in Fig. 1). The more N-terminal site has an R at −10, a W at −8, an A at −5, and an R at −2; the more distal site has an R at −10, a K at −8, an S at −5, and a K at −2. We favor the more N-terminal site which would predict a leader sequence of 24 residues containing 4 R, 6 L, and 1 S residues and would yield a processed P5CDh of 539 amino acids. Northern blot analysis of mRNA isolated from multiple human tissues showed one predominant transcript of about 3.2 kb (Fig. 4A). Liver had the highest expression followed by skeletal muscle, kidney, heart, brain, placenta, lung, and pancreas. Interestingly, we did not detect P5CDh transcripts corresponding to the P5CDhS (predicted length 2.2 kb), indicating that the predominant transcript in the tissues examined corresponds to the P5CDhL cDNA. Comparison of the 3′-UTR sequences of P5CDhL and P5CDhS showed that they differ only by a 1011-bp insert in the long form following bp 1733 of P5CDhS. The sequence of the insert is GC-rich (67% G + C) and has features of an intron with 5′ (AG gtggcc …) and 3′ (… cgattcctcccacag AT) ends (lower case) consistent with consensus splice sites (5′ = AG gtaagt …; 3′ = (Y)nncag G …). Additionally, there is a potential branch point sequence (… ctcac …; consensus … ctray …) located so that the a is an acceptable distance (55 bp) 5′ of the 3′-splice site(27.Cooper D.N. Krawszak M. Antonarakis S.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 259-291Google Scholar). To determine if the structure of the genomic sequence encoding P5CDh matches the 3′-end of the P5CDhL cDNA, we compared the products of PCR amplification of genomic DNA and cDNA using primers flanking and/or at the ends of the insert. We found that when amplifying with either genomic DNA or P5CDhL cDNA as template and primer pairs 4 + 5, 4 + 7, 6 + 5, and 6 + 7, we detected 1,242-, 881-, 776-, and 415-bp product fragments, respectively, on both lanes (Fig. 5, lanes G and L). We detected only a 233-bp product fragment when using P5CDhS cDNA as template and primer pair 4 + 5 (Fig. 5, lane S). These results indicate that the 3′-UTR sequence of P5CDhL is colinear with genomic DNA and that the 1011-bp sequence is spliced out in P5CDhS. To estimate the size and complexity of the human P5CDh structural gene, we hybridized Southern blots of human genomic DNA with radiolabeled P5CDhS. The probe detects genomic DNA fragments totaling ~ 20 kb in size suggesting the P5CDh structural gene is single copy and relatively simple (Fig. 4B). Using a monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid mapping panel and radiolabeled P5CDhS as probe, we mapped the human P5CDh structural gene to human chromosome 1 (Fig. 4C). To confirm the predicted function of our P5CDh cDNAs, we constructed several yeast/human P5CDh hybrid minigenes (Fig. 2) for expression in S. cerevisiae strain MB1472, a proline utilization (PUT) mutant with a partially deleted P5CDh gene (put2). MB1472 is unable to utilize proline as a sole nitrogen source and does not revert to PUT+ phenotype. Transformants were selected on MGP-ura− or MGA-ura− and further tested for the coordinate appearance of URA+ and PUT+ phenotypes. For each transformation, three plasmids were isolated and shuttled into E. coli 294 cells. The plasmids were isolated from the 294 cell transformants, characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing and used to retransform MB1472 selecting on MGP-ura−. In all cases, these plasmid-dependent, PUT+ transformants were also found to be URA+ indicating that the cDNA carried by the plasmid was responsible for rescue of the proline utilization phenotype. Initially, in these experiments we used the pHsP5CDhS1 and pHsP5CDhL1 plasmids which contain the entire human P5CDh cDNAs including its 30-bp 5′-UTR downstream from the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. However, no growth was detected when we transferred transformants to the selective MGP-ura− medium (data not shown). We reasoned that this failure to complement might be the result of reduced translational efficiency due to the presence of the human 5′-UTR(28.Hinnebusch A.G. Liebman S.W. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis and Energetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 627-735Google Scholar). Accordingly, we reengineered the human P5CDh cDNA clones, replacing the human P5CDh 5′-UTR with that of S. cerevisiae PUT2 under the control of the PUT2 promoter and leaving the entire human P5CDh reading frame unchanged (plasmids pHsP5CDhS2 and pHsP5CDhL2). These recombinant cDNAs did restore the PUT+ growth phenotype in MB1472 transformants. The yeast P5CDh gene (PUT2) did complement more efficiently than the human: MB1472 cells transformed with the PUT2 gene (strain HV2), grew on MGP-ura− after 3-5 days; while MB1472 harboring pHsP5CDhS2 or pHsP5CDhL2 (strain HV3 or HV4, respectively), required 7-10 days of incubation on MGP-ura− for equivalent growth (Fig. 6). To confirm that the complementing activity in strains HV2, HV3, and HV4 was due to the expression of a functional P5CDh, we assayed the activity of this enzyme in extracts of these cells. Substantial P5CDh activity was detectable in HV2, 4.4 nmol of product/h/mg (4.2-4.6) (mean (range)); HV3, 4.2 (4.0- 4.4); and HV4, 2.9 (2.6-3.5). No activity was detected in yeast transformed with vector alone (strain HV1). We concluded that the protein encoded by pHsP5CDhS2 or pHsP5CDhL2 is human P5CDh and that the human enzyme is able to function in the heterologous yeast system. Using published peptide sequences and degenerate primer PCR, we isolated two types of cDNAs encoding human P5CDh. Both encode the identical 563 amino acid protein but differ in their 3′-UTR with one containing a 1011 bp insert. The protein predicted by conceptual translation of these cDNAs has excellent agreement with the P5CDh peptide sequences published by Hempel et al.(4.Hempel J. Eckey R. Berie D. Romovacek H. Agarwal D.P. Goedde H.W. Comp. Bochem. Physiol. 1992; 102B: 791-793Google Scholar); all the peptides are recognizable with an overall identity of 89% (93/105 residues) with 7 of the 12 mismatched residues located at the C termini of three peptides. As expected for a protein found in the mitochondrial matrix, the N-terminal region of human P5CDh has features characteristic of a mitochondrial targeting sequence. The most likely cleavage site yields a leader of 24 amino acids and a mature P5CDh of 539 amino acids with a molecular mass of 59 kDa which is in excellent agreement with published values for human and rat P5CDh(3.Forte-McRobbie C.M. Pietruszko R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2154-2163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Agarwal D.P. Eckey R. Hempel J. Goedde H.W. Weiner H. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism 4. Plenum Press, New York1993: 191-197Google Scholar, 29.Small W.C. Jones M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18668-18672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression studies in yeast mutants lacking P5CDh activity confirm that the encoded protein is human P5CDh. Human P5CDh has significant sequence similarity to the orthologous protein of lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes (26-42% identity) as well as to other aldehyde dehydrogenases confirming that it is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. The functional significance of the highly conserved residues common to these proteins, in particular the putative active site residues and NAD+-binding motifs, will require additional studies with site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays. The human P5CDh structural gene is located on chromosome 1, at least 20 kb in size and appears to be a single copy with a relatively simple structure as indicated by the low number of hybridizing fragments detected in genomic Southern blot analysis. Several lines of evidence indicate that the 1-kb insert in P5CDh is an alternatively spliced intron. First, the insert sequence has consensus sequences for donor, branch point and acceptor splice sites at 5′- and 3′-termini, respectively. Second, we found that human P5CDh cDNA is colinear with genomic DNA over the area containing the insert (Fig. 5). We found cDNAs encoding both the long and short forms in kidney and retinal cDNA libraries and we were able to detect both the long and short forms by reverse transcription and PCR amplification of HepG2 cell RNA (data not shown). However, our Northern blot data show that the transcript containing the insert is the predominant P5CDh mRNA (>95%) in all tissues examined. These results suggest that either this 3′-UTR intron is not removed from most transcripts or that its presence enhances mRNA stability so that the long transcripts preferentially accumulate. The 5′-splice site (AG gtggcc …) is not ideal particularly at the −4 to −6 positions with a “consensus value” of 0.66 where the value for typical introns ranges from 0.7-1.0 with a mean of 0.83(27.Cooper D.N. Krawszak M. Antonarakis S.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed.

Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 100-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This suggests that this intron is a poor substrate for splicing. Nevertheless, additional studies of transcript splicing and stability will be required to discriminate between these two possibilities. Other human cDNAs with alternatively spliced introns in the 3′-UTR have been described (32.Kraus J.P. Le K. Swaroop M. Ohura T. Tahara T. Rosenberg L.E. Roper M.D. Kozich V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Yeast systems have proven valuable for the study of human genes, particularly those encoding enzymes(33.Tugendreich S.

A. 1994; 91: 6614-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have all been shown to complement the growth phenotype of the relevant mutant strain. Our results show that expression of chimeric P5CDh cDNAs comprised of the 5′-UTR of the yeast PUT2 gene and the human open reading frame of P5CDh clearly complement the growth phenotype of put2 yeast and express P5CDh activity in the range observed for human fibroblasts(11.Valle D. Goodman S.I. Applegarth D.A. Shih V.E. Phang J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The failure to obtain this result with the complete human cDNAs may be explained by differences in the 5′-UTR of the two species. The PUT2 transcript has a typical S. cerevisiae 5′-UTR with an abundance of A nucleotides (47%), a scarcity of G nucleotides (11%) and an A in the −3 position relative to the ATG codon(28.Hinnebusch A.G. Liebman S.W. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis and Energetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 627-735Google Scholar). By contrast, the 30-nucleotide 5′-UTR encoded by our human P5CDh cDNAs has 23% A, 20% G, and a G at the −3 position. A similar benefit of substituting a yeast 5′-UTR to obtain maximal expression of a human cDNA has been observed by others(37.Nigro J.M. Sikorski R. Reed S.I. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies suggest that P5CDh mutations are responsible for HP II, an inborn error of proline catabolism(1.Phang J.M. Yeh G.C. Scriver C.R. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw Hill, New York1995: 1125-1146Google Scholar). Availability of the human P5CDh cDNAs described in this work will allow us to determine the molecular basis of this disorder. Furthermore, the ability to complement yeast strain MB1472 (put2) lacking P5CDh activity with the human P5CDh cDNA clones will provide an assay system to examine the functional consequences of mutations in human P5CDh.

The trp gene encodes a Ca2+-permeable channel that is activated by thapsigargin, blocked by low micromolar Gd3+, and is relatively selective for Ca2+versus Na+ and Ba2+. In contrast, trpl encodes a Ca2+-permeable cation channel that is constitutively active, not affected by thapsigargin, blocked by high micromolar Gd3+, and non-selective with respect to Ca2+, Na+, and Ba2+. The region of lowest sequence identity between Trp and Trpl occurs in the COOH-terminal domain. To test the hypothesis that this region is responsible for the differential sensitivity of these channels to thapsigargin, chimeric constructs of Trp and Trpl were created in which the COOH-terminal tail region of each protein was exchanged. The Trp construct with the Trpl COOH-tail was constitutively active, insensitive to thapsigargin, but retained selectivity for Ca2+ over Na+ and Ba2+. In contrast, the Trpl construct with the Trp COOH-tail was not constitutively active, could be activated by thapsigargin, but remained non-selective with respect to Ca2+, Ba2+, and Na+.

A synthetic peptide corresponding to the Rab4 hypervariable carboxyl-terminal domain, Rab4-(191-210), was successfully transferred into rat adipocytes by electroporation and inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport by about 50% without affecting the basal transport activity. In contrast, synthetic peptides corresponding to the Rab3C and Rab3D carboxyl-terminal hypervariable domain had little effect on insulin action on glucose transport. The Rab4-(191-210) peptide also reduced insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the Rab4-(191-210) peptide reduced both insulin-induced glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation in the presence of a major histocompatibility complex class I antigen-derived peptide, Dk-(62-85), which is a potent inhibitor of GLUT4 internalization, suggesting that the peptide inhibited exocytotic recruitment of GLUT4-containing vesicles. The Rab4-(191-210) peptide also inhibited GTPγS-stimulated glucose transport. In addition, insulin-stimulated glucose transport was inhibited by the addition of anti-Rab4 antibody. These results suggest that Rab4 protein plays a crucial role in insulin action on GLUT4 translocation, especially in exocytotic recruitment by the hormone of the glucose transporter to the plasma membrane from the intracellular retention pool.

Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in skeletal/cardiac muscles and adipocytes by promotion of translocation of glucose transporter isoform, GLUT4, from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (1.Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 2.Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 3.James D.E.

Although the precise mechanism(s) of insulin-induced GLUT4 redistribution is still unclear, several lines of evidence indicate that GTP-binding protein(s) is involved in the insulin action. Thus, nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues induce GLUT4 translocation (4.Baldini G. Hohman R. Charron M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4037-4040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J.

Furthermore, by dissecting the recycling pathway of GLUT4 into exocytosis and endocytosis, we have demonstrated recently that GTPγS 1The abbreviation used is: GTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotrisphosphate). stimulates exocytotic fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles, whereas the nucleotide inhibits endocytosis of the glucose transporter(8.Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our previous study also indicated that the number of GLUT4 molecules in recycling pool is not large in the basal state and the rate-limiting step of insulin-induced redistribution of GLUT4 is the exocytotic recruitment from the intracellular retention pool to the plasma membrane(8.Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotrisphosphate). The Rab family proteins of Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins have been implicated in regulation of intracellular vesicular traffic(9.Novick P. Brennwald P. Cell. 1993; 75: 597-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Given that exocytotic movement of vesicles is regulated by the Rab family protein(s), GTPγS may promote exocytosis of GLUT4-containing vesicles by stimulation of the Rab protein(s) associated with the vesicles, although other candidates (e.g. trimeric GTP-binding proteins) cannot be ruled out. In this regard, Baldini et al.(10.Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) reported that Rab3D is predominantly expressed in adipocytes and is induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. However, it remains to be demonstrated whether Rab3D is associated with the GLUT4-containing vesicles(11.Baldini G. Scherer P.E. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4284-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Cormont et al.(12.Cormont M. Tanti J.-F. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghen E. Tavitian A. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recently revealed that Rab4 is associated with GLUT4-containing vesicles in rat adipocytes and insulin stimulation resulted in redistribution of the protein from the vesicle to the cytosol. In contrast, Uphues et al.(13.Uphues I. Kolter T. Goud B. Eckel J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that Rab4A was barely detectable in GLUT4-containing vesicles in rat cardiac muscle, although insulin induced an extensive shift of Rab4A from the cytosol and the microsomal fraction to the plasma membrane. In order to investigate whether Rab4 plays an essential role in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation, we incorporated a synthetic peptide corresponding to the Rab4 hypervariable carboxyl-terminal domain into rat adipocytes and examined its effect on the insulin action. The carboxyl-terminal domain of Rab family proteins is thought to be responsible for targetting the proteins to the appropriate subcellular membranes (14.Chavrier P. Gorvel J.-P. Stelzer E. Simons K. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. Nature. 1991; 353: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and to interact with the guanosine diphosphate dissociation inhibitor(15.Stenmark H. Valencia A. Martinez O. Ullrich O. Goud B. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Perez et al.(16.Perez F. Lledo P.-M. Karagogeos D. Vincent J.-D. Prochiants A. Ayala J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1278-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported that synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal domains of Rab3B and Rab3C blocked calcium-triggered prolactin release from anterior pituitary cells. Our study shows that the insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation was markedly inhibited by incorporation of the Rab4 carboxyl-terminal domain peptide, suggesting that Rab4 protein plays a crucial role in the insulin-stimulated glucose transport in rat adipocytes. GTPγS was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. 125I-Labeled protein A was from DuPont NEN. The Rab4-(191-210) peptide (DAALRQLRSPRRTQAPSAQE), Rab3C-(196-215) peptide (ITAAKQNTRLKETPPPPHPN), and Rab3D-(197-216) peptide (PGSNGKGPALGDTPPPQPSS), derived from the carboxyl-terminal domains of rat Rab4(17.Zahraoui A. Touchot N. Chardin P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1204-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), bovine Rab3C(18.Matsui Y. Kikuchi A. Kondo J. Hishida T. Teranishi Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11071-11074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse Rab3D(10.Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), respectively, were synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography to 85-95% homogeniety. Polyclonal antibodies against rat Rab4 were raised in this laboratory by immunizing a guinea pig with peptide (C)QLRSPRRTQAPSAQE conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanine. When immunoblot was performed using total homogenate of rat adipocytes, a single band with a molecular size of 25 kDa was recognized with the anti-Rab4 antibodies. The Dk-(62-85)peptide (RETQIAKGNEQSFRVDLRTLLRYY), derived from the α1 domain of the murine major histocompatibility complex class I antigen (H-2Dk), was synthesized in this laboratory as described previously(8.Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Peptide was dissolved to a concentration of 1.0 mM in 0.1 M NaCl and activated by incubation at 37°C overnight prior to the addition to cells. Isolated adipocytes were prepared by the collagenase method from epididymal adipose tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats (from Charles River, approximately 170-200 g) (19.Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, isolated cells were suspended in Buffer A (25 mM Krebs-Henseleit Hepes buffer supplemented with 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Fraction V) and 3 mM pyruvate, pH 7.4). The isolated cells were washed and resuspended in high K+/low Ca2+ buffer designated as Buffer X (118.0 mM KCl, 4.74 mM NaCl, 0.38 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM EGTA, 1.18 mM MgSO4, 1.18 mM KH2PO4, 23.4 mM Hepes/KOH, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mM pyruvate, pH 7.4) (20.Shibata H. Robinson F.W. Benzing C.F. Kono T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Then, a 0.6-ml aliquot of the cell suspension was mixed with 0.15 ml of Rab4-(191-210) peptide or anti-Rab4 IgG solution, and the electroporation was carried out two times in a Gene-Pulser (from Bio-Rad) set at 25 microfarads and 2.5 kV/cm. The cellular glucose transport activity was estimated by measuring the rate of 0.1 mM 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake by the oil flotation method as described previously(20.Shibata H. Robinson F.W. Benzing C.F. Kono T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane and slowly sedimenting fractions, both enriched with glucose transporter, were prepared by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described by Kono et al.(21.Kono T. Robinson F.W. Blevins T.L. Ezaki O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10942-10947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The slowly sedimenting fraction (22.Shibata Y. Flanagan J.E. Smith M.M. Robinson F.W. Kono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 902: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was identical to what had previously been referred to as either the Golgi-rich fraction or the low density microsomal fraction. Briefly, the cells were washed and homogenized in STE buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris/HCl, 1 mM EDTA/Na, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged for 2 min at 3,000 × g. The pellet (P-1) and the fat fraction were discarded, and the infranatant solution (S-1) was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant (S-2) was further centrifuged as described below, and the pellet (P-2) was suspended in 0.5 ml of STE buffer and layered on top of a linear (15-32.5%, w/w) sucrose density gradient (approximately 1.4 × 8.5 cm in size) and centrifuged for 40 min at 160,000 × g; the sucrose solution was supplemented with 1 mM EDTA/Na and buffered with 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5). After the centrifugation, the plasma membrane fraction (1-3.5 cm from the bottom of the tube) was collected and kept in ice. The 20,000 × g supernatant (S-2) was centrifuged for 30 min at 23,700 × g, and the resulting supernatant (S-3) was saved as the slowly sedimenting fraction. Both the plasma membrane and slow sedimenting fractions were pelleted by centrifugation for 60 min at 150,000 × g. Polyclonal antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal region of GLUT4 were raised in this laboratory by immunizing a rabbit with peptide, (C)KPSTELEYLGPDEND, conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanine. Immunodetection of the GLUT4 glucose transporter isoform was carried out as described previously(23.Saltis J. Habberfield A.D. Egan J.J. Londos C. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins in the plasma membrane and slowly sedimenting fractions were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (43.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (from Millipore) at 120 mA for 4 h. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked with solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), and 154 mM NaCl for 1 h at room temperature. The blocked membrane was incubated in rabbit anti-GLUT4 serum (1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4°C. The membrane was washed and incubated with 125I-protein A (0.2 μCi/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Following extensive washes, the membrane was subjected to autoradiography using Kodak XAR film and intensifying screens. The relative amounts of GLUT4 were quantified by using FUJIX BAS2000 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical analysis was done by Student's t test. All the results reported herein were confirmed by repeating the experiments with different batches of adipocytes on different occasions. In the present study, we first examined whether a sufficient amount of the Rab4-(191-210) peptide could be transferred into rat adipocytes by electroporation and whether transferred peptides had any effect on insulin action on glucose transport. As shown in Fig. 1, neither the basal nor the insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was affected by the Rab4-(191-210) peptides in intact cells, whereas the insulin effect was reduced by about 50% in cells electroporated in the presence of the peptide. The extent of inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport by the peptide varied from 30 to 90% (data not shown) probably because the efficiency of transfer of the peptide by electroporation was not consistent among the batches of cells. These results indicate that the Rab4-(191-210) peptides were successfully transferred into the cells by electroporation and inhibited insulin action on glucose transport. As presented in Fig. 2, the Rab4-(191-210) peptide inhibited the insulin-stimulated glucose transport in a dose-dependent manner without affecting the basal transport activity. In contrast, a synthetic peptide of the Rab3C carboxyl-terminal domain, which was shown to inhibit prolactin release in anterior pituitary cells(16.Perez F. Lledo P.-M. Karagogeos D. Vincent J.-D. Prochiants A. Ayala J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1278-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), had little effect on the insulin-induced glucose transport. Similarly, a synthetic peptide of the Rab3D carboxyl-terminal domain did not affect the insulin-induced glucose transport (data not shown). These results suggest that the insulin action was specifically inhibited by the Rab4 carboxyl-terminal domain peptide. We also investigated the effect of the Rab4-(191-210) peptide on GLUT4 translocation induced by insulin. The results of immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3) showed that insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 was prevented by about 40% in the peptide-incorporated cells, indicating that the Rab4-(191-210) peptide inhibited the insulin action on glucose transport by attenuating GLUT4 translocation from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane. These results also provide evidence that Rab4 protein plays an essential role in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. In the next set of experiments, we studied the effect of the Rab4-(191-210) peptide on insulin-stimulated glucose transport in the presence of the major histocompatibility complex class I antigen-derived peptide, Dk-(62-85), which is a potent inhibitor of endocytosis of GLUT4(24.Stagsted J. Olsson L. Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. Satoh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22809-22813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As we reported previously(8.Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), under these conditions, exclusively exocytotic accumulation of GLUT4 on the plasma membrane could be measured. As illustrated in Fig. 4, Rab4-(191-210) peptide inhibited insulin-induced glucose transport by about 40% in the presence of 50 μMDk-(62-85) without affecting the basal transport activity. Likewise, GLUT4 translocation by insulin in the presence of Dk-(62-85) was significantly inhibited by the Rab4-(191-210) peptide (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the Rab4-(191-210) peptide inhibited exocytotic recruitment by insulin of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane from the intracellular pool.Figure 5:Inhibition by Rab4-(191-210) peptide of the insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in the presence of Dk-(62-85) peptide. Adipocytes in Buffer X were incubated for 60 min at 37°C to stabilize the basal transport activity and then electroporated in the absence or the presence of 0.4 mM Rab4-(191-210) peptide. The cells were then incubated for 30 min in the presence of 50 μMDk-(62-85) with or without 100 nM insulin. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed, homogenized, and subjected to subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, representative immunoblot data. PM, plasma membrane fractions; SS, slowly sedimenting fractions. B, relative amounts of GLUT4. The relative intensities of GLUT4 bands were quantified by using FUJIX BAS2000 bio-imaging analyzer.

Furthermore, by dissecting the recycling pathway of GLUT4 into exocytosis and endocytosis, we have demonstrated that GTPγS promotes exocytotic fusion of the GLUT4-containing vesicles(8.Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These observations led us to investigate whether the Rab4-(191-210) peptide inhibits the GTPγS-stimulated glucose transport. As presented in Fig. 6, the glucose transport activity stimulated by 1 mMGTPγS was reduced by about 40% in the cells electroporated with the Rab4-(191-210) peptide but not with the Rab3C-(196-215) peptides. In the final set of experiments, we examined the effect of anti-Rab4 antibodies on insulin-induced glucose transport activity. A number of studies have demonstrated that electroporation can be employed to introduce antibodies into mammalian cells without affecting the physiological integrity of the cells(25.Chakrabarti R.

As shown in Fig. 7, in adipocytes electroporated in the presence of anti-Rab4 IgG, insulin effect on glucose transport was markedly attenuated. In contrast, nonimmune IgG did not show any inhibitory effect on insulin-induced glucose transport. The anti-Rab4 IgG was ineffective on the insulin action in intact cells (data not shown). These results provide further evidence for the forementioned notion that Rab4 protein plays an essential role in the insulin action on glucose transport. The Rab4 is a member of the Rab family of Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins and has been found to be associated with early endosomes in Chinese hamster ovary cells (29.Vander Sluijs P. Hull M. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Goud B. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6313-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or HepG2 cells(30.Klumperman J. Hille A. Veenendaal T. Oorschot V. Stoorvogel W. VonFigura K. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 997-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Functionally, Rab4 has been shown to control recycling of transferrin receptor from the early endosome to the cell surface(31.Vander Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Cormont et al.(12.Cormont M. Tanti J.-F. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghen E. Tavitian A. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently revealed that Rab4 is present in the GLUT4-containing vesicles in rat adipocytes, and insulin stimulation resulted in redistribution of the protein from the vesicles to the cytosol. They also reported that Rab4 is phosphorylated by the insulin-stimulated MAP kinase (32.Cormont M. Tanti J.-F. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghen E. LeMarchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and argued that the insulin-induced redistribution of Rab4 from the GLUT4-containing vesicles to the cytosol could result from Rab4 phosphorylation by the kinase. Although the significance of Rab4 phosphorylation and redistribution in the insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is yet to be clarified, the presence of Rab4 in the GLUT4-containing vesicles implies the endosomal origin of the vesicles and raises the possibility that Rab4 may play an essential role in the insulin action. In the present study, to investigate the physiological significance of Rab4 protein in the insulin action on glucose transport, we incorporated a synthetic peptide corresponding to the hypervariable carboxyl-terminal domain of Rab4 into rat adipocytes. The carboxyl-terminal domain of Rab family proteins is highly divergent (33.Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and contains structural elements necessary for the association of the proteins with specific target membranes(14.Chavrier P. Gorvel J.-P. Stelzer E. Simons K. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. Nature. 1991; 353: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal domain of Rab3B and Rab3C have been shown to block calcium-triggered prolactin release from pituitary cells(16.Perez F. Lledo P.-M. Karagogeos D. Vincent J.-D. Prochiants A. Ayala J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1278-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the Rab4-(191-210) peptide was successfully transferred into rat adipocytes by electroporation and inhibited insulin action on glucose transport. Immunoblot analysis indicated that the peptide significantly attenuated the insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3). The inhibitory effects were specific to Rab4 because synthetic peptides of the Rab3C and Rab3D carboxyl-terminal domain were without effect. Importantly, the inhibition by the peptide was also observed in the presence of a major histocompatibility complex class I antigen-derived peptide, Dk-(62-85), a potent inhibitor of GLUT4 endocytosis (24.Stagsted J. Olsson L. Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. Satoh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22809-22813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 4:, Figure 5:). As we reported previously(8.Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), in the presence of a sufficient concentration of Dk-(62-85), the endocytosis of GLUT4 is almost completely inhibited; consequently recycling of the glucose transporter from the early endosomes to the plasma membrane does not take place, and exclusively exocytotic recruitment of GLUT4 onto the plasma membrane from the intracellular retention pool, which may be a rate-limiting step for GLUT4 translocation by insulin, can be measured. Although we cannot totally rule out the possibility that Rab4 may be involved in the internalization step of GLUT4 molecules, the present results indicate that one of the steps affected by the Rab4-(191-210) peptide is the insulin-induced exocytotic recruitment from the intracellular retention pool to the plasma membrane and that Rab4 is involved in this crucial step for the hormonal action. However, it is also possible that insulin may activate a step(s) other than the Rab4-regulated one and Rab4 protein may play a more passive role, just like VAMP (38.Cain C.C. Trimble W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11681-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or cellubrevin(39.Volchuk A. Sargeant R. Sumitani S. Liu Z. He L. Klip A. J. Biol.

In the model, GLUT4 molecules are associated with at least two intracellular compartments. One is the early endosome in which GLUT4 molecules seem to appear only in the presence of insulin, and the second one is a more specialized compartment where GLUT4 molecules are sequestrated in the basal state. It is possible that GLUT4 moves to the plasma membrane from either compartment. The results of present study that the extent of inhibiton by the peptide of the insulin effect is somewhat modest in the range of 40-50% may indicate that the Rab4-(191-210) peptide may be involved in only one pathway. In either way, our study provides evidence that Rab4 protein is indispensable for the insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. At present, the mechanism of the inhibition by the Rab4-(191-210) peptide is not clear. Because the carboxyl-terminal domain of Rab proteins contains structural elements necessary for the association with specific target membranes(14.Chavrier P. Gorvel J.-P. Stelzer E. Simons K. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. Nature. 1991; 353: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), the Rab4-(191-210) peptide probably competes with endogenous Rab4 at the target site(s). In agreement with the study by Perez et al.(16.Perez F. Lledo P.-M. Karagogeos D. Vincent J.-D. Prochiants A. Ayala J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1278-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the absence in Rab4-(191-210) peptide of two cysteine residues necessary for geranylgeranylation (34.Magee T. Newman C. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 318-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) seems to exclude Rab-guanosine diphosphate dissociation inhibitor as one of the target molecule because Rab-guanosine diphosphate dissociation inhibitor only associates with geranylgeranylated Rab protein(35.Araki S. Kikuchi A. Hata Y. Isomura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13007-13015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are clearly needed to identify the target molecules of the Rab4-(191-210) peptide. Rab4 has been shown to control recycling of transferrin receptor from the early endosome to the cell surface(31.Vander Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing a mutant Rab4, transferrin receptor remains intracellular(31.Vander Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These observations raise a possibility that the inhibition by the Rab4-(191-210) peptide of the insulin action may result from the reduction of the insulin receptor number on the cell surface. However, reduction of the receptor number may not account for the inhibition of glucose transport by the peptide, because the Rab4-(191-210) peptide also inhibited the glucose transport stimulated by GTPγS (Fig. 6). The effect of GTPγS on exocytosis of GLUT4-containing vesicles was not blocked by wortmannin, 2H. Shibata, W. Omata, Y. Suzuki, and I. Kojima, unpublished observations. a potent and specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(36.Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an observation indicating that GTPγS acts at a step(s) distal to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase presumably by a direct interaction with vesicle trafficking machinery. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4:, Figure 5:, the inhibitory effect of the Rab4-(191-210) peptide on the insulin action was also observed in the presence of Dk-(62-85). Because the Dk-(62-85)peptide is a potent inhibitor of the internalization of the insulin receptor (37.Stagsted J. Reaven G.M. Hansen T. Goldstein A. Olsson L. Cell. 1990; 62: 297-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) as well as GLUT4, the insulin receptor remains on the cell surface in the presence of the peptide. The notion that Rab4 is involved in the insulin action on glucose transport is further supported by the experiment using antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal domain of Rab4. As demonstrated in Fig. 7, the anti-Rab4 antibody markedly reduced the insulin-stimulated glucose transport without affecting the basal transport activity. Hence, in the present study, two independent methods to modify the function of the Rab4 carboxyl-terminal domain provided essentially similar results. In summary, the present results demonstrate that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the Rab4 hypervariable domain specifically inhibits the insulin-stimulated glucose transport as well as GLUT4 translocation, providing evidence that Rab4 is involved in the insulin action, especially in exocytotic recruitment by the hormone of the glucose transporter to the plasma membrane from the intracellular pool. In the light of the observation that insulin stimulates exocytosis of the receptors for transferrin(42.Davis R.J. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8708-8711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it would be very intriguing to examine whether the Rab4 function is directly activated by the hormone or not."

The full-length cDNA encoded a previously unidentified 27-kDa protein (mouse transporter protein (MTP)) with four predicted transmembrane-spanning domains. MTP mRNA was detected in cells of several mammalian species, and its predicted protein sequence exhibited near identity (98%) with that of a human cDNA (HUMORF13). MTP and its homologs evidently reside in an intracellular membrane compartment because a protein (about 24 kDa) that was recognized by MTP-specific antibodies was observed in a subcellular fraction of rat hepatocytes enriched for Golgi membranes. Deletion of the hydrophilic C terminus of MTP, which encompassed two putative signal motifs for intracellular localization (Tyr-<i>X</i>-<i>X</i>-hydrophobic amino acid), allowed expression of recombinant protein (MTPΔC) in plasma membranes of <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. MTPΔC-expressing oocytes exhibited greater fragility than nonexpressing oocytes, and those that survived the experimental manipulations were capable of mediated uptake of thymidine, uridine, and adenosine. Thymidine uptake by MTPΔC-expressing oocytes was inhibited by thymine and dTMP. MTP may function in the transport of nucleosides and/or nucleoside derivatives between the cytosol and the lumen of an intracellular membrane-bound compartment."

In the present study, we have determined the thermodynamic parameters for the binding reactions of four B-ring analogs of colchicine with tubulin: deacetamidocolchicine (DAAC), ( 1The abbreviations used are: DAACdeacetamidocolchicinePipespiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)AC2-methoxy-5-(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl)troponeNH2-DAACdeacetylcolchicineNHMe-DAACdemecolcineNMe2-DAACN-methyldemecolcine.) deacetylcolchicine (NH2-DAAC), demecolcine (NHMeDAAC), and N-methyldemecolcine (NMe2-DAAC). Our study indicates that the presence of B-ring per se does not affect the entropic contribution significantly, as binding of both AC and DAAC are enthalpy-driven reactions. It is the amino substituent at the C-7 position in the B-ring that converts an enthalpy-driven reaction into an entropy-driven reaction.

All other reagents used were of analytical grade. Other colchicine analogs were gifts from T. J. Fitzgerald (Florida A & M University) and Susan Bane Hastie (SUNY, Binghamton). Goat brain tubulin, free of microtubule-associated proteins, was prepared by two cycles of assembly-disassembly in PEM buffer (0.05 M Pipes, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 6.9, at 25°C) in presence of 1 mM GTP followed by two more cycles in 1 M glutamate buffer (26.Hamel E. Lin L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and stored at −70°C. The concentration of protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(27.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stock solutions of colchicine and its analogs were prepared either in water or in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The maximum concentration of Me2SO in the reaction mixture was 5% for DAAC and was less than 1% for other colchicinoids. The concentrations of the ligands were determined from the respective extinction coefficients(22.Pyles E.A. Bane Hastie S.

The kinetics of the association of colchicinoids with tubulin were measured under pseudo-first-order conditions using a Hitachi F-3000 spectrofluorometer. Concentrations of tubulin and colchicinoids were 1 and 20 μM, respectively. The ligand was added to tubulin solution, and emission at 336 nm was measured upon excitation at 295 nm (excitation slits = 5 nm). Under these experimental conditions, no aggregation of tubulin was detected by the size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography column(22.Pyles E.A. Bane Hastie S.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using the following biexponential equation: where F is the fluorescence of the ligand-tubulin complex at time t, A and B are the amplitudes for the fast and slow phases, k1 and k2 are the pseudo-first-order rate constants for these two phases, respectively, and C is an integration constant. As, for all the tubulin-colchicinoid complexes, the amplitude of the slow phase, B, was small relative to that of the fast phase, A, the slow phase was not analyzed further(28.Lambeir A. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3279-3282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent second-order rate constant (kon), was obtained by dividing the observed rate constant for the fast phase (k1) by the ligand concentration. Association rate constants were determined at different temperatures ranging from 17 to 37°C. The dissociation of colchicinoid-tubulin complexes were measured by monitoring the time-dependent increase of intrinsic protein fluorescence as the ligand was released from its binding site on tubulin upon a 300-fold dilution of the complex(17.Bane S. Puett D. MacDonald T.L. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7391-7398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process was described as a single first-order reaction. The rate constant of this process was determined using the relation where F∝ and F are the maximum intrinsic protein fluorescence intensity at infinite time and at time t, respectively, and koff is the first-order dissociation rate constant. Dissociation rate constants were determined at different temperatures ranging from 17 to 37°C. Scatchard analysis of DAAC-tubulin interaction was performed at different temperatures ranging from 17 to 37°C according to Banerjee et al.(29.Banerjee A. D'Hoore A. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10324-10329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). can be written as follows: where Fo is the fluorescence at time zero, F∝ is the fluorescence when saturation was reached, and r = A/B. The unknown parameters are k1, k2, Fo, F∞, and r. Each of these was systematically varied within a given range, and statistical estimates of the quality of fit for obtained F with the experimentally determined curve were performed for each point of iteration. The parameters obtained for the best-fit curve giving minimum X2 value were thus calculated using a BASIC program written for this purpose. For dissociation kinetics, the two unknown parameters koff and F∞ were varied and the best-fit values giving minimum X2 were obtained by similar iteration on. In the present study, the association rate constants of DAAC, NH2-DAAC, NHMe-DAAC, NMe2-DAAC, and colchicine (see Fig. 1 for structures) with tubulin were determined by drug-induced quenching of tubulin fluorescence. Fig. 2inset shows a representative kinetic profile for the binding of NHMe-DAAC to tubulin at 25°C. Apparent second-order rate constants (kon) at different temperatures were determined from bi-exponential curves for fluorescence versus time, fitted to experimental data as described “Experimental Procedures.” kon for the various ligands interacting with tubulin were plotted against 1/T and are shown in Fig. 2. The second-order rate constants for the fast phase at 37°C are presented in Table 1, along with the calculated values of activation energies (Ea′) and the pre-exponential factor (A) obtained from Fig. 2. Values of second-order rate constants and activation energies of deacetamidocolchicine and three aminocolchicinoids are in good agreement with those determined by Pyles and Hastie (22.Pyles E.A. Bane Hastie S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) for the calculation of thermodynamic parameters in the transition states. A comparison of the association rates of AC and DAAC clearly reveals that the B-ring itself has a dramatic effect on the association rate, although the activation energies of binding of both drugs are identical. According to Arrhenius equation, the rate constant is a product of the activation energy term (Ea) and the pre-exponential factor A, i.e.kon = A•e−Ea/RT. Whiletheactivationenergymeasuresthetemperaturesensitivityofareaction (determinedfromtheslopeoftheactivationenergycurve), A is related to activation entropy. Thus, two reactions with different rate constants might have the same A value but different activation energies and vice versa. We calculated the values of A for AC and DAAC binding to tubulin from the Arrhenius plot and found that it is about 70 times higher for AC compared to DAAC. The activation entropy is related to the pre-exponential factor A by the following equation(30.Barrow G.M. Physical Chemistry. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1973: 473Google Scholar): Table 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab where Δn is the change in the number of molecules when the complex is formed and (ΔS) ‡is the activation entropy. Transition state free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of AC and DAAC binding to tubulin have recently been measured(22.Pyles E.A. Bane Hastie S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The free energy and enthalpy values in the transition states are very close for both AC and DAAC, whereas entropy values differ significantly(22.Pyles E.A. Bane Hastie S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This difference in the activation entropies of AC-tubulin and DAAC-tubulin interaction probably arises from the restriction imposed upon DAAC by the presence of the B-ring and thus accounts for the difference in pre-exponential factors (Table 1). The effect of substitutions on the B-ring on the rate constants, activation energies, and A values of the binding of DAAC and aminocolchicinoids are compared in Table 1. A significant drop in the association rates and a significant enhancement in the activation energies is apparent when NH2 group is present at the C-7 position of the B-ring. However, substitution by further bulky group(s) (e.g. NHMe and NMe2 groups) did not affect either the association rate or the activation energy. What really happens to the binding process when -NH2 is substituted at the C-7 position in the B-ring is difficult to understand from the present state of knowledge of B-ring analogs binding to tubulin. It is to be noted that whereas colchicine is highly soluble in water, other aminocolchicinoids studied here are weakly soluble, indicating that the solvation property of those molecules are very much influenced by the side chain at C-7 position. The presence of lone pair of electrons of nitrogen will significantly influence the carbonyl oxygen of colchicine side chain as follows: Thus, the oxygen of the colchicine side chain and the electron rich nitrogen atom in aminocolchicinoids can serve as potential electron donor in making hydrogen bond with surroundings. It is possible that the amino and carbonyl groups are involved in making important contacts with the protein in the complex form. Recently, it was proposed that the substituents in the B-ring of aminocolchicinoids point away from the colchicine binding site toward the exterior of the protein during their interaction with tubulin(22.Pyles E.A. Bane Hastie S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our thermodynamic data also support this proposition (see below). We observe a dramatic change in the enthalpy and the entropy of the tubulin binding reaction of DAAC when compared with that of other aminocolchicinoids (Table 2).Table 2 Open table in a new tab Dissociation rate constants were determined by measuring the enhancement of intrinsic protein fluorescence due to release of colchicinoids from tubulin-colchicinoid complexes upon a 300-fold dilution of the complex by PEM buffer. This method has been successfully used previously to determine the dissociation kinetics of AC-tubulin complexes(17.Bane S. Puett D. MacDonald T.L. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7391-7398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation rate constants were determined using (see “Experimental Procedures”). The temperature dependence of dissociation rate constants for DAAC, NH2-DAAC, NHMe-DAAC, and NMe2-DAAC were also determined by the same procedure. A comparison of dissociation rate constants (see Table 1) indicates that the presence of B-ring significantly lowers the dissociation rate of drug-tubulin complexes. The dissociation rates for DAAC-tubulin complex and aminocolchicinoid-tubulin complexes are 18-30-fold less than that of AC-tubulin complex (Table 1). However, the first-order dissociation rates for DAAC-tubulin and aminocolchicinoid-tubulin complexes are comparable and are about 100-150-fold higher than that of the colchicine-tubulin complex. It was suggested previously that the >C=O in the side chain is responsible for the poor reversibility of the colchicine-tubulin interaction(19.Bhattacharyya B. Howard R. Maity S.N. Brossi A. Sharma P.N. Wolff. J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2052-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Dissociation rate of another colchicine analog wherein >C=O was substituted by >C=S (colchicine fluorescein) (see Fig. 1) was determined under identical conditions. The rate constant (1.6 × 10−3 s−1 at 27°C) was similar to those obtained for DAAC or other aminocolchicinoids and much greater than that for colchicine, supporting the earlier hypothesis(19.Bhattacharyya B. Howard R. Maity S.N. Brossi A. Sharma P.N. Wolff. J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2052-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Equilibrium constants (Ka) have been calculated using the following equation: where kon and koff are the apparent second-order association rate constant and first-order dissociation rate constant, respectively. After calculating Ka values at different temperatures, van't Hoff plots for all four colchicinoids were done as shown in Fig. 3. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated and are presented in Table 2. Our data (Table 2) clearly indicate that like AC-tubulin interaction, DAAC-tubulin interaction has negative enthalpy of binding and has small positive ΔS (15.8 cal K−1 mol−1). Both kinetic and equilibrium studies for the DAAC-tubulin interaction provide similar thermodynamic parameters. ( 2G. Chakrabarti, S. Sengupta, and B. Bhattacharyya, unpublished observation.) However, when an amino group is substituted at C-7 in the B-ring as in NH2-DAAC, the interaction with tubulin becomes entropy driven, and the positive ΔS increases to 46.5 cal K−1 mol−1. The positive ΔS remains unaltered when a methyl group is substituted in NH2-DAAC, as in demecolcine-tubulin interaction. We have reported very similar thermodynamic parameters for demecolcine-tubulin interaction using equilibrium method(31.Ray K. Bhattacharyya B. Biswas B.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Addition of another methyl group as in NMe2-DAAC causes a further increase in entropy to 54.9 cal K−1 mol−1. These data clearly establish that the bare B-ring itself has no significant effect in the thermodynamics of drug binding with tubulin. Rather, it is the B-ring substituent(s) that convert an enthalpy-driven reaction into an entropy-driven one. Early equilibrium studies on colchicine-tubulin interaction reported high positive entropy value for the binding reaction(8.Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 24.Bryan J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2611-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Later, these data were questioned for two reasons: first, these were possibly obtained in conditions where true equilibrium has not been reached; second, proper corrections were not made for the decay of colchicine binding site(20.Menendez M. Laynez J. Medrano F.J. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16367-16371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the study of Diaz and Andreu(25.Diaz J.F. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2890-2896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where corrections were made for the decay of colchicine binding site, the colchine-tubulin interaction was found to be accompanied by negative enthalpy change. A negative enthalpy value for the colchicine-tubulin interaction was also obtained from calorimetric study(20.Menendez M. Laynez J. Medrano F.J. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16367-16371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that in one of the earlier equilibrium studies, tubulin used for the binding was in the form of vinblastine paracrystals, where tubulin is stable for several days at room temperature(24.Bryan J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2611-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Moreover, vinblastine paracrystals and colchicine were incubated together for 24 h at room temperature for the binding study(24.Bryan J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2611-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 32.Bryan J. Exp. Cell. Res. 1971; 66: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, it is difficult to conceive that the decay of the colchicine binding site and non-attainment of equilibrium is responsible for the above reported result(20.Menendez M. Laynez J. Medrano F.J. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16367-16371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Diaz J.F. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2890-2896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the thermodynamic data of the binding reaction presented in Table 2 show that the changes in enthalpy and entropy upon binding are compensatory. This “compensatory” effect is shown in Fig. 4, where ΔH is plotted as a function of TΔS at 310 K. In this plot, the slope, i.e. d(ΔH)/d(TΔS), is close to 1. It is interesting to note that values of ΔH and TΔS for the interaction of tubulin with colchicine and AC were taken from the literature (17.Bane S. Puett D. MacDonald T.L. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7391-7398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Bryan J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2611-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and plotted with that of aminocolchicinoids studied here. Similar enthalpy-entropy compensation with slope close to 1 has been observed in many protein-ligand interactions where the experimental conditions are fixed and only the ligand structure is varied (Congener series)(33.Lumry R. Rajender S. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 2890-2896Google Scholar, 34.Belleau B. Lavoie J.L. Can. J. Biochem. 1988; 46: 1397-1409Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Arguments have been made that the perturbation, release, or shift in the state of water upon the binding of ligand to a protein is the primary source of compensating enthalpy and entropy changes. Another explanation for this compensation arises from the assumption that the protein is in equilibrium between two different states and that the ligand binds to either state with different affinities(35.Eftink M.R. Anusiem A.C. Biltonen R.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3884-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although the ligands used in this study do not induce aggregation of tubulin dimers, the effects of ligands on dimer-monomer equilibrium of tubulin may be questioned. Colchicine binding to tubulin favors dimer ◒ monomer equilibrium toward dimer(36.Detrich III, H.W. Williams Jr., R.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2392-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 37.Sackett D.L. Lippoldt R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3511-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38.Panda D. Roy S. Bhattacharyya B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9709-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We observed that all of these colchicinoids affect dimer ◒ monomer equilibrium and favors dimer formation very similar to that of colchicine. Furthermore, it has now been established that colchicine and its analogs can bind tubulin in its dimer and monomer forms equally well(39.Shearwin K.E. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 894-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 40.Wolff J. Knipling L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16809-16812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since all of these ligands affects dimer ◒ monomer equilibrium similarly and in the same direction, and as both dimer and monomer of tubulin can bind ligands equally well, the differential affects of ligands on the state of association of tubulin do not arise. It was recently proposed by Pyles and Bane Hastie (22.Pyles E.A. Bane Hastie S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that the B-ring substituent of aminocolchicinoids resides outside the colchicine binding site and makes contact(s) with tubulin. Results presented in this report support their hypothesis. This contact of the substituent with the protein would cause a reorganization of the water structure around the protein and the ligand species toward a greater disorder of the water molecules compared to the isolated individually hydrated species(41.Ross P.D. Subramaniam S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3096-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (4727) Google Scholar, 42.Garland D.L. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4266-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This probably is the simple explanation for the observed high values of entropy change accompanying the binding reaction. -We thank Dr. Siddhartha Roy and Dr. Pradip Parrack (Bose Institute) for valuable discussion during the course of the work."

INTRODUCTIONThe enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR, EC 1.1.1.34) 1The abbreviations used are: HMGR3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductaseERendoplasmic reticulumPCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisEndo Hendo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. catalyzes the synthesis of mevalonic acid, a major rate-limiting step in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway(1.Bach T.J. Lipids. 1995; 30: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This enzyme has been extensively studied in mammalian systems due to its critical role in mediating cholesterol biosynthesis. In mammals, HMGR is a 97-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is encoded by a single gene, and functions in the production of sterols, dolichol, prenyl modifications of proteins, steroid hormones, and several other non-sterol isoprenoid compounds(2.Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, plants synthesize a significantly greater and more diverse array of isoprenoids (in excess of 22,000 different compounds), which function in many aspects of plant growth, development, reproduction, and disease resistance(1.Bach T.J. Lipids. 1995; 30: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 3.Chappell J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 521-547Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Consistent with this complexity, plant HMGRs exist as multiple isozymes and are encoded by small gene families. Specific members of the HMGR gene families are differentially expressed during development or in response to environmental factors, and distinct HMGR isoforms may be critical in directing the flux of pathway intermediates into specific isoprenoid compounds ((3.Chappell J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 521-547Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 4.Weissenborn D.L. Denbow C.J. Laine M. Lang S.S. Yang Z. Yu X. Cramer C.L. Physiol.

Although synthesis of many of these compounds occurs in the cytosol, several classes of isoprenoids are synthesized in plastids (e.g. carotenoids, plastoquinone, phylloquinone), mitochondria (e.g. ubiquinone), or specialized vesicles (e.g. rubber). HMGR activity has been associated with mitochondria and chloroplasts in addition to microsomes although the organellar location of plant HMGRs remains controversial(1.Bach T.J. Lipids. 1995; 30: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).The domain structure of plant, animal, and fungal HMGRs can be roughly divided into three regions: the C-terminal catalytic domain, the N-terminal transmembrane domain, and a divergent linker or hinge region. The catalytic domain, consisting of about 400 amino acids at the C terminus of the protein, is highly conserved between organisms (7.Basson M.E. Thorsness M. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Rine J. Mol.

The N-terminal membrane domain shows greater divergence between organisms and is significantly smaller in plant species compared with yeast or animal HMGRs(10.Monfar M. Caelles C. Balcells L.

In mammalian systems, the N-terminal domain of HMGR contains a highly hydrophobic region of about 340 amino acids, which lacks a typical N-terminal signal peptide or signal peptide cleavage site. This domain is necessary and sufficient to confer localization to ER (microsomal) membranes (12.Brown D.A. Simoni R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recent evidence using specific antibodies raised against synthetic peptides from the HMGR membrane domain supports a model with eight membrane-spanning regions and both the C and N termini localized on the cytosolic face(13.Olender E.H.

The HMGR membrane domains of yeast, Drosophila, sea urchin, and Xenopus show a similar transmembrane organization of 7-8 membrane spans based on hydropathy and sequence comparisons(7.Basson M.E.

The significance of this reduced membrane domain is unknown although plants presumably lack the requirement for rapid down-regulation of sterol biosynthesis since no dietary source is utilized.Because the membrane domain of plant HMGRs differs so markedly from that of animal and yeast HMGRs, we are interested in experimentally determining the transmembrane structure of plant HMGRs and the role of this simplified domain in subcellular localization. As a first step toward this goal, we initiated experiments to analyze microsomal targeting and transmembrane orientation of two distinct tomato HMGR isoforms. Tomato contains at least 4 genes encoding HMGR(20.Narita J.O. Cui X. Kim G.S. Gruissem W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 15A (abstr.): A447Google Scholar, 22.Park H.-S. Denbow C.J. Cramer C.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The current study uses HMG1 and HMG2 N-terminal peptides generated from the differentially regulated tomato HMGR isogenes, hmg1 and hmg2. Tomato hmg1 expression is elevated in rapidly growing cells consistent with a role in sterol biosynthesis (23.Narita J.O. Gruissem W. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24.Gillaspy G. Ben-David H. Gruissem W. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1439-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). In contrast, hmg2 is induced in response to pathogens and wounding associated with host defense responses(4.Weissenborn D.L. Denbow C.J. Laine M. Lang S.S. Yang Z. Yu X. Cramer C.L. Physiol.

Defense-related induction is correlated with increases in microsomal HMGR activity and production of isoprenoid phytoalexin antibiotics(6.Choi D. Bostock R.M. Avdiushko S. Hildebrand D.F. Proc. Natl.

Microsomal targeting and protease protection assays were performed on in vitro synthesized N-terminal domains of both HMG1 and HMG2 to establish the membrane topography of these distinct isoforms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Amplification and CloningTomato hmg1 sequences encoding the putative membrane domain were generated by reverse transcription PCR using DNA synthesized from poly(A+) RNA (29.Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5177) Google Scholar, 30.Haffner M.H. Chin M.B. Lane B.G. Can. J. Biochem. 1978; 56: 7229-7233Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) from immature tomato fruit (2-5 mm, Lycopersicon esculentum cultivar EP7) using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT) primers (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). A partial hmg1 cDNA was amplified via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; 40 cycles: 95°C, 1 min; 58°C, 2 min; 72°C, 3 min) using hmg1-specific primers 14 (5′-GGTGGGCGTGTCCCCAAATTGTAG) and 15 (5′-GAGAAGAAAACTCACTTGTTGAAC; antisense, in-frame stop codon boldface) based on partial tomato hmg1 sequences(20.Narita J.O. Cui X. Kim G.S. Gruissem W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 15A (abstr.): A447Google Scholar). The 1.2-kilobase PCR product was cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript SK− (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA) to yield the plasmid, pCD4, and sequenced according to the manufacturer's protocols (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To provide a poly(A+) tail for in vitro synthesized transcripts, the hmg1 insert of pCD4 was excised with PstI, end-filled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, digested with XbaI, and ligated into the SmaI and XbaI sites in vector pSP64 poly(A+) (Stratagene) to yield plasmid pCD4A.The N-terminal domain of hmg2 was generated from a tomato hmg2 genomic clone, pTH295(22.Park H.-S. Denbow C.J. Cramer C.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), by PCR amplification using primers 23 (5′-CTTTGTCGACCATGGACGTTCGCCGGAGAT) and 5 (5′-CGCAAGCTTGTTCATTCCCATTGCATCACCAGT) as described above. The resulting hmg2-specific fragment, which contains exon I starting at the translation start site, intron I, and part of exon II, was inserted into the SmaI site of pBluescript SK− to yield plasmid pXY12. A c-myc epitope (31.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar) was incorporated into a BglII site of pXY12 just downstream of the translation start site. The resulting plasmid, pXY12(c-myc), encodes a polypeptide (HMG2(myc)) that begins MDVRRRSEQKLISEEDLLGSEEP … (c-myc epitope is underlined).In Vitro TranscriptionRNA was transcribed in vitro from plasmids pCD4A and pXY12(c-myc) following the manufacturer's protocols (Promega). Plasmid pCD4A (5 μg/reaction) was linearized with EcoRI and transcribed using SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of the RNA cap analog P1-5′-(7-methyl)-guanosine-P3-5′-guanosine triphosphate (Boehringer Mannheim). The plasmid pXY12(c-myc) (5 μg) was linearized with SstI and transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting RNAs were resuspended in 20 μl of water, and 1-μl aliquots were used for in vitro translation.In Vitro Translation, Microsomal Insertion, and Protease Protection AnalysesTranslation of in vitro synthesized RNA was carried out using rabbit reticulocyte lysates or a wheat germ translation system in the presence or absence of dog pancreatic microsomal membranes according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega). Proteins were synthesized in the presence of [35S]methionine (1200 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) or non-radioactively by substituting L-methionine. Proteins translated in the presence of microsomes were fractionated into membrane-bound and soluble fractions; the microsomes from five translations were combined, pelleted by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4°C (Beckman SW50), and resuspended in 20 μl of buffer (50 mM HEPES, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM CaCl2). To confirm membrane insertion, translation mix (10 μl) was treated with a high salt wash (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 500 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM EDTA, 8% sucrose) on ice for 10 min and recentrifuged(32.Campos N. Palau J. Torrent M. Ludevid D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9646-9650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For protease protection studies, 10 μl of translation mix were incubated (1 h on ice) with 1 μl of proteinase K (1 mg/ml); reactions were stopped by adding 5 μl of 0.5 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) in ethanol. For experiments designed to assess the presence of N-linked glycans, 10 μl of the protease-protected microsomal fragments were treated with 1 milliunit/μl endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H, Boehringer Mannheim) and 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) overnight at 37°C.Translation products, including those subsequently fractionated or protease-treated, were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)(33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Ten μl of the original volume of the translation mixture (25 μl) were added to 20 μl of gel loading buffer (10% v/v glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 1% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol in 60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and heated (95°C, 5 min). Five μl of radioactively labeled translation samples were loaded per lane on SDS-PAGE gels (12 or 18% separating; 5% stacking gel). After electrophoresis, gels were fixed (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 1 h), treated for 1 h with Enlightning (DuPont NEN), dried, and exposed to XAR film (Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Both low (Amersham Corp.) and high (Life Technologies, Inc.) molecular weight 14C-labeled protein standards were included on the gels.Western Blotting and ImmunodetectionThe microsomal fractions from five nonradioactive translations were combined and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (DuPont NEN) overnight at 4°C (mini-transblot transfer cell, Bio-Rad). Filters were incubated overnight with 1:250 dilution of the anti-myc monoclonal antibody (100 μg/ml, myc(Ab-1) mouse IgG 9E10, Oncogene Science, Inc., Uniondale, NY). The second antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody (Amersham Corp.) was diluted from 1:3,000 to 1:20,000 and detection was done using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocols except that additional blocking agent (5% dry milk) was included in the antibody incubation steps.RESULTSSequence Analysis of the N Termini of Tomato HMG1 and HMG2We isolated and sequenced a clone (pCD4) encoding exon I of tomato HMG1 (GenBank accession no. L40938). The predicted amino acid sequence for this clone is nearly identical to that of a partial tomato HMG1 sequence published previously(34.Bach T.J. Boronat A. Caelles C. Ferrer A. Weber T. Wettstein A. Lipids. 1991; 26: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The HMG1 sequences show 74.8% nucleic acid sequence identity and 79.6% amino acid identity (87.4% similarity(35.Devereux J. Haeverli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11516) Google Scholar)) with the analogous region of tomato HMG2 previously isolated in this laboratory(22.Park H.-S. Denbow C.J. Cramer C.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequences of tomato HMG1 and HMG2 are compared with other plant HMGRs in Fig. 2A. Although the N-terminal 200 amino acids are relatively divergent compared with the C-terminal catalytic domain (4.Weissenborn D.L. Denbow C.J. Laine M. Lang S.S. Yang Z. Yu X. Cramer C.L. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 93: 393-400Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), several regions of high sequence conservation are evident. The first six amino acids are quite conserved and are high in basic amino acids that may represent an ER retention signal(41.Schultz M.-P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1696-1705Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The most highly conserved region (that which aligns with tomato HMG2 residues 44-120) contains two hydrophobic segments (Fig. 2B), each of which extends over 20 amino acids, a distance sufficient to span a membrane bilayer.Figure 2:A, sequence comparison of plant HMGR N termini. Sequences include tomato (L. esculentum) HMG1 and HMG2 (Tom1, Tom2(22.Park H.-S. Denbow C.J. Cramer C.L. Plant Mol.

In contrast, the hydrophilic region between the two putative transmembrane spans is highly conserved among plant HMGRs. Interestingly, this conserved region, which is predicted to lie within the ER lumen, varies with respect to a potential asparagine-linked glycosylation site (N-X-S/T; Fig. 2A).Insertion of HMG1 and HMG2 into Microsomal MembranesIn order to demonstrate microsomal targeting of tomato HMG1 and HMG2, labeled peptides were synthesized in vitro in the presence or absence of dog pancreatic microsomes. For both HMGRs, regions encoded by exon I and utilizing in-frame stop codons provided by intron I sequences yielded N-terminal peptides comprising about 60% of full-length HMGR. Microsomal targeting, integral membrane association, and N-terminal signal peptide cleavage were assessed by comparing HMGR peptides in the presence or absence of microsomes and/or following proteinase treatment. The hydropathy data (Fig. 2) were used to predict the sizes of proteinase K-insensitive peptides of HMG1 and HMG2 based on one versus two transmembrane spans (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Sizes of transmembrane and lumenal peptides predicted to be protected from proteinase K digestion, comparing models having one versus two membrane-spanning regions and maintaining the location of the C terminus (catalytic domain in the full-length HMGR) in the cytosol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The sizes of HMG1 and HMG2 N-terminal peptides resulting from rabbit reticulocyte lysate-mediated translation of in vitro synthesized mRNAs (Fig. 4) were consistent with those predicted from the derived amino acid sequences (37.5 kDa for HMG1- and 39.3 kDa for HMG2-exon I-encoded products). In vitro translation was enhanced in the presence of microsomes (Fig. 4, lanes 3). The peptides synthesized in the presence of microsomes were the same size as those synthesized without microsomes (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting either that microsomal insertion was unsuccessful or that no signal peptide was cleaved during synthesis and insertion. That HMGR peptides were in fact integrally associated with microsomal membranes was demonstrated by co-sedimentation of labeled HMGR peptides with microsomal membranes upon re-isolation by centrifugation (Fig. 4, lanes 4). Membrane insertion was further confirmed by the inability of a high salt wash to remove the protein from the microsomal pellet (data not shown) and the detection of protease-insensitive fragments (Fig. 4, lanes 6). Proteinase K treatment of peptides translated in the absence of microsomes resulted in complete loss of the protein (Fig. 4, lanes 5), whereas small protected fragments were evident following digestion of peptides synthesized in the presence of microsomes (Fig. 4, lanes 6). The protease-insensitive fragments were not detected if protease treatment was carried out in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, which should liberate peptides from the membranes (data not shown). In order to address whether HMGR microsomal insertion occurred co- or post-translationally, microsomes were added to the translation mix following peptide synthesis (in vitro translation was carried out for 1 h and stopped by addition of 2 mM cycloheximide). In this case, labeled HMGR peptides were not detected in microsomal pellets (data not shown), suggesting co-translational insertion. We also tested the efficiency of in vitro translation of tomato HMG2 using a wheat germ translation system (lacking soluble signal recognition particle(12.Brown D.A. Simoni R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1674-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). The wheat germ system was less efficient in synthesizing HMG2 (HMG1 was not tested), and translation was not enhanced by microsomes (data not shown). These data are consistent with co-translational, signal recognition particle-dependent insertion into ER membranes analogous to that determined for mammalian HMGRs(12.Brown D.A. Simoni R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1674-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Figure 4:Insertion of HMG1 and HMG2 into microsomal membranes. In vitro synthesized mRNAs encoding HMG1 and HMG2 peptides were translated in the presence of [35S]methionine. Translation was carried out in the presence of dog pancreatic microsomes (M) and/or followed by treatment with proteinase K (P) as indicated prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. The positions of molecular mass markers are indicated. Bands corresponding to HMGR products and protected fragments (PF) are indicated by arrows. Lane 1, no RNA control; lane 2, translation of mRNA in absence of microsomes; lane 3, translation of mRNA in the presence of microsomes; lane 4, microsomal pellet; lane 5, translation in absence of microsomes and followed by proteinase K treatment; lane 6, translation in the presence of microsomes and followed by proteinase K treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The size of the protease-protected fragments for both HMG1 and HMG2 was estimated at 6-8 kDa (e.g. Fig. 4, lanes 6) using several different acrylamide concentrations (data not shown). The signal for the HMG2 proteinase K-insensitive fragment was weaker than that for HMG1 due to decreased translational efficiency of the HMG2 vector (which lacks a poly(A) tail) and fewer methionine residues within the protected region. The protease-insensitive peptides for HMG1 and HMG2 were reproducibly smaller than that predicted for a single transmembrane span (Fig. 3, model B). These data are consistent with predictions based on two transmembrane spans linked by a short lumenal domain as shown in model A of Fig. 3.Localizat"
https://openalex.org/W2080438420,"Gz is a member of the family of trimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins), which plays a crucial role in signaling across cell membranes. The expression of Gz is predominately confined to neuronal cells and platelets, suggesting an involvement in a neuroendocrine process. Although the signaling pathway in which Gz participates is not yet known, it has been linked to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. We have found that arachidonate and related unsaturated fatty acids suppress guanine nucleotide binding to the α subunit of Gz. This inhibition of nucleotide binding by cis-unsaturated fatty acids is specific for Gzα; other G protein α subunits are relatively insensitive to these lipids. The IC50 for inhibition by the lipids closely corresponds to their critical micellar concentrations, suggesting that the interaction of the lipid micelle with Gzα is the primary event leading to inhibition. The presence of the acidic group of the fatty acid is critical for inhibition, as no effect is observed with the corresponding fatty alcohol. While arachidonic acid produces near-complete inhibition of both GDP and guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate binding by Gzα, release of GDP from the protein was unaffected. Furthermore, the rate of inactivation of Gzα by arachidonate is essentially identical to the rate of GDP release from the protein, indicating that GDP release is required for inactivation. These observations indicate that the mechanism of inactivation of Gzα by unsaturated fatty acids is through an interaction of an acidic lipid micelle with the nucleotide-free form of the protein. Although the physiologic significance of this finding is unclear, similar effects of unsaturated fatty acids on other proteins involved in cell signaling indicate potential roles for these lipids in signal modulation. Additionally, the ability of arachidonate to inactivate this adenylyl cyclase-inhibitory G protein provides a molecular mechanism for previous findings that treatment of platelets with arachidonate results in elevated cAMP levels.

Trimeric guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) ( 1The abbreviations used are: G proteinsguanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteinsGTPγSguanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphateDTTdithiothreitolCMCcritical micellar concentration.) comprise a class of membrane-associated proteins that participate in a wide variety of signal transduction pathways by communicating the external signal from cell surface receptors to intracellular effector molecules(1.Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar, 2.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar). These G proteins are αβγ heterotrimers, consisting of two functional subunits, an α subunit containing bound guanine nucleotide, and a βγ complex. In the resting (GDP-bound) state, a G protein can interact with a liganded receptor in a fashion that drives the exchange of GDP for GTP on the α subunit. The α-GTP and βγ subunits then dissociate, and both subunit complexes can interact with, and modulate the activity of, downstream effectors. The signal is terminated by an intrinsic GTPase activity of the α subunit; subsequent reassociation with the βγ complex returns the system to its resting state. Effector molecules for G proteins include adenylyl cyclase, certain subtypes of phospholipase C, and various ion channels (3.Taussig R. Gilman A. J. Biol.

G proteins are classified through the identity of their α subunit. The high sequence homology among these polypeptides has led to the cloning of several forms for which precise physiologic roles have not yet been ascribed. One such isotype is Gzα(5.Matsuoka M.

The distribution of Gzα is limited primarily to platelets and neurons, implicating this G protein in some specific role in these tissues(5.Matsuoka M. Itoh H. Kaziro Y. J. Biol.

The protein has been purified from bovine brain as well as a bacterial expression system and shown to possess biochemical properties distinct from other G protein α subunits(9.Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, nucleotide exchange by Gzα is highly dependent on free magnesium concentrations. At free magnesium concentrations greater than 10−5 M, GTP binding by Gzα is nearly completely suppressed. This effect is not seen with other G proteins; in fact, the presence of high magnesium concentrations generally stimulates their rates of nucleotide exchange(2.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar). Magnesium-dependent suppression of nucleotide exchange is observed, however, with members of the monomeric family of GTP-binding proteins, e.g. Ras(10.Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gzα also has a very slow intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis, more similar to that of Ras and Ras-related proteins than α subunits(9.Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Gz is formally a member of the Gi family, it is insensitive to ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by pertussis toxin(9.Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

A property that Gzα does share with most members of the Gi family is an ability to mediate inhibition of adenylyl cyclase(12.Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13.Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In addition, Gzα serves as an excellent substrate for activated protein kinase C both in vitro and in intact platelets(14.Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and evidence has been obtained that this phosphorylation blocks subunit interactions of this G protein(15.Fields T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23119-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Several reports have appeared recently, indicating that particular biogenically active lipids can interact in vitro with signaling proteins and modulate their activities. For example, arachidonate and related unsaturated fatty acids physically associate with, and inhibit the activity of, the Ras GTPase activating protein known as GAP(16.Tsai M.-H. Roudebush M. Dobrowolski S. Yu C.-L. Gibbs J.B. Stacey D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2785-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17.Serth J. Lautwein A. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. Pingoud A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1325-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Such lipids can also regulate the association of the Ras-related protein, Rac, with a specific GDP dissociation inhibitor(18.Chuang T.-H. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26206-26211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, cis-unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate and arachidonate have been shown to activate protein kinase C(19.Khan W.A. Blobe G.C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3605-3612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the mechanism by which lipids modulate the activities of these proteins is not completely defined, their interaction raises interesting possibilities for the role of lipids in cellular regulation. In this study, we demonstrate that cis-unsaturated fatty acids block GTPγS binding by Gzα. The mechanism of inactivation involves a specific effect of lipid micelles on the nucleotide-free form of the protein. These observations are of particular interest since the tissues in which Gzα is found are known to accumulate significant levels of arachidonic acid in response to certain activating stimuli(20.Haslam R.J. Verstraite M. Vermylen J. Lijnen H.R. Arnout J. Thrombosis and Haemostasis. International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis and Leuven University Press, Leuven1987: 147-174Google Scholar, 21.Hildebrandt E. Albanesi J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and thus the potential exists for cross-talk between arachidonate-producing pathways and those controlled by Gz. Recombinant Gzα was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously(9.Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was stored at −80°C in 50 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 5 mM MgCl2, supplemented with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Recombinant Gsα was purified from a bacterial expression system as described(22.Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant Giα1, Giα3, and Goα were generous gifts of Maurine Linder (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis MO) (23.Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All lipids were purchased from Sigma, dissolved in ethanol at final concentrations of 50 mM, and stored under N2 at −80°C. For the preparation of pure micelles, the required amount of ethanolic lipid solution was dried under vacuum and suspended in 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT. This suspension was subjected to bath sonication until homogenous. Mixed micelles were prepared by dissolving the dried lipids in the same buffer containing 0.1% Lubrol (ICN) at 30°C with vortexing or brief sonication. Guanine nucleotide binding by G protein α subunits was quantitated as described previously(24.Northrup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-5 pmol of the protein to be analyzed was diluted to 30 μl with 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and, where indicated, 0.1% Lubrol. 30 μl of GTPγS binding mix consisting of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 2 μM [35S]GTPγS (specific activity, ~10,000 cpm/pmol) was then added. In experiments investigating competition between arachidonate and GTPγS, the concentration of the nucleotide was varied as indicated in the appropriate figure legend. Reactions were initiated by addition of protein, and, unless otherwise indicated, incubation conditions were set as a function of the intrinsic rates of exchange of the various α subunits. These were Gzα, 30 min at 30°C; Giα1 and Giα3, 20 min at 30°C; Goα, 2 min at 20°C; Gsα, 6 min at 20°C. Free Mg2+ concentration during incubation was 700 nM unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM NaCl. Samples were kept on ice until filtration through BA85 nitrocellulose filters. Filters were dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. For experiments assessing the time course of GDP dissociation from Gzα, 11 pmol of the protein were incubated at 30°C for 60 min in the presence of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% Lubrol, and 0.5 μM [3H]GDP (specific activity, ~26,000 cpm/pmol). Arachidonic acid (300 μM) or palmitic acid (300 μM) in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1% Lubrol was added, and samples were incubated for an additional 2 min. Samples were then spiked with unlabeled GDP such that the final concentration of GDP in the “chase” was 50 μM. The addition of arachidonate and GDP were of small enough volume as not to significantly perturb the relative concentration of protein or detergent. At the time points indicated in the appropriate figure, aliquots of Gzα were removed to ice-cold buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM MgCl2) and stored on ice until filtration through BA85 nitrocellulose filters. Filters were dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. For experiments demonstrating the recovery of binding activity with time, Gzα (7.6 pmol) was incubated under the standard reaction conditions plus 300 μM arachidonte. After 5 min, the reaction was diluted 10-fold with 50 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% Lubrol, and 2 μM GTPγS. At the times indicated in the appropriate figure, aliquots were removed from the incubation into ice-cold buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM MgCl2), and bound nucleotide was determined. For experiments assessing the time course of inactivation of Gzα by arachidonate, ~7 pmol of protein were incubated in the presence or absence of 300 μM arachidonic acid for up to 90 min. At the time points indicated, aliquots of the incubation mixture containing 0.4 pmol of Gzα were removed and immediately subjected to a 60-min GTPγS binding assay. Transferring the protein from the pre-incubation to the GTPγS binding reaction effectively diluted the arachidonate to 30 μM in the samples in which the pre-incubation was performed in the presence of 300 μM lipid. Additional changes from the standard reaction mixture included the presence of 5 μM GDP during the pre-incubation to stabilize the G protein and inclusion of 10 μM [35S]GTPγS (specific, activity ~10,000 cpm/pmol) in the GTPγS binding mix. CMC values for lipids were determined by fluorescence spectroscopy as described by Chattopadhyay and London (25.Chattopadhyay A. London E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 408-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) using the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. A stock 500 μM suspension of lipid (see above) was diluted to the appropriate concentration in 500 μl of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and this mixture was then added to 500 μl of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 μM GTP. Following equilibration to room temperature, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (2 μl of a 1 mM solution in tetrahydrofuran) was added, and the tubes were incubated in the dark for at least 30 min. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer set at excitation and emission wavelengths of 358 and 430 nm, respectively. Reports of the effects of arachidonic acid on proteins involved in cell signaling prompted us to evaluate arachidonate and related lipids for potential effects on G protein activities. The initial experiments focused on Gz, since as noted in the Introduction, this G protein is predominantly expressed in tissues with highly active phospholipase A2 pathways. We first tested various fatty acids for their effect on the ability of Gzα to bind GTPγS, a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP. As shown in Fig. 1, the 20-carbon unsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid, dramatically inhibited the ability of Gzα to bind guanine nucleotide. GTPγS binding by Gzα was suppressed in a dose-dependent fashion, and suppression was nearly complete at a concentration of 120 μM arachidonic acid. Essentially identical results were obtained when the binding of [3H]GDP, rather then GTPγS, was examined (results not shown). The carboxyl group on the fatty acid was essential for inhibition of nucleotide binding, as the equivalent fatty alcohol, arachidonyl alcohol, was not inhibitory. Interestingly, arachidic acid, the saturated 20-carbon fatty acid, also had no effect on GTPγS binding by Gzα, indicating the requirement for the double bonds for inhibition. The ability of arachidonate to suppress GTPγS binding by Gzα prompted us to examine whether other unsaturated fatty acids exert the same effect. This was indeed found to be the case. Oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid all suppressed nucleotide binding by Gzα in the same dose-dependent fashion as arachidonic acid (Fig. 1). Oleic acid and linoleic acid both completely suppressed GTPγS binding by Gzα at a concentration of 175 μM, and linolenic acid was completely inhibitory at 250 μM. However, the trans-unsaturated fatty acid, elaidic acid, was only slightly inhibitory at these concentrations (data not shown). The steepness of the inhibition curves for the unsaturated fatty acids indicated that the inhibition was not due to a simple binding event but rather to some sort of cooperative process. One such process, which is quite obvious when working with lipids, is the formation of micelles, which is a highly cooperative aggregation event. Accordingly, we determined the CMC for the lipids under the same conditions (e.g. ionic strength, Mg2+ concentration) as for the GTPγS binding experiments. CMC values for the various lipids were determined using a fluorescence technique(24.Northrup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was found that the CMC values corresponded nearly identically to the observed IC50 for the inhibition of GTPγS binding (Table 1). For example, the observed IC50 and the CMC for arachidonic acid were 60 and 73 μM, respectively. These observations provide strong evidence that the abilities of the unsaturated fatty acids to suppress GTPγS binding by Gzα is micelle dependent; i.e. it is an interaction of the protein with an anionic lipid micelle, which is responsible for the inhibition.Table 1 Open table in a new tab To facilitate manipulation of the lipid in subsequent studies, we assessed whether the inhibition by arachidonate of the ability of Gzα to bind GTPγS occurred when the fatty acid was present in a mixed micelle. The data in Fig. 2 show that this is the case, as the same type of inhibition is observed in response to increasing arachidonic acid when the fatty acid is present in a mixed micelle with the non-ionic detergent, Lubrol. The dose-response curve is shifted substantially to the right as would be expected for a process that depends on the mole fraction of lipid in the micelle(26.Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the IC50 for inhibition of GTPγS binding by Gzα shifts in proportion to the mole fraction of the lipid (results not shown). We next determined the specificity of G protein-arachidonate interactions by determining the effect of the fatty acid on GTPγS binding by other G protein α subunits. As in the previous experiments, GTPγS binding by Gzα was inhibited 50% at 150 μM arachidonate, while at 300 μM, nucleotide binding was nearly completely suppressed (Fig. 3). GTPγS binding by Gzα, a member of the Gzα subfamily to which Gzα belongs, was not significantly inhibited at 150 μM arachidonate but was inhibited ~50% at 300 μM. The other G protein α subunits tested, including that of the closely related Gi1 as well as Go and Gs, were not inhibited by arachidonate at any concentration tested. This specificity for Gzα over other G protein α subunits suggests a potential role for arachidonate in Gz signaling and prompted us to investigate the mechanism of this lipid effect on GTPγS binding by Gzα. The binding of GTPγS by G proteins is a two-step process involving GDP release (the rate-limiting step) and subsequent diffusion-controlled GTPγS binding by the nucleotide-free protein(2.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism by which arachidonic acid inhibits GTPγS binding, we first assessed the effect of arachidonic acid on the rate of GDP release from the protein. As release of bound GDP from α subunits is the rate-limiting step in nucleotide exchange, we expected that this process would be inhibited by arachidonic acid in a fashion similar to that of GTPγS binding. Quite surprisingly, however, release of [3H]GDP from Gzα occurred with the same rate constant (Fig. 4) in the presence of 300 μM palmitic acid (a non-inhibitory fatty acid) or in the presence of 300 μM arachidonic acid, a concentration that essentially completely suppressed GTPγS binding to the protein (see Fig. 2). These data indicate that the effect of arachidonic acid is exerted at the step of GTPγS binding. This would be highly unusual since GTP binding by G proteins is normally diffusion controlled, and thus its rate would have to be reduced by many orders of magnitude before an effect on the overall binding reaction would be observed. One possibility for the selective effect of arachidonate on the GTPγS binding step is that the lipid micelle could interact specifically with the unoccupied nucleotide binding site on Gzα and effectively compete for GTPγS binding. If this were the case, inhibition of nucleotide binding by arachidonic acid should be reduced by increasing the concentration of competing nucleotide. To explore this possibility, we measured the effect of arachidonic acid on GTPγS binding in the presence of increasing GTPγS concentrations. However, assessment of the arachidonate-mediated inhibition over a 50-fold range of GTPγS revealed that binding was nearly completely suppressed at all concentrations of competing nucleotide (Fig. 5). Since inhibition of nucleotide binding by arachidonic acid was unaffected at GTPγS concentrations as high as 25 μM, which is >1000-fold above the Kd of G protein α subunits for GTPγS(2.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar), it is considered highly unlikely that the lipid micelle is competing for the nucleotide binding site of the protein. An alternative explanation for the effect of arachidonate on GTPγS binding, but not on GDP release, by Gzα is that the fatty acid could somehow interact with and inactivate the nucleotide-free form of the G protein that is a transient intermediate in the exchange process. To examine this possibility, we assessed the time dependence of the inactivation of Gzα by arachidonate. If arachidonate could exert its effect only on the nucleotide-free form of Gzα, a recovery of binding activity should be observed if the protein is exposed to high arachidonate and then is diluted to an ineffective concentration. This recovery of binding activity would then reflect the fraction of the protein that had not yet released its GDP. Furthermore, if the arachidonic acid is selectively inactivating the nucleotide-free form of Gzα, then the rate of inactivation of GTPγS binding should correspond to the rate of GDP release. Indeed, the evidence indicates that this is the case (Fig. 6). In the first experiment (Fig. 6A), binding activity was measured after Gzα was first incubated with 300 μM arachidonate for 5 min and then diluted to 30 μM arachidonate. While GTPγS binding activity was detected, the level of nucleotide binding recovered was significantly less than the control levels in which only 30 μM fatty acid had been present throughout. This same type of experiment was performed over a range of pre-incubation times with 300 μM arachidonate from 5 to 90 min; in each case, the quantity of Gzα capable of binding nucleotide was assessed after a 10-fold dilution to the ineffective concentration of the lipid (i.e. 30 μM). The results of this analysis, shown in Fig. 6B, revealed in each case a loss of GTPγS binding activity that was not recovered by subsequent dilution. This was not due simply to protein lability, as pre-incubation of Gzα in the absence of arachidonate did not result in a loss of GTPγS binding activity. An equally important finding from this experiment is that the time dependence in the loss of the binding activity of Gzα could be fit to an exponential with a decay constant of 0.028 min−1, which is nearly identical to the rate constant for GDP release from Gzα under the same conditions(9.Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that, in the presence of arachidonate, Gzα is able to release GDP normally but is then rapidly inactivated when the lipid micelle interacts with the nucleotide-free form of the protein. The role of lipids in cellular signaling has received increasing attention in recent years(27.Graber R. Sumida C. Nunez E.A. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1994; 9: 91-116PubMed Google Scholar). It is now clear that lipids such as arachidonic acid and diacylglycerol actively participate as second messengers in signaling pathways(28.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4219) Google Scholar, 29.Samuelsson B. Haeggstrom J.Z. Wetterholm A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 629: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Examples are also beginning to emerge of arachidonate and other cis-unsaturated fatty acids directly modulating activities of signaling proteins. For example, these fatty acids can associate with and alter the activity of Ras-GAP (17.Serth J. Lautwein A. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. Pingoud A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1325-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30.Tsai M.-H. Yu C.-L. Wei F.-S. Stacey D.W. Science. 1989; 243: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Cis-unsaturated fatty acids have also been shown to regulate association between the monomeric G protein, Rac, and its GDP dissociation inhibitor(18.Chuang T.-H. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26206-26211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arachidonate and other unsaturated fatty acids have also been shown to activate certain isozymes of the protein kinase, protein kinase C(19.Khan W.A. Blobe G.C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3605-3612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified an additional effect of cis-unsaturated fatty acids on a signaling protein, that being the inactivation of a G protein α subunit, specifically Gzα. Arachidonate-dependent inactivation of GTPγS binding by Gzα was quite specific for this α subunit, as treatment of a number of other α subunits had only minimal effects on their abilities to bind nucleotide. The inactivation was dependent upon the presence of an acidic group on the lipid and correlated with the formation of a lipid micelle. Several cis-unsaturated fatty acids were potent inhibitors of GTPγS binding by Gzα with a dose dependence that matched the lipid's respective CMC. This suggests that it is an interaction between the charged surface of a micelle with Gzα that is required for its inhibition. These results are similar to the results of Serth et al.(17.Serth J. Lautwein A. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. Pingoud A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1325-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), who observed the inhibition of Ras-GAP in the presence of fatty acids and acidic phospholipids but not in the presence of neutral lipids, and only under conditions in which the active lipids formed micellar structures. The inhibition of GTPγS binding by Gzα seen upon the addition of arachidonic acid could have been exerted at either of two distinct steps in the process, these being dissociation of bound GDP or association of the GTPγS. The former step was initially considered the most likely, as GDP dissociation from G proteins is ~107-fold slower than association of guanine nucleotides (31.Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the step in Gzα nucleotide exchange affected by arachidonate, we directly determined the effect of arachidonic acid on the rate of GDP release. Quite surprisingly, GDP release was virtually unaffected by concentrations of arachidonate, which essentially completely suppress GTPγS binding, indicating that GTPγS binding was the step being affected. An assessment of the time dependence of arachidonate inhibition of GTPγS binding revealed that (a) inhibition of GTPγS binding was not reversible even after 60 min of incubation and (b) the rate of this inactivation corresponded precisely with that of GDP release by Gzα. Taken together, these experiments indicate that the effect of arachidonate on the ability of Gz to bind guanine nucleotides is dependent on an association of the lipid micelle with the nucleotide-free form of the protein, resulting in an alteration of the protein that renders it inactive. While lipid-mediated modulation of G protein activity by irreversible inactivation seems an unlikely mode of regulation in the cell, the selectivity of the process for Gz over other G proteins, as well as the unique distribution of Gz, provides strong reasons to suspect that the process is physiologically relevant. As noted above, the cell types in which Gz is found, such as platelets and chromaffin cells, are known to possess high levels of phospholipase A2 activity(20.Haslam R.J. Verstraite M. Vermylen J. Lijnen H.R. Arnout J. Thrombosis and Haemostasis. International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis and Leuven University Press, Leuven1987: 147-174Google Scholar, 21.Hildebrandt E. Albanesi J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These cells are also known to produce substantial levels of arachidonate in response to external stimuli(20.Haslam R.J. Verstraite M. Vermylen J. Lijnen H.R. Arnout J. Thrombosis and Haemostasis. International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis and Leuven University Press, Leuven1987: 147-174Google Scholar, 32.Frye R.A. Holz R.W. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33.Frye R.A. Holz R.W. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Also of note in this regard are previous studies showing that treatment of platelets with high levels of exogenous arachidonate results in increased intracellular cAMP accompanied by reduced aggregation(34.Linder B.L. Goodman D.S. Blood. 1982; 60: 436-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Kowalska M.A. Rao A.K. Disa J. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In one of these studies, treatment of platelets with an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor restored aggregation in the presence of arachidonate, indicating that the fatty acid was exerting its effect at or upstream of adenylyl cyclase(35.Kowalska M.A. Rao A.K. Disa J. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The finding that arachidonate can inactivate a G protein that is both present in platelets and implicated in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase thus provides a potential molecular mechanism for these effects. Finally, it is certainly possible that in the context of an intact cell an increase in the concentration of arachidonic acid might be only transiently inhibitory, i.e. the cellular environment could provide protection of the apoprotein form of Gzα from permanent inactivation by the lipid. Possibilities here include a protective factor in these cells that associates with Gzα or one that reverses the association between Gzα and inhibitory lipids. Identification of the pathway in which Gzα participates will likely shed some light on these results and on the possibilities for the novel means of G protein regulation they may represent. -We thank Maurine Linder for the generous gift of purified Giα1, Giα3, and Goα, Dave Clapham, Joe Albanesi, and Tim Fields for helpful discussions, and Al Gilman for support during the initial stages of the work.

A. 91, 699-703), we showed that supercoiling free energy was utilized during Mu transposition to lower the activation barrier of some rate-limiting step in the formation of the cleaved Mu end synaptic complex (type I complex). We report here results from kinetic studies on the assembled but uncleaved synaptic complex (type 0). Based on the estimated rate constants for the formation of type 0 and type I complexes, as well as their temperature and superhelicity dependence, we infer that the type 0 complex is an authentic intermediate in the pathway to Mu end cleavage. Our results are consistent with type 0 production being the rate-limiting step in the overall type I reaction. The conversion of type 0 to type I complex is a fast reaction, does not show strong temperature dependence, and is apparently independent of substrate superhelicity. We have explored the DNA structure within the type 0 complex using chemical and enzymatic probes. The observed susceptibility of DNA outside the Mu ends to single-strand-specific reagents suggests that a helix opening event is associated with type 0 formation. This structural perturbation could account, at least partly, for the high activation barrier to the reaction. There is a close correlation between the appearance of single strandedness near the Mu ends and the superhelicity of the DNA substrate. It is possible that supercoiling energy is utilized in effecting specific conformational transitions within DNA. We have found that Zn2+ and Co2+ ions, like Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions, can efficiently cleave the type 0 complex. However, unlike Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions, Zn2+ and Co2+ ions cannot support assembly of type 0.

We discuss the implications of our findings for the mechanism of Mu transposition. Mu DNA transposition occurs by cleavage (nicking) of the left and right ends of Mu DNA (attL and attR), followed by joining (strand transfer) to target DNA, a reaction carried out by Mu transposase (A protein) (reviewed in Mizuuchi(1992)). The functional configuration of Mu A protein is a tetramer (Lavoie et al., 1991). Assembly of the active Mu A tetramer is a complex process requiring negatively supercoiled DNA substrate, a set of six att subsites, a pair of internal enhancer sites, the Escherichia coli HU protein, and divalent metal ions (Mg2+ or Mn2+) (see Mizuuchi(1992), Lavoie and Chaconas(1993), Wang and Harshey(1994), and Yang et al. (1995a, 1995b)). After the cleavage or nicking step of transposition, the cleaved Mu ends can be located within a stable high-order DNA-protein assembly called a “type I complex” (Fig. 1) (Surette et al., 1987). In the presence of Ca2+, an uncleaved synaptic complex (type 0 complex) accumulates in a reaction that also requires DNA supercoiling, the internal enhancer sequence, and HU protein for its formation and resembles the type I complex in harboring the tetramerized form of Mu A 1To avoid possible confusion, we refer to the first step in the kinetic scheme (Fig. 1) as type 0 complex formation, the second step as cleavage or conversion from type 0 to type I, and the overall reaction as type I complex formation. (see Fig. 1) (Mizuuchi et al., 1992; Surette and Chaconas, 1992). During a kinetic investigation of the role of DNA supercoiling in type I complex formation, we observed a dependence of the reaction rate on superhelical density as well as on the length of DNA outside Mu in the donor plasmid (Wang and Harshey, 1994). A strong temperature dependence (in the range of 15-35°C) was also observed, and a rather high activation enthalpy (67 ± 15 kcal/mol) was calculated for the reaction. These results could be well explained by a model in which the free energy of supercoiling is used directly to lower the activation barrier of a rate-limiting step. Our results implied the existence of an intermediate in which Mu ends have come together to allow domain closure, i.e. separation of Mu and non-Mu domains, the supercoiling energy from the non-Mu domain being utilized to promote the rate-limiting step of the reaction. We speculated that free energy from DNA supercoiling might be used to drive conformational changes of DNA, such as melting of the ends, and/or conformational changes of Mu A protein. In this study we show first that the uncleaved type 0 complex assembled in the presence of Ca2+ is likely a bona fide intermediate in formation of the type I complex. We present evidence suggestive of the presence of single-stranded DNA just outside the Mu ends in the type 0 complex and its dependence on DNA supercoils. Chloroquine phosphate, KMnO4, and MES 2The abbreviations used are: MES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidTLtwin loopL∗linear, single loop. were purchased from Sigma, P1 nuclease from Boehringer Mannheim, topoisomerase I from Life Technologies, Inc., and ΔTaq and Sequenase DNA sequencing kits from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Mu A and E. coli HU proteins were purified as described (Kuo et al., 1991). 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid twin loop linear, single loop. Plasmid pRA170 has been described (Leung et al., 1989; Wang and Harshey, 1994). pZW140 was derived from pRA170 by deleting a PvuII fragment in the trp-lac region within mini-Mu. The lengths of the Mu and non-Mu domains in this plasmid are similar (2 and 2.2 kilobases, respectively). Topoisomers of mini-Mu plasmids were prepared and analyzed as described earlier (Wang and Harshey, 1994). Kinetic assays for formation of the type I complex have been described (Wang and Harshey, 1994). Mu A and HU proteins were added to the mini-Mu donor plasmid in 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 130 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2, at indicated temperatures. Formation of the type 0 complex was assayed indirectly as follows. The complex was formed in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2 instead of MgCl2, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 μg/ml heparin. The complex was purified over a Bio-Gel P-100 spin column (spin dialysis) and cleaved by the addition of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 130 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2, followed by a 20-min incubation at room temperature. Cleavage reactions were terminated by the addition of either 20 mM EDTA or 0.2% SDS (final), and electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels in 1 × TAE buffer with 0.3 μg/ml EtBr. Conversion of type 0 to type I complex was assayed the same way, except that type 0 complexes were formed at 30°C for 10 minutes and the cleavage reaction was carried out for various times at the required temperature. In experiments using different metal ions, type 0 complexes were directly assayed according to the procedure recently described by Kim et al.(1995), where treatment of type 0 reaction mixtures with 10 μg/ml heparin before electrophoresis results in a distinct type 0 complex band, migrating just above the supercoiled donor plasmid. Type 0 and type I complexes that were passed over a Bio-Gel P-100 spin column were incubated with 50 ng/ml P1 nuclease in 20 mM MES, pH 6.5, for 20 min on ice. P1 digestion was stopped by the addition of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. In primer extension experiments designed to map P1 cleavages (see below), 25 ng/ml heparin was used to stop the reactions before spin dialysis. The mixtures were then extracted twice with phenol, and DNA was precipitated with 70% ethanol. Control DNA missing one or more of the reaction components in the initial kinetic reaction was treated in the same way. Approximately 2 μg of type 0 complex DNA was reacted with 4 mM KMnO4 at 20°C for 15 min in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA. DNA was spin dialyzed over a Sepharose CL-6B column pre-equilibrated with buffer, precipitated twice with ethanol, and dissolved in 100 μl of 1 M piperidine. Samples were heated at 90°C for 30 min and dried in vacuum with two to three changes of water. 0.2-0.5 μg of DNA was used for primer extension reactions. The sequences of the primers used are as follows: R3, AATGAATAAAAAGCAGT; RB, GGTTAATGTCATGATAATAA; L2, AGCTTCTTTCGCGTTTCATTGATTAACG; LT, CAGGAAGGCAAAATGCCGCA. Primer extension was carried out in two alternate ways. 1) Primers were first labeled with [γ-32P]ATP to a specific activity of ˜1 Ci/μmol. Reaction mixtures containing 1 μl (0.1 μg) of template DNA, 0.5 μl (0.5 μM) of labeled primer, and 1.9 units of ΔTaq polymerase in 30 mM Tris, pH 9.5, 7.5 mM MgCl2, were incubated at 90°C for 2 min and immediately cooled on ice. Next, 2 μl of extension mix (15 μM dNTP) was added, and incubation continued at 50°C for 20 min. DNA chain extension was stopped by the addition of 3.5 μl of formamide stop solution. The resulting DNA fragments were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. 2) Primers were extended using the Sequenase sequencing kit, with [35S]dATP to detect the extended primer chains. Reactions were stopped and analyzed as in method 1. DNA band intensities were quantitated using the NIH Image, version 1.55 software, as described by Wang and Harshey (1994). The type 0 complex has been implicated as an early reaction intermediate in the pathway leading up to Mu end cleavage and formation of the type I complex (Mizuuchi et al., 1992) (Fig. 1). In order to verify this postulate, we followed the time course of type 0 and type I complex formation and of the conversion (cleavage) of type 0 to type I. Note that, in these experiments, only the type I complex was assayed directly by measuring the fraction of the supercoiled DNA substrate cleaved by Mu A in presence of Mg2+. Formation of the type 0 complex and the conversion of the type 0 complex to type I were measured indirectly by generating the DNA-protein complex in the presence of Ca2+ and following DNA cleavage upon replacing Ca2+ with Mg2+. Details of the assays are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data from a typical kinetic experiment at 25°C are shown in Fig. 2. Under these assay conditions, where the DNA substrate was the only limiting reaction component, a pseudo-first-order reaction with respect to DNA is expected (Wang and Harshey, 1994). When the kinetic data were fitted with a pseudo-first-order equation (see Fig. 2 legend), we obtained an apparent rate constant of 0.38/min and 0.75/min for type 0 formation and for conversion from type 0 to type I, respectively. These two rate constants correspond to a half-time of 1.8 and 0.92 min for the two reactions, respectively. From the two rate constants calculated above, we computed a theoretical trace (Fig. 2, dotted line) for the time course of type I formation using the following standard equation for two irreversible, consecutive reactions of first order, [Type I]=S0[1+1k2-k1(k1e-k2t-k2e-k1t)](Eq. 1) where So is the starting concentration of substrate. The experimentally obtained kinetic data (open triangles) for the overall type I reaction showed a fairly good fit to the theoretical curve. It should be pointed out that the DNA substrates employed here, as isolated from E. coli, consist of different topoisomers and are thus kinetically heterogeneous. A rigorous quantitative analysis of the reaction scheme is therefore not strictly meaningful unless each individual topoisomer population is analyzed. Although large differences in the reaction rates among the DNA substrates is not expected here, given the average superhelicity of the plasmids (estimated to be −0.06), we still caution against the literal interpretation of the kinetic constants observed. We showed earlier that formation of the type I complex has a strong temperature dependence (Wang and Harshey, 1994). We were therefore interested in deciphering whether one of the two steps, formation of type 0, its conversion to type I (cleavage of type 0), or both exhibit temperature dependence. Fig. 3 shows the kinetics of one set of experiments at 20°C, analyzed as described above for the kinetics at 25°C (Fig. 2). The average half-times for type 0 formation were 6.3 ± 3.1 min (the number of experiments (n) = 8) at 20°C and 1.7 ± 0.8 min (n = 3) at 25°C, respectively; and those for conversion from type 0 to the type I complex were 2.9 ± 0.5 min (n = 5) at 20°C and 1.3 ± 0.3 min (n = 3) at 25°C. The average values for the overall type I reaction were 32 ± 7 min (n = 6) at 20°C and 5.0 ± 2.2 min (n = 3) at 25°C. We caution the reader against possible misinterpretation of the type 0 to type I conversion data in Fig. 3. The plateau of the kinetic curve represented by the filled circles denotes 100% conversion of type 0 to type I. The 40% value on the ordinate corresponds to the total yield of the type 0 complex (prior to cleavage) in this experiment. Recall that our assays measure type 0 indirectly following DNA cleavage. The validity of the interpretations based on this indirect estimate of type 0 has been verified by the subsequent development of a direct gel mobility assay for type 0 (Kim et al.(1995); see also Fig. 10). We note that the kinetics of type 0 formation (in the presence of Ca2+) or type I formation (in presence of Mg2+) show greater variability from experiment to experiment than the conversion of type 0 (formed in the presence of Ca2+) to type I in the presence of Mg2+. The reasons for this are not clear. One potential contributing factor is the nonuniform recovery of the type 0 complex from individual reaction mixtures using the “spin dialysis” protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nonetheless, the data from Figure 2:, Figure 3: reveal important rate-determining aspects of the strand cleavage reaction by the Mu A protein. First, the conversion of type 0 to type I is a fast reaction, showing only a modest rate acceleration with temperature (ratio of t1/2 values at 20 and 25°C is approximately 2). On the other hand, Ca2+-mediated formation of the type 0 complex or Mg2+-mediated formation of the type I complex are slower reactions that show markedly higher temperature-dependent rate enhancements (ratio of t1/2 values at 20 and 25°C is approximately 4 for the type 0 and approximately 6 for the type I reaction). Second, the significantly lower t1/2 for the type 0 reaction (Ca2+-mediated) compared with the type I reaction (Mg2+-mediated) at both 25 and 20°C suggests that the assembly of the precleavage synaptic complex (type 0) has a lower activation barrier in the presence of Ca2+ than in the presence of Mg2+. Thus we conclude that the strong temperature dependence of the type I reaction is contributed mainly by the step of assembling a complex equivalent to type 0. It should be noted that, despite the drop in the rate of type 0 formation upon temperature shift from 25 to 20°C, there was little change in the final yield of type 0 3The kinetics of type 0 formation at 30°C is too fast to be manually resolved. We estimate at least a 2-fold reduction in the rate constant when the temperature is lowered to 25°C. No change in the yield can be detected. (compare Fig. 2 with Fig. 3). All of the above results are consistent with a model in which the formation of a type 0 equivalent is the rate-limiting step of the overall strand cleavage reaction, at least for the DNA substrate tested here. The rate of type I formation varies with the superhelical density of the mini-Mu donor plasmid (Wang and Harshey, 1994). To see how the kinetics of type 0 production is influenced by superhelical density, we generated topoisomers of mini-Mu plasmid pZW140 as described previously (Wang and Harshey, 1994). Fig. 4 follows the kinetics of type 0 and type I formation with increasing superhelical density. The similarity between the two curves (open circles or open triangles) suggests that the dependence of type 0 formation on superhelicity parallels that of type I formation (notice the nearly identical slopes of the linear portions of the curves). It should be clarified that we do not expect the two curves to be identical. From the results shown in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, we already know that the kinetics of type 0 and type I reactions have inherent differences. Furthermore, it is possible that the degree of superhelicity of the DNA substrate may have an influence on the equilibrium of the reaction (see “Discussion”). Since we measure type 0 after converting it into type I, one might argue that the apparent dependence of type 0 formation on superhelicity is due to the requirement of supercoils during conversion of type 0 to type I complex. However, as shown below, supercoils appear not to be required for this conversion step. Thus, the demonstration that the kinetic dependence of the formation of type 0 on superhelicity parallels that of type I lends further support to the inference that the type 0 complex is a real intermediate in the type I reaction pathway. The results thus far strongly support the notion that the requirement for DNA supercoiling is crucial for type 0 complex formation. To test whether supercoils are also needed for the cleavage reaction, we used P1 nuclease to nick mini-Mu pZW140 DNA and thus release the supercoils in the Mu or non-Mu domain of the type 0 complex. (The choice of P1, as opposed to S1, was dictated by the observation that Zn2+ ions required for S1 activity were efficient at cleaving the type 0 complex (see below).) Although the optimal pH for P1 activity toward the denatured DNA is around 5.3, it has significant activity at neutral pH (Fujimoto et al., 1974). We first established that the kinetics of type I formation is not detectably different in the pH range of 6.5-8.0 (data not shown) and then chose pH 6.5 for P1 cleavage. Fig. 5 shows the results of experiments with type 0 using amounts of P1 just sufficient to relax supercoiled DNA. Under these conditions most of the type 0 complexes migrated at the relaxed position (lane 2), suggesting that type 0 complexes are not stable upon removal of supercoils. However, this instability appears to occur during electrophoresis within the gel rather than in the reaction mixture prior to fractionation. When P1 cleavage was followed by incubation with Mg2+, a significant fraction of the type 0 complexes could be converted to stable forms labeled TL (twin loop), L∗ (linear, single loop) and type I (lane 3). The TL band could be converted to a relaxed form upon SDS treatment and was found to carry specific nicks at both Mu ends as determined by primer extension experiments (not shown). We surmise that in the TL band the Mu ends are held together in a complex in which both the Mu and the non-Mu regions (of equivalent length in pZW140) are relaxed. This assignment is supported by the observation that relaxing the Mu domain of type I complexes with P1 produces a band that co-migrates at the TL position (lane 4). Thus, the TL species most likely resulted from Mu A protein cleavage of type 0 complexes in which the Mu domain was relaxed due to a P1 nick. (On naked supercoiled DNA two preferential P1 cleavage sites were found, one between Mu attL and enhancer region and the other in the vector plasmid sequences (data not shown). Neither of these cleavages was close to the ends of Mu (see Fig. 7)). The L∗ band could be converted to a linear form upon SDS treatment, and the restriction enzyme pattern of this species was consistent with a double strand cut near the left end of Mu (not shown). This species most likely resulted from Mu A protein cleavage (in the presence of Mg2+) of type 0 complexes in which P1 had nicked the non-Mu or vector domain close to the left Mu end, on the continuous strand (opposite the strand cleaved by Mu A) as confirmed in primer extension experiments described below.Figure 7:Superhelicity dependence of generation of the P1-sensitive region outside the left end of Mu in type 0 complexes. Type 0 complexes generated with plasmid pZW140 substrates of varying superhelicity were treated with P1 nuclease. Primer extension using the L2 primer was performed as in Fig. 6.

This result shows that substrate supercoiling is required only for assembling the cleavage-competent protein-DNA architecture (type 0) and not for the execution of the cleavage reaction per se. In order to determine the cleavage sites of P1 in the type 0 complexes, primer extensions were carried out by annealing appropriate primers to the template DNA. Fig. 6 shows the reactions. Primers L2 and LT were used to probe the top and bottom strands, respectively, at the left end of Mu, while RB and R3 were used to probe these at the right end (Fig. 6A). Specific P1 cleavage bands (Fig. 6B) were seen only in the type 0 complexes probed with primer L2 (lanes 2 and 3), on the continuous (top) strand outside the left end of Mu. Similar cleavages were not observed with this primer on naked DNA (not shown), on type 0 complexes untreated with P1 (lane 1), or in type I complexes (lanes 4 and 5). These cleavages extend from within Mu (+2 nucleotides) to 8 nucleotides outside Mu. Thus P1 cleaves on the strand opposite to the one destined to be cleaved by Mu A protein, outside the left end. No specific P1 cleavages were seen on strands probed with LT, R3 or RB primers (see lanes 2 in these panels). The only other cleavages observed in the type 0 complexes were those produced by Mu A protein subsequent to P1 treatment (bottom strand at the left end and top strand at the right end; lane 3 in LT and RB). Observe, however, that after P1 cleavage of type 0 complexes, only a fraction of the complexes could be cleaved by Mu A on the bottom strand at the left end (compare Mu A cleavage intensity in lane 3 versus lane 4 in panel LT). In contrast, cleavage at the right end by Mu A after P1 treatment was almost as efficient as seen in type I complexes (RB, compare band intensities of Mu A nick in lane 3 versus lane 4). This suggests that type 0 complexes treated with P1 nuclease were stable enough to complete Mu A cleavage, which occurred predominantly at the right end. We also observed that addition of HU protein to purified type 0 complexes inhibited P1 cleavage at the left end (data not shown), presumably because HU binds preferentially to this region to block P1 access to the site. P1 cleavage at the left end of Mu DNA is, presumably, due to the unpairing of the base pairs in this region. If the free energy of DNA supercoiling is utilized to promote this conformational transition, we should expect P1 cleavage at the left end to depend on superhelicity. Indeed, P1 cleavage, as revealed by primer extension experiments, showed the same degree of dependence on supercoils as formation of type 0 complex (Fig. 7; see also Fig. 4). Note that control DNA (unlabeled lane) did not show any specific cleavage in the region immediately outside the left Mu end. The dependence of P1 cleavage on superhelicity of type 0 complexes, which are not as yet cleaved by Mu A protein, is fully consistent with a model in which the formation of the type 0 complex is the rate-determining step in type I production. If P1 nuclease is indeed sensing the presence of single-stranded DNA outside the Mu ends in a type 0 complex, other single-strand specific probes should also detect such regions. We chose KMnO4, a smaller probe than P1 nuclease, which is reported to be a pyrimidine-specific reagent that oxidizes unpaired bases in DNA (Hayatsu and Ukita, 1967; Sasse-Dwight and Gralla, 1988). More recently, KMnO4 has also been found to modify purines in denatured DNA (Akman et al., 1990). Type 0 complexes were treated with KMnO4, the DNA cleaved at the modified sites, and the cleavage sites mapped by primer extension. In these experiments, KMnO4 cleavage sites are identified as polymerase stops across all four sequencing lanes (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results comparing KMnO4 cleavage of control DNA versus type 0 complexes are shown in Fig. 8. Cleavages were detected outside both ends of Mu, on both the top and bottom strands. However, the most extensive cleavages were detected on the continuous strands (top strand at left end (L2 primer), and bottom strand at right end (R3 primer)). At the right end, these extended from within Mu DNA (+2 nucleotides) to 8 nucleotides outside Mu, analogous to the P1 cleavages on the continuous or top strand outside the left end as seen in Fig. 6. At the left end, the KMnO4 cleavages overlapped and extended beyond the cleavages produced by P1. Fig. 9 summarizes the cleavage sites of P1 outside the left end (Figure 6:, Figure 7:), and KMnO4 outside both ends of Mu (Fig. 8) in type 0 complexes. We interpret the Mu end cleavages seen with these two single-strand specific probes as indicators of the generation of single-stranded DNA at both ends of Mu in the type 0 complex. While experimenting with removal of supercoils in the type 0 complex using S1 nuclease, we discovered that Zn2+ ions can cleave the type 0 complex. We therefore tested other transition metal ions Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Fe2+ for their ability to support cleavage of type 0 complexes. Of these, only Co2+ ions were seen to be effective. Fig. 10 compares the activity of Zn2+, Co2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ ions using a recently described gel assay, which directly monitors the formation of type 0 complexes (Kim et al.(1995); see “Experimental Procedures”). In a two-step cleavage reaction, where type 0 complexes were first assembled, purified over a gel filtration column (lane 2), and then incubated with the four indicated metal ions (lanes 3-6), all four were seen to convert type 0 to type I. Co2+ (lane 6) ions were as effective as Mg2+ (lane 3), while Zn2+ ions (lane 5) were less so. Mn2+ ions (as has been seen before), promote intramolecular strand transfer (lane 4, faster migrating band below the type I complex). The inter- or intramolecular strand transfer step of transposition was similarly supported by both Zn2+ and Co2+ (not shown). However, when type I complex formation was monitored directly in a one-step reaction, Zn2+ and Co2+ ions could not support either type 0 or type I formation (lanes 9 and 10), while Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions were efficient at type I (and hence type 0) formation (lanes 7 and 8). In this report, we have presented kinetic studies on the type 0 complex, its formation and conversion to type I complex. The kinetics of type 0 formation in the presence of Ca2+ fits well with the expectation that it precedes type I in the Mu A mediated DNA cleavage reaction (Fig. 2). The rate of production of type 0 and type I show close parallels in their dependence on temperature (Fig. 3) and on the superhelicity of the DNA substrate (Fig. 4). The simplest explanation for these observations is that type 0 complex is a bona fide intermediate in the pathway leading to the type I complex. Our results also suggest that the formation of the pre-cleavage synaptic complex (type 0 or type 0 equivalent) has a lower activation barrier in presence of Ca2+ than in presence of Mg2+ Furthermore, we find that the conversion of type 0 to type I complex is a relatively rapid reaction, and is fairly insensitive to temperature. Overall, these observations suggest that type 0 formation is the rate-limiting step in type I formation, at least for a DNA substrate with superhelicities at or below −0.06. Given that the formation of the type 0 complex is the rate-limiting step in generating the type I complex, the observed dependence of type 0 production on DNA superhelicity likely reflects a true rate dependence on supercoils. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that supercoiling may determine the equilibrium of the reaction as well. Indeed, if supercoils are used to elevate the energy level of the substrates, instead of lowering the energy level of the transition state, supercoiling will influence both the rate and equilibrium of type 0 complex formation. If formation of type 0 complex is already overwhelmingly favored, as seems to be the case for plasmids with a superhelicity near −0.06, further increase in superhelicity would result in no detectable difference in the yield but could lead to higher reaction rates. We had proposed that in the Mu transposition reaction, the free energy of supercoils might be used to promote energetically costly events such as the structural transition of DNA (e.g. melting) and/or of proteins (Wang and Harshey, 1994). It may well be that the target for Mu nicking is single- rather than double-stranded DNA. If Mu DNA ends must melt before they can be cleaved, then the supercoiling, in principle, could facilitate this event. We have now shown that DNA at the ends of Mu in the type 0 complex is susceptible to cleavage by single-strand-specific agents (nuclease P1 and KMnO4; Figure 6:, Figure 7:, Figure 8:, Figure 9:). Furthermore, P1 cleavage near the left end of Mu is dependent upon supercoils, and this dependence is correlated with formation of the type 0 complex (Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:). Cleavage of type 0 by P1 does not abolish cleavage by Mu A protein at the DNA ends (Fig. 5, 6), although we do not know whether the conformational changes in DNA, as detected by P1 nuclease and KMnO4, are removed along with the presumed removal of supercoils upon P1 cleavage. Since Mu A protein contacts DNA outside Mu in the type 0 complex (Mizuuchi et al., 1992), it is possible that the structural distortions within the type 0 remain after P1 cleavage, even though they may not be exactly the same. Both single strand DNA probes used in this study were seen to preferentially cleave the continuous strands of DNA (the strands not cleaved by Mu A) in type 0 complexes (see Fig. 9). These cleavages extended from 2 nucleotides within Mu to 8 nucleotides outside Mu. It is very likely that this specificity for the continuous strand is a result of protection of the complementary strand by Mu A protein. We note that although footprinting of type I complexes with DNase I and methidiumpropyl-EDTA•Fe(II) showed protection of 12-13 base pairs outside Mu ends (Lavoie et al., 1991; Mizuuchi et al., 1991), dimethyl sulfate modification experiments failed to reveal methylation protection of the continuous strands outside Mu (Kuo et al., 1991). It is not clear why P1 did not cleave DNA outside the right end of Mu, a region readily detected by KMnO4. This preference may be a result of preferential access of P1 to only the left end of Mu. Alternatively, the single-stranded features at the two ends are a result of structural distortions that are not equivalent. Of interest in this regard are results of hydroxyl radical footprinting of type I complexes, which showed enhanced cleavages 2 base pairs outside the Mu ends on the continuous or unnicked strands (Lavoie et al., 1991). However, the hydroxyl radical hyperreactivity was higher at the right end. The asymmetric DNA conformation outside the two ends of Mu as detected by the various DNA structure probes should not be surprising in view of the fact that, except for the two terminal base pairs at the ends of Mu, the sequence and arrangement of the att subsites (Mu A protein binding sites) are quite different at attL and attR (see Fig. 9) (Craigie et al., 1984; Zou et al., 1991). Also, the sequences outside the two Mu ends (in their integrated state on the host genome) are normally unrelated (except for the 5-base pair target duplication bordering each end). The asymmetry of DNA conformation outside the Mu ends may be of significance to the biology of phage Mu replication, which is thought to proceed asymmetrically, from the left to the right end of Mu (see Harshey(1988)). Further experiments are needed to explore the DNA structure in this region. We note that KMnO4 reacts not only with bases in denatured DNA but has also been reported to selectively react with B-Z or Z-Z junctions in supercoiled plasmid DNA (Jiang et al., 1991). Similarly, P1 nuclease is capable of recognizing a range of non-A/non-B/non-Z conformations in double-stranded DNA (see Pulleybank et al.(1988)). We conjecture that the single-stranded DNA regions in a type 0 complex may have specific interactions (such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions) with Mu A protein to stabilize the melted/distorted structure. This could account for the sequence preference exhibited by Mu A beyond the cleavage sites at the Mu ends (see Wu and Chaconas(1992)). However, considerable flexibility must exist to accommodate a variety of base combinations. We note that a change of even one hydrogen bonding interaction within the type 0 complex could have an apparently dramatic consequence for its stability. The type 0 complex formed with pZW140 has an apparent half-time of decay of ˜16 min at 30°C (expected to be around 90 min at room temperature; the decay rate was estimated by timed incubation of type 0 complex in the absence of divalent metal ions followed by quantitating the amount of type I complex generated after the addition of Mg2+). The average free energy for a hydrogen bond (or more precisely, the average free energy change for a hydrogen bond exchange), is about 1.2 kcal/mol (Fersht, 1987). Thus, change of a single hydrogen bond within the type 0 complex could extend its half-life to 12 h or shorten it to just 11 min at room temperature, on average. 4The change in the decay rate due to changes in interaction free energy within the complex, if contributing entirely to stability, can be calculated by the equation, f = exp(ΔG/RT), where ΔG is the change in free energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. For ΔG = 1.2 kcal/mol, f ≈ 8 at room temperature. If the rate-limiting step of type 0 formation is the opening of the DNA helix outside the Mu ends, then it is also reasonable to expect that the sequence of this DNA will influence the activation barrier to the transition state, and therefore the rate of type 0 formation (see Cantor and Schimmel(1980) and Murchie et al.(1992)). We have shown in this study that Zn2+ and Co2+ metal ions (in addition to Mg2+ and Mn2+) can support cleavage of the type 0 complex (Fig. 10). Divalent metal ions play a central role in phosphoryl transfer in nucleic acids. Structural analysis of E. coli alkaline phosphatase (Kim and Wyckoff, 1991) and of the Klenow polymerase (Beese and Steitz, 1991) complexed with a deoxynucleoside monophosphate and a single-stranded DNA substrate strongly suggest that two metal ions are liganded to specific amino acids. One metal ion is proposed to function as a Lewis acid and to form the attacking hydroxide ion, whereas a second metal ion is proposed to coordinate the bridging 3′-oxygen atom at the cleavage site, stabilizing the transition state and facilitating the leaving of the 3′-OH group. It is likely that metal ions play several roles in the Mu transposition reaction, including one similar to that postulated for the nuclease activity of the Klenow fragment (see Baker and Luo(1994) and Kim et al.(1995)). For example, the inability of Ca2+ ions to support cleavage of the type 0 complex suggests at least two roles for divalent cations, one in assembly of the complex and the other in cleavage (Mizuuchi et al., 1992). The ability of Zn2+ and Co2+ to support only cleavage but not formation of type 0 (Fig. 10), lends further credence to this notion. Metal ions such as cobalt, zinc, and copper can have differential, sequence-specific effects on DNA (see Kang and Wells(1994) and references cited therein). It is likely that during assembly, metal ions may play a role in promoting and/or stabilizing the altered DNA conformation in the type 0 complex. We have recently described the isolation of a mutant of Mu A that shows a differential response to different divalent cations (Kim et al., 1995). Mu A(G348D) was seen to assemble a type 0 complex only in the presence of Ca2+ (and not Mg2+ or Mn2+) and cleave a preassembled type 0 only in the presence of Mn2+ (and not Mg2+), but strand transfer precleaved Mu ends in the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+. All of these results suggest not only a multiple role for metal ions in Mu transposition, but also a different role in each of the three observable stages of transposition: assembly, cleavage, and strand transfer. The combination of variant proteins and metal ions should provide tools for the dissection of the role of metal ions in the various steps of the transposition reaction. We thank M. Jayaram for comments on the manuscript."

Homeostatically, it makes sense that each activating event in cells should be countered by a moderating reaction(s), although in the literature, descriptions of the former far exceed those of the latter. Thus, depending on context, activators should also frequently serve as repressors (reviewed in (58.Karin M. New Biol. 1990; 2: 126-131PubMed Google Scholar)). In HTLV-I, many aspects of disease pathogenesis suggest the existence of tight checks on viral activation function. Most notable is the fact that <5% of all infected individuals ultimately develop ATL and usually not before a latency period greater than 20-30 years(59.Hinuma Y. Komoda H. Chosa T. Kondo T. Kohakura M. Takenaka T. Kikuchi M. Ichimaru M. Yunoki K. Sato I. Matsuo R. Takiuchi Y. Uchino H. Hanaoka M. Int. J.

This contrasts sharply with the observed rapid and dramatic effects exerted by ectopic expression of HTLV-I proteins on cultured cells (discussed in (61.Majone F. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. Virology. 1993; 193: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)). Such juxtaposition of findings suggests the existence of yet characterized biological controls on viral activation. c-Myc is a 64-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in (62.Marcu K.B.

Understandably, tight control of Myc expression, which has been described at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (reviewed in (62.Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev.

In searching for cellular targets of HTLV-I Tax, we unexpectedly observed a novel interaction with Myc. When cells were transfected to express Tax, the nuclear detection by a monoclonal antibody directed to an N-terminal epitope of Myc was masked. This effect did not affect steady-state stability/amount of Myc since detection of protein using other antibodies was unchanged. While Tax has been shown previously to cooperate with oncogenes (e.g. ras) (69.Pozzatti R. Vogel J. Jay G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) in transformation, its ability to antagonize also a second oncoprotein through presumptive regulation at the level of local protein conformation is intriguing. We discuss the possible biological implications of this finding. Tax-expressing constructs have been described previously(19.Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1992; 66 (and references cited therein): 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 70.Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1827-1833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type Myc and Myc deletion constructs are described elsewhere(71.Chou E.Y. Dang C.V. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). MycΔ48-175 was constructed by digestion of wild-type Myc cDNA with SstI and religation to form the described in-frame deletion. This fragment was transferred to a glutathione S-transferase fusion vector for subsequent expression. Myc45-130 was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the appropriate fragment and subsequent placement into the same glutathione S-transferase fusion vector. HeLa and Rat1a cells and Rat1a derivatives were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mML-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The S49.1 derivative (B1R) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mML-glutamine, 10% horse serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Jurkat cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mML-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For immunofluorescence, HeLa cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells onto coverslips in 100-mm2 culture dishes. Calcium phosphate-mediated transfections were performed 24 h later as described previously(72.Graham F.L. Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice and then fed with 5 ml of medium 16 h after introduction of calcium phosphate precipitates. Cells were fixed 24 h later for microscopy. Transfection of suspension cells was achieved using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's suggestions. Following transfection, the cells were attached to polylysine-coated glass coverslips and processed for microscopy as described for adherent cells. HeLa cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/well onto 6-well tissue culture plates. Calcium phosphate-mediated transfections were performed as described above. Extracts were made by freeze-thawing and were assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity(73.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was quantitated on a Fujii phosphoimager after resolution of acetylated forms by thin-layer chromatography. All assays were performed within the linear range of enzymatic activity. Whole cell extracts were made by dissolving cell pellets in 2 × Laemmli buffer (74.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and boiling for 10 min. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation and then resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following separation, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Nonspecific sites were blocked by preincubation in BLOTTO(75.Johnson D.A. Gautsch J.W. Sportsman J.R. Elder J.H. Gene Anal. Tech. 1995; 1: 3-8Crossref Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Primary antibody was reacted with the filters overnight at 4°C in BLOTTO. The filters were then washed in 1% casein in PBS and incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Excess antibody was removed with extensive washes in 1% casein in PBS and visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocols (WesternLite, Tropix Inc.). Cells were seeded onto coverslips and transfected as described above. The adherent cells were fixed with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.0) for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with a 2-min wash in 100% MeOH at room temperature followed by a wash in 4% bovine serum albumin dissolved in PBS. All subsequent steps were performed in bovine serum albumin/PBS. Appropriately diluted primary antibody was incubated with coverslips overnight at 4°C. Excess antibody was removed with four washes in bovine serum albumin/PBS. Species-specific second antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate was then reacted with the coverslips for 1 h at room temperature with four subsequent washes in bovine serum albumin/PBS. The final samples were mounted onto slides and visualized using a Ziess Axiophot confocal microscope. The modulatory effects of Tax on various cellular genes have been extrapolated largely from chimeric reporter experiments and from cell-free biochemical assays. Direct characterization of Tax effects within intact cells has generally been difficult. To address this, we sought to visualize in situ interactions between Tax and endogenous transcription factors using confocal microscopy. We transfected cells with a Tax-expressing vector. Subsequently, the transfected cells were double-stained with anti-Tax rabbit serum (19.Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1992; 66 (and references cited therein): 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a collection of mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for selected cellular factors. Some of these factors colocalized with Tax 2O. J. Semmes and K.-T. Jeang, submitted for publication. ; and from one series of study, an unexpected interaction between Tax and c-Myc was observed. When Tax-expressing HeLa cells (Fig. 1A, arrow 1) were visualized using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody C-8, no Myc fluorescence was detected in the nucleus (Fig. 1B, arrow 1). In the same field, HeLa cells that did not express Tax stained brightly for c-Myc (Fig. 1B, arrow 2). This finding was reproduced in all other fields, and quantitation of fluorescent signals showed that Tax-expressing cells (Fig. 1C, trace 1) measured less than one-tenth the staining intensity of that seen in Tax-nonexpressing counterparts (Fig. 1C, trace 2). The epitope in c-Myc recognized by the C-8 monoclonal antibody was unknown. To check whether the disappearance of Myc fluorescence was due to a reduction in steady-state protein or was a result of epitope masking, two other Myc-specific antibodies were tested. Anti-Myc C-33 is a monoclonal antibody directed to an epitope different from C-8, although this reactivity has also not been mapped (Fig. 1E). Anti-Myc 9E10 recognizes amino acids 408-439 (Fig. 1G). When a population of HeLa cells transfected with a Tax vector was costained with anti-Tax and either C-33 or 9E10, clear images of c-Myc appeared in the nucleus, regardless of whether the cell expressed Tax protein or not (Fig. 1, compare arrowed cells in D and E and those in F and G). These findings contrasted with those obtained using the C-8 monoclonal antibody and suggested that Tax expression did not perturb steady-state Myc levels, but instead masked detection of one antigenic epitope. To better understand this masking, we mapped the epitope recognized by the C-8 monoclonal antibody. Wild-type and 10 mutant proteins that contained selected amino acid deletions were expressed in Escherichia coli (Fig. 2A). This panel of 11 Myc polypeptides was probed with C-8 in immunoblot assays. The results revealed that MycΔ1-48 and MycΔ106-143 were reactive to C-8, while MycΔ48-175 was not (Fig. 2A). Further analysis revealed that an expressed peptide (silver staining of proteins (Fig. 2B, left) and immunoblotting of same proteins (Fig. 2B, right)) containing only amino acids 45-130 was recognized by C-8 (Fig. 2B, lane 8), deductively narrowing the epitope to amino acids 45-105. Of interest, we note that amino acids 45-105 are wholly contained within the previously characterized transcriptional activation domain of Myc (reviewed in (76.Dang C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 103-113PubMed Google Scholar)). Tax interference with the nuclear detection of the N-terminal Myc activation domain suggested functional significance. Possibly, some aspect of Myc function is perturbed in the presence of Tax. Because singular overexpression of Myc confers anchorage-independent growth to Rat1a cells(77.Small M.B. Hay N. Schwab M. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1638-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we selected for Rat1a cells that ectopically overexpress Myc and Tax and assessed their growth phenotype. Starting with parental Rat1a cells (R1aH), using hygromycin selection, cells that express Myc (RM8), Myc + Tax (RM8X), or Myc + an inactive Tax mutant (RM8XG320(19.Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1992; 66 (and references cited therein): 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) were established (Fig. 3). Tax protein in cells was verified by both immunofluorescence (Fig. 3A) and immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). RM8X and RM8XG320 cells were found to express Tax, while R1aH and RM8 did not (Fig. 3, A and B). For Myc expression, similar amounts (after normalizing for background protein intensities) were detected for RM8 (Fig. 3D, lane 2), RM8X (lanes 3 and 4), and RM8XG320 (lanes 5 and 6). The lower level of endogenous Myc was not visualized clearly in R1aH cells (Fig. 3D, lane 1) by this assay. Overall, the immunoblots are consistent with the complementary immunofluorescent images shown in Fig. 1, confirming that Tax does not affect steady-state Myc levels. The four established cell lines were assayed also for anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 3C). When plated into soft agar, control R1aH cells (Myc−/Tax−) failed to form significant colonies (Fig. 3C). RM8 (Myc+/Tax−), consistent with previous findings (77.Small M.B. Hay N. Schwab M. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1638-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), produced many large foci (Fig. 3C). RM8XG320 (Myc+/inactive Tax(19.Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1992; 66 (and references cited therein): 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) resembled RM8 in also producing many large colonies. However, RM8X (Myc+/Tax+) (Fig. 3C), which expressed both Myc and Tax, showed much reduced cell masses in agar. One interpretation of these results is that Tax, perhaps as a consequence of epitope masking, repressed the induction by Myc of anchorage independence in cells. We caution that our findings do not eliminate the possibility that Tax has other more general effects on the cells, thereby reducing proliferative capacity. Myc activates transcription from responsive promoters. A contribution of the transcriptional activity of Myc to cellular transformation has been suggested (reviewed in (76.Dang C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 103-113PubMed Google Scholar)). That the N-terminal activation domain of Myc (66.Kato G.J. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5914-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 71.Chou E.Y. Dang C.V. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 759-763PubMed Google Scholar) is perhaps conformationally altered in cells that express HTLV-I Tax prompted us to examine what effect, if any, Tax has on Myc-modulated transcription. To explore this issue, we introduced into CV-1 cells chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmids that contained either tandem Myc-binding sites (MLPCAT) (Fig. 4, top) or two point-mutated Myc-binding sites (MLPDMCAT) (Fig. 4, bottom), with a Myc expression vector (RSVmyc), and/or a Tax expression vector (Tax), and/or a mutant Tax expression vector (TaxD). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities were determined 48 h later. As expected, we observed that MLPCAT was activated significantly by RSVmyc (Fig. 4, top). Interestingly, this stimulation was abolished when Tax was coexpressed (Fig. 4, top). In contrast, cointroduction of a plasmid expressing an inactive Tax mutant (TaxD) did not affect Myc activation of MLPCAT, controlling for functional specificity. As additional controls, we replicated the transfections using instead plasmid reporter MLPDMCAT (Fig. 4, bottom) that contained mutated Myc-responsive elements. In this instance, promoter expression was not influenced by coexpression of Myc, Tax, or Myc + Tax. These findings demonstrate that intact Myc-binding sites are necessary for activation and that functional Tax protein repressed this activation. Tax activates gene expression pleiotropically using at least two major signal transduction pathways defined by either NF-κB or CREB/ATF (reviewed in (8.Smith M.R. Greene W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and (10.Sodroski J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 19-29PubMed Google Scholar)). Previously, we (19.Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1992; 66 (and references cited therein): 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and others (80.Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) have delineated separate domains within Tax that specify interaction with either NF-κB or CREB/ATF."

https://openalex.org/W2071251275,"We have previously reported specific labeling of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase by the ATP affinity analog pyridoxal 5′-diphospho-5′adenosine (PLP-AMP), which resulted in inhibition of ATP-dependent reactions. The analog was found to be covalently bound at Lys103 and Lys110 on the gyrase B subunit (Tamura, J. K., and Gellert, M.(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21342-21349). In this study, the importance of these two lysine residues is examined by site-directed mutagenesis.Substitutions of Lys103 result in the loss of ATP-dependent functions.

The ATP-independent functions of gyrase, such as relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA and oxolinic acid-induced cleavage of double-stranded DNA, are unaffected by these mutations, suggesting that the mutant B subunits are assembling correctly with the A subunits. Gyrase with substitutions of Lys110 retains all activities. However, the affinity of ATP is decreased. The DNA supercoiling activity of gyrase A2B2 tetramers reconstituted with varying ratios of inactive mutant and wild-type gyrase B subunits is consistent with a mechanism of DNA supercoiling that requires the interdependent activity of both B subunits in ATP binding and hydrolysis.

In the absence of ATP, DNA gyrase relaxes negatively, but not positively, supercoiled DNA. In contrast, eukaryotic and T-even phage type II topoisomerases, which are structurally related to DNA gyrase (4.Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Ikeda H. Oguro M.

The topoisomerase reactions of all type II enzymes involve the passage of a double-stranded DNA segment through a transient double-strand break, which is then resealed to give changes in the DNA linking number in steps of two. DNA gyrase from Escherichia coli contains two subunits, A (GyrA) 1The abbreviations used are: GyrADNA gyrase A proteinGyrBDNA gyrase B proteinPLP-AMPpyridoxal 5′-diphospho-5′-adenosineADPNP5′-adenylyl-β,103-imidodiphosphate. and B (GyrB), which are assembled in an A2B2 complex(6.Klevan L.

The mechanism of energy coupling between ATP hydrolysis and DNA supercoiling is largely unknown. Limited supercoiling of relaxed closed circular DNA occurs upon the binding of ADPNP, suggesting that conformational changes associated with nucleotide binding can induce one supercoiling event while catalytic supercoiling requires hydrolysis of ATP and dissociation of products(15.Sugino A. Higgins N.P. Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 16.Tamura J.K. Bates A.D. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9214-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once formed, the gyrase-DNA-ADPNP complex does not readily dissociate. Binding of ADPNP to a gyrase-DNA complex is slow, and involves cooperative interactions between the two nucleotide binding sites in the gyrase tetramer(16.Tamura J.K. Bates A.D. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9214-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of only one of these sites appears to inhibit both ATP hydrolysis and DNA supercoiling(13.Tamura J. Gellert M. J.

In this work, we introduce mutations into GyrB at Lys103 and Lys110 and study the effects of these changes on the ATP-dependent and ATP-independent reactions of DNA gyrase. Evidence is presented indicating that Lys103, which is not conserved in the equivalent region of the eukaryotic type II topoisomerases, is essential for the ATP-dependent activities of gyrase. Results of supercoiling experiments combining wild-type and Lys103 mutant GyrB subunits in the reconstituted enzyme are discussed in terms of a mechanism requiring participation by both nucleotide binding sites of the gyrase A2B2 tetramer.

Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis and sequencing primers were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems model 380B DNA synthesizer. DNA sequencing was performed using Sequenase Version 2.0 from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Specific amino acid substitutions in E. coli GyrB were made by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using M13mp9gyrB single strand template DNA and a kit supplied by Amersham Corp. Oligonucleotides were designed to introduce only the desired amino acid substitution while in most cases also creating a new restriction site for rapid screening of clones (Table 1). The presence of the required base changes was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing of the purified single-stranded phage DNAs grown in TG1 cells. The double-stranded replicative forms of the phage DNAs were also prepared and the 428-base pair XmaI/NcoI restriction fragments containing the mutations were used to replace the wild-type XmaI/NcoI fragment in pAG111. After transformation into DH5αF′IQ™, the mutant plasmids were screened by restriction endonuclease digestion for the presence of intact insert ends, and for the newly created restriction sites where applicable. Plasmids meeting these criteria were then sequenced over the entire 428-base pair insert region to ensure that no other changes had taken place.Table 1 Open table in a new tab DH5αF′IQ™ cells carrying wild-type or altered pAG111 were grown, induced with isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and harvested as described by Hallett et al.(18.Hallett P.

The second peak, which had a greater amount of GyrB protein but low specific activity, eluted at 0.3 M NaCl. Fractions comprising the 0.2 M NaCl GyrB peak of the heparin-agarose column for each preparation were used in the subsequent DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. Supercoiling assays of GyrB variants were performed in the presence of GyrA as described by Mizuuchi et al.(19.Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9199-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA relaxation was assayed under the same conditions as supercoiling, except that ATP was omitted and negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA was substituted for relaxed DNA. Quinolone-induced cleavage of DNA was performed under supercoiling assay conditions except that EcoRI-digested linear pBR322 was used instead of relaxed DNA, oxolinic acid (Sigma) was added at 0.05 mg/ml, and ATP was either omitted or added at 1.1 mM. Cleavage assays were terminated by addition of 0.2% SDS and 0.08 mg/ml proteinase K (Beckman) and further incubated for 30 min at 37°C ATPase activity was measured using two methods. The first followed 32Pi liberation from [103-32P]ATP in a reaction containing 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 24 mM KCl, 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 6 mM MgCl2, 6.5% (w/v) glycerol, 1.8 mM spermidine, 5 mM dithiothreitol (buffer 1) and 0.4 mM [103-32P]ATP. Additions to selected assay samples included 33 μg/ml novobiocin, 15 μg/ml linear pBR322 DNA, and 10 μg/ml GyrA protein. The reactions were initiated by addition of 5 μg/ml GyrB protein. After a 1-h incubation at 25°C the reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 mM EDTA. Hydrolysis products were separated by thin-layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Bakerflex) developed in 0.8 M acetic acid, 0.8 M LiCl. The dried plates were then exposed to Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film. The second method, for kinetic studies of DNA-dependent ATPase activity, was an ATP-regenerating spectrophotometric assay used as described previously(13.Tamura J. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21342-21349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent values for Km and kcat were determined from double reciprocal plots of the turnover rate for ATP hydrolysis against the concentration of ATP (0.1-1.0 mM). Prior to the assay, 1.2 μM GyrA, 1 μM GyrB, 50 μg/ml linear pUC9 DNA, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were preincubated for 1 h at room temperature in buffer 1. ATPase reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of enzyme to 90 μl of the ATPase assay mixture. Binding studies using ADPNP (Sigma) and [α-32P]ADPNP (ICN) were carried out as described elsewhere(16.Tamura J.K. Bates A.D. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9214-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutations were made in GyrB protein residues Lys103 and Lys110, which were previously shown to be specifically labeled by the ATP analog, PLP-AMP(13.Tamura J. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21342-21349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions at Lys103 were threonine (K103T), isoleucine (K103I), and glutamic acid (K103E). At Lys110, the amino acid substitutions were valine (K110V) and glutamic acid (K110E). Wild-type and mutant GyrB proteins were expressed in E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells producing the Lys110 GyrB mutants grew at the same slow rate as those producing the wild-type protein. On the other hand, cells producing the Lys103 mutants grew more rapidly, indicating that excess production of the Lys103 mutants may be less toxic to the cells than overproduction of the wild-type GyrB protein. Expression of all of the GyrB proteins was very high, averaging about 30% of the total cell protein. However, based on the supercoiling assay, the specific activity of the wild-type GyrB protein in the cell lysate was much lower than expected. Further investigation led to the finding that wild-type GyrB protein could be resolved into two peaks, which eluted at 0.2 and 0.3 M NaCl on a heparin-agarose column. The first peak had a much higher specific supercoiling activity than the second, which may largely consist of improperly folded protein. Wild-type GyrB prepared from a strain carrying the same plasmid as used here was previously found to contain a large amount of low-activity protein, which showed increased activity after renaturation from guanidine hydrochloride solution(12.Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All of the mutant GyrB proteins were similarly partitioned into two peaks on heparin-agarose columns. DEAE-Sepharose chromatography of the more active wild-type peak fractions produced a nearly homogenous GyrB preparation with a specific activity close to that previously reported(19.Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9199-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This wild-type GyrB and corresponding DEAE-Sepharose fractions containing the mutant GyrB proteins were used for the experiments which follow. To ensure that the mutated forms of GyrB were still able to form a complex with GyrA, we tested the ATP-independent activities of the enzyme. Quinolone antibiotic drugs, such as oxolinic acid, interfere with the DNA breakage-reunion activity of DNA gyrase by trapping the covalent DNA-protein intermediate. Subsequent treatment with SDS and proteinase K results in double-strand breaks in the DNA(20.Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4772-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 21.Sugino A. Peebles C.L. Kreuzer K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). This cleavage activity occurs in the absence of ATP, as does the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA. Both activities can only be supported by the enzyme A2B2 tetramer and not by GyrA or GyrB alone. The ability of the enzymes containing mutant GyrB proteins to catalyze these ATP-independent reactions would indicate proper formation of the enzyme tetramer. The results in Fig. 1 show that in the absence of ATP, the wild type and all of the mutant enzymes were equally capable of promoting oxolinic acid-induced DNA cleavage. Similarly, all of the mutants completely retained the capacity to relax negatively supercoiled DNA (data not shown). Studies of the ATP-dependent activities show interesting differences between amino acid substitutions at positions 103 and 110 of GyrB. The K103E and K103I enzymes showed no detectable levels of supercoiling activity; the activity of K103T was reduced 500-fold. On the other hand, both K110V and K110E gyrases had specific activities for supercoiling that were only slightly less than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). However, with high enzyme/DNA ratios and longer incubations, the limit of negative supercoiling reached by these mutants was less than that of wild-type GyrB, as visualized by chloroquine gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Increasing the ATP concentration to 5.4 mM (added as Mg•ATP) did not increase the supercoiling limit for the Lys110 mutant enzymes (data not shown). The ATPase reaction of gyrase reconstituted with K110V and K110E GyrB subunits was investigated using a spectrophotometric assay. A double reciprocal plot of the results is presented in Fig. 3. The Kmapp for ATP of the wild-type enzyme control is 0.24 mM, in good agreement with previously reported values(13.Tamura J. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21342-21349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Sugino A. Higgins N.P. Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, the Kmapp values for K110V and K110E (1.4 mM and 1.1 mM, respectively), are severalfold higher than for wild-type, suggesting that these mutations decrease the affinity for ATP. The kcatapp values for wild-type, K110V, and K110E enzymes are 2.7, 2.3, and 1.3 s−1, respectively. Similar analyses of the Lys103 mutants were not performed because the ATPase activities were below the detection limits of the assay. Using a more sensitive radioactive assay (see “Experimental Procedures”), the effects of the various mutations on the hydrolysis of [103-32P]ATP were studied. The K103E, K103I, or K103T GyrB proteins had very low levels of ATPase activity, either in the presence or absence of GyrA and DNA. This residual ATP hydrolysis was largely insensitive to novobiocin suggesting that most, if not all, of the activity can be attributed to contaminating ATPases in the preparations. In assays using the K110V or K110E enzymes, DNA-dependent novobiocin-sensitive ATPase activity was observed at levels 2-3-fold lower than with the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). In the presence of oxolinic acid, there is a slight enhancement by ATP of DNA cleavage efficiency, and an accompanying change in cleavage site preference is seen with the wild-type, K110V, or K110E enzymes. In contrast, ATP had no effect on cleavage by the mutants K103T, K103E, and K103I (Fig. 1). A change in the DNA cleavage site preference in the presence of ATP is thought to be the result of a conformational change in the enzyme due to ATP binding(22.Morrison A. Higgins N.P. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2211-2219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of ADPNP, DNA gyrase can introduce limited negative supercoiling into a relaxed closed-circular DNA substrate(15.Sugino A. Higgins N.P. Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 16.Tamura J.K. Bates A.D. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9214-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both of the Lys110 mutants were able to carry out this limited ADPNP-dependent supercoiling while no such activity was detected in all three Lys103 mutants (data not shown). Is the loss of ATP-dependent functions for the Lys103 mutants due to their inability to bind nucleotides? We addressed this question by utilizing spin columns to test the enzymes for their ability to bind ADPNP (Fig. 4). After 5 h at 25°C, both Lys110 mutant GyrB proteins bound ADPNP at about 50% of the wild type level. We have previously reported a small increase in the rate of ADPNP binding to GyrB in the presence of GyrA and DNA(16.Tamura J.K. Bates A.D. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9214-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 80% increase in ADPNP bound to the GyrB in the wild-type A2B2-DNA complex after 5 h is consistent with this enhanced binding rate. However, with the Lys110 mutants, there is little or no increase in ADPNP binding in the presence of GyrA and DNA; after 5 h, ADPNP bound to the mutant A2B2-DNA complexes is only about 28% of the wild-type level. This value increased to approximately 55-60% after 25 h. In contrast, negligible amounts of bound ADPNP were detected on the Lys103 mutants even after 25 h in the presence of GyrA and DNA. Therefore, Lys103 appears to be essential for nucleotide binding. Since we have demonstrated that the Lys103 mutants of GyrB can assemble with GyrA to form a complex capable of catalyzing ATP-independent reactions, we were able to examine whether catalytic DNA supercoiling requires one or two active GyrB subunits in the A2B2 tetramer. The DNA supercoiling activity was measured using gyrase tetramers reconstituted with varying ratios of wild-type and mutant (K103I) GyrB proteins. This experiment requires the following assumptions: 1) GyrB proteins exist as monomers in solution and 2) association of the mutant and wild-type GyrB proteins with GyrA proteins is a random process, with no selective mechanism favoring formation of enzyme A2B2 tetramers with two wild-type or two mutant GyrB subunits. Cross-linking studies of purified GyrB protein from Micrococcus luteus have shown no higher order complexes, suggesting that the GyrB protein is indeed monomeric in solution(6.Klevan L. Wang J.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5229-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recent work using a 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of GyrB from E. coli showed that this protein is also a monomer, although it forms a dimer in the presence of ADPNP (11.Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of mixed gyrase tetramers in the absence of nucleotide should yield predictable proportions of enzyme containing two active GyrB subunits, two inactive GyrB subunits, and one of each. Fig. 5 shows the result of the reconstitution experiment. Included in the figure are three theoretical curves, each predicting a different outcome depending on the mechanism. The straight line (curve 1) is subject to two interpretations. First, curve 1 represents the anticipated results if the GyrB protein in solution is already a dimer or if assembly is not random but strongly favors two GyrB subunits of the same type per tetramer. Tetramers containing one active and one inactive GyrB monomer would be unlikely to form; the specific supercoiling activity of the wild-type enzyme would be simply diluted. Alternately, curve 1 would also be obtained if tetramers containing one inactive and one active B monomer are formed, but the activity of the mixed tetramer is proportional to the active GyrB content; that is, a mixed tetramer would have half the activity of a tetramer containing two active B subunits. The upper curve (curve 2) predicts the results if assembly of the gyrase tetramers is random, and catalytic supercoiling can occur with enzyme having one active and one inactive GyrB subunit; it is assumed that an enzyme tetramer containing only one active GyrB subunit has full catalytic activity. This result could also be achieved if a conformational change following ATP binding to the active GyrB subunit of a mixed tetramer promoted ATP binding at the inactive GyrB of the tetramer despite the inactivating Lys103 mutation, thus generating a second active site. Last, the lower curve (curve 3) represents the predicted outcome for random assembly into tetramers when enzyme containing two active GyrB subunits is the only species capable of catalyzing DNA supercoiling. The data points are in close agreement with curve 3, in strong support of the model that DNA supercoiling requires the participation of both ATP binding sites in the enzyme A2B2 complex. ATP-dependent type II topoisomerases possess an amino acid sequence motif predictive of ATP binding. This motif, a highly conserved glycine-rich region (residues 114-119 of GyrB from E. coli) of the sequence GXXGXG, is found in all known bacterial, phage, and eukaryotic type II topoisomerases (Table 2). This region, which is also found on a variety of other ATP binding proteins, has been postulated to form part of a flexible loop structure involved in conformational changes following nucleotide binding(23.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar, 24.Mildvan A.S. Fry D.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1987; 59: 241-313PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Serrano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). A possible role in nucleotide binding for the region of GyrB comprising amino acids 103-119 was initially proposed from the results of affinity labeling studies, in which Lys103 and Lys110 were specifically modified(13.Tamura J. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21342-21349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of this region was shown in more detail in the crystal structure of a 43-kDa N-terminal domain of GyrB containing bound ADPNP(14.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The structure shows that residues 96-117 form a loop followed by a short helix composed of residues 118-126. The phosphates of the bound nucleotide are in contact with glycines 114, 117, and 119 of the ATP-binding motif at the base of the helix. Furthermore, the ε-amino group of Lys103 forms a salt bridge with the β-phosphate of the bound ADPNP molecule, and Tyr109 forms a hydrogen bond with N3 of the adenine ring. When the amino acid sequence of E. coli GyrB residues 96-127 is compared with the corresponding region of all other bacterial GyrB proteins for which sequences have been determined, a very high degree of conservation is found. A separate comparison of these regions from the eukaryotic type II topoisomerases also shows very high sequence homology. However, comparing the gyrases to the eukaryotic enzymes reveals variations in this region which may be significant (Table 2). The sequences of residues 96-104 are quite different in the two classes of enzyme; in particular, the Gly101 and Gly102 residues of gyrase, which should contribute to the flexibility of the loop, are replaced by serine, and Lys103, which is conserved in all GyrB species, is replaced by asparagine in all of the eukaryotic type II topoisomerases. The Tyr109 residue found in all GyrB proteins is replaced by lysine, glutamine or serine in the eukaryotic type II topoisomerases. Lys110 is commonly found in enzymes from both groups; however, substitutions at this position have been identified in both gyrases and eukaryotic type II topoisomerases. Mutation of the corresponding lysine to alanine in yeast topoisomerase II had little effect on the activity(26.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in eukaryotic type II topoisomerases, neither the equivalent of Lys103 nor of Lys110 is required. It is interesting that this segment of E. coli ParE, a component of bacterial topoisomerase IV, very closely resembles GyrB in overall sequence, while the phage T2 and T4 gene 39 proteins include characteristics of both gyrase and eukaryotic type II topoisomerase. Like gyrase, topoisomerase IV and the T-even phage type II topoisomerases are multimers of two or more different subunits, but they resemble the homodimeric eukaryotic type II topoisomerases in activity.Table 2 Open table in a new tab Our present results suggest that Lys103 is essential for the ATP-dependent activities of DNA gyrase. Mutations at this site resulted in loss of these functions but did not affect ATP-independent activities. The ADPNP binding results, along with the implication of Lys103 in nucleotide binding from the crystal structure, support the hypothesis that it is the ability to bind ATP which is lost. However, we have previously proposed that ATP and its analog ADPNP initially form a rapidly reversible complex with gyrase, followed by a conformational change to a tightly bound state (16.Tamura J.K. Bates A.D. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9214-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that mutations at Lys103 do not altogether prevent nucleotide binding, but prevent or alter the conformational changes that follow; our spin column assay for ADPNP binding may not detect bound ADPNP if dissociation of the initial complex is very fast. We can nevertheless conclude that these substitutions at Lys103 alter the nucleotide binding behavior of gyrase in such a way that little or no tightly bound enzyme-nucleotide complex is formed and binding cannot be demonstrated by the methods previously used with the wild-type enzyme. The mutations of Lys110 indicate that this residue is not directly involved in ATP binding. Enzyme reconstituted with GyrB containing valine or glutamic acid substituted for Lys110 retains all activities of gyrase. However, the increase in the Kmapp for ATP of these mutants, together with the reduced level of ADPNP binding, suggests that ATP binds with lower affinity. The Kmapp and kcatapp values must be interpreted with caution; cooperative binding of two nucleotide molecules to the two binding sites in each gyrase tetramer, leading to conformational changes in the protein prior to hydrolysis(11.Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 16.Tamura J.K. Bates A.D. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9214-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Maxwell A. Rau D.C. Gellert M. Sharma R.H. Sharma M.H. Proceedings of the Fourth Conversation in Biomolecular Stereodynamics III. Adenine Press, New York1986: 137-146Google Scholar) casts doubt upon the validity of a steady-state approach to gyrase kinetics. However, by using gyrase as the preformed A2B2-DNA complex and holding the concentration of this complex constant, we obtain apparent parameters for the wild-type and mutant GyrB proteins which provide a useful means for comparing their relative ATPase activities. Ali et al.(11.Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) have proposed that the rate-limiting step for the ATPase activity of gyrase is not nucleotide binding, but hydrolysis and release of products. However, if the rate of nucleotide binding is considerably slower for the Lys110 mutants, as suggested by Fig. 4, then ATP binding may become rate-limiting. The binding rate of ADPNP to the wild-type gyrase-DNA complex has recently been found to be dependent on the topology of the substrate DNA, with binding being more rapid if the DNA is negatively supercoiled(28.Bates A.D. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1408-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This increase in nucleotide binding rate at higher levels of supercoiling may be less pronounced with the Lys110 mutants. It is therefore possible that with these mutants the ATP-independent DNA relaxation activity would make a greater contribution to the equilibrium superhelical density (Fig. 2). Our results on the Lys110 mutants are consistent with the structural information on the 43 kDa fragment of GyrB which shows that Lys110 does not form contacts with bound ADPNP(14.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). It is probable that amino acid substitutions for Lys110 cause a slight perturbation of the protein conformation involved with ATP binding or subunit interactions. This is not surprising in view of the close proximity of Lys110 to residues known to interact with ATP such as Tyr109, Gly114, Gly117, and Gly119. The Lys103 mutants have provided a unique tool for obtaining gyrase A2B2 tetramers containing a predictable distribution of active and inactive GyrB subunits. They offer an alternative to partial inactivation using nucleotide analogs or other inhibitors which might themselves cause or prevent conformational changes when bound to the protein, perhaps blocking interactions between the active and inactivated subunits. We have exploited the fact that the GyrB mutants at Lys103, while devoid of ATP-dependent reactions when reconstituted with GyrA and DNA, appear to retain the capacity to assemble into an enzyme complex capable of carrying out ATP-independent reactions. In the analysis, it was assumed that wild-type and mutant GyrB proteins in a mixture can assemble randomly and equivalently into the enzyme A2B2 complex. The observed supercoiling activities closely follow the predicted theoretical curve of a mechanism in which both GyrB subunits must be functional in ATP binding and hydrolysis to catalyze DNA supercoiling. The interdependent action of the two ATP binding sites in DNA supercoiling by gyrase has been previously proposed. Thermodynamic calculations of the free energy change required to decrease the DNA linking number by two at the high-supercoiling limit of gyrase action are consistent with the concerted hydrolysis of two molecules of nucleotide(29.Horowitz D.S. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 30.Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 31.Bates A.D. Maxwell A. EMBO. J. 1989; 8: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32.Cullis P.M. Maxwell A. Weiner D.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9642-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, measurements of the inhibition of ATPase and DNA supercoiling activities of gyrase following reaction with the ATP affinity reagent, PLP-AMP, indicate that modification of only one of the two ATP binding sites can lead to inactivation(13.Tamura J. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21342-21349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cooperative model for ATP binding was proposed based on the rates of ADPNP binding in the presence of ATP(16.Tamura J.K. Bates A.D. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9214-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model predicts the interdependence of the GyrB subunits for catalyzing ATP-driven reactions and agrees well with the present results from the subunit mixing experiments. Lastly, there is structural information which supports the functional interaction of the two ATP binding sites. The crystal structure of the N-terminal fragment of GyrB with ADPNP bound shows that the fragment exists as a dimer with dyad symmetry(14.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Each subunit contains an N-terminal extension that goes from close proximity to one nucleotide binding site to direct contact with the bound nucleotide on the other subunit. The physical contact between the two subunits provides a possible way of coupling ATP hydrolysis at one site to the participation of the ATP binding site on the other subunit. Related studies of the yeast type II topoisomerase have come to different though not necessarily contradictory conclusions. ATP binding to the two ATPase sites of the DNA-bound homodimer of this enzyme appears to be cooperative(26.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At low ATP concentrations, at which the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to relaxation activity is most efficient, an average of 1.9 ± 0.5 ATP molecules are hydrolyzed for each DNA transport event(26.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in a yeast heterodimer consisting of one wild-type subunit and one mutant allele defective in ATP binding, binding of ADPNP resulted in a concerted conformational change in both wild-type and mutant subunits(26.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 34.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 749-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35.Huang W.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 201-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that binding only one ATP to an enzyme dimer might suffice to drive a DNA transport event. However, strand-passage activity by the heterodimer was not studied. Further comparison of the yeast heterodimer with our present work is complicated because the inactivating mutation at Gly144 of yeast topoisomerase II does not correspond to Lys103 of gyrase, but to Gly117 in the gyrase ATP binding motif. It remains possible that in a Gly117 gyrase mutant an induced conformational change similar to that seen in the yeast topoisomerase II mutant/wild type heterodimer would be found.

To obtain structural information on these intermediates, two of the three Trp residues in the protein were changed to Phe to generate a set of three single Trp mutant enzymes. These mutant enzymes were purified and characterized and shown to retain essentially all of the properties of the wild-type enzyme. The fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements of each mutant enzyme were studied under unfolding-refolding equilibrium conditions and during refolding. In addition, the sensitivity of the protein to digestion by subtilisin during refolding was investigated. The results of these studies show that the unfolded enzyme has two domains that rapidly fold to form a monomer in which the first 55 amino acids and a segment between residues 225 and 276 remain in a largely disordered form. This partially folded enzyme can form dimers and slowly undergoes a rate determining conformational change in which the unstructured segments assume their native state.

Escherichia coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase (eSHMT) ( 1The abbreviations used are: eSHMTE. coli serine hydroxymethyltransferasePLPpyridoxal 5′-phosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidapoDapolipoprotein D.) is a 94-kDa homodimer that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of serine and glycine with tetrahydrofolate serving as the one carbon carrier. Each subunit of the holoenzyme contains PLP attached to Lys229 as an aldimine. Removal of the PLP generates the apoenzyme, which remains dimeric. The 417-residue subunit contains 3 Trp residues at positions 16, 183, and 385(1.Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase pyridoxal 5′-phosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid apolipoprotein D. In a previous study we demonstrated that eSHMT could be reversibly refolded from 8 M urea after a 10-fold dilution at concentrations as high as 1 mg/ml of protein(2.Cai K. Schirch D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19294-19299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At 30°C refolding was essentially complete in 6 min. This study also provided evidence for several intermediates and a mechanism as shown in. The most important information was obtained with refolding done at 4°C, where distinct kinetic intermediates could be shown to exist for periods of several hours and complete refolding took as long as 20 h. U is the unfolded enzyme and rapidly folds in a few seconds to form a monomer M. This monomer forms dimers (labeled as D′) during 20 min at 4°C. The dimer D′ does not bind PLP but undergoes a slow rate-determining conformational change to a dimer (apoD) that can bind PLP to form native holoD. At 30°C the process of converting D′ to apoD takes a few minutes, but at 4°C it takes many hours. The purpose of this study was to obtain structural information about M, D′, and apoD. Because these intermediates exist for minutes to hours at 4°C, a variety of physical measurements can be made to aid in elucidation of their structure. Important information can be obtained on the structure of intermediates by monitoring the fluorescence properties of Trp residues. To simplify the interpretation of results with eSHMT, we made single Trp mutants by changing the remaining two Trp residues in this enzyme to Phe. We also used protease digestion to determine what regions of the protein in each intermediate had been folded into a protease-resistant form. The results provide evidence for the rapid formation of two domains with an NH2-terminal region and a central region of the amino acid sequence remaining largely in a random coil until the final rate-determining step. Ultra pure urea, all coenzymes, amino acids, and buffers were obtained from Sigma. A Transformer(™) site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from ClonTech (Palo Alto, CA). Restriction enzymes were from DuPont NEN. All mutants were made by the unique site elimination method of Deng and Nickoloff(3.Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used to generate Trp to Phe mutants and to introduce silent mutations for new restriction sites are as follows: 5′-pGCCGAACTGTTCCAGGCCATGGAG-3′ was used to change Trp186 to Phe and to introduce a NcoI site (the underlined bases are the positions of the mismatch); 5′-pCGTGGTGGACTTCGCGAAAATGCG-3′ was used to change Trp183 to Phe and to introduce a NruI site; 5′-pGCGAAAGAGCTCGCTGGCTTCATGTGTGACG-3′ was used to change Trp385 to Phe and to introduce a SacI site. Double and triple mutants were made by introducing two or three primers in one mutagenic experiment. Mutations were identified by unique restriction enzyme digestion and by sequence analysis of the structural gene. All mutant eSHMTs, as well as the wild-type enzyme, were expressed and purified from E. coli strain GS1993, which is glyA−, as described previously(4.Delle Fratte S. Iurescia S. Angelaccio S. Bossa F. Schirch V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 225: 395-401Google Scholar). The purity of each protein was >98% as judged by SDS-PAGE. Apo-eSHMT was prepared by adding L-cysteine and chromatographing on a phenyl-Sepharose column(2.Cai K. Schirch D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19294-19299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The apoenzyme was stored at 0°C for no more than 3 days before use. ε278 mn for each holoenzyme was calculated from the amino acid composition by the method of Gill and von Hippel(5.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). The original molar absorption coefficient for wild-type eSHMT was determined by weighing a dried protein sample of known absorbance. This value was in close agreement with the predicted value determined by the method calculated from the amino acid composition and the value determined from the Bio-Rad protein kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The experimentally determined molar absorption coefficient values for the mutant proteins were obtained only by the Bio-Rad method. Km and Vmax values were determined at 30°C with serine and tetrahydrofolate as substrates (1.Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrahydrofolate was used at 0.15 mM in each assay, which is six times its Km value, and L-serine was varied in concentration between 0.2 and 3.2 mM. Thermograms for the denaturation of each protein were obtained with an MC-2 scanning calorimeter from Microcal, Inc. (Amherst, MA). Protein samples were dialyzed for 24 h against several changes of either 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM EDTA or the same buffer with 20 mM potassium phosphate replacing the Tris-HCl. Protein concentrations were near 3.0 mg/ml for all samples. Data were analyzed using the software supplied with the instrument. The Tm was the average value of three individual measurements for each sample. Fluorescence spectra were taken on a Shimadzu 5000 fluorimeter with 5-nm slits for both excitation and emission. A circulation bath was used to maintain the desired temperature. Fluorescence quenching experiments were performed by adding 10-μl aliquots of an 8 M solution of acrylamide to 2 ml of the enzyme solution. Data were corrected for dilution and inner filter effects (6.Parker C.A. Photoluminescence of Solutions. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1968: 220-222Google Scholar) as well as any change in fluorescence intensity of the sample during the measurement. Constants for collisional and static quenching were calculated according to the methods of Eftink and Ghiron (7.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) using the following equation. In this equation Q is acrylamide concentration, Fo and F are the fluorescence in the absence and the presence of acrylamide, respectively, KSV is the collisional quenching constant, and V is the static quenching constant. CD spectra were taken on a Jasco J-500A spectropolarimeter as described previously(1.Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of apo-eSHMT was 0.15 mg/ml for both fluorescence and CD experiments except where otherwise indicated. 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM EDTA buffer was used throughout the unfolding-refolding experiments and will be referred to as the Tris buffer. Equilibrium unfolding was performed by adding a concentrated solution of either wild-type or mutant apo-eSHMTs to a series of urea concentrations in the Tris buffer(2.Cai K. Schirch D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19294-19299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These solutions were incubated for 2 h at 30°C or 20 h at 4°C before analysis by fluorescence spectrometry. The fluorescence equilibrium unfolding data were converted to the apparent fraction of native protein (Fapp) and plotted versus urea concentration as defined by: Yobsd is the observed value of the fluorescence signal at a particular urea concentration in the region where the protein is unfolding. The fluorescence values for YN (native apoenzyme) and YU (unfolded apoenzyme) were obtained by linear extrapolation of the base lines for native and unfolded protein into the region where the protein was unfolding(8.Cupo J.F. Pace C.N. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2654-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9.Matthews C.R. Crisanti M.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The equilibrium unfolding-refolding plots were fit to either a two-state or three-state model. In a three-state model an intermediate (I) accumulates as shown in. For a two-state model only U and N are present. The equations used to fit each model are as described by Matthews and Crisanti (9.Matthews C.R. Crisanti M.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Unfolding experiments were performed by a 20-fold dilution of concentrated apo-eSHMT solutions (30 mg/ml) into a solution of freshly prepared 8.4 M urea containing Tris buffer. A 10-fold dilution of unfolded protein into Tris buffer was used throughout the study to initiate refolding. The final protein concentration was typically 0.15 mg/ml except where otherwise indicated. Refolding was monitored by Trp fluorescence or the formation of functional active sites as described previously(2.Cai K. Schirch D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19294-19299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of subtilisin carlsberg (1 mg/ml) in 2 mM CaCl2 and 100 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride in ethanol were prepared immediately before use. Unfolded eSHMTs in 8 M urea were diluted into Tris buffer by a 10-fold dilution at 4°C. 10 μl of the subtilisin stock solution was added to 200 μl of the refolding sample at desired times from 0 s to 60 min after initiation of refolding and incubated for exactly 2 min. Each digestion was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of the phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride stock solution. A native apo-eSHMT control was made in 0.8 M urea with the same final protein concentration as the refolding samples and digested by the same procedure. All samples were concentrated 10-fold at low temperature in a speed-vac. 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, which had been adjusted to pH 3 by HCl, was added to each concentrated protein. All samples were placed in a boiling water bath for 1 min and after cooling adjusted to neutral pH by the addition of 10 μl of 2 M NaOH. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% acrylamide gel(10.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 0-8 M linear urea gradient polyacrylamide gel was made from stock solutions of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 8 M urea in the same buffer(11.Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To compensate for the change in pore size of the polyacrylamide with increasing urea a gradient of acrylamide was made from 15 to 11%. Each form of eSHMT, 75 μg, in Tris buffer, pH 8.0, was layered on top of the gel in a 6-cm slot, and electrophoresis was performed at 300 V for 2 h at room temperature. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequences of proteolytic-resistant fragments were determined as follows. Protease-treated enzyme was analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. After destaining, the protein bands were cut from the gel with a razor blade. The protein was eluted from the gel by electrophoresis. The protein was precipitated with acetone-triethylamine acetic acid (90:5:5) solution. The precipitated protein was centrifuged, washed with the acetone-triethylamine acetic acid solution, dissolved in 50 mM pH 6.0, MES, and dialyzed against this buffer. After determining the protein concentration by absorbance at 278 nm, aliquots were subjected to amino-terminal sequencing by five cycles of conventional Edman degradation on a G1000 A HP sequencer. Another aliquot of eluted protein (about 0.2 mg) was incubated with 4 μg of carboxypeptidase Y, and aliquots were removed at 10, 30, 60, 90, and 180 min. After removing protein with trichloroacetic acid and centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed for released amino acids on an amino acid analyzer. Single Trp mutant eSHMTs were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzed by DNA sequencing. The wild-type enzyme contains 3 Trp residues at positions 16, 183, and 385. We will refer to the single Trp mutants by the position of the single remaining Trp residue in each mutant, i.e. Trp186, Trp183, and Trp385 eSHMTs. In addition, a mutant protein was purified that contained no Trp residues. This is referred to as the Trp− eSHMT in Table 1. Each mutant protein was expressed and purified as described previously for wild-type eSHMT (1.Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes were analyzed for kinetic constants, thermal stability, and absorption properties at 278 nm. These results are recorded in Table 1. For each mutant protein the determined molar absorption coefficient values at 278 nm were very close to the predicted values determined from the amino acid composition(5.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). The Tm values, determined by differential scanning calorimetry in Tris buffer, showed that each single Trp mutant was slightly less stable to thermal denaturation, with the Trp385 mutant being the least stable with a Tm almost 7°C lower than the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). The values for Tm obtained in potassium phosphate buffer were within 1°C of those obtained in Tris buffer for each enzyme form. Increasing temperature irreversibly denatures eSHMT, and the thermograms do not fit a two-state curve. The thermograms can be deconvoluted into several two-state processes, suggesting that thermal denaturation is a complex process of subunit separation and unfolding of domains.Table 1 Open table in a new tab Km values for serine were essentially identical for all of the single Trp mutants and wild-type enzymes (Table 1). Each mutant enzyme exhibited considerable catalytic activity as well as the enzyme, which had all three Trp residues replaced by Phe. The single Trp mutants with the least activity were the Trp186 and Trp385 enzymes, which exhibited relative specific activity values of 0.86. The properties of the mutant eSHMTs, as recorded in Table 1, suggest that each mutant enzyme has only minor structural differences compared with the wild-type enzyme. The solvent exposure of the Trp residue in each single Trp mutant apoenzyme was estimated by analyzing its fluorescence spectra(7.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). The Trp fluorescence emission maxima at both 4 and 30°C for the Trp186, Trp183, and Trp385 mutant apoenzymes were 338 nm, 325 nm, and 334 nm, respectively (Fig. 1). Evidence that the individual Trp residues in the mutant proteins are very close to their environment in the wild-type enzyme is suggested by the combined fluorescence spectra of the mutant enzymes. If the Trp residues in the mutant apoenzymes are in the same environment as they are in the native apoenzyme, then their combined emission spectra should be the same as the emission spectrum of the wild-type apoenzyme. As shown in Fig. 1, the sum of the fluorescence spectra for the three Trp mutant apoenzymes is about 5% lower than the fluorescence spectrum of the wild-type apoenzyme. Errors in calculating protein concentrations for the mutant enzymes could easily account for the 5% difference. The sum of the three emission spectra of the mutant apoenzymes has the same 333 nm wavelength maximum observed for the native enzyme (Fig. 1). The equilibrium fraction folded ratio (Fapp) was determined in increasing urea concentrations for mutant and wild-type apo-eSHMTs by both fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. Fig. 2A compares the CD220 signals of the apoenzymes. The urea concentration resulting in 50% folding is shifted from 2.5 M urea for the wild-type enzyme to about 2.3-2.4 M urea for the three mutant enzymes. The results suggest that with respect to secondary structure there is little difference in the unfolding pattern between the mutant and wild-type apoenzymes. Although each set of data was fit to a two-state model, the data points are not of sufficient accuracy to rule out a three-state model. These CD results are in agreement with the thermal denaturation studies that the mutant enzymes are slightly less stable than the wild-type enzyme. Fig. 2B compares the fluorescence signals of Trp residues at equilibrium as a function of urea concentration. The data points were fit to either a two-state or a three-state model and are represented by the solid lines. A three-state model suggests that an intermediate (I) exists at a significant concentration between the unfolded state U and the folded state N as shown in. The wild-type apoenzyme (solid circles) is fit by a three-state model, suggesting that the fluorescence of Trp residues in the intermediate are different from either the fully folded or the unfolded state. Fig. 3 shows how the relative concentrations of N, I, and U vary with increasing urea concentration. In general, between 1 and 2 M urea the predominate species are N (solid circles) and I (triangles), and between 2 and 4 M urea the predominate species are I and U (open circles). I is the predominate protein species at 2 M urea. An estimate of the free energy changes for N to I and I to U () in the absence of urea was calculated by fitting the three-state equilibrium curve for the wild-type apoenzyme(9.Matthews C.R. Crisanti M.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These values are recorded in Table 2. Although there is considerable error in these estimations, the results suggest that the free energy of denaturation for this protein consists of two similar transitions.Table 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The equilibrium fluorescence properties of the three single Trp mutant apoenzymes are very different (Fig. 2B). Because these mutant apoproteins all have similar stabilities, the differences in Trp fluorescence with increasing urea concentration are not the result of differences in the stability of the intermediate (I) for each mutant apoenzyme but reflect the differences in the fluorescence properties of the individual Trp residue in the intermediate. Inspection of the curves suggests that most of the change in fluorescence for the Trp186 apoenzyme occurs in the N to I transformation, whereas for Trp385 apo-eSHMT virtually all of the change in fluorescence occurs in the I to U transition. This shows that in the intermediate Trp186 is nearly fully exposed and Trp385 is still fully buried. The Trp183 fluorescence change occurs in both reactions, suggesting that in the intermediate Trp183 experiences an environment that is different than in either the native state or the unfolded state. The equilibrium fluorescence curve for Trp183 eSHMT did not fit either a two-state or three-state model. It is shown in Fig. 2B as a two-state fit only for visual effect. Each refolding curve was determined over a 10-fold concentration range of enzyme. Only the Trp186 mutant apoenzyme showed any concentration dependence. A 25-fold increase in protein concentration shifted the midpoint of the urea unfolding curve from 1.1 to 1.6 M urea. This suggests that changes in the fluorescence of Trp186 apo-eSHMT may be associated with the formation of dimers in the equilibrium unfolding pathway. The multimeric state and the size of a protein as a function of urea concentration can be investigated by electrophoresis in a urea gradient gel. The photograph of a urea gradient gel with wild-type apo-eSHMT is shown in Fig. 3. The native dimer migrates only slightly faster at 0 M urea than the fully unfolded monomer at 6-8 M urea. In the region of 1-4 M urea, there is an increase in size with a sharp band that runs considerably slower than the native dimer. There is also a background smear of protein that occurs between the two bands. A possible interpretation of this pattern is given under “Discussion.” No reproducible differences could be found between wild-type and single Trp mutant apo-eSHMTs in these urea gradient gels, further supporting the conclusion that the mutations have not significantly altered the unfolding-refolding mechanism. The rate of refolding of each mutant apoenzyme was first investigated at 30°C by a 10-fold dilution of apoenzyme, which had been unfolded in 8 M urea for at least 2 h, into buffer containing excess PLP. Active holoenzyme is formed quantitatively in about 6-10 min for each mutant enzyme at essentially the same rate previously observed for wild-type enzyme (data not shown). This suggests that changing two of the Trp residues to Phe has not significantly altered the kinetics of the refolding reaction. As shown previously, the rate of refolding at 4°C is dramatically different than at 30°C. For the wild-type enzyme less than 10% of the catalytic activity returns within 100 min after initiation of refolding. Furthermore, the previous study showed that for wild-type apo-eSHMT refolded at 4°C, all of the secondary structure had returned within 2 min and that the enzyme had completely formed dimers after about 100 min(2.Cai K. Schirch D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19294-19299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This dimer could not bind PLP and is listed as structure D′ in. When the single Trp mutant enzymes were tested for refolding at 4°C, the return of activity was the same slow rate as observed for the wild-type enzyme. Although we did not check for the rate of dimer formation, the results of urea gradient PAGE suggests that the mutations have not altered the unfolding and separation of dimers. We assume that each mutant enzyme forms dimers at close to the same rate as observed previously for the wild-type enzyme(2.Cai K. Schirch D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19294-19299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the rate-controlling step in each single Trp mutant enzyme is the conversion of D′ to apoD as shown in. The rates of change in fluorescence was investigated with each of the mutant apoenzymes at 30°C after initiation of refolding. Both the Trp183 and Trp385 mutant apo-eSHMTs showed a rapid change in fluorescence spectra to native values following a 10-fold dilution into refolding buffer at 30°C (Fig. 4, A and B, solid lines). However, the Trp186 apoenzyme showed a much slower return of the fluorescence signal, taking about 500 s to reach 90% of the native enzyme value (Fig. 4C). The rate of return of native-like fluorescence for the Trp186 enzyme was concentration-dependent increasing about 3-fold from 0.004 to 0.1 mg/ml enzyme. Above this concentration there was no further increase in rate. The fluorescence emission properties for each apo-eSHMT during refolding at 4°C are shown as dashed lines in Fig. 4. For wild-type apo-eSHMT, refolding at 4°C in the presence of PLP results in almost no active enzyme being formed in the 1000-s time period recorded in this figure. For the Trp385 and Trp183 mutant apoenzymes, the fluorescence signal returned to native values by 120 s (Fig. 4, A and B, dashed lines). However, the return of native fluorescence for the Trp186 mutant eSHMT took as long as 15 h to reach final native values. As shown in Fig. 4C about 50% of the fluorescence change has returned in 20 min after refolding. As observed at 30°C, only Tp186 eSHMT showed any observable concentration dependence. The fluorescence emission properties of the wild-type eSHMT during refolding at 4°C as shown in Fig. 4D is a composite of the properties of the mutant enzymes. We had previously shown that in the refolding of wild-type apo-eSHMT the CD spectrum returned rapidly even at 4°C(2.Cai K. Schirch D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19294-19299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the CD spectrum from 200 to 240 nm after initiation of refolding for each mutant apo-eSHMT at 4°C. Within the 120 s it took to record the spectra, the CD signals were the same as for the native apoenzymes, confirming that for each mutant enzyme the secondary structure returns very rapidly (data not shown). To further characterize the environments of the three Trp residues during refolding at 4°C, the susceptibility of each mutant enzyme to acrylamide quenching was investigated (Fig. 5). The results are presented as the collisional quenching constant (KSV) and the static quenching constant (V) as recorded in Table 3. KSV is obtained from the initial slope of the quenching curve, and V is obtained by applying (7.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). The collisional quenching constant values show that each Trp is partially solvent-exposed with values ranging from 1.6 M−1 for Trp183 eSHMT to 5.8 M−1 for Trp186 eSHMT, suggesting that Trp183 is the most buried and Trp186 is the most solvent exposed of the three Trp residues. The collisional quenching constant values are in agreement with the values of the fluorescence emission maximum for each mutant enzyme as shown in Fig. 1. In general, the shorter the wavelength of maximum emission the more buried the Trp residue (Trp183, 325 nm; Trp385, 334 nm; and Trp186, 338 nm) with fully exposed Trp residues in the unfolded state having an emission wavelength of about 354 nm.Table 3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The quenching by acrylamide was used to follow each Trp residue during refolding at 4°C to determine what the status of each Trp residue was during the formation of intermediates M, D′, and apoD (). Quenching by acrylamide was followed for each single Trp mutant enzyme as a function of time after initiation of refolding and compared with the quenching properties of the native mutant enzymes as shown in Fig. 5D. For the Trp183 apoenzyme, acrylamide quenching was native-like within the 5 min it took to determine a quenching curve (Fig. 5A and Table 3). After 5 min the quenching of Trp385 apo-eSHMT was close to native values"
https://openalex.org/W2071923184,"Recently, we reported the discovery of a new type of sialidase, KDNase, which specifically hydrolyzes the ketosidic linkages of 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN), but not N-acylneuraminyl linkages. We now report that this enzyme, designated KDNase SM, is an inducible enzyme that is localized in the periplasm of Sphingobacterium multivorum. Growth of S. multivorum in the presence of KDN-containing oligosaccharide alditols, KDNα2→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→3[KDNα2→ (8KDNα2→)2→6]GalNAcol, as a sole carbon source induced KDNase SM activity 15-40-fold, compared with growth in the absence of inducer. KDN, Neu5Ac, or Neu5Ac oligomers were ineffective as inducers. The enzyme was released from the periplasm of induced cells by cold osmotic shock and purified 700-fold to homogeneity. The specific activity of the pure enzyme was 82,100 units/mg of protein. KDNase SM activity resided in a single polypeptide chain with an estimated molecular weight of approximately 47,500. Enzyme activity was maximal at near neutral pH. The availability of pure KDNase will now make it possible to study the structure and functional role of KDN-glycoconjugates and to determine the molecular mechanism whereby the enzyme can discriminate between KDN and N-acylneuraminic acid. Recently, we reported the discovery of a new type of sialidase, KDNase, which specifically hydrolyzes the ketosidic linkages of 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN), but not N-acylneuraminyl linkages. We now report that this enzyme, designated KDNase SM, is an inducible enzyme that is localized in the periplasm of Sphingobacterium multivorum. Growth of S. multivorum in the presence of KDN-containing oligosaccharide alditols, KDNα2→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→3[KDNα2→ (8KDNα2→)2→6]GalNAcol, as a sole carbon source induced KDNase SM activity 15-40-fold, compared with growth in the absence of inducer. KDN, Neu5Ac, or Neu5Ac oligomers were ineffective as inducers. The enzyme was released from the periplasm of induced cells by cold osmotic shock and purified 700-fold to homogeneity. The specific activity of the pure enzyme was 82,100 units/mg of protein. KDNase SM activity resided in a single polypeptide chain with an estimated molecular weight of approximately 47,500. Enzyme activity was maximal at near neutral pH. The availability of pure KDNase will now make it possible to study the structure and functional role of KDN-glycoconjugates and to determine the molecular mechanism whereby the enzyme can discriminate between KDN and N-acylneuraminic acid. INTRODUCTIONThe natural occurrence of 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN), ( 1The abbreviations used are: KDN3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-2-nonulosonic acidSiasialic acidKDN-glycoconjugatesKDN-containing glycoconjugatesKDNasean enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ketosidic linkages of KDNKDN-OSKDNα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-3[KDNα2-(8KDNα2-)n-6]GalNAcol with n = 54-MU-KDN4-methylumbelliferyl KDNKDNase SMKDNase isolated from Sphingobacterium multivorumBSAbovine serum albumin.) deaminated neuraminic acid, was first discovered in 1986 by Nadano et al.(1.Nadano D.

Substitution of the aminoacyl group at C-5 on Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc by a hydroxyl group blocks almost completely the action of bacterial exosialidases that are commonly used for the identification and structure-function studies of sialoglycoconjugates (1.Nadano D. Iwasaki M. Endo S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11550-11557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Song Y. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 460-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Recently, we isolated and identified a Gram-negative soil bacterium, Sphingobacterium multivorum, that produced a new sialidase that selectively catalyzed the hydrolysis of different types of KDN-ketosidic linkages(16.Kitajima K. Kuroyanagi H. Inoue S. Ye J. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21415-21429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The partial purification of this enzyme, designated KDNase SM, and its substrate specificity were also described previously(16.Kitajima K. Kuroyanagi H. Inoue S. Ye J. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21415-21429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most important feature of KDNase SM was the complete absence of sialidase activity that could release Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc residues from a variety of naturally occurring Neu5Ac- and Neu5Gc-containing glycoconjugates. This unique specificity was in distinct contrast with other eukaryotic KDN-sialidases that hydrolyzed both KDN and N-acylneuraminic acid α-ketosidic linkages (17.Angata T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Chang J. Warner T.G. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18.Li Y.-T. Yuziuk J.A. Li S.-C. Nematalla A. Hasegawa A. Kimura M. Nakagawa H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 310: 243-246Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since the first report of KDN residues in fish egg polysialoglycoproteins(1.Nadano D. Iwasaki M. Endo S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11550-11557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been presumed that KDN residues would not likely be restricted in occurrence to only lower vertebrates but rather would also be expressed on mammalian cells. With the recent findings that KDN-glycoconjugates are implicated in fertilization in fish egg polysialoglycoproteins(4.Kanamori A. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7.Kanamori A. Inoue S. Iwasaki M. Kitajima K. Kawai G. Yokoyama S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21811-21819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Song Y. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21929-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it became important to determine the extent of the natural occurrence of KDN-glycoconjugates in other eukaryotic organisms. While anti-KDN antibodies have been used to show that KDN-glycoconjugates are expressed in rat pancreas(12.Kanamori A. Inoue S. Xulei Z. Zuber C. Roth J. Kitajima K. Ye J. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. Histochemistry. 1994; 101: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), confirmation of this conclusion has awaited the availability of a KDNase specific for the hydrolysis of KDN-ketosidic linkages but not N-acylneuraminyl linkages. Indeed, we have shown recently that KDNase SM can be used in combination with the mAb•kdn8kdn-reactive antibodies as a diagnostic enzyme for the specific detection of KDN-glycotopes in a variety of different mammalian cells. ( 2M. Ziak, B. Qu, X. Zuo, C. Zuber, A. Kanamori, K. Kitajima, S. Inoue, Y. Inoue, and J. Roth, unpublished results.) The above observations raise the interesting question as to how KDNase SM can discriminate between KDN and N-acylneuraminic acid residues. Attempts to answer this question have been frustrated by the limited availability of KDNase SM. Because of the importance and interest in using KDNase in future investigations, we initiated studies to isolate and purify large quantities of KDNase SM. This report describes that KDNase SM is an inducible enzyme in S. multivorum when the cells are grown in the presence of KDN-oligosaccharide alditols (KDN-OS), KDNα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-3[KDNα2-(8KDNα2-)2-6]GalNAcol as the sole carbon source. We also show that the enzyme is localized in the periplasm. Based on these observations, we were successful in purifying the inducible enzyme 700-fold after osmotic shock, to homogeneity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacteriaIsolation and growth of a strain of Sphingobacterium multivorum that could grow on KDN-oligosaccharide alditols as the sole carbon source were carried out as described previously(16.Kitajima K. Kuroyanagi H. Inoue S. Ye J. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21415-21429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Assay for KDNase Activity4-Methylumbelliferyl KDN (4-MU-KDN) was used as a substrate to quantitate KDNase activity. 4-MU-KDN was kindly provided by Dr. T. G. Warner (Genentech, Inc.) (17.Angata T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Chang J. Warner T.G. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Enzyme assay mixtures containing 1.6 μl of 4-MU-KDN (0.71 μg; 1.6 nmol) were incubated in a total volume of 21.6 μl with 20 μl of enzyme dissolved in 100 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 100 mM NaCl at 25°C. After a 30-min incubation, 3.0 ml of 85 mM glycine carbonate buffer, pH 9.3, were added to a 20-μl aliquot of each incubation mixture. The 4-methylumbelliferone released was determined fluorimetrically (λexcitation = 365 nm and λemission = 450 nm) with a JASCO 821-FP fluorescence spectrophotometer as described by Warner and O'Brien(19.Warner T.G. O'Brien J.S. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2783-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Control incubations were carried out without enzyme. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the hydrolysis of 1 nmol of 4-MU-KDN per min at 25°C.Assay for Endoglycosidase, Exoglycosidase, and Protease ActivitiesThe purified KDNase was assayed for the presence of contaminating protease, exo- and endoglycosidase, and peptide:N-glycanase activities as described previously (16.Kitajima K. Kuroyanagi H. Inoue S. Ye J. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21415-21429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Preparation of Inducer OligosaccharidesKDN and KDN-OS, KDNα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-3[KDNα2-(8KDNα2-)n-6]GalNAcol with n = 5, were prepared as described previously(16.Kitajima K. Kuroyanagi H. Inoue S. Ye J. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21415-21429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A KDN-oligosaccharide alditol-rich fraction, designated “enriched” KDN-OS, was prepared as follows: rainbow trout ovarian fluid (12.3 liters) was concentrated and lyophilized, and 110 g of dried powder were obtained. The lyophilized powder (50 g) was extracted once with 1.0 liter of chloroform/methanol (2:1 (v/v)) and then with 1.0 liter of chloroform/methanol (1:2 (v/v)) at room temperature for 2 h(11.Yu S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Muto Y. Kasama T. Handa S. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9221-9229Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The delipidated residue was air-dried and weighed 39 g. The delipidated ovarian fluid-derived powder (10 g) was suspended in 100 ml of 1 M NaBH4, 0.1 M NaOH and incubated at 37°C with agitating. After 24 h, 50 ml of the same alkaline borohydride solution were added and incubated for another 24 h. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was desalted by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column (2.0 × 150 cm, eluted with water) after neutralization to ~pH 6 with glacial acetic acid followed by concentration to ~50 ml. The desalted fraction was enriched in KDN-oligosaccharide alditols. The amount of KDN was quantitated by the TBA method(20.Kitajima K. Inoue S. Kitazume S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Induction of KDNase SM Activity in S. multivorum40 ml of M9 mineral medium containing (in grams/liter) Na2HPO4, 6.0 g; KH2PO4, 3.0 g; NH4Cl, 1.0 g; NaCl, 0.5 g; MgSO4, 1 mmol; CaCl2, 0.1 mmol; and 1% (w/v) of casamino acids and glucose were inoculated with 4 × 108 cells of S. multivorum and incubated at 25°C. Cells in late log or early stationary phase of growth (42-46 h) were harvested and washed twice with M9 medium. Washed cells (6.1 × 1010) were inoculated into 2.0 ml of M9 medium with or without either 0.1% (w/v) enriched KDN-OS, KDN-OS, KDN, Neu5Ac, mild acid hydrolysate of colominic acid (oligoNeu5Ac)(21.Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), or Glc and incubated at 25°C for times varying between 6 and 48 h. At each time point, viable cell numbers and KDNase activity were determined. Cell numbers were determined by counting colonies that grew up from a series of diluted cell aliquots that were plated on LB agar plates(16.Kitajima K. Kuroyanagi H. Inoue S. Ye J. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21415-21429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measuring total cellular KDNase activity, the cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm (1,500 × g) for 10 min, resuspended in 0.5 ml of 100 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 100 mM NaCl, and sonically disrupted (50 watts, 1 min). KDNase activity was assayed in the supernatant fraction obtained after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm (6,000 × g) for 10 min.Release of KDNase SM by Osmotic Shock from S. multivorumWashed cells (1.2 × 1010), grown at 25°C in 160 ml of M9 medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) casamino acids and glucose, as described above, were inoculated into 500 ml of M9 medium containing 0.1% (w/v) enriched KDN-OS as the sole carbon source, and incubated at 25°C for 43 h. The induced cells were harvested, and the periplasmic fraction was prepared according to the cold osmotic shock procedure of Nossal and Heppel(22.Nossal N.G. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells (8 g, wet weight) were harvested and washed in cold 0.03 M NaCl-0.01 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.1) by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The washed cell pellet was weighed and resuspended in 10 volumes (v/w) of 0.033 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.1, followed by the addition, with rapid stirring, of 10 vol (v/w) of 40% (w/v) sucrose in the same buffer that contained 10−4 vol (v/w) of 0.1 M Na2EDTA, pH 7.1. After incubation with shaking at room temperature for 10 min, the sucrose-treated cells were collected by centrifugation (13,000 × g/10 min), and resuspended in 20 vol (v/w) of ice-cold 1 mM Mg(CH3COO)2 with gentle stirring for 10 min. After the addition of 2 vol (v/w) of ice cold 1 M NaCl, 1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.1), the suspension was centrifuged (13,000 × g/30 min). Enzymes localized in the periplasm were recovered in the supernatant(22.Nossal N.G. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Purification of KDNase SM from the Periplasm of S. multivorumKDNase SM was precipitated from the periplasmic fraction by the gradual addition of solid ammonium sulfate, with gentle stirring, to 90% saturation. After sitting overnight at 4°C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min, dissolved in 10 ml of 0.1 M NaCl-100 mM Tris acetate, pH 6.0, and dialyzed against 0.1 M NaCl, 0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris acetate, pH 6.0. The dialyzed solution was applied to a CM-Toyopearl 650 M column (2.2 × 11 cm, 42 ml; equilibrated with the same dialysis buffer) and eluted first with 60 ml of the same buffer, followed by elution with 400 ml of a linear NaCl gradient (0.1-0.6 M) in 0.25 M sucrose-20 mM Tris acetate, pH 6.0. The flow-through fractions were combined, concentrated to 15 ml by limited filtration (Amicon, YM10), and applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M column (2.2 × 11 cm, 42 ml), which had been equilibrated with 0.1 M NaCl, 0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The column was eluted initially with 60 ml of the same buffer as used for the equilibration, and subsequently with 60 ml of 0.5 M NaCl, 0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The unbound fractions were pooled, concentrated to 13 ml by limited filtration, and chromatographed on a CM-Toyopearl 650 M column, as described above. Six ml-fractions were collected and assayed for KDNase activity and protein, the latter by measuring absorbance at 280 nm.Chemical AnalysisProtein was quantitated by the modified Lowry method (BCA, Pierce Chemical Co.) using bovine serum albumin as the standard.Properties of KDNase SMThe apparent molecular weight of KDNase SM was estimated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described previously (16.Kitajima K. Kuroyanagi H. Inoue S. Ye J. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21415-21429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The effect of pH on the KDNase SM-catalyzed hydrolysis of 4-MU-KDN was studied by incubating the enzyme (2 μl; 7.0 milliunits) with 4-MU-KDN (1.6 μl; 1.6 nmol) in 20 μl of 0.1 M NaCl-containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA and 0.1 M Tris acetate buffer that was adjusted to pH 4.5-8.0. The effects of sodium cholate and Triton X-100 on the activity were examined at concentrations up to 0.5% (w/v).The effect of temperature on KDNase activity was tested by incubating the enzyme at 4, 15, 25, and 37°C. Thermal stability of the enzyme was also estimated by measuring the activity after preincubation of the reaction mixture at 4, 25, and 37°C for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min.RESULTSGrowth Properties of Sphingobacterium multivorum and Induction of KDNase SMThe doubling time of S. multivorum in LB medium at 25°C was approximately 50 min. A decrease in KDNase activity in both the periplasmic fraction and the sonically disrupted cell homogenate was observed when cells grown initially in the presence of KDN-oligosaccharide alditols were grown without inducer. For example, after five transfers of an induced culture in the absence of inducer, the KDNase activity decreased by 90% of that of the original level and then remained constant at about 1.2 unit/g wet cell weight. During this attenuation in KDNase activity, the doubling time and cell volumes appeared unchanged. However, when these cells were incubated with 0.1% KDN-OS as inducer in M9 minimal medium, KDNase activity was restored. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, KDNase activity per cell was 15-40-fold higher, compared with growth in the absence of inducer. On the basis of these results, we conclude that KDNase is an inducible enzyme in S. multivorum and that KDN-oligosaccharides appear to be required for induction. To confirm this finding, cells were grown for 24 h in M9 minimal medium containing the various mono- and oligosaccharides shown in Table 1, as sole carbon sources. KDN-OS and enriched KDN-OS were shown to be the only inducers of KDNase SM activity (Table 1). Free KDN had little effect on induction of KDNase SM, indicating that the ketosidic linkage of bound KDN residues was a structural requirement for induction. It is also noted in Table 1 that the cell number remained essentially unchanged during the 24 h period when 0.1% KDN, Neu5Ac, or oligoNeu5Ac were the sole carbon sources. In contrast, KDN-OS, enriched KDN-OS, and glucose were effective carbon sources, although glucose was not an inducer.Table 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab KDNase SM Is a Periplasmic Enzyme in S. multivorumBecause a number of bacterial hydrolytic enzymes including acid and alkaline phosphatases, carboxypeptidases, polyphosphatases, sugar phosphate phosphohydrolyases, 5′-nucleotidase, and sugar hydrolylases are localized in the periplasmic space(23.Anraku Y. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2561-2569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to determine if KDNase SM was a periplasmic enzyme. Cold osmotic shock is a method commonly used to release periplasmic proteins(22.Nossal N.G. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table 2, nearly all (99%) of the KDNase activity in the cell homogenate of induced cells of S. multivorum was released by osmotic shock. Importantly, the specific activity of the enzyme in the periplasm was 4.4-fold higher than in the cell homogenate (120 versus 27 units/mg of protein). As described below, we were able to exploit this finding and purify the enzyme after osmotic shock 700-fold to homogeneity.Table 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Purification of KDNase SM from S. multivorumKDNase SM was released by osmotic shock from the periplasm of induced cells of S. multivorum grown for 43 h in M9 medium containing 0.1% enriched KDN-OS and purified to homogeneity. The enzyme was first precipitated by 90% ammonium sulfate before being applied to a cation-exchange CM-Toyopearl 650 M column. The KDNase activity obtained in the flow-through fractions (1st CM-Toyopearl fraction) was applied to an anion-exchange DEAE-Toyopearl 650M column. The KDNase active fractions were not retained by this column, and the flow-through fractions (DEAE-Toyopearl fraction) were subjected to a second CM-Toyopearl 650M chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2, the KDNase activity now eluted at an NaCl concentration of 0.2-0.22 M (2nd CM-Toyopearl fraction). The KDNase activity was not adsorbed to the first CM-Toyopearl column, because the enzyme appears to have formed a complex with highly negatively charged molecules, possibly DNA or RNA, that were removed by the DEAE-Toyopearl column. The KDNase fractions at each purification step were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3), and the 2nd CM-Toyopearl fraction was shown to be pure, based on the fact that only a single band was observed when the gel was stained by the silver staining method (Fig. 3, lane 4). As summarized in Table 3, KDNase was purified 700-fold in 43% yield from the periplasmic fraction. The specific activity of the pure enzyme was 82100 unit/mg of protein. The KDNase SM thus obtained was highly specific for KDN ketosidic linkages of natural and synthetic substrates and, as reported for the partially purified enzyme, did not hydrolyze 4-MU-Neu5Ac, or other N-acylneuraminyl glycan chains(16.Kitajima K. Kuroyanagi H. Inoue S. Ye J. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21415-21429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No protease, other glycosidases, or peptide:N-glycanase activities were detected. The purified enzyme was also free of the low levels of α-fucosidase and α- and β-hexosaminidase activities that were detected previously in the affinity-purified KDNase SM(16.Kitajima K. Kuroyanagi H. Inoue S. Ye J. Troy II, F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21415-21429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2:Purification of KDNase SM from S. multivorum by CM-Toyopearl 650M chromatography. The flow-through fractions from the DEAE-Toyopearl chromatography step were applied to a column of CM-Toyopearl 650 M and eluted first with 0.25 M sucrose-20 mM Tris-acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1 M NaCl, followed by elution with a linear NaCl gradient (0.1-0.6 M) in the same buffer. 6-ml fractions were collected and assayed for KDNase activity. The protein concentration in the KDNase active fractions is not shown because it was too low to be determined without significant concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of fractions obtained at each purification step.

The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme was also estimated to be 47,500 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3, lane 4), both in the presence and absence of 2.5% mercaptoethanol. This finding indicated that KDNase SM consisted of a single polypeptide chain with an apparent Mr of approximately 47,500.InstabilityThe purified KDNase SM was extremely unstable in the absence of added protein, and lost a considerable amount of activity. Hence, the enzyme was protected from denaturation by the addition of bovine serum albumin at 0.1-1.0 mg/ml to the incubation mixtures. KDNase activity remained unchanged on storage at 4°C in the presence of 0.1% BSA for at least 6 months. As shown in Fig. 4, KDNase activity decreased by 90% after incubation at 37°C for 15 min even in the presence of 0.1% BSA. The effect of detergents often used to increase the susceptibility of glycolipid substrates to glycosidases had variable effects on KDNase activity. Triton X-100 at concentrations of 0.1-0.5% (w/v) stimulated the activity by 10-20%. In contrast, 82% of the enzyme activity was inhibited by 0.5% (w/v) sodium cholate, while 90% of the activity was retained at 0.1%.Figure 4:Thermal stability of KDNase SM. KDNase activity was determined after incubation at 4°C (○), 25°C (•), 37°C (▴) for 15, 30, and 60 min in the presence of 0.1% BSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of pH, Temperature, and Salt on KDNase SM ActivityThe pH activity profile of KDNase SM was examined in the presence of 0.1% BSA. Activity was maximal in the pH range between 6.0 and 7.0, and at 25°C. Activity decreased at 37°C, because of the instability of the enzyme at this temperature (Fig. 4). No requirement for divalent cations could be demonstrated. Exposure of the enzyme to low concentrations of NaCl (less than 0.1 M) for 30 min reversibly inactivated the enzyme. Exposure for more than 30 min irreversibly inactivated the enzyme.DISCUSSIONOur new findings show that KDNase SM in S. multivorum is an inducible enzyme that is localized in the periplasm. The specific activity in the periplasm was 9- and 4-fold higher than that in the sonic cell homogenate of the uninduced and induced cells, respectively: 6.4 versus 0.737 units/mg of protein for uninduced cells, 120 versus 27 units/mg protein for induced cells. After induction with KDN-OS or enriched KDN-OS, KDNase activity was increased 15-40-fold, and the specific activity in the periplasm was 117 units/mg of protein, which is 20-fold higher than before induction. These facts allowed us to release the enzyme from induced cells by osmotic shock, and to purify it 700-fold to homogeneity. A ketosidic linkage of KDN was necessary for induction, because neither free KDN, Neu5Ac, or oligoNeu5Ac was an inducer. Thus, a regulatory protein responsible for KDNase induction would presumably require a KDN ketosidic linkage, although the molecular mechanism for induction is not known.KDNase SM consists of a single polyp"

The uvrB gene, which plays an essential role in the prokaryotic excision repair, was cloned from an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus HB8. Its nucleotide sequence was determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence showed it possessed a helicase motif, including a nucleotide-binding consensus sequence (Walker's A-type motif), which was also conserved in other UvrB proteins. The prokaryotic UvrB proteins and eukaryotic DNA repair helicases (Rad3 and XP-D) were classified into different groups by molecular phylogenetic analysis. The T. thermophilus uvrB gene product was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified T. thermophilus UvrB protein was stable up to 80°C at neutral pH. T. thermophilus UvrB protein showed ATPase activity at its physiological temperature, whereas the E. coli UvrB protein alone has not been shown to exhibit detectable ATPase activity. The values of Km and kcat for the ATPase activity were 4.2 mM and 0.32 s−1 without DNA, and 4.0 mM and 0.46 s−1 with single-stranded DNA, respectively.

INTRODUCTIONAll living organisms have DNA repair systems to counteract the many forms of DNA damage due to sunlight, chemical agents, or ionizing radiation(1.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). If such damage is not repaired, mutagenesis or even cell death may occur. The DNA repair systems involve in situ repair (photoreactivation), base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and recombinational repair(1.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Of these, the nucleotide excision repair system can deal with a wide range of DNA lesions. In Escherichia coli of typical prokaryote, ABC excinuclease, which is encoded by the uvrA, B, and C genes, plays a major role in this system(2.Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1954-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 3.Sancar A. Rupp W.D. Cell. 1983; 33: 249-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 4.Van Houten B. Gamper H. Hearst J. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16553-16560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of the nucleotide excision repair system, studied mainly in E. coli, is as follows. First, UvrA, a damage recognition protein, makes an UvrA2B complex with UvrB (6.Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and then this complex binds to the site of the DNA lesion, forming a UvrA2B-DNA complex(6.Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 7.Orren D.K. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which, the DNA is unwound, creating a so-called “open complex.” Next, UvrA dissociates from the complex and only UvrB is bound to the DNA. Then, UvrC becomes associated with the complex, forming an UvrBC-DNA complex(6.Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). At this point, UvrB incises the 3′ side of the DNA lesion and UvrC incises the 5′ side(8.Lin J.J. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17688-17700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, DNA helicase II, DNA polymerase I, and DNA ligase complete the repair(5.Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the above model, UvrA recognizes the damaged site in the DNA and guides UvrB to it. However, Hsu et al.(9.Hsu D.S. Kim S.-T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) showed that UvrB can bind to DNA in the absence of UvrA. Although this finding indicates that UvrB plays a central role in ABC excinuclease activity, the details of the reaction mechanism are not clear. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of this enzyme's action in detail, enzymatic studies and physicochemical approaches, including x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance, are required.Thermus thermophilus HB8 is an aerobic, rod-shaped, nonsporulating, Gram-negative eubacterium, which can grow at temperatures over 75°C(10.Oshima T. Imahori K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1974; 24: 102-112Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 11.Stetter K.O. Fiala G. Huber G. Huber R. Segerer A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 75: 117-124Crossref Google Scholar). Although hyper-thermophilic bacteria can grow at temperatures over 100°C (such as Pyrococcus fuliosus, 11), T. thermophilus is the most thermophilic bacterium whose gene manipulating system has been established among thermophilic bacteria. Its proteins are heatstable and easily crystallized(12.Stallings W.C. Pattridge K.A. Strong R.K. Ludwig M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16424-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Imada K. Sato M. Tanaka N. Katsube Y. Matsuura Y. Oshima T. J. Mol.

Biol. 1993; 234: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), so they are suitable for detailed physicochemical research.In this study, we cloned and sequenced the uvrB gene from T. thermophilus. The gene was overexpressed in E. coli, and its product was purified to homogeneity. ATPase activity in the absence and presence of DNA and stability of T. thermophilus UvrB protein were also reported. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of ATPase activity of this UvrB protein itself, whereas its E. coli counterpart has not been shown to exhibit detectable ATPase activity. We also found that the UvrB protein could interact with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosidePCRpolymerase chain reactionCBBCoomassie Brilliant BlueCDcircular dichroism. in the absence of UvrA.MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzymes and ChemicalsThe enzymes and reagents were purchased as follows: DNA modification enzymes, including restriction endonucleases, from Takara Shuzo, Nippon Gene, Toyobo, and New England Biolabs; Taq DNA polymerase from Perkin Elmer; isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) from Wako Pure Chemical; DEAE-cellulose DE52 from Whatman Biochemicals; Phenyl-Toyopearl 650 M from Tosoh; hydroxylapatite from Nacalai Tesque; [α-32P]ATP from ICN; plastic-backed polyethyleneimine cellulose sheets (MN-Polygram CEL200PEI/UV) from Machery and Nagel; poly(dC) from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The concentration of poly(dC) was determined using its molar absorption coefficient ∋268 = 7,400 M−1•cm−1(15.Ts'o P.O.P. Rapaport S.A. Bollum F.J. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 4153-4170Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar).

They were grown in Terrific broth or LB medium at 37°C(18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The T. thermophilus HB8 strain was grown at 70°C under the conditions described previously(16.Kato R. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The plasmids used were pUC118, pUC119, and pET3a(17.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar, 18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Cloning and Sequencing of the T. thermophilus uvrB GeneThe amino acid sequences of UvrB proteins from E. coli(19.Arikan E. Kulkarni M.S. Thomas D.C. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2637-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and Micrococcus luteus(20.Shiota S. Nakayama H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 213: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were aligned, and two highly conserved regions were chosen as the bases for synthesizing oligonucleotide primers for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)(21.Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Hullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13396) Google Scholar). The left and right mixed primers were 5′-TACTACGACTACTA(C/T)CA(G/A)CC-3′ (20 mer) and 5′-ATCTG(G/C)GGGAT(G/C)GT(G/C)AC(G/A)TG-3′ (20 mer), respectively. T. thermophilus genomic DNA (0.2 μg) was added to the PCR mixture and then denatured at 98°C for 10 min without DNA polymerase. Following the addition of Taq DNA polymerase, the PCR was carried out for 30 cycles of 1 min at 98°C, 1 min at 50°C, and 2 min at 72°C with a 3-min ramp time. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified DNA fragment, which was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, was determined to confirm that the translated amino acid sequence was similar to that of the UvrB protein. The amplified DNA fragment (Fig. 1, b-1) was cloned into pUC118 for use as a probe. T. thermophilus genomic DNA was digested with several restriction endonucleases and then subjected to Southern hybridization. The DNA fragments that hybridized with the probe were purified and ligated with pUC119 to construct a mini-gene bank. The E. coli cells transformed with the plasmids were screened by colony hybridization and a 6.5-kilobase pair positive DNA fragment (Fig. 1, pNB1) was obtained. Further screening was carried out using a BglII-BamHI fragment of pNB1 as a probe (Fig. 1, b-2) to clone the C-terminal region of the gene and a DNA fragment, pNB2 (Fig. 1), was obtained. A DNA fragment containing the entire T. thermophilus uvrB gene was then constructed by ligation of parts of pNB1 and pNB2 (Fig. 1, pNB3). The nucleotide sequence of pNB3 was determined on both strands by the dideoxy method (Applied Biosystems, Taq cycle sequencing system) using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 373A). To prevent the pausing of sequencing reaction, secondary structure of T. thermophilus DNA, which has a high G+C content, was destroyed by heat denaturation (98°C, 10 min) prior to the sequencing reaction.Phylogenetic CalculationMolecular evolutionary calculations for construction of a phylogenetic tree were performed with the aid of the ODEN program package written by Y. Ina of the National Institute of Genetics (Mishima, Japan).Overexpression of the T. thermophilus uvrB Gene in E. coliA pair of DNA primers, 5′-CCCTATACTGGGTGCATATGACCTTCCGCTAC-3′ and 5′-GGGCGAGGACCAAAGCGGGCCTTC-3′ were synthesized to create a NdeI restriction endonuclease site for the first ATG codon of the T. thermophilus uvrB gene. The underlining of the former primer indicates the NdeI site and the latter contained a unique restriction endonuclease site, NcoI, 200 base pairs downstream from the first ATG. A DNA fragment of about 200 base pairs was amplified by PCR using pNB3 as a template, under the conditions described above. The amplified fragment was sequenced to confirm that no mutation other than at the NdeI site was present. Then, the DNA fragments of NdeI-NcoI of the PCR product, NcoI-blunt ended BlnI of pNB3 and NdeI-blunt ended BamHI of pFT3a were ligated. The resulting plasmid was named pYB1 and used to study expression in E. coli cells. The T. thermophilus uvrB gene was not overexpressed in E. coli when it was inserted under control of the T7 promoter (data not shown). The co-existence of the pLysE plasmid, which represses the basal expression of the gene, was required for overproduction of the protein. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysE harboring plasmid pYB1 was cultivated at 37°C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. When the cells had grown to 4 × 108 cells/ml, IPTG was added to produce a concentration of 50 μg/ml. After an additional 3 h of incubation, the cells were harvested and stored at −80°C.Purification of T. thermophilus UvrB ProteinFrozen cells (20 g) were thawed and suspended in buffer I (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, 8 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 25% (w/v) sucrose). They were sonicated on ice for 4 min with an ultrasonic disrupter (Tomy, UD201) at maximum output with a standard tip. Then Brij-58 was added to a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v) and held on ice for 30 min. The cell extract was incubated at 70°C for 20 min and then centrifuged (48,000 × g) for 20 min at 4°C. At this step, most of the E. coli proteins could be excluded. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer II (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 100 mM KCl and then loaded onto a column of DEAE-cellulose (bed volume 200 ml) equilibrated with this buffer. The column was washed with 250 ml buffer II containing 150 mM KCl and then eluted with a 1,000 ml gradient of 150-500 mM KCl in buffer II. The eluate was monitored by absorption at 280 nm with a spectrophotometer (Hitachi, model 323), and the fractions around the peaks were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The fractions containing UvrB protein, which was eluted at 300 mM KCl, were pooled and dialyzed against buffer II containing 10% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The sample was loaded onto a column of Phenyl-Toyopearl 650 M (bed volume 80 ml) equilibrated with this buffer; the column was eluted with a 500-ml gradient of 10-0% (w/v) ammonium sulfate in buffer II, and then washed with an additional 100 ml of buffer II. The fractions were analyzed as described above, and UvrB protein was eluted at 0% ammonium sulfate. The fractions containing the protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer III (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), and then loaded onto a column of hydroxylapatite (bed volume 80 ml) equilibrated with this buffer. The column was eluted with a 400 ml gradient of 10-200 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) in buffer III. The fractions were analyzed as described above, and UvrB protein was eluted at 120 mM potassium phosphate. These fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer II containing 100 mM KCl, and then stored at 4°C. The amount of purified UvrB protein obtained was 40 mg, and the yield was 2 mg of protein/1 g of E. coli cells (wet weight).The purity of the final fraction of T. thermophilus UvrB protein was over 99%, based on the densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) (Fig. 4B, lane 5) or silver-staining, N-terminal amino acid sequencing analysis and the size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 8). The final T. thermophilus UvrB fraction was extremely pure, as shown by the observation of no contamination bands on the gel by silver-staining, which is 100 times more sensitive than ordinary CBB staining(22.Hames B.D.

The band of the protein visualized using CBB was cut out and analyzed by a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 473A).

The residue molar ellipticity, [θ], was defined as 100•θobs•(lc)−1, where θobs is the observed molar ellipticity, l is the length of the light path in cm, and c is the residue molar concentration of T. thermophilus UvrB protein. CD measurements were performed using a Jasco spectropolarimeter, model J-500A, equipped with an interface and a computer.ATPase AssayHydrolysis of ATP by T. thermophilus UvrB protein was measured at 65°C by thin-layer chromatography(25.Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8856-8858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture (total volume 10 μl) comprised 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 μMT. thermophilus UvrB protein, 200 μM poly(dC), which was used as ssDNA, and [α-32P]ATP (concentration as specified, 5.55 MBq/ml) as indicated concentration. One drop of mineral oil was floated on the top of the reaction mixture to prevent evaporation. Following a 5-min incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS. After dissolving the oil with chloroform, 0.3-μl aliquots were spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose sheets and eluted with 0.75 M potassium phosphate (pH 3.4). The sheets were placed in contact with imaging plates for 20 min, and then the radioactive counts due to ATP and ADP were determined using a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji photo film).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCloning, Sequencing, and Primary Structure of the T. thermophilus uvrB GeneThe amino acid sequences of previously determined UvrB proteins were aligned, and highly conserved regions of the proteins were chosen as bases for primer design. Using the synthesized primers, part of the T. thermophilus uvrB gene was amplified by the PCR. Using this DNA fragment (Fig. 1, b-1) as a probe, five positive colonies were screened from approximately 1,000 colonies of the mini-gene bank as described under “Materials and Methods.” Plasmid DNA was prepared from each positive colony, all of which contained the same part of the uvrB gene (Fig. 1, pNB1). To clone the 3′ region of the gene, we screened the other mini-gene bank using probe b-2 as described above, and obtained the DNA fragment pNB2 (Fig. 1). A plasmid, pNB3, which covered the entire T. thermophilus uvrB gene, was constructed from pNB1 and pNB2 (Fig. 1).The nucleotide sequence of the T. thermophilus uvrB gene was determined, as described under “Materials and Methods,” and its G+C content was 68%, which agrees well with that of T. thermophilus HB8 genomic DNA (69%)(10.Oshima T. Imahori K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1974; 24: 102-112Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar). An open reading frame consisting of 1,995 nucleotides, which encoded a 665-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of about 76.2 kDa was found. As shown in Fig. 2, the amino acid sequence of T. thermophilus UvrB protein is similar to that of other UvrB proteins. Comparison of the T. thermophilus UvrB protein with those of E. coli(19.Arikan E. Kulkarni M.S. Thomas D.C. Sancar A.

The finding of the uvrB gene in T. thermophilus suggests that a UvrABC-like nucleotide excision repair system is present in this extremely thermophilic bacterium. The cloning of a UvrA homologue from T. thermophilus 2N. Yamamoto, R. Kato, and S.

DNA helicase activity has been detected by a E. coli UvrA-UvrB complex(30.Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3638-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31.Oh E.Y. Grossman L. J. Biol.

Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA helicase activity may be a general requirement for DNA excision repair, because some proteins that are components of DNA repair complexes possess such activity.The amino acid sequences of UvrB proteins and other DNA helicases were aligned and compared. Using the evolutionary distance values calculated by the method of Zuckerkandl and Pauling(33.Zuckerkandl E. Pauling L. Bryson V. Vogel H.J. Evolving Genes and Proteins. Academic Press, New York1965: 97-166Crossref Google Scholar), a phylogenetic tree for the proteins was constructed by the neighbor-joining method of Saitou and Nei(34.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 3. The tree suggests that these proteins can be classified into three groups. The first group comprises the UvrB proteins from different prokaryotic species. The second group consists of yeast Rad3 (35.Reynolds P. Higgins D.R. Prakash L. Prakash S.

UvrB, Rad3, and XP-D proteins are all components of DNA repair complexes, which are, however, located on different branches of the pedigree. The repair DNA helicases may have separated at an early evolutionary stage and then developed individually into the prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA helicases in each repair complex.Figure 3:Phylogenetic tree of the UvrB proteins and DNA/RNA helicases.

Cell transfection and molecular studies have demonstrated that the C-terminal domains for plectin and DPI specifically interact with several IF types(21.Stappenbeck T.S. Green K.J. J.

The central regions of all three proteins, which lack homology to one another, nonetheless contain highly significant heptad repeats characteristic of α-helical coiled-coil rods, similar to the rod domain of myosin or to the core of IF heterodimers(20.Green K.J. Virata M.L.A. Elgart G.W. Stanley J.R. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1992; 14: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24.Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Purified DPI dimerizes and has an extended dumbbell-like shape in which terminal globular regions are separated by a central rod(25.O'Keefe E.J. Erickson H.P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8310-8318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plectin and BPAG1 appear to take similar but less well-characterized conformations(26.Foisner R. Leichtfried F.E. Hermann H. Small J.V. Lawson D. Wiche G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27.Klatte D.H. Jones J.C.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The actual size of the N-terminal globular domains in BPAG1, DPI, or plectin have not been measured directly. In the case of BPAG1, this is of particular interest since the presence of heptad repeats in its N-terminal homology domain has suggested that coiled-coil rod formation may extend as far as 450 amino acids into this domain from the central, nonhomologous rod region(16.Tanaka T.

Macromol. 1992; 14: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In plectin and DPI, the N-terminal homology region lacks certain characteristics generally associated with coiled-coil structures, such as a high (>1.0) ratio of charged/apolar amino acids, and, thus, rod formation in these domains is considered unlikely(19.Virata M.L.A. Wagner R.M. Parry D.A.D. Green K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20.Green K.J. Virata M.L.A. Elgart G.W. Stanley J.R. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1992; 14: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In N-terminal conserved regions of BPAG1, however, the presence of heptad repeats along with a high level of predicted interchain charge interactions has led to predictions that α-helical coiled-coil formation initiates at residue 708 or 875 (16.Tanaka T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17784-17790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rather than near the boundary of the N-terminal homology domain (residue 1145) as is the case with plectin and DPI(20.Green K.J. Virata M.L.A. Elgart G.W. Stanley J.R. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1992; 14: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In order to directly establish the boundary of the N-terminal globular and central rod domains in BPAG1, two BPAG1-derived polypeptides containing the predicted N-terminal rod domain transitions were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The renatured polypeptides dimerize and, by rotary shadowing, are shown to have highly asymmetric structures in which a globular N-terminal conincides with the N-terminal homology region defined by comparison with plectin and DPI. cDNA clones II-1 and III-1, representing a portion of the BPAG1 sequence, were obtained from J. R. Stanley (NIH) and are described in Fig. 1 of Tanaka et al.(16.Tanaka T. Parry D.A.D. Klaus-Kovtun V. Steinert P.M. Stanley J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12555-12559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pET series of protein expression vectors (28.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5966) Google Scholar) were supplied by Novagen (Madison, WI). Purified human fibrinogen was a kind gift of S. I. Chung (NIH), while rabbit tropomyosin was donated by F. Whitby and G. N. Phillips (Rice University). Zwittergent 3-16 (n-hexadecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate) was purchased from Calbiochem. Plasmids were carried in JM101 (Stratagene) except where indicated. BP-1 was assembled as follows. Clone III-1 was cut at SalI (from the plasmid multiple cloning site) and AsnI (which is in the region of overlap with clone II-1). Similarly, clone II-1 was excised at the AsnI site overlapping clone III-1 and at PstI in the polylinker region of the vector. The fragments from clone II-1 and III-1 were ligated simultaneously into pEX-2 (29.Stanley K.K. Luzio J.P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1429-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) to create pEX-BP-1, a β-galactosidase fusion protein. The 3′ and 5′ ends of BP-1 were verified as correct by dideoxy sequencing using specific primers for pEX-2, but protein could not be expressed in significant quantities. The entire BP-1 coding sequence, contained as an EcoRI fragment in pEX-BP1, was ligated into pET-5c(28.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5966) Google Scholar), which contains an upstream promoter for bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. Protein was expressed in the bacterial strain BL21(DE3) following isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-induced synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase(28.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5966) Google Scholar). BP-1 spans amino acids 663-1581 of the predicted BPAG1 amino acid sequence (18.Sawamura D. Li K. Chu M.-L. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17784-17790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and includes N- and C-terminal peptides derived from the cloning vector itself (see Table 1). BP-1A was created by insertion of the 2.2-kilobase HincII/EcoRI fragment of BP-1 into pET-5c, such that the 186 N-terminal amino acids derived from BPAG1 were deleted. pET-5c was first linearized at BamHI, then blunt-ended by the Klenow enzyme, and finally cut with EcoRI prior to ligation to the HincII/EcoRI fragment of BP-1. The exogenous sequences present at the C-terminal of BP-1A are identical with those in BP-1, so that the proteins differ only at their N termini. BL21(DE3) transformed with pET vectors was selected in 50 μg/ml ampicillin in LB medium on agar at 37°C, and transformants best expressing protein were stored at −70°C in 50% glycerol as stock. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 with 500 ml of fresh LB containing ampicillin and cultured at 37°C. At an A600 of 0.6-0.8, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (0.4 mM) was added, and cells were harvested 2-4 h later. Cell pellets were resuspended in a small volume of 5% sucrose, 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA and lysed in a French press (16,000 p.s.i.) (SLM Instruments, Inc., Urbana). For extraction of BP-1, 0.2 M NaCl, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mM EDTA (30.Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) was added to the lysate which was then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1 mM EDTA and washed again. This pellet is thought to contain primarily bacterial inclusion bodies (30.Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and was dissolved in 8 M urea, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 1 mM DTT and clarified by centrifugation. BP-1A was present in soluble form in a French Press lysate, prepared as above following centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The BP-1 extract was run on DEAE-cellulose in the presence of 8 M urea, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 1 mM DTT, and eluted at ~50 mM NaCl in a 0-0.5 M NaCl gradient in the same buffer. The partially purified protein was renatured by dialysis into 20 mM Hepes-Na, pH 7.0, and 1 mM DTT in a microdialyzer (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1-2 h at room temperature and shifted to 4°C overnight. Dialyzed protein was centrifuged for 30 min at 200,000 × g in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge to remove aggregated material. The crude (200,000 × g) BP-1A supernatant was dialyzed overnight in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM EDTA, and was loaded on a DEAE-cellulose column (3 × 22 cm). The column was washed with 10-15 column volumes of low salt buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM EDTA), and BP-1A was eluted by 0.12 M NaCl in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM EDTA. The fractions that contained BP-1A were pooled and concentrated by stirring ultrafiltration (Amicon, Beverly, MA) to about 15-20 mg of total protein/ml. The protein was further purified on a 375-ml Sephacryl HR 500 gel filtration column (2.5 × 70 cm) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 0.1 M NaCl at a flow rate of about 6 ml/h. The resolution of BP-1A from contaminants was greatly improved by slowing the rate of elution, as would be expected for a highly asymmetric protein. The purest material was obtained by pooling the earliest fractions of the BP-1A peak. In some cases, the peak fractions from S-500 were loaded on a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with the starting buffer 0.1 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM EDTA. After washing, BP-1A was eluted with a 0.1-0.4 M phosphate gradient in 0.5 mM DTT and 0.2 mM EDTA. BP-1A was further concentrated by stirring ultrafiltration (Amicon) if necessary for circular dichroism measurements. Sucrose gradient centrifugation was performed according to Martin and Ames (31.Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 5-20% sucrose gradient buffered in 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT for 14-18 h at 48,000 rpm. Marker proteins were procine heart fumarase (s20,w0 = 9.1), bovine heart lactate dehydrogenase (s20,w0 = 7.3), human transferrin (s20,w0 = 4.9), bovine serum albumin (s20,w0 = 4.3), human hemoglobin (s20,w0 = 4.1), and carbonic anhydrase (s20,w0 = 2.9)(32.Thacher S.M. Rice R.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 685-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration chromatography of BP-1 and BP-1A was performed on a 1.0 × 30 cm Superose 6 column (Pharmacia FPLC) in 20 mM Hepes-Na, pH 7.0, 0.1 M NaCl, and 1 mM DTT buffer at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, and the column was cooled and equilibrated in an ice bath. The marker proteins (and Stokes radii, RS) used in the gel filtration study include catalase (52 Å), β-galactosidase (69 Å), thyroglobulin (86 Å)(33.Aiyer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14992-14999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fibrinogen (107 Å)(34.van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1985Google Scholar), and erythrocyte spectrin dimer (123 Å)(35.Davis J. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7757-7766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectrin dimer was obtained from human red blood cell ghost spectrin tetramer as described(36.Shotton D.M. Burke B.E. Branton D. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 303-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) : red blood cell ghosts were dialyzed overnight at 4°C in 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.01 mM DTT at a pH of 8-9.5 adjusted with diluted NH4OH. After dialysis, the ghosts were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was incubated at 37°C for 15 min, spun again on an Eppendorf centrifuge at top speed, and stored at −20°C prior to gel filtration. The elution positions for the marker proteins were determined on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels according to distinctive subunit molecular masses: thyroglobulin (670 kDa), which gives rise to a family of 10- to 330-kDa polypeptides upon reduction for SDS-PAGE, fibrinogen (340 kDa) with 68 kDa, 55-kDa and 46-kDa subunit polypeptides, and spectrin dimer, comprised of a 220- and a 240-kDa polypeptide. BP-1 and BP-1A were identified by a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to BP-1 in this laboratory. The Stokes radii of the standards were plotted against erf−1(1 - Kd), which gives a linear plot with standard proteins(37.Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3237-3238Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 38.Siegel L.M. Monty K.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). erf−1 is the inverse error function, and Kd is a partition coefficient or measure of relative elution volume. 1 - Kd is defined as: (Vd Estimated protein molecular weights were calculated as: Mr=6πηNRss200,w/(1-vp)(Eq. 1) where all values are under standard conditions (20°C in water): η (viscosity) = 1.004; N = Avogadro's number; υ = protein partial specific volume (estimated 0.725 cm3/g); ρ = density of water (0.998 g/cm3). The ratio of actual frictional coefficient (f) to the coefficient for a spherical protein of the same molecular weight (f0) can be estimated as follows(34.van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1985Google Scholar): f/f0=RS(4πN/3Mrv)1/3(Eq. 2) Partially purified BP-1 or BP-1A, about 20-30 μg/ml, was dialyzed at 4°C against 0.155 M ammonium acetate, pH 7.5 overnight, as described(36.Shotton D.M. Burke B.E. Branton D. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 303-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 39.Laurie G.W. Bing J.T. Kleinman H.K. Hassell J.R. Aumailley M. Martin G.R. Feldmann R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). After dialysis, glycerol was added to a 50% final concentration. A fine mist from the mixture, sprayed by an airbrush (Paasche Type H), was sampled on freshly cleaved mica and shadowed under vacuum with platinum at an angle of about 6°C in a Balzer's Freeze Fracture Apparatus equipped with a rotating stage. Carbon-coated replicas were examined under an Hitachi H-500 electron microscope. Photographic negatives (× 30,000-60,000) were projected onto a table with a measuring cursor linked to a digitizer. Corrections were made at each magnification according to measurements of a standard diffraction grating. To further validate the method, rabbit tropomyosin was analyzed in parallel in several experiments. Samples for CD were dialyzed three times in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.2 mM DTT, and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. We observed that nondenatured BP-1A which had been subjected to repetitive freezing and thawing showed substantial absorbance above 310 nm (data not shown) which could be ascribed to light scattering as a result of protein aggregation(40.Leach S.J. Scheraga H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 4790-4792Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, CD was performed only on protein samples not previously frozen. The concentration of BP-1A was determined following the addition of 6 M guanidine HCl (41.Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2975) Google Scholar), based on a predicted amino acid composition of 17 tyrosines and 4 tryptophans/molecule. Values for protein concentration were also checked by amino acid analysis (Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A & M University). A quartz cell (Hellma, Mulheim, FRG) of 1-mm path length was used for CD, and the spectrum was recorded on a J-600 Jasco Spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co. LTD). Spectra represent the average of four accumulations at 0.2 nm/step. Coiled-coil predictions for BPAG1, DPI, and plectin were obtained by the method of Lupas et al.(42.Lupas A. van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar). Protein sequences were retrieved from GenBank or EMBL. Two polypeptides encompassing the predicted structural transitions from the N-terminal homology domain to the central α-helical coiled-coil rod portion of BPAG1 were expressed in E. coli (see Table 1). One of these polypeptides, BP-1, could be renatured in a largely soluble form with a small number of lower molecular weight impurities (Fig. 1A) after extraction in 8 M urea from bacterial inclusion bodies (lane a), purification on DEAE-cellulose (lane b), and dialysis from urea (lane c). The migration of BP-1 on SDS gels is consistent with a predicted molecular mass of 111 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane c). A second purified polypeptide, BP-1A, was constructed by an N-terminal deletion of 186 amino acids from BP-1 (see Table 1). In contrast to BP-1, BP-1A was expressed in the cytosol of lysed E. coli. BP-1A isolated following ion exchange and gel filtration appeared to be >95% pure (Fig. 1B, lane c), and this was confirmed by laser scanning densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels. A high molecular weight contaminant, which represents <5% of total protein (Fig. 1B, lane c), could not be removed by ammonium sulfate precipitation or hydroxylapatite chromatography. Other polypeptides from this region of BPAG1 were expressed at high levels in E. coli, but none could be satisfactorily purified and characterized(55.Tang, H.-Y. 1993 Ph.D thesis, Texas A & M UniversityGoogle Scholar). Further purification of BP-1 and BP-1A by heat treatment was attempted since many water-soluble coiled-coil proteins, such as tropomyosin and light meromyosin, renature spontaneously when cooled following heating to 95°C(43.Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Heald R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9730-9735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44.McNally E. Sohn R. Frankel S. Leinwand L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 368-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both BP-1 and BP-1A precipitated out of solution when heat-denatured (Fig. 2). Horowitz and co-workers (45.Tandon S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4486-4491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that a detergent, such as Zwittergent 3-16, when near its critical micelle concentration, can facilitate native protein folding during rapid renaturation by binding to exposed hydrophobic surfaces that otherwise induce aggregation. In the presence of 0.1 mg/ml Zwittergent 3-16, BP-1 and BP-1A renature primarily to soluble forms (Fig. 2) following heat treatment. While overall protein purity is not improved by this procedure, the detergent requirement for renaturation of BP-1 and BP-1A following heat treatment is consistent with the presence of complex globular folding domains in addition to the predicted α-helical coiled-coil. BP-1A comigrates with bovine serum albumin (s20,w0 = 4.4, mass = 68 kDa) on velocity sucrose gradients as a single homogeneous peak (Fig. 3). BP-1 has a slightly higher estimated s20,w0 of 4.85 than BP-1A. Traces of the two proteins were found at the bottom of both of the sucrose gradients, but at such low levels (<5%) to suggest that aggregation was not a major factor influencing their behavior. The two proteins also eluted before much higher molecular weight globular standards on Superose 6 gel filtration, suggesting that BP-1 and BP-1A have highly asymmetric or elongated structures. The Stokes radii of BP-1 and BP-1A are greater than both thyroglobulin and fibrinogen but smaller than the spectrin dimer (Fig. 4) and were estimated to be 115-121 Å and 111 Å, respectively. Solution molecular weights of BP-1 and BP-1A were inferred from the measured sedimentation coefficients and Stokes radii as 235 kDa and 195 kDa. Both proteins thus appear to associate in solution as dimers, consistent with formation of α-helical coiled-coil. In addition, each is predicted to have an axial ratio of >20:1 (Table 2). Gel filtration of highly asymmetric proteins such as these on Sepharose 4B has been reported to underestimate actual Stokes radii when globular standards are used for calibration(46.Nozaki Y. Schechter N.M. Reynolds J.A. Tanford C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the elution of the asymmetric protein standards fibrinogen and dimeric human erythrocyte spectrin correlated well with the three globular protein standards on Superose 6 (Fig. 4), and, therefore, the estimates of Stokes radius for BP-1 and BP-1A on Superose 6 appear to be valid. To evaluate both the existence and the extent of the predicted α-helical coiled-coil domain in BPAG1, we performed rotary shadowing on both BP-1 and BP-1A. Rotary-shadowed images of BP-1 and BP-1A were rod-like with an apparent globular structure at one end; a sample field of BP-1A is shown in Fig. 5a. The knob-like or globular end is more readily visible on BP-1 (Fig. 5, b and c) than on BP-1A (Fig. 5, d, e, and f) as expected since BP-1 is larger and contains a greater proportion of the N-terminal homology region. The lengths of the rod-like regions of both proteins were measured from images having a clearly defined knob at one end and are distributed in a Gaussian fashion: 60 ± 9 nm (N = 185) for BP-1 and 55 ± 8 nm (N = 159) for BP-1A (Fig. 6). The length of rabbit tropomyosin was measured to be 44 ± 4 nm (N = 111), which gives a predicted length that is within the range determined recently by x-ray diffraction (47.Whitby F.G. Kent H. Stewart F. Stewart M. Xie X. Hatch V. Cohen C. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and confirms the accuracy of our technique. The knob-like regions were variable in size, however"

The 20 or more potential expression sites for a VSG gene are invariably situated near a telomere, whereas the transcriptionally silent VSG genes are scattered throughout the chromosomes. The mechanisms that activate one and only one of these telomere-linked expression sites at a time in a given trypanosome are only partially understood. In some cases, activation is associated either with duplicative transposition of a silent donor VSG gene to a telomeric-linked expression site or with a telomere exchange event. In other cases, a silent VSG gene already at a telomere-linked site is activated in situ without apparent DNA rearrangement (for recent reviews, see (1.Donelson J.E. J. Biol.

Transcription of at least some telomere-linked VSG expression sites is initiated 45-60 kb upstream of the VSG gene and proceeds through as many as nine or 10 members of different gene families called expression site-associated genes (ESAGs). The resultant polycistronic pre-mRNA is processed into individual mRNAs by 5′ trans-splicing and 3′ polyadenylation(4.Kooter J.M. van der Spek H.J. Wagter R. d'Oliveira C.E. van der Hoeven F.

The steady state levels of the ESAG mRNAs are as much as 100-700-fold less than that of the VSG mRNA, indicating that expression of these co-transcribed genes is regulated at least in part by post-transcriptional events such as pre-mRNA processing and/or mRNA stability(8.Cully D.F. Ip H.S. Cross G.A.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The different ESAGs in an expression site are distinguished from one another by numbers or Roman numerals. ESAG-1 (or ESAG-I) is designated as the first gene preceding the VSG gene, and in general the larger the number or numeral, the further upstream within the expression site the ESAG is (the exception being ESAG-8, which lies between ESAG-3 and −4(3.Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Most of the 31-kb sequence of the AnTat 1.3A VSG gene expression site has been reported(3.Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol.

The functions of the other ESAG products encoded in this expression site remain to be elucidated. The ESAG-I family was the first ESAG family to be discovered(8.Cully D.F. Ip H.S. Cross G.A.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 10.Cully D.F. Gibbs C.P. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Its 14-25 members encode amphiphilic glycoproteins of about 46 kDa whose function and cellular location are not known(10.Cully D.F. Gibbs C.P. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11.Barnes D.A. Mottram J.C. Agabian N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 41: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the genomic sequence of an ESAG-I that is located several kb upstream of the VSG gene expressed by the MVAT4 trypanosome clone(12.Son H.J. Cook G.A. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A promoter has been found to occur between the ESAG-I and the VSG gene in this telomere-linked expression site(13.Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on assays, primer extension experiments, and reporter gene transfections all indicate that this promoter initiates synthesis of a monocistronic pre-mRNA encoding only one protein, the VSG. No additional open reading frame occurs in this pre-mRNA, suggesting that the upstream ESAG-I must be part of another transcription unit, if indeed it is transcribed at all. To resolve the question of whether the upstream ESAG-I is expressed in MVAT4 trypanosomes, we isolated two dozen ESAG-I cDNAs from an MVAT4 cDNA library. We discovered that none of these cDNAs were identical to the ESAG-I upstream of the MVAT4 VSG gene. This finding led to the study described here, which demonstrates that many different ESAG-Is are transcribed in bloodstream trypanosomes by an α-amanitin-sensitive RNA polymerase and suggests that the term “expression site-associated gene” may be a misnomer for this gene family. Bloodstream trypanosome clones MVAT4, MVAT5-Rx2, MVAT7, WRATat1.1, and WRATat1.19 from the WRATat serodeme of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense(14.Esser K.M. Schoenbechler M.J. Gingrich J.B. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1715-1718PubMed Google Scholar) were grown and isolated from rats as described previously(13.Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell.

Alarcon C.M. Hall T. Reddy L.V. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3971-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The WRATat1.1 trypanosome clone is the progenitor of the other clones. The MVAT4, MVAT5-Rx2, and MVAT7 bloodstream clones express VSGs that are also expressed by metacyclic stage trypanosomes(17.Fredman P. Richert N.D. Magnani J.L. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11206-11210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The clones were shown by immunofluorescence to be at least 99% pure with respect to the VSG being expressed. Procyclic trypanosomes derived from bloodstream clones MVAT7 or MVAT5-Rx2 were maintained in culture as described(13.Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell.

The nuclei of procyclic or bloodstream trypanosomes were isolated using a protocol kindly provided by Etienne Pays and described previously (13.Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell.

They were thawed and incubated with [α-32P]UTP, and their RNAs were isolated for use as probes in Southern blots as described(13.Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In some experiments α-amanitin (500 μg/ml) was added to the nuclei prior to incubation. The bloodstream T. brucei rhodesiense cDNA libraries were constructed in λ ZAP (Stratagene) as described earlier for the MVAT4 cDNA library(20.El-Sayed N.M. Alarcon C.M. Beck J.C. Sheffield V.C. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The libraries were screened with 32P-labeled probe A (see Fig. 2) using standard procedures (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) under the following moderately stringent hybridization and washing conditions: 42°C for 16 h with the labeled probe in 50% formamide, 6 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA followed by a single washing at 45°C for 1 h in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS.

Probes A-F shown in Fig. 2 were generated by either polymerase chain reaction amplification or restriction enzyme digestions. Hybridization probes were labeled with 32P using the random priming method(24.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). DNA sequences in plasmids were determined by a combination of manual sequencing (25.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52743) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and automated sequencing using an ABI 373 automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Sequences were aligned using the HIBIO MacIntosh DNASIS program (Hitachi) and the CLUSTAL algorithm(26.Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2881) Google Scholar). The telomere-linked expression sites for the genes encoding the MVAT4 VSG and the WRATat1.1/1.19 VSG were characterized in earlier experiments (13.Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 39.Kepa, J. K. 1990 The Characterization of a T.b. rhodesiense VSG Gene before and after Passage through the Tsetse Fly, Ph.D. thesis, University of IowaGoogle Scholar) and are shown in Fig. 1. MVAT4 bloodstream trypanosomes express a metacyclic VSG gene without apparent DNA rearrangement from a promoter located about 2 kb upstream of the VSG gene's start codon. An ESAG-I situated about 3 kb upstream of this promoter will be referred to as MVAT4 ESAG-I. Nuclear run-on experiments have demonstrated that most, if not all, of the 3 kb intergenic region between MVAT4 ESAG-I and the promoter is not transcribed(13.Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). WRATat1.1 and WRATat1.19 are separately isolated trypanosome clones expressing the same bloodstream VSG gene, also without apparent DNA rearrangement. WRATat1.19 was originally cloned from a mouse infected by tsetse flies, which had ingested WRATat1.1 trypanosomes. In both WRATat1.1 and WRATat1.19, the expressed VSG gene is preceded by a barren region of 25 kb or more that is comprised predominately of 76-bp repeats. The promoter for this VSG gene has not been identified but nuclear run-on assays using ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated nuclei from WRATat1.1 indicated that it is located far upstream of the gene and perhaps in front of the 76-bp repeats. Thus, this expression site resembles other bloodstream VSG expression sites whose primary transcripts have been shown to be 45-60 kb in length(3.Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Kooter J.M. van der Spek H.J. Wagter R. d'Oliveira C.E. van der Hoeven F. Johnson P.J. Borst P.

Cell. 1989; 57: 835-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It is not known if an ESAG-I is located in front of this barren region or if one is represented in the very long primary transcript encoding the WRATat1.1/1.19 VSG. To examine the expression of ESAG-Is in these trypanosomes, the 660-bp probe A indicated in Figure 1:, Figure 2: was used to screen cDNA libraries constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of each of these three trypanosome clones. When 70,000 clones in the MVAT4 cDNA library were screened, 24 clones were identified (0.034%). Since about 4% of the cDNAs in the same library encode the MVAT4 VSG, the ratio of ESAG-I cDNAs to MVAT4 VSG cDNAs in this library is 0.034:4 or about 1:120. Likewise, the WRATat1.1 and WRATat1.19 cDNA libraries were found to contain a similar ratio of ESAG-I cDNAs to VSG cDNAs. The 24 ESAG-I cDNAs from a MVAT4 cDNA library and four additional ESAG-I cDNAs (two each from WRATat1.1 and WRATat1.19 cDNA libraries) were chosen for further study. Partial sequence determinations of the 24 ESAG-I cDNAs from the MVAT4 cDNA library revealed that 20 possessed unique coding sequences, none of which was identical to MVAT4 ESAG-I. Thus, a minimum of 20 different ESAG-I mRNA species occur in MVAT4 trypanosomes, and it seems likely that additional unique ESAG-I cDNAs could be found if the library were rescreened and more positive clones were sequenced. The complete sequences of 11 of the 24 cDNAs were determined (Fig. 2). The complete sequences of the remaining 13 cDNAs were not determined because their partial sequences indicated that they were very similar to at least one of the other sequences. As it turned out, 2 of the 11 cDNAs were found to be identical (collectively called ESAG-Ik in Fig. 2), and another two differ only in the lengths of their 3′-UTRs (ESAG-Ic and ESAG-Ij in Fig. 2). In addition, the complete sequences of the four ESAG-I cDNAs from the other two libraries were determined and were also found to have nucleotide differences. These 14 distinct ESAG-I cDNAs are compared schematically in Fig. 2 along with the MVAT4 ESAG-I coding sequence. The 14 cDNAs are called ESAG-Ia to -In, with ESAG-Ia being chosen as the reference sequence for the sake of comparison because it is the longest sequence determined. As is readily apparent from Fig. 2, some ESAG-I cDNAs are more similar to each other than are others. For example, ESAG-Ia to -Ij have very similar coding regions, but only the coding regions of ESAG-Ic and ESAG-Ij are identical. Among these 10 ESAG-Is, the first four share long 3′-UTRs (>1 kb) that are very similar, the fifth has a related intermediately sized 3′-UTR, and the next three (ESAG-If, -Ig, and -Ih) share an unrelated short 3′-UTR (207 bp) whose divergence extends into the last 16 codons of the coding region. The last two cDNAs among this common group of 10 have either a very short 3′-UTR of 15 bp (ESAG-Ii) or completely lack a 3′-UTR (ESAG-Ij). In the latter case, the last residue of the termination codon, TGA, is the first residue of the poly(A) tail. Five of these 10 common cDNAs have an interior termination codon (indicated by the black dot in Fig. 2 and corresponding to codon 106 of ESAG-Ia) that disrupts the open reading frame, suggesting they are derived from pseudogenes. At least one other ESAG-I sequence with an internal termination codon has been reported (27.Alexandre S. Guyaux M. Murphy N.B. Coquelet H. Pays A. Steinert M. Pays E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2367-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ESAG-Ik appears to be a hybrid ESAG; the 5′-half resembles the above group of 10, whereas the 3′-half, including the 3′-UTR, is divergent. Another unexpected feature of this group of 10 ESAG-I cDNAs is that some of those whose 5′-ends extend to the 5′-spliced leader do not possess the usual ATG start codon. Instead, they have the codon ATA at this position (small black rectangles in Fig. 2). Although it is not known if the corresponding AUA in the RNA can serve to initiate protein synthesis in trypanosomes, this triplet can function as a start codon in prokaryotes and mitochondria(28.Poulis M.I. Shaw D.C. Campbell H.D. Young I.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4178-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29.Belin D. Hedgpeth J. Selzer G.B. Epstein R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30.Barrell B.G. Bankier A.T. Drowin J. Nature. 1979; 282: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Whether it can serve as a start codon in eukaryotes probably depends on the flanking nucleotides (31.Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and remains to be demonstrated in trypanosomes. In contrast, ESAG-Il, ESAG-Im, and the MVAT4 ESAG-I have the conventional ATG start codon. The last three cDNAs shown in Fig. 2(ESAG-Il, -Im, and -In) differ more substantially in sequence, both among each other and from the other ESAG-Is, than do the first 11. These differences are represented by the differently patterned segments. ESAG-Il has a 3′-UTR consisting of a single cytosine between the termination codon TGA and the poly(A) tail. MVAT4 ESAG-I, the last sequence represented in Fig. 2, is also quite divergent from any of the above 14 cDNAs. Fig. 3 displays the deduced amino acid sequences for the eight most divergent ESAG-I coding regions, again with ESAG-Ia as the reference sequence. Three general features are apparent from this amino acid alignment. First, the N-terminal halves of the ESAG-I coding sequences are clearly more similar than are the C-terminal halves, an observation made previously for a smaller number of ESAG-I sequences (8.Cully D.F. Ip H.S. Cross G.A.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11.Barnes D.A. Mottram J.C. Agabian N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 41: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 12.Son H.J. Cook G.A. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The only exception to this rule is ESAG-Id (second line in Fig. 3), which displays more divergence from ESAG-Ia in the front half than in the back half. Thus, from a functional standpoint, the more highly conserved N-terminal half appears to tolerate fewer changes than the C-terminal half. The second apparent feature is that individual ESAG-Is often differ from each other in small blocks of amino acids. Correspondingly, two or more ESAG-Is may share a block of 2-10 amino acids that the other ESAG-Is do not have. This result suggests that ESAG-I family members may undergo occasional internal cross-over events among themselves, diversifying their sequences. An example of this possibility is ESAG-Ik, whose N-terminal half closely resembles the common group of 10 and whose C-terminal half is clearly derived from a different sequence that nevertheless has within it some conserved blocks of amino acids. Another illustration comes from a comparison of ESAG-Im and ESAG-In, two of the more highly divergent ESAG-Is whose amino acid sequences are much more similar in their N-terminal halves than in their C-terminal halves. Finally, six of the eight cysteines in ESAG-Ia are conserved in all of the ESAG-Is, and some are conserved within highly divergent regions, suggesting that these cysteines may play an important structural or functional role. Fig. 4A shows Northern blots of RNAs from procyclic trypanosomes (lane P) and from bloodstream trypanosome clones MVAT4 and MVAT7 (lanes 4 and 7). The blots are probed with three probes indicated in Fig. 2 and a tubulin probe. Probe B is a representative of the coding sequence shared by the common group of 10 cDNAs described above. Probe C represents the long 3′-UTR possessed by a subset of this common group, and probe D is the divergent 3′-half of ESAG-Ik. Probe B hybridizes to two RNA size classes, one of 2.3 kb and one of 1.3 kb. If the poly(A) tail accounts for about 0.2 kb, the two classes correspond in size to the ESAG-I cDNAs in the common group of 10 that have either the long 3′-UTR (ESAG-Ia to -Id) or the unrelated short 3′-UTR (ESAG-If to -Ih). In some lanes an intermediately sized band can be seen that likely corresponds to ESAG-Ie, which has an intermediately sized 3′-UTR. No hybridization to procyclic RNA was detected, even under very long exposure times. Thus, the steady state level of ESAG-I RNA is much higher in bloodstream parasites than in procyclic organisms. Probe C does not hybridize to the 1.3-kb RNA, supporting the above interpretation that this RNA size class corresponds to ESAG-I cDNAs lacking this long 3′-UTR. Probe C does hybridize to the 2.3-kb RNA, as expected, and also hybridizes to a larger RNA species not recognized by probe B. The significance of this larger RNA is uncertain. Perhaps all or part of the probe C sequence occurs in an RNA species that does not have an ESAG-I coding region or has an ESAG-I coding region that has diverged enough to not cross-hybridize with probe B under the moderately stringent conditions used. Since a representative of this larger RNA species was not among the cDNAs examined, its presence was not studied further. Probe D recognizes an RNA slightly smaller than 1.3 kb, as expected from the size of its cDNA (Fig. 2). The tubulin probe (which does not have small amounts of vector sequence that hybridize to the marker DNAs as do the other probes) generates signals of similar intensities in the other three lanes, showing that similar amounts of RNA were loaded in each lane. Fig. 4B shows that similar hybridization patterns are obtained when RNAs from the bloodstream WRATat1.1 and WRATat1.19 trypanosome clones are probed with fragments B and C. Thus, multiple ESAG-I mRNA species are present in these trypanosome clones as well, consistent with the finding that the four ESAG-I cDNAs examined from the WRATat1.1 and WRATat1.19 cDNA libraries are all different. Since the expression site for the 1.1/1.19 VSG is transcribed into a long polycistronic pre-mRNA, the presence of multiple, heterogeneous ESAG-I transcripts is not an aberration of active expression sites transcribed into a monocistronic VSG pre-mRNAs. When probe A (the MVAT4 ESAG-I) was used in Northern blots under the same hybridization stringency conditions, no detectable signal was observed to either bloodstream or procyclic RNAs, even after long exposure times (not shown). This result is consistent with the fact that none of the 24 ESAG-I cDNAs isolated from the MVAT4 cDNA library encode the MVAT4 ESAG-I. Thus, if MVAT4 ESAG-I RNA is present in MVAT4 trypanosomes, it is at a level too low to detect on Northern blots and at best represents only a few percent of the total ESAG-I RNA population in MVAT4 organisms. Fig. 5 shows Southern blots of genomic DNAs from MVAT4, MVAT7 and WRATat1.1 trypanosomes hybridized to probes B, C, and F. EcoRI and HindIII were used to digest the DNAs because none of the ESAG-I cDNA sequences possess their cleavage sites. The hybridization patterns were identical for all three genomes with all of the probes tested, providing no evidence for DNA rearrangements among the ESAG-Is. Probe B (coding region of the common 10) recognizes at least eight HindIII fragments, one of which is much more intense than the others, suggesting that either multiple copies of this particular fragment exist or multiple genes occur within the fragment. Probe C (long 3′-UTR) hybridizes to a subset of the EcoRI and HindIII fragments to which probe B binds, as expected if this 3′-UTR is encoded by only some of the genes recognized by probe B. Probe F, which should recognize another subset of these same genes, generates a simple banding pattern but appears to detect an EcoRI and HindIII fragment not recognized by probe B. The interpretation of this result is not clear, but it suggests that at least one copy of the probe F sequence in the genome might be flanked by a region other than the probe B sequence. Nuclear run-on assays were used to detect the nascent transcripts of the ESAG-Is. Radiolabeled run-on RNAs from nuclei of procyclic and bloodstream trypanosomes incubated in the presence or absence of α-amanitin were used to probe the ESAG-I coding region. Transcription from the VSG and PARP gene expression sites is known to be resistant to α-amanitin, suggesting that these expression sites are transcribed by RNA polymerase I or a modified RNA polymerase II(32.Rudenko G. Chung H-M.M. Pham V.P. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3387-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33.Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. Kieft R. Borst P. Nature. 1991; 353: 772-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The procyclic portion of Fig. 6(left panel) shows the results when procyclic run-on RNA was used as the probe. As expected, procyclic RNA synthesized in the absence of α-amanitin (panel C) hybridizes to the PARP and tubulin genes but not to the VSG gene. It also hybridizes with a reduced signal to probe B (the coding region of the common ten) but not to probe A (MVAT4 ESAG-I coding region). This result indicates that at least some of the ESAG-Is are transcribed in procyclic organisms even though procyclic ESAG-I RNA was not detected on Northern blots. When α-amanitin was present during the procyclic nuclei incubation (panel B), transcription of the PARP genes was unaffected but transcription of the genes for tubulin and ESAG-I was greatly reduced, indicating that the ESAG-Is are transcribed by a conventional RNA polymerase II, similar to the tubulin genes but distinct from the PARP and VSG genes. The bloodstream portion of Fig. 6(right panel) shows a similar experiment using run-on RNA from bloodstream MVAT4 nuclei. In the absence of α-amanitin this RNA hybridizes strongly to the MVAT4 VSG and weakly to probe B. Thus, the single MVAT4 VSG gene is transcribed at a much higher rate than are the multiple ESAG-Is, consistent with the 120:1 ratio of their respective cDNAs in the MVAT4 cDNA library. Again, no hybridization to probe A was detected, consistent with the finding that transcripts of MVAT4 ESAG-I are only a small fraction of the pool of heterogeneous ESAG-I RNAs in MVAT4 trypanosomes, if indeed they even exist at all. The α-amanitin had no effect on VSG gene transcription, as expected, but diminished transcription of the ESAG-Is to an undetectable level, indicating that the MVAT4 VSG gene and the ESAG-Is are transcribed by different RNA polymerase complexes. The run-on RNAs were also used to probe other unique regions within the collection of ESAG-I cDNAs (not shown). Although the strongest signals were obtained to the probe B sequence, consistent with its presence in more than half of the ESAG-I cDNAs, weak α-amanitin-sensitive signals were also obtained to probes C and D and to fragments unique to ESAG-Il, -Im, and -In. Recent reviews on the molecular mechanisms of trypanosome antigenic variation, including one from this lab(1.Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7783-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), invariably refer to ESAG-Is as genes that are co-transcribed with the VSG gene in the active VSG gene expression site. In MVAT4 trypanosomes this clearly is not the situation. No evidence was obtained for the expression of MVAT4 ESAG-I in MVAT4 organisms. None of the ESAG-I cDNAs had the same sequence as MVAT4 ESAG-I (Figure 1:, Figure 2:), nuclear run-on RNA from MVAT4 nuclei did not hybridize to MVAT4 ESAG-I (Fig. 6), and Northern blots probed with the MVAT4 ESAG-I probe (probe A) did not detect a transcript. Thus, if MVAT4 ESAG-I is expressed in MVAT4 organisms, its mRNA is a very small fraction of the total pool of heterogeneous ESAG-I mRNAs and too rare to detect by conventional techniques. A possible explanation for this unexpected finding is that the monocistronic MVAT4 expression site is not representative of the polycistronic expression sites identified for at least some other bloodstream VSG genes(3.Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Kooter J.M. van der Spek H.J. Wagter R. d'Oliveira C.E. van der Hoeven F. Johnson P.J. Borst P.

Cell. 1989; 57: 835-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, the expression site for the WRATat1.1/1.19 VSG gene does resemble these other polycistronic VSG expression sites, and WRATat1.1/1.19 trypanosomes likewise contain a heterogeneous population of ESAG-I mRNAs. Indeed, Northern blots (Fig. 4) suggest that four different trypanosome clones (MVAT4, MVAT7, WRATat1.1, and WRATat1.19) express essentially the same array of different ESAG-Is. Yet, in those cases where an ESAG-I does occur within the polycistronic transcription unit of a VSG gene expression site, its RNA sequence is the predominant ESAG-I mRNA in that trypanosome clone(8.Cully D.F. Ip H.S. Cross G.A.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation of these results is that an expressed ESAG-I need not be in a telomere-linked VSG gene expression site, but it does no harm if it is there. Perhaps ESAG-Is become part of a telomere-linked, polycistronic expression site only if they inadvertently land there as a partner in a recombination event such as a transposon-mediated transposition, a VSG gene conversion, or some other DNA rearrangement event. Our preliminary characterizations of genomic DNA clones containing ESAG-Is suggest that they are scattered about the genome, sometimes in clusters of at least four gene copies, and Southern blots of CHEF gels probed with probes B and C indicate that they occur predominately on large chromosomes of 2,000 kb or more (not shown). In addition, Southern blots of restricted genomic DNA (Fig. 5) provide no evidence that they are near large barren regions such as the 76-bp repeats or telomeric repeats. Thus, although some members of the ESAG-I family are located in a VSG expression site, others are not and manage to be transcribed from these other sites. The nuclear run-on assays (Fig. 6) indicated that the ESAG-Is are transcribed in both procyclic and bloodstream trypanosomes by an α-amanitin-sensitive RNA polymerase, in contrast to VSG genes whose RNA synthesis is resistant to α-amanitin. Yet Northern blots showed that the ESAG-I mRNAs accumulate to a detectable steady state level only in bloodstream trypanosomes, similar to the VSG mRNAs. These results are consistent with the earlier findings of Graham and Barry (34.Graham S.V. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 47: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), except they found that synthesis of ESAG-I transcripts in procyclic organisms was resistant to α-amanitin rather than sensitive. Although the reason for this difference is unclear, the distribution of ESAG-Is within the genome of the T. brucei 221 clone used in their work is undoubtedly different from that in our trypanosome clones, so at least some ESAG-Is of the two respective serodemes could be on different transcription units in procyclic organisms. In the case of VSG mRNAs, their semiconserved 3′-UTRs are crucial in conferring the bloodstream stage specificity to the VSG mRNAs (35.Berberof M. Vanhamme L. Tebabi P. Pays A. Jefferies D. Welburn S. Pays E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, at least five different general groupings of 3′-UTR sequences exist among the heterogeneous ESAG-I cDNAs described here (represented in ESAG-Ia, -If, -Ik, -Im, and -In). Our attempts to identify substantive sequence similarities among these five main 3′-UTR groupings via either pairwise alignments or a group alignment of all five were not particularly revealing. The longest stretch of sequence identity among all five is five bp. The maximum sequence identity between any two of the five groups is 17 of 23 positions. Still other poly(A)+ ESAG-I cDNAs were found to have 3′-UTRs of only 15, 1, or 0 nucleotides, suggesting but not proving that the 3′-UTR is not responsible for the bloodstream stage-specific stability of the ESAG-I mRNAs as it is for VSG mRNAs. One possibility for the existence of these unique ESAG-I 3′-UTR sequences is that they might confer different properties to the ESAG-I RNAs within bloodstream trypanosomes, such as different half-lives, specific cytoplasmic compartmentalization, or differential expression in stumpy and slender forms. Another possibility is that their bloodstream stage-specificity could be conferred, not by the 3′-UTRs but by sequences within a conserved segment of the more highly conserved N-terminal coding regions. It should be possible to test these and other models for the bloodstream stage specificity of ESAG-I mRNAs using transient transfections with a reporter gene containing different segments of the ESAG-I coding regions and 3′-UTRs. The small blocks of identity and/or dissimilarity among some of the deduced ESAG-I amino acid sequences (Fig. 3) are reminiscent of similar properties of a few duplicated VSG genes(36.Kamper S.M. Barbet A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 53: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 37.Pays E. Houard S. Pays A. Van Assel S. Dupont F. Aerts D. Huet-Duvillier G. Gomes V. Richet C.

Genes & Dev. 1990; 9: 1374-1383Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In those VSG examples, the newly duplicated VSG gene is a mosaic of segments from two or more closely related donor VSG isogenes and is likely created by multiple cross-over events among the isogenes during duplication. Sometimes, these donor VSG genes are actually pseudogenes with internal termination codons that prohibit their own expression into protein but do not interfere with the conversion of other segments of their sequence into a new gene. Similar events could also scramble blocks of sequences among the multiple ESAG-Is and pseudogenes, leading to the patterns revealed in Figure 2:, Figure 3:. The function of the ESAG-I proteins remains an enigma. Their sequences and the rarity of their mRNAs suggest that they are minor surface proteins(3.Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Cully D.F. Ip H.S. Cross G.A.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), although attempts to verify their surface location using antibodies have been precluded by their low abundance(10.Cully D.F. Gibbs C.P. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The results described here do not shed new light on their possible functions but do demonstrate that their presence is not linked to a specific VSG or VSG gene expression site. In addition, the complete sequence conservation of some segments of their N-terminal halves and the complete conservation in all ESAG-Is of six of the eight cysteines in ESAG-Ia (see Fig. 3) suggest that, despite their heterogeneity and low abundance, ESAG-I proteins do serve a role for bloodstream trypanosomes. This is a role that apparently can be fulfilled by heterogeneous mixtures of related proteins rather than a homogeneous protein population such as is required for VSG function. The challenge now is to identify that ESAG-I role. We thank Kwang Kim for generously providing the MVAT7 RNA and DNA, Shiyong Li for conducting some of the early experiments, and the University of Iowa DNA Facility for automated DNA sequence determinations (National Institutes of Health Grant DK25295)."
https://openalex.org/W1581273245,"We have recently identified ferritin as a cellular protein particle whose synthesis is stimulated in mouse or human cells infected by the picornavirus Mengo(1.Mulvey M.R. Fang H. Holmes C.F.B. Scraba D.G. Virology. 1994; 198: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the particle from infected murine L929 cells showed a 4- and 6-fold increase in the intracellular concentrations of H and L apoferritin subunits, respectively. This differential expression altered the H/L subunit ratio from 3.0 in uninfected cells to 2.2 in Mengo virus-infected cells. The induction is not due to an increase in transcription of the apoferritin L and H genes, nor is it due to an increase in stability of the apoferritin mRNAs. At the level of translation, the iron regulatory protein (IRP) remained intact, with similar amounts being detected in uninfected and infected cells. The Mengo virus RNA genome does not compete with the iron regulatory element (IRE) for the binding of IRP, and sequence analysis confirmed that there are no IREs in the virus RNA. The IRE binding activity of IRP in infected cells decreased approximately 30% compared with uninfected cells. The decrease in binding activity could be overcome by the addition of Desferal (deferoxamine mesylate; CIBA) an intracellular iron chelator, which suggests that virus infection causes an increase in intracellular free iron. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies have confirmed the increase in free iron in Mengo virus infected cells. The permeability of cells for iron does not change in virus infected cells, suggesting that the induction of ferritin by Mengo virus is due to a change in the form of intracellular iron from a bound to a free state. We have recently identified ferritin as a cellular protein particle whose synthesis is stimulated in mouse or human cells infected by the picornavirus Mengo(1.Mulvey M.R. Fang H. Holmes C.F.B. Scraba D.G. Virology. 1994; 198: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the particle from infected murine L929 cells showed a 4- and 6-fold increase in the intracellular concentrations of H and L apoferritin subunits, respectively. This differential expression altered the H/L subunit ratio from 3.0 in uninfected cells to 2.2 in Mengo virus-infected cells. The induction is not due to an increase in transcription of the apoferritin L and H genes, nor is it due to an increase in stability of the apoferritin mRNAs. At the level of translation, the iron regulatory protein (IRP) remained intact, with similar amounts being detected in uninfected and infected cells. The Mengo virus RNA genome does not compete with the iron regulatory element (IRE) for the binding of IRP, and sequence analysis confirmed that there are no IREs in the virus RNA. The IRE binding activity of IRP in infected cells decreased approximately 30% compared with uninfected cells. The decrease in binding activity could be overcome by the addition of Desferal (deferoxamine mesylate; CIBA) an intracellular iron chelator, which suggests that virus infection causes an increase in intracellular free iron. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies have confirmed the increase in free iron in Mengo virus infected cells. The permeability of cells for iron does not change in virus infected cells, suggesting that the induction of ferritin by Mengo virus is due to a change in the form of intracellular iron from a bound to a free state."
https://openalex.org/W2159870370,"Mutation of Arg-15, Glu-19, Arg-22, and Thr-27 of porcine liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis. These residues are conserved in all known primary sequences of mammalian fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. On the basis of the crystal structure of the enzyme, Arg-15, Glu-19, and Arg-22 are located at the interface of the two dimers (C1-C2 and C3-C4), and Thr-27 is in the AMP binding site. The wild-type and mutant forms of the enzyme were purified to homogeneity and characterized by initial rate kinetics and circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry. No discernible differences were observed between the secondary structures of the wild-type and mutant forms of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase on the basis of CD data. Kinetic analyses revealed similar kcat values for mutants R15A, E19Q, R22K, and T27A of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; however, a 2-fold increase of kcat was observed with R22M compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. Small changes in Km values for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate were found in the five mutants. 4-6-fold decreases in Ki values for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and 5-9-fold decreases in the binding affinity of Mg2+ relative to the wild-type enzyme were exhibited by R15A and E19Q. No alteration of Mg2+ cooperativity was found in the five mutants. Significant changes in Ki values for AMP were obtained in the case of R22K (30-fold) and T27A (1300-fold) with a Hill coefficient of 2.0. Replacement of Arg-22 with methionine, however, caused the total loss of AMP cooperativity without changing AMP affinity.

INTRODUCTIONFructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.11), FBPase( 1The abbreviations used are: FBPasefructose-1,6-bisphosphataseFru-6-Pfructose 6-phosphateFru-1,6-P2fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.) ) is an allosteric enzyme located at a crucial control point in carbohydrate metabolism. In the presence of divalent metal ions, the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) to fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The reaction is noncompetitively inhibited by AMP and competitively inhibited by Fru-2,6-P2, and the action of these two inhibitors is synergistic(1.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9122-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi M.R. Claus T.H. Annu. Rev.

These two compounds are involved in the activation of phosphofructokinase (4.Hers H.-G. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and are responsible for the coordinated regulation of glycolysis and glyconeogenesis(5.Tejwani G.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar).FBPase is composed of four identical subunits, each of which contains a substrate and AMP binding domain separated by 28 Å, and metal binding sites in close proximity to the substrate binding site(7.Xue Y. Huang S. Liang J.-Y. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12482-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8.Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Zhang Y. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Proc.

Biol. 1989; 212: 513-539Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). AMP binding is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2 (10.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Stone S.R. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F.

In addition, AMP inhibition exhibits “half of the sites” reactivity(14.Levitzki A. Stallcup W.B. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3371-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cooperativity with respect to metal ion binding to FBPase has also been recognized(10.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Tashima Y. Yoshimura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 78: 1161-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The activity of FBPase, as a function of Mg2+ concentration, is sigmoidal at neutral pH but hyperbolic at pH 9.6. Furthermore, AMP and Mg2+ are mutually exclusive in their binding to the enzyme (10.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Scheffler J.E. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6659-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that an R- to T-state transition of FBPase is triggered by the binding of AMP, causing a shift of binding sites for metals to unfavorable positions (18.Villeret V. Huang S. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4307-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19.Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The mutation of residues at the metal binding sites of FBPase affects the Mg2+ and AMP affinity(20.Chen L. Hegde R. Chen M. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); however, significant changes in Mg2+ cooperativity and affinity and/or AMP affinity were also a consequence of the mutation of active site residues(21.Shyur L.F. Zhang R. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22.Zhang R. Chen L. Villeret V. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 54-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 23.Zhang R. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8190-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, AMP cooperativity is completely lost when Glu-29, a residue in the AMP domain, is replaced by Gln (24.Chen M. Chen L. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5554-5558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).X-ray diffraction studies of FBPase from porcine kidney have pinpointed a number of amino acid residues located at the interface of dimers that might contribute to cooperativity during the R- to T-state transition. In an attempt to associate functional properties of FBPase to specific interactions of the dimer interface, Arg-15, Glu-19, Arg-22, and Thr-27, which is located in the AMP binding site but interacts with Arg-22 in the T-state of FBPase, were the subjects of experiments in directed mutation. The kinetic properties of R15A, E19Q, R22K, R22M, and T27A were investigated. The most important finding of this investigation is that the replacement of Arg-22 with methionine causes a total loss of AMP cooperativity and increases the turnover number of the enzyme as measured by initial rate kinetics.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsFru-1,6-P2, Fru-2,6-P2, NADP, MgCl2, AMP, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside were purchased from Sigma. DNA-modifying and restriction enzymes were from Promega and Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucose isomerase were from Boehringer Mannheim. Other chemicals were of reagent grade or the equivalent.Mutagenesis of FBPaseMutations were accomplished by the introduction of specific base changes into a double-stranded plasmid (25.Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Five mutagenic primers, as shown in Table 1, were used to mutate Arg-15 → Ala, Glu-19 → Gln, Arg-22 → Lys, Arg-22 → Met, and Thr-27 → Ala. A selective primer is also shown in Table 1, which exchanged the original NruI site to a unique XhoI site on the pET-11a vector. The double-stranded FBPase expression plasmid (pET-FBP) and mutagenic and selective primers were denatured, annealed, and polymerized as described by Deng and Nickoloff (25.Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar).Table 1 Open table in a new tab Mutations were confirmed by NruI/XhoI digestion and by fluorescent dideoxy chain-termination sequencing at the Nucleic Acid Facility at Iowa State University. The mutagenesis plasmid was finally transformed into Escherichia coli DE 657, a strain deficient in the FBPase gene.FBPase PurificationThe expression and purification of wild-type, R15A, E19Q, R22K, and T27A enzymes were carried out as described previously(21.Shyur L.F. Zhang R. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26.Burton V.A. Chen M. Ong W-C Ling T. Fromm H.J. Stayton M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because R22M did not bind to the CM-Sephadex C-50 column, a Cibacron blue 3GA (from Sigma) column, equilibrated with 25 mM malonate (pH 6.0), was used in the final step. Homogeneous R22M was eluted from the Cibacron blue column by 1 M NaCl, 25 mM malonate (pH 6.0).Protein concentration was assayed as described by Bradford (27.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213043) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (from Sigma) as the standard. The protein purity was determined by using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Kinetic StudiesSpecific activity during purification was determined by the phosphoglucoisomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled spectrometric assay at either pH 7.5 or 9.6(10.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Ulm E.H. Pogell B.M. deMaine M.M. Libby C.B. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All other kinetic experiments were done at pH 7.5 (Hepes buffer) and 24°C by using a coupled spectrofluorometric assay(10.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial rate data were analyzed by using a computer program written in MINITAB language with an α value of 2.0(10.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Siano D.B. Zyskind J.W. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 170: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cooperativity was evaluated by using either the ENZFITTER program (30.Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A Non-linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC. Elsevier Science Publishers BV, Cambridge/United Kingdom1987: 13-75Google Scholar) or the MINITAB program.Circular Dichroism SpectrometryCD studies on the wild-type and mutant forms of FBPase were carried out in a Jasco J710 CD spectrometer in a 1-mm cell at room temperature. Spectra were collected from 200 to 260 nm in 1.3-nm increments, and each spectrum was blank corrected and smoothed by using the software package provided with the instrument.Model BuildingModels for the mutants of FBPase were built using coordinates of the wild-type enzyme complexed with AMP (Protein Data Bank file 4FBP). The side chains of Arg-22 of subunit C1 and C4 were replaced with either methionine or lysine so that their torsion angle values were identical to those of arginine. Afterward, the models, including that of the wild type, were energy minimized using the program CHARMm of QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Inc.).RESULTSEnzyme PurityEnzyme purity of wild-type and the five mutant forms of porcine liver FBPase was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Identical relative mobilities and homogeneities (≥96%) were found for these enzymes by using electrophoresis as a criterion. The pH 7.5/9.6 activity ratios shown in Table 2, along with the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results, suggest that the enzymes had not undergone proteolysis(28.Ulm E.H. Pogell B.M. deMaine M.M. Libby C.B. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Table 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Initial Rate StudiesTo evaluate the effects of mutations on residues at the interface of FBPase, kinetic studies were undertaken on the wild-type and mutant forms of the enzyme. The kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Most of the data in Table 2 were obtained by measuring the initial rate at saturating Fru-1,6-P2 or 5 mM Mg2+, a concentration that does not cause substrate inhibition. It can be seen from Table 2 that mutation of Arg-22 to methionine increased the enzyme activity. The mutant has a 2.1-fold higher kcat value than that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the Km for Fru-1,6-P2 was similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. Specific activity and Km values for Fru-1,6-P2 were similar for R15A, R22K, and wild-type FBPase. Small decreases in Fru-1,6-P2Km were found in E19Q (2.6-fold) and T27A (3.5-fold) relative to wild-type FBPase.Mg2+ Ion CooperativityThe activity of FBPase responds sigmoidally to Mg2+ concentration at neutral pH with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2(12.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15.Tashima Y. Yoshimura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 78: 1161-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, the Hill coefficient for Mg2+ of the wild-type and mutant forms of FBPase were determined at their saturating Fru-1,6-P2 concentrations (12-50 μM). The Ka values for Mg2+ of these enzymes were determined by using an initial rate equation (), which is based on a steady-state Random Bi Bi sequential kinetic model for the following reasons: (a) at pH 9.5, the kinetic mechanism for mammalian FBPase is rapid equilibrium Random Bi Bi(10.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (b) the crystal structure of the enzyme suggests that only one Mg2+ ion binds per subunit, yet the Hill coefficient for Mg2+ is 2, (c) cooperativity is not observed for Fru-1,6-P2, and (d) at saturating levels of Mg2+, the reverse reaction is steady-state Random Bi Bi (11.Stone S.R. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The complex rate equation obtained for the steady-state Random Bi Bi model can be reduced to by making assumptions regarding the various rate constants in the kinetic model(31.Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6611-6619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. J. Theor. Biol. 1973; 39: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The form of is as follows: where v, Vm, A, B, Ka, Kb, and Kia represent initial velocity, maximal velocity, the concentration of free Mg2+, the concentration of free Fru-1,6-P2, the Michaelis constant for Mg2+, the Michaelis constant for Fru-1,6-P2, and the dissociation constant for Mg2+, respectively, and where n represents the cooperativity for Mg2+ with FBPase. Table 2 shows that wild-type and the five mutants possess similar Hill coefficients for Mg2+. Mg2+ activation of the enzymes was sigmoidal in all cases (data not shown). The kinetic data for these enzymes also gave excellent fits to with n = 2. On the basis of these results, it is probable that Arg-15, Glu-19, Arg-22, and Thr-27 may not be directly involved in the Mg2+ cooperativity. A 2-, 5-, and 9-fold increase in Ka values for Mg2+ were found in T27A, E19Q, and R15A, respectively, relative to wild-type FBPase.Fru-2,6-P2 InhibitionFru-2,6-P2 is a competitive inhibitor of FBPase and competes with the substrate (Fru-1,6-P2) for the active site of the enzyme(33.Sola M.M. Oliver F.J. Salto R. Gutierrez M. Vargas A.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 1963-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 34.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol.

Mutation of active site residues, Asn-212, Arg-243, Tyr-244, Tyr-264, and Lys-274, causes dramatic changes in Fru-1,6-P2 and Fru-2,6-P2 affinity (21.Shyur L.F. Zhang R. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 37.El-Maghrabi M.R. Austin L.R. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6526-6530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that these residues are important in allowing FBPase to discriminate between the substrate and inhibitor. Table 2 shows that the Ki values for Fru-2,6-P2 for R15A and E19Q were increased 4- and 6-fold, respectively, compared with the wild-type enzyme, and only small changes were observed for R22K, R22M, and T27A. These findings suggest that the five mutants do not play a significant role in the competitive binding observed for Fru-1,6-P2 and Fru-2,6-P2.Kinetics of AMP InhibitionAMP, a nonlinear noncompetitive inhibitor of FBPase, exhibits sigmoidal binding with a Hill coefficient approximately of 2.0(11.Stone S.R. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13.Taketa K. Pogell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of our investigations, AMP inhibition is nonlinear and noncompetitive with respect to Fru-1,6-P2 but nonlinear and competitive relative to Mg2+ for wild-type FBPase(10.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates a double-reciprocal plot of 1/velocity versus 1/(Mg2+)2 in the presence and absence of AMP for the R22K mutant of FBPase. The data in Fig. 1 gave excellent fits to when n = 2. The form of is as follows: Figure 1:Plot of reciprocal of initial velocity in arbitrary fluorescent units versus reciprocal of [Mg2+]2 for R22K FBPase. The concentrations of AMP are 0 (▪), 2.0 μM (+), 3.0 μM (▴), and 4.5 μM (□). The coupled spectrofluorescence assay was performed at 25°C in 50 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 M KCl, 10 μM Fru-1,6-P2. The lines are theoretical based upon when n = 2, and the points were experimentally determined. The inset shows a plot of the slope of the family of curves in Fig. 1versus [AMP]2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)where v, Vm, A, B, I, Ka, Kb, Kia, Ki, Kii, Kiii, and Kiv represent initial velocity, maximal velocity, the concentration of Mg2+, Fru-1,6-P2, AMP, the Michaelis constants for Mg2+ and Fru-1,6-P2, dissociation constants for Mg2+, and the dissociation constants for AMP from the enzyme-AMP, the enzyme-AMP-AMP, the enzyme-Fru-1,6-P2-AMP, and the enzyme-Fru-1,6-P2-AMP-AMP complexes, respectively. n represents the Hill coefficient for AMP with FBPase. When n = 2, the binding of AMP to FBPase exhibits cooperativity; on the other hand, there is no cooperativity when n = 1. In the case of wild-type FBPase and R15A, E19Q, and T27A mutant FBPases, the kinetic data from experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 1 all fit best to when n = 2 (data not shown). Thus, AMP cooperativity was not altered with these mutants. Replacement of Arg-22 with Met, however, yielded the kinetic data shown in Fig. 2, which gave an excellent fit to when n = 1 but did not fit as well to when n = 2. The “Goodness of Fit” was 5% when n = 1 and 12% when n = 2. is consistent with the random mechanism along with the following interactions: Figure 2:Plot of reciprocal of initial velocity in arbitrary fluorescent units versus reciprocal of [Mg2+]2 for R22M FBPase. The concentrations of AMP are 0 (▪), 0.5 μM (+), 1.0 μM (▴), 2.0 μM (□), and 3.0 μM (×). The coupled spectrofluorescence assay was performed at 25°C in 50 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 M KCl, 10 μM Fru-1,6-P2.

As expected, when a double-reciprocal plot of 1/velocity against 1/(Fru-1,6-P2) was made at different concentrations of AMP for wild type, R15A, E19Q, R22K, or T27A, a family of intersecting lines was obtained to the left of the 1/v axis (data not shown). These data were best fit to when n = 2. In the case of R22M, the best fits were obtained when n = 1 in. These results suggest that the positive charge on the side chain of Arg-22 is essential for maintaining AMP cooperativity. Mutation of Thr-27 to Ala, which interacts with O2A of the phosphate group of AMP, caused a significant decrease (1300-fold) in AMP affinity for FBPase without changing the AMP cooperativity. A dramatic change of AMP binding and cooperativity, however, has been reported for the Glu-29 → Gln mutant of FBPase(24.Chen M. Chen L. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5554-5558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glu-29 is also directly ligated to the phosphoryl portion of AMP.Secondary Structure AnalysisTo determine whether the protein structure was changed by the mutations at the interface of the FBPase dimers, CD spectrometry was used to analyze the secondary structure of wild-type and mutant forms of FBPase. The CD spectra of the six enzymes are essentially superimposable (data not shown). These observations indicate that no global structural alterations were caused by the mutations and that the differences observed in the kinetic data between the mutant and wild-type forms of FBPase are not due to global conformational changes caused by the mutations.DISCUSSIONThe major finding of this report is the complete loss of AMP cooperativity and increased enzymatic activity when FBPase Arg-22 is mutated to Met. It has long been recognized that the binding of AMP to wild-type FBPase exhibits cooperativity(10.Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Nimmo H.G. Tipton K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13.Taketa K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5554-5558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic data of AMP inhibition with wild-type, R15A, E19Q, R22K, and T27A FBPases gave excellent fits to a cooperativity model. In these cases, the Hill coefficient for the nucleotide is 2.0. On the other hand, R22M shows a loss of AMP cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 1.0 for AMP. AMP is a competitive inhibitor of Mg2+ and noncompetitive inhibitor of Fru-1,6-P2 at neutral pH with the five mutant forms of FBPase as well as with the wild-type enzyme.Data contained in this report suggest that mutation of porcine FBPase Arg-22 to Met causes the complete loss of cooperativity without changing AMP affinity; however, the affinity for AMP decreased markedly in the case of R22K without altering AMP cooperativity. We conclude that the Arg-22 residue of mammalian FBPase is essential for simultaneous cooperativity and binding of AMP. An understanding of this finding requires further investigations (e.g. solution of the crystal structure of R22M FBPase); however, modeling studies were undertaken to provide some insights into the effect of mutation of Arg-22 to Met and Lys. Fig. 3 is a stereoview of the subunit C1-C4 interface of FBPase in the T-state from the porcine kidney FBPase crystal structure reported by Ke et al.(38.Ke H. Liang J.-Y. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4412-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). AMP molecules and most of helix H1 and H2 are shown. In the T-state of FBPase, NE of Arg-22 of subunit C1 is hydrogen bonded (3.1 Å) to O of Thr-27, a residue located at the AMP binding site of subunit C4. Atoms N and OG1 of Thr-27 are hydrogen bonded to O2A of the phosphoryl group of AMP. To determine the possible conformational changes in the area of the mutation, we used computer modeling to compare energy minimized R22M and R22K mutants with the wild-type enzyme. The 10-Å area around residue 22 of both subunits C1 and C4 was free to change, while the rest of the molecule was fixed. The conformation of residues in the energy minimized area changed slightly, but the changes were principally identical in all three models. This is why in our further analysis we kept all residues fixed to their positions in the x-ray structure except residues 22 and 27 and the nearest water molecules. In the R22M mutant, the side chain of Met-22 retained the conformation of the side chain of Arg (Fig. 4A). Thus, the only obvious change in subunit interactions is the loss of hydrogen bonding from NE of Arg-22 to O of Thr-27. The kinetic data suggest that the hydrogen bond is necessary for cooperativity but not AMP binding affinity. The importance of the interactions between Glu-19, Glu-29, and Arg-22 is not obvious from the x-ray structure. For example, Glu-19 is hydrogen bonded to Arg-22, but the symmetry related pair Glu-19- Arg-22 is not. Moreover, the Glu-19-Arg-22 interaction is within the same subunit and has no direct relation to intersubunit contacts. The interaction of Arg-22 with Glu-29 (and vice versa) may be more important, but these groups do not make a direct contact (Arg-22 NH2 is 4.74 Å from Glu-29 OE1). In the case of the R22K mutant, NZ of Lys is shifted 1.4 Å further from its Cα atom than the NE of Arg. This difference puts NZ of Lys-22 close enough to OG1 of Thr-27 of the symmetry-related subunit so that they form a hydrogen bond (Fig. 4B). Our modeling suggests that the new hydrogen bond perturbs the interaction between OG1 of Thr-27 and the phosphoryl group of AMP (the distance changes from 2.8 Å in the wild-type to 3.2 Å in the mutant enzyme). This finding correlates with kinetic data for the R22K and T27A mutants. In T27A, a complete loss of one hydrogen bond (from OG1 of Thr-27 to O2A of AMP) reduced its affinity for AMP by 1300-fold. The putative weakening of the same hydrogen bond in the R22K mutant also reduces AMP affinity but to a lesser extent. Despite the different positions for NZ of Lys-22 and NE of Arg-22, each side chain maintains an interaction with carbonyl 27. This interaction should be present as well in the T27A mutant. Thus, apparently, subtle changes in the position of OG1 of Thr-27 influences AMP affinity, whereas the loss of hydrogen bond to O of Thr-27 (as in R22M) results in the complete loss of cooperativity.Figure 3:Stereo drawing of the adjacent AMP binding sites of two subunits of wild-type FBPase.

INTRODUCTIONGranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) ( 1The abbreviations used are: CSFcolony-stimulating factorGMgranulocyte-macrophageCSFRcolony-stimulating factor receptorILinterleukinrABrecombinant antibodyTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateCDRcomplementarity determining regionELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered saline.) is a hematopoietic growth factor and a cytokine involved in many inflammatory and immune processes. GM-CSF activates antigen-presenting cells (monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells), increases major histocompatibility complex class II expression-enhancing antigen presentation, and increases macrophage anti-tumor activity(1.Weisbart R. Golde D. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 1989; 3: 401-409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it has been used as an important adjunct in cancer therapy for bone marrow recovery following chemotherapy and transplantation(2.Antman K.H. Eur. J. Cancer. 1993; 3: S2-S6Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Moreover, GM-CSF induces protective immune responses against lymphoma cells if fused with a tumor-derived idiotype, eliciting tumor-specific immunity(3.Tao M.-H. Levy R. Nature. 1993; 362: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). GM-CSF also enhances the immunogenicity of tumor cells when expressed by them, resulting in induction of protective anti-tumor immunity, while other cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, γ-interferon, or tumor necrosis factor-α are less effective(4.Dranoff G.

GM-CSF activity is mediated by binding to specific cellular receptors (GM-CSFR) which belong to a recently described supergene family(17.Chiba S. Tojo A. Kitamura T. Urabe A. Miyazono K. Takaku F.

Blood. 1990; 75: 59-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity GM-CSFR is comprised of an α chain (GM-CSFRα) specific for GM-CSF(20.Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and a β chain (βc), which can also associate with the IL-3 and IL-5 receptor α chains(21.Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K.-I. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The GM-CSFRα imparts specificity to the interaction with GM-CSF, and when expressed without βc is able to bind GM-CSF, albeit with lower affinity than the heterodimeric receptor(24.Shanafelt A.B. Kastelein R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25466-25472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity receptor (GM-CSFRα and βc) appears to be the signal-transducing unit(25.Yokota T. Watanabe S. Mui A.L. Muto A. Miyajima A. Arai K. Leukemia. 1993; 7: S102-S107PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), with a sequential binding of GM-CSF to GM-CSFRα followed by binding to βc postulated.GM-CSF and the related four-helix bundle cytokines are important targets for drug design and production of low molecular weight analogs which mimic the native ligand. Studies of ligand-receptor intermolecular interactions which help delineate their active sites should allow the development of small molecules able to mimic the larger polypeptide ligands. Such small drugs, created based on analysis of the most important binding interactions, could circumvent problems of immunogenicity, antigenicity, rapid proteolysis by serum proteolytic enzymes, short serum half-life, and low oral bioavailability, commonly presented by large polypeptides.In prior studies, linear peptide analogs of GM-CSF were produced by dividing the human GM-CSF sequence into six peptides(27.VonFeldt J.M. Monfardini C. Fish S. Rosenbaum H. Kieber-Emmons T. Williams R.M. Kahn S.A. Weiner D.B. Williams W.V. Peptide Res. 1995; 8: 20-32PubMed Google Scholar). This strategy led to the identification of two peptides with receptor binding and antagonist activity. One peptide corresponding to residues 17-31 (the A helix) inhibited high affinity receptor binding, while a second peptide corresponding to residues 54-78 (the B and C helices) inhibited low affinity receptor binding(27.VonFeldt J.M. Monfardini C. Fish S. Rosenbaum H. Kieber-Emmons T. Williams R.M. Kahn S.A. Weiner D.B. Williams W.V. Peptide Res. 1995; 8: 20-32PubMed Google Scholar). This implicates these sites in intermolecular interactions with the GM-CSFR. We also have used a recombinant antibody (rAb) as a GM-CSF mimic(28.Monfardini C. Kieber-Emmons T. VonFeldt J.M. O'Malley B. Rosenbaum H. Godillot A.P. Kaushansky K. Brown C.B. Voet D. McCallus D.E. Weiner D.B. Williams W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6628-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of the rAb 23.2 allowed the identification of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) as sites of structural mimicry of GM-CSF, focusing attention on the CDRI region mimicking residues on the B and C helices of GM-CSF. After synthesis and characterization of CDRI, CDRII, and CDRII peptides, the CDRI peptide exhibited specific GM-CSF receptor binding and antagonist bioactivity(28.Monfardini C. Kieber-Emmons T. VonFeldt J.M. O'Malley B. Rosenbaum H. Godillot A.P. Kaushansky K. Brown C.B. Voet D. McCallus D.E. Weiner D.B. Williams W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6628-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, these studies suggest that residues on the B and C helices of GM-CSF mediate binding to the low affinity receptor (GM-CSFRα alone).Here we describe the development of two cyclic peptide GM-CSF mimics (1785 and 1786) obtained from structural analysis of the GM-CSF region mimicked by rAb 23.2(28.Monfardini C. Kieber-Emmons T. VonFeldt J.M. O'Malley B. Rosenbaum H. Godillot A.P. Kaushansky K. Brown C.B. Voet D. McCallus D.E. Weiner D.B. Williams W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6628-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cysteines were introduced in the peptide structures at the amino and carboxyl termini to allow cyclization. The cyclized peptides were specifically bound by polyclonal anti-GM-CSF antibody (stronger for 1786 than for 1785). Moreover, 1786 competes with GM-CSF for binding to the GM-CSF receptor present on HL-60 cells and reverses GM-CSF's prevention of apoptosis of MO7E cells. Thus, 1786 represents a structurally designed biological and receptor antagonist of GM-CSF.MATERIALS AND METHODSDesign of Peptides 1785 and 17861785 and 1786 were the result of the comparison of the GM-CSF mimic rAb 23.2 molecular models and its individual CDR sequences with the human GM-CSF structure(28.Monfardini C. Kieber-Emmons T. VonFeldt J.M. O'Malley B. Rosenbaum H. Godillot A.P. Kaushansky K. Brown C.B. Voet D. McCallus D.E. Weiner D.B. Williams W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6628-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Despite the weak primary sequence similarity shown by 23.2 with GM-CSF, structural similarity was suggested centered on the B (residues 54-61) and C (residues 77-83) helices of GM-CSF and the 23.2 CDRI region (28.Monfardini C. Kieber-Emmons T. VonFeldt J.M. O'Malley B. Rosenbaum H. Godillot A.P. Kaushansky K. Brown C.B. Voet D. McCallus D.E. Weiner D.B. Williams W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6628-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Important residues in the GM-CSF structure mimicked by similar residues on 23.2 were postulated to be: Thr-57, Glu-60, Lys-63, Lys-74, Thr-78, Ser-82, and Lys-85. Based on the ability of a predicted reverse turn structure (the 23.2 CDRI) to functionally mimic this site on GM-CSF, two distinct reverse turns were designed using the MacImdad program (Molecular Applications Group, Stanford, CA). Peptide 1786 was designed beginning at Thr-57 and proceeding up the exposed residues on the B helix (Glu-60 and Lys-63), then continuing in the reverse orientation on the C helix (Lys-74, Thr-78, Ser-82, and Lys-85). Glycine or alanine residues were introduced to orient the predicted contact residues on the same face of the reverse turn. Additional Gly residues were added at the amino and carboxyl termini to appropriately position Cys residues for cyclization by disulfide bridge formation. The 1785 peptide was designed according to the same principles, but beginning with Lys-85 on the C helix and proceeding in the opposite orientation. The sequences of these peptides and their predicted structures in comparison with the GM-CSF structure is shown in Fig. 1.Preparation of Cyclic PeptidesThe two peptides were synthesized by solid phase methods, deprotected, and released from the resin by anhydrous HF as described previously (29.Williams W.

The mixture was then layered over 500 μl of chilled fetal calf serum and centrifuged, and the counts/min bound determined in an LKB gamma counter. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific counts/min bound from the total counts/min bound. Scatchard analysis revealed that, at this concentration, predominately low affinity sites (2.9 nM) were measured (27.VonFeldt J.M. Monfardini C. Fish S. Rosenbaum H. Kieber-Emmons T. Williams R.M. Kahn S.A. Weiner D.B. Williams W.V. Peptide Res. 1995; 8: 20-32PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Based on the EC50 achieved by peptide, the Ki was calculated by the method of Cheng and Prusoff(36.Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12178) Google Scholar).Inhibition of ApoptosisThe assay was performed in a 24-well polystyrene plate (Corning, Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA), using MO7E cells (from R. Zollner, Genetics Institute, Cambridge MA), grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, L-glutamine, oxalate, pyruvate, insulin, nonessential amino acids, essential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin, and 20% U87 supernatant (containing GM-CSF as a growth factor). The peptides were added at different dilutions to the wells (final concentrations of 160, 80, 40, and 0 μg/ml). After sterilization of the plates under UV light for 40 min, fixed amounts of sterile GM-CSF (200 pM), TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (Sigma), 4 nM), and U87 supernatant (5%) were added separately to all the different concentrations of peptide. 250 μl of cell suspension at 106 cells/ml, previously washed with the medium without U87 supernatant and resuspended in the same medium, were added to each well, reaching a final concentration 5 × 105 cells/ml in a total volume of 500 μl. After 24 h of growth, cells were lysed and DNA degradation detected both by an agarose gel run and by the use of “Cell Death Detection ELISA” kit (Boehringer Mannheim).For the agarose evaluation, 350 μl of 5 × 105 cells/ml were washed, added to 20 μl of lysis buffer (10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt (Sarkosyl), 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated for 1 h at 50°C. After addition of 10 μl of 0.45 mg/ml RNase and incubation at 50°C for 1 h, the samples were mixed with 10 μl of 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 1% Nue Sieve GTG agarose (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME), heated at 70°C for 10 min, loaded into a 1.2% agarose gel and run for 1 h at 100 V using TBE buffer (89 mM Tris base, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0). The gel was stained with ethidium bromide (Sigma) and photographed under ultraviolet light.Mono- and oligonucleosome fragments present in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates were detected following the protocol for “Cell Death Detection ELISA” kit. Briefly, the microtiter plate was coated with anti-histone solution and, after incubation with a 1:10 dilution of the lysate derived from 2.5 × 104 cells, DNA was detected by the anti-DNA-peroxidase system according to the kit instructions, with color development read at 405 nm.RESULTSPeptide DesignThe two peptides were synthesized according to the sequences reported in Fig. 1. The postulated contact residues on the GM-CSF B and C helices (regions involved in the interaction with GM-CSFRα) were introduced into the peptides in two different orientations (“up” the B and “down” the C helices for 1786, with the opposite orientation for 1785). The design incorporated reverse turn structures together with appropriate spacer residues and cysteines at the amino and carboxyl termini, which allowed the development of cyclic forms.Peptide CyclizationThe procedure followed for peptide cyclization was oxidation of the terminal sulfhydryls with intrachain disulfide bond formation. Ellman determination indicated that only 4.7 and 1.8% of free sulfhydryls were still present in the oxidized forms of 1785 and 1786, respectively, confirming near complete oxidation of the peptides.Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on the oxidized peptides to confirm that oxidation had resulted in intrachain disulfide bond formation, as opposed to formation of oligomers. The mass spectrometry study showed that >90% of the oxidized 1785 peptide was represented by a peak at molecular mass 1514, with the theoretical molecular mass for 1785 being 1511 daltons. Similarly, >90% of the 1786 peptide was seen as a peak at molecular mass 1637, the theoretical molecular mass being 1639. Thus, both of the oxidized peptides were >90% in the monomeric form, with only trace contamination by oligomers (dimers and trimers).Recognition of Peptides by Polyclonal Antibody against GM-CSFThe ability of these peptides to mimic GM-CSF was initially evaluated by its recognition by polyclonal antibody against GM-CSF in an ELISA (Fig. 2). Neither peptide showed any specific binding by the preimmune serum (normal mouse serum), indicating lack of nonspecific binding. Both peptides 1785 and 1786 were specifically bound by polyclonal antibody against GM-CSF, with the titer higher for 1786 than that for 1785. The control peptide was not bound by the anti-GM-CSF, further supporting specific recognition of the peptide mimics. This supports structural mimicry of GM-CSF by the peptides 1785 and 1786.Figure 2:Binding of polyclonal Ab against GM-CSF to 1786 and 1785 peptides. Binding was performed by ELISA assay as described under “Material and Methods.” The graphs shown are referred to the case of peptides at 1.5 μg/well. Similar results were obtained with 3, 4.5, and 6 μg/well. Binding of 1786, 1785, and control peptides both to anti-GM-CSF polyclonal antibody and to preimmunization serum (normal mouse serum, NMS) are reported. The values are obtained subtracting the A450 of wells without peptides from the A450 of wells with peptides at different concentrations. The mean ± S.D. of duplicate wells is shown for decreasing amounts of polyclonal anti-GM-CSF antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Peptide Binding to the GM-CSF ReceptorThe ability of the peptides to bind the GM-CSF receptor was evaluated by their ability to compete with GM-CSF for binding to the GM-CSF receptor present on HL-60 cells as evaluated by a radioreceptor assay. Peptides were preincubated with HL-60 cells prior to the addition of 125I-GM-CSF, and specific binding was determined by carrying out identical reactions in the presence of excess of unlabeled GM-CSF. Fig. 3 reports the typical results obtained with 1786, 1785, and control peptides. While 1785 and control peptides failed to show any specific inhibitory activity, 1786 inhibited GM-CSF binding to its receptor in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% inhibition achieved at ~500 μg/ml. 1786 therefore antagonizes GM-CSF binding to its receptor, indicating binding of this peptide to the GM-CSFR on HL-60 cells. Scatchard analysis of GM-CSF binding to HL-60 cells reveals high affinity (46 pM) and low affinity (2.9 nM) sites for GM-CSF binding(20.Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 35.Kaushansky K. Shoemaker S. Alfaro S. Brown C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of the assays here, predominately low affinity sites were measured (27.VonFeldt J.M. Monfardini C. Fish S. Rosenbaum H. Kieber-Emmons T. Williams R.M. Kahn S.A. Weiner D.B. Williams W.V. Peptide Res. 1995; 8: 20-32PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Based on the low affinity Kd, calculation of the Ki for peptide using the method of Cheng and Prusoff (36.Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12178) Google Scholar) gives a value of 270 μM.Figure 3:Inhibition of 125I-GM-CSF binding to HL-60 cells by peptides. The radioreceptor assay was performed as reported under “Materials and Methods,” using 106 cells/test. The specific proportion of count/min bound was determined subtracting the proportion of counts/min bound under identical conditions in the presence of saturating amounts of unlabeled GM-CSF (50 nM). The percent inhibition of binding of 1786, 1785, and control peptide is reported versus increasing amounts of peptides together with the S.D. of duplicate tests.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Bioactivity of PeptidesGM-CSF bioactivity can be evaluated by its ability to inhibit spontaneous apoptosis of the GM-CSF-dependent cell line MO7E(37.Rajotte D.

Hematol. 1995; 23: 168-173PubMed Google Scholar). This assay is of particular utility as it can also be applied to stimuli which inhibit apoptosis independent of signaling through the GM-CSF receptor(37.Rajotte D. Haddad P. Haman A. Cragoe Jr., E.J.

To analyze the bioactivity shown by the 1786 and 1785 peptides, their capacity to interfere with GM-CSF's ability to prevent apoptosis in MO7E cells was assayed. Apoptosis was evaluated both by agarose gel electrophoresis of total cellular DNA and by a specific ELISA assay. In addition to GM-CSF, two other stimuli were evaluated: phorbol ester (TPA), which inhibits apoptosis in a receptor-independent fashion, and GM-CSF containing U87 cell supernatant.Both the agarose gel and the ELISA results (Fig. 4) indicated clear antagonist activity for the 1786 peptide, with reversal of GM-CSF's prevention of apoptos"

INTRODUCTIONG-protein-coupled receptor responses to agonist ligands are modulated at multiple levels along the signal transduction pathway. Regulation includes short term effects on receptor coupling and on internalization of the receptor. Longer term effects include down-regulation of the cellular receptor content and mRNA levels (Tholanikunnel et al., 1995). Several different protein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate some of the seven transmembrane helix receptors on cytosolic portions of the molecule, reducing coupling of the receptors to their associated heterotrimeric G-proteins (reviewed by Kobilka(1992)). One family of protein kinases, the G-protein receptor kinases (GRKs), ( 1The abbreviations used are: GRKG-protein receptor kinaseβARKβ-adrenergic receptor kinasePHpleckstrin homologyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferaseTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1,bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineROSrod outer segmentsHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography.) has been defined, (Premont et al., 1995; Inglese et al., 1993). Three GRKs have been shown to target agonist-occupied receptors, phosphorylating multiple serine/threonine residues adjacent to acidic amino acid residues in the primary amino acid sequence. There are presently six members of this protein kinase family that share a common catalytic domain, diverging in the N- and C-terminal extensions outside of this region.The GRK2/GRK23 (βARK1 and βARK2) subfamilies are encoded by separate genes (Benovic et al., 1991). They were originally shown to phosphorylate the β2-adrenergic receptor and thus were given the name β-adrenergic receptor kinases or βARKs. The βARKs are C-terminally extended relative to other members of the GRK family. The C-terminal 222 amino acids of βARK1 and βARK2 contain a domain responsible for the association of the enzyme with heterotrimeric G-protein Gβγ subunits (Pitcher et al., 1992). Addition of Gβγ subunits to an in vitro phosphorylation system stimulates βARK phosphorylation of receptor substrates (Haga and Haga, 1990, 1992), but not that of peptide substrates (Pitcher et al. 1992). This C-terminal domain of the kinase includes a region homologous to a domain of the platelet protein pleckstrin (PH domain) (Touhara et al., 1993), thought to mediate protein-protein interactions among signaling proteins (Musacchio et al., 1993; Gibson et al., 1994; Ingley and Hemmings, 1994). PH domains may be functionally analogous to the Src homology 2 and 3 domains of tyrosine kinase signaling systems (5er et al., 1993). While the portions of the βARK C terminus involved in the association with Gβγ subunits have been delineated (Koch et al., 1993), less is known about the determinants on the Gβγ partner. The multiple subtypes of Gβ and Gγ, the requirement for the Gβγ heterodimer for cellular function, (Iniguez-Lluhi et al., 1992), and multiple post-translational modifications (Yamane and Fung, 1993) have impeded study. This paper describes the dissociation of Gβγ binding to hβARK1 from Gβγ stimulation of rhodopsin phosphorylation by this kinase after proteolysis with Lys-C. Gγ is cleaved by the protease at lysine 33 in Gγ2 (lysine 36 in Gγ3), and the Gγ fragments remain associated with the Gβ subunit.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFrozen bovine retinas were from George A. Hormel, Austin, MN. Frozen bovine brain was from Pel-Freez, Rogers, AR. ATP, GDP, GTPγS, NAD+, sodium cholate, Lubrol PX, isobutylmethylxanthine, L-propanolol, phosphoenolpyruvate, dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, forskolin, and pyruvate kinase were from Sigma. Endoproteinase Lys-C from Lysobacter enzymogenes (catalog no. 476986) was from Boehringer Mannheim. Reagents for SDS-PAGE were from Research Organics. Nitrocellulose (BA83) was obtained from Schleicher and Schuell. DE-52 was from Whatman. Antibodies specific for β1, β2, β3, β2, pan-β, γ2, γ3, γ4, and γ5 of the heterotrimeric G-protein Gβγ and neutralizing peptides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. These antibodies are also useful for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay determinations. Antibodies to the C-terminal 222 amino acids of human βARK1 were raised against the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA) and purified from an IgG fraction following adsorption against immobilized GST by affinity chromatography on immobilized GST-C-terminal 222-amino acid human βARK1, eluting with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2. Secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit peroxidase) and ECL detection reagents were purchased from Amersham. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [γ-35S]GTP (1045 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]NAD+ (30 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. S-Adenosyl-L-[3H-methyl]methionine (77 Ci/mmol), the 125I-cAMP Scintillation Proximity Assay Kit, Rainbow prestained molecular weight markers, and Amplify were acquired from Amersham. Purified recombinant human βARK His6 (PH+C) (Gly556-Ser670) protein was generously provided by Dr. Daruka Mahadevan (Mahadevan et al., 1995). DNA encoding the βARK C-terminal domains βARK (PH+C) (Gly556-Ser670) and the C-terminal 222 amino acids (Pro466-Leu689) were cloned by PCR from the human βARK1 cDNA provided by Dr. A. DeBlasi (Chuang et al., 1992), and their nucleotide sequences confirmed on an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated sequencer. The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) using the pGEX-2T vector system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and purified according to standard protocols. Peptides corresponding to residues 8-34 of Gγ2 or residues 3-29 of Gβ2 were kindly provided by Dr. R. Neubig, Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan.Heterotrimeric G-proteins were isolated from frozen bovine brain, and the Gβγ subunit complex (mixed subtypes of β and γ subunits) purified by chromatography in sodium cholate on heptylamine-Sepharose (Sternweis and Pang, 1990) in the presence of GDP/AlMgF. Further resolution of the separated Gβγ from Gα subunits for ADP-ribosylation studies was achieved by ion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ (Pharmacia) column in 0.1% (w/v) Lubrol PX (Sternweis and Pang, 1990). The purified Gα and Gβγ subunits were stored in aliquots at −80°C. Two different batches of Gβγ when assayed for effects of Lys-C proteolysis on rhodopsin phosphorylation and hβARK1 binding activity revealed no discernible differences. Carboxymethylation of the C terminus of the γ subunit of Gβγ with S-adenosyl-L-[3H-methyl]methionine was accomplished using a cholate-extracted brain membrane fraction (Fung et al., 1990). Bovine retinal rod outer segments (ROS) containing rhodopsin were purified under red light illumination and urea-extracted before use as a phosphorylation substrate (Phillips et al., 1989). SDS-PAGE was performed in 10% acrylamide, 0.267% bisacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS in the Laemmli buffer system (Laemmli, 1970). Rhodopsin phosphorylation was determined after separation of 32P-labeled proteins by SDS-PAGE. Radioactive gels were fixed for 10 min in 25% methanol, 10% acetic acid, washed with distilled water for 10 min, and the gels dried at 80°C under vacuum before exposure to Kodak XAR-5 or X-Omat-LS film. The 32P radioactivity of the rhodopsin band was quantitated from the film using a BioImage (Millipore) scanner. Tritiated proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were visualized after fixation in 25% methanol, 10% acetic acid, soaking in an Amplify enhancement solution for 45 min, and drying and exposing to film at −80°C for 3-7 days. βARK1 and Gβ were determined after transfer of polypeptides separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide, 0.367% bisacrylamide in the Laemmli buffer system (Laemmli, 1970) to 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose (LeVine and Sahyoun, 1988). An affinity-purified antibody directed against the C-terminal 222 amino acids of hβARK1 recognizing the PH domain of that kinase (Sallese et al., 1995) was used to detect the enzyme. Gβ subunits were detected with pan-β subunit-specific antibodies. β and γ subunits of the heterotrimeric G-proteins were separated on 16.5% acrylamide, 0.5% bisacrylamide gels containing 6 M urea and 0.1% SDS in a Tris-Tricine buffer system (Schagger and von Jagow, 1987). The subunits were transferred as described for βARK1 and were detected with Gβ- or Gγ- subtype subunit-specific antibodies. Quantitation of the ECL was standardized as described (Mahadevan et al., 1995).Measurement of the Ability of Gβγ to Stimulate Rhodopsin or Synthetic Peptide Phosphorylation by hβARK1Gβγ subunits (20-1400 nM) were incubated in a 60-μl reaction volume containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 6 mM MgCl2, 16 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μM ATP, 10 μM GTPγS, and 160 pmol of rhodopsin as urea-extracted ROS. After 10 min on ice, 5 μl of 50 μg/ml recombinant hβARK1 purified from Sf9 cells were added, and the reaction was illuminated with a fluorescent table lamp at 30°C for 20 min. The rate of phosphorylation was linear for at least 30 min under these conditions. The reaction was terminated with SDS-sample buffer without boiling, and the proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of the synthetic peptide RRREEEEESAAA (Immunodynamics, Inc., La Jolla, CA) was carried out in the same reaction buffer with 100 μM peptide in place of ROS. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 volume of 30% trichloroacetic acid. Phosphorylated products were spotted onto Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper and washed with 75 mM phosphoric acid three times for 15 min each to remove the free nucleotide. Phosphorylated peptide was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the paper (Cook et al., 1982). Translocation of hβARK1 was performed according to Chuang et al.(1992) and involved a 3-min incubation of 300 pmol of rhodopsin (as urea-treated ROS), 5 μl of 50 μg/ml hβARK1, and absence or presence of 178 nM Gβγ under a fluorescent table lamp at room temperature in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol. The ROS were pelleted at 4°C at 109,000 × g for 10 min in a TLA 100.3 rotor with microcentrifuge tube adapters. The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and assayed as above for rhodopsin phosphorylation.Gβγ Subunit-mediated ADP-ribosylation of Gαo and Gαi by Pertussis ToxinThe ability of Gβγ subunits to support pertussis toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribose transfer from [α-32P]NAD+ to Gαo/Gαi was determined essentially as described by (Kwon et al., 1993), with 5 μM NAD+ (2 μCi/assay), 0.5 mM dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, and 7.5 μg/ml activated pertussis toxin in a final volume of 50 μl of 75 mM Hepes buffer, pH 8.0, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 μM GDP. The dose response for Gβγ subunits was determined at a constant Gαo/Gαi concentration. After SDS-PAGE, the incorporation of 32P into polypeptides migrating in the Gα region was determined by densitometry from autoradiograms.Adenylate Cyclase Inhibition by Gβγ SubunitsDose-dependent inhibition of platelet membrane type I adenylate cyclase by Gβγ subunits was determined as described by Kwon et al.(1993), except that cAMP was determined by Scintillation Proximity immunoassay (Amersham) according to the manufacturer. Dilutions of Gβγ subunits were made in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% (v/v) Lubrol PX. Reactions were run in a 100-μl final volume containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 10 μM propanolol, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.01 mM GTP, 0.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 μM forskolin, and 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase. Ten microliters of diluted Gβγ subunits were preincubated on ice in the reaction mixture with 5 μl (15 μg) of platelet membrane protein for 5 min. The tubes were transferred to a 30°C water bath and the incubation continued for 15 min. One hundred microliters of ice-cold 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid were added to stop the reaction on ice. Cyclic AMP content was determined on aliquots of the supernatant after centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature to remove precipitated material. Adenylate cyclase activity was linear in both membrane protein and time over the ranges used.Proteolysis of Gβγ by Endoproteinase Lys-CCleavage of the Gβγ complex by Lys-C protease was performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.8% cholate, 0.05% Lubrol PX for 30 min at 30°C using a protease:protein ratio of 1:10 (w/w). The digestion was terminated by the addition of 20 μg/ml leupeptin. To facilitate comparison of protease treatment, the different functional assays were carried out with the same batches of Gβγ stored at −70°C that had been kept on ice, incubated without protease at 30°C, incubated with leupeptin-inactivated protease at 30°C, or incubated with active Lys-C at 30°C for 30 min. Thirty minutes of incubation of Gβγ at 30°C without protease had no discernible effect on its measured biochemical properties.Binding of Gβγ Subunits to PH Domain-containing C-terminal βARK1 FragmentsGβγ subunit binding to immobilized PH domains was determined by immunoblot analysis with pan-anti-β subunit antibodies as described by Mahadevan et al.(1995).Amino Acid Sequencing of Lys-C-cleaved GβγSeparation of the Gβ and Gγ subunits was achieved by C4 reverse phase chromatography under the conditions used to separate the farnesylated γ subunit of transducin on a C18 column (Parish and Rando, 1994). Western blot analysis showed that the Gβ and Gγ subunits were separated under these conditions (data not shown). Fifty μg of Lys-C-treated Gβγ (~1.2 nmol) was diluted with an equal volume of 6 M guanidine HCl, 50 mM dithiothreitol and injected onto a Brownlee 4.6 × 30-mm 300-Å pore size C4 reverse phase column equilibrated with 5% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at 0.75 ml/min. After a 10-min wash period, the proportion of acetonitrile was linearly increased to 65% over 40 min and held at 65% for 5 min. The effluent was monitored during the separation at 214 nm, and 0.75-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing the γ subunits as judged by comigration of digested [3H]carboxymethylated Gβγ (on a separate HPLC run) and the appearance of new 214 nm absorbing peaks were reduced to near dryness under vacuum on a Savant SpeedVac. The fractions were subjected to 15 cycles of automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer and the phenylthiohydantoinamino acids identified with the integral HPLC unit of the sequencer.RESULTSThe Gβγ subunits of the heterotrimeric G-proteins form a heterodimer (β = 35 kDa or 36 kDa, γ= 6748-8321 kDa), depending on the subunit subtypes and post-translational modifications. This non-covalent complex is not dissociable under non-denaturing conditions and associates reversibly with an undetermined variety of Gα subtypes and with a protein kinase A substrate, phosducin (Bauer et al., 1992), as well as a host of effector molecules such as adenylate cyclase, ion channels, and phospholipases (Clapham and Neer, 1993). The Gγs are multiply post-translationally modified by N termini N-acetylation (Wilcox et al., 1994) and C-terminal cysteine geranylgeranylation and carboxymethylation (reviewed by Yamane and Fung(1993)). Although these modifications are not required for assembly of the Gβγ dimer, prenylation apparently modulates interactions with other proteins (Kisselev et al., 1994) and their interaction with the lipid bilayer (Muntz et al., 1992; Iniguez-Lluhi et al., 1992). Gβγ requires small amounts of detergent to remain in solution.Lys-C Proteolysis of GβγThe structure of the Gβγ dimer is compact, judging from its hydrodynamic properties (Huff and Neer, 1986) and by the resistance of the native protein to proteases such as trypsin (Fung and Nash, 1983; Tamir et al., 1991; Winslow et al., 1986). Proteolysis by the endoproteinase Lys-C from L. enzymogenes was carried out in sodium cholate, a detergent with a low aggregation number (small number of detergent molecules per micelle) (Calbiochem, 1993) to minimize interference with the hydrophobic C terminus of Gβγ.Reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteolytic product as a function of protease:Gβγ ratio revealed a size range for the Gγ fragment of Mr 3400-5200 by silver staining, a reduction from Mr 6900-8600, corresponding to an Mr of 3500. There was no discernible effect on the Mr of the Gβ subunit (Fig. 1). The mixed Gβγ preparation isolated from frozen bovine brain contains multiple subtypes of Gβ and Gγ subunits, the latter accounting for the smear around Mr 6500. Antibodies raised to synthetic peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 17 residues of the Gγ subunits or 21 amino acids of the Gβ subunits (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) are subtype-selective and can be used to determine the distribution of the subtypes in the preparation. Western immunoblotting of two separate purifications revealed that the purified bovine brain Gβγ used in these studies has the following distribution of Gβ and Gγ subunits: β4≫β2 > β1 > β3; γ2≫γ3≫γ2 > 5 (data not shown). This quantitation assumes that the subtype-selective antibodies are equally capable of detecting antigen at 1.6 μg/ml antibody. In addition, the purification of the Gβγ subunits could influence the recovery and thus the apparent distribution of the different subtypes.Methylation of the C-terminal cysteine (Cys68) carboxyl moiety of the purified brain Gβγ with S-adenosyl-L-[3H-methyl]methionine (Fung et al., 1990) provided a marker for the C terminus of the Gγ subunit. Lys-C treatment of the tritiated Gβγ released a labeled fragment of Mr 3500 (Fig. 2), mirroring the shift on SDS-PAGE to lower Mr seen with silver staining (Fig. 1). This implies that the extreme C terminus of the Gγ subunit remains intact. Immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE showed that N-terminal Gγ subunit immunoreactivity (residues 2-17) was eliminated by Lys-C treatment (Fig. 3). By contrast, for the Gβ subunit, neither the N-terminal immunoreactivity (data not shown) nor the size on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) was affected by Lys-C treatment. Gel permeation chromatography of the [3H]carboxymethylated Gβγ on a Superose 12 column in 0.8% cholate before or after Lys-C treatment demonstrated that the fragments of the cleaved Gγ subunit remained complexed with the Gβ subunit (Table 1). When the Superose 12 column fractions were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and slot blotting onto nitrocellulose, virtually no loss of the immunoreactive N-terminal fragment(s) of Gβγ was observed. By contrast, denaturing SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis of the same fractions revealed a significant loss of N-terminal Gγ subunit immunoreactivity (Table 1).Figure 2:Reduction in Mr of C-terminal [3H]carboxymethylated bovine brain Gβγ by Lys-C proteolysis visualized by 3H autoradiography. 100 μg of bovine brain Gβγ were carboxymethylated with 0.5 mg of cholate-extracted bovine brain membrane protein and 50 μCi of S-adenosyl-L-[3H-methyl]methionine (77 Ci/mmol) in 0.5 ml of carboxymethylation buffer and the labeled proteins re-extracted with cholate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, [3H]carboxymethylated proteins incubated for 30 min at 30°C in the absence of protease; lane 2, + 2 μg of endoprotease Lys-C. The Mr 24,000 labeled protein is an endogenous substrate for the carboxymethyltransferase derived from the brain membrane enzyme source. This contaminant represents a minor fraction of the 3H label incorporated. Lys-C treatment leads to a Mr~3500 decrease in size of the labeled Gγ subunit. The leading ion front ran to the very bottom of the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Removal of N-terminal Gγ subunit immunoreactivity by Lys-C proteolysis.

The arrow marks the position of the truncated C-terminal Gγ sequences (Ala33-Cys67 for Gγ2; Ala37-Cys67 for Gγ3). The two Gγ subtypes nearly comigrated on reverse phase chromatography so their sequences were determined simultaneously. This was possible because both sequences are known, they were present in different amounts, and they differ at several positions. The asterisk shows the position of the undigested Gγ2 and Gγ3 polypeptides, while the cluster of radioactive peaks around fraction 40 represent undissociated Gβγ and the unidentified carboxymethylated Mr 24,000 protein in brain membranes (see Fig. 1 and Fung et al.(1990)). Table 2 shows the sequences obtained from the major peaks of 214 nm absorbance produced by Lys-C treatment of unlabeled isolated Gβγ subunits. Gγ2, the major immunoreactive Gγ subtype in the purified brain Gβγ preparation, was likewise the prominent proteolytic fragment represented. Both Gγ2 and Gγ3 yielded peptides beginning with Ala33 (numbering system of Gγ2, A36 of Gγ3) immediately following Lys32, consistent with the cleavage specificity of Lys-C after lysine. The [3H]carboxymethylation experiments indicate that this C-terminal peptide extends to the modified penultimate cysteine. The removal of 32(35) amino acid residues is consistent with the Mr change in Gγ seen by SDS-PAGE (~3500, Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Gγ sequences corresponding to other potential Lys-C proteolytic fragments of Gγ2, Gγ3, or other known Gγ subtypes were not detected. Minor 214 nm absorbance peaks contained short C-terminal Gγ fragments that were unrelated to Lys-C cleavage specificity and probably represent co-purified proteolytic fragments in the initial brain preparation. Small amounts of sequences corresponding to N-terminal methionine-containing and non-acetylated Gγ2 and Gγ3 were also detected. The same sequencing results were obtained for two independent preparations of Gβγ subunits.Figure 4:C4 reverse phase chromatography of [3H]carboxymethylated Gβγ subunits. Fifteen μg of [3H]carboxymethylated Gβγ were treated with either buffer or 1 μg of Lys-C in a final volume of 100 μl for 1.5 h at 30°C.

Their ability to bind to ROS and to modulate rhodopsin phosphorylation by full-length recombinant hβARK1 was measured. Their ability to bind to the GST-βARK C-terminal domain of 222 amino acids (Pro466-Leu689) and to bind to a more restricted region of the kinase, GST- or His6-tagged βARK PH+C domain (βARK G556-S670), was determined. Finally, the ability of the treated and control Gβγ subunits to associate with and to modulate Gα subunit activities and to regulate the activity of an effector, Type I adenylate cyclase, were also assessed.Modulation of βARK1-mediated Receptor PhosphorylationThe Lys-C-treated Gβγ subunit preparation supported substantial translocation of human βARK1 to isolated retinal rod outer segments (Fig. 5A), but failed to stimulate phosphorylation of rhodopsin (Fig. 5B). Gβγ subunits treated with leupeptin-inhibited Lys-C fully supported both translocation and phosphorylation. Fig. 5C shows that Lys-C proteolysis of Gγ2 and Gγ3 abrogates stimulation of βARK1 phosphorylation of receptor substrates without abolishing binding of the kinase. The"

This work revises and extends our previous treatment (Thompson, B. J., Camien, M. N., and Warner, R. C. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 73, 2299-2303). New methodology and new highly purified substrates have been used. The latter include figure 8s prepared from phage G4 DNA by annealing single-stranded components and two sizes of a novel cruciform. We treat the process as a one-dimensional diffusion based on the random walk, the mathematical basis of which is discussed in detail. The step rate is shown to be 3 orders of magnitude slower than we reported previously. The most important contribution to the erroneously high rate was a result of the presence of EDTA in the spreading solution used for electron microscopy at that time. A second contribution of about 4-fold resulted from catalysis by EcoRI and other proteins. The rates reported here are for the uncatalyzed reaction.

INTRODUCTIONThe exchange of strands between two duplex DNAs by branch migration through the Holliday junction is essential to genetic recombination, and its physical parameters are of fundamental importance. The determinations reported here of the rate of uncatalyzed branch migration required the development of highly purified substrates and the removal of EDTA and of protein catalysts. The figure 8 substrates that we have used in this work were prepared by annealing purified single-stranded precursors derived from phage G4-RF. 1The abbreviations used are: RFreplicative form DNA of the single-stranded DNA phagesbpbase pair(s)MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidform Icovalently closed, circular, duplex DNAform IInicked form I DNAform IIIlinear, double-stranded DNAforms III, and III are referred to, for example, as monomer III or dimer III. We also report the development and use of a novel type of cruciform substrate. The unexpected finding using these substrates and using [3H]trioxsalen labeling for the rate measurements was that the step rate of branch migration was slower by 3 orders of magnitude than our previously reported (1.Thompson B.J. Camien M.N. Warner R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2299-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) measurements indicated. We present here measurements using the new substrates with support for the conclusion that these rates characterize uncatalyzed branch migration. The earlier observations were made on X-forms derived by EcoRI cleavage of the figure 8 molecules that occur naturally in the RF DNA of the single-stranded phage G4(2.Thompson B.J. Escarmis C. Parker B. Slater W.C. Doniger J. Tessman I. Warner R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the distinction between the X-forms and the terminal product of branch migration, linear form III DNA, was made by electron microscopy on a dimer-enriched fraction of RF containing about 2% figure 8s. We now find that these high rates were due primarily to the presence of EDTA in the spreading solutions used at that time for the preparation of samples for examination by electron microscopy and secondarily to the catalysis of branch migration by EcoRI and other proteins. The slow rates of branch migration that have also been reported by several investigators (3.Courey A.J. Wang J.C.

The mathematical bases for the use of random walk theory and for the calculation of step rate constants are given under “Appendix.”EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA and Enzymatic MethodsEscherichia coli C and coliphage G4 were the same strains used in previous work(1.Thompson B.J.

Virology. 1986; 148: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The product is greater than 90% supercoiled and can be used for the preparation of figure 8s or cruciforms. Removal of the residual form II DNA is most easily accomplished by reversible alkaline denaturation based on conditions modified from our previous work(11.Rush M.G. Warner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2704-2708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic reactions were carried out under standard conditions; deviations are noted in the text. Purification of DNA intermediates and substrates routinely included extraction with phenol and chloroform, dialysis against EDTA, and precipitation with ethyl alcohol.Determination of RunoffWe define runoff, RO, as the fractional conversion of a branch-migrating species to product DNA (see “Appendix”). It was determined experimentally by stopping the migration and stabilizing the configuration of the DNA by cross-linking with [3H]trioxsalen as reported previously(13.Warner R.C. Fishel R.A. Wheeler F.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1979; 43: 957-968Crossref Google Scholar). This permitted separation of the migrating species and its product by gel electrophoresis and quantitation of their relative amounts by scintillation counting. The initial steps in the tritiation of trioxsalen (obtained from Paul Elder Co.) were performed for us by ICN Pharmaceuticals or Amersham by the method of Isaacs et al.(14.Isaacs S.T. Shen C.J. Hearst J.E. Rapoport H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and furnished to us as several 100 mCi batches of crude solid product. Radioactive impurities were removed by dissolving it in CHCl3 and extracting 6 times with 2 mM EDTA. The solution was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in methyl alcohol, and filtered. The concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient at 250 nm given by Isaacs et al.(14.Isaacs S.T. Shen C.J. Hearst J.E. Rapoport H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The specific activity was usually greater than 2 × 109 cpm/mg. On storage, water-soluble degradation products accumulate, and the extraction procedure must be repeated.Double-stranded DNA was cross-linked and labeled by a modification of the procedure of Isaacs et al.(14.Isaacs S.T. Shen C.J. Hearst J.E. Rapoport H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Samples containing 0.2 μg of DNA in 40 μl of buffer were placed in a microtiter plate packed in ice. [3H]Trioxsalen, about 106 to 107 cpm in 5 μl of methyl alcohol, was added, and the samples were allowed to stand in the dark for 30 min to equilibrate the intercalation reaction. They were then irradiated in the light box described below for 30 min. The salt concentration was increased to about 0.2 M by adding 4 M NaCl to improve the extractability of trioxsalen and photoproducts. The solution was extracted 5 times with about 0.6 ml of chloroform and twice with ether using solvents equilibrated with 2 mM EDTA.The light box was similar to that described by Isaacs et al.(14.Isaacs S.T. Shen C.J. Hearst J.E. Rapoport H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) in that it employed 2-400-watt GE Hg vapor lamps (H 400 DX 33-1). They were mounted in an air-cooled chamber above and at an angle to the microtiter plate packed in ice so that the end of each was 8 cm from the samples. A 7-mm thickness of glass was used to filter out the UV radiation below 340 nm so that the principal effective radiation was with wavelengths near 360 nm.The labeled DNA species were separated by vertical-tube gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 1 μg/ml EtBr. The gels were sliced with a parallel-wire gel slicer into 1-mm segments which were counted by scintillation. The output of the counter was taken by a computer which produced a graph of the results as illustrated in Fig. 1. RO was calculated after correcting the counts under the peaks that refer to the branch-migrating species and to the product. For this purpose, two controls were run with each series of timed migration samples. An “RO control” run for several half-times, usually at 55°C, was used to correct for background and nonmigrating DNA. The slowest peak in Fig. 1 is an example of the latter. A zero time control was used to establish the initial state with respect to migration. The step rate was derived from the RO as described under “Appendix.”The precision of the method for determining the relative amounts of electrophoretically well-separated DNA species was tested using an XhoI restriction of G4 RF. The larger of the two resulting fragments is 3372 bp in size or 60.5% of the total. In 11 determinations at different times, in each of which the total counts in both peaks were greater than 50,000 cpm, the mean value for this measure was 60.3 ± 0.6%. Thus, the procedures of labeling, electrophoresis, and background correction do not introduce any significant error into the determination of RO. Error greater than that indicated by this test arises from problems of allocation of counts to overlapping peaks in the electrophoretic pattern. This is a problem in the analysis for all substrates in part because the branch migrating peak is skewed in the direction of migration and may overlap the product peak as illustrated in Fig. 1.Protein constituents that were present during the preparation of the branch migration reaction mixture were digested with proteinase K at a concentration of about 0.5 μg/ml at 0°C. The digestion products and the proteinase K were removed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-1.5m (from Bio-Rad) or by dialysis using Spectra/Por 6 membrane (50,000 molecular weight cutoff). These treatments completely removed EcoRI when it was used to convert figure 8s to X-forms and other proteins used before the cross-linking reaction.ElectrophoresisThe methods used for electrophoresis were those previously described(15.Wheeler F.C. Fishel R.A. Warner R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 260-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Gels of 1% agarose were run routinely at 6°C in the submarine mode as 17 × 22 cm slabs, 0.5 cm thick for analytical gels and 1 cm thick for preparative gels. Smaller analytical gels were run in the Hoefer Minnie unit. The preparative gels had a single slot across the width of the gel for loading up to 3.8 ml of solution containing up to 400 μg of DNA. If resolution of plus and minus single strands was required, the gels were run at 6°C in the absence of EtBr and were stained after running. DNA was recovered from bands of the preparative gels by the KI-hydroxylapatite method (16.Smith H.O. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) or by electrophoresis into DEAE-paper(17.Dretzen G. Bellard M. Sassone-Corsi P. Chambon P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar).Other MethodsElectron microscopy was carried out as described previously(2.Thompson B.J. Escarmis C. Parker B. Slater W.C.

Virology. 1986; 148: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). MgCl2 solutions used for enzymatic reactions were standardized by titration with EDTA as described by Schwarzenbach and Flaschka(18.Schwarzenbach G. Flaschka H. Complexometric Titrations. 2nd Ed. Menthuen and Co. Ltd., London1969: 160Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain RY was obtained from Dr. H. Boyer. EcoRI was prepared by the method of Modrich and Zabel(19.Modrich P. Zabel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5866-5874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim.SYNTHESIS OF DNA SUBSTRATESFigure 8 SubstratesAfter our initial observations on the rate of branch migration of native figure 8s(1.Thompson B.J. Camien M.N. Warner R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2299-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we investigated annealing as a more available source of this substrate for rate determinations. Such a construction was shown to be feasible by Clayton et al.(20.Clayton D.A. Davis R.W. Vinograd J. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) who denatured and reannealed a mixture of nicked, circular monomers and dimers of mtDNA and showed the formation of figure 8s. The purified dimer required for our synthesis was prepared by first restricting supercoiled RF to the limit with EcoRI at 37°C. The resulting monomer III was ligated with T4 ligase under conditions that are close to optimal for the yield of linear dimers. A satisfactory criterion is to ligate until the amount of dimer III is in excess of both the unligated monomer III and the trimer III DNA. The ligations were carried out with T4 ligase at 12°C. A concentration of ligase was chosen at which the criterion was met in about 60 min. Concentrations of monomer III of 120 to 250 μg/ml were used in order to avoid the formation of significant circular DNA. The dimer III was recovered from the ligation mixture as described under Electrophoresis. This dimer III consists of about one-half head-to-tail dimers and one-half a mixture of head-to-head and tail-to-tail dimers. The latter two species contain single strands of potentially snapback DNA that because of this property can be separated from head-to-tail dimer. Gels illustrating the characterization of the dimer and the subsequent annealing steps are shown in Fig. 2. Lane 1d of Fig. 2 shows dimer III after purification from a preparative gel of the ligation reaction mixture. It migrates as a single band at the expected position (mobility standard not shown). When this dimer was denatured by heat or alkali and renaturation was inhibited by low ionic strength and low temperature, the patterns shown in lanes 1c and 2c were obtained. A band of snapback DNA that runs as monomer III and two bands corresponding to the plus and minus head-to-tail dimeric single strands are seen. Their identity was proven by annealing methods and on these gels can be seen by comparing lanes 1b and 1c with 1a or lane 2c with 2a and 2b. In 1a, 2a, and 2b, the annealing with viral (+)-strand has proceeded, and it is evident that the lower of the two single-stranded bands has disappeared, identifying it as the (-)-strand. The identification of the polarity of the single strands of phage G4 is verified in gel 4 using the monomeric species. Lane 4a shows an RF sample in which monomer I and monomer II are present in about the same amount. The same sample denatured by heat at low ionic strength is shown in lane 4b. The identification of the faster moving bands as the(-)-strands was determined previously(15.Wheeler F.C. Fishel R.A. Warner R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 260-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The additional distinction between the linear and circular single strands was made possible by the low temperature at which the gels were run. The same experiment using ϕX174 DNA is demonstrated in lanes 4c and 4d. We attribute the greater mobility of ϕX (+)-strands and G4 (-)-strands to the fact that they both have a distinctly greater G + T content than their opposite polarity counterparts which would be expected to enhance the secondary structure, particularly at a low temperature.Figure 2:Agarose gel electrophoresis of G4 DNA and its annealing to form figure 8s. Agarose gels (1%) were run at 6°C for about 17 h and were stained with EtBr. All are of G4-DNA except lanes 4c and 4d which are of ϕX-DNA. Annealings of dimer III and viral DNAs were done in 2 mM EDTA, pH 8, at the NaCl concentration and the temperature indicated for 30 min: lane 1a, 50 mM NaCl at 60°C with a 10-fold excess of viral DNA; lane 1b, 25 mM NaCl at 45°C with a 10-fold excess of viral DNA; lane 2a, 50 mM NaCl at 65°C with a 1.5-fold excess of viral DNA; lane 2b, 50 mM NaCl at 65°C with a 10-fold excess of viral DNA. The dimer III used in the annealings is shown in lane 1d and after denaturation at 100°C in 2 mM EDTA and quick cooling in lane 1c. The purified figure 8s are shown in lane 3b along with markers in lane 3a. Gel 4 shows a sample of G4-RF in lane 4a and of ϕX-RF in lane 4c and after denaturation at 100°C, 1 mM EDTA in lanes 4b and 4d, respectively. The bands are identified in the figure as follows: 8, figure 8s; σ, one or two bands containing double-stranded circles with double-stranded tails formed during annealing; i, intermediate band formed during annealing at low ionic strength, lower than optimum temperature or at short time periods of annealing; mI, supercoiled monomer; mII, relaxed, circular monomer; mIII, linear, double-stranded monomer, in these gels DNA from palindromic, dimeric, single strands released during denaturation of the dimer III prepared by ligation; dII, relaxed, circular dimer; dIII, linear, double-stranded dimer, in lane 1d the dimer III is the purified product of ligation of monomer III and consists of all possible head and tail combinations of monomers, in other lanes the dimer III arises from a small amount of reannealing of d(+)- and d(-)-single strands; v, viral DNA, circular single (+)-strands; ml+, monomeric, linear, single (+)-strands and ml- for the corresponding(-)-strands; mc+, monomeric, circular, single strands and mc- for the corresponding(-)-strands; d(+) and d(-), dimeric, linear single strands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The progress of annealing dimer III with an excess of G4 viral strands is illustrated by gels 1 and 2 in Fig. 2. The DNA in lane 1b was annealed at 45°C for 30 min in 25 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA and in lane 1a at 60°C in 50 mM NaCl for 30 min. Lanes 2a and 2b were annealed at 65°C in 50 mM NaCl for 30 min, but in lane 2a there was only a small excess of viral DNA over the potential dimer(-)-strand and in 2b there was a 10-fold excess. The latter conditions provide optimum annealing. Both of these gels illustrate the formation of an intermediate, designated as the i band, that under longer annealing or different conditions is driven into figure 8s or into one of the two bands identified as σ bands. We refer to these as σ bands because by electron microscopic examination they were shown to consist mainly of double-stranded loops with double-stranded tails. Many of the loops are smaller than monomer length. The origin of these structures is not clear although a small contamination by linear (+)-strands in the viral DNA or by trimer III in the dimer III may contribute. We have not found any conditions under which this band is absent. However, the σ species and all other non-figure 8 DNAs are removed by the CsCl-EtBr gradient which yields figure 8s that migrate as a single band (Fig. 2, lane 3b). Electron micrographs of these figure 8s are shown in Fig. 3.Figure 3:Electron micrograph of annealed G4 figure 8s. Preparation from single-stranded G4 components as described in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The species derived from the dimer III that do not anneal with viral DNA, such as snapback double strands and dimer (+)-strands, are shown in these gels to persist and not to interfere with the annealing leading to figure 8s. The main conclusions are illustrated by the gel patterns shown in Fig. 2. While there is some residual non-figure 8 DNA present in the annealing mixture in addition to the excess viral DNA, none of this DNA bands with supercoiled DNA in EtBr. Highly purified figure 8s are obtained from the half-relaxed region of an equilibrium CsCl-EtBr gradient.The isolation of figure 8s from the CsCl-EtBr gradient demonstrates that there are no nicks in one half of the molecule. In the other half, the nick is at the EcoRI site, yielding finally X-forms with no nicks. The gel for the zero time branch migration sample usually shows a few percent of linear monomers, part of which may be migration runoff during sample preparation. An additional 5% peak, as yet unidentified, that does not branch migrate appears in the terminal runoff sample. In a conventional gel, Fig. 2, lane 3b, there is only one figure 8 band. We thus estimate the figure 8 content to be about 90%. The theoretical yield should be equal to half the amount of DNA in the purified dimer III sample, but because of the low yield in the annealing and the gradient steps we do not even come close. The best yield in several preparations was 10% of the dimer.Native Figure 8sA half-relaxed fraction, often barely visible, was collected from routine equilibrium CsCl-EtBr gradients of RF and pooled as a source of figure 8s. The pooled samples were rerun as necessary for the removal of contaminating relaxed or fully supercoiled species. The composition of such a half-relaxed fraction was shown in previous work (12.Fishel R.A. Warner R.C. Virology. 1986; 148: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) to consist chiefly of catenanes and figure 8s. The recovered half-relaxed fraction was restricted with EcoRI and was found to contain about 15% of the DNA as X-forms and most of the remainder as linear monomers. It was used for rate measurements of branch migration by the trioxsalen method. The RO was calculated as the fractional reduction with time in the X-peak, corrected for nonmigrating species which were determined on an extended-time runoff sample. Our previous work (12.Fishel R.A. Warner R.C. Virology. 1986; 148: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) includes as Fig. 2 a photograph of a gradient, in that case run with propidium diiodide, illustrating the resolution of half-relaxed DNA.Cruciform SubstratesIn addition to the figure 8, we have developed a new substrate for branch migration based on the cruciform. These cruciforms are particularly useful in that they can be made in a variety of sizes. The method of making them originated because of the availability of snapback configurations of G4 that were a by-product of our annealing procedure for figure 8s. The snapback DNA is shown as a single band on gels 1 and 2 of Fig. 2. This DNA consists of a mixture of head-to-head and tail-to-tail form III monomers, covalently closed at the EcoRI sequence at one end and having an open EcoRI sequence at the other. We isolated the DNA from gels, ligated it, and, after a heating and quick cooling, examined it by electron microscopy. The micrograph in Fig. 4 shows a mixture of dimer-size cruciforms and dimer-length linear molecules. The former arise because ligation of two head-to-head or two tail-to-tail monomers can yield cruciforms, but the ligated product from a head-to-head and a tail-to-tail monomer does not have a reverse complementary sequence extending from the EcoRI site at the center of the molecule and reanneals to a linear dimer after heating. This mixture of species both before and after ligation was avoided by the use of a second restriction enzyme.Figure 4:Electron micrograph of cruciform structures. Preparation is described in the text. The cruciforms are of dimer size (11,154 bp). Most of the linear double-stranded molecules are of the same size.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In our preparation, monomer III from restriction of supercoiled G4-RF with EcoRI was ligated to a high degree of linear ligation, and a limit digest of the product was made with XhoI which has two cleavage sites in G4. The two restriction fragments that are palindromic and contain EcoRI sites at their centers were isolated by gel electrophoresis. G4 DNA treated in this way yields a 716-bp fragment containing an EcoRI site at the head-to-head position and a 3694-bp fragment with an EcoI site at the tail-to-tail position, based on the definition of “head” as the end of monomer III made by EcoRI that contains a 5′-overhang on the (+)-strand. When these fragments were denatured by heating each yielded on cooling, a homogeneous snapback fragment half the length of the linear double strand which contained the EcoRI sequence in the snapback position and a free ligatable XhoI sequence at the other end. Ligation yielded covalently closed, double-stranded molecules 716 or 3694 bp in length. The steps in this preparation are illustrated in Fig. 5 for the 3694-bp cruciform. Similar small, covalently closed structures have been made by Mizuuchi et al.(21.Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. Gellert M. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), Wemmer and Benight(22.Wemmer D.E. Benight A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8611-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and by Erie et al.(23.Erie D.A. Jones R.A. Olson W.K. Sinha N.K. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We refer to these palindromic, double hairpins as cruciform precursors. Cruciforms can be made by heating and quick cooling the precursors as indicated above for the full-length G4 dimer. Each preparation from a precursor contained, in addition to a cruciform, an amount of the same size linear dimer in greater proportion from the 716-bp than from the 3694-bp precursor. The linear dimer is apparently formed as a result of the interaction between the nucleation event and the subsequent renaturation at each of two adjacent restriction sites as discussed under “Appendix.” In order to obtain a cruciform, there must be at least one initiation at an EcoRI sequence and one at an XhoI sequence. The interval of time between these two initiations must be less than the time required to propagate double-stranded structure from the first to yield a linear dimer. A longer DNA would thus be expected to be more favorable for cruciform formation.Figure 5:Outline of the synthesis of a cruciform substrate for branch migration. The formation of a 3694-bp cruciform is used as an example. The procedure begins with the tail-to-tail ligation of the mIII that results from the restriction of G4-RF by EcoRI. The DNA sequences of the single EcoRI site and the two XhoI sites in G4-RF are shown to illustrate the palindromic nature of the intermediates. The sequences cannot be shown to scale, but the asymmetry of the positions of the two XhoI sites are approximately correct in order to make it clear that a smaller cruciform of 716 bp would be formed from a head-to-head ligation in Step 1. Step 1, ligation of G4-RF mIII to yield a tail-to-tail dimer III; Step 2, restriction of the tail-to-tail dimer by XhoI; Step 3, a heat and cool step forms two 1847-bp snapbacks; Step 4, ligation of the snapbacks leads to a 3694-bp cruciform precursor; Step 5, another heat and cool step gives the product, the 3694-bp cruciform.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSStep Rate of Branch MigrationDuring the development of purified substrates, rate measurements were made that gave substantially lower step rates than we found in our initial work.

Csk may be involved in the down-regulation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling by C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck and Fyn; however, it is not known how Csk activity is regulated or how it targets these Src family members. We used Jurkat T cells and normal human T cells to examine proteins that bind to the SH2 domain of Csk. In both Jurkat and normal T cells, the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Csk bound constitutively to a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 60 kDa (p60). The 60-kDa protein was detected in Csk immunoprecipitates from both unstimulated and CD3-stimulated cells. In addition to p60, a protein of 190 kDa coprecipitated with Csk, and both proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the immunocomplex. Small amounts of GTPase-activating protein (GAP) were detected in anti-Csk immunoprecipitates, suggesting that p60 may be a GAP-associated protein. Our data demonstrate that the SH2 domain of Csk specifically associates with at least two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in normal human T cells, that this association is independent of TCR/CD3 activation, and that Csk may be a part of a multiprotein complex containing GAP.

Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Engagement of these receptors with their respective ligands activates the associated Src kinases, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular substrates, ultimately stimulating the effector functions of the cell, such as proliferation, gene transcription, cytokine production, and mediator release. The basic structure of the Src kinases is highly conserved between family members. In addition to their catalytic domain, Src kinases contain SH2 and SH3 domains, an N-terminal myristylation site that directs attachment to the cell membrane, and two regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation sites(9.Koch C.A.

Autophosphorylation of a tyrosine in the kinase domain serves to increase the activity of the kinases, whereas phosphorylation of a C-terminal tyrosine causes the kinase to fold into an inactive state (reviewed in (15.Cooper J.A.

T cell receptor Src homology 2 Src-homology 3 glutathione S-transferase monoclonal antibody polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis GTPase-activating protein. Csk (C-terminal Src kinase) was identified as a protein-tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates the C-terminal tyrosines of the Src kinases, thereby negatively regulating their activity(16.Nada S.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The essential role of Csk as a regulator of Src kinases has been extensively demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro(20.Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 21.Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5290-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The primary structure of Csk is similar to that of the Src family; however, Csk does not have an N-terminal myristylation site, a positive regulatory auto-phosphorylation site, or a negative C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue(15.Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that Csk may play a role in down-regulating activation signals in T and B cells. Csk is required for normal development of lymphoid cells(23.Gross J.A. Appleby M.W. Chien S. Nada S. Bartelmez S.H. Okada M. Aizawa S. Perlmutter R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); it is also abundantly expressed in adult thymus and spleen, suggesting that it is actively involved in the normal functioning of mature lymphocytes(1.Perlmutter R.M. Levin S.D. Appleby M.W. Anderson S.J. Alberola-Ila J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 451-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that TCR/CD3 stimulation results in the increased activity of Csk in Jurkat T cells(24.Oetken C. Couture C. Bergman M. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Williams S. Alitalo K. Burn P. Mustelin T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1625-1631PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, overexpression of Csk in T cell hybridomas resulted in inhibition of TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and greatly reduced interleukin-2 production(25.Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This effect could be reversed by the overexpression of constitutively active Lck. Analysis of B cell receptor signaling in Csk-deficient B cell lines revealed that Lyn was constitutively active and highly phosphorylated on its autophosphorylation site(26.Hata A. Sabe H. Kurosaki T. Takata M. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7306-7313Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that Csk acts to down-regulate Src kinases in the T and B cell receptor systems. It is of interest that only a fraction of Lck and Lyn are found to be phosphorylated on their C termini in unstimulated cells. This indicates that the activity of Csk may be continually balanced by the activity of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. In this regard it is noteworthy that Csk can phosphorylate CD45 in vitro, thereby creating a binding site for Lck(27.Autero M. Sahannen J. Pessa-Monkawa T. Soula-Rothhut M. Oetken C. Gassmann M. Bergman M. Alitalo K. Burn P. Gahmberg C.G. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1308-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The exact details of the interactions between the Src kinases, Csk, and CD45 have yet to be understood. Little is known about how Csk activity is regulated or with which proteins Csk associates in hematopoetic cells. In this study, we examined proteins that associate with the SH2 domain of Csk in Jurkat cells and normal human T cells. We found that Csk associates directly with two proteins, a heavily phosphorylated protein of 60 kDa and a protein of 190 kDa. Importantly, these associations were constitutive, and phosphorylation of neither protein was affected by TCR/CD3 stimulation. Small amounts of GAP were detected in anti-Csk immunoprecipitates, suggesting that p60 may be the human analog of the GAP-associated 60-kDa phosphoprotein recently reported to be associated with Csk in Src-transformed murine fibroblasts(28.Neet K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Unless specified, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Repligen or Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Radioactive isotopes and horseradish peroxidase-labeled second antibodies were purchased from Amersham Corp. The Jurkat cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing Hepes and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin, and 300 mg/liter L-glutamine. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) OKT3 against human CD3ε chain was purified from hybridoma culture supernatants using protein A-Sepharose column chromatography and used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for stimulation of the T cells. Antiserum 3622.3 generated against the 13 C-terminal amino acids of Csk (KEQLEHIKTHELHL) was generously supplied by Jonathan Cooper. Rabbit antiserum against the same peptide was subsequently raised in the laboratory and affinity purified using the same peptide coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia). Antisera #387 and #527 against TCR η chain were kindly supplied by Lawrence Samelson and Allan Weissman, respectively. Antibodies against ZAP-70 kinase, human Lck, Fyn, Src, phosphotyrosine-specific mAb 4G10, and anti-GAP mAb were purchased from UBI. Antiserum against the GAP-associated protein p62 and Shc were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antisera against GAP were generously provided by Frank McCormick and Tony Pawson, and anti-c-cbl antiserum was provided by Lawrence Samelson. Anti-FAK antibody and anti-Csk mAb were from Signal Transduction Laboratories. Human T cells from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteer donors were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing Hepes, 20 units/ml recombinant interleukin-2, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. To guarantee the T cell lineage, cells were stimulated with 3 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin for 10-14 days before restimulation with phytohemagglutinin in the presence of autologous feeder cells. Following the second stimulation the cells were allowed to rest for at least 10 days before use. After two rounds of stimulation with phytohemagglutinin, over 99% of the viable cells were CD3+ T cells, as shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using the anti-CD3 antibody, OKT3. The cells were harvested, counted, resuspended in RPMI, and stimulated with OKT3 as described for the Jurkat cells. The cDNA clone encoding Csk was generously supplied by Akira Imamoto; the cDNA encoding the SH2 domain of Csk in which the phosphotyrosine-binding FLVRES motif had been mutated to FLVSKI was kindly supplied by Brian Howell. DNA sequences encoding SH2 (amino acids 105-208), SH3 (amino acids 42-96), and SH2/3 (amino acids 42-208) of Csk were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers containing restriction sites for BamHI and EcoRI. The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the pGEX-2T (29.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5025) Google Scholar) vector using standard procedures(30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli strain JM109. After confirmation of the DNA sequences by dideoxy sequencing, fusion proteins were produced and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose. For fusion protein binding assays, unstimulated cells or cells that had been stimulated with 10 μg/ml OKT3 for the indicated times were harvested and lysed on ice with Triton lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The lysed cells were used at the equivalent of 5-10 × 107 cells/gel lane for the Jurkat cells and 1-5 × 107/gel lane for the normal T cells. Cell lysates were tumbled with 3-10 μg of glutathione-agarose immobilized GST-fusion proteins at 4°C for 4 h. In the SH2 mutant binding assays, lysate from 2 × 107 cells was incubated with 0.5 μg of fusion protein. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). For immunoprecipitation of Csk, the cells (1-5 × 107/lane) were lysed in a Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF). After centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g, the lysate was incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min to remove the OKT3 mAb used for activation. This was followed by a second preclearing for 30 min with normal rabbit serum, prebound to anti-rabbit Ig-conjugated agarose beads. The lysate was then incubated for 1 h with anti-Csk antibodies, prebound to anti-rabbit Ig conjugated agarose beads, washed three times in the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. In the coprecipitation experiments in Fig. 2, the antibodies were covalently coupled to protein-A Sepharose beads using dimethylpimelimidate (Pierce). The eluted material was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked in 10% Carnation milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The blots were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminiscence (Amersham Corp.). To analyze proteins that coprecipitate with Csk, Csk was immunoprecipitated from lysates of unstimulated or stimulated Jurkat cells (1 × 107 cells/lane). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once in Csk kinase buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM MnCl2). The beads were incubated in 20 μl of Csk kinase buffer with 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 22°C. After three washes with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitate was suspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% SDS. The samples were boiled for 5 min, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were collected. 10% of the supernatant (total kinase reaction) was analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE, whereas the rest was diluted 20 times with Triton lysis buffer. The diluted samples were incubated with 3-5 μg of immobilized fusion proteins for 1 h at 4°C. The adsorbed proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membrane (Bio-Rad), and visualized by autoradiography. To identify proteins that were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, the filters were treated with 1 N KOH for 2 h at 55°C as described(31.Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To assay the specific activity of Csk, variations of two previously published procedures were used(24.Oetken C. Couture C. Bergman M. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Williams S. Alitalo K. Burn P. Mustelin T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1625-1631PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5402-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the first procedure, Csk was immunoprecipitated from 1-5 × 106 cells as described above. The precipitate was washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once in Csk-kinase buffer. The activity of Csk was measured by analyzing the incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into a synthetic copolymer of (Glu, Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma), covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia) at 5 mg/ml. The Csk immunoprecipitate was incubated in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 μl of the copolymer beads at 30°C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 2% SDS. The beads were washed once in lysis buffer followed by several alternate washes in 50 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4, 0.5 M NaCl. The beads were washed once in water, and the bound radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. In the second procedure, Csk immunoprecipitation was performed using 10% slurry of formaldehyde-fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Sigma) instead of anti-rabbit IgG beads. The washed immunoprecipitates were incubated with 100 μg of soluble copolymer and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, for 5 min at 30°C. The S. aureus precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the copolymer was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by scintillation counting of the excised gel lanes. To identify proteins with which Csk interacts, recombinant GST fusion proteins encompassing the Csk-SH2, SH3, and SH2/3 domains were used in binding assays with lysates of unstimulated and OKT3-stimulated Jurkat cells (Fig. 1A). Several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins bound to the Csk-SH2 fusion protein, the two most prominent bands migrating with apparent molecular masses of 60 (p60) and 21 kDa (p21). p60 was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine, and its interaction with the Csk-SH2 domain was not activation-dependent. Upon shorter exposures of the film, p60 was shown to consist of two closely spaced bands. p21 also migrated as a doublet and interacted with the Csk-SH2 domain in an activation-dependent manner. Maximal interaction between p21 and Csk-SH2 occurred after 1 min of stimulation and started to decrease after 2 min. Neither the Csk-SH3 domain nor the GST control bound any tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Csk-SH2/3 bound the same set of proteins as did Csk-SH2 but apparently with higher affinity, consistent with previous reports concerning the influence of the flanking SH3 domain on the affinity of the SH2 domain toward phosphopeptides(33.Bibbins K.B. Boeuf H. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 34.Panchamoorthy G. Fukasawa T Stolz L. Payne G. Reedquist K. Shoelson S. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Walsh C. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6372-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Besides p21 and p60, four other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with apparent molecular masses of 120, 70, 52, and 25 kDa bound to the Csk-SH2, and more strongly to the SH2/3 domains (after a longer exposure of the blot, all four proteins were clearly seen to bind to Csk-SH2). Their interactions with SH2 and SH2/3 domains were also activation-dependent with a time course similar to the binding of p21. Using TCR immunoprecipitations, followed by reprecipitation with Csk-SH2 fusion proteins, the 21- and 25-kDa proteins were subsequently identified, respectively, as the η and ε chains of the CD3 complex; the 70-kDa protein was identified by Western blotting analysis as the protein-tyrosine kinase ZAP-70(35.Rafnar T. Schneck J.P. Brummet M.E. Marsh D.G. Catipovic B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To analyze which of the Csk-SH2-associated proteins in Fig. 1A interacts directly with Csk, we utilized the fact that SH2 domains recognize linear phosphopeptide sequences that persist after the three-dimensional structure of the proteins has been disrupted by denaturation. Lysates of unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat cells were boiled in 1% SDS, diluted 10 times with lysis buffer, and incubated with the immobilized Csk-SH2/3 fusion protein (Fig. 1B). Only the two major phosphoproteins, p60, and the η (p21) chain, were detected in the Csk-SH2/3 adsorbates; furthermore, when more cells were used, the ε chain was also shown to bind directly to Csk-SH2/3 (data not shown). The other three phosphoproteins, ZAP-70, p52, and p120 did not associate with the Csk-SH2/3 protein after denaturation. A Csk-SH2 mutant, in which the phosphotyrosine-binding motif had been changed from FLVRES to FLVSKI did not bind p60 (Fig. 1C) nor to any of the other phosphoproteins (data not shown). To examine which of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associate with Csk in vivo, Csk was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated and OKT3-stimulated Jurkat cells, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 2A). A 60-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was found to be associated with Csk in both unstimulated and stimulated cells; this protein comigrated exactly with the Csk-SH2/3-bound p60, and its phosphorylation state was not altered by OKT3-activation. Two other constitutively phosphorylated proteins of about 190 and 70 kDa were detected in the anti-Csk immunoprecipitate. The 70-kDa protein band was blurry and not consistently detected in all experiments; the 190-kDa band was only detected when a large number of cells was used. Neet and Hunter (28.Neet K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) recently reported that Csk associates with a GAP-associated protein of 60 kDa in murine fibroblasts overexpressing Src. This 60-kDa protein was initially identified as a substrate of the insulin receptor kinase (36.Hosomi Y. Shii K. Ogawa W. Matsuba H. Yoshida M. Okada Y. Yokono K. Kasuga M. Baba S. Roth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11498-11502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently (37.Ogawa W. Hosomi Y. Shii K. Roth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29602-29608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) shown to be distinct from the RNA-binding, GAP-associated 62-kDa protein previously described by Wong et al.(38.Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The mAb used to identify the GAP-associated murine p60 does not react with proteins of human origin. Therefore, to test if the human T cell p60 is associated with GAP, we examined whether GAP could be detected in anti-Csk immunoprecipitates and vice versa. A small amount of GAP was found to coprecipitate specifically with Csk from both unstimulated and TCR-stimulated T cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Csk and GAP may be brought down together by their common association with p60. However, no Csk could be detected in anti-GAP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B), further emphasizing the low stoichiometry of this possible indirect association. Previously, at least three proteins have been described that become phosphorylated and associate with GAP after growth factor stimulation(37.Ogawa W. Hosomi Y. Shii K. Roth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29602-29608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 39.Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These proteins have molecular masses of 60, 62 (Sam 68), and 190 kDa respectively. It is notable that when GAP is immunoprecipitated from unstimulated and TCR-stimulated Jurkat cells, at least three constitutively phosphorylated proteins of the same molecular masses coprecipitate with GAP (Fig. 2A). The constitutive phosphorylation pattern of the GAP-associated proteins in the Jurkat cells supports the hypothesis that the Csk-associated p60 may be a GAP-associated protein. To examine which of the Csk-associated proteins are substrates of Csk in vitro, Csk was immunoprecipitated from lysates of unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat cells, followed by an in vitro kinase assay. A sample of the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect radiolabeled proteins. To aid the detection of proteins that bind specifically to Csk-SH2/3, the radiolabeled immunoprecipitates were boiled in the presence of 1% SDS, diluted, and reprecipitated with immobilized Csk-SH2/3-GST fusion protein. Multiple proteins were phosphorylated in the Csk immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3). There was no detectable difference between the Csk-associated bands in unstimulated and OKT3-stimulated lysates. In both lysates, several bands were specifically associated with Csk; notably, in the total kinase assay, a strong band of 70 kDa and a fainter doublet of about 160 kDa were visible (Lanes 5 and 7). Strikingly, neither of these bands was specifically bound by Csk-SH2/3; instead, Csk-SH2/3 recognized a heavily phosphorylated band of 60 kDa and a fainter band of 190 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 8). The 60-kDa band comigrated on gels exactly with p60, suggesting that it may be the same protein. KOH treatment of the phosphorylated protein products demonstrated that both p60 and p190 were primarily phosphorylated on tyrosines, whereas almost all other phosphorylation was due to serine/threonine phosphorylation (data not shown). These two proteins are, therefore, substrates of a tyrosine kinase in the anti-Csk immunoprecipitates, most likely Csk itself. Because several lines of evidence suggest that Csk may play a role in TCR signaling(24.Oetken C. Couture C. Bergman M. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Williams S. Alitalo K. Burn P. Mustelin T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1625-1631PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Mustelin T. Immunity. 1994; 1: 351-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it was surprising that no change in the phosphorylation state of p60 was observed upon cell activation. Thus, one might speculate that the leukemic Jurkat cell line has a defect in its signaling machinery leading to constant phosphorylation of p60. To analyze a more physiological situation, we established human T cell lines and examined whether we could detect the same proteins. We were able to reproduce in the normal T cells all of the results we had previously obtained in the Jurkat cells. Thus, the Csk-SH2 fusion protein bound a tyrosine-phosphorylated doublet of 60 kDa in addition to the η chain of the TCR (Fig. 4A), and anti-Csk immunoprecipitates contained a 60-kDa phosphorylated protein (Fig. 4B). Identical to the Jurkat cells, the phosphorylation state of p60 did not change following activation. In addition to p60 and η, the Csk-SH2 fusion protein consistently precipitated a heavily phosphorylated protein of 120 kDa that was much more prominent than the 120-kDa protein detected in the Jurkat fusion protein assay; however, this protein was not detected in anti-Csk immunoprecipitates. Finally, in vitro kinase assays of Csk immunoprecipitates from normal T cells reproduced exactly the results obtained from the Jurkat cells (see Fig. 3), showing that both p60 and p190 were phosphorylated on tyrosines by a kinase activity in the immunoprecipitate and reprecipitated by Csk-SH2 (data not shown). The importance of Csk in T cell development and signal transduction is well documented(23.Gross J.A. Appleby M.W. Chien S. Nada S. Bartelmez S.H. Okada M. Aizawa S. Perlmutter R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25.Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 40.Mustelin T. Immunity. 1994; 1: 351-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); however, many questions concerning its activity and regulation remain unanswered. In our analysis of Csk-associated proteins, we detected a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 60 kDa that binds to the Csk-SH2 domain, both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, when adsorbed to the recombinant Csk-SH2 fusion protein, p60 presents as a doublet, whereas only a single band coprecipitates with Csk. Several attempts were made to identify the heavily phosphorylated 60-kDa protein doublet. Antibodies to multiple members of the Src family, including Lck, Fyn, Src, and an antibody raised to a conserved region in all Src kinases failed to specifically identify p60; similarly, antibodies against paxillin(41.Sabe H. Knudsen B. Okada M. Nada S. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the GAP-associated protein p62(38.Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), or the adaptor protein Shc did not react specifically with p60 (data not shown). A clue to the identity of p60 was recently provided by Neet and Hunter (28.Neet K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These investigators showed that Csk associates with a phosphoprotein of 60 kDa in murine fibroblasts that have been transformed by constitutively active Src. This protein was shown to be a recently identified GAP-associated protein that has different characteristics from the previously described RNA-binding GAP-associated protein p62(37.Ogawa W. Hosomi Y. Shii K. Roth R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29602-29608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the monoclonal antibody used to identify the GAP-associated protein in the aforementioned report does not react with human homologue(s), we attempted to detect GAP in Csk immunoprecipitates and vice versa. Small amounts of GAP were detected in Csk immunoprecipitates, whereas we were unable to detect Csk in anti-GAP precipitates. As this method tests for an indirect association between the two proteins, the sensitivity of the assay may be too low to yield positive results in the latter case. Also, the 190-kDa protein found in anti-Csk immunoprecipitates comigrates exactly with the GAP-associated p190, further suggesting that Csk and GAP may be associated by their common interaction with p60 and p190. If p60 is associated with GAP, it is possible that the 120-kDa protein observed in the Csk-SH2/3 fusion protein binding assays is GAP itself. When Western blots of the fusion protein precipitated material were probed with anti-GAP serum, the antibody bound reproducibly to a 120-kDa protein in both the Csk-SH2/3 and the GST control. Furthermore, the RNA-binding, GAP-associated p62 described by Wong et al.(38.Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) was also found to bind to the control GST beads. This nonspecific binding of p62/GAP to GST precluded the use of the fusion proteins to analyze the potential p60/GAP association. However, as the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP does not change with TCR/CD3 stimulation, it is likely that the 120-kDa protein detected in the fusion protein assays represents a different protein. We have tested the Csk-SH2/3 adsorbates with antibodies to FAK and c-cbl, but neither antibody recognized p120 specifically. Because Csk has been implicated in TCR signaling, it was of some surprise that the profile of proteins binding to Csk-SH2 was unaffected by TCR/CD3 stimulation. We made several attempts to measure the activity of Csk before and after OKT3 stimulation; however, the reliability of these measurements was questionable because of several confounding factors. First, our data demonstrated that a large amount of Ser/Thr kinase activity coprecipitates with Csk, complicating activity measurements, especially when kinase-deficient Src was used as a substrate. Because this contaminating activity was not reduced when affinity-purified anti-Csk antibodies were used, it is possible that Csk is associated with these kinases in vivo. To try to bypass the consequences of the Ser/Thr kinase activity, we used a synthetic Glu-Tyr polymer as a substrate for Csk, either covalently coupled to Sepharose or in solution. However, neither method produced consistent results in our hands. Presently, we believe that if there is a change in the activity of total cellular Csk after TCR/CD3 stimulation, it is too small relative to background to be detected using the tools we have available. If the cytosolic Csk exerts its effect on TCR signal transduction by phosphorylating the membrane-associated Lck and Fyn, it must be recruited to the membrane. In the light of our results, it is possible that Csk is linked to the membrane through an association with p60 and the GAP complex. However, it is unclear how this constitutive association might affect TCR signaling. In our fusion-protein assays, Csk-SH2 specifically recognized the phosphorylated η and ε chains in T cell lysates, suggesting a way by which Csk might be recruited to the TCR. However, we were not able to detect η in anti-Csk immunoprecipitates nor Csk in anti-TCR precipitates using Western blotting techniques, possibly because preclearing of the lysates with protein A-Sepharose to remove the OKT3 antibody may have removed a large portion of the CD3 components. In this regard, several lines of evidence support that the interaction between Csk-SH2 and η may have physiological significance. First, our own data show that Csk-SH2 recognizes a very limited set of phosphoproteins in T cell lysates, in contrast to the wide variety of proteins recognized by SH2 fusion proteins of other signaling molecules ((42.Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and data not shown). Thus, Csk-SH2 behaves in a manner similar to ZAP-70-(SH2)2, whose highly specific binding to η has a crucial role in TCR signaling(43.Chan C.A. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Second, our data are in accord with the results of other investigators who have analyzed the associations of proteins with the TCR. Takeuchi et al.(44.Takeuchi M. Kuramochi S. Fusaki N. Nada S. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Matsuda S. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Okada M. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27413-27419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Fyn coprecipitates with Csk from activated T cells, but the nature of this binding was not pursued. These results are consistent with our data if Fyn were co-immunoprecipitated with Csk through the association of both kinases with the TCR. Wange et al.(45.Wange R.L. Kong A.N. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11685-11688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the co-immunoprecipitation of the TCR with three activated kinases that migrated with apparent molecular masses of 50, 70, and 120 kDa. These kinases were detected as a result of their ability to bind to a nonhydrolyzable photoaffinity analog of ATP. The p50 kinase did not autophosphorylate during the in vitro kinase assay, implying that this kinase lacks this ability. Thus, our data are consistent with the p50 kinase being Csk itself. Our results contrast with a previously published report where Csk-associated proteins in Jurkat cells were analyzed by anti-Csk coprecipitation and in vitro binding to Csk-SH2 fusion proteins(24.Oetken C. Couture C. Bergman M. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Williams S. Alitalo K. Burn P. Mustelin T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1625-1631PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, only a single 72-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was found to associate with Csk in vivo and in vitro. Notably, this protein was shown not to have any kinase activity. We also detected a 70-kDa phosphoprotein that associated indirectly with recombinant Csk-SH2 in Jurkat cell lysates; however, we identified this protein as the protein-tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. Furthermore, a 70-kDa protein coprecipitated with Csk from unstimulated and OKT3-stimulated Jurkat cells, as shown by both phosphotyrosine blotting and in vitro kinase assay. However, this protein did not associate directly with the SH2 domain of Csk. Notably, we did not detect a 70-kDa protein in Csk-SH2 adsorbates or anti-Csk immunoprecipitates from normal T cells. We do not have a specific explanation for the observed discrepancies between our results and the previous report, although differences in the Jurkat cell lines and/or reagents used could be responsible. In summary, we have detected two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that associate with Csk-SH2 in T cells. These proteins may be a part of a complex that contains the GTPase-activating protein GAP, linking Csk to proteins that serve as regulators of the Ras pathway. Our current data suggest that TCR/CD3 stimulation does not alter the binding or phosphorylation state of these Csk-associated proteins. Therefore, if Csk plays a role in the early signaling events of the TCR, modulation of its activity must be by a mechanism other than SH2 binding. We thank Dr. S.-K. Huang for help with the T cell cultures, Drs. S.-K. Huang and F. Imani for critical review of the manuscript, and Dr. Richard Roth for valuable discussion."
