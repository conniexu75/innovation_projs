https://openalex.org/W2080145523,"A major function of Rac2 in neutrophils is the regulation of oxidant production important in bacterial killing. Rac and the related GTPase Cdc42 also regulate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, necessary for leukocyte chemotaxis and phagocytosis of microorganisms. Although these GTPases appear to be critical downstream components of chemoattractant receptor signaling in human neutrophils, the pathways involved in direct control of Rac/Cdc42 activation remain to be determined. We describe an assay that measures the formation of Rac-GTP and Cdc42-GTP based on their specific binding to the p21-binding domain of p21-activated kinase 1. A p21-binding domain glutathione S-transferase fusion protein specifically binds Rac and Cdc42 in their GTP-bound forms both in vitro and in cell samples. Binding is selective for Rac and Cdc42 versusRhoA. Using this assay, we investigated Rac and Cdc42 activation in neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells. The chemoattractant fMet-Leu-Phe and the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate stimulate formation of Rac-GTP and Cdc42-GTP with distinct time courses that parallel cell activation. We also show that the signaling pathways leading to Rac and Cdc42 activation in HL-60 cells involve G proteins sensitive to pertussis toxin, as well as tyrosine kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activities.

Small GTPases of the Ras superfamily serve as key regulators in the control of intracellular signaling pathways. GTPases regulate molecular events by cycling from the inactive GDP-bound state to active GTP-bound forms. This GDP/GTP cycle is regulated by the interaction of the GTPases with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 1The abbreviation used is: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PBD, p21-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein(s); PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; fMLP, fMet-Leu-Phe; DTT, dithiothreitol; BHK, baby hamster kidney; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviation used is: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PBD, p21-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein(s); PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; fMLP, fMet-Leu-Phe; DTT, dithiothreitol; BHK, baby hamster kidney; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activated GTPases interact with specific target proteins that serve as effectors to regulate downstream signaling cascades. The Rho GTPase subfamily, which consists of the closely related GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, has been implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular functions, including actin cytoskeletal dynamics, oxidant generation, transformation, membrane trafficking, apoptosis, transcription, and cell cycle control (2Hall A.

Polymorphonuclear neutrophils are circulating cells that can be rapidly activated in response to inflammatory signals to adhere and migrate through the extracellular matrix to sites of infection and/or inflammation. At these sites, bacteria are phagocytized and killed through the secretion of granules and oxidants. Many studies indicate that small GTPases are involved at various levels to regulate the cellular functions involved in the inflammatory process (1Bokoch G.M.

The first identified biological activity of Rac was regulation of oxidant production by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (3Bokoch G.M.

Rac2 appears to be a required NADPH oxidase component in human neutrophils, and there is evidence to implicate direct interactions with both p67phox (13Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W.

Cdc42 induces actin polymerization in neutrophil extracts (16Zigmond S.H. Joyce M. Borleis J. Bokoch G.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have been implicated in the migratory responses of leukocytes to chemoattractant stimuli (17Laudanna C.

Moreover, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are also involved in a variety of leukocyte signaling pathways, including activation of phospholipase D (21Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q.

Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar. Whereas activation of the Rho GTPases is clearly critical for controlling the inflammatory responses of human leukocytes, the upstream signals and regulatory proteins controlling Rho family GTPase activation in these cells remain largely unknown. Among the Rho GTPase targets identified in the neutrophil, the p21-activated kinases (PAK1 and -2) were initially found to be activated after fMet-Leu-Phe stimulation (24Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Binding of Rac- or Cdc42-GTP leads to PAK autophosphorylation and activation of the ability to phosphorylate exogenous substrates on serine and/or threonine residues (25Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Substrates for PAK in human neutrophils may include the p47phox and p67phox NADPH oxidase components (24Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 26Ahmed S. Prigmore E. Govind S. Veryard C. Kozma R. Wientjes F.B. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 activate PAK through binding to the p21-binding domain (PBD). This sequence, located in the N-terminal regulatory part of the protein, contains a highly conserved 14-amino acid CRIB domain (amino acids 74–88) found in many proteins interacting with Rac- or Cdc42-GTP (27Burbelo P.D. Dreschsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Whereas the minimal CRIB domain is sufficient for the binding of Rac and Cdc42, a larger sequence is required for high affinity interaction (amino acids 67–150) (28Leonard D.A. Satoskar R.S. Wu W.J. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Thompson G. Owen D. Chalk P.A. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7885-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and effective activation by GTPases (30Knaus U.G. Wang Y. Reilly A.M. Warnock D. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21512-21518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have used the PBD domain of PAK1 as a probe to specifically isolate the active forms of Rac and Cdc42 from human neutrophil samples. Activation of Rac2 and Cdc42 by the chemoattractant fMet-Leu-Phe and the general stimulus phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) occurs with distinct time courses that parallel cellular activation by these agents. We have also investigated the signaling pathways involved in Rac2 and Cdc42 activation by chemoattractant, including the participation of heterotrimeric G proteins, tyrosine kinases, and PI 3-kinase. The PAK PBD-based assay provides a simple and direct means to determine Rac and Cdc42 activation in cells. Human neutrophils of 90–95% purity were prepared from freshly drawn blood from healthy volunteers collected in acid/citrate/dextrose. Neutrophils were purified by dextran sedimentation, hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes, and centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque, as described (31Badwey J.A. Curnutte J.T. Berde C.B. Karnovsky M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cells were diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated, washed with 0.9% NaCl, and finally resuspended in Krebs-Ringer Hepes buffer containing 5.5 mm glucose (KRHG) for experiments. Human pro-myelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells stably transfected to express the fMLP receptor (32Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5704-5715PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in a selective RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.8 mg/ml geneticin. The cells (0.8 to 1.0 × 106/ml) were differentiated into neutrophil-like cells by treatment with 1.4% Me2SO for 5 days. The cDNA of the GTPase-binding domain (PBD) from human PAK1 (amino acids 67–150) or from Schizosaccharomyces pombe PAK1 (amino acids 135–227) was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T3 and pGEX-2T, respectively, and was expressed inEscherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. The purified fusion proteins were isolated from glutathione-Sepharose beads with 10 mm reduced glutathione and stored at −80 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2m DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. The cDNA fragment encoding Rac2 wild type and Rac2 mutants Q61L and T17N were subcloned in the pSFV3 vector, and the recombinant virus was generated per Life Technologies, Inc. instruction manual. BHK (baby hamster kidney) cells were infected with virus in Glasgow minimum essential medium complete media (Life Technologies, Inc.) and allowed to grow 15 h before cell lysis in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm orthovanadate. Cells (2 × 107/assay) were suspended in KRHG containing 1 mm Ca2+ and stimulated with 10−6m fMLP (fMet-Leu-Phe) or 100 ng/ml PMA at 37 °C for the times indicated. In some experiments, cells were pretreated for 15 min at 37 °C with the following inhibitors, 100 μmgenistein, 20 μm LY294002, 30 nm wortmannin, or for 24 h with 20 ng/ml pertussis toxin. At the appropriate time, cell activation was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm orthovanadate) in the presence of 8 μg of GST-PBD. Cell lysates were immediately placed at 4 °C and then clarified by low speed centrifugation at 4 °C. Recombinant GTPases, cytosolic GTPases, or cell lysates were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and 100 μm GTPγS or 1 mm GDP to facilitate nucleotide exchange (33Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loading reaction was stopped by addition of 60 mm MgCl2. Recombinant or cytosolic GTPases and 8 μg of GST-PBD in a volume of 100 μl were incubated with 200 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and 5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 30 min (recombinant proteins) or 1 h (cell samples) at 4 °C. The bead pellet was then washed 3 times with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 times with the same buffer without Nonidet P-40. The bead pellet was finally suspended in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted for the appropriate GTPase using specific R786 (Rac2) and R785 (Rac1) antibodies (34Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Cdc42 polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-87), and the RhoA monoclonal from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-418). Immunoblots were detected with the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit from Pierce and/or by alkaline phosphatase detection. Signals detected were within the linear range of the detection method using Kodak X-Omat AR film, as determined with recombinant Rac and Cdc42 standards (1–64 ng). Equivalent experimental results were obtained using the human PAK PBD and the S. pombe PAK PBD. Recombinant Rac1 was loaded with [35S]GTPγS or [3H]GDP as described (33Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then free nucleotides were removed by centrifugation in a Centriplus 10 filtration unit. For saturation binding experiments, 10 pmol of Rac1 [35S]GTPγS was incubated with increasing amounts of GST-PBD and 5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. For competition binding experiments, 200 pmol of GST-PBD was incubated with 10 pmol of Rac1-[35S]GTPγS and increasing amount of Rac1 loaded with unlabeled GTPγS added either at time 0 or 30 and 60 min after the start of the incubation. After 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed 5 times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and the radioactivity bound to the beads was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Recombinant Rac1 or Cdc42 (50 ng) were preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP or [35S]GTPγS, and GTP hydrolysis was determined in the presence or absence of 4 μg of GST-PBD as described (35Chuang T.H. Xu X. Knaus U.G. Hart M.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 775-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide generation was determined by reduction of cytochrome c as in Ref. 36Bokoch G.M. Prossnitz V. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar. The PAK protein exhibits a selective affinity for the GTP-bound form of Rac or Cdc42 (25Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). We first verified that this specificity for the active conformation of the GTPases is maintained in the isolated PAK GST-PBD fusion protein. Purified GST-PBD was used as a probe in an affinity precipitation assay with different nucleotide-bound forms of recombinant Rac1. Fig. 1a shows that GST-PBD effectively interacts with the active GTPγS-bound form of the GTPase. There was little or no interaction with the inactive GDP-bound form. We verified that Rac1-GTPγS did not bind nonspecifically to GST beads or to glutathione-Sepharose beads alone. To confirm this result, we investigated the interaction of GST-PBD with overexpressed cytosolic GTPases. BHK cells overexpressing Rac2 wild type, the constitutively GTP-bound active form (Q61L), or the GDP-bound (T17N) inactive form were lysed and used for the affinity precipitation assay (Fig. 1b). GST-PBD did not interact with wild type Rac2 loaded with GDP nor the T17N mutant. In contrast, GST-PBD effectively bound and precipitated the active forms of Rac2, including the wild type Rac2 when loaded with GTPγS and the Q61L mutant which is constitutively GTP-bound due to its inability to hydrolyze bound GTP. In each case, the unbound GTPases were recovered in the reaction medium. These results show that GST-PBD is interacting specifically with the active form of isolated recombinant or cellularly expressed GTPases. It has previously been shown that the PAK1 binds Rac and Cdc42 but not Rho (24Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 25Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). To determine if the GST-PBD domain behaves with the same selectivity, cytosolic fractions of neutrophils, known to express Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, and RhoA, were loaded with GTPγS or GDP. The affinity precipitation assay with GST-PBD was performed, and the presence of each GTPase was assessed with specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1c, GST-PBD interacts with Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42 but not Rho. The specificity observed with full-length PAK1 is thus maintained in the isolated PBD. In order to characterize the interaction of GST-PBD with the GTPase, we performed binding studies with recombinant GTPases loaded with labeled nucleotides. The amount of GST-PBD required to effectively complex with and pull down the GTPases was determined by loading Rac1 with [35S]GTPγS and incubating with increasing amounts of GST-PBD (Fig. 2a). Binding was saturable and required levels of GST-PBD at least 20 times the total amount of recombinant Rac1 to recover more than 90% of the GTPase, as expected by mass action. Experiments where GST-PBD was incubated with Rac1-[35S]GTPγS in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled Rac1-GTPγS demonstrated that the interaction was competitive (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the addition of Rac1-GDP was ineffective (not shown). We then performed the same experiment, but this time the unlabeled Rac1-GTPγS was added either 30 or 60 min after the initial binding of labeled Rac1-GTPγS to the GST-PBD. Measuring the stability of the first interaction, we observed that labeled Rac1 remained tightly bound to GST-PBD (Fig. 2b). These results indicate that the PBD-GTPase complex, once formed, is of high affinity and is stable. This interaction has been estimated to have a K d of ∼30 nm (28Leonard D.A. Satoskar R.S. Wu W.J. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been reported that both intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis are blocked when Rac or Cdc42 is bound to PAK (25Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 28Leonard D.A. Satoskar R.S. Wu W.J. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since GTP hydrolysis by endogenous GTPases can occur during affinity isolation with GST-PBD and potential GAP activity may be present in cellular samples, the inhibition of this loss of active GTPase would be desirable for an assay to detect GTPase activation. To assess the potential effect of the GST-PBD to inhibit GTP hydrolysis in cellular samples, recombinant Cdc42 loaded with the hydrolyzable nucleotide [γ-32P]GTP was added to neutrophil cytosol, and GTP hydrolysis was determined in the presence or absence of GST-PBD. The presence of GST-PBD was observed to decrease, but not totally prevent, GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42 (Fig. 2c). To confirm that we were measuring GTP hydrolysis and not nucleotide dissociation, the same experiment was performed with Cdc42 loaded with the poorly hydrolyzable nucleotide [35S]GTPγS. We observed that the amount of [35S]GTPγS remaining bound to the Cdc42 only decreased very slowly, indicating that appreciable dissociation was not taking place under the conditions of the binding assay. The lack of complete inhibition of GTP hydrolysis by the PBD suggests that, in order to avoid loss of GTP-bound GTPase due to hydrolysis, the GST-PBD incubation period should be kept short. This is balanced, however, by the time needed for association of the GTP-GTPase with the PBD protein; 30-min to 1-h incubations appear to give optimal results. Neutrophils were stimulated with 1 μm fMLP or 100 ng/ml PMA, and activation of Rac and Cdc42 was investigated using the GST-PBD binding assay. Stimulation by fMLP led to a rapid and transient activation of both Rac2 and Cdc42. Analysis at various times after stimulation with fMLP showed that activation of Rac2 and Cdc42 peaked between 30 s to 1 min, followed by a decrease in levels of active GTPase (Fig. 3a). Stimulation with PMA also induced Rac2 and Cdc42 activation, but the formation of GTP-GTPase was slower, reaching the maximal level of activation at 5 min after stimulation. The relative amount of activated GTPase formed with each stimulus was compared with the total amount of activable GTPases present in the cell lysates, as determined by preloading the total GTPase in the sample with GTPγS (leftmost panels in Fig. 3, a and b). We estimated that ∼2 (fMLP) to ∼5% (PMA) of Rac2 and ∼5 (fMLP) to 10% (PMA) of Cdc42 are activated out of the total available cellular GTPase pool. Previous studies from our laboratory had used the stimulus-dependent translocation of Rac2 to the plasma membrane as a measure of GTPase activation in human neutrophils (34Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation of Rac2 in response to either fMLP or PMA occurs with an identical time course as does Rac2 activation determined with the PBD assay; in both cases this correlates well with activation of NADPH oxidase activity (not shown here, but see Ref. 34Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the amounts of Rac2 shown to translocate upon stimulation with fMLP or PMA were similar to the fraction that we could directly measure as being activated, suggesting that the assay was accurately measuring the level of GTP-Rac2 formed. Interestingly, however, whereas the formation of Rac2-GTP measured here was transient, peaking by 1 or 5 min, respectively, with fMLP and PMA, the translocated Rac2 remains membrane-associated for a much longer period (34Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that once membrane-bound, the Rac2 may be stabilized in a protected complex with other NADPH oxidase components. We observed a similar time course of GTPase activation in the promyelocytic cell line HL-60 differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (Fig. 3b). The time course of activation by fMLP and the relative fraction of active Rac2 and Cdc42 formed were essentially the same as in peripheral human neutrophils (Fig. 3a), suggesting that similar mechanisms of activation for Rac and Cdc42 may exist in this differentiated promyelocytic cell line. In contrast to fMLP, stimulation with PMA in HL-60 cells appeared to somewhat slower in stimulating the increase in active Rac and Cdc42, although peak activation was still observed by 5 min. Again, this correlated well with the kinetics of NADPH oxidase activation (not shown). Analysis of GTPase activation in neutrophils and HL-60 cells at early times was difficult due to the rapidity of the response and because of the well known propensity of the leukocytes to become partially activated by contact with test tube surfaces. This surface-induced activation seemed to cause increases in the basal (unstimulated) levels of active Rac and Cdc42. Stimulation in response to fMLP at early times was therefore carefully analyzed by averaging the early time point data obtained from several separate experiments with different leukocyte preparations (Fig. 3c). Activation was clearly evident by 30 s and remained the same or slightly increased by 1 min. The fMLP receptor is known to couple to activation of neutrophil functional responses via a pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric Gi protein (37Bokoch G.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1984; 39: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Treatment of HL-60 cells with pertussis toxin effectively inhibited Rac2 activation (Fig. 4). The pathway leading to Rac/Cdc42 activation thus requires the initial coupling of the fMLP receptor to Gi and places the activation of these small GTPases downstream of the heterotrimeric G protein. The involvement of soluble tyrosine kinases in fMLP receptor signaling has been suggested by the ability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors to block fMLP-mediated cell activation, including the fMLP-induced membrane translocation of Rac2 (38Dorseuil O. Quinn M.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that fMLP receptor stimulation causes activation of the src-related kinase, Lyn, through an association with the Shc adaptor protein (39Ptasznik A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We observed that treatment of HL-60 cells with 100 μmgenistein prior to fMLP stimulation blocks Rac2 and Cdc42 activation (Fig. 5). These data directly indicate the involvement of tyrosine kinase activity in the pathway leading to Rac2 and Cdc42 activation. PI 3-kinase has been shown to be involved in an upstream signaling pathway required for Rac activation in fibroblasts (40Hawkins P.T. Eguinou A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activity is also required for chemoattractant receptor signaling, as the specific PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 are able to decrease superoxide production and many other neutrophil functions (41Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Schnyder J. Ruch W. Cooper P.H. Payne T.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 169: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 42Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem.

Rothfuss K.J. Serlin B.S. Simpson P.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2413-2422PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formed in human neutrophils requires a tyrosine kinase-linked pathway involving the classical forms of PI 3-kinase (45Ptasznik A. Prossnitz E.R. Yoshikawa D. Smrcka A. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25204-25207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), although a G protein subunit-regulated enzyme may also be involved (46Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In order to determine if PI 3-kinase activity was required for fMLP-induced Rac2 and Cdc42 activation in human neutrophils, we treated cells with 5–30 nm of wortmannin or 5–20 μm of LY294002 prior to stimulation with fMLP. Substantial, but not complete, inhibition of Rac or Cdc42 activation was observed with both inhibitors (Fig. 5). In each experiment, NADPH oxidase activity was measured and was found to be totally inhibited at the inhibitor concentrations utilized. Thus, both PI 3-kinase-regulated and independent mechanisms for Rac and Cdc42 activation may exist in human neutrophils. Although roles for Rac and Cdc42 in human leukocyte function have been demonstrated, the ability of inflammatory mediators to stimulate the formation of Rac-GTP or Cdc42-GTP has not been previously established. By using a specific assay based on the GTPase-binding domain of PAK, we demonstrate the formation of GTP-Rac2 and GTP-Cdc42 in human neutrophils stimulated with the chemoattractant fMLP or the phorbol ester PMA. Activation of both Rac2 and Cdc42 in response to fMLP is rapid, peaking at 0.5 to 1 min. This time course corresponds well to the activation of the Rac- and Cdc42 effectors PAK1 and -2 in these cells (24Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), as well as to activation of the NADPH oxidase (34Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor-induced activation of Rac2 also correlates with the translocation of Rac2 to the plasma membrane, as previously reported (34Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This translocation has been shown to require the formation of Rac2-GTP in vitro (47Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting difference observed was that while Rac2 activation was transient, the Rac2 protein itself appears to remain membrane-associated for longer periods. It is possible that we are only measuring that fraction of activated GTPase that remains accessible to the GST-PBD in our assay and that the membrane-associated Rac2 enters into a higher affinity complex with NADPH oxidase and/or other effectors. The formation of such a protected complex was previously suggested by the inability of addition of a Rac-GAP to inhibit oxidase activity once the membrane-associated complex was assembled (48Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Settleman J. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the Rac2 may remain membrane-associated even after conversion to the inactive GDP-form, suggesting cycling to the cytosol (via GDP dissociation inhibitors) may lag behind inactivation of the GTPase. Quantitative comparison of the amount of Rac2 or Cdc42 which becomes PBD-associated versus the total level of GTPase present which can be loaded with GTP indicates only a fraction of the total becomes active in response to fMLP or PMA. Again, this conclusion is consistent with the previous observation that only a (similar) fraction of Rac2 translocates in response to stimulation with these agonists (34Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity of the relative amount of Rac activated as determined using the two separate methods suggests that the PBD assay is not seriously underestimating the amount of active GTPases formed. Certainly the results of Fig. 2c suggest that GTP hydrolysis during the assay could potentially cause some underestimation of the amount of GTP-GTPase detected. Furthermore, it is likely that some portion of the GTP-Rac or Cdc42 formed is bound by other effector targets prior to association with the added PBD domain. We have attempted to minimize these potential factors by addition of the PBD during the cell lysis step and by maintaining samples on ice. However, one can expect that the assay will only be semi-quantitative, reflecting accurately the time course of activation but not absolute levels of GTP-GTPase. The activation of Rho family GTPases by cellular stimuli is thought to most likely be due to the activation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (47Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the PBD assay enabled us to measure directly the chemoattractant- and phorbol ester-stimulated formation of Rac2-GTP and Cdc42-GTP, we used pharmacologic agents to investigate the signaling components necessary for GTPase activation. Rac2 activation in response to fMLP was effectively inhibited by treatment with pertussis toxin, indicating that the GTP exchange reaction is initiated downstream of the heterotrimeric G protein coupled to this receptor. The activation was also sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and, partially, to PI 3-kinase inhibitors, indicating the need for tyrosine kinase activity and PI 3-kinase activity upstream of the putative GEF(s). Although this could reflect the activity of multiple GEFs regulated by each pathway independently, it is of interest that both tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding are necessary components for activation of the Vav Rac/Cdc42 exchange factor (49Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Busteol X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 50Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). As Vav is expressed only in myeloid cells (51Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), it becomes a prime candidate for mediating Rac and Cdc42 activation by the N-formyl peptide receptor. In conclusion, we have developed and characterized a specific assay for the formation of GTP-Rac and GTP-Cdc42 in cells. By using this assay, we demonstrate the activation of Rac2 and, for the first time, Cdc42 in human neutrophils in response to chemoattractant receptor activation and phorbol ester stimulation. The similarities in the activation kinetics of both GTPases and their similar pharmacologic inhibition profile suggest that their activation may be catalyzed by the same GEF. In addition, because we show Cdc42 becomes activated rapidly, with kinetics correlating with those of leukocyte functional responses, Cdc42 can potentially be involved in regulation of some of these responses. Identification of the GEF(s) responsible for chemoattractant receptor signaling to Rac and Cdc42 remains an important goal for future investigations.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviation used is: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SSR, simple sequence repeat; bp, base pairs; nt, nucleotide(s); PAA, polyacrylamide; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. is a membrane-spanning 170-kDa glycoprotein that stimulates cell growth after binding of specific ligands (1Savage Jr., C.R. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7609-7611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Carpenter G. Cohen S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). It has been found to be expressed in many normal and malignant cell types (3Adamson E.D. Rees A.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 34: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Overexpression of EGFR alone is sufficient to transform NIH 3T3 cells in an EGF-dependent manner (4DiFiore P. Pierce J. Fleming T. Hazon R. Ullrich A. King C.R. Schlessinger J. Aaronson S.

Transcription of the EGFR gene starts at multiple initiation sites within the GC-rich promoter that lacks a TATA or CAAT box (8Ishii S. Xu Y.-H. Stratton R.H. Roe B.A. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc.

It has been shown that the first intron of several genes including EGFR has important regulatory function (9Chrysogelos S.A.

A. 1992; 89: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Two enhancer elements with cooperative function in the receptor gene have been identified, upstream of the promoter and downstream in intron 1 (13Maekawa T. Imamoto F. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5488-5494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and EGFR transcription is in part prematurely terminated in intron 1 (14Haley J.D. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1746-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) with 14–21 CA dinucleotides and a heterozygosity of 72% in a Caucasian reference pedigree (15Chi D.D. Hing A.V. Helms C. Steinbrueck T. Mishra S.K. Donis-Keller H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was revealed close to the downstream enhancer element. It was already demonstrated for the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene, that a CA repeat in one of the two promoter regions can repress promoter activity (16Tae H.J. Luo X. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This repression can be released by a tissue-specific factor or by removal of the dinucleotide repeat. Therefore, we raised the question whether the CA-SSR could also play a role in epidermal growth factor receptor expression. The close proximity of the EGFR downstream enhancer to the CA repeat in intron 1 led us to the hypothesis that variations in the number of these dinucleotides could be partially responsible for individual differences of the EGFR proto-oncogene expression found in humans. To probe a potential regulatory function of this highly polymorphic region, we investigated the influence of the CA-SSR on transcription activity in vitro and characterized RNA synthesis in the EGFR 5′-region in relation to the number of dinucleotide repeats. For this purpose, we applied an in vitro method for quantitation of RNA synthesis from different DNA templates in a reproducible, homogenous, and cell-free transcription factor matrix. Nuclear extract from A431, a cell line with high EGFR expression capacity, was used as a model for studying the regulation of EGFR transcription. By using this approach, it was also possible to detect all occurring RNA species simultaneously, including prematurely terminated pre-mRNAs. A431 (epidermoid carcinoma cell line), MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-474 (cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% FCS), HBL-100 (mammary cell line, cultured in RPMI 1640, 5% FCS), and MCF-7 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MKN7 (gastric carcinoma cell line, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, 1:1, 10% FCS) was a generous gift of Prof. C. C. Benz, University of California San Francisco. If not otherwise specified, the cell lines were derived from breast carcinomas and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS at 5% CO2. Genomic DNA of cell lines was prepared with the QiaAmp tissue kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA concentration was determined with a UV photometer. A 114–128-bp PCR fragment containing the polymorphic region was amplified with 50 pmol of previously described primers (15Chi D.D. Hing A.V. Helms C. Steinbrueck T. Mishra S.K. Donis-Keller H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One of the primers was labeled with fluorescein at the 5′-end. The 50-μl PCR reaction mixture contained 200 ng of DNA of cultured cells, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma), 100 μm dNTP each (Perkin Elmer), 1× PCR amplification buffer, 1.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega), and light white mineral oil (Sigma). After PCR, 1 μl of the products plus 0.3 μl of Genescan 500 TAMRA molecular weight standard (Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems) were denatured in 12 μl of formamide, separated in an Applied Biosystems Prism 310 genetic analyzer with POP4 polymer, and fragment lengths were determined. 250 ng of genomic DNA were used in a 50-μl PCR reaction with 0.55 mm MgCl2, 7.5% Me2SO, 50 μm dNTP each, 1× PCR amplification buffer (Promega), a blend of 2.5 units Taq polymerase (Promega) with 1 unit Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 35 pmol of the following primers: B1/1, CCT TCA GAG ACA GCA AAG GGC; B1/2, CCT GAA ACC AGA ACT CGG ACA AGG C (5′–3′). The polymerase mixture was added to the reaction after overlaying with mineral oil, 4 min of denaturation at 100 °C, and cooling to 95 °C. Cycling profile: 1st cycle, 95 °C for 30 s; 62 °C for 1 min 30 s; 72 °C for 5 min; 2nd to 32nd cycle: 95 °C for 2 min 30 s; 62 °C for 1 min 30 s; 72 °C for 5 min in a Robocycler Gradient 40 (Stratagene). After amplification, several 50-μl aliquots of reaction mixtures were combined, DNA was ethanol precipitated, resolved in TE buffer and electrophoresed through a 0.7% agarose gel in 1× TBE running buffer. The product band was cut from the gel and purified using QiaEx (Qiagen). Finally, the UV-quantitated DNA was again ethanol precipitated and resolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate treated water. The products were stored at −20 °C until used for further analysis. Equal amounts of the purified EGFR 4,050-bp PCR products from A431 and each other cell line were combined and denatured for 4 min at 100 °C under a mineral oil layer. Following the addition of one-ninth volume 10× PCR amplification buffer for efficient hybridization, the mixture was cooled for 10 min in a 42 °C heating block and kept at room temperature until loaded with Ficoll loading dye on a native 5% PAA, 1× TBE mini gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 15 V/cm for 3 h. Homo- and heterodimers were detected by ethidium bromide staining. Transcription in vitrowas carried out as described previously (17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Approximately 50 ng of PCR product was combined with 6 μl of 1× transcription buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water), 1 μl of RNasin, 2 μl of 50 mmMgCl2, 1 μl of 10 mm NTP mix (all Promega), 5 μl of A431 nuclear extract (25 μg of protein, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to a final volume of 25 μl. Following careful mixing, transcription took place for 1 h at 30 °C, before 2.9 μl of 10× restriction buffer and 10 units of the restriction enzyme PstI were added to obtain smaller DNA fragments and improve efficiency of the later transfer to a nylon membrane. The solution was incubated further for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, 71 μl of stop solution (0.3m Tris (pH 7.4), 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 3 μg/ml tRNA) was added, and the nucleic acids were extracted with 100 μl of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) before ethanol precipitation in the presence of 1 μl of GlycoBlue coprecipitant (Ambion) to increase recovery. Nucleic acid pellets were resolved and denatured at 95 °C in formamide loading dye and electrophoresed for 2.5 h at 25 V/cm through an 8-cm, 4% PAA, 8 m urea gel in 1× TBE. For nucleic acid transfer to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the gel was semi-dry blotted with 0.5× TBE for 45 min at 200 mA. After the transfer, the damp filter was UV irradiated at 302 nm on a transilluminator for 1 min and treated three times with boiling 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS solution to omit unspecific background in nonradioactive detection. For hybridization, the filter was pre-incubated for 1 h at 68 °C in hybridization buffer (5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5% dextran sulfate, 5% liquid block, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before 5 ng/ml fluorescein-UTP (RNA labeling mix, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) labeled RNA probe was added. The EGFR 5′-region-specific probe was generated by T7 RNA polymerase from a 4,050-bp PCR product with a corresponding promoter site incorporated in the downstream primer. Hybridization was carried out at 68 °C for 16 h. Stringency washes were 10 min at room temperature in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 2× 10 min at 68 °C in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Subsequently, the bands were detected with the Gene Images detection module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), involving an anti-fluorescein monoclonal antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase and CDP-Star chemiluminescence substrate. Digital chemiluminescence imaging was carried out with a LumiImager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and band intensities were integrated after 60-min exposures with the LumiAnalyst (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) software. For quantification, intensities of the two RNA bands were normalized to the 1,051-bp DNA template band in the same lane. In vitro run-off transcription was performed as described but without PstI treatment. DNA was instead digested with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extracted and precipitated in the presence of 50 μg of yeast RNA and a fluoresceinated antisense RNA, transcribed from a 572-bp PCR product plus T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 3′-end. The probe spanned a region from nucleotide +892 to +1463 in the EGFR intron 1. RNase protection analysis was performed with the HybSpeed ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion) according to the included protocol. After final precipitation of protected fragments, the RNA was denatured and electrophoresed through a 6% PAA, 8 m urea mini gel. RNA transfer and nonradioactive detection was performed as described. A specific competitor with an internal deletion of 20 nt of a 143-bp fragment specific for the exon 1-intron 1 boundary of the EGFR gene was constructed according to the method of Celi et al. (24Celi F.S. Zenilman M.E. Shuldiner G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product contained a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and was transcribed in vitro. The gel-purified competitor RNA was quantitated by UV absorption measurement. 500 ng of total RNA from cell lines and 10−18or 10−19 mol of the competitor was subjected to reverse transcription and PCR (Titan One Tube RT-PCR system, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 20 pmol each of the following specific primers: primer A, GAG AGC CGG AGC GAG CTC TTC GG; primer B: GAG CCG CGA GAC ACG CCC TTA CC. The two RT-PCR products were separated, and fluorescence was detected with a Prism 310 genetic analyzer. Peaks were integrated with the Genescan software (Perkin Elmer-Applied Biosystems). The molar amounts of the pre-mRNA template was calculated by the method reported by Roetger et al. (19Roetger A. Brandt B. Barnekow A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To eliminate the influence of gene amplification or loss of heterozygosity on protein expression, protein concentrations were divided by the EGFR gene dosage. To characterize sequence and function of the EGFR promoter/enhancer region, we amplified a 4,050-bp PCR product from several cell lines. It contained most of the upstream enhancer (nucleotides −1439 to −1109; +1 corresponds to the start of exon 1), the promoter region, exon 1, a polymorphic CA-SSR, and a downstream enhancer site in intron 1 (+1788 to +2318) of the EGFR gene (Fig. 1). Because of the locally very high GC content and the ability of this region to form stem loops and triplex structures (8Ishii S. Xu Y.-H. Stratton R.H. Roe B.A. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4920-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 9Chrysogelos S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5736-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), especially stringent conditions with unusually low Mg2+ concentration under 1 mm, an organic solvent that reduces secondary structure formation (18Shen W.-H. Hohn B. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 227Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and a special blend of Taq DNA polymerase with a proof reading enzyme had to be applied to obtain this long amplicon. The exact number of CA repeats in the PCR products was determined by microsatellite PCR and fragment analysis with an internal DNA size standard. We used heterodimer analysis to check for further differences in the sequence of the EGFR promoter/enhancer region in the cell lines used for this study. A431, an epidermoid carcinoma cell line with an amplified EGFR gene, was used as a reference, because reported EGFR sequence data were obtained from this cell line (14Haley J.D. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1746-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After hybridization of the A431 4,050-bp PCR product with the fragment from each other cell line, we found homodimer bands of identical products and heterodimers bands formed by nonidentical fragments (Fig. 2). Heterodimers run more slowly in native PAA gels due to the presence of unpaired bases in DNA double strands. The PCR product of A431 formed no detectable heterodimer when denatured and rehybridized alone. MDA-MB-231 with the same CA-SSR (Table I) also provided no detectable heterodimers with A431. All other cell lines with higher numbers of CA repeats formed a single heterodimer band running more slowly with increasing differences in their polymorphic regions. Even the 2-bp difference in A431/MDA-MB-468 heterodimers was clearly detectable. Because we were able to detect differences with an at least 2-bp resolution and heterodimer bands corresponded exactly to the previously determined allelic pattern of cell lines, we conclude that detected heterodimer bands were induced only by known polymorphic differences, and there was no evidence for mutations in these cell lines.Figure 2Heterodimer formation. EGFR 4,050-bp PCR products from cell lines with the previously determined number of CA repeats on top of each lane were denatured and hybridized before electrophoresis through a native 5% polyacrylamide, 1× TBE mini gel at 15 V/cm for 3 h. Bands were stained with ethidium bromide. A DNA size standard with fragment lengths in kilobase pairs is shown in the left lane (M). The arrow on theright side indicates the position of homodimers with regular electrophoretic mobilities. Heterodimers were detected above the homodimer band when two fragments with different numbers of CA repeats were involved. Retention of heterodimers increases with growing differences in the polymorphic region. No additional bands are detected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ICharacteristics of the cell lines usedCell lineCA repeatsTranscription activity in vitroGene dosageEGFR pre-mRNA%attomolA4311691 ± 30331.836 ± 0.367MDA-MB-23116109 ± 3610.037 ± 0.007MDA-MB-4681758 ± 1915.50.158 ± 0.032HBL-1001857 ± 1910.009 ± 0.002BT-4741834 ± 1110.007 ± 0.001MKN72018 ± 610.027 ± 0.005MCF-72121 ± 70.50.002 ± 0.000The number of CA repeats in intron 1 of the EGFR gene was determined by microsatellite PCR, EGFR gene dosages, previously published (19Roetger A.

EGFR pre-mRNA concentrations were measured by competitive RT-PCR. Open table in a new tab The number of CA repeats in intron 1 of the EGFR gene was determined by microsatellite PCR, EGFR gene dosages, previously published (19Roetger A. Brandt B. Barnekow A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), or unpublished data from our laboratory. EGFR pre-mRNA concentrations were measured by competitive RT-PCR. To examine the influence of the CA-SSR in intron 1 on EGFR gene transcription we used seven PCR products from cell lines that contained no detectable mutations within the 5′-region but different numbers of CA repeats from 16 to 26. Rare alleles with 14, 15, or 19 CA repeats with frequencies below 3% could not be found in any for us accessible cell line. Transcription in vitro of these PCR products with A431 nuclear extracts resulted in RNA double bands of approximately 1,550 and 1,650 nt from all templates. Fig. 3A shows representative results from one of three experiments with accordant findings. The DNA template is detected as multiple fragments due toPstI restriction digestion. Unspecific origin of the observed RNA bands can be ruled out because of the stringent hybridization and washing conditions and the negative control experiments that displayed no transcription-derived bands (Fig. 3A, +RNase, no DNA). In an experiment with template amounts from 10 to 100 ng, we showed that the RNA product yield divided by the DNA template amount is approximately constant within these limits (Fig. 3B). When band intensities of the 1,650-nt nuclear transcription in vitro products are divided by the amount of template DNA (represented by the 1,051-bp PstI fragment), significant differences between PCR products with different numbers of CA repeats become obvious (Fig. 5A). Relative transcript amounts vary 5-fold from fragments with 16–21 CA. In triple experiments, a coefficient of variation of 33% was found. A correlation of transcription activity in vitro with the number of CA repeats in intron 1 is manifested by declining relative transcription activities with increasing counts of dinucleotides. Approximately the same course is revealed when using the 1,550-nt instead of the 1,650-nt transcript band for quantitation. The ratio of the two run-off products (1,650:1,550 nt) fluctuates around 0.8 (data not shown), a value that reflects the use of two major in vitro transcription start sites under our conditions.Figure 5Transcription activity in vitroand in vivo. A, run-off transcription product bands were quantitated in relation to the DNA content of each lane. Relative RNA quantity therefore indicates the run-off transcription activity in vitro. Results were combined and arranged in order of the number of CA repeats in DNA templates. Activities are given in percent, relative to the fragments with 16 CA dinucleotides. B, in vivo levels of EGFR exon 1/intron 1-specific pre-mRNA in cell lines determined by competitive RT-PCR. Amounts per 500 ng of total RNA are given in attomoles. Individual values for each cell line (see Table I) were arranged in order of the number of CA repeats in the EGFR intron 1 and divided by the EGFR gene dosage to avoid effects of gene amplification and loss of heterozygosity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further characterized and confirmed the identity of the two in vitro transcribed pre-mRNA species by a ribonuclease protection assay. We hybridized nuclear transcriptionin vitro products in solution with an RNA probe that spanned the approximate region of transcription termination estimated from the length of nuclear run-off transcription products (Fig. 4). The probe included the CA repeat with 5′- and 3′-flanking regions plus a 20-nt T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5′-end. Controls of the RNase protection assay demonstrated integrity of the RNA probe (−RNase) and the absence of self-protecting structures or unspecific hybridization (−Transcr.). Hybridization of the probe with nuclear run-off products and subsequent digestion of single-stranded RNA (+RNase) provided a single product that was slightly shorter than the undigested probe. Consequently, the point of termination can be mapped to a site immediately before the 3′-end of the probe at nucleotide +1,463. Since there is no second termination site detectable within the region of the elongation block in our assays, we deduce that the double band is due to two major start sites between nucleotides −107 and −257 (8Ishii S. Xu Y.-H. Stratton R.H. Roe B.A. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4920-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) in transcription in vitro under our conditions. After we have shown that transcription activity in vitro depends on the number of CA repeats in intron 1, we wanted to know if the data in vitrocorrespond to the effective EGFR RNA expression in vivo. We measured the amount of EGFR pre-mRNA specific for the end of exon 1 and start of intron 1 from the indicated cell lines by competitive RT-PCR (Table I). Fig. 5Bshows the results with respect to the CA-SSR and after normalization to an EGFR gene dosage of 1. A431 and MDA-MB-468 have EGFR genes amplified 33-fold or 15.5-fold, respectively and MCF-7 is hemizygous for EGFR as determined by competitive differential PCR (19Roetger A. Brandt B. Barnekow A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is obvious that the fragments with 16 and 20 CA repeats exhibit disproportionately elevated pre-mRNA expression levels when compared with the other fragments. But in general, molar amounts of pre-mRNA normalized for gene dosages also show a tendency of declining expression with increasing numbers of CA repeats. Transcription of the EGFR gene and the structure of the 5′-region of the gene has been extensively investigated. The promoter region as well as parts of intron 1 are exceptionally GC-rich and potential secondary structures like stem loops and triple helices were described (8Ishii S. Xu Y.-H. Stratton R.H. Roe B.A. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4920-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 9Chrysogelos S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5736-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A short palindrome sequence 2 kilobase pairs upstream from exon 1 with predicted cruciform structure has been linked to termination of transcription in nuclear run-on experiments with isolated A431 nuclei (14Haley J.D. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1746-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the action of promoter and enhancers relative to the length of a polymorphic region in intron 1, we decided to use an approach with transcription in vitro of PCR products that contained all known regulatory elements of the EGFR gene. In seven tumor cell lines, we found no signs of mutation in the 5′-region by heterodimer analysis at a resolution of at least 2 bp (Fig. 2). Therefore we used PCR products from these cell lines as templates in our assay and determined the number of CA repeats in intron 1. Transcription in vitro mimics the initiation of transcription in vivo in a constant transcription factor matrix. Influences of differentially expressed transcription factors or gene copy numbers are excluded by use of cell free extracts in excess and DNA transcription templates in any concentration. A431 nuclear extract provides elevated transcription activity. Hence, products are easy to analyze and the situation in cells with high amounts of positive transcription factors but also with transcriptional repressors (14Haley J.D. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1746-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hou X. Johnson A.C. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4307-4312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) active on the EGFR gene promoter and enhancers can be examined. Quantification of transcripts appropriately reflects the activity of promoters and enhancers in the DNA applied as long as it is normalized to the DNA content of the in vitro run-off mixture, all other components are present in the same concentrations and activities and nucleic acid transfer efficacy is identical. Therefore, transcription activities may be compared only on the same blot and if the same batch of nuclear extract has been used. In contrast to reporter gene assays, the necessity of cloning DNA fragments into expression vectors and limitations due to unknown plasmid transfection efficiencies and post-transcriptional regulation are omitted. Moreover, additional information can be obtained, for example about different RNA species and initiation or termination sites within the examined DNA segment. Problems connected with quantitation of signals on x-ray films like low linearity of signal/response ratios and the requirement for multiple exponations were resolved by use of a chemiluminescence imager with a high dynamic quantification range. In a study of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene, it was demonstrated (16Tae H.J. Luo X. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that a nonpolymorphic sequence of 28 CA repeats within the promoter region can repress the activity of one of the two promoters by 70%. However, in this special case mediation of promoter inhibition seems to require a CAAT box. In the case of EGFR, a similar effect is observed although there is no CAAT box in the promoter region, and the CA-SSR is located more than 1,000-bp downstream of the promoter. Interestingly, differences in the number of CA repeats in the EGFR intron 1 show different levels of transcription modulation. Fig. 5A shows the association of decreasing transcriptional activity with increasing numbers of CA repeats. In addition, it could be demonstrated by ribonuclease protection assays that transcriptionin vitro with A431 nuclear extracts terminates at a site near the polymorphic region in intron 1 (Fig. 4). As already mentioned in a previous study, EGFR transcription was found to be in part prematurely terminated approximately 2-kilobase pairs downstream of exon 1, a site about 540-bp further downstream than our observed termination site. This discordance may be explained by the use of a 1-kilobase pair probe in the earlier reported run-on hybridization experiments, which covers our termination sites as well as the more downstream site. Therefore multiple termination sites spanned by this probe would appear as a single block. On the other hand, presence of a low abundant longer transcript that was not detected in our experiments is possible, because transfer efficiency of lengthy nucleic acids from PAA gels is significantly reduced. We conclude that our results suggest a dual function of the polymorphic region. First, an indirect effect that enhances or represses transcription in vitro up to 5-fold depending on the number of CA repeats, and second, a block of RNA elongation unaffected by the length of the SSR. To examine whether the observed effect in vitro also has importance in vivo, we measured EGFR pre-mRNA expression levels of the cell lines used and normalized the results to the EGFR gene dosages. Fig. 5B also shows declining transcription levels with increasing numbers of CA repeats except for the 20 CA allele. The corresponding cell line MKN7 obviously uses other mechanisms to up-regulate EGFR transcription despite the CA-SSR effect. The cell lines with 16 CA fragments also appear to further enhance EGFR transcription. As seen in the in vitro experiments, the number of CA repeats can mediate an up to 5-fold transcription repression or activation in our A431 model. Up-regulation by the action of transcription factors could easily overcome this more basal effect. Taken together, these data demonstrate that allele-dependent modulation of EGFR transcription can be observed in carcinoma cell lines in vivo, but not surprisingly, there are other regulation mechanisms that can outweigh it. To elucidate the function of the CA stretch in transcription modulation, we considered properties affecting the bendability of the EGFR downstream enhancer region. Bending of DNA in a sequence-dependent manner has an important function in many biological events like DNA replication, site-specific recombination, and transcription (21Travers A.A. Klug A. Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Habor, NY1990Google Scholar). Helical conformation analysis (22Gabrielian A. Pongor S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Gabrielian A. Simoncsits A. Pongor S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) on the basis of the CA-SSR and flanking sequences indicate that the dinucleotide repeat is highly flexible. The intrinsic DNA curvature propensity of the poly-CA stretch, a measure for helical asymmetry frequently associated with a rigid conformation, is remarkably low, whereas the bendability is prominently elevated. The longer the CA stretch, the longer the highly bendable section becomes, too. This could favor a DNA secondary structure that supports or hinders binding of a factor to the neighboring enhancer element if the polymorphic segment is prolonged. In this way, a transcriptionally active protein that binds downstream of the CA-SSR could serve as a mediator of allele dependent modulation of EGFR transcription. This report describes the association of decreased transcription activity with a prolonged polymorphic sequence in the EGFR intron 1 close to an enhancer region. The results are important for the understanding of EGFR proto-oncogene expression and probably other genes with comparable constellations of CA repeats and transcriptionally regulative elements. The knowledge of microsatellite function in relation to negative or positive enhancers provides new insights in individually different gene expression and the linkage of inherited polymorphisms to serious diseases like cancer.

Here, we use recombinant targeted luciferases and photon counting imaging to monitor changes in free [ATP] in subdomains of single living MIN6 and primary β-cells. Resting [ATP] in the cytosol ([ATP]c), in the mitochondrial matrix ([ATP]m), and beneath the plasma membrane ([ATP]pm) were similar (∼1 mm). Elevations in extracellular glucose concentration (3–30 mm) increased free [ATP] in each domain with distinct kinetics. Thus, sustained increases in [ATP]m and [ATP]pm were observed, but only a transient increase in [ATP]c. However, detectable increases in [ATP]c and [ATP]pm, but not [ATP]m, required extracellular Ca2+. Enhancement of glucose-induced Ca2+ influx with high [K+] had little effect on the apparent [ATP]c and [ATP]m increases but augmented the [ATP]pm increase. Underlying these changes, glucose increased the mitochondrial proton motive force, an effect mimicked by high [K+]. These data support a model in which glucose increases [ATP]m both through enhanced substrate supply and by progressive Ca2+-dependent activation of mitochondrial enzymes. This may then lead to a privileged elevation of [ATP]pm, which may be essential for the sustained closure of KATP channels.

Luciferase imaging would appear to be a useful new tool for dynamic in vivo imaging of free ATP concentration. Increases in extracellular glucose concentration stimulate the exocytosis of insulin from islet β-cells. This is probably achieved by an increase in glycolysis and flux through the citrate cycle (1Ashcroft F.M. Kakei M. J. Physiol. 1989; 416: 349-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), leading to elevated intracellular levels of likely coupling factors (2Prentki M. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: S32-S41Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), including ATP. Closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (3Ashcroft F.M. Harrison D.E. Ashcroft S.JH.

Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) then leads to plasma membrane depolarization and the influx of Ca2+ through voltage gated Ca2+ channels. Increases in the total intracellular concentration of ATP have been measured in isolated islets (6Meglasson M.D. Nelson J. Nelson D. Erecinska M. Metabolism. 1989; 38: 1188-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and cell lines (7Civelek V.N. Deeney J.T. Kubik K. Schultz V. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) exposed to increases in extracellular glucose concentration. However, the measured changes are generally small and difficult to interpret because of the large depot of intragranular ATP, and the presence of non-β-cells (8Detimary P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, such measurements give no indication of the concentration of unbound ATP. Unfortunately, measurements of free [ATP] in living cells, for example by 31P NMR (9Scholz T.D. Laughlin M.R. Balaban R.S. Kupriyanov V.V. Heineman F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H82-H91PubMed Google Scholar), cannot easily be extended to the islet micro-organ and do not provide sufficient sensitivity to detect changes at the cellular or subcellular level. This is an important question because differences in [ATP] at different intracellular sites have been predicted. In particular, locally high ATP consumption by the plasma membrane Na+-K+ and Ca2+-ATPase, may mean that [ATP] is lower in this domain than in the bulk of the cell cytosol (1Ashcroft F.M. Kakei M. J. Physiol. 1989; 416: 349-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Similarly, the electrogenic nature of the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocase (10Klingenberg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1979; 4: 249-252Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar) is predicted to create differences in ATP/ADP ratio across the inner mitochondrial membrane (cytosolic high). The role of changes in free Ca2+ ion concentration ([Ca2+]) in regulating β-cell metabolism and ATP concentration is controversial. Increases in [Ca2+] following plasma membrane depolarization act both to stimulate ATP requiring processes (i.e. secretory granule movement and exocytosis) (11Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar) and possibly to enhance mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (12Denton R.M. McCormack J.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 13McCormack J.G. Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 391-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Recent measurements of total ATP content of whole islets have suggested that the former may dominate and that Ca2+ influx may diminish glucose-induced increases in ATP/ADP ratio (14Detimary P. Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The use of firefly luciferase, targeted to discrete intracellular domains, should provide an extremely sensitive method of monitoring free [ATP] dynamically and at the subcellular level. In previous studies, we have shown that photon counting imaging of total luciferase activity in single cells provides a convenient means to measure changes in gene expression in single cells (15Rutter G.A. White M.R.H. Tavare J.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 890-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Luciferase has previously been employed to measure intracellular ATP concentration in single cardiac myocytes (17Bowers K.C. Allshire A.P. Cobbold P.H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1992; 24: 213-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and hepatocytes (18Koop A. Cobbold P.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but only after microinjection of the purified protein. In recent reports, Maechleret al. (19Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20770-20778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have shown that expression of recombinant luciferase provides a means of monitoring cytosolic ATP concentration in large populations (>10,000) of INS-1 β-cells. Unfortunately, such measurements fail to take account of the likely heterogeneity in the behavior of individual β-cells (21Pipeleers D. Kiekens R. Ling Z. Wilikens A. Schuit F. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S57-S64Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Here, we use photon counting to image ATP concentrations dynamically and at the subcellular level in single living primary β-cells and derived MIN6 cells. We further extend this technique to allow the imaging of [ATP] in two cellular subdomains, the mitochondrial matrix and the subplasmallemal region, by the molecular targeting of luciferase. We demonstrate that exposure to elevated glucose concentrations causes increases in [ATP] in each of the compartments analyzed, coincident with an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential. Comparison of the kinetics of [ATP] changes, and dependence on increases in mitochondrial free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]m), 1The abbreviation used is: [Ca2+]m, [Ca2+]c, and [Ca2+]pm, free Ca2+concentration in the mitochondrial matrix, cytosol, and plasma membrane regions, respectively; cLuc, cytosolic firefly luciferase; mLuc, mitochondrial matrix firefly luciferase; pmLuc, plasma membrane firefly luciferase; ΔΨ, mitochondrial membrane potential, TMREE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester.1The abbreviation used is: [Ca2+]m, [Ca2+]c, and [Ca2+]pm, free Ca2+concentration in the mitochondrial matrix, cytosol, and plasma membrane regions, respectively; cLuc, cytosolic firefly luciferase; mLuc, mitochondrial matrix firefly luciferase; pmLuc, plasma membrane firefly luciferase; ΔΨ, mitochondrial membrane potential, TMREE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester. also suggests that activation of strategically located mitochondria may preferentially enhance [ATP] immediately beneath the plasma membrane. Cytosolic (untargeted) firefly luciferase in plasmid pGL3 basic (Promega) was placed under cytomegalovirus immediate gene control by subcloning the cytomegalovirus promoter element from plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as an 876-nucleotide BglII-HindIII fragment into the upstream multiple cloning site of pGL3, generating plasmid cLuc. Plasma-membrane targeted luciferase was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 617-nucleotide translated region (minus stop codon) of synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa cDNA, with primers 5′ T.TTT.GAC.GAG.ACC.ATG.GCC.GAG.GAC.GCA and 5′TT.TTC.CAT.GGT.ACC.ACT.TCC.CAG.CAT.CTT (NcoI sites underlined) and the 629-nucleotide polymerase chain reaction fragment digested and subcloned into the plasmid pGL3-control (Promega) under SV40 immediate early gene promoter control, generating plasmid pmLuc. Correct orientation of the insert was verified by restriction mapping with SmaI and SalI, and confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. To allow higher levels of expression of this construct under cytomegalovirus promoter control, theHindIII-BamHI fragment of pmLuc was subcloned into plasmid pcDNA3; essentially identical data were obtained with either plasmid. For the preparation of mLuc, DNA sequences encoding a mitochondrial presequence and the hemagglutinin HA1 tag were added to the luciferase cDNA as follows. A fragment of wild-type luciferase cDNA was first amplified from plasmid pGL2 (Promega) using the following primer: 5′AAAG.CTT.AAT.GGA.AGA.CGC.CAA.AAA.CAT.AAA.GAA.A (corresponding to the sequence encoding amino acids 1–9 of luciferase;HindIII site underlined) and GAA.GAT.GTT.GGG.GTG.TTG.TAA.CAA.T (downstream of the endogenousClaI site of the luciferase cDNA and encoding amino acids 456–465). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with the enzymes HindIII and ClaI and fused in frame to the ClaI/HindIII fragment encoding the HA1 tag (22Bastianutto C. Clementi E. Codazzi F. Podini P. De Giorgi F. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A ClaI fragment was thus generated that, in an appropriately prepared pBSK+ plasmid, could be fused in frame with theEcoRI/HindIII fragment encoding the amino-terminal 33 amino acids of cytochrome oxidase subunit 8 (COX8) (25 amino acids of the cleavable presequence plus 8 amino acids of the mature polypeptide) (23Rizzuto R.

Chem. 1989; 264: 10595-10600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the ClaI/SalI fragment encoding the carboxyl-terminal portion of luciferase (amino acids 457–556). The whole final construct (shown schematically in Fig. 1) was excised via PstI/SalI digestion and cloned into the expression vectors VR1012 (Vical Research Inc., San Diego, CA) under modified cytomegalovirus promoter control. Primary rat islet β-cells were isolated by collagenase (PanPlus, Serva) digestion and purified on a discontinuous bovine serum albumin gradient (16Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A.

Cells were dissociated with trypsin before 24 h culture on Cell-TakTM-treated glass coverslips. Plasmids (0.2–0.4 mg·ml−1 in 10 mm Tris, 0.2 mmEDTA) were microinjected using glass borosilicate capillaries and an Eppendorf 5171 transjector/micromanipulator, as described (16Kennedy H.J.

MIN6 cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips (25Pouli A.E. Karagenc N. Bright N. Arden S. Schofield G.S. Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1399-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Injected primary β-cells cells were cultured 16–24 h in an atmosphere 5% CO2, and at 3 mmglucose. For all experiments in which the effects of elevated glucose or K+ concentrations were tested, MIN6 cells were cultured at 3 mm glucose for 24 h before imaging. Such cells responded robustly to elevated glucose concentrations with enhanced insulin secretion (4–10-fold above basal levels) (26Zhao C. Rutter G.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were imaged in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium (0.2 ml) comprising 125 mm NaCl; 3.5 mm KCl; 1.5 mmCaCl2; 0.5 mm MgSO4; 0.5 mm KH2PO4; 2.5 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm Hepes-Na+, pH 7.4, containing the indicated glucose concentration and equilibrated with 95:5 O2:CO2. Cells were maintained on the temperature-controlled (37 °C) stage of an Olympus IX-70 microscope (UPlanApo × 10, 0.4 numerical aperture air objective), located in a sealed dark housing. Medium was rapidly (<2 s) changed by the addition of an equal volume through a remotely located syringe. For calibration of signals, cells were lysed in “intracellular medium” comprising 20 mm Hepes, 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 10.2 mm EGTA, 6.67 mmCaCl2, 1 mm luciferin, 20 μg·ml−1 digitonin plus additions of ATP, MgSO4, and CoA as indicated. Data were captured with an intensified charge-coupled device camera comprising a low-noise S-20 multi-alkali photocathode and three in-series microchannel plates (Photek ICCD216; Photek Ltd., St. Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, United Kingdom), maintained at 4 °C. Single photon events were captured at 25-ms intervals by time-resolved imaging, which allowed the spatial and temporal coordinates of each photon event to be held in matrix format. In this way, luminescence changes of any individual cell or group of cells could be analyzed for the entire time course of an individual experiment. When required, images corresponding to the selected area of interest within the image field were generated retrospectively over the desired integration period. Aequorin imaging was performed in cells expressing mitochondrially targeted aequorin (27Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) as described previously (24Rutter G.A. Burnett P. Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Tavare J.M. Denton R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5489-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C for 2 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3 mm glucose, and then loaded with TMREE (10 nm) for 60 min. Confocal imaging was performed in KREBS, initially containing 3 mm glucose, using a Leica TCS-NT inverted confocal microscope, fitted with a × 40 oil immersion objective, with illumination at 568 nm from a krypton/argon laser. Fluorescence from groups of 4–7 single cells was analyzed off-line; this compensated for the considerable movement of individual mitochondria in and out of the confocal plane. Cells were fixed and permeabilized 24 h after microinjection using 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde plus 0.2% Triton X-100. Primary polyclonal rabbit anti-luciferase antibody (Promega) was revealed with tetra-methyl-rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Sigma). Confocal images were obtained using a Leica TCS 4D/DM IRBE laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser (568 nm excitation line) and analyzed off-line using a Silicon Graphics workstation. MIN6 cells were transiently transfected with the lipoamine Tfx-50TM(Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were extracted into buffer comprising 20 mm Hepes, 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.2) and assayed in intracellular medium (see above) using an LB-9501 luminometer (EG & Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Data are presented as means ± S.E. for the number of observations given. ForK m measurement of the different luciferases, statistical significance was determined by Fischer test for the improvement in fitting individual K m values compared with fitting a common value (28Woodward R.H. Davies O.L. Goldsmith P.L. Statistical Methods in Research and Production. Longman Group Ltd., London1972: 178-236Google Scholar). ATP content of MIN6 cell populations was determined in extracts using firefly lantern extracts (29Stanley P.E. Williams S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 29: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Intracellular pH was measured by monitoring fluorescence changes at the single cell level using 2′7′-bis(carboxyethyl) 5(6)carboxyfluorescein as an intracellular pH indicator. Briefly, cells grown on glass coverslips and preloaded with 2′7′-bis(carboxyethyl) 5(6)carboxyfluorescein for 20 min were perifused continuously with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium at a flow rate of 2 ml min−1 on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a × 40 oil immersion objective. The ratio of the emitted light at two excitation wave lengths (440/490 nm) was used to monitor intracellular pH, using commercially available software (Cairn Instruments, Faversham, Kent, United Kingdom) for data acquisition. Luminescence imaging of firefly luciferase provides adequate resolution at the single cell level but is not readily amenable to confocal or deconvolution methods necessary to achieve subcellular resolution (24Rutter G.A. Burnett P. Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Tavare J.M. Denton R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5489-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We therefore used the molecular approach of targeting luciferase to distinct subcellular domains by fusion with specific peptide sequences. Fig. 1 shows the constructs used in this study. Mitochondrially targeted luciferase (mLuc) was based on wild-type Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase (M r 65 kDa), extended at the amino terminus via the 26-amino acid amino-terminal signal peptide of cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII (23Rizzuto R. Nakase H. Darras B. Francke U. Fabrizi G.M. Mengel T. Walsh F. Kadenbach B. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10595-10600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This presequence is cleaved soon after mitochondrial import of the parental protein (30Pfanner N. Meijer M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R100-R103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pmLuc was generated by fusion with synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa, a neuoronal v-SNARE (11Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar) targeted to the plasma membrane and neurite extensions after palmitoylation at two amino-terminal cysteine residues (31Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These constructs targeted luciferase to the mitochondrial matrix and the plasma membrane respectively (Fig. 1), as predicted from the behavior of aequorin and green fluorescent protein targeted by identical strategies (32Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 33Marsault R. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Limited localization (< 10% of total) to a vesicular, intracellular compartment was also observed after expression of pmLuc and may represent association with secretory vesicles (34Tagaya M. Genma T. Yamamoto A. Kozaki S. Mizushima S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of recombinant expressed luciferase to [ATP] was first determined in cell extracts. These assays were performed in the presence of likely intracellular concentrations of CoA (0.01 mm) (35Liang Y. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 327-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a known regulator of enzyme activity (36Ford S.R. Buck L.M. Leach F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The presence of CoA greatly reduces the complex “flash” kinetics of the enzyme, believed to result either from the formation of the luciferyl·AMP intermediate, or the accumulation of the reaction product, oxyluciferin (37DeLuca M. Wannlund J. McElroy W.D. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), probably by enhancing the breakdown of the less stable enzyme·luciferyl·CoA intermediate (36Ford S.R. Buck L.M. Leach F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Sherf B.A. Wood K.V. Promega Notes. 1994; 49: 14-21Google Scholar). Calibration of the responses of each expressed and extracted luciferase to [ATP] indicated a similar K m for [ATP] of each construct, close to 1 mm (Fig. 2). We next demonstrated that luminescence from the expressed recombinant chimeras could be imaged in single living cells over the likely time frame of changes in intracellular [ATP]. Photon production was imaged in single luciferase-expressing MIN6 cells using an intensified and cooled charge-coupled device camera (15Rutter G.A. White M.R.H. Tavare J.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 890-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 39Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. Diabetic Med. 1997; 14: S8Google Scholar) attached to an inverted optics microscope equipped with a × 10 objective lens. In the presence of 1 mm luciferin, this technique allowed 2–5-s resolution in MIN6 cells, in which high levels of luciferase expression could be achieved, and 5-s resolution in primary β-cells (see below, Fig. 8). As observed previously (40Craig F.F. Simmonds A.C. Watmore D. McCapra F. White M.R.H. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) this concentration of luciferin was close to saturating for photon production by single cells, with little further increase in luminescence observed in the presence of 2 mm luciferin or above (data not shown). Ouabain (100 μm) caused a small increase in luminescence from cells expressing cLuc (5 ± 1%, n = 16 cells) but a more substantial increase in luminescence from cells expressing pmLuc (14 ± 1.5%, n = 15 cells) and mLuc (11.5 ± 1.5%, n = 16), as expected by the relief of ATP consumption by the plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase. It should be noted that these and smaller changes could readily be detected. Indeed, changes in luminescence in populations of 8–12 cells of as little as 3% were found to be statistically significant when integrated over a 40-s interval (results not shown). To determine the value of [ATP] in each subcompartment, we monitored the luminescence of single cells before and after permeabilization in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2). Single MIN6 cells were permeabilized with digitonin at the likely subdomain pH (7.2 for the cytosol and sub-plasma membrane region, or pH 7.8 for the mitochondrial matrix), intracellular free CoA (0.01 mm) (35Liang Y. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 327-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Mg2+(0.5 mm) (41Corkey B.E. Duszynski J. Rich T.L. Matschinsky B. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2567-2574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Rutter G.A. Osbaldeston N.J. McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Permeabilization caused a time-dependent decrease in luminescence from each construct, presumably reflecting loss of ATP from the cell cytosol or conversion of intramitochondrial ATP to ADP (for mLuc). Re-addition of ATP caused the re-appearance of luminescence after an initial small burst, as observed in extracts (Fig. 2). Comparison of the steady-state luminescence level before and after permeabilization with the obtained standard curves indicated resting [ATP] values in the low mm range in each compartment (Fig. 2). To confirm that any stimulus-induced luminescence change was due, principally, to changes in intracellular [ATP] and was unlikely to be the result of changes in the concentration of other luciferase substrates or effectors, we monitored the effects of changes in these parameters on firefly luciferase activity in vitro and in living cells. Because luciferase activity was increased in vitro by increases in pH (activity at 1 mm ATP: 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 arbitrary units at pH 6.8, 7.2, and 7.6, respectively), we first investigated whether pH changes may contribute to any observed luminescence change in response to cell stimulation. Transient intracellular alkalinization of cells with 10 mmNH4Cl increased the luminescence output from cells expressing each construct by 15–20%, whereas acidification with 10 mm Na+ acetate caused a decrease in light output by about the same amount. Under the conditions used in these studies, exposure of MIN6 cells to 30 mm glucose caused little or no change in intracellular pH (26Zhao C. Rutter G.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, 70 mm K+ caused a small (3–5%) decrease in 2′7′-bis(carboxyethyl) 5(6)carboxyfluorescein fluorescence ratio, which could be mimicked by treatment with 4 mmNa+-acetate (data not shown), likely to correspond to a pH decrease of < 0.05 pH units (43Wang X. Levi A.J. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H476-H484PubMed Google Scholar). We next tested the effects of increasing CoA concentration on extracted luciferase. In islets, Liang and Matschinsky (35Liang Y. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 327-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that increasing extracellular glucose from 2.5 to 25 mm raised islet CoA content by about 6% during a 30-min perfusion, from 6.8 pmol/μg DNA (equivalent to 6.8 μmol/liter, assuming 10 ngDNA·islet−1, and a cell volume of 2 pl) to 7.2 pmol/μg DNA. In our hands, a 500% increase in [CoA], from 10 to 50 μm, was required to increase luciferase luminescence in cell extracts by 28%. It should be noted that an increase in intracellular concentration of O2, another key luciferase substrate, is unlikely in response to elevated extracellular glucose concentrations, because these usually provoke increases in O2 consumption (44Panten U. Klein H. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 1595-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and an increased intracellular NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ ratio (see below). Finally, no changes in the luminescence were apparent in cells transfected with the non-ATP-utilizing luciferase from the sea pansy, Renilla reniformis (16Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (data not shown). As a functional assay of the correct targeting of mitochondrial luciferase in living cells, we determined whether [ATP)c and [ATP]m could be altered independently in the presence of atractyloside, a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase (10Klingenberg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1979; 4: 249-252Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, exposure to atractyloside caused a time-dependent decrease in luminescence from cells microinjected with cytosolic luciferase (Fig. 3). By contrast, in cells microinjected with cDNA encoding mitochondrial luciferase, an anti-parallel increase in the luminescence of mitochondrial luciferase was apparent. Exposure to 30 mm glucose of MIN6 cells expressing mLuc provoked a rapid, stable (for at least 10 min) increase in luminescence (Fig. 4, a and b). Blockade of Ca2+ influx slowed the apparent glucose-induced [ATP]m increase but had little or no effect on the final extent of the [ATP]m change (Fig. 4b; TableI). Furthermore, the effect of glucose could be mimicked, in part, by an increase in intracellular [Ca2+], provoked by exposure to high [K+] (Fig. 5, a and b). Unlike the stable luminescence i"

IL-2 transcription involves specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation of a purine-box transcriptional regulator operative at the antigen receptor response element (ARRE)/NF-AT target DNA sequence, and of NF-κB, AP-1, and Oct-1 (reviewed in Ref. 11Serfling E.

The T-cell immunosuppressants, CsA and FK506, inhibit transcription of the IL-2 gene through mechanisms that may involve the serine/threonine protein phosphatase, calcineurin (reviewed in Ref. 11Serfling E.

The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase and Ku have been shown to bind with sequence specificity to purine-rich target DNA sequences and to mediate sequence-specific transcriptional repression (15Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the specific CsA-sensitive purine-box/ARRE DNA binding complex in human bronchial epithelial cells involves NF45, NF90, Ku80, and Ku70 with no evidence for NF-ATp or NF-ATc proteins (16Aoki Y. Zhao G. Qiu D. Shi L. Kao P.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L1164-L1172PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of IL-2 transcription triggered through costimulatory receptors such as CD28 involves NF-κB (17Los M. Schenk H. Hexel K. Baeuerle P.A. Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3731-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and is largely resistant to inhibition by CsA (17Los M. Schenk H. Hexel K. Baeuerle P.A. Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3731-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 18June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Gillespie M.M. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4472-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The activation of transcription by NF-κB involves stimulation-induced degradation of IκB, which serves to release NF-κB p65 for translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. In the nucleus, p65 binds as a heterodimer to its target DNA sequence and then interacts with transcriptional regulatory components to signal initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Ref. 19Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4591) Google Scholar). NF-κB signaling is regulated by phosphorylation in the cytoplasm at the level of IκB in the nucleus at the level of specific DNA binding and also at the level of transcriptional activation (reviewed in Ref. 20Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We investigated the immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory properties of PG490 (pure triptolide) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, Jurkat T-cells, and human bronchial epithelial cells and show that the mechanism of inhibition by PG490 differs fundamentally from that of CsA and involves inhibition of transcriptional activation of the purine-box regulator of the ARRE/NF-AT site and of NF-κB at a step after specific binding to DNA. PG490 (triptolide, molecular weight 360) was obtained from Pharmagenesis (Palo Alto, CA). The material was composed of white to off-white crystals, had a melting point of 226–240 °C, conformed to standard triptolide preparation by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (2Kupchan S.M. Court W.A. Dailey Jr., R. Gilmore C.J. Bryan R.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 7194-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and was 97% pure by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography evaluation using acetonitrile:methanol:water (18:9:73). 4J. Fidler and R.-L. Jin, Pharmagenesis, private communication. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were prepared by centrifugation on a gradient of sodium diatrizoate/Ficoll (Sigma) of a buffy coat obtained from the Stanford Hospital blood bank. Monocytes were depleted by adherence to plastic culture dishes for 30 min at room temperature and then the PBLs were stimulated for 12 h at a density of 1 × 107cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Jurkat T-cells (clone E6–1) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). An SV-40 large T-antigen transformed human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE14o- (16HBE), which retains differentiated morphology and function of normal human airway epithelia (21Cozens A.L. Yezzi M.J. Kunzelmann K. Ohrui T. Chin L. Eng K. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Gruenert D.C. Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 10: 38-47Google Scholar), was cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker) as described (22Aoki Y. Qiu D. Uyei A. Kao P.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L272-L284Google Scholar). Human PBLs, Jurkat T-cells, or monolayer 16HBE cells were stimulated for the indicated times in culture media containing 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Calbiochem), PMA + antibody to CD3 (clone HIT3a, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), PMA + antibody to CD28 (YTH913.12, BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), PMA + 2 μm ionomycin (Iono; Calbiochem), or 20 ng/ml TNF-α (BIOSOURCE) in the presence of PG490, CsA (Sandoz), or FK506 (Fujisawa). Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern hybridization as described (22Aoki Y. Qiu D. Uyei A. Kao P.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L272-L284Google Scholar). Complementary DNA probes for human IL-2 (738 bp). IL-8 (289 bp), IκBα (883 bp), NF90 (2,008 bp), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 0.6-kilobase XbaI-HindIII fragment of cDNA) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random hexamer labeling kit (Stratagene). Jurkat T-cells were stimulated for 3 h, pelleted, and washed, and cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (12Corthesy B. Kao P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20682-20690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear proteins were extracted from chromatin using 0.3m (NH4)2SO4, and then soluble nuclear proteins were precipitated using 1.5 m(NH4)2SO4, followed by dialysis into DNA binding buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Transcription factor DNA binding activities in Jurkat T-cell nuclear extracts were assayed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). 10 μg of nuclear proteins were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in 20 μl of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1–2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 2.5 pg of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (approximately 1 × 105 cpm). The sequences of oligonucleotide probes used were agctAAAGAGGGACTTTCCCTAAA for the immunoglobulin κ light chain NF-κB site (19Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4591) Google Scholar), and aagaAAGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATA (−259 to −284 in the human IL-2 enhancer) for the purine-box/NF-AT site (11Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled by filling in overhanging ends (identified by lowercase letters) using Klenow DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and nonradioactive dGTP, dATP, and dTTP. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved from free probe using 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA (pH 8.3) and visualized by fluorography. Luciferase reporter gene constructs were under the control of the IL-2 enhancer (nucleotides −326 to +48, pCLN15deltaCX, prepared by D. Durand, Stanford University), or three copies of the purine-box/NF-AT regulatory sequence sequence (−285 to −255 of the human IL-2 enhancer) in the context of the minimal IL-2 promoter, or the immunoglobulin κ light chain NF-κB sequence monomer in the context of the minimal IL-8 promoter (−45 to +40 of the human IL-8 promoter). These plasmids also contain a neomycin resistance gene under control of the constitutively active SV40 promoter, and this allows G418 antibiotic (Life Technologies, Inc.) selection of cell lines that stably express the luciferase reporter constructs. The GAL4-luciferase reporter contains five copies of the GAL4 target DNA sequence upstream of the minimal IL-2 promoter and was prepared by J. Riegel at Stanford University. For normalizing the transient transfection assays, plasmid pEF Renilla luciferase was generated by cloning the elongation factor 1α promoter (23Uetsuki T. Naito A. Nagata S. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5791-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the pRL null vector (Promega) between theEcoRI and HindIII sites. Expression plasmids pEF CNA and pEF CNB contain the elongation factor 1α promoter (23Uetsuki T. Naito A. Nagata S. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5791-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) upstream of rat calcineurin A and calcineurin B cDNAs (24Kincaid R.L. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 96: 1170-1177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids GAL4p65TA1 and GAL4p65{TA1+TA2} utilize the Rous sarcoma virus promoter to drive expression of a chimeric protein with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) fused to the p65 transactivating domains and were generated by Schmitz and Baeuerle (25Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) and obtained through A. Baldwin (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). Jurkat T-cells were transfected by electroporation with reporter and expression plasmids as described (13Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Aoki Y. Kao P.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). T-cells were stimulated for 6–12 h (24 h after electroporation in the case of transient transfections) and then cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 10 min at 4 °C, then the cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were collected as whole cell extracts, and the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) was used to measure protein concentration. 20 μg of protein was mixed with 200 μl of luciferase reaction mixtures (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm ATP, pH 7.6, 25 mm glycylglycine, and 15 mm MgSO4) and 100 μl of 1 mm d-luciferin (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Triplicate determinations of luminescence were each read for 20 s using a MonolightTM 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory), and were measured in relative light units (RLU). In transient transfection experiments that incorporated the pEF Renilla luciferase normalizing plasmid, 20-μl aliquots of whole cell extracts were analyzed sequentially for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega), and the ratio of firefly to Renilla RLU was taken to represent the normalized (firefly) luciferase activity. Cytosolic extracts (10 μg of protein) were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% separating gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). IκBα was detected using rabbit polyclonal IgG primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:500 dilution for 2 h at 37 °C and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody at 1:3,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was with enhanced chemiluminsescence, according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Significance of the differences between the experimental conditions were determined by paired two sample Student's t test (Microsoft EXCEL). The data presented are the means ± S.D. PG490 potently inhibits IL-2 expression by human PBLs stimulated by PMA + anti-CD3 (PMA/αCD3, Fig. 1A, rows 5–8 versus row 4), and by PMA + ionomycin (Fig. 1A, rows 15–17 versus row 14). The IC50 for PG490 inhibition of PMA/αCD3-stimulated IL-2 expression is approximately 10 ng/ml (28 nm). PG490 at 200 ng/ml (560 nm) causes more complete inhibition of PMA/αCD3-stimulated IL-2 expression than CsA at 1,000 ng/ml (832 nm, Fig. 1A, row 7 versus row 11). Ionomycin stimulation alone causes minimal induction of IL-2 expression, which is inhibited by the lowest dose of 4 ng/ml PG490 (Fig. 1A, rows 12 and 13). The IC50 for PG490 inhibition of PMA/Iono-stimulated IL-2 expression is approximately 40 ng/ml (112 nm). Similar to the result in human PBLs, we show that PG490 potently inhibits Jurkat T-cell expression of IL-2 (Fig. 1B, panel a). Stimulation with PMA/Iono bypasses membrane signaling events of T-cell activation (27Weiss A. Imboden J.B. Adv. Immunol. 1987; 41: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and strongly induces IL-2 protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 1B, panels a and b, lane 6). PG490 at 20 ng/ml (56 nm) causes over 80% inhibition of PMA/Iono-stimulated IL-2 protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 1B, panel a and b, lane 7 versus lane 6). PG490 at 200 ng/ml more completely suppresses Jurkat T-cell IL-2 protein and mRNA expression stimulated by PMA and by PMA/Iono than 1,000 ng/ml of CsA (Fig. 1B, panels a and b, lanes 3and 5 versus lane 2, and lanes 8 and 10 versus lane 6). Using Northern hybridization analysis, we show that PG490 has distinct effects on the mRNA expression of cytokine regulators IκBα and NF90 (Fig. 1B, panels c and d). We observe constitutive expression of IκBα mRNA (28Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johannes A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, panel c, lane 1), and this expression is further stimulated by PMA and PMA/Iono (Fig. 1B, panel c, lanes 2 and 6). PG490 potently inhibits IκBα mRNA expression (Fig. 1B, panel c, lanes 3,4, and 7-9), whereas 1,000 ng/ml CsA shows only limited inhibition (Fig. 1B, panel c,lanes 5 and 10). In contrast, mRNA expression for NF90, a transcriptional regulator of IL-2 gene expression (13Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is significantly induced in the presence of 200 and 1,000 ng/ml PG490 (Fig. 1B, panel d, lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2 and lanes 8and 9 versus lane 6). Finally, the levels of GAPDH mRNA are unaltered in response to stimulation and drug treatment (Fig. 1B, panel e). Our observations that PG490 causes more complete inhibition of IL-2 expression than CsA and that PG490 but not CsA inhibits IκBα mRNA expression and enhances NF90 mRNA expression establish that PG490 modulates gene expression through distinctly different mechanisms than CsA. We next demonstrated that PG490 inhibits activation of an IL-2 luciferase reporter gene transfected transiently and stably into Jurkat T-cells (Fig. 2), and this result implies that PG490 inhibits IL-2 expression at the level of transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene. We used the IL-2 luciferase assay to test the ability of PG490 to inhibit the CsA-resistant pathway of T-cell activation achieved by stimulation with PMA in combination with anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (18June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Gillespie M.M. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4472-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We stimulated Jurkat T-cells that stably express the IL-2 luciferase reporter gene with either PMA + anti-CD28 antibody (PMA/αCD28), or with PMA/Iono, each in the presence of PG490 or CsA (Fig. 2A). For T-cells stimulated with PMA/Iono (Fig. 2A, left panel), the IC50 is approximately 20 ng/ml (56 nm) for PG490 and approximately 3 ng/ml (2.5 nm) for CsA inhibition of IL-2 transcription. In contrast, for T-cells stimulated with PMA/αCD28 (Fig. 2B, right panel), the IC50 is approximately 50 ng/ml for PG490 inhibition of IL-2 transcription, and CsA is completely ineffective in inhibiting this pathway of stimulation. At the two lower doses of PG490 but not of CsA, we observed modest increases in IL-2 luciferase activity before inhibition occurs at the higher doses. These results demonstrate that although CsA is more potent than PG490 in inhibiting PMA/Iono-stimulated IL-2 luciferase activity, PG490 is capable of inhibiting T-cell activation triggered through a costimulatory receptor, a situation in which CsA is ineffective. To explore further the mechanistic differences between PG490 and CsA and FK506 inhibition of IL-2 transcription, we tested the effects of calcineurin overexpression on sensitivity to inhibition by these immunosuppressant drugs (Fig. 2B) Overexpression of calcineurin in Jurkat T-cells confers relative resistance to the inhibitory effects of CsA and FK506 upon transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene (29O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 30Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). We transiently cotransfected Jurkat T-cells with the IL-2 luciferase reporter plasmid together with either an empty expression vector or with expression vectors encoding calcineurin A and B subunits (Fig. 2B). The transfected T-cells were stimulated with PMA/Iono in the presence of increasing doses of PG490 (Fig. 2B, left panel), CsA (Fig. 2B,center panel), or FK506 (Fig. 2B, right panel). There is no shift in the dose-inhibition curve of IL-2 transcription by PG490 conferred by overexpression of calcineurin (Fig. 2B, left panel). In contrast, overexpression of calcineurin shifts the IC50 for CsA inhibition of IL-2 transcription from approximately 2 to 10 ng/ml (Fig. 2B,center panel), and shifts the IC50 for FK506 inhibition of IL-2 transcription from approximately 0.2 to 1 ng/ml (Fig. 2B, right panel). These results demonstrate that PG490 inhibits IL-2 transcription through mechanisms distinct from CsA and FK506, and which probably do not involve calcineurin. After demonstrating that PG490 inhibits IL-2 expression at the level of transcription, we next investigated the effects of PG490 on the induction of DNA binding activity and transcriptional activation of specific factors controlling the purine-box/ARRE/NF-AT and NF-κB target sequences in the IL-2 enhancer (reviewed in Ref.11Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We used EMSA to analyze the effects of PG490 on the PMA/Iono-induced Jurkat T-cell purine-box/ARRE/NF-AT DNA binding activity (Fig. 3A). PG490 inhibits the induction of the purine-box/ARRE·EMSA complex with an IC50 slightly below 200 ng/ml (Fig. 3A,lane 4 versus lane 2). At 1,000 ng/ml PG490, the PMA/Iono-induced purine-box/ARRE·EMSA complex is undetectable (Fig. 3A, lane 5) and is therefore weaker than the EMSA complex constitutively present in nonstimulated cells (Fig. 3A, lane 1), and weaker than the complex induced in the presence of 1,000 ng/ml CsA (Fig. 3A,lane 6). PG490 is more potent in inhibiting PMA/Iono-stimulated transcriptional activation of a purine-box/NF-AT luciferase reporter gene with an IC50 of approximately 20 ng/ml (Fig. 3B, lane 3 versus lane 2). Taken together, these results demonstrate that PG490 inhibits both transcriptional activation and also DNA binding of the regulator operating at the purine-box/ARRE/NF-AT target sequence and that the predominant site of signaling inhibition is at the level of transcription after specific binding to DNA. We investigated the effects of PG490 on NF-κB signaling in Jurkat T-cells (Fig. 4). We show constitutive expression of the NF-κB p65 anchoring protein, IκBα, in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated Jurkat T-cells (Fig. 4A,lane 1), and IκBα expression decreases following stimulation with PMA (Fig. 4A, lane 2 versus lane 1). PG490 at 200 and 1,000 ng/ml causes nearly complete inhibition of IκBα protein expression in PMA-stimulated T-cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5), and this result correlates with PG490 inhibition of IκBα mRNA expression (Fig. 1B, panel c, lanes 3and 4). At the level of NF-κB DNA binding, stimulation of Jurkat T-cells with PMA induces the appearance of a new band (NF-κB complex, Fig. 4B, lanes 2–6). The presence of the NF-κB p65 subunit within this complex is established by the quantitative supershift of the inducible complex with an antibody to p65 (Fig. 4B, lanes 7–12). PG490 at 20 ng/ml causes no significant effect on the NF-κB·EMSA complex (Fig. 4B,lane 3 versus lane 2), and PG490 at 200 and 1,000 ng/ml causes a significant increase in the strength of the NF-κB complex (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 2 and 10,lane 11 versus lane 8). We propose that the increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity which we observe at 200 and 1,000 ng/ml PG490 occurs as a consequence of PG490 inhibition of IκBα expression, which likely allows increased nuclear translocation of p65. Despite the development of a strong NF-κB DNA binding complex in the nucleus of T-cells s"

To understand how the large subunit is translocated into the periplasm, we cloned the hyb operon encoding the hydrogenase 2 ofEscherichia coli, constructed a deletion mutant, and studied the mechanism of translocation of hydrogenase 2. The small subunit (HybO) or the large subunit (HybC) accumulated in the cytoplasm as a precursor when either of them was expressed in the absence of the other subunit. Therefore, contrary to most classical secretory proteins, the signal sequence of the small subunit itself is not sufficient for membrane targeting and translocation if the large subunit is missing. On the other hand, the small subunit was required not only for membrane targeting of the large subunit, but also for the acquisition of nickel by the large subunit. Most interestingly, the signal sequence of the small subunit determines whether the large subunit follows the Sec or the twin-arginine translocation pathway. Taken together, these results provide for the first time compelling evidence for a naturally occurring hitchhiker co-translocation mechanism in bacteria.

Taken together, these results provide for the first time compelling evidence for a naturally occurring hitchhiker co-translocation mechanism in bacteria. Proteins destined for secretion, membrane integration, or assembly into organelles are sorted with high fidelity to their respective intracellular sites by virtue of targeting signals encoded within the primary structures of the nascent polypeptides themselves. The principal role of targeting signals is to mediate the engagement of the exported protein with components of the specific translocation machinery (1Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 2Robinson C. Mant A. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 431-437Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 3Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 849-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In these cases, signal sequences are specifically recognized by a cytosolic chaperone or a targeting factor and act as true targeting signals. Alternatively, the function of signal sequences is proposed as being to delay the folding of the mature portion of an exported protein, allowing binding of an export-specific chaperone to its unfolded mature portion and thereby keeping the exported protein in a translocation-competent configuration (4Randall L.L. Topping T.B. Hardy S.J. Science. 1990; 248: 860-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Hydrogenases are omnipresent in bacteria and archaea (5Wu L.-F. Mandrand M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 10: 243-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They catalyze the reversible oxidation of hydrogen and allow bacteria to use hydrogen as an energy source for their growth. Hydrogenases can be divided into two major superfamilies: (a) nickel-iron hydrogenases (NiFe hydrogenases), and (b) iron-only hydrogenases (Fe hydrogenases). They are generally composed of a small subunit of about 30 kDa and a large subunit of 60 kDa. All small subunits of periplasmic or membrane-bound hydrogenases contain an N-terminal signal sequence possessing a conserved twin-arginine motif, which is removed once the hydrogenases are translocated into the periplasm (5Wu L.-F. Mandrand M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 10: 243-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Voordouw G. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 397-422Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The large subunits of NiFe hydrogenases show no N-terminal processing, but they possess a C-terminal extension sequence composed of one to two dozen residues. The extension sequence seems to keep the precursor of the large subunit in a conformation competent for nickel acquisition, and it is removed by a specific cytoplasmic protease upon nickel incorporation (7Binder U. Maier T. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The large subunits, therefore, are devoid of any known signal sequence required for the export of proteins. They are assumed to be co-translocated with the small subunits (5Wu L.-F. Mandrand M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 10: 243-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Voordouw G. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 397-422Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar).

HYD2 is an extrinsic membranous protein that is attached to the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane by a 5-kDa fragment of its small subunit (10Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. Eur. J.

Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Wu L.-F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The acquisition of nickel in the cytoplasm is a prerequisite for HYD2 export (11Rodrigue A. Boxer D.H. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Wu L.-F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which is mediated by the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway (12Bogsch E.

In this communication, we show that there is an interdependence between the small and the large subunits for their export and that the signal sequence of the small subunit determines the type of export pathway chosen by the large subunit. We thus provide the first example of a naturally occurring hitchhiker co-translocation of a dimeric enzyme across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane.

To construct the ΔhybOABCmutant, the 3421-base pair XhoI-BglII fragment containing hybOABC was replaced by the promoterless cassette encoding β-glucuronidase and KanR that was obtained bySalI-BglII digestion of the plasmid pUIDK2 (14Bardonnet N.

Periplasm, spheroplasts, membrane, and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared by lysozyme/EDTA/cold osmoshock and ultracentrifugation, as described previously (11Rodrigue A. Boxer D.H.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To extract peripherally bound membrane proteins, the membrane was washed with 6m urea or 100 mm sodium carbonate (pH 10). To further separate membrane proteins from aggregates, the membrane fractions were solubilized by 4% Triton X-100 in 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6) and centrifuged using an Airfuge at 30 p.s.i. for 10 min. To release HYD2 from the washed spheroplasts, limited trypsin digestion was performed as described previously (11Rodrigue A. Boxer D.H. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Wu L.-F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hydrogenase activity was measured by following the H2-linked reduction of benzyl viologen spectrophotometrically at 600 nm or by activity staining as described previously (16Wu L.-F.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4453-4460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed by using the ECL method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). To prepare antiserum against HybO, thehybO gene was cloned into pET22b+, and 6-His was added at the C terminus of the HybO. The recombinant HybO6His was solubilized by guanidine hydrochloride from inclusion bodies and partially purified on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Gel slices containing HybO6His were used in standard immunization protocols for rabbits (Eurogentec). The resulting antiserum also contains antibodies that recognize contaminating antigens. Nonspecific antibodies were removed by absorption to an acetone powder prepared with whole cells of ENF1 (ΔhybOABC) as described in Ref. 19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar. The hyb gene products were specifically labeled by [35S]methionine in vivo using T-7 RNA polymerase (20Tabor S.

Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In vitro cross-linking with formaldehyde was performed as described in Ref. 22Bouveret E. Rigal A. Lazdunski C. Bénédetti H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, with modifications. Soluble S-135 cytoplasmic fractions prepared from the strains ENF1/pHyb84 (ΔhybOABC/hyb(A-G) +) and ENF1/pHyb411 (ΔhybOABC/hybO +) were subjected, separately or as a mixture, to treatment with 0.1% formaldehyde. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and benzonase. To dissociate cross-linked complexes, samples were heated at 100 °C for 15 min, whereas the control was kept at 37 °C. All samples were treated at 90 °C for 5 min before applying them to the gel. To study the translocation mechanism, we cloned thehyb operon by using the Kohara collection (23Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Among five cosmids covering the 65 min region of the E. colichromosome, only lambda 5C10 was able to confer HYD2 activity on mutant HDJ123 that is pleiotropically defective in hydrogenase activities (Δhya, ΔhybBC, and Δhyc). A 15-kilobaseBamHI fragment containing the entire hyb operon was obtained from lambda 5C10 and cloned into pUC18, resulting in the plasmid pHyb11. A chromosomal deletion mutant in which thehybOABC genes were replaced by auidA-KanR cassette was then constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected, the resulting mutant ENF1 was deficient in HYD2 activity and was devoid of both the small (HybO) and the large (HybC) subunits (data not shown). The wild type phenotype was completely restored to mutant ENF1 by the introduction of plasmid pHyb11 harboring the entire hyboperon. In cells expressing the entire hyb operon, two forms of HybO, the small subunit of HYD2, were detected. As expected, the larger precursor form was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, lane 1), whereas the mature form, with the signal sequence removed, was recovered from the membrane fraction (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Interestingly, when it was synthesized alone, HybO accumulated as a precursor (HybO-p) in the cytoplasm and was completely absent from the membrane (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, unlike most classical secretory proteins, the signal sequence of the small subunit of HYD2 itself is not sufficient for membrane targeting and translocation. We investigated whether the large subunit (HybC) was necessary for the export of the small subunit. In the presence of a truncated HybC (see the Fig. 1 legend), the small subunit accumulated as a precursor in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, lane 5). Under these conditions, the precursor was also detected in a bona fide membrane pellet (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Further analysis, however, revealed that the pelleted precursor of the small subunit reflected aggregated material (Fig. 1A, lane 8) because it was absent from the Triton X-100-solubilized membrane fraction (Fig. 1A, lane 7). As a consequence, truncation of the large subunit resulted in the formation of aggregates of the small subunit. We previously showed that in the nik mutant, which is deficient in the specific nickel transport system, the large subunit of HYD2 accumulates as a non-processed precursor in the cytoplasm, but the addition of nickel to the growth medium restores processing of the large subunit and its membrane targeting (11Rodrigue A. Boxer D.H. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Wu L.-F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Rodrigue A. Batia N. Müller M. Fayet O. Böhm R. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Wu L.-F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4453-4460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a doubleΔnik-ΔhybOABC mutant complemented with the entirehyb operon ((hybO-G)+) and grown in the absence of nickel, the small subunit HybO was detected as HybO-p in crude extracts and the cytoplasm, but it was completely absent from the membrane (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 3, and 1, respectively). HybO-p synthesized under this condition was very labile, and a slightly smaller breakdown product of HybO was observed in this strain. The addition of nickel to the growth medium resulted in membrane targeting and maturation of the precursor of the small subunit (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6), implying a successful translocation of HybO and the removal of its signal sequence. These results indicate that a deficiency in nickel incorporation and in large subunit processing directly or indirectly affects the targeting and translocation of the small subunit of HYD2. Because the large subunits of hydrogenases are devoid of signal sequences, they are assumed to be co-translocated with the small subunits. We therefore analyzed the effect of a complete depletion ofhybO on the translocation of the large subunit using immunoblot analysis. In the presence of the small subunit, the processed form (HybC-pf) of the large subunit was detected in both the membrane and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2,lanes 2 and 4). The non-processed precursor (HybC-np) was present exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, lane 4). This result indicates that only the processed form of the large subunit is efficiently targeted to the membrane. In addition, the large subunit was successfully translocated into the periplasm because active HYD2 was released from spheroplasts by treatment with trypsin (data not shown). On the other hand, in the absence of the small subunit, the large subunit accumulated exclusively as a non-processed precursor (Fig. 2, lane 5), it was absent from the membranes (Fig. 2, lane 1), and it was totally localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, lane 3). These findings imply a failure of nickel incorporation into the large subunit, which is the normal prerequisite for its processing. Therefore, the small subunit is required not only for membrane targeting, but also for the processing of the large subunit. The interdependence between the two subunits for their translocation suggests a complex formation before export. We assessed this possibility using cross-linking and immunoblot analysis. Membrane-free S-135 fractions were prepared from spheroplasts of the mutant ENF1 (ΔhybOABC) complemented either by pHyb84 containing the hyb operon excepthybO or by pHyb411 carrying only the hybO gene. The two extracts were then treated separately or as a mixture with formaldehyde. A cross-linking product of about 100 kDa detected by antisera against the small or the large subunits was obtained only if both the small and large subunits were present in the reaction medium (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5 compared with lanes 1, 2, 7, and 8). Moreover, as expected for a formaldehyde cross-linking product, this band disappeared when samples were heated to 100 °C (Fig. 3,lanes 3 and 6). These results suggest the formation of a HybO-HybC complex under this condition, e.g.in the absence of membranes. The low amount of the HybO-HybC complex obtained correlated with the low quantity of small subunit available in the extract (lane 2); HybO present in the S-135 fraction seems to be completely converted into the complex (lane 4 versus lane 2). However, release of the small subunit from the HybO-HybC complex by heating was not detected, probably because of a degradation or aggregation of HybO due to its labile and poorly soluble nature. The authenticity of HybO was established by comparing the S-135 fraction of ENF1/pHyb411 (hybO +; lane 2) with that of ENF1/pHyb84 (hybO −; lane 1) and was independently confirmed by in vitrotranscription/translation using various plasmids (data not shown). In contrast, the 92- and 60-kDa bands are contaminating bands that are not related to HybO because they were found even in the absence of thehybO gene (Fig. 3, lane 1).Figure 5Influence of the signal sequence of HybO on the choice of export pathway used by HybC. A, crude extracts of ENF1/pHyb411 (ΔhybOABC/hybO +; lane 1), ENF1/pHyb55 (ΔhybOABC/hyb(pelBssO-G) +;lane 2), and ENF1/pHyb14 (ΔhybOABC/hyb(O-G) +; lane 3) were separated on a 12.5% SDS-gel and analyzed by immunoblot using antiserum against HybO. The precursor (HybO-p) and mature form (HybO-m) of the small subunit and the precursor of the chimera (PelBss HybO-p) are indicated on theright. B, cells containing pHyb14 (hyb(O-G) +; lanes 1 and 2) or pHyb55 (hyb(pelBssO-G) +;lanes 3–8) were grown at 30 °C to early exponential phase, shifted to 42 °C, and incubated for an additional 3 h. Thirty μg each of proteins of cytoplasmic fractions (C) and membrane fractions (M) prepared fromΔhybOABC (lanes 3 and 4),secYts-ΔhybOABC (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6), and secAts-ΔhybOABC (lanes 7 and 8) mutants were separated on a 10% SDS-gel and probed with antiserum against the small (B1) or large subunits (B2). To analyze both the small and large subunits on the same gel, a compromised concentration (10%) of polyacrylamide was used. This concentration is not appropriated for visualizing the tiny migration difference between HybO-m and PelBssHybO-p, as observed on a 12.5% gel in A. The small (HybO) or large (HybC) subunits and the nonspecific band are indicated on theright. C, crude extracts prepared fromsecYts (lane 1), wild type strain without plasmid (lane 2), or complemented by pHyb14 (lane 3) or pHyb55 (lane 4) grown at 30 °C were separated on 13% SDS-gels and analyzed by immunoblotting using antisera to MalE. The precursor (MalE-p) and processed MalE (MalE-m) are indicated on the right. D, membrane fractions were prepared from ΔhybOABC (lanes 1, 4, and 7), secYts-ΔhybOABC (lanes 2, 5, and 8), and secAts-ΔhybOABC (lanes 3, 6,and 9) complemented by pHyb55. Urea-extracted fractions (lanes 1–3), Triton X-100-solubilized membranes (T-X100; lanes 4–6), and insoluble fractions (lanes 7–9) were separated on a 7.5% SDS-gel and analyzed by immunoblot using antiserum against the large subunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Tat pathway, which is required for the translocation of proteins carrying a signal sequence with an essential twin-arginine motif, has been recently identified in E. coli (12Bogsch E.

Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We previously reported that one of the substrates of the Tat pathway, the periplasmic trimethylamine N-oxyde reductase, is exported independently of the Sec machinery (18Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.-F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The above results indicating a co-translocation of the large and the small subunit of HYD2 are inconsistent with a passage of HYD2 through the Sec machinery, which is believed to accommodate single, unfolded polypeptides. Indeed, the large subunits of HYD2 were found mainly in the membrane fraction of asecY mutant (Fig. 4,lanes 5 and 6), and HybC was released from spheroplasts by limited trypsin digestion (lane 8), indicating a normal translocation of HYD2 across the cytoplasmic membrane of the secY mutant. The correct phenotype of thesecYcs mutant used was confirmed by the accumulation of the precursor of MalE (lane 2). On the contrary, HybC accumulated in the cytoplasm of the tatC mutant (lanes 3 and 4), and it was not accessible from the spheroplasts (lane 7), which confirms the previous observation that translocation of Hyd2 is dependent on components of the Tat pathway (12Bogsch E. Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18003-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 13Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The twin-arginine signal sequence of the small subunit is likely to be the determinant for directing HybC to the Tat apparatus. To address this point, we substituted the first 27 N-terminal residues of HybO, including the twin-arginine motif, with the 22 residues of the typical Sec-dependent signal sequence of PelB. The resulting plasmid, pHyb55, directed the biosynthesis of the chimeraPelBssHybO, which accumulated as a 39-kDa precursor and ran between the precursor and mature form of HybO (Fig. 5A). Under this condition, the chimera and the large subunit were found mainly in the membrane fractions (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4). However, they were absent from either the periplasm or the trypsin-solubilized fraction (data not shown), suggesting that they are targeted to but not translocated across the membrane. Nevertheless, the large subunit was tightly bound to the membrane (see below). It seems likely that the chimera forms a PelBssHybO-HybC complex that is targeted by virtue of the PelB signal sequence to the translocase SecYEG, and it would then become stuck in the translocation channel. This assumption was confirmed by the following observations. First, the doubling time during the growth of MC4100/pHyb55, which synthesizes thePelBssHybO-HybC complex, increased by 50% compared with that for MC4100/pHyb14 in which HybO is synthesized with its native twin-arginine signal sequence. Second, the precursor of MalE accumulated in MC4100/pHyb55 (Fig. 5C, lane 4) to the same extent as in the secY mutant (lane 1), but it was absent from MC4100/pHyb14 (lane 3). Therefore, the jamming of the Sec translocon by the PelBssHybO-HybC complex resulted in an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth and led to the accumulation of a precursor of a Sec substrate. Finally, in contrast to the native HybO-HybC complex that is located exclusively in the membrane of the secY mutant (Fig. 5, B1 and B2, lanes 1 and 2), targeting of the chimeric PelBssHybO-HybC complex was clearly affected bysec mutations. Thus, the large subunit HybC accumulated mainly in the cytoplasms of both secY and secA(Fig. 5B2, lanes 5 and 7), whereas the amount ofPelBssHybO detected in these mutants was strongly reduced (Fig. 5B1, lanes 5–8), presumably due to a degradation of misfolded or non-protected material. The remainder of HybC found to co-sediment with membranes (lanes 6 and 8) was further analyzed as to the nature of its membrane association. HybC co-expressed with PelBssHybO was completely removed fromsecA membranes by 6 m urea (Fig. 5D, lane 3), whereas no HybC was extracted from the membranes of the wild type strain and the secY mutant (Fig. 5D, lanes 1and 2). A second extraction of these membranes with sodium carbonate did not further remove HybC (data not shown). When the extracted membranes were treated with Triton X-100, only HybC in the wild type strain was solubilized (Fig. 5D, lane 4), whereas that in the secY mutant remained in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 5D, lane 8). Thus, in the presence ofPelBssHybO, most HybC looses its membrane association upon inactivation of SecY and SecA, with residual sedimenting material being only loosely attached or aggregated. The combined results therefore indicate that HybC in a PelBssHybO-HybC complex is targeted to the membrane by the Sec machinery recognizing the PelB signal sequence of the chimeric small subunit. These findings strongly support the idea that HybO and HybC form a complex before translocation and that HybC is targeted to the membrane via a hitchhiker mechanism. Most extracytoplasmic proteins are synthesized with a signal sequence that targets them for export. Removal of the signal sequence or mutations in the signal sequence considerably decrease the efficiency of protein export. However, it has been reported that polypeptides lacking a signal sequence can be effectively imported into the peroxisomal matrix in a piggyback fashion on other polypeptides containing signal sequences (27Rachubinski R.A. Subramani S. Cell. 1995; 83: 525-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Bacterial hydrogenases are composed of small subunits with the twin-arginine signal sequence and large subunits devoid of any export signal. A naturally occurring co-translocation between the subunits has been proposed (5Wu L.-F. Mandrand M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 10: 243-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Voordouw G. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 397-422Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this study, we observe an interdependence between the small and the large subunits for the translocation of HYD2 across the cytoplasmic membrane. Most importantly, we show that the signal sequence of the small subunit determines the export pathway followed by the large subunit. We considered two models consistent with a hitchhiker co-translocation mechanism. According to the first model, membrane targeting of the two subunits of HYD2 is a sequential event. The precursor of the small subunit is targeted alone to the membrane with the help of its signal sequence. The incorporation of nickel into the large subunit leads to the removal of its C-terminal extension sequence and results in a conformational change, which allow the processed large subunit to specifically interact with the membrane-bound small subunit. This interaction triggers the membrane insertion of the large subunit and the formation of the complex, which then crosses the membrane by an unknown mechanism. According to the second model, the small and the large subunits of HYD2 first form a complex, which is followed by processing of the large subunit and then by membrane targeting of the complex by virtue of the signal sequence of the small subunit. Our findings are more in favor of the second model. When the small subunit was expressed alone, it accumulated in the cytoplasm as a precursor. In addition, membrane targeting of the small subunit required not only the presence of the large subunit but also nickel incorporation into the large subunit and processing of the large subunit. Reciprocally, depletion of the small subunit prevented the large subunit from being targeted to the membrane and affected the incorporation of nickel into the large subunit and its processing. In addition, the substitution of the twin-arginine signal sequence of the small subunit with a Sec-dependent signal sequence inhibited nickel acquisition and processing of the large subunit (data not shown). Because the acquisition of nickel by the large subunit occurs in the cytoplasm and is a prerequisite for HYD2 translocation (11Rodrigue A. Boxer D.H. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Wu L.-F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the interdependence implies a direct contact between the subunits and strongly suggests the formation of a complex before translocation. Consistently, we observed that HybO and HybC can form a complex in vitro in the absence of membranes. Taken together, our results show that the bacterial Tat pathway is capable of translocating oligomeric complex across the cytoplasmic membrane in a piggyback fashion, and thus it shares mechanistic similarities with the pathway used in protein import into the peroxisomes, in addition to the characteristics common to the Sec-independent, ΔpH-driven import pathway of plant thylakoids.

Here we report that synthetic peptides corresponding to the BH3 domain of Bak bind to Bcl-xL, antagonize its anti-apoptotic function, and rapidly induce apoptosis when delivered into intact cells via fusion to the Antennapedia homeoprotein internalization domain. Treatment of HeLa cells with the Antennapedia-BH3 fusion peptide resulted in peptide internalization and induction of apoptosis within 2–3 h, as indicated by caspase activation and subsequent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, as well as morphological characteristics of apoptosis. A point mutation within the BH3 peptide that blocks its ability to bind to Bcl-xL abolished its apoptotic activity, suggesting that interaction of the BH3 peptide with Bcl-2-related death suppressors, such as Bcl-xL, may be critical for its activity in cells. While overexpression of Bcl-xL can block BH3-induced apoptosis, treatment with BH3 peptides resensitized Bcl-xL-expressing cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. BH3-induced apoptosis was blocked by caspase inhibitors, demonstrating a dependence on caspase activation, but was not accompanied by a dramatic early loss of mitochondrial membrane potential or detectable translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol.

The Bcl-2 protein family plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis in evolutionarily diverse species (1Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Certain family members, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, act as potent suppressors of apoptosis, whereas other homologs (e.g. Bak and Bax) have opposing functions and promote cell death. Although the mechanistic details by which these proteins function to regulate apoptosis are still unclear, certain domains of homology between family members, termed Bcl-2 homology (BH) 1The abbreviation used is: BH, Bcl-2 homology; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PARP, poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; SF, serum-free; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential. domains, are critical for various aspects of their activities, including the induction or suppression of cell death, and the ability to heterodimerize with other family members (2Yin X.-M.

In support of this possibility, Bad, a “BH3-only” member of the Bcl-2 family, appears to promote apoptosis by forming inactivating dimers with death suppressors through its BH3 domain (13Kelekar A. Chang B.S. Harlan J.E. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7040-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined whether synthetic BH3 peptides can function as antagonists of Bcl-xL, and have assessed their biological activity when introduced into intact cells. A Bak BH3 peptide was found to antagonize the protective effects of microinjected Bcl-xL in α-Fas-treated HeLa cells, whereas a mutant Bak BH3 peptide that no longer binds Bcl-xL was inactive. Delivery of synthetic BH3 peptides into the cytosol of intact HeLa cells via facilitated diffusion as a fusion with the internalization domain of the Antennapedia homeoprotein, resulted in the induction of a caspase-dependent apoptotic program, characterized by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and morphological changes such as cytoplasmic contraction, membrane blebbing, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. This BH3-mediated cell death was not, however, accompanied by an early loss of mitochondrial membrane potential or release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, suggesting the engagement of a cytochrome c-independent pathway to caspase activation. In addition, the Antennapedia-BH3 fusion peptide (Ant-BH3) was able to overcome the protective effects of Bcl-xL in α-Fas-treated HeLa cells. Our results demonstrate that the Bak BH3 domain is sufficient to antagonize the function of Bcl-xL and to trigger the apoptotic program in intact cells. HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm l-glutamine (complete DMEM) at 37 °C with 6% CO2. Cells were maintained in constant logarithmic growth in plastic culture dishes (Costar) for less than 15 passages. Peptides were synthesized by a commercial vendor utilizing diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxy-benzotriazole-activated Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-protected amino acids (Genzyme-Sygena, Cambridge, MA) on a model 396 Multiple Peptide Synthesizer (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, KY) and purified on Poros R2/M 16 × 100-mm prep columns (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) with a gradient of 0–80% solvent B over 40 column volumes (solvent A = H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B = CH3CN/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Confirmation of molecular weight was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Peptides were resuspended in Me2SO at 5 or 10 mm, and stored at −20 °C. HeLa cells were plated in complete DMEM in 60-mm dishes at 2.4 × 105 cells/dish. Mixtures containing peptides and proteins as indicated in 25 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.2, containing 3.3 mm NaCl and 1 mg/ml FITC-dextran as a marker were filter-sterilized and injected into the cytoplasm of cells using an Eppendorf micromanipulator and microinjector with femtotip capillary microtips. Following injection, the cells were returned to the incubator, and after 1 h the number of injected cells was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were then treated with α-Fas mAb (7C11) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), and the recovery of injected cells remaining after 18 h was determined. Biotinylated control or fusion peptides were added to cells grown on glass coverslips in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine (SF-DMEM). After a 30-min incubation with the peptides, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After two additional washes with PBS, cells were incubated in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with streptavidin-FITC at 2 μg/ml in blocking buffer. Coverslips were washed three times and mounted in aqueous mounting medium (polyvinyl alcohol) on glass microscope slides for fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Microphot-FXA upright fluorescence microscope. Cells were plated in complete DMEM in 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar) at 4 × 103/well. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and treated with peptides (50 μm) in SF-DMEM. Cell viability was determined by staining unfixed cells with calcein AM/ethidium homodimer (Molecular Probes), followed by microscopic analysis of cell staining and cellular morphology on a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope equipped with a fluorescence module. HeLa cells were plated in 24-well plates at 2.5 × 104/well 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) with a plasmid encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker. Each well was transfected with 0.1 μg of pcDNA3-GFP plasmid and 1.0 μg of either pcDNA-3 or pcDNA3-Bcl-xL plasmids. Following transfection, cells were incubated overnight in complete DMEM and subjected to peptide or α-Fas mAb treatment as described above. Cells were treated with Antennapedia fusion peptides in SF-DMEM or with α-Fas mAb (7C11) in complete DMEM for various times and scraped directly into 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (with 6 m urea added). Lysates were sonicated briefly (20 s, 40% duty cycle) and loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and PARP was detected by Western blotting using the murine α-PARP mAb (C-2–10, Biomol) at a 1:5000 dilution with ECL-based detection using a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were determined by staining cells with the indicator dye 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′- tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1). JC-1 was added directly to the cell culture medium (1 μm final concentration) and incubated for 15 min. The medium was then replaced with PBS, and the cells were either photographed or quantitated for J-aggregate fluorescence intensity on a fluorescence plate reader using excitation and emission filters of 492 and 590 nm, respectively. HeLa cells (1 × 106 cells) were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated overnight prior to treatment with various inducers of apoptosis. At various time points, cells were trypsinized, washed once with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer with a tight pestle. Cytosolic fractions were isolated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a tabletop microcentrifuge, and membrane fractions including mitochondria were resuspended in a volume of lysis buffer equal to the volume of cytosol obtained to normalize the number of cells represented in each fraction. Fractions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and analyzed for cytochrome ccontent by Western blot analysis using a mouse α-cytochromec monoclonal antibody (7H8.2C12) and an enhanced chemiluminescent-based detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were also probed with antibodies specific for actin (AC-40) and the mitochondrial membrane protein VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel) (anti-porin 31HL) as fractionation markers. Synthetic BH3 peptides can bind to Bcl-2-like death suppressors and block heterodimerization with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologues in vitro (3Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E.

Chittenden, and R. J. Lutz, unpublished results. To test the ability of a BH3 peptide to antagonize the protective function of a death suppressor, Bcl-xL was delivered into the cytosol of cells by microinjection either in the presence or absence of a Bak BH3 peptide. Microinjection of a bacterially expressed GST-Bcl-xL fusion protein, but not GST alone, efficiently protected HeLa cells from death induced by Fas ligation in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 1). Co-injection of a 15-amino acid Bak BH3 peptide (BH3) greatly attenuated the protective effect of Bcl-xL in this assay. A mutant Bak BH3 peptide (BH3-A78), in which an alanine has been substituted for a leucine at position 78 (numbered according to full-length Bak), did not block Bcl-xL-mediated protection from Fas-induced death. Thus, the ability of these peptides to inhibit the function of Bcl-xL correlated with their ability to bind to Bcl-xL (3Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M.

Under these conditions, neither peptide had an effect on cell viability in the absence of α-Fas treatment (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with MRC5 human diploid fibroblasts where protection from Fas-induced death by microinjected Bcl-xL was inhibited by co-injection of the wild-type, but not mutant, Bak BH3 peptide (data not shown). These results suggest that Bak BH3 peptides bind to Bcl-xL and interfere with its anti-apoptotic function. To further investigate the activity of this domain in cells, BH3 peptides were synthesized as fusions with the internalization sequence from the Antennapedia (Ant) protein (TableI). Similar Ant fusion peptides have been shown to be internalized into cells in culture and elicit peptide-specific biological responses (15Theodore L. Derossi D. Chassaing G. Llirbat B. Kubes M.

To determine whether the Ant-BH3 peptide could be internalized, HeLa cells were treated with biotin-tagged versions of the peptides, and peptide uptake was monitored by staining with streptavidin-FITC. While untreated cells or cells treated with non-biotinylated peptides did not stain with streptavidin-FITC (data not shown), cells treated with biotinylated Ant fusion peptides were highly positive within 30 min of addition of peptides to the culture medium (Fig. 2), indicating efficient internalization of the peptides. A biotinylated BH3 peptide lacking the Ant internalization sequence was not internalized.Table IList of peptidesPeptideInternalization sequenceBak BH3 sequenceAntRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKAnt-BH3RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK–MGQVGRQLAIIGDDINRRYAnt-BH3-A78RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK–MGQVGRQAAIIGDDINRRYBH3MGQVGRQLAIIGDDINRRY Open table in a new tab In contrast to the lack of cytotoxicity when BH3 peptides were delivered as a single bolus dose by microinjection, treatment of HeLa cells with the Ant-BH3 peptide, which allows for the delivery of a sustained pool of BH3 peptide, resulted in a dramatic loss of cell viability within 6 h (Fig. 3, C and D). Changes in cell morphology characteristic of apoptosis, including reduction in cell volume, nuclear condensation, and membrane blebbing, were observed as early as 2–3 h following the addition of the fusion peptide. Treatment of cells with peptides comprising just the BH3 domain (Fig. 3D) or the internalization sequence alone (Ant) (Fig. 3D) had no effect on cell morphology or viability, demonstrating that the observed cell killing activity was BH3-dependent and required internalization. Furthermore, the mutant Ant-BH3 peptide (Ant-BH3-A78), which is defective in binding to Bcl-xL (3Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar), did not exhibit significant cell killing activity (Fig. 3, B and D). This underscores the importance of an intact BH3 sequence for the BH3 peptide's cytotoxic effects and implicates a mechanism involving an interaction with a specific intracellular target, presumably one (or more) of the Bcl-xL-like death suppressors. In consideration of the possible involvement of a Bcl-xL-like death suppressor in BH3-induced apoptosis, we sought to determine the effects of Bcl-xL overexpression on the pro-apoptotic activity of BH3 peptides. HeLa cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing Bcl-xL and GFP as a marker. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were treated with the Ant-BH3 peptide for an additional 6 h. GFP-expressing cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy and scored as either live or dead based on their morphology. Overexpression of Bcl-xL blocked the cell killing activity of the Ant-BH3 peptide in this assay (Fig. 4). Non-transfected cells in the same well (cells not expressing GFP) were not protected and underwent morphological changes similar to control cells when treated with Ant-BH3 (data not shown). Bcl-xL-expressing cells were also protected from α-Fas-induced death. However, treatment with the wild type Ant-BH3 peptide, but not the loss-of-binding mutant Ant-BH3-A78, resensitized the Bcl-xL-expressing cells to the induction of apoptosis by α-Fas. These findings suggest that interaction with a death suppressor such as Bcl-xL may be an important aspect of the activity of the BH3 domain and its ability to influence a cell's susceptibility to undergo apoptosis. In addition to well described morphological hallmarks, the induction of apoptosis is often accompanied by the activation of the ICE/Ced-3 family of cysteine proteases, or caspases (22Salvesen G.S.

Western blots of lysates prepared from HeLa cells undergoing BH3-induced apoptosis revealed detectable PARP cleavage within 2 h of peptide treatment, based on the appearance of a characteristic 85-kDa breakdown product (Fig. 5A). By 4 h, a substantial portion of PARP had been cleaved. Neither the Ant control peptide nor the Ant-BH3-A78 mutant peptide caused detectable PARP cleavage, even after 6 h. Interestingly, the time course for BH3-induced caspase activation as measured by PARP cleavage was similar to that observed upon Fas ligation in these cells, suggesting that BH3-induced apoptosis results from rapid activation of caspases similar to the Fas-related pathway, which involves recruitment and activation of caspases directly at the Fas receptor. In contrast, induction of PARP cleavage by treatment of HeLa cells with the topoisomerase inhibitor, etoposide, does not occur until well over 6 h. To determine whether the BH3-dependent activation of caspases is required for induction of cell death by Ant-BH3 peptide, the effect of caspase inhibitors on BH3-induced death was tested. Treatment of cells with the broad spectrum tripeptide caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (80 μm) (25Nicholson D.W. Ambereen A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R.

The inhibition of BH3-induced death correlated with a lack of PARP cleavage in the presence of z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 5C). The tetrapeptide inhibitor DEVD-fmk also completely blocked BH3-induced apoptosis while YVAD-fmk was somewhat less effective. These data indicate that the induction of cell death by the Ant-BH3 peptide is dependent on caspase activation. It has recently become evident that the mitochondria may play an important role in apoptotic signaling (28Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by a wide variety of stimuli is preceded by a release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial matrix into the cytosol, where it has been proposed to be involved in the activation of caspases (29Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar, 30Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). In addition, mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) are events that are common to many pathways of apoptosis induction. While several members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, are located primarily in the outer mitochondrial membrane, the specific involvement of these proteins in the mitochondrial events associated with apoptosis remains unclear. To analyze mitochondrial events that may be associated with BH3-induced apoptosis, the potential-sensitive fluorescent probe JC-1 (32Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 33Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) was used to detect loss of ΔΨm at 5 h after exposure of cells to various apoptotic stimuli. In untreated cells (Fig. 6A) or cells treated with the inactive Ant-BH3-A78 peptide (Fig. 6E), JC-1 formed the characteristic J-aggregates in the mitochondria which emit photons at 585 nm (orange-red), demonstrating that the mitochondrial membrane potential is intact. Treatment of cells with the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone, a potent uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, causes a rapid loss of membrane potential. Under these conditions, the JC-1 probe failed to aggregate and little or no red fluorescence was observed (Fig. 6B). Etoposide treatment also resulted in a complete loss of ΔΨm at 5 h, indicated by the absence of J-aggregates (Fig. 6D), which preceded caspase activation (see Fig. 5A) and changes in cell morphology. In contrast, no significant loss of ΔΨm was observed during the induction of apoptosis by Ant-BH3 peptide (Fig. 6F) or Fas ligation (Fig. 6C) at 5 h, even after substantial changes in cell morphology (as in Fig. 3) and cleavage of PARP had occurred (Fig. 5A). Fig. 7A shows a quantitative measurement of JC-1 staining obtained on a fluorescence plate reader 3 h after induction of cell death. As expected, both etoposide and staurosporine caused an early (3 h) loss of ΔΨm, which preceded or coincided, respectively, with caspase activation (Fig. 7B), whereas the mitochondrial membrane potential was still unchanged in Ant-BH3-treated cells even after caspases had been activated. The results of these experiments suggest that depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane is likely not required for the induction of apoptosis by the BH3 domain in intact cells. In keeping with these results, treatment of cells with cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of the membrane permeability transition and subsequent loss of ΔΨm (34Broekemeier K.M. Dempsey M.E. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7826-7830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not appear to suppress BH3-induced death. 3E. P.

The peptide GS14, cyclo(VKLKVd-YPLKVKLd-YP), designed on the basis of gramicidin S (GS), exists in a preformed highly amphipathic β-sheet conformation and was used as the base compound for this study. Fourteen diastereomers of GS14 were synthesized; each contained a different single enantiomeric substitution within the framework of GS14. The β-sheet structure of all GS14 diastereomers was disrupted as determined by CD and NMR spectroscopy under aqueous conditions; however, all diastereomers exhibited differential structure inducibility in hydrophobic environments. Because the diastereomers all have the same composition, sequence, and intrinsic hydrophobicity, the amphipathicity of the diastereomers could be ranked based upon retention time from reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. There was a clear correlation showing that high amphipathicity resulted in high hemolytic activity and low antimicrobial activity in the diastereomers. The latter may be the result of increased affinity of highly amphipathic peptides to outer membrane components of Gram-negative microorganisms. The diastereomers possessing the most favorable therapeutic indices possessed some of the lowest amphipathicities, although there was a threshold value below which antimicrobial activity decreased. The best diastereomer exhibited 130-fold less hemolytic activity compared with GS14, as well as greatly increased antimicrobial activities, resulting in improvement in therapeutic indices of between 1,000- and 10,000-fold for a number of microorganisms. The therapeutic indices of this peptide were between 16- and 32-fold greater than GS for Gram-negative microorganisms and represents a significant improvement in specificity over GS. Our findings show that a highly amphipathic nature is not desirable in the design of constrained cyclic antimicrobial peptides and that an optimum amphipathicity can be defined by systematic enantiomeric substitutions.

Our findings show that a highly amphipathic nature is not desirable in the design of constrained cyclic antimicrobial peptides and that an optimum amphipathicity can be defined by systematic enantiomeric substitutions. The ever-increasing development of bacterial resistance to traditional antibiotics has reached alarming levels, making it essential that new antibiotics be developed (1Travis J. Science. 1994; 264: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Ideally, these new antibiotics should possess both novel modes of action as well as different cellular targets compared with existing antibiotics to decrease the likelihood of development of cross-resistance. Antimicrobial peptides may represent such a new class of antibiotics, and their design and structure-activity relationships have become an area of active research in recent years (see Refs. 2Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar and 3Hancock R.E.W. Lehrer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar and references therein). Although their exact mode of action has not been established, it has been proposed that the cytoplasmic membrane is the main target of these peptides, where their accumulation results in increased permeability and loss of barrier function. The development of resistance to these membrane active peptides is not expected because this would require substantial changes in the lipid composition of cell membranes. Indeed, the induction of resistance to such peptides has not been seen for a number of the antimicrobial peptides (2Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Because both their mode of action and cellular targets are different from those of the traditional antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides represent a truly new class of antibiotics and are therefore attractive candidates for development as such. Two major classes of the cationic antimicrobial peptides are the α-helical and the β-sheet peptides. The α-helical class (for example cecropins, magainins, and melittin) are linear peptides that exist as disordered structures in aqueous media and become helical upon interaction with hydrophobic solvents or phospholipid vesicles. Unlike the α-helical peptides, β-sheet peptides are cyclic peptides constrained in this conformation either by disulfide bonds (tachyplesins, protegrins, and polyphemeusins) or by cyclization of the backbone (gramicidin S and tyrocidines). Although the β-sheet conformations of these peptides may be further stabilized in the presence of a hydrophobic or lipid environment, they exist largely in a “preformed” β-sheet conformation in aqueous environments due to their structural constraints. From numerous structure-activity studies on both natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides, a number of factors believed to be important for antimicrobial activitiy have been identified. These include the presence of both hydrophobic and basic residues, as well as a defined secondary structure (α-helical or β-sheet), either preformed or inducible, and an amphipathic nature that segregates basic and hydrophobic residues to opposite sides of the molecule in lipid or lipid-mimicking environments (2Hancock R.E.W.

Many of the antimicrobial peptides show poor selectivity for bacteria in that they are also toxic to higher eukaryotic cells. To make the antimicrobial peptides useful as therapeutics therefore requires delineation of the features responsible for antimicrobial activity from those responsible for toxicity to higher eukaryotic cells (typically measured as hemolytic activity). The obvious goal is to design peptides that have high antimicrobial activity coupled with low toxicity,i.e. a high specificity or high therapeutic index. Recent studies on a number of linear peptides have attempted to delineate features responsible for these activities and found that high amphipathicity (6Dathe M. Wieprecht T. Nikolenko H. Handel L.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1826-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) were correlated with increased hemolytic activity. Antimicrobial activity on the other hand was found to be less dependent on peptide helicity (9Shai Y. Oren Z. J. Biol.

Furthermore, decreases in either hydrophobicity or amphipathicity were either found to increase (7Blondelle S.E. Houghten R.A.

In both cases, however, specificity for bacteria over erythrocytes could be increased either by increasing activity coupled with decreased hemolysis (7Blondelle S.E. Houghten R.A.

Relatively few studies have investigated structural features responsible for the hemolytic and antimicrobial properties of the cyclic β-sheet peptides. The fact that these peptides are constrained and therefore have less conformational freedom compared with the linear α-helical peptides suggests that the properties of these peptides may be different. We have utilized the 10 residue head-to-tail cyclic peptide gramicidin S (GS) 1The abbreviation used is: GS, gramicidin S; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; NPN, 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; TFE, trifluoroethanol; dansyl, 5-dimethylamino- naphthalene-1-sulfonyl. (12Gause G.F. Brazhnikova M.G. Nature. 1944; 154: 703Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar) as the basis of our design for novel antimicrobial agents. GS has the sequence cyclo(Val-Orn-Leu-d-Phe-Pro)2 and exists in an antiparallel β-sheet conformation with the strands fixed in place by two type II′ β-turns (5Izumiya N. Kato T. Aoyaga H. Waki M.

The β-sheet structure gives the molecule a preformed amphipathic nature with four hydrophobic residues (Val and Leu) making up one face of the molecule and two basic Orn residues making up the other face. This amphipathicity, along with high hydrophobicity, has long been thought to be important for the antimicrobial properties of GS-like peptides (5Izumiya N. Kato T. Aoyaga H. Waki M. Kondo M.

A previous study with cyclic β-sheet antimicrobial peptides based on GS indicated that it is possible to dissociate antimicrobial and hemolytic activities through gross manipulation of β-sheet structure and amphipathicity (19Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Kay C.M. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25261-25268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this manuscript, we report on the effect of small incremental changes in amphipathicity (directed hydrophobicity and positive charge) on the antimicrobial and hemolytic properties of cyclic 14 residue peptides. We have utilized the cyclic tetradecapeptide, GS14, cyclo(VKLKVd-YPLKVKLd-YP), as the model peptide in this study. This peptide has been shown to exist in a highly amphipathic β-sheet structure, with six hydrophobic residues on one face of the molecule and four basic residues on the opposite face (19Kondejewski L.H.

Gronwald W. Nip A.M. Hodges R.S. Wishart D.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unlike GS, which exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial activity as well as hemolytic activity, GS14 was found to possess limited antimicrobial activity and very high hemolytic activity (19Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Kay C.M. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25261-25268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because amphipathicity is intimately linked to β-sheet structure in GS14, any change in β-sheet structure was predicted to directly affect the amphipathicity of the molecule. We have created a series of GS14 diastereomers in which each contains a different single residue enantiomeric substitution within the framework of GS14 resulting in a series of cyclic peptides possessing gradated disruption of β-sheet structure and amphipathicity. The present method of enantiomeric substitutions within a constrained backbone system has the advantage that all peptides retain the same sequence, intrinsic hydrophobicity, and basicity but differ only in structure. We show that the amphipathicity of these peptides has a large effect on their biological properties and that by defining the optimum amphipathicity in the framework of these cyclic peptides, the balance between hemolytic and antimicrobial activities can be optimized. All peptides were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis using standard t-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry, cleaved from the resin, and purified by preparative RP-HPLC as reported previously (19Kondejewski L.H.

For all peptides proline was the C terminus because racemization can occur during the cyclization reaction with other residues. 2L. H. Kondejewski and R. S. Hodges, unpublished results. Purity of linear peptides was verified by analytical RP-HPLC, and correct peptide masses were verified by electrospray mass spectrometry on a Fisons VG Quattro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Manchester, UK). Pure linear side chain protected peptides were cyclized, deprotected, and purified by preparative RP-HPLC as described (19Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Kay C.M. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S.

Purified cyclic peptides were homogeneous by analytical RP-HPLC and gave correct primary ion molecular weights by mass spectrometry as well as appropriate amino acid analysis ratios. Peptide concentrations of stock solutions were determined by amino acid analysis for subsequent use in biological assays. Peptides were analyzed by RP-HPLC on a Zorbax SB-C8 column (150 × 2.1-mm inner diameter, 5 μm particle size, 300 Å pore size; Rockland Technologies, Wilmington, DE) using a Hewlett Packard 1100 chromatograph at 70 °C with a linear AB gradient of 1% B/min (where solvent A was 0.5% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B was 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) as described (19Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Kay C.M. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. J. Biol.

Spectra were recorded in either 5 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, or 5 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE). NMR spectroscopy was carried out under aqueous conditions on a Varian Unity 300 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm inverse detection probe. Each peptide was dissolved in 500 μl of 90% H2O/10% D2O (or 100% D2O) giving a sample conentration of 1–2 mm, and the pH was adjusted to 5.5. 1H double quantum filtered two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy, rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy, and total correlation spectroscopy spectra were collected at 25 °C and processed as described (21Wishart D.S. Kondejewski L.H. Semchuk P.D. Sykes B.D. Hodges R.S. Letters Peptide Sci. 1996; 3: 53-60Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The chemical shift index was calculated for selected peptides as described by Wishart et al. (22Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar). A model of GS14 was constructed using Insight II (Biosym Technologies Inc., San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics workstation starting with the linear peptide LKVd-YPLKVKLd-YPVK. The model was constructed by specifying standard antiparallel β-sheet φ, ψ values of −139 ° and +135 °, respectively (23Creighton T.E. Proteins. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1984: 171-237Google Scholar). Two type II′ β-turns were incorporated into the model designating d-Tyr and Pro residues as residues i + 1 and i + 2 of the turns. Dihedral angles (φ, ψ) used for the turns were 60 °, −120 ° and −80 °, 0 ° for i + 1 and i + 2 residues, respectively (23Creighton T.E. Proteins. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1984: 171-237Google Scholar). The formation of the turns brought the N and C termini into close proximity, and an amide bond was formed between the termini. The model was subjected to energy minimization using the consistent valence force field (24Dauber-Ogusthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Ogusthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12688-12694Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) was calculated using the consensus hydrophobicity scale of Eisenberg et al. (25Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar) to facilitate comparison with other antimicrobial peptides. Due to the cyclic nature of GS14, calculation of μ was carried out for each half of the molecule, and the value reported represented the average of these values. This procedure was necessary to account for the two β-turns in the molecule and appears to be a reasonable assumption based on the molecular model. The two segments used for the calculations were: VKLKVYP and LKVKLYP; a value of δ = 180 ° was used for the angle at which successive side chains emerge from the backbone of the β-sheet. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured using a standard microtitre dilution method in Luria Broth no salt medium utilizing the same bacterial strains as reported (19Kondejewski L.H.

MICs were determined as the lowest peptide concentration that inhibited growth after 24 h at 37 °C. The hemolytic activity of peptides was measured in saline utilizing human erythrocytes as described (16Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. Int. J.

The concentration of peptide required for complete hemolysis was determined visually after 24 h at 37 °C. Dansyl-polymyxin B displacement fromPseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was measured to determine the binding affinity of the peptides to LPS (19Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S.

Permeabilization of bacterial outer membranes was measured by monitoring peptide mediated 1-N-phenylnaphthalamine (NPN) fluorescence increases utilizing Escherichia coli UB1005 cells (16Kondejewski L.H.

In this study we systematically replaced each residue in the sequence of the highly amphipathic β-sheet peptide, GS14, with its enantiomer (Table I). The rationale for these substitutions was based on the following observations: (a) In a previous study (19Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Kay C.M. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25261-25268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) we found that with certain cyclic peptides the lack of β-sheet structure and amphipathicity under aqueous conditions was the key to achieving a high specificity for microbes over human erythrocytes (i.e. a high therapeutic index). In that study, the disruption of β-sheet structure and amphipathicity was accomplished by utilizing peptides that could not form β-sheet structures due to the number of residues in the ring (19Kondejewski L.H.

(b) During the initial synthesis and cyclization of GS14 we found that racemization of the C terminus could occur during the cyclization reaction when the C terminus was a non-Pro residue and that this racemization led to loss of β-sheet structure.2 Together, these observations led us to hypothesize that GS14 could be transformed into a peptide possessing a high therapeutic index by disrupting the β-sheet character, and hence the amphipathicity, of the molecule. To accomplish this, we synthesized all 14 possible diastereomers of GS14; each contains a different single amino acid enantiomeric substitution. We also synthesized two diastereomers with two and four enantiomeric substitutions, respectively (Table I).

Open table in a new tab The CD spectra of GS14 and representative single residue substitution diastereomers under aqueous conditions are shown in Fig. 1A. It has been shown by NMR spectroscopy that both GS and GS14 possess a similar β-sheet conformation and that they also exhibit similar CD spectra with large negative ellipticities at 206 and 223 nm (19Kondejewski L.H.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). All of the single replacement diastereomers as well as those containing two or four enantiomeric substitutions exhibited CD spectra more typical of disordered structures, indicating that enantiomeric substitutions within the framework of GS14 resulted in the disruption of β-sheet structure. The CD spectra of GS14 and representative diastereomers recorded in the presence of the lipid-mimicking solvent, TFE, are shown in Fig. 1B. TFE is generally thought of as a helix-inducing solvent (see Ref. 27Sonnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8790-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar and references therein); however, recent studies have shown that aqueous solutions containing TFE can also stabilize β-hairpin and β-turn structures (28Blanco F.J. Jimenez M.A. Pineda A. Rico M. Santoro J. Nietol J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6004-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 29Cagas P.M. Corden J.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 141-160Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In 50% TFE the molar ellipticities around 206 and 223 nm were significantly enhanced for GS14 as well as all the diastereomers, suggesting an enhancement or stabilization of β-sheet structure in the peptides. However, because the shape of the observed CD spectra of these cyclic peptides is a combination of contributions by β-turns, aromatic residues, and β-sheet structure, it is difficult to assign particular secondary structural elements to these spectra (26Woody R.W.

Sequence comparison revealed that, like metabotropic glutamate receptors, the extracellular domain of the two GABAB receptor splice variants possesses an identical region homologous to the bacterial periplasmic leucine-binding protein (LBP), but lacks the cysteine-rich region common to all other family 3 receptors. A three-dimensional model of the LBP-like domain of the GABAB receptor was constructed based on the known structure of LBP. This model predicts that four of the five cysteine residues found in this GABAB receptor domain are important for its correct folding. This conclusion is supported by analysis of mutations of these Cys residues and a decrease in the thermostability of the binding site after dithiothreitol treatment. Additionally, Ser-246 was found to be critical for CGP64213 binding. Interestingly, this residue aligns with Ser-79 of LBP, which forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand. The mutation of Ser-269 was found to differently affect the affinity of various ligands, indicating that this residue is involved in the selectivity of recognition of GABAB receptor ligands. Finally, the mutation of two residues, Ser-247 and Gln-312, was found to increase the affinity for agonists and to decrease the affinity for antagonists. Such an effect of point mutations can be explained by the Venus flytrap model for receptor activation. This model proposes that the initial step in the activation of the receptor by agonist results from the closure of the two lobes of the binding domain.

A very large number of membrane receptors modulate the activity of intracellular effectors by activating heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins). 1The abbreviation used is: G-proteins, GTP-binding proteins; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; PBPs, periplasmic amino acid-binding proteins; LBP, leucine-binding protein; LIVBP, leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein; GABA, γ-amino-n-butyric acid; GABAB, γ-aminobutyric acid type B; GABAB-R1, GABABreceptor 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; APPA, 3-aminopropylphosphinic acid.1The abbreviation used is: G-proteins, GTP-binding proteins; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; PBPs, periplasmic amino acid-binding proteins; LBP, leucine-binding protein; LIVBP, leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein; GABA, γ-amino-n-butyric acid; GABAB, γ-aminobutyric acid type B; GABAB-R1, GABABreceptor 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; APPA, 3-aminopropylphosphinic acid. All G-protein-coupled receptors characterized so far possess seven putative transmembrane domains that define intracellular loops critical for the recognition and activation of G-proteins. Sequence comparison revealed the existence of at least three major families of G-protein-coupled receptors. The members from different families share no sequence similarity. Receptors homologous to rhodopsin (receptors for catecholamines, acetylcholine, certain peptides, glycoproteins, etc.) constitute the first family (family 1), which is to date the best characterized one. Family 2 receptors are those homologous to the vasoactive intestinal peptide and the glucagon receptors. Family 3 receptors comprise the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) (1Nakanishi S.

They all have a surprisingly large extracellular N terminus that shares some sequence similarity with bacterial periplasmic amino acid-binding proteins (PBPs) such as the leucine-binding protein (LBP) and the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIVBP) (7O'Hara P.J.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, the production of the entire extracellular domain of mGluR1 in insect cells revealed that this domain produced as a protein is able to fold correctly, is soluble, and is sufficient to bind glutamate and its analogues in a very similar manner as the wild-type receptor does (11Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, further evidence that this domain shares a similar three-dimensional structure with PBPs is still missing due to the lack of good radioligands. The family 3 receptors also contain 20 conserved cysteine residues; 17 are located in the N-terminal extracellular domain, 9 of which are concentrated among the 100 residues that separate the LBP-like domain and the first transmembrane domain. The functional importance of this Cys-rich region has not yet been elucidated. However, this region has been shown to be necessary for the LBP-like domain of mGluR1 to bind glutamate (11Okamoto T.

Other characteristic features of family 3 G-protein-coupled receptors are a highly conserved and short third intracellular loop critical for G-protein activation (12Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5615-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and a variable second intracellular loop important for G-protein coupling selectivity (13Pin J.-P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).The original structure of the binding domain of the family 3 receptors led to a hypothesis for their mechanism of activation. PBPs are known to be constituted of two lobes that close upon binding of the ligand, like a Venus flytrap when touched by an insect (15Mao B. Pear M.R. McCammon J.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1131-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Quiocho F.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 341-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that the two lobes of the LBP-like domain of family 3 receptors also close upon binding of the agonist and that this change in conformation is transduced to the transmembrane region to activate the G-protein (7O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and the closure of this domain upon agonist binding has also been proposed to be responsible for receptor activation (22Mano I. Lamed Y. Teichberg V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15299-15302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Recently, the cloning of the GABAB receptor revealed a protein that is distantly related to family 3 receptors. Indeed the GABAB receptor does not share all of the characteristic features of family 3 receptors described above (23Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Like other family 3 receptors, the GABAB receptor possesses a large extracellular domain that shares some limited but significant similarity with PBPs such as LBP. However, the intracellular loops of the GABAB receptor are not as well conserved as in the other family 3 receptors. Moreover, the cysteines in the LBP-like domain, highly conserved in the other family 3 receptors, are not present in the GABAB receptor, and no Cys-rich region is found in this receptor. Because high affinity and specific radioligands are available for the GABAB receptor and because this receptor is related to the family 3 G-protein-coupled receptors, it appears to be a good model for a further analysis of the possible structure of the extracellular domain of this new receptor family. This would help identify the possible role of this domain in ligand recognition and receptor activation.Here, we report the generation of a model for the GABAB-binding domain and its assessment by site-directed mutagenesis. This study shows that the extracellular domain of the GABAB receptor likely folds into two lobes separated by a hinge region like the PBPs and identifies specific residues within this domain important for ligand recognition.

Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Other characteristic features of family 3 G-protein-coupled receptors are a highly conserved and short third intracellular loop critical for G-protein activation (12Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5615-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and a variable second intracellular loop important for G-protein coupling selectivity (13Pin J.-P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The original structure of the binding domain of the family 3 receptors led to a hypothesis for their mechanism of activation. PBPs are known to be constituted of two lobes that close upon binding of the ligand, like a Venus flytrap when touched by an insect (15Mao B. Pear M.R. McCammon J.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1131-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Quiocho F.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 341-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that the two lobes of the LBP-like domain of family 3 receptors also close upon binding of the agonist and that this change in conformation is transduced to the transmembrane region to activate the G-protein (7O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R.

Lamed Y. Teichberg V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15299-15302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, the cloning of the GABAB receptor revealed a protein that is distantly related to family 3 receptors. Indeed the GABAB receptor does not share all of the characteristic features of family 3 receptors described above (23Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Like other family 3 receptors, the GABAB receptor possesses a large extracellular domain that shares some limited but significant similarity with PBPs such as LBP. However, the intracellular loops of the GABAB receptor are not as well conserved as in the other family 3 receptors. Moreover, the cysteines in the LBP-like domain, highly conserved in the other family 3 receptors, are not present in the GABAB receptor, and no Cys-rich region is found in this receptor. Because high affinity and specific radioligands are available for the GABAB receptor and because this receptor is related to the family 3 G-protein-coupled receptors, it appears to be a good model for a further analysis of the possible structure of the extracellular domain of this new receptor family. This would help identify the possible role of this domain in ligand recognition and receptor activation. Here, we report the generation of a model for the GABAB-binding domain and its assessment by site-directed mutagenesis. This study shows that the extracellular domain of the GABAB receptor likely folds into two lobes separated by a hinge region like the PBPs and identifies specific residues within this domain important for ligand recognition.

It is synthesized and secreted as a latent proenzyme in a sex-, stage-, and tissue-specific manner by the fat body, an insect metabolic tissue, of female mosquitoes during vitellogenesis in response to blood feeding. The secreted, hemolymph form of the enzyme is a large molecule, likely a hexamer, consisting of 44-kDa subunits. The deduced amino acid sequence of this 44-kDa precursor shares high similarity with cathepsin B but not with other mammalian cathepsins. We have named this mosquito enzyme vitellogenic cathepsin B (VCB). VCB decreases to 42 kDa after internalization by oocytes. In mature yolk bodies, VCB is located in the matrix surrounding the crystalline yolk protein, vitellin. At the onset of embryogenesis, VCB is further processed to 33 kDa. The embryo extract containing the 33-kDa VCB is active toward benzoyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg-para-nitroanilide, a cathepsin B-specific substrate, and degrades vitellogenin, the vitellin precursor. Both of these enzymatic activities are prevented by trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), a thiol protease inhibitor. Furthermore, addition of the anti-VCB antibody to the embryonic extract prevented cleavage of vitellogenin, strongly indicating that the activated VCB is involved in embryonic degradation of vitellin.

Cathepsin B is a thiol (cysteine) protease with both endopeptidase and peptidyldipeptidase activities.

Insect Biochem. 1988; 18: 423-434Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In these organisms, cathepsins B and L are presumably involved in the degradation of host hemoglobin.In insects and other arthropods, cathepsins B and L also participate in key developmental processes. In the flesh fly, Sarcophaga peregrina, hemocytes produce the extracellular form of a cathepsin B-like enzyme that participates in decomposition of the larval fat body during metamorphosis (28Kurata S.

Little is known, however, about the process of yolk protein degradation in the mosquito embryo. Previously, we have found that during vitellogenesis, the female fat body, a metabolic tissue analogous to the vertebrate liver, synthesizes and secretes a latent proenzyme of a serine carboxypeptidase which is homologous to yeast carboxypeptidase Y (42Hays A.R. Raikhel A.S. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1990; 199: 114-121Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 43Cho W.L. Deitsch K.W. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This 53-kDa proenzyme, which we named vitellogenic carboxypeptidase (VCP), 1The abbreviation used is: VCP, vitellogenic carboxypeptidase; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride; E-64, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane; kb, kilobase pair(s); PBM, post-blood meal; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TES, 2-{[tris-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-amino}-ethanesulfonic acid; 20E, 20-hydroxyecdysone; VCB, vitellogenic cathepsin B; VCB-Ab1, polyclonal antibodies produced against ovarian 42-kDa VCB; VCB-Ab2, polyclonal antibodies produced against the recombinatly produced VCB; Vg, vitellogenin; Vn, vitellin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; pNA, p-nitroanalide; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviation used is: VCP, vitellogenic carboxypeptidase; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride; E-64, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane; kb, kilobase pair(s); PBM, post-blood meal; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TES, 2-{[tris-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-amino}-ethanesulfonic acid; 20E, 20-hydroxyecdysone; VCB, vitellogenic cathepsin B; VCB-Ab1, polyclonal antibodies produced against ovarian 42-kDa VCB; VCB-Ab2, polyclonal antibodies produced against the recombinatly produced VCB; Vg, vitellogenin; Vn, vitellin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; pNA, p-nitroanalide; bp, base pair(s). is specifically accumulated by developing oocytes and deposited in yolk bodies. Although we have demonstrated that VCP is activated during embryogenesis, its role remains unknown.In this paper we report the discovery of an unusual cathepsin-B-like thiol protease from the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Similar to VCP, this enzyme is produced by the fat body of vitellogenic female mosquitoes in response to blood feeding. The cDNA encoding this unique mosquito enzyme, which we named vitellogenic cathepsin B (VCB), exhibits high similarity to vertebrate cathepsin B. VCB is secreted by the fat body as a latent proenzyme, similar in size to the latent tumor cathepsin B (44-kDa); it is accumulated by developing oocytes, where it is stored in yolk bodies. For the embryogenesis, VCB is processed to 33 kDa, similar in size to the activated single chain mammalian cathepsin B (16Mort J.S. Recklies A.D. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Sloane B.F. Moin K. Krepela E. Rozhin J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 333-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the embryo extract containing the 33-kDa VCB is active against benzoyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg-para-nitroanilide (Z-Arg-Arg-pNA), a cathepsin B-specific substrate, and degrades vitellogenin (Vg), a yolk protein precursor. Both enzymatic activities are prevented by trans-epoxysuccinyl -l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), a thiol protease inhibitor. Furthermore, addition of the anti-VCB antibody to the embryonic extract prevented cleavage of vitellogenin, strongly indicating that the activated VCB is involved in embryonic degradation of vitellin.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we report an unusual form of cathepsin B-like thiol protease from the mosquito, A. aegypti. Cloning and analysis of the cDNA encoding VCB demonstrated its high similarity to mammalian cathepsins B and invertebrate cathepsin B-like proteases, but not to other related cathepsins. The structural analysis of the deduced amino acid VCB sequence suggests that the folding and activity of this enzyme are likely similar to cathepsins B: the predicted start of mature VCB at Leu-125 was similar to mammalian cathepsins B; moreover, the active sites and cysteine positions of five putative disulfide bonds were conserved in VCB (Fig. 4).The mosquito VCB was also observed to resemble mammalian cathepsins B in its size. It was secreted as a proenzyme of 44 kDa similar in size to the latent pro-cathepsin B secreted by malignant cells (71Mach L. Stüwe K. Hagen A. Ballaun C. Glössl J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, the 33-kDa embryonic form of VCB exhibited the same size as the active single chain cathepsin B (71Mach L. Stüwe K. Hagen A. Ballaun C. Glössl J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).The presence of the 33-kDa embryonic form of VCB was shown to correlate with activity characteristic of cathepsin B (72Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). This activity was highly expressed with the cathepsin-B-specific substrate, Z-Arg-Arg-pNA; it was sensitive to E-64, but considerably less to chymostatin.The unique feature that we observed for this mosquito cathepsin-B-like enzyme was its exclusive synthesis and secretion by the fat body of vitellogenic female mosquitoes as a latent, high molecular size precursor consisting of five or six subunits with a molecular mass of 44 kDa. Its synthesis in the female fat body is initiated by blood feeding, and the kinetics of its secretion by the vitellogenic fat body are similar to those of the yolk protein precursors, Vg (59Cho W.L. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21823-21829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and VCP (42Hays A.R. Raikhel A.S. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1990; 199: 114-121Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 43Cho W.L. Deitsch K.W. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10821-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).We established the link between the 44-kDa fat body-secreted hemolymph VCB and the 42-kDa ovarian VCB by using the anti-42-kDa VCB (VCB-Ab1) in immunoblotting analyses. The anti-VCB-specific antibodies, generated against the recombinant protein (VCB-Ab2), verified the identity of 44 and 42 kDa, and other processed peptides as well. Despite the large amounts of VCB present in the ovary, neither its mRNA nor synthesis were detected there. Thus, the fat body is the only source of the 44-kDa polypeptide as a precursor of the ovarian 42-kDa polypeptide, which suggests that its accumulation in the ovary occurs by endocytosis, similar to other yolk protein precursors (73Raikhel A.S. Dhadialla T.S. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1992; 37: 217-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). VCB immunolocalization in the ovary confirmed that this yolk protein precursor is internalized in developing oocytes via the endocytotic pathway. Interestingly, VCB is segregated from crystalline Vn in mature yolk bodies, the accumulative endocytotic organelle of the oocyte, being present only in the non-crystalline matrix surrounding Vn. In this matrix of mature yolk bodies, VCB is mixed with VCP (66Snigirevskaya E.S. Hays A.R. Raikhel A.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, likely that the presence of both these proenzymes in the matrix surrounding crystalline Vn enhances their rapid activation at the onset of embryonic development, the point at which yolk bodies undergo acidification. The latter event has been documented for both insects and vertebrates (74Nordin J.H. Beaudoin E.L. Liu X. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 18: 177-192Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 75Fagotto F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).The fat body-secreted hemolymph form of VCB is stable latent proenzyme which unlike mammalian cathepsins B (7Rowan A.D. Mason P. Mach L. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15993-15999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 76Mach L. Schwihla H. Stüwe K. Rowan A.D. Mort J.S. Glössl J. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), cannot be activated by acidic pH alone. Here, the reduction of the hemolymph pro-VCB to 35 kDa (not 33-kDa) after treatment with acidic pH was not sufficient for enzyme activation. Clearly, an additional step or steps are required for the activation of the latent hemolymph pro-VCB. In our experiments, pro-VCB did not activate to the 33-kDa peptide itself in an in vitro transcription/translation system (Fig. 3), as has been reported for Schistosoma mansoni cathepsin-B-like cysteine protease (77Felleisen R. Klinkert M.Q. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This stability of the hemolymph pro-VCB as a latent proenzyme prior to its internalization by developing oocytes is physiologically important. It may be additionally enhanced by the presence of the glycosylation site in its proenzyme portion.After treatment with acidic pH, the ovarian extract containing the 42-kDa VCB exhibited enhanced cathepsin B activity. Significantly, under these conditions, most of the ovarian 42-kDa VCB was processed to the 33-kDa polypeptide. Although the nature of this processing event is unclear, the removal of 2 kDa from each VCB subunit apparently renders pro-VCB capable of activation by acidic pH after the onset of embryonic development. Although the activation reactions were performed using crude extracts, it is unlikely that the proteolytic processing of VCB by treatment with acidic pH was a function of another protease, as both the 44-kDa hemolymph and the 42-kDa ovarian VCB were processed to 35 and 33 kDa in the presence of protease inhibitors. Autocatalytic cleavage under acidic conditions, which has been reported for mammalian cathepsins B (7Rowan A.D. Mason P. Mach L. Mort J.S. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 293: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), may be a possible mechanism for the activation of the 42-kDa VCB in the mosquito embryo.The estimation of native molecular mass suggests that in the hemolymph, VCB exists as a hexamer or a pentamer of 44-kDa subunits (Fig. 14). A hexameric structure is characteristic for some insect hemolymph proteins (78Telfer W.H. Kunkel J.G. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1991; 36: 205-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The feature of VCB may also increase its stability in the hemolymph; alternatively, it may be important for the recognition of VCB by oocyte receptors. Here, we found that at the onset of embryonic development, when VCB was processed to the active 33-kDa form, its native size was reduced to 132 kDa, which likely corresponded to a tetramer of 33-kDa subunits. The presence of a minor 66-kDa band indicated that at least some of the 33-kDa VCB were in dimer form (Fig. 14).Our experiments utilizing 35S-labeled Vg as a substrate suggest that VCB likely plays a key role in the degradation of Vn, the major yolk protein in mosquito embryos. The embryonic extract containing the 33-kDa VCB displayed high activity to Vg digestion, and this degradation was blocked by E-64. Moreover, the specific anti-VCB antibodies almost entirely inhibited cleavage of Vg by the embryonic extract containing the 33-kDa VCB, strongly suggesting that VCB is the key enzyme in embryonic degradation of Vn in the mosquito embryo.Proteases similar to cathepsins B and L have been shown to be active during embryonic development in a number of insects and other arthropods (31Medina M.

In addition to exhibiting enzymatic properties characteristic of cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases, this Bombyx protease shows high sequence similarity to mammalian cathepsin L. Importantly, the direct action of Bombyx cathepsin L-like cysteine protease on vitellin has been demonstrated. The cDNA encoding the proenzyme of this Bombyx cathepsin L-like cysteine protease has been cloned from the ovarian cDNA library. Furthermore, immunological analyses have shown that it is produced in the ovary by follicular cells and is then deposited in developing oocytes (35Takahashi S.Y. Yamamoto Y. Shionoya Y. Kageyama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 36Yamamoto Y. Takahashi S.Y. Comp. Biochem.

Insect Physiol. 1994; 40: 447-454Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar).In Drosophila, cathepsin B-like protease is presumed to be maternally produced; however, its precise origin is not known (32Medina M. Valljo C.G. Dev. Growth Differ. 1989; 31: 241-247Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that mosquito VCP, one of the enzymes present in the yolk bodies, is secreted by the fat body (42; 43). Furthermore, immunological analyses have implicated the mosquito female fat body in the production of VCB (44KP) (66Snigirevskaya E.S. Hays A.R. Raikhel A.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For Blatella germanica, an immunocytochemical study has suggested that the fat body and follicular epithelium are the sources of the vitellin-processing protease (79Giorgi F. Yin L. Cecchettini A. Nordin J.H. Tissue & Cell. 1997; 29: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, however, we provided solid molecular and biochemical proofs that the mosquito embryonic cathepsin B-like protease that we describe here is produced exclusively by the fat body as a yolk protein precursor.In oviparous animals, extraovarian tissues play an important role in egg maturation by producing yolk protein precursors, which serve as a major nutritional source for developing embryos. The liver of oviparous vertebrates and the fat body of insects both produce large quantities of yolk protein precursors, which are subsequently internalized by developing oocytes and deposited in yolk bodies. The most abundant of these yolk protein precursors is Vg, a large glycophospholipoprotein conserved throughout evolution of invertebrate and vertebrate oviparous animals (80Wahli W. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 227-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 81Byrne B.M. Gruber M. AB G. Progr. Biophys. Mol.

In Lepidopteran insects, the fat body additionally produces a smaller yolk protein precursor, either microvitellogenin or the 30-kDa yolk protein (84Kawooya J.K. Osir E.O. Law J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10844-10849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 85Kulakosky P.C. Telfer W.H. Insect Biochem. 1987; 19: 367-373Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 86Zhu J. Indrasith L.S. Yamashita O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 882: 427-436Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar).In the mosquito, however, the proenzymes VCB and VCP are produced by the fat body as yolk protein precursors. The discovery that enzymes involved in the embryonic degradation of yolk proteins are produced as precursors by an extraovarian tissue is a new biological phenomenon previously unknown in insects or other oviparous animals. Moreover, the finding that one of these enzymes is a cathepsin B sheds light on yet another important mode of the utilization of this key protease. Cathepsin B is a thiol (cysteine) protease with both endopeptidase and peptidyldipeptidase activities. Due to its broad specificity, cathepsin B plays a key role in intracellular protein catabolism in the lysosomal system (1Bond J.S. Butler P.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Cathepsin B has been well characterized both enzymatically and molecularly (2Takio K. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Teller D.C.

The efficacy of conventional chemotherapy in solid tumors is limited because tumors frequently have mutations in the p53 gene. Also, chemotherapy only kills rapidly dividing cells. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, however, induce apoptosis regardless of the p53 phenotype. Unfortunately, the cytotoxicity of TNF-α is limited by its activation of NF-κB and activation of NF-κB is proinflammatory. We have identified a compound called PG490, that is composed of purified triptolide, which induces apoptosis in tumor cells and sensitizes tumor cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. PG490 potently inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB. PG490 also blocked TNF-α-mediated induction of c-IAP2 (hiap-1) and c-IAP1 (hiap-2), members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family. Interestingly, PG490 did not block DNA binding of NF-κB, but it blocked transactivation of NF-κB. Our identification of a compound that blocks TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB may enhance the cytotoxicity of TNF-α on tumors in vivo and limit its proinflammatory effects.

Despite the development of new chemotherapeutic agents and aggressive treatment of solid tumors there has been sporadic improvement in long term survival. We have focused our efforts on enhancing cytotoxicity in solid tumor cell lines with members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviation used is: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; CBP, cAMP response element-binding protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction. family. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), for example, shows broad cytotoxicity against many tumor cell lines but its clinical use is limited because it induces a profound inflammatory response through activation of NF-κB. Moreover, activation of NF-κB inhibits TNF-α-induced apoptosis. We, therefore, set out to identify compounds that would sensitize tumor cells to TNF-α through inhibition of NF-κB. Extracts of traditional Chinese herbs have been used for many years in China to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. An alcohol extract of the Chinese herb Tripterygium Wilfordii hook called T2 has potent antiinflammatory properties and has been suggested to be effective for the treatment of arthritis (1Gu W.Z. Brandwein S.R. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1998; 20: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The purified component of T2, which possesses immunosuppressive activity is the diterpene triepoxide, triptolide. Interestingly, triptolide also possesses anticancer activity. For example, it shows potent antileukemic activity in animal models, it inhibits proliferation of tumor cell lines, and it shows antitumor activity in a murine breast tumor model (2Shamon L.A. Pezzuto J.M. Graves J.M. Mehta R.R. Wangcharoentrakul S. Sangsuwan R. Chaichana S. Tuchinda P. Cleason P. Reutrakul V. Cancer Lett. 1997; 112: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 3Kupchan S.M. Schubert R.M. Science. 1974; 185: 791-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). NF-κB is the prototype of a family of dimeric transcription factors that have Rel regions, which bind to DNA, interact with each other, and bind the IκB inhibitors (reviewed in Ref. 4Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). NF-κB regulates the expression of many biologically important genes such as those encoding inflammatory cytokines, interferons, growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, and viruses. A recent role for NF-κB in the control of apoptosis has been demonstrated based on the observation that mice lacking RelA (p65) die during embryogenesis from massive liver cell apoptosis (5Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Several studies have now demonstrated an essential role for NF-κB in preventing apoptosis induced by TNF-α and chemotherapy (6Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 7Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 8Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). In these studies, cells were made sensitive to TNF-α and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis through inhibition of NF-κB activity. Also, a recent study demonstrated that the downstream effectors of NF-κB activation, which include TRAF-1 (TNFR-associated factor 1), TRAF2, and c-IAP1, also known as hiap-2, and c-IAP2, also known as hiap-1, were required to suppress TNF-α-induced apoptosis (9Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). These studies clearly demonstrate that activation of NF-κB suppresses apoptosis in tumor cells and tumor cells are sensitized to TNF-α-induced apoptosis through inhibition of NF-κB. Here we show that purified triptolide sensitizes several solid tumor cell lines to TNF-α-induced apoptosis through inhibition of NF-κB. Additionally, triptolide alone induces apoptosis in tumor cells. Interestingly, triptolide inhibited transcriptional activation of NF-κB but not DNA binding of NF-κB. Also, triptolide blocked induction of c-IAP2 and c-IAP1 by TNF-α. We propose that the ability of triptolide to augment TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity while simultaneously inhibiting activation of NF-κB may enhance the cytotoxic potential of TNF-α and limit its proinflammatory effectsin vivo. PG490 (triptolide, molecular weight, 360) was obtained from Pharmagenesis (Palo Alto, CA). The material was composed of white to off-white crystals, had a melting point of 226–240 °C, conformed to a standard triptolide preparation by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (10Kupchan S.M.

Fidler and R. L. Jin, private communication. A549 (nonsmall cell lung cancer) and HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) cell lines were purchased from ATCC. An MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell subline was provided by Dr. Ron Weigel (Stanford University). Cells were cultured in the appropriate media with 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. TNF-α was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and phorbol myristyl acetate from Sigma. Cells were left untreated or stimulated with PG490 (20 ng/ml) and/or TNF-α (10 ng/ml), and 6 h after the addition of TNF-α, cells were harvested for analysis of luciferase activity according to the manufacuter's protocol (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). In experiments with PG490 and TNF-α, cells were pretreated with PG490 for 4 h before the addition of TNF-α. Luciferase activity was measured in samples that contained equal protein concentration with a Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). An oligonucleotide containing the IgGκ-NF-κB site (sequence 5′-GGGGACTTTCC-3′) was placed upstream of a minimal interleukin-8 promoter (position −67 to +44) in a luciferase reporter gene construct and stably tranfected into A549, HT180, and MCF-7 cells. Resistant clones were pooled after selection in 400–600 μg/ml G418. The IκBα super-repressor construct was provided by Dean Ballard, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN (11Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C.

The Gal4-luciferase construct was provided by Jeff Riegel (Stanford University) and contains 5× Gal4 binding sites upstream of a minimal interleukin-2 promoter with a luciferase reporter gene. Cell viability was measured by a 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Briefly, untreated cells or cells treated with PG490 and/or TNF-α in a 96-well plate were harvested at the indicated times followed by the addition of 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide to the cells. Cells were then solubilized with 0.1n acidified CH3Cl-HCL. The 96-well plate was read at a wavelength of 590 nm on an iEMS Labsystems plate reader. Induction of cell death by TNF-α, PG490, and PG490 plus TNF-α was confirmed as apoptotic by Annexin staining followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described previously (13Wen L.P.

Nuclear extracts were prepared using a protocol described previously (14Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously using a Klenow-labeled 32P-IgG NF-κB site as a probe (15Rosen G.D. Barks J.L. Iademarco M.F. Fisher R.J. Dean D.C. J.

To detect the association of p65 with cAMP response element-binding protein (CBP) in untreated A549 cells or A549 cells treated with PG490 (20 ng/ml) and/or TNF-α (10 ng/ml), cellular protein was extracted for immunoprecipitation as described previously (13Wen L.P.

Cellular protein was immunoprecipitated with a CBP mouse polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by Western blot analysis with a p65 mouse monoclonal antibody (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA) using a Western blot protocol described previously (13Wen L.P.

RNA was harvested from A549 cells with RNA STAT-60, a solution containing guanidine isothiocyanate and phenol (Tel-Test “B”, Friendswood, TX), and Northern blot analysis was done as described previously (16Wen L.P. Madani K. Fahrni J.A. Duncan S.R. Rosen G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L921-L929PubMed Google Scholar). The c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 cDNAs were provided by Dr. David Goeddel (Tularik, South San Francisco, CA). A plasmid that contains a 115-base pair fragment from the 28 S ribosomal RNA cDNA was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), excised with KpnI and XbaI and used in Northern blot analysis to demonstrate equal loading of RNA. For RT-PCR RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells using RNA STA-60 and subjected to RT-PCR with oligonucleotide primers for c-IAP2. In an effort to sensitize tumor cells to TNF-α, we sought out compounds that would sensitize tumor cells to TNF-α through inhibition of NF-κB. PG490 (triptolide) is a diterpene epoxide derived from a traditional Chinese herb that possesses potent immunosuppressive and anticancer activityin vitro (1Gu W.Z. Brandwein S.R. Int. J.

Triptolide was shown to inhibit induction of cytokine expression in T cells (17Yang S.X. Xie S.S. Gao H.L. Ma D.L. Long Z.Z. Int. J.

NF-κB is, therefore, a putative target for triptolide. We examined, therefore, whether PG490 inhibits TNF-α-mediated activation of NF-κB and sensitizes tumor cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. PG490 alone decreased cell viability by 40–70% of cells in several solid tumor cell lines at dosages between 5–20 ng/ml (TableI). Cell death was confirmed as apoptotic by Annexin staining followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown). Cell death was maximal at 48 h after the addition of PG490. Several tumor cells lines such as HT1080 cells are resistant to TNF-α because of NF-κB activation following stimulation with TNF-α. We also found that A549 lung cancer cells are resistant to TNF-α-induced apoptosis (Table I). MCF-7 breast cancer cells show intermediate sensitivity to TNF-α with TNF-α inducing cell death in approximately 30% of cells (Table I). A recent study confirms differences in the sensitivity of MCF-7 sublines to TNF-α (20Burow M.E. Weldon C.B. Tang Y. Navar G.L. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Hammond T.G. Clejan S. Beckman B.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4940-4946PubMed Google Scholar). PG490 alone (20 ng/ml) induced cell death in approximately 30% of cells in the A549 cell line but the combination of PG490 and TNF-α-induced cell death in over 80% of cells (Table I). In contrast to A549 cells, PG490 alone (20 ng/ml) induced cell death in 70–75% of cells in the MCF-7 cell line and 50–55% of cells in the HT1080 cell line (Table I). PG490 at a concentration of 5 ng/ml induced cell death in approximately 35% of MCF-7 cells and the combination of PG490 (5 ng/ml) plus TNF-α induced cell death in approximately 80% of MCF-7 cells (Table I). In HT1080 cells the combination of PG490 (20 ng/ml) plus TNF-α induced cell death in more than 99% of cells (TableI).Table IEffect of PG490 and TNF-α on tumor cell viabilityTreatmentCell LineA549HT1080MCF-7PG490 5 ng/ml87.9 ± 7.086.6 ± 6.563.9 ± 9.9PG490 20 ng/ml67.5 ± 5.446.4 ± 4.830.5 ± 9.3TNF-α 10 ng/ml93.4 ± 1.394.7 ± 3.567.8 ± 6.5PG490 5 ng/ml + TNF-α 10 ng/ml79.6 ± 9.171.2 ± 2.921.4 ± 3.0PG490 20 ng/ml + TNF-α 10 ng/ml17.4 ± 10.40.2 ± 0.315.6 ± 4.1Cell lines were incubated with PG490 and/or TNF-α for 48 h followed by analysis of cell viability by an MTT assay.

In view of recent studies, which show that inhibition of NF-κB following TNF-α stimulation augments TNF-α-induced apoptosis in tumor cells, we examined whether PG490 inhibits TNF-α-mediated activation of NF-κB in HT1080, A549, and MCF-7 cells. We found that PG490 inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of an IgGκ NF-κB luciferase reporter gene construct in all three cell lines but PG490 did not affect basal NF-κB activity (Fig. 1). PG490 alone did not affect basal NF-κB activity in A549 and HT1080 cells but it slightly induced NF-κB transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells. We have observed that PG490 inhibits expression of the IκBα protein in MCF-7 cells leading to increased binding of NF-κB, which may explain the increase in NF-κB transcriptional activity (data not shown). We confirmed, through overexpression of an IκBα super-repressor construct, that inhibition of NF-κB sensitizes HT1080 cells to TNF-α as was described previously (7Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We also found that inhibition of NF-κB with MG132 (3 μm), a proteasome inhibitor, or with a calpain inhibitor sensitizes A549 and MCF-7 cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis (data not shown). To determine whether PG490 inhibits activation of NF-κB through the inhibition of DNA binding of NF-κB, we examined the effect of PG490 on TNF-α-induced binding of NF-κB by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. TNF-α induced binding of NF-κB in A549 cells, and an antibody to p65 (Rel A) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) supershifted the complex demonstrating that p65 is part of the NF-κB complex induced by TNF-α (Fig. 2). PG490 did not affect the intensity of the NF-κB complex induced by TNF-α or its migration in A549 cells (Fig. 2). PG490 alone did not induce binding of NF-κB; antibodies to p65 also supershifted a specific complex in PG490 plus TNF-α-treated cells (Fig. 2). PG490 also did not affect TNF-α-induced binding of NF-κB in HT1080 or MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Our results suggest, therefore, that PG490 inhibits transactivation but not DNA binding of NF-κB. Recent studies show that phosphorylation of p65 is important for transcriptional activation of NF-κB (21Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol.

Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide induces phosphorylation of p65 on serine 276, which increases p65-mediated transactivation. Also, Wang et al. (22Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) showed that TNF-α induces phosphorylation of p65 on serine 529, in the C-terminal region of p65. They demonstrate that inducible phosphorylation of p65 does not affect nuclear translocation or DNA binding activity of NF-κB but it increases transcriptional activity. Because PG490 blocks transactivation of NF-κB but not DNA binding we hypothesized that PG490 would inhibit transactivation of p65. A plasmid encoding a fusion protein of the transactivating domains of p65, Gal4-p65521–551 (Gal4-p65 TA1) or Gal4-p65268–551 (Gal4-p65 TA2), with the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4, was transfected into A549 cells along with a luciferase reporter containing upstream Gal4 binding sites. The TA1 domain is contained within the TA2 construct. We found that PG490 blocked transcriptional activity of the TA1 domain of p65 by 20–25% and of the TA2 domain by over 50% (Fig. 3). TNF-α did not stimulate transcriptional activity of the TA1 or TA2 domain even when the A549 cells were grown in medium containing 0.1% serum, which reduced basal NF-κB activity (data not shown). This lack of response to TNF-α may be explained by our observation that A549 cells contain significant basal NF-κB activity (see Fig. 4). Nonetheless, PG490 significantly blocked transcriptional activity of the transactivating domains of p65.Figure 4PG490 does not affect the interaction of p65 with CBP . A549 cells were treated as shown and as described in the legend for Fig. 1, and cellular extract was immunoprecipitated with a CBP rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by Western blot analysis with a p65 mouse monoclonal antibody (BIOMOL).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recent studies suggest that CBP/p300 are transcriptional coactivators of the p65 subunit of NF-κB (21Zhong H.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The interaction of p65 with CBP/p300 requires phosphorylation of p65 at serine 276 (21Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). p65 then interacts with CBP/p300 in the nucleus, which enhances NF-κB-dependent transcription (21Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). We examined whether PG490 inhibits transactivation of NF-κB by blocking the interaction of p65 with CBP/p300. We found that p65 associated with CBP/p300 in unstimulated A549 cells, and this complex was induced by TNF-α (Fig. 4). PG490, however, did not affect the intensity or migration of the p65·CBP complex in TNF-α-treated A549 cells (Fig. 4). PG490 alone, in fact, increased the association of CBP with p65 in unstimulated A549 cells (Fig. 4). Recent studies demonstrate that members of the inhibitor of apoptosis family such as c-IAP1 (hiap-2) and c-IAP2 (hiap-1) suppress TNF-α-mediated cell death (9Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 24Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PG490 would block induction of c-IAP2 and c-IAP1 by TNF-α. TNF-α induced a 6-fold increase in c-IAP2 mRNA and a 4-fold increase in c-IAP1 mRNA in A549 cells, which was almost completely blocked by PG490 (Fig. 5, A and B). TNF-α also induced a 4-fold increase in c-IAP2 mRNA in MCF-7 cells, which was blocked by PG490 (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that PG490 sensitizes tumor cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis, at least in part, by suppressing the induction of c-IAP2 and c-IAP1. Over 50–70% of solid tumors harbor mutations in p53, which confers relative chemoresistance. TNF family members such as TNF-α, Fas, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, also known as Apo2L, induce apoptosis in tumor cells regardless of the p53 phenotype. Unfortunately, TNF-α-induced apoptosis is limited by activation of NF-κB. Additionally, activation of NF-κB induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which damage the host. We set out to identify a compound that sensitizes tumor cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis through inhibition of NF-κB. PG490 (triptolide) is an oxygenated diterpene derived from a traditional Chinese herb that has been used as an immunosuppressant in China for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. There are also studies that show PG490 is cytotoxic in leukemia and breast cancer cell lines. We show here that PG490 cooperates with TNF-α to induce apoptosis in diverse solid tumor cell lines. PG490 alone induces apoptosis in 30–70% of cells in the A549, HT1080, and MCF-7 cell lines. We have found that other tumor cell lines are even more sensitive to PG490-induced apoptosis (data not shown). We are presently investigating the mechanism of PG490-induced apoptosis. We also show that PG490 almost completely suppresses TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and sensitizes tumor cell lines to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Recent studies suggest that c-IAP1 (hiap-2) and c-IAP2 (hiap-1) mediate, at least in part, the resistance of some tumor cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. We found that TNF-α induced c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 and that PG490 blocked TNF-α-mediated induction of c-IAP2 and c-IAP1 (Fig. 5). PG490 did not affect the DNA binding of NF-κB but it blocked transactivation of NF-κB. Recent studies suggest that transactivation of NF-κB is enhanced through the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-276 and Ser-529 (21Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 22Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide induces phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-276, which promotes the interaction of p65 with CBP/p300 in the nucleus (21Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). This interaction enhances transactivation of NF-κB. A recent study showed that TNF-α induces phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-529 in the C-terminal region of p65 (22Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-529 also enhances transactivation of NF-κB but a transcriptional coactivator that interacts with p65 phosphorylated at Ser-529 has, as yet, not been identified. We show that PG490 inhibits transactivation of both the TA1 and TA2 regions of p65 (Fig. 3). PG490 did not, however, affect the interaction of p65 with CBP in TNF-α treated cells (Fig. 4). Our results suggest, therefore, that PG490 may block the phosphorylation of NF-κB at Ser-529 and/or the association of p65 with an, as yet, unidentified transcriptional cofactor in the nucleus. We are presently examining the effect of PG490 on the phosphorylation of p65. Our data, nonetheless, suggests that PG490 inhibits activation of NF-κB by a novel mechanism. In A549 cells we observed some basal NF-κB activity reflected by the interaction of p65 with CBP/p300 in unstimulated cells (Fig. 4). Also, the IgG NF-κB luciferase reporter construct was active in unstimulated cells (data not shown). Basal NF-κB activity in A549 cells may explain why TNF-α did not induce Gal4-p65 TA1 transcriptional activity and it suggests that phosphorylation of p65 in A549 cells is partly constitutive. In support of this possibility, a recent study showed that TNF-α only weakly induces phosphorylation of p65 in COS cells, because phosphorylation of p65 is largely constitutive (22Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The identification of compounds that are both cytotoxic and block activation of NF-κB may enhance the cytotoxicity of TNF family members in vivo. We are presently examining the effect of PG490 in combination with TNF-α and in combination with chemotherapy in tumor xenograft models in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2046511609,"Isoprostanes are prostaglandin-like compounds produced by non-enzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid. The cyclooxygenase-derived endoperoxide, prostaglandin H2, can undergo rearrangement to highly reactive γ-ketoaldehyde secoprostanoids (levuglandin E2 and D2). We explored whether isoprostane endoperoxide intermediates also rearrange to levuglandin-like compounds (isolevuglandins). Formation of a series of isolevuglandins during oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro was established utilizing a number of mass spectrometric analyses. However, these compounds could not be detected in free form in protein-containing biological systems, which we hypothesized was due to extremely rapid adduction to amines. This was supported by the finding that >60% of levuglandin E2 adducted to albumin within 20 s, whereas ∼50% of 4-hydroxynonenal still remained unadducted after 1 h. By utilizing electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, we established that these compounds form oxidized pyrrole adducts (lactams and hydroxylactams) with lysine. Formation of isolevuglandin-lysine adducts on apolipoprotein B was readily detected during oxidation of low density lipoprotein following enzymatic digestion of the protein to single amino acids. These studies identify a novel series of extremely reactive products of the isoprostane pathway that rapidly form covalent adducts with lysine residues on proteins.

A role for free radicals has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of human diseases including atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4450) Google Scholar). Unsaturated fatty acids are a major target of free radical attack leading to lipid peroxidation. A variety of compounds is generated as products of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation including reactive aldehyde species, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) 1The abbreviation used is: 4-HNE, 4-hydroxynonenal; MDA, malondialdehyde; LDL, low density lipoprotein; apoB-100, apolipoprotein B; PG, prostaglandin; IsoPs, isoprostanes; LG, levuglandin; IsoLGs, isolevuglandins; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; NICI, negative ion chemical ionization; EI, electron impact ionization; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LC, liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; SRM, selected reaction monitoring; TMS, trimethylsilyl; CID, collision-induced dissociation; BSA, bovine serum albumin; BSTFA, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide; AAPH, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)HCl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. and malondialdehyde (MDA). These reactive aldehydes are considered important mediators of oxidant injury due to their ability to covalently modify proteins and DNA, which can disrupt important cellular functions and can cause mutations (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5902) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adduction of aldehydes to apolipoprotein B in LDL has been strongly implicated in the mechanism by which LDL is converted to an atherogenic form that is taken up by macrophages, eventuating in the formation of foam cells (3Steinberg D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 369: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Previously we reported the formation of prostaglandin (PG)-like compounds in vivo, termed isoprostanes (IsoPs), by free radical-induced peroxidation of arachidonic acid (4Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts II., L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Analogous to the cyclooxygenase enzymatic pathway, intermediates in the IsoP pathway are PGH2-like bicyclic endoperoxides. In aqueous media, PGH2 is unstable and undergoes rearrangement with at½ of approximately 5 min at 37 °C (5Salomon R.G. Miller D.B. Zagorski M.G. Coughlin D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 6049-6060Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Originally, it was shown PGH2 undergoes rearrangement to form PGE2 and PGD2 (6Hamburg M. Samuelsson B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 2349Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recently, Salomon and colleagues (5Salomon R.G. Miller D.B. Zagorski M.G. Coughlin D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 6049-6060Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PGH2 also rearranges to form γ-ketoaldehyde secoprostanoids. These compounds have been termed levuglandin E2 and D2 because of their structural similarities with levulinaldehyde. Levuglandins comprise approximately 20% of the total rearrangement products of PGH2 (5Salomon R.G. Miller D.B. Zagorski M.G. Coughlin D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 6049-6060Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Initially we reported the formation of F2-IsoPs, which are produced by reduction of the IsoP endoperoxide intermediates (4Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts II., L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). We recently discovered a key role for glutathione in effecting the reduction of IsoP endoperoxides to F2-IsoPs (7Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Daniel V.C. Awad J.A. Mirochnitchenko O. Swift L.L. Burk R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the reduction of IsoP endoperoxides is not completely efficient. In this regard, we have shown that the IsoP endoperoxides undergo rearrangement in vivo to form E2-IsoPs, D2-IsoPs, and isothromboxanes (8Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R.

Based on the observation that the IsoP endoperoxides undergo rearrangement in vivo, we explored whether such rearrangement also results in the formation of levuglandin-like compounds, for which we propose the term isolevuglandins (IsoLGs). Our interest in this possibility stems from the fact that the γ-ketoaldehyde moiety confers remarkable reactivity to these compounds. In this regard, Salomon and colleagues (10Iyer R.S. Ghosh S. Salomon R.G. Prostaglandins. 1989; 37: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Murthi K.K. Friedman L.R. Olenick N.L. Salomon R.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4090-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have shown that LGE2 rapidly adducts to amines and, in addition, readily undergoes further reaction to form extensive protein-protein and protein-DNA cross-links. Thus, if formed, IsoLGs might participate as important mediators of oxidant injury. Therefore, we undertook studies to explore whether IsoLGs are formed during oxidation of arachidonic acid and studies to elucidate the nature of the IsoLG adduct that would be formed with lysine residues on proteins. The mechanism by which IsoLGs are generated by free radical-induced oxidation of arachidonic acid is shown in Fig. 1. Four regioisomers of both D2-IsoLGs and E2-IsoLGs are formed, each of which is theoretically comprised of four racemic diastereomers, for a total of 32 IsoLGE2 and 32 IsoLGD2 compounds. The designation “D” and “E” is the same as for the cyclooxygenase-derived LGs and refers to the location of the keto group. If the keto group is located at C-9, the molecule is designated an E2-IsoLG, and if it is located at C-11, the molecule is designated as a D2-IsoLG. Salomon and co-workers (12Iyer R.S. Miller D.B. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3171-3180Google Scholar) had previously used a carbon numbering system from 1 to 17 beginning with the carboxyl carbon, and the chains containing the carbonyl groups were considered as substituents. However, to retain consistency with the official nomenclature for isoprostanes that has been approved by the Eicosanoid Nomenclature Committee, sanctioned by JCBN of IUPAC (13Taber D.F. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Prostaglandins. 1997; 53: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the original 20 carbon numbering system used for the IsoP endoperoxide precursors will be retained. In accordance with the IsoP nomenclature, the different regioisomers are designated by the carbon number on which the side chain hydroxyl is located, as indicated in Fig. 1. Five mg of arachidonic acid (Nu Chek Prep, Elysian, MN) or 1-palmitoyl, 2-arachidonoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Sigma) was dissolved in 200 μl of ethanol and oxidized using a mixture of ferric chloride (1 mm), ADP (200 mm), and ascorbate (100 mm) in 5 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 6 h. Following oxidation of arachidonic acid or 1-palmitoyl, 2-arachidonoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine, compounds were converted toO-methyloxime derivatives by addition of 3% methoxyamine·HCl and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Compounds formed from the oxidation of phosphatidylcholine were subsequently subjected to base hydrolysis with 7.5% KOH in 50% aqueous methanol for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were then acidified to pH 3 with 1 n HCl and diluted. 1–4 ng of bis-[2H3]O-methyloxime-LGE2, which was formed by treatment of synthetic LGE2 (14Miller D.B. Raychaudhuri S.R. Avasthi K. Lal K. Levison B. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3164-3175Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with [2H3]methoxyamine·HCl (Regis, Morton Grove, IL), was added as an internal standard. The concentration of the bis-[2H3]O-methyloxime-LGE2was standardized against PGF2α by gas chromatography (GC)/negative ion chemical ionization (NICI)/mass spectrometry (MS). The sample was then applied to a C18 Sep-Pak column (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) that had been pre-conditioned with 5 ml of methanol and 10 ml of pH 3 water. The Sep-Pak was washed sequentially with 10 ml of pH 3 water and 10 ml of heptane/ethyl acetate (99:1 v/v), and the IsoLGs were then eluted with 10 ml of heptane/ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v). The heptane/ethyl acetate was dried under a stream of N2. The samples were then converted to a pentafluorobenzyl ester derivative by treatment with 40 μl of 10% pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile and 20 μl of 10%N,N-diisopropylethylamine in acetonitrile for 20 min at 37 °C. Samples were then subjected to thin layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel plates (VWR Scientific, Atlanta, GA) using the solvent heptane/ethyl acetate (60:40 v/v). Compounds migrating 2 cm above and 0.5 cm below the bis-O-methyloxime, pentafluorobenzyl ester derivative of LGE2 were scraped and extracted from the silica gel with ethyl acetate. IsoLGs were then converted to trimethylsilyl (TMS) ether derivatives by treatment with 10 μl of dimethylformamide and 10 μl ofN,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and analyzed by GC/NICI/MS. GC was performed with a 12-m DB 1701 fused silica capillary column (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) heated from 190 to 300 °C at 20 °C/min with a 0.2-min hold. Source temperature was 250 °C. Determination of functional groups was accomplished by subjecting 2 ml of an arachidonate oxidation mixture to derivatization with methoxyamine·HCl or [2H3]methoxyamine·HCl. No internal standard was added. Derivatization was continued as above except each sample was divided equally after TLC and half derivatized with BSTFA as above and half with [2H9]BSTFA (Deutero-Regisil-d 18, Regis, Morton Grove, IL) (6 μl + 6 μl dimethylformamide). Samples were then analyzed by GC/NICI/MS, employing selected ion monitoring for the [M −⋅CH2C6F5]− ion of each derivative. Disappearance of signals was monitored as well as appearance of signals, i.e. the presence of two carbonyl groups was indicated by the disappearance of signals at m/z481 and the appearance of signals at m/z 487 in samples treated with [2H3]methoxyamine·HCl and BSTFA, and the presence of a single hydroxyl group was indicated by the disappearance of signals at m/z 481 and the appearance of signals at m/z 490 in samples treated with methoxyamine·HCl and [2H9]BSTFA. For analysis of IsoLGs by electron impact ionization (EI)/MS, methoximated IsoLGs were purified by reverse phase HPLC on an Econosil C18 column (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) utilizing a solvent system of 45% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% acetic acid. One-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing IsoLGs were identified by analysis of aliquots as above by GC/NICI/MS. IsoLGs were detected eluting over approximately 30 fractions. Eight fractions eluting at approximately 30 ml, which contained a high concentration of IsoLGs, were pooled. This purification procedure was repeated several times to obtain sufficient material for analysis by GC/EI/MS. GC/EI/MS analysis yielded a single prominent chromatographic peak with a smaller shoulder that contained ions consistent with mass spectra of IsoLGs at an approximate retention time of 9 min. This retention time is longer than the retention time of IsoLGs in the GC/NICI/MS experiments described above (approximately 6 min) because a longer GC column was used to achieve more effective separation of IsoLGs from other potentially interfering compounds. Spectra were displayed by averaging the scans across the chromatographic peaks. The source temperature was 200 °C, the ionization energy 70 eV, and the transfer line and injector each held at 250 °C. D-ring, E-ring, and F-ring IsoPs generated from oxidation of arachidonic acid were quantified by GC/NICI/MS as described (4Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts II., L.J.

Free unadducted 4-HNE was measured by colorimetric assay (Oxis International, Portland, OR). LGE2 (1 mm) was incubated with [3H]lysine (1 mm; 17,000 cpm/mg) in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 4 h. Incubations were also performed in which lysine was replaced with [U-13C]lysine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) or N α-acetyl-lysine methyl ester (Sigma). 100-μl aliquots of the incubation mixtures were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)/electrospray ionization (ESI)/MS in the positive ion mode using a Waters 2.1 × 150 mm C18 column and a water/acetonitrile gradient (3%/min; hold 5 min) at 0.2 ml/min. Auxiliary gas pressure was 70 pounds/square inch; sheath gas pressure was 10 pounds/square inch. The voltage on the capillary was 20.0 V, the capillary temperature 200 °C, and the tube lens voltage 90 V. Parent ions were scanned from m/z 400 to m/z 500. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of molecular ions of the putative lactam and hydroxylactam adducts formed in these incubations was performed from −10 to −40 eV, scanning daughter ions fromm/z 50 to m/z 500 (up to m/z 560 for the N α-acetyl-lysine methyl ester derivative). Spectra shown were obtained at −28 eV. CID gas was argon with a pressure set at 2.0 millitorr. Spectra were displayed by averaging scans across the chromatographic peaks. 100 mg of arachidonic acid was oxidized as described above in the presence of 100 mg of lysine. The incubation mixture was then loaded onto a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge in pH 3 water, washed sequentially with 10 ml of water, 10 ml of heptane, and 10 ml of heptane/ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v). Adducts were eluted with 10 ml methanol/ethyl acetate (35:65 v/v). The organic solvents were then dried under a stream of N2, and an aliquot was analyzed by LC/ESI/MS/MS using conditions described above except the LC flow rate was 0.1 ml/min. MS/MS analysis was carried out using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) of daughter ions produced from CID of [MH]+ at −28 eV. 1/20 of this preparation was analyzed by SRM of daughter ions of the lactam adducts, and approximately 1/3 was analyzed by SRM of daughter ions of the hydroxylactam adducts. LDL was isolated from 10 ml of plasma obtained from normal human volunteers using a low temperature ethanol precipitation procedure (15Mills G.L. Lane P.A. Weech P.K. A Guidebook to Lipoprotein Technique. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 87Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasma was stirred with a 25% ethanol solution at −5 °C for 15 min and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 30 min at −5 °C. The precipitated LDL was then suspended in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at a concentration of 10 mg of protein/ml and oxidized with 0.1 mm2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) HCl (AAPH) (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) for 4 h. The LDL was subsequently re-precipitated as above and delipidated (15Mills G.L. Lane P.A. Weech P.K. A Guidebook to Lipoprotein Technique. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 87Google Scholar). Briefly, the LDL was diluted to 10 mg of protein/ml and then sequentially extracted with ethanol/diethyl ether (2:3 v/v) for 24 h; ethanol/ether (3:1 v/v) for 24 h; ethanol/ether (1:1 v/v) for 30 min; ethanol/ether (1:3 v/v) for 30 min; and finally briefly washed with ether. The temperature was maintained at −15 °C during the delipidation procedure. The protein was recovered after each extraction by centrifugation at 850 × g for 20 min. The protein was re-dissolved by suspending it in ether, and 0.2n NaOH was then added. The mixture was gently bubbled with N2 until the ether evaporated and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature to hydrolyze IsoLG protein adducts that may have formed with IsoLG esterified to LDL lipids. The pH was then adjusted to 7.5, and the protein was subjected to complete enzymatic digestion to individual amino acids as described (16DeCaprio A.P. Olajos E.J. Weber P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1982; 65: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. 0.1 volume of a 1 mg/ml solution of Pronase (Calbiochem) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The pH was then adjusted to 8.5, and MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 4.8 mm. 0.1 volume of leucine aminopeptidase (Sigma) activation solution was subsequently added. Leucine aminopeptidase was activated by incubating 225 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) with 1 mm MnCl2 for 2–3 h at 40 °C and subsequently added to the digest, which was then incubated at 37 °C for 18 h at room temperature. The compounds were then extracted using a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge as described above. The eluate was dried under a stream of N2, and IsoLG/lysine adducts were analyzed by LC/ESI/MS/MS as described for the IsoLG adducts above. Before analysis, a mixture of [13C6]lactam and [13C6]hydroxylactam IsoLG adducts was added to allow quantification of the amount of IsoLG adducts detected. These compounds were formed by oxidation of 25 mg of arachidonic acid in the presence of [3H]lysine (50 × 106 cpm; 10,000 cpm/μg) (NEN Life Science Products) diluted with 1 mg of [13C6]lysine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA). The [3H]- and [13C6]lysine-IsoLG lactam, and hydroxylactam adducts formed were then purified by extraction on C18Sep-Pak cartridges as above and HPLC (water to acetonitrile in 30 min with 5-min water pre-wash). HPLC fractions containing the lysyl IsoLG adducts were detected by LC/ESI/MS analysis, and the concentration was determined by the specific activity of the [3H]lysine. GC/NICI/MS analysis of oxidized arachidonate mixtures revealed a series of compounds with characteristics of IsoLGs (Fig. 2). The lower m/z 487 chromatogram displays a series of incompletely resolved peaks corresponding to the [M −⋅CH2C6F5]− ion of the bis-[2H3]O-methyloxime LGE2 internal standard. These represent the four methoxime isomers (two syn and two ante) resulting from methoximation of the two carbonyl groups of the internal standard. At a similar retention time in the upper m/z 481 chromatogram are a series of peaks with the [M −⋅CH2C6F5]− ion of IsoLGs. The pattern of the putative IsoLG compounds differs from that seen in the m/z 487 chromatogram, consistent with the formation of multiple IsoLGE2 and IsoLGD2isomers (see Fig. 1). Virtually identical results were obtained from the analysis of IsoLGs formed during oxidation of 1-palmitoyl, 2-arachidonoyl-3-glycero-phosphocholine (data not shown). Additional studies were then undertaken to confirm the identity of these compounds as IsoLGs. When analyzed as a [2H3]O-methoxylamine derivative, all of the m/z 481 peaks shifted upwards 6 Da tom/z 487, indicating the presence of two carbonyl groups. When analyzed as a [2H9]TMS ether derivative, all of the m/z 481 peaks shifted upward 9 Da tom/z 490, indicating the presence of one hydroxyl group (data not shown). These compounds were then analyzed by GC/EI/MS after partial purification by HPLC. Mass spectra were obtained that were consistent with the formation of both E2- and D2-IsoLGs. One of the mass spectra obtained is shown in Fig. 3A. Although it is unlikely that this is a mass spectrum of a single IsoLG isomer because the preparation analyzed was only partially purified, this mass spectrum is consistent with a major component being a 15-series IsoLGD2 compound. The spectrum is characterized by an intense molecular ion at m/z 662 and intense ions atm/z 631 (M − 31), loss of ⋅OCH3from a methoxime group, m/z 591 (M − 71), loss of⋅CH2(CH2)3CH3from fragmentation between C-15 and C-16 on the lower side chain,m/z 559 (M − 71 − 32), the loss of⋅CH2(CH2)3CH3 + HOCH3, m/z 541(M − 90 − 31), loss of Me3SiOH + ⋅OCH3, m/z 501 (M − 90 − 71), loss of Me3SiOH +⋅CH2(CH2)3CH3,m/z 489 (M − 173), loss of ⋅CH2(OSiMe3)(CH2)4CH3 from fragmentation between C-14 and C-15 on the lower side chain. A mass spectrum of authentic LGE2 is shown in Fig. 3B. Notable are the striking similarities in the high mass ions present and their relative abundances in the spectra in Fig. 3, A and B. The presence of ions involving the loss of 71 and 173 Da in both mass spectra resulting from fragmentation adjacent to the carbon on the lower side chain on which the TMS ether group is attached supports the identity of a major component of the mass spectrum in Fig. 3A as a 15-series IsoLG. An ion at m/z 418 is present in both the IsoLG and LGE2 spectra, but its origin is unclear; it may derive from a minor common decomposition product. Intense fragmentation ions are present in the mass spectrum of authentic LGE2 resulting from fragmentation between C-8 and C-12, one representing the upper portion of the molecule (m/z 392) and one representing the lower portion of the molecule (m/z 270). These ions are also observed in the IsoLG spectrum, indicating that it may also contain a 15-series IsoLGE2 compound as a minor component. The base ion in the mass spectrum in Fig. 3A is m/z 284. This origin of this ion would be consistent with the lower portion of a 15-series IsoLGD2 molecule, as a result of fragmentation between C-8 and C-12. However, unlike the mass spectrum of authentic LGE2, an ion representing the upper portion of the molecule is not present. Possible reasons for this include different relative abundances of these two ions in different IsoLG isomers or in LGDversus LGE compounds. The latter possibility cannot be explored because authentic LGD2 is not available. Salomon and colleagues have attempted the synthesis of LGD2 but found it to be highly unstable under the conditions used for its synthesis (12Iyer R.S. Miller D.B. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3171-3180Google Scholar). To evaluate the quantitative relevance of the formation of IsoLGs, we compared the amounts of IsoLGs with the amounts of F2-IsoPs and E2/D2-IsoPs formed during oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro.Surprisingly, we found that the amounts of IsoLGs formed were approximately equivalent with the amounts of F2-IsoPs and were only slightly less than the amounts of E2/D2-IsoPs (Fig. 4). These data suggest strongly that IsoLGs can be produced as products of the IsoP pathway at levels that can potentially have significant biological impact. Having established that IsoLGs can be formed in significant amounts during oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro, we explored whether we could detect their formation in a number of biological systemsin vitro and in vivo. Despite the fact that readily detectable levels of F2-IsoPs are present in less than 1 ml of normal human plasma and urine, we could not detect IsoLGs in 3 ml of either human plasma or urine. Furthermore, we could not detect the formation of IsoLGs in vivo in 1 g of liver from rats treated with CCl4 to induce an intense oxidant injury to the liver which was associated with a marked increase in the formation of F2-IsoPs. We also could not detect the formation of IsoLGs in vitro following (a) iron/ADP/ascorbate-induced oxidation of liver microsomes (17Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Daniel V.D. Awad J.A. Mirochnitchenko O. Swift L.L. Burk R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) prepared from 5 g of rat liver or (b) following copper-mediated oxidation of LDL (18Lynch S.M. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Frei B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) isolated from 2.5 ml of plasma, both of which again were accompanied by marked increases in F2-IsoP formation. The overriding difference between these experiments and those in which we oxidized arachidonic acid in vitro is the presence of protein. We hypothesized that the failure to detect IsoLGs in these biological systems may be attributed to extremely rapid adduction of IsoLGs to proteins. Thus, we attempted to intercept the formation of IsoLG adducts in the microsome and LDL oxidation mixtures by adding oxime reagents to a final concentration of 3% to derivatize the carbonyls, which would prevent IsoLG adduction to amines. Although this approach effectively converted the carbonyls of E2/D2-IsoPs that were formed in these experiments to oxime derivatives, it did not successfully trap free IsoLGs. This suggested either that IsoLGs were not formed or that under the experimental conditions used, their reaction with proteins was much faster than their reaction with the oxime reagents. In an attempt to gain support for our hypothesis that IsoLGs could not be detected as free dicarbonyl compounds in biological systems because they adduct to proteins with extreme rapidity, we compared the rate of adduction of LGE2 and 4-HNE with BSA, as a model protein. We thought a comparison of the rate of adduction of LGE2with that of 4-HNE would be informative because 4-HNE, although considered to be one of the most highly reactive products of lipid peroxidation yet identified, can be detected in free form in biological systems (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5902) Google Scholar). The rate of adduction of these two compounds was assessed by monitoring the decline in levels of free compounds measured in aliquots removed at various times during incubations consisting of LGE2 or 4-HNE with a 3 molar excess of BSA. As shown in Fig. 5, levels of free LGE2dropped precipitously during the initial 60 s of the incubation; notably more than 50% had adducted within 20 s. Of note, free LGE2 did not decline completely to undetectable levels but leveled off between 5 and 10% of the amount detected at time 0. This can likely be attributed to facile migration of the Δ13double bond to the Δ12 position, which may decrease the reactivity of the molecule (12Iyer R.S. Miller D.B. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3171-3180Google Scholar). A small amount of Δ12–LGE2 may have been present in the synthetic preparation, or migrati"
https://openalex.org/W2003940624,"The mammalian dual-specificity protein-tyrosine phosphatase VHR (forVH1-related) has been identified as a novel regulator of extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs). To identify potential cellular substrates of VHR, covalently immobilized mutant VHR protein was employed as an affinity trap. A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein(s) of ∼42 kDa was specifically adsorbed by the affinity column and identified as ERK1 and ERK2. Subsequent kinetic analyses and transfection studies demonstrated that VHR specifically dephosphorylates and inactivates ERK1 and ERK2 in vitro and in vivo. Only the native structure of phosphorylated ERK was recognized by VHR and was inactivated with a second-order rate constant of 40,000 m−1 s−1. VHR was found to dephosphorylate endogenous ERK, but not p38 and JNK. Immunodepletion of endogenous VHR eliminated the dephosphorylation of cellular ERK. Transfection studies in COS-1 cells demonstrated thatin vivo phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor-stimulated ERK depended on VHR protein levels. Overexpression above endogenous levels of VHR led to accelerated ERK inactivation, but did not alter the normal activation of ERK. Unique among reported mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatases, VHR is constitutively expressed, localized to the nucleus, and tyrosine-specific. This study is the first to report the identification of authentic substrates of dual-specificity phosphatases utilizing affinity absorbents and is the first to identify a nuclear, constitutively expressed, and tyrosine-specific ERK phosphatase.

The data strongly suggest that VHR is responsible for the rapid inactivation of ERK following stimulation and for its repression in quiescent cells. The dual-specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases (DS-PTPs) 1The abbreviation used is: DS-PTP, dual-specificity protein-tyrosine phosphatase; MAP, mitogen-actived protein; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; rAb, rabbit antibody; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. are members of a large family of enzymes that catalyze the phosphomonoester hydrolysis of protein substrates (1Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The DS-PTPs were identified as protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that are capable of efficiently hydrolyzing phosphotyrosine as well as phosphothreonine/serine residues. Approximately 15–20 distinct DS-PTPs have been identified to date. The first identified DS-PTP (VH1, for vaccinia open reading frame H1) was discovered in the H1 open reading frame of vaccinia virus (2Guan K.L. Broyles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and was later found to be an essential gene in the poxvirus (3Liu K. Lemon B. Traktman P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7823-7834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently discovered DS-PTPs have been suggested to play a central role in the regulation of the cell cycle and signaling pathways mediated by the families of MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinases (4Keyse S.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The MAP kinases facilitate intracellular signaling events triggered by mitogens, growth factors, and stress that result in cellular growth, differentiation, and death (5Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 6Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). The MAP kinases are activated by their specific upstream dual-specificity kinases (MAP-kinase kinases) through phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine residues in the TXY motif. In response to extracellular stimuli, activated MAP kinases then phosphorylate an array of cellular substrates, including nuclear transcription factors. In mammals, three distinct MAP kinase families have been identified. Members of one family, ERK1 and ERK2, are primarily activated by growth and differentiation factors as well as by phorbol esters (7Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). The JNK family (or SAPK) and p38 MAP kinase family are activated by proinflamatory cytokines and environmental stress. Several DS-PTPs have been implicated in ERK regulation by dephosphorylation of both Thr183 and Tyr185(8Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

All of the MKPs identified to date, with the exception of Pyst1, are immediate-early genes that are induced by various mitogens, growth factors, and stresses. The induction of MKPs by distinct stimuli and their cell-specific expression suggest that there is a great diversity in the function of the various MKPs. For example, MKP-1 is induced by stress, mitogens, and phorbol esters and is localized to the nucleus (8Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), MKPs are not expressed in quiescent cells (29Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and disruption of themkp-1 gene does not affect mouse development and normal MAP kinase activity was observed in MKP-1-deficient fibroblasts (30Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations argue that a phosphatase(s) distinct from the MKPs is responsible for the rapid down-regulation of ERK. It has been suggested that a constitutively expressed phosphatase is directly involved in ERK1 and ERK2 inactivation. In rat mesangial cells, sustained ERK2 activation by endothelin and EGF was regulated by a vanadate-sensitive protein phosphatase but not by a transcriptionally regulated protein (20Schramek H. Schumacher M. Pfaller W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F423-F432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid inactivation of ERK2 in 3T3-L1, PC12, and PAE cells was attributed to the serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2A and an unknown PTP distinct from MKP-1 (22Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide failed to affect the inactivation of MAP kinase following induction with EGF in A431 and PC12 cells (21Chajry N. Martin P.M. Cochet C. Berthois Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Wu J. Lau L.F. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that MKPs are not involved. Others have proposed that a vanadate-sensitive and tyrosine-specific phosphatase is responsible for the repression of ERK1 and ERK2 activity in the absence of serum and that a tyrosine phosphatase regulates ERK1 and ERK2 activity in cells transformed by upstream oncoproteins (19Gopalbhai K. Meloche S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have utilized affinity trapping methods to identify potential cellular substrates of the mammalian VHR phosphatase (for VH1-related), a putative dual-specificity PTP that was previously identified by an expression cloning strategy (31Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The physiological function has been uncertain since no in vivo substrates had been identified. The D92A catalytic mutant of VHR was covalently coupled to a solid matrix which then served as an affinity absorbent for specific tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from hydrogen peroxide-stimulated COS1 cells. We selected hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a mitogen for two main reasons. We have previously demonstrated that H2O2 will rapidly and reversible inactivate VHR and other PTPs by selectively oxidizing the catalytic cysteine thiolate (37Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Knowing that endogenous VHR is highly expressed in COS-1 cells, we surmised that treatment with H2O2 would inactivate the endogenous VHR, leading to increased phosphorylation of its authentic protein substrate(s). Extracts from H2O2-treated COS-1 cells would then provide an enriched fraction of the physiological substrate. Moreover, reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 have been shown to stimulate increases in relevant cellular tyrosine phosphorylation (38Monteiro H.P. Stern A.

Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar), perhaps as a second messenger. Potent activation of extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) is observed with H2O2 treatment (46Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

The phosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2 were specifically retained and eluted from the VHR affinity columns. Kinetic and cellular expression studies further demonstrated that ERK1 and ERK2 are authentic in vitro and in vivo substrates for VHR. Our data suggest that VHR is a constitutively expressed and tyrosine-specific phosphatase localized to the nucleus and is responsible for the repression of ERK1 and ERK2 in quiescent cells and for their rapid inactivation following stimulation. Full-length cDNA fragments of VHR or C124S mutant were cloned out of pT7-7-VHR (32Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the BamHI (5′ end) and EcoRI (3′ end) sites of pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3-VHR and pcDNA3-C124S, respectively. Both constructs direct the expression of all 185 amino acids, with no vector added sequences. Antisense VHR construct (pcDNA3-anti-VHR) was generated by removing the XbaI and EcoRI insert from pT7-7-VHR and inserting into theXbaI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3. The D92A mutant was generated using the Bio-Rad Muta-gene method as described previously (35Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recombinant ERK2 was purified and phosphorylated by recombinant MEK1 mutant G7B (50Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuura J.E. Manning M.C. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The c-myc-ERK2 pcEXV-n plasmid was a gift from Dr. Phil Stork (14Hirsch D.D. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4568-4575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to VHR were immunopurified from the serum of VHR-(full-length) immunized rabbits (Cocalico). Chicken immunopurified anti-VHR antibody was generated by immunizing chickens with the full-length VHR protein. The IgY fraction was purified from egg yolks (Aves Labs). Both VHR antibodies were affinity purified over a column containing recombinant VHR conjugated to Affi-Gel 10. Chicken antibodies were eluted with 0.1 msodium phosphate (pH 2.5) and stored in PBS. Rabbit antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 2.5) and stored in PBS. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membrane at 125 V for 45 min. Membranes were rinsed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) then blocked with TBST containing either 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) or non-fat dry milk for 1 h at 25 °C. Blots were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST containing either 3% BSA or non-fat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. The blots were then rinsed with TBST (3 times) for 5 min at 25 °C and incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody diluted in TBST containing either 3% BSA or 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at 25 °C. The blots were rinsed another 3 times for 5 min with TBST before detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Blots were stripped by incubating in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 6.7) for 30 min at 50 °C. Stripped blots were then rinsed extensively with TBST and reprobed as described above. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antibody (rAb) specific to p44/42 MAPK (New England Biolabs), rAb specific to the phosphorylated forms of p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) and p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) (New England Biolabs), rAb specific to the phosphorylated forms of SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) (Promega), rAb specific to VHR that was immunopurified from the serum of VHR-(full-length) immunized rabbits (Cocalico), mouse monoclonal antibody specific to anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) (Upstate Biotechnology), monoclonal antibody-agarose conjugated and unconjugated specific to c-Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad), and horse anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (New England Biolabs). Human VHR (C124S and D92A) proteins were bacterially expressed and purified as described (35Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Affi-Gel 10 (2 ml) was washed 5 times with ice-cold 50 mm MES (pH 7.0) and incubated with 2 ml of 0.5 mg/ml D92A or C124S VHR for 1 h at 4 °C. Unreacted activated esters were capped with 200 μl of 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.0) for 1 h at 4 °C and the coupled resin was washed extensively with 50 mm Bis-Tris, 50 mm NaCl (pH 6.5) (wash buffer). Alternatively, Affi-Gel 10 was washed and capped as above without protein coupling. COS-1 cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in 150-mm plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing low glucose, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin at 1000 units/ml, and streptomycin at 1000 μg/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.) (growth media). Cells were then treated with 200 μm H2O2 for 40 min at 37 °C. After treatment, cells were rinsed once with 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2), harvested, and frozen at −20 °C. When needed, cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Bis-Tris, 50 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) (pH 6.5), sonicated for 30 s on ice, Dounce homogenized for 15 strokes, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Clarified extract was applied to the affinity column, attached to a Beckman BioSys 510 liquid chromatography system running at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with wash buffer (3 × column volumes) and retained phosphoproteins were eluted with 10 ml of 0.2 mm sodium arsenate. The eluant was collected and the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, ERK, and phosphorylated ERK were measured by Western blot analysis. COS-1 cells were seeded at 1.0 × 106 in 100-mm plates and grown for 16–24 h. LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) (30 μl) and purified plasmid DNA (at 5 μg of c-myc-ERK and 1 μg all others) were combined in 500 μl of Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. The cells were rinsed once with Opti-MEM I and the Lipid/DNA solution was added dropwise to the cells which were then covered with Opti-MEM I (5 ml). After 6–8 h, transfected cells were placed in growth media for 16–24 h. Cells were then serum starved and left for 16–24 h before treatment with 100 nm EGF (Collaborative Biomedical Products) for 15 min at 37 °C. After treatment, cells were rinsed once with PBS, lysed with 500 μl of ice-cold 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, sonicated on ice for 30 s, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford. Immunoprecipitation of c-myc-ERK was then performed on 500 ng of cell lysate using 10 μl of the agarose-conjugated mAb (9E10) specific to c-Myc in a total volume of 1 ml for 2 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads were washed twice with 500 μl of 50 mmTris, 0.5 m NaCl, 5% sucrose, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (pH 7.3) for 2 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 2 × Laemmli buffer. Cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells per well in two-well chamber slides and grown for 24 h. The cells were then rinsed twice with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at 25 °C, rinsed 3 times with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% BSA (I.F. wash solution), blocked and lysed with PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 3% BSA, rinsed 3 times with I.F. wash solution, and incubated with the rAb specific to VHR diluted 1:500 in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% BSA (antibody dilution solution) for 1 h at 25 °C. The cells were then rinsed with I.F. wash solution 5 times, incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 488-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:400 in antibody dilution solution, rinsed 5 times with I.F. wash solution, and mounted with 50% glycerol, 0.2% p-phenylenediamine. Cells were viewed using a Leica DMRB microscope with a 63X PL APO objective. As a control, recombinant VHR was first preabsorbed to the primary antibody and the immunofluorescence staining determined as described above. Serum-starved COS-1 cells were treated with 200 μmH2O2 for 40 min at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed in PBS, harvested, and lysed as described above. Recombinant VHR, or an equal volume of buffer, was added to a final effective concentration of 0–0.16 μm and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 5 × Laemmli sample buffer containing SDS and subjected to Western analysis. Recombinant VHR, or an equal volume of buffer, at a final effective concentration of 0.1 μm was combined with 2.5 μmrecombinant phosphorylated ERK2 in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm Bis-Tris, 100 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% BSA (pH 7.0) and incubated for up to 40 min at 25 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at the times indicated and the reactions were terminated by adding 5 × Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to Western analysis to examine the phosphorylation state of ERK using the phospho-ERK antibody. Changes in the phosphorylation of ERK were quantified by densitometry using Bio-Rad GS-700 Imaging Densitometer and the Molecular Analyst Software. The identical samples were also coupled to a kinase assay to directly examine the effect of VHR on the activity of phosphorylated ERK2. Aliquots were withdrawn at the same times as above, mixed with"
https://openalex.org/W2012052743,"ATP is released from neurons and other cell types during several physiological and stress conditions under which it exerts various biological effects upon binding to purinoreceptors. A rather peculiar purinoreceptor called P2X7/P2Z is expressed on microglial and other myeloic cells. Although increasing evidence implicates an important role for P2Z in inflammatory processes, little information exists about underlying signaling pathways. Here, we report that in N9 microglial cells, extracellular ATP potently activates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a central transcription factor involved in cytokine gene expression. ATP activated NFAT rapidly (within 1 min), whereas activation of nuclear factor κB was much delayed, with strikingly distinct kinetics. During ATP stimulation, both NFAT-1 and NFAT-2 were activated by a calcineurin-dependent pathway that required the influx of extracellular calcium ions. Based on the pharmacological profile, NFAT activation was specifically mediated by P2Z and not by other purinoreceptors. N9 cells that lacked P2Z but still expressed P2Y purinoreceptors failed to respond to NFAT activation. We conclude that P2Z-mediated NFAT activation may represent a novel mechanism by which extracellular ATP can modulate early inflammatory gene expression within the nervous and immune system.

Large amounts of ATP and other nucleotides can be rapidly released from different cellular sources such as nerve terminals, antigen-stimulated T cells, activated platelets, endothelial cells, and other cell types under either physiological and pathological conditions such as hypoxia, stress, and tissue damage. Particularly in the immune and nervous system, extracellular ATP serves as a mediator of cell-to-cell communication by triggering a variety of biological responses including excitatory transmitter function, mitogenic stimulation, or induction of cell death (reviewed in Refs. 1Dubyak G.R.

El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol.

At least two mechanistically distinct subclasses of P2 purinoreceptors are currently known. The metabotrophic P2Y receptors (formerly P2u, P2t, and P2y), which bind either UTP or ATP, initiate their biological effects through the G-protein-coupled activation of phospholipase C and subsequent Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. The P2X receptors are a distinct subfamily of receptors that are related to glutamate receptors and function as ligand-gated ion channels. Engagement of P2X receptors by ATP causes an increase in Ca2+ permeability that is entirely dependent upon extracellular Ca2+ ions. Recently, among the P2X subfamily, the molecular structure of the P2Z receptor, also called P2X7, has been elucidated (6Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 7Rassendren F. Buell G.N. Virginio C. Collo G. North A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5482-5486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The P2Z receptor contains two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop, structural features that are characteristic of members of the P2X family. Unlike other P2X receptors, the P2Z receptor has an unusually long C-terminal domain that does not contain any known signaling motifs. P2Z receptor expression appears to be rather restricted to myeloic cells such as dendritic cells, mature macrophages, mast cells, and microglial cells (reviewed in Refs. 8Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 116: 524-528Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (352) Google Scholar and 9Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Ferrari D. Sanz J. Venketaraman V. Baricordi O.R. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The receptor is not expressed on monocytes but is induced by γ-interferon and during monocyte differentiation (10Hickman S.E. El Khoury J. Greenberg S. Schieren I. Silverstein S.C.

Invest. 1995; 95: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A unique response of the P2Z receptor is the formation of a large transmembrane pore permeable to hydrophilic molecules of up to 900 Da in size, which is formed by the ATP-induced aggregation of receptor subunits. There is increasing evidence for a functional role of the P2Z receptor in immune reactions (8Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 116: 524-528Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 9Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Ferrari D. Sanz J. Venketaraman V. Baricordi O.R. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Continuous activation of the receptor and pore formation cause perturbations of ion homeostasis that may finally lead to cell death. Interestingly, it has been found that, in contrast to several other cell death inducers, only P2Z receptor ligation killed mycobacteria within BCG-infected macrophages (12Molloy A.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It has been also postulated that P2Z receptor ligation is responsible for the formation of multinucleated giant cells during inflammatory granulomatous reactions (14Chiozzi P. Sanz J.M. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Aleotti A. Buell G.N. Collo G. Di Virgilio F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages and microglial cells, stimulation of the P2Z receptor induces the immediate release of interleukin (IL) 1The abbreviation used is: IL, interleukin; CsA, cyclosporin A; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; TBE, 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3. 1β, which is probably mediated by the activation of IL-1β-converting enzyme (15Perregaux D.

Despite this accumulating evidence for an important function of the P2Z receptor in inflammatory processes, signaling events underlying these biological effects are almost entirely unknown. We have recently shown that P2Z receptor ligation causes a rather unusual delayed and sustained activation of the transcription factor NFκB (19Ferrari D. Wesselborg S. Bauer K.A.M. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Important transcriptional regulators, which weakly resemble NFκB in their DNA binding domain, comprise proteins of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family (reviewed in Refs.20Crabtree G.R.

NFAT proteins play an important role in inducible gene transcription by controlling the expression of several cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor, CD40 ligand, and CD95 ligand (21Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 22Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

To date, the cDNAs of four different genes belonging to the NFAT family have been described encoding NFAT-1 (NFATp) (23McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E.

NFAT proteins show different tissue distribution and inducibility upon cell stimulation, raising the possibility that their functions may be distinct. In addition, some NFAT members are synthesized as multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, translation initiation, and polyadenylation events (28Park J. Takeuchi A. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20914-20921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell.

The signaling mechanisms of NFAT have been most intensively studied in T- and B-lymphocytes, but there is a paucity of information on their role in other cell types. The NFAT complex is composed of a cytoplasmic subunit whose subcellular localization and DNA binding activity is controlled by Ca2+ mobilization. Nuclear translocation of NFAT is regulated by the Ca2+-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin, which is the target for the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 (31Liu J. Farmer J. Lane W. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3620) Google Scholar, 32Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

After nuclear translocation, NFAT may couple to activator protein 1 (AP-1) or other transcription factors, resulting in the coordinate induction of proinflammatory cytokine expression (35Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 36Boise L.H. Petryniak B. Mao X. June C.H. Wang C.Y. Lindsten T. Bravo R. Kovary K. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the expression and mechanism of NFAT activation in microglial cells, which are considered to be important immune effector cells of the brain (37Gehrmann J. Matsumoto Y. Kreutzberg G.W. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 20: 269-287Crossref Scopus (970) Google Scholar). It is shown that extracellular ATP instantly induced the nuclear translocation of both NFAT-1 and NFAT-2 by a calcineurin-dependent mechanism. This effect required the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and was exclusively mediated by the P2Z and not by other P2 purinoreceptors. P2Z receptor-mediated NFAT activation may therefore represent a heretofore unappreciated mechanism by which extracellular ATP can modulate inflammatory processes within the nervous and other cellular systems. The mouse microglial cell line N9 has been described previously (38Righi M. Mori L. De Libero G. Sironi M. Biondi A. Mantovani A. Denis-Donini S. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1443-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli (University of Milan, Milan, Italy). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine and routinely passaged by trypsinization. ATP and other nucleotides were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Periodate-oxidized ATP was a kind gift of Drs. S. Hanau and F. Di Virgilio (University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy) and was synthesized as described previously (39Murgia M. Hanau S. Pizzo P. Rippa M. Di Virgilio F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8199-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FK506 and cyclosporin A (CsA) were obtained from the clinical pharmacy (Medical Clinics, Tübingen, Germany). The anti-mouse NFAT-1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and the anti-NFAT-2 antibody (clone 7A6) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (Grünberg, Germany). For detection of NFAT-3, different rabbit antisera raised against residues 886–902 or residues 614–632 of human NFAT-3 (Ref. 29Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr. N. R. Rice (National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD)) and a serum directed against residues 387–406 of human NFAT-3 (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany) were used. For NFAT-4, an antiserum raised against residues 130–149 of human NFAT-4 (Ref. 29Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar; a kind gift from Dr. N. R. Rice) and a serum directed against mouse NFAT-4 (kindly provided by Drs. A. Avots and E. Serfling (University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany)) were used. An anti-c-Fos antiserum was obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). N9 cells (2 × 106) were plated in 6-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated with the indicated stimuli. Pretreatment with CsA was performed for 15 min, and pretreatment with FK506 was performed for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspending phosphate-buffered saline-washed cells in 150 μl of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). After a 20-min incubation on ice, cells were lysed by passing them three times through a G20 needle. The samples were then centrifuged, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 70 μl of Buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). After centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min, nuclear extracts were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of the nuclear extracts (4 μg of protein) were incubated with the32P-labeled NFAT-specific oligonucleotide. Binding reactions were performed in a 24 μl volume containing 4 μl of extract, 4 μl of 5× binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 20% Ficoll), 1 μg poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor DNA, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 40,000 cpm (Cerenkov) of the labeled oligonucleotide. After a 20-min binding reaction at 4 °C, samples were loaded on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel that was pre-run for 4 h at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE. After electrophoresis, gels were dried under a gel dryer and exposed to an x-ray film. The NFAT-binding oligonucleotide corresponding to the distal NFAT motif from the murine IL-2 promoter (5′-TCGACAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATACAGAAG-3′) was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham-Buchler) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by P-10 gel filtration (Bio-Rad) to remove nonincorporated radioactivity. A cold oligonucleotide mutated in the core NFAT recognition sequence (5′-TCGACAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTATATCAGAAG-3′) was used for competition experiments (35Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). When supershift analysis was performed, nuclear extracts were preincubated with the antibodies for 30 min on ice. After the indicated treatments, nuclear extracts were prepared from 2 × 106 cells and loaded on an 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Subsequently, separated proteins were electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham-Buchler). The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk powder in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with different NFAT-specific antibodies. Membranes were washed four times with Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween-20 and incubated with the respective peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified secondary antibody for 1 h. After extensive washing, the reaction was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence staining using ECL reagents (Amersham-Buchler). Incubation of N9 mouse microglial cells with extracellular ATP elicits a rapid increase in the intracellular Ca2+concentration mediated by both the P2Z and P2Y receptors expressed in these cells (17Ferrari D. Villalba M. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1531-1539PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas stimulation of P2Y receptors causes a transient Ca2+ increase mainly from intracellular stores, activation of the P2Z receptor involves a long-lasting Ca2+influx across the plasma membrane. Because an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations is required to activate the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin that binds and dephosphorylates NFAT, we investigated the effect of extracellular ATP on NFAT activation in N9 cells. Until now, NFAT expression and activation have not been studied in microglial cells. In Fig. 1, we compared the effects of different agents leading to the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ ions. N9 cells were stimulated with ATP, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase. After stimulation, nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed for NFAT activation by EMSA. Treating cells with ATP potently induced NFAT activation, which was similar to the effect elicited by A23187 and thapsigargin. We have previously demonstrated that ATP stimulation of the P2Z receptor can activate transcription factor NFκB (19Ferrari D. Wesselborg S. Bauer K.A.M. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, microglial cells were stimulated with 3 mm ATP for different times, and then identical nuclear extracts were analyzed for the activation of NFκB and NFAT. The activation of NFAT was already detectable after 1 min of ATP stimulation, reached a maximum after 15 min, and strongly decreased after 60 min. In contrast, activation of NFκB was much delayed and sustained. Strong activation of NFκB was not detectable before 3 h of stimulation, but it was still maintained after 6 h. These results indicate that ATP stimulation of N9 cells activates both transcription factors, but with a strikingly opposite time dependence. Because different members of the purinoreceptor subfamilies exhibit distinct affinities for ATP, we determined the dose dependence of ATP-induced NFAT activation. As shown in Fig. 3, NFAT activation became visible after cells were incubated with 1 mm ATP. Maximal NFAT activation was obtained with 3 mm ATP, whereas a higher concentration of 5 mm was less effective. This dose dependence corresponds to other effects of P2Z purinoreceptor signal transduction in N9 cells (17Ferrari D. Villalba M. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1531-1539PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse macrophages (18Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Hanau S. Di Virgilio F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Because N9 cells express both P2Y and P2Z purinoreceptors, we further tried to specify the receptor subtype involved by using different nucleotides and pharmacological ATP analogues. In addition to ATP, benzoylbenzoic ATP, which is a more potent agonist for the P2Z receptor than ATP, was able to induce NFAT activation, even at a concentration of 1 mm (Fig. 4A). In contrast, other nucleotides such as ADP, GTP, or CTP, which are not agonists of the P2Z receptor, did not induce NFAT activation. Remarkably, UTP, which also ligates P2Y receptors, failed to activate NFAT, suggesting that NFAT activation was specifically mediated by the P2Z receptor. Results similar to those of EMSAs were obtained by Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts using an anti-NFAT-1 antibody. Fig. 4B demonstrates that ATP as well as benzoylbenzoic ATP induced the translocation of a protein of approximately 120 kDa, corresponding to the molecular size of NFAT-1, into the cell nucleus. NFAT-1, in contrast, was not detectable in nuclear extracts of cells treated with UTP and other nucleotides. The selective involvement of the P2Z receptor in ATP-induced NFAT activation was further supported by additional experiments. P2Z receptor-mediated effects have been shown to be antagonized by oxidized ATP that covalently binds and inhibits the receptor (39Murgia M. Hanau S. Pizzo P. Rippa M. Di Virgilio F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8199-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells with 300 μm oxidized ATP completely abolished ATP-induced NFAT activation (Fig. 5A). In contrast, oxidized ATP did not inhibit NFAT activation in response to the Ca2+ionophore A23187, demonstrating that it did not interfere with the intracellular signaling of NFAT dephosphorylation and translocation. We also investigated the effect of NFAT activation in N9 derivative cells that lack the P2Z receptor but still express P2Y purinoreceptors (17Ferrari D. Villalba M. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1531-1539PubMed Google Scholar,41Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Dal Susino M. Collo G. Di Virgilio F. J. Neuropharmacol. 1997; 36: 1295-1301Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, NFAT activation was almost not inducible by ATP in clone N9R17, whereas a Ca2+ ionophore strongly activated the transcription factor. The immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506 prevent NFAT activation by inhibiting the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin that dephosphorylates NFAT and allows the nuclear translocation of NFAT. As shown in Fig. 6A, pretreatment of N9 cells with CsA or FK506 was able to prevent NFAT binding to DNA in ATP-stimulated cells. Essentially the same results were demonstrated by the absence of an anti-NFAT-1 immunoreactive protein in the nuclear extracts of cells pretreated with immunosuppressive drugs (Fig. 6B). The results therefore indicate that ATP-triggered NFAT translocation and DNA binding are calcineurin-dependent processes. A common intracellular event triggered by antigen-stimulated receptors such as the T- and B-cell receptors is an increase in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, leading to calcineurin and subsequent NFAT activation. To investigate whether Ca2+ was essential for ATP-induced NFAT activation, N9 cells were stimulated with the nucleotide in the presence of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. Pretreatment of cells with 2 mm EGTA completely prevented NFAT DNA binding as well as the nuclear translocation of NFAT-1, indicating that activation of the transcription factor required extracellular Ca2+. These data concur with the above experiments, demonstrating that P2Y receptors, which mediate a transient Ca2+ increase from intracellular stores, were unable to activate NFAT. Therefore, in microglial cells, ATP-induced activation of NFAT required a sustained increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which is exclusively triggered by the P2Z receptor. Among the NFAT family, four different genes encoding NFAT-1, NFAT-2, NFAT-3, and NFAT-4 have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 22Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Although all members exhibit similar DNA binding specificity, they differ in their tissue distribution and inducibility upon cell stimulation, suggesting that each protein may serve specific functions. Whereas NFAT-1 is constitutively expressed in lymphocytes and in several non-lymphoid cells, NFAT-2 expression has been reported to be induced in activated T and B cells (24Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 42Venkataraman L. Francis D.A. Wang Z. Liu J. Rothstein T.R. Sen R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To analyze specificity and investigate which NFAT member contributes to the ATP-induced DNA complex, we performed competition and supershift analyses. In these experiments, higher resolution gels were used that could separate two ATP-induced DNA complexes. Both DNA complexes were efficiently competed by an excess of the NFAT-binding oligonucleotide, whereas an oligonucleotide mutated in the NFAT recognition sequence did not markedly affect NFAT DNA binding (Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7B, an antibody against NFAT-1 reduced and supershifted the ATP-triggered DNA-protein complexes. Formation of the NFAT-specific complex, in particular, the lower DNA complex, was also inhibited by anti-NFAT-2, whereas no immunoreactivity was observed using a panel of antisera directed against different epitopes of either NFAT-3 or NFAT-4. In addition, most of the induced DNA complexes were inhibited and supershifted by a combination of anti-NFAT-1 and anti-NFAT-2. Because transcription factor AP-1 can associate with NFAT, we also used an anti-c-Fos antibody that supershifted the upper ATP-induced DNA complex (Fig. 7B). The activation of NFAT-1 and NFAT-2 by ATP was confirmed by Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from ATP-stimulated cells. After ATP stimulation, anti-NFAT-1 detected a nuclear protein of approximately 120 kDa that was absent in nuclear extracts from control cells (Fig. 7C). Anti-NFAT-2 recognized a prominent protein doublet band of approximately 90 kDa, similar in size to the short NFAT-2 isoform described previously (24Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J.

In contrast, we could not detect the expression and nuclear translocation of NFAT-3 or NFAT-4 in immunoblot analyses using different antisera (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that microglial cells express and activate NFAT by the P2Z purinoreceptor that consists mainly of NFAT-1 and NFAT-2. In the present study, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP is a potent activator of the proinflammatory transcription factor NFAT in microglial cells. Using different pharmacological approaches and a receptor-deficient cell clone, evidence is provided that ATP-induced NFAT activation is selectively triggered by the P2Z receptor and not by other purinoreceptor subtypes. Because the P2Z receptor, but not P2Y receptors, induces a long-lasting transmembrane Ca2+influx, the data concur with our observation that ATP-induced NFAT activation is dependent on the cytoplasmic increase of extracellular Ca2+. The results therefore demonstrate a novel pathway by which extracellular ATP can modulate the activation of NFAT and subsequent proinflammatory processes. The P2Z receptor is attracting increasing interest due to its role in inflammatory reactions and the induction of cell death. Several reports have recently demonstrated that the P2Z receptor is a potent mediator of IL-1β release, most likely by the activation of IL-1β-converting enzyme that cleaves the IL-1β precursor to the mature cytokine (15Perregaux D. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15195-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Griffith R.J. Stam E.J. Downs J.T. Otterness I.G. J.

Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5627-5637PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently described that the P2Z receptor may also be involved in gene-regulatory events by activating transcription factor NFκB (19Ferrari D. Wesselborg S. Bauer K.A.M. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been found that extracellular ATP is involved in mitogenic stimulation of T-lymphocytes (44Baricordi O.R. Ferrari D. Melchiorri L. Chiozzi P. Hanau S. Chiari E. Rubini M. Di Virgilio F. Blood. 1996; 87: 682-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the purinoreceptor subtype involved in this effect has not been clearly defined, its pharmacological profile resembles that of the P2Z receptor. It is therefore tempting to speculate that ATP-triggered T-cell mitogenicity may involve NFAT activation and subsequent IL-2 expression. Both the NFAT and NFκB transcription factors are Ca2+-sensitive. Interestingly, activation of the two transcription factors occurred with strikingly different kinetics. NFAT DNA binding was visible within 1 min after ATP stimulation, whereas significant NFκB activation was not detectable before 3 h of stimulation, when NFAT activation had already declined. It can be presumed that the required amplitude and duration of Ca2+signals differ for the activation of NFκB and NFAT and may therefore contribute to this temporal transcriptional specificity of ATP stimulation. In this respect, it has been demonstrated that in B cells, a low sustained Ca2+ increase is sufficient for NFAT activation upon B-cell receptor ligation, whereas high levels of Ca2+ are required to activate NFκB (45Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 46Healy J. Dolmetsch R.E. Timmernan L.A. Cyster J.G. Thomas M.L. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 419-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Another reason for the different kinetic of activation of the two transcription factors could be that NFκB may not be activated by Ca2+alone but may require additional second messenger systems. Likely candidates in this respect are reactive oxygen intermediates, which are generated upon Ca2+ overload and other stress conditions (47Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar, 48Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Indeed, ATP-induced NFκB activation could be abolished by antioxidants in microglial cells (19Ferrari D. Wesselborg S. Bauer K.A.M. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Currently, there is very little information about the expression and role of NFAT within the brain. Our study shows for the first time that microglial cells, which are regarded as the principal immune effector cells of the brain (37Gehrmann J. Matsumoto Y. Kreutzberg G.W. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 20: 269-287Crossref Scopus (970) Google Scholar), may express both NFAT-1 and NFAT-2. Initially, it was reported that NFAT DNA binding activity could not be detected in crude brain extracts (49Verweij C.L. Guidos C. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15788-15795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, however, NFAT has been found in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells as well as in neurons within the olfactory bulb (50Ho A.M. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting to investigate whether extracellular ATP, which exerts excitatory transmitter function, activates NFAT in these cells. In lymphocytes, the expression of NFAT proteins is differentially regulated. Resting cells express only NFAT-1, whereas expression of NFAT-2 is induced to significant levels upon stimulation by Ca2+-dependent signaling (24Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 42Venkataraman L. Francis D.A. Wang Z. Liu J. Rothstein T.R. Sen R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, in normal lymphocytes, NFAT-3 is not expressed, and NFAT-4 is only detectable at low levels (29Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In microglial cells, we observed that NFAT-1 and NFAT-2 were activated and translocated to the nucleus with a similar rapid kinetic, suggesting that both proteins are constitutively expressed in these cells. Because we demonstrated NFAT activation in the N9 cell line, future experiments will have to investigate the regulation of NFAT proteins in primary microglial cells. We could not detect expression and activation of NFAT-3 or NFAT-4, whereas, similar to previous reports (32Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar, 35Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A.

Biol. 1993; 13: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), part of the ATP-induced NFAT complex was obviously associated with AP-1. The antiserum against murine NFAT-4 used in this study recognizes NFATx, the longest isoform of NFAT-4, and detects all isoforms of the protein. In addition, we used several antisera raised against different epitopes of human NFAT-3. Although we cannot completely exclude that the failure to detect NFAT-3 may be due to a lack of cross-reactivity with the murine protein, we consider it rather unlikely that NFAT-3 was activated in N9 cells. A combination of anti-NFAT-1 and anti-NFAT-2 strongly prevented DNA binding, indicating that the ATP-induced DNA complex predominantly consisted of NFAT-1 and NFAT-2. It can be presumed that microglial NFAT is involved in the inducible expression of proinflammatory cytokines. In this respect, it is known that activated microglia in inflammatory processes, Alzheimer's disease, and other forms of neurodegeneration are capable of producing high amounts of cytokines that have been implicated in disease progression (reviewed in Ref. 37Gehrmann J. Matsumoto Y. Kreutzberg G.W. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 20: 269-287Crossref Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Recent data further suggested that certain NFAT proteins play an important role exceeding their established immunoregulatory function in cytokine secretion. NFAT-2 and NFAT-3 have been implicated in heart development and cardiac hypertrophy (51Yoshida H. Nishina H. Takimoto H. Marengere L.E.M. Wakeham A.C. Bouchard D. Kong Y.-Y. Ohteki T. Shahinian A.

Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar), indicating a morphogenetic and developmental role of NFAT in some tissues. Future studies are required to investigate the functional role of NFAT expressed in microglial cells or other cells within the brain. In this study, we used microglial cells that have been previously characterized in detail for purinoreceptor expression (18Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Hanau S. Di Virgilio F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 40Greenberg S. Di Virgilio F. Steinberg T.H. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10337-10343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells are a good model, because they may be stimulated to produce cytokines by ATP from adjacent neurons. ATP has been convincingly shown to be physiologically released from neurons, where it is co-accumulated with acetylcholine and noradrenalin in adrenergic and cholinergic nerve terminals (53Zimmerman H. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 420-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 54Burnstock G. Wood J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 526-532Google Scholar). Collectively, the specific activation of NFAT through P2Z receptor ligation may represent a novel mechanism of how extracellular ATP may trigger inflammatory processes and exert neuroimmunomodulatory functions.

Both the RNP domain and the C terminus contribute to RNA binding. 3A. Nemeth, U. Kühn, and E. Wahle, unpublished data.3A. Nemeth, U. Kühn, and E. Wahle, unpublished data. A well known arginine-rich RNA binding domain is the RGG domain. The RGG motif is defined as a variable number of closely spaced Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) repeats interspersed with other, often aromatic amino acids (5Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar,6Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). RGG motifs are normally found in conjunction with RNP domains (7Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev.

It is possible that RGG motifs also confer specific RNA binding to a protein, since heterogeneous nuclear RNP, protein U has no other discernible RNA binding motif and can discriminate between different RNA sequences (5Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Other functions of the RGG domain thus far described include mediation of protein-protein interactions (14Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi M. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol.

A second mammalian methyltransferase termed PRMT3 has been cloned. Although this enzyme methylates a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing a glycine- and arginine-rich region from human fibrillarin, GST-GAR, no natural protein substrates have yet been identified for PRMT3 in heated hypomethylated rat cell extracts. PRMT3 is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas PRMT1 is largely confined to the nucleus (26Tang J. Gary J. Clarke S. Herschman H. J. Biol.

It is unclear which enzyme is responsible for the modification of this sequence in mammalian cells in vivo (see “Discussion”). In contrast, the yeast arginine methyltransferase Rmt1p is known to be responsible for arginine dimethylation in vivo (27Gary J. Lin W.-J. Yang M. Herschman H. Clarke S. J. Biol.

The biological function of arginine methylation is unknown. A role in signal transduction has been suggested (24Lin W.-J. Gary J. Yang M. Clarke S. Herschman H. J. Biol.

Upon amino acid analysis of PABP2 from calf thymus, only 50% of the expected arginine residues were found (4Nemeth A. Krause S. Blank D. Jenny A. Jenö P. Lustig A. Wahle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we show that arginine is methylated at 15 locations in PABP2. Almost all modified arginines are located in the C terminus of the protein in sequence motifs distinct from previously described sites of arginine methylation. The mammalian arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 and PRMT3 preferentially methylate the C terminus of recombinant PABP2 in vitro. PABP2 was purified from calf thymus as described (3Wahle E. Lustig A.

PABP2 used for enzymatic digests was further purified on a Nucleosil 500–5 C3-PPN HPLC column (150 × 2 mm) (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) equilibrated with 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted by a 30–60% solvent B (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) gradient over 25 min with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at 40 °C. The identity of the PABP2 peak was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the fraction was dried under a stream of nitrogen. Cysteine residues were alkylated with vinylpyridine as described (36Lee T.D. Shively J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The alkylated protein was desalted by HPLC and dried as above. GST-PRMT fusion proteins were purified as described (24Lin W.-J. Gary J. Yang M. Clarke S. Herschman H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). From this construct a fusion protein with the sequence Met-Ala-(His)6-PABP2 was expressed. Deletion mutants were obtained through polymerase chain reaction using pT7–7-PABP2 as a template and suitable oligonucleotide primers. PABP2 ΔC contained PABP2 amino acids 1 through 257, PABP2 ΔN amino acids 161 through 306, RNP domain amino acids 161 through 257, and the C-terminus amino acids 258 through 306. Polymerase chain reaction products were cut with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into pGM10(His)6 so that each protein was expressed with the N-terminal sequence Met-Ala-His6. Constructs were checked by sequencing. Proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21-pLys-S in Superbroth medium. 2-liter cultures with an A 600 of around 2 were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted, stored overnight at −80 °C, and suspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol). This and all subsequent buffers contained 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin. Lysates were prepared by sonication for 5 min, cleared by centrifugation, and incubated for 2 h with 1 ml nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The slurry was loaded into a column and washed with 10 ml of lysis buffer and then with 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. His6-tagged proteins were eluted with 5 × 1-ml fractions of lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. PABP2-containing fractions were dialyzed against 1 liter of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were loaded onto a Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in dialysis buffer and eluted with a 0–100% gradient of the same buffer containing 1 m KCl. PABP2-containing fractions were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The PABP2 C terminus was purified by Ni2+chelate chromatography under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing grade proteases were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Lys-C digestion of PABP2 was carried out in 50 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, with a Lys-C to PABP2 ratio of 1:200 (w/w) overnight at 37 °C. Digests were separated by HPLC as above with a 0–40% solvent B gradient over 60 min and a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at 40 °C. Fragments labeled Lys-C1–8 in the order of elution (Table I) were dried under a nitrogen stream and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Secondary chymotryptic digestion was carried out on Lys-C6 in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, with a chymotrypsin to protein ratio of around 1:100 (w/w) for 4 h at room temperature. Peptides were separated by HPLC and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Chymotryptic fragments are labeled Chym followed by the name of the digested substrate. Secondary tryptic digestion was carried out on Lys-C5b, Lys-C5c, and Lys-C8 in 100 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.5, with a trypsin to protein ratio of 1:20 (w/w). Complete digests were analyzed directly by MALDI-TOF-MS after 2 and 14 h of digestion. Trypsin fragments are labeled Tryp followed by the name of the digested substrate. Carboxypeptidase B type I diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Sigma) was purchased as a frozen solution. 1 μl of sample was incubated with 0.4 μl of a 1:1000 dilution (50 mmNH4HCO3 buffer) of the carboxypeptidase B stock solution for 1 h at room temperature.Table IOrigin, assignment, and mass of PABP2 proteolytic digestion fragmentsSampleObserved mass(es)amass of principal peak(s) [M+H]+.AssignmentPredicted massNotesLys-C1988.2Glu-138 –Lys-145988.5bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Fragment does not contain arginine.Lys-C21476.4Ala-124 –Lys-1351476.7bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Fragment contains two unmodified arginine residues.Lys-C31176.3Gly-214 –Lys-2231176.6bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Fragment does not contain arginine.Lys-C42227.8Gln-146 –Lys-1662227.1bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Fragment does not contain arginine.Lys-C5a2307.4Glu-224 –Lys-2432306.6caverage mass [M+H]+.Fragment contains three unmodified arginine residues.Lys-C5b2322.5Glu-224 –Lys-2432306.6caverage mass [M+H]+.Fragment + one methyl groupLys-C5c2336.2Glu-224 –Lys-2432306.6caverage mass [M+H]+.Fragment + two methyl groupsLys-C67378.5Arg-248 –Tyr-3067013.7caverage mass [M+H]+.C-terminal fragment + 26 methyl groupsLys-C74654.6Met-167 –Lys-2074654.2caverage mass [M+H]+.Fragment contains two unmodified arginine residuesdtwo cysteine residues present treated with 4-vinyl pyridene to form pyridylethyl cysteine..Lys-C811836.7Ac-Ala-2 –Lys-12311930.7caverage mass [M+H]+.N-terminal fragment − Met-1 + acetyl groupemodified residues not detectable under the bulk of unmodified material.Chym-Lys-C6 (a)1654.1Arg-294 –Tyr-3061570.8bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Fragment + six methyl groupsChym-Lys-C6 (b)3116.6Ser-282 –Tyr-3062947.7bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Fragment + 12 methyl groups, missed cleavage after Tyr-293Tryp-Lys-C5b1478.1Thr-228 –Arg-2401464.8bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Trypsin does not cleave at methylated Arg-238.Tryp-Lys-C5c1492.2Thr-228 –Arg-2401464.8bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Trypsin does not cleave at dimethylated Arg-238.Tryp-Lys-C81240.5fmasses given in descending order of mass spectral signal intensity.Ac-Ala-2 –Arg-171240.6bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Fragment contains one unmodified arginine residue.4325.0Ala-79 –Lys-1234325.5caverage mass [M+H]+.Fragment does not contain arginine.5487.3His-26 –Arg-785488.8caverage mass [M+H]+.Fragment contains two unmodified arginine residues.1765.7Ac-Ala-2 –Arg-231751.9bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Fragment + one methyl group1751.6Ac-Ala-2 –Arg-231751.9bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Unmodified fragment, missed cleavage after Arg-171779.7Ac-Ala-2 –Arg-231751.9bmonoisotopic mass [M+H]+.Fragment + two methyl groupsSamples containing modified arginine residues are in bold.

Mass spectra were recorded on a REFLEX MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with SCOUT ion source and pulsed ion extraction (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany). Data were analyzed with the XMASS software supplied with the spectrometer. For analysis of peptides, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and nitrocellulose were dissolved in acetone to a concentration of 20 and 5 g/liter, respectively. 1 μl of this solution was deposited on a stainless steel sample stage. 1 μl of peptide solution was spotted onto this matrix surface. Protein analysis was carried out using sinapinic acid as matrix. A layer of a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (39:60:1 acetone, methanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v/v)) was applied to the sample stage. A mixture of 1 μl of the protein and 1 μl of a second saturated sinapinic acid solution (30:20:50 acetonitrile:methanol:water (v/v/v)) was then applied on the matrix layer. All spectra were calibrated using external standards. Amino acid sequencing was carried out with an Applied Biosystems 476A sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions. MMA,N G-N G'-DMA (symmetric) and N G-N G-DMA (asymmetric) (Sigma) were directly applied to the sequencer filter, and after one cycle the phenylthiohydantoin amino acid retention times were obtained. These were used for comparison with retention times of peptide-derived phenylthiohydantoin amino acids. We set out to identify the nature of arginine modifications and to map their locations in the entire PABP2 sequence by proteolytic digestion of the protein and subsequent analysis of the derived fragments by sequencing and MALDI-TOF-MS. Lys-C fragments that could be assigned to the PABP2 sequence were labeled Lys-C1–8 in the order of elution from the HPLC column (TableI). The fragments designated Lys-C5b and Lys-C5c were shoulders eluting after the main peak Lys-C5a. The entire PABP2 sequence could be accounted for except for three small peptides (Leu-136—Lys-137, Phe-208—Lys-213 and Val-244—Lys-247), none of which contained arginine. The cDNA-derived PABP2 amino acid sequence with the sites of modification is shown in Fig. 1. All residue numbering is according to this sequence. For an overview of the fragments, their masses, and assignments, see Table I. Sequences obtained from individual fragments are listed in Table II.Table IIObtained sequences of PABP2 proteolytic digestion fragmentsPeptideObtained sequenceLys-C5aESVRTLys-C6RTNRPGISTTD(DMA)GFP(DMA)A(DMA)Y(DMA)A(DMA)TTNYNSS(DMA)S(DMA)FYSGFNChym-Lys-C6 (a)(DMA)G(DMA)A(DMA)ATSChym-Lys-C6 (b)SGFNS(DMA)P(DMA)G(DMA)VY(DMA) Open table in a new tab Fragments Lys-C1, Lys-C3, and Lys-C4 did not contain arginine in their sequences. The fragment Lys-C2 assigned to Ala-124—Lys-135 contained two arginine residues, Arg-125 and Arg-127. Lys-C5a was assigned to Glu-224—Lys-243. This assignment was confirmed by sequencing. The fragment contained three arginine residues, Arg-227, Arg-238, and Arg-240. The observed masses of all the above-mentioned fragments were in very close agreement with the masses predicted from the cDNA sequence, indicating no modification of amino acid residues. Lys-C5b and Lys-C5c are discussed below. Fragment Lys-C7, corresponding to Met-167–Lys-207, contained two arginine residues, Arg-172 and Arg-200. This fragment also contained two cysteine residues, Cys-195 and Cys-205. The observed mass of this fragment corresponded to the predicted mass plus two pyridylethyl cysteine modifications, indicating that the two arginine residues present are unmodified. Fifteen sites of arginine modification were found in the remaining PABP2 fragments by mass spectral analysis and sequencing. The largest discrepancy between observed and predicted mass was seen in the C-terminal fragment Lys-C6, corresponding to Arg-248—Tyr-306. The difference, 364.8 mass units, corresponds to the addition of 26 methyl groups, assuming the only modification present is methylation. The predicted sequence of the fragment contains 15 arginine residues. Upon sequencing of the first 35 amino acids in Lys-C6, the initial two arginine residues, Arg-248 and Arg-251, were found to be unmodified, whereas arginines 259, 263, 265, 267, 269, 277, and 279 were found to be dimethylated. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of the modified arginines had the same retention time in the sequencer as anN G-N G-DMA standard. Sequences obtained from two secondary chymotryptic fragments, one generated by incomplete digestion, confirmed the dimethylation of arginines 287, 289, 291, 294, 296, and 298 (Table II). Some heterogeneity in the extent and nature of arginine modification was observed at two locations. The two peptides Lys-C5b and Lys-C5c, eluted from the HPLC column as shoulders of Lys-C5a, were, based on their masses, assigned to Glu-224—Lys-243 with the addition of 1 and 2 methyl groups, respectively. The predicted sequence of the peptides (ESVRTSLALDESLFRGRQIK) contained three arginine residues, any one of which could be a site of modification. Sequencing confirmed the identity of the peptides and identified their fourth amino acid as unmodified arginine. Data quality was not sufficient for unequivocal identification of the remaining arginines. To localize the site of modification, a secondary tryptic digest was carried out on peptides Lys-C5b and Lys-C5c. Mass spectral analysis of the entire digest gave fragments with masses corresponding to the predicted sequence TSLALDESLFRGR with the addition of one and two methyl groups for Tryp-Lys-C5b and Tryp-Lys-C5c, respectively. Trypsin will not cleave after a methylated arginine residue (22Kim S. Merrill B. Rajpurohit R. Kumar A. Stone K. Papov V. Schneiders J. Szer W. Wilson S. Paik W. Williams K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5185-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and therefore it is assumed that the site of modification in both Lys-C5b and Lys-C5c is Arg-238. In the Lys-C5b tryptic digest, a significant peak with a mass of 1251 Da, corresponding to Thr-228—Arg-238 without modification, was also observed, indicating that the separation of the two peptides Lys-C5a and Lys-C5b was not complete. The relative amounts of the unmodified, monomethylated, and dimethylated peptides, i.e. Lys-C5a, Lys-C5b, and Lys-C5c, were approximately 2:1:1 based on HPLC peak heights. Fragment Lys-C8, corresponding to the N terminus of the protein, had an observed mass of 11,836.7 Da. The predicted mass was 11930.7 Da. The N terminus of the protein was blocked, and the mass discrepancy infers removal of the initial methionine residue and N terminus acetylation. However, the high mass of this peak made discernment of partial modification with a single methyl residue unlikely, so a secondary tryptic digest was carried out. Fragments obtained from this digest (Tryp-Lys-C8) included minute amounts of two peptides corresponding to the sequence acetyl—Ala-2—Arg-23 with the addition of 1 or 2 methyl groups. The full predicted sequence of these fragments was acetyl-AAAAAAAAAAGAAGGRGSGPGR. As in the case of Lys-C5b and Lys-C5c, the presence of methylated arginine groups in a tryptic peptide ending with arginine infers that the modification occurs on the interior arginine, in this case Arg-17. Further evidence was obtained by treatment of the entire tryptic digest with carboxypeptidase B. Mass spectral analysis after this treatment gave fragments with masses of the original fragments less the mass of one unmodified arginine residue. In contrast to Arg-238, which was modified to about 50%, a very small proportion (<5%) of Arg-17 was found to be methylated. We cannot be certain as to the exact identity of the modified residues at Arg-17 and Arg-238, as these fragments could not be sequenced. However, as N G-N G'-DMA (symmetric) has thus far only been found in myelin basic protein (23Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,38Rawal N. Rajpurohit R. Lischwe M.A. Williams K.R. Paik W.K. Kim S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), it is highly unlikely that the modified arginine residues at Arg-17 and Arg-238 are the symmetric form of DMA. Arg-24 and Arg-25 could not be assigned to any tryptic fragment from the Tryp-Lys-C8 digest. This suggests that they are unmodified arginine residues that served as tryptic cleavage sites. It is also possible that Arg-24 is modified to a very small extent, and Arg-23 and Arg-25 serve as tryptic cleavage sites. The resulting dipeptide Arg-24—Arg-25 would not be detected by MALDI-TOF-MS. The measured mass of the entire HPLC-purified protein was 33,253 Da. This is in excellent agreement with the predicted mass of 33,252.5 Da, assuming removal of the initial methionine, acetylation, alkylation of two cysteine residues, and the addition of 26 methyl groups. The two mammalian methyltransferases PRMT1 and PRMT3, expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins (24Lin W.-J. Gary J. Yang M. Clarke S. Herschman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 26Tang J. Gary J. Clarke S. Herschman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), were able to methylate E. coli-expressed PABP2 and various deletion mutants withS-adenosyl-l-methionine as the methyl group donor (Fig. 2). As expected, the best substrates were those that contained the C terminus of the protein. Both the N-terminal deletion mutant (PABP2 ΔN) and the isolated C-terminal domain (Fig. 2, b and c, lanes 4 and 5) appeared to be better substrates for both PRMT1 and PRMT3 than the complete protein (lane 1). In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, use of PRMT3 at an approximately 2.5-fold higher molar concentration than PRMT1 led to a similar extent of methylation. In previous experiments (26Tang J. Gary J. Clarke S. Herschman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), PRMT3 had approximately 1% of the activity of PRMT1 when GST-GAR was used as a methyl-accepting substrate. Thus, the activity of the GST-PRMT3 protein toward PABP2 was higher than expected. Extra methylated bands in Fig. 2, band c, are presumably contaminants from the substrate or PRMT fusion protein purification. Their identities are unknown. Lys-C digestion of full-length recombinant PABP2 methylated in vitro by GST-PRMT1 followed by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis indicated a shift of the C-terminal fragment to a higher mass (Fig. 3, b and d). No additional peaks corresponding to methylated species were found in any other peptide (compare with Fig. 3, a and c); all observed masses were in close agreement with predicted values (data not shown). The C-terminal peak was centered at around 7069 mass units, corresponding to the addition of four methyl groups per fragment. The mass distribution of the C-terminal fragment could be modeled with an average of 0.22 methyl groups/arginine residue (data not shown). Taking into account this level of methylation, the resolution of MALDI-TOF MS and the number of arginines in the different peptides, and assuming random methylation, methylated species of the peptides corresponding to Lys-C2, Lys-C7, and Lys-C5 should have been detectable. These species were not observed, indicating that methylation in vitro was preferentially directed to the C terminus. Preferential methylation of the C terminus upon in vitro methylation of PABP2 by GST-PRMT3 was also observed (data not shown). Previous studies on the substrate specificity of arginine methylation, based on sequence comparison of the 20 thus far mapped sites of arginine dimethylation, described a preferred recognition motif of Phe/Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Gly/Phe with the C-terminal-flanking glycine considered obligatory (22Kim S. Merrill B. Rajpurohit R. Kumar A. Stone K. Papov V. Schneiders J. Szer W. Wilson S. Paik W. Williams K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5185-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Najbauer J. Johnson B.A. Young A.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10501-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In PABP2, only 3 of the 13 identified sites of complete arginine dimethylation have a C-terminal-flanking glycine, and of these three, none have an N-terminal-flanking glycine. Arg-17 has N- and C-terminal-flanking glycine residues, but only a small subpopulation of Arg-17 is mono- or dimethylated. Twelve of the modified residues occur within a distinct RXR motif, where both arginines in the motif are completely asymmetrically dimethylated, and X is, in most cases, a small amino acid (Gly, Ala, Ser, or Pro) or, in one case, tyrosine. PABP2 contains three RXR motifs (Arg-23—Arg-25, Arg-76—Arg-78, and Arg-125—Arg-127) with unmethylated arginines. The sequence RXR is thus not a sufficient determinant of arginine dimethylation. As amino acids 76–78 are RPR, the identity ofX cannot be a sufficient determinant either. It remains to be determined whether the additional criteria are the sequence context, the accessibility of the arginines for the methyltransferase, or the clustering of RXR motifs. The N-terminal deletion mutant was a better substrate for both PRMT1 and PRMT3 than the entire protein. It is possible that the acidic N terminus makes intra- or intermolecular contacts with the basic C terminus, the disruption of which improves accessibility for the methyltransferase. Note, however, that the increased molar concentration of the smaller substrates may also have promoted increased levels of methylation. A data base search for other proteins containing an RXRXRXR sequence with Pro, Tyr, Ala, or Gly in the X position identified a number of nuclear proteins including high molecular weight basic fibroblast growth factor and ribosomal protein S2. High molecular weight basic fibroblast growth factor has been shown to contain DMA within its RG motifs (32Pintucci G. Quarto N. Rifkin D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Burgess W.H. Bizik J. Mehlman T. Quarto N. Rifkin D.B. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 41Sommer A. Moscatelli D. Rifkin D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although the exact nature of the arginine modification has yet to be established. Ribosomal protein S2 has RGGF and RGR motifs and is likely to contain DMA (42Suzuki K. Olvera J. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20007-20010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ICP27, an RNA-binding protein from herpesvirus, has RGR repeats in its sequence and is methylated in vivo,although the sites of methylation have not been identified (17Mears W. Rice S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If one includes serine in the X position in the data base search, a great many splicing factors with their characteristic SR repeats are found. In the case of PABP2 amino acids, Ser-276—Arg-279 form an SRSR motif in which both arginines are dimethylated. This raises the possibility that splicing factors could serve as methyl-accepting substrates in vivo. In fact, the yeast protein Npl3p has been shown to be subject to both arginine methylation and serine phosphorylation (29Siebel C. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13641-13646Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although these modifications have not yet been mapped, the protein contains a number of SRGG motifs, which might serve as targets for both. As yet, arginine dimethylation has not been detected in the well studied mammalian SR proteins. The RGG domain of nucleolin, which is built up of RGGF repeats and contains N G,N G-DMA, has been suggested to form repeated type I β-turns (9Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Gly-239 of PABP2 corresponds to a conserved glycine residue that is found in most RNP domains (6Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) and forms part of a type I β turn (6Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 43Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.H. Nagai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 44Nagai K. Oubridge C. Ito N. Avis J. Evans P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 235-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 45Xu R.M. Jokhan L. Cheng X. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 559-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This amino acid lies in the center of an RXR motif. Although Arg-238 is only partially methylated, and Arg-240 is unmethylated, this observation suggests that RXR motifs in the C terminus of PABP2 might also form type I β-turns. The finding that two different sequences, RXR clusters and (F/G)GGRGG(G/F) (see above), are subject to asymmetric arginine dimethylation might suggest that each of the two identified mammalian arginine methyltransferases serves one of these two substrates. However, the situation is far from clear. Most studies of arginine methylation in vitro have been carried out with enzyme preparations from mammalian tissue (23Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Najbauer J. Johnson B.A. Young A.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10501-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Ghosh S. Syed S. Jung S. Paik W. Kim S. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1075-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their molecular compositions were ill-defined, and their relationship to PRMT1 and -3 is unknown. The two cloned methyltransferases, PRMT1 and PRMT3, may be just the catalytic subunits of larger complexes (23Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover,in vitro arginine methylation reactions are generally plagued by poor efficiency. Thus, conclusions concerning substrate specificity may be premature. The activity of both PRMT1 and PRMT3in vitro was directed toward the C terminus of PABP2, with PRMT3 apparently being more efficient than expected from previous experiments with a standard RGG substrate. This suggests that both enzymes may have specificity for RXR clusters. There is a possibility that this apparent specificity is directed by the structure of the substrate protein rather than a preference of the enzymes for particular amino acid sequences. However, in a comparison of several synthetic peptides, a peptide with clustered RGR sequences was by far the best in vitro substrate for arginine methyltransferase preparations from three different tissues (38Rawal N. Rajpurohit R. Lischwe M.A. Williams K.R. Paik W.K. Kim S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Biochemical assays of PABP2 have so far not revealed any function for arginine methylation. Recombinant and authentic proteins are indistinguishable with respect to the stimulation of polyadenylation and length control (4Nemeth A. Krause S. Blank D. Jenny A. Jenö P. Lustig A. Wahle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Under standard reaction conditions, we have also not detected any difference in the RNA binding properties of the two proteins.3 In addition to some similarity in the general amino acid composition, the C-terminal RXR domain of PABP2 shares two further features with the RGG domain in that it contains the characteristic modified amino acid asymmetric dimethylarginine, and it binds RNA in a nonsequence specific manner.3 Structural studies are needed to decide whether RXR and RGG sequences are merely two variations on the same theme or two different motifs fulfilling similar roles. We are grateful to Peter Bayer, Uwe Kühn, and Sylke Meyer for advice, discussions, and reading the manuscript. We thank Thomas Pfeifer, who carried out the carboxypeptidase B digest."
https://openalex.org/W2037751628,"KIT receptor kinase activity is repressed, prior to stem cell factor binding, by unknown structural constraints. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we examined the role of KIT intracellular juxtamembrane residues Met-552 through Ile-563 in controlling receptor autophosphorylation. Alanine substitution for Tyr-553, Trp-557, Val-559, or Val-560, all sitting along the hydrophobic side of an amphipathic α-helix (Tyr-553–Ile-563) predicted by the Chou-Fasman algorithm, resulted in substantially increased spontaneous receptor phosphorylation, revealing inhibitory roles for these residues. Alanine substitution for other residues, most of which are on the hydrophilic side of the helix, caused no or slightly increased basal receptor phosphorylation. Converting Tyr-553 or Trp-557 to phenylalanine generated slight or no elevation, respectively, in basal KIT phosphorylation, indicating that the phenyl ring of Tyr-553 and the hydrophobicity of Trp-557 are critical for the inhibition. Although alanine substitution for Lys-558 had no effect on receptor phosphorylation, its substitution with proline produced high spontaneous receptor phosphorylation, suggesting that the predicted α-helical conformation is involved in the inhibition. A synthetic peptide comprising Tyr-553 through Ile-563 showed circular dichroism spectra characteristic of α-helix, supporting the structural prediction. Thus, the KIT intracellular juxtamembrane region contains important residues which, in a putative α-helical conformation, exert inhibitory control on the kinase activity of ligand-unoccupied receptor. KIT receptor kinase activity is repressed, prior to stem cell factor binding, by unknown structural constraints. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we examined the role of KIT intracellular juxtamembrane residues Met-552 through Ile-563 in controlling receptor autophosphorylation. Alanine substitution for Tyr-553, Trp-557, Val-559, or Val-560, all sitting along the hydrophobic side of an amphipathic α-helix (Tyr-553–Ile-563) predicted by the Chou-Fasman algorithm, resulted in substantially increased spontaneous receptor phosphorylation, revealing inhibitory roles for these residues. Alanine substitution for other residues, most of which are on the hydrophilic side of the helix, caused no or slightly increased basal receptor phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2112752761,"The relationship between focal adhesion protein (FAK) activity and loss of cell-matrix contact during apoptosis is not entirely clear nor has the role of FAK in chemically induced apoptosis been studied. We investigated the status of FAK phosphorylation and cleavage in renal epithelial cells during apoptosis caused by the nephrotoxicant dichlorovinylcysteine (DCVC). DCVC treatment caused a loss of cell-matrix contact which was preceded by a dissociation of FAK from the focal adhesions and tyrosine dephosphorylation of FAK. Paxillin was also dephosphorylated at tyrosine. DCVC treatment activated caspase-3 which was associated with cleavage of FAK. However, FAK cleavage occurred after cells had already lost focal adhesions indicating that cleavage of FAK by caspases is not responsible for loss of FAK from focal adhesions. Accordingly, although inhibition of caspase activity with zVAD-fmk blocked activation of caspase-3, FAK cleavage, and apoptosis, it neither affected dephosphorylation nor translocation of FAK or paxillin. However, zVAD-fmk completely blocked the cell detachment caused by DCVC treatment. Orthovanadate prevented DCVC-induced tyrosine dephosphorylation of both FAK and paxillin; however, it did not inhibit DCVC-induced apoptosis and actually potentiated focal adhesion disorganization and cell detachment. Thus, FAK dephosphorylation and loss of focal adhesions are not due to caspase activation; however, caspases are required for FAK proteolysis and cell detachment.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is critical for normal development and tissue homeostasis (1Sanders E.J. Wride M.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 163: 105-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, uncontrolled apoptosis, as may occur after treatment with cytostatic chemicals, is a pathophysiological process and is associated with the occurrence of various human diseases (2Reed J.C.

Presumably, the change of function (gain or loss) caused by proteolysis of multiple target proteins contributes to apoptosis. Thus, the proteolysis of cytoskeleton-associated proteins is most likely involved in the morphological alterations observed during apoptosis in vitroand in vivo, i.e. membrane blebbing and “rounding up” of cells. Maintenance of cell-matrix contact is an important cell survival factor (16Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 17Schwartz M.A. J.

Enforced loss of cell-matrix interactions of endothelial and epithelial cells, is sufficient to initiate a form of apoptosis that has been termed “anoikis” (18Meredith Jr., J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 19Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar). The fact that apoptotic cells detach from their substratum raises the possibility that the signaling events leading to anoikis are either the same as, or may overlap with signals that lead to other forms of apoptosis, for example, induced by chemicals or FasL/tumor necrosis factor. Cell-matrix interactions occur at the closest contact between the cell and the substratum: the focal adhesions. This is a complex network of (cytoskeletal) proteins that links the filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeletal network through cell adhesion molecules, so called integrins, to the extracellular matrix (16Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 17Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 22Ilic D.

Integrin engagement by the extracellular matrix results in activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). FAK is a 125-kDa protein tyrosine kinase that is critical in transmission of signals from the focal adhesion to the cytoplasm after cell attachment (24Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M.

After activation, FAK interacts with a variety of focal adhesion (signaling) macromolecules, including the adaptor proteins paxillin and Grb-2, the cytoskeletal proteins tensin and talin, and signal transduction molecules such as Src, Fyn, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (22Ilic D.

For example, the SH2 domain of phosphoinositide 3-kinase binds FAK at the tyrosine autophosphorylation site (Tyr397) (34Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol.

Although FAK is one of the few proteins that is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon cell adhesion, its role in the activation of all of the above signaling pathways is still under investigation. Nonetheless, it seems clear that FAK is important for focal adhesion signaling and cell attachment and migration. Although the downstream effector molecules responsible for FAK signaling are not completely known, there is increasing evidence that FAK is involved in anoikis and, perhaps, other forms of apoptosis (12Crouch D.H.

For example, microinjection of peptides that compete for FAK-integrin association, and also antibodies directed against FAK itself can induce apoptosis in fibroblasts (48Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Treatment of tumor cells with FAK antisense oligonucleotides also leads to apoptosis (47Xu L.H. Owens L.V. Sturge G.C. Yang X. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of constitutively active FAK prevents anoikis (46Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J.

Recombinant FAK is also cleaved by recombinant caspase-3 and -6 into fragments of approximately 44, 77, and 85 kDa corresponding to the fragments seen during FAK cleavage in apoptotic cells (13Wen L.P.

Despite the fact that FAK cleavage and/or inactivation provides an attractive explanation for the loss of cell-matrix interactions that occur during apoptosis, there is little or no evidence supporting this assumption, nor has the role of FAK signaling been addressed in chemically induced models of apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, the majority of studies have been performed in immortalized or transformed cells; little is known about the involvement of FAK signaling and cell detachment in vivo or in primary cultures of normal epithelial cells. Therefore, we have investigated the role of FAK in chemically induced apoptosis in primary cultures of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. The renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTE) are an important target for a variety of nephrotoxic chemicals as well as ischemia/reperfusion injury (52Brady H.R. Brenner B.M. Lieberthal W.M. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1996: 1200-1252Google Scholar, 53Goldstein R.S. Schnellmann R. Klaassen C. Amdur M.O. Doull J. Toxicology. McGraw Hill, New York1996: 417-442Google Scholar). Death of renal epithelial cells is associated with detachment of viable RPTE from the extracellular matrix, both in vitro and in vivo, an effect that is related to redistribution of integrins and loss of focal adhesion organization (54Racusen L.C.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 601-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Conditions that prevent attachment of the renal epithelial cell line Madin-Darby canine kidney also cause apoptosis, suggesting that there is a relationship between cell detachment and cell death (19Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar, 46Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J.

Therefore, we investigated the role of FAK phosphorylation and its cleavage during loss of focal adhesion integrity and apoptosis of primary cultures of rat RPTE using the well characterized nephrotoxicantS-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC) (57Van de Water B.

DCVC is metabolized by a β-lyase to a reactive acylating metabolite that covalently modifies cellular macromolecules (60Stevens J.L. Robbins J.D. Byrd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15529-15537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Hayden P.J. Stevens J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 468-476PubMed Google Scholar, 62Chen Q. Jones T.W. Brown P.C.

Cell death of primary cultured RPTE caused by DCVC treatment is preceded by disorganization of the F-actin cytoskeletal network and dissolution of focal adhesions (57Van de Water B. Jaspers J.J. Maasdam D.H. Mulder G.J. Nagelkerke J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 267: F888-F899Google Scholar, 58Van de Water B. Kruidering M. Nagelkerke J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F593-F603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this compound is a useful agent to study the role of focal adhesion disturbance and cell detachment in apoptosis of primary cultures of kidney epithelial cells. To study the relationship between focal adhesion assembly, FAK phosphorylation, and apoptosis and to investigate whether disturbances in FAK signaling may contribute to chemically induced apoptosis in RPTE, we determined FAK localization and phosphorylation. These effects were correlated with activation of caspases and the occurrence of apoptosis after DCVC treatment. Apoptosis of RPTE was preceded by anearly tyrosine dephosphorylation of both FAK and the FAK-associated protein paxillin. Dephosphorylation was also associated with an early redistribution of FAK and paxillin from the focal adhesion. The cleavage of FAK was a late event and followed the activation of caspases. The general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk blocked the DCVC-induced increase in caspase activity, FAK cleavage, and apoptosis; however, FAK dephosphorylation and translocation still occurred. The data suggest that FAK dephosphorylation and dissolution of the focal adhesions precede cleavage of FAK by caspases during chemically induced apoptosis of renal epithelial cells. Fetal bovine serum was from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, bovine serum albumin fraction V, cholera toxin, insulin, antibiotic were from Sigma. Epidermal growth factor was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (UBI, Lake Placid, NY).N,N′-Diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPPD) was from Kodak (Rochester, NY). Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Rhodamine-phalloidin was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, CA). DCVC was synthesized as described (61Hayden P.J. Stevens J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 468-476PubMed Google Scholar). RPTE were isolated by collagenase perfusion and separated by density centrifugation using Nycodenz as described (63Van de Water B. Zoeteweij J.P. de Bont H.J. Mulder G.J. Nagelkerke J.F. J. Biol.

Cells were cultured on rat tail collagen (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) coated dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10 ng/ml cholera toxin, and antibiotics as described (57Van de Water B.

Biol. 1989; 25: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide and fed every other day. Cells were used after they had reached confluency 6 to 9 days after plating. Confluent monolayers of RPTE in 24-well dishes containing coated glass coverslips, 6-well or 10-cm dishes, were washed with Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) twice. Thereafter cells were treated with DCVC in EBSS in a final volume of 1, 2, or 10 ml, respectively, for 4 h. To study events that are related to apoptosis, cells were treated with DCVC in the presence of DPPD (20 μm; 10 mmstock in dimethyl sulfoxide) which blocks necrotic cell death but allows the onset of apoptosis (58Van de Water B. Kruidering M. Nagelkerke J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F593-F603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 65Zhan Y. Cleveland J.L. Stevens J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6755-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The inhibitors zVAD-fmk (100 μm; 100 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide) or Na3VO4 (5, 10, 25, or 50 μm; 100 mm stock in water) were added simultaneously with DCVC. Following treatment with DCVC for 4 h, cells were allowed to recover in complete medium containing DPPD (20 μm) with or without the above inhibitors. Cell death was measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture medium as described (62Chen Q. Jones T.W. Brown P.C. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21603-21611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Percentage of cell death was calculated from the amount of LDH release caused by treatment with toxicants relative to the amount released by 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, i.e.100% release. To determine the percentage of cell detachment, floating cells (supernatant) and adherent cells (obtained after trypsinization; see below) were collected separately. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer and the percentage of cell detachment was calculated as floating cells/total cells times 100%. DNA laddering was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cells were harvested by scraping the adherent cells which were then combined with floating cells present in the culture medium. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was washed once with ice-cold PBS by centrifugation, lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.4), and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation; the supernatant was treated with RNase (60 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and then with proteinase K (120 μg/ml) for 1 h at 50 °C. The DNA was precipitated with 0.5m NaCl and an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol and separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. Nuclear fragmentation was determined in cells cultured on collagen-coated glass coverslips. After fixation with 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde, cells were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in PBS. After washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted and viewed using a Nikon epifluorescence microscope. In some experiments nuclear staining was combined with immunofluorescence staining (see below). Apoptosis was also determined by cell cycle analysis. Both floating and adherent cells that were trypsinized were pooled and fixed in 90% ethanol (−20 °C). After washing cells twice with PBS/EDTA (1 mm), cells were resuspended in PBS-EDTA containing 10 μg/ml RNase A and 7.5 μm propidium iodide. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson) and the percentage of cells present in sub-G0/G1 was calculated using the LYSIS software (Becton Dickinson). Caspase activity was assayed as follows. Briefly, attached and detached cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation as above. The cell pellet was taken up in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm EGTA) and subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing. Equal amounts of cell proteins were used in a caspase assay using acetyl-DEVD-AMC (25 μm; Research Biochemicals Int., Natick, MA) as a substrate. Fluorescence derived from release of the AMC moiety was followed using a fluorescence plate reader (HTS 7000 Bioassay reader; Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Caspase activity was calculated as picomole/min/mg cell protein using AMC as a standard. For immunoprecipitation studies cells were plated in 10-cm Petri dishes coated with collagen. After treatment with toxicant cells were harvested in a Tris-sucrose-EGTA (TSE) buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm sodium fluoride. After sonication, 500 μg of cell protein was incubated overnight with 1 volume of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate), with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described for TSE buffer making a total volume of 1 ml.

This observation suggests that inhibition of L1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we examine the effects of ethanol on L1 homophilic binding and on L1-mediated neurite outgrowth. Ethanol had no effect on cell adhesion or aggregation in a myeloma cell line expressing full-length human L1. In contrast, the rate of L1-mediated neurite outgrowth of rat postnatal day 6 cerebellar granule cells grown on a substratum of NgCAM, the chick homologue of L1, was inhibited by 48.6% in the presence of ethanol with a half-maximal concentration of 4.7 mm. The same effect was found with soluble L1-Fc, thus showing that the inhibitory effect is not dependent on cell adhesion. In contrast, neither laminin nor N-cadherin-mediated neurite outgrowth was inhibited by physiologic concentrations of ethanol. We conclude that one mechanism of ethanol's toxicity to the developing central nervous system may be the inhibition of L1-mediated neurite outgrowth.

Harousseau H. Borteryu J. Menuet J. Quest Medicale. 1968; 21: 476-482Google Scholar). The criteria for diagnosis, established by the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Study Group, are as follows: 1) pre- or postnatal growth retardation, 2) craniofacial dysmorphology including microphthalmia, and 3) neurologic abnormalities including mental retardation (2Clarren S. Smith D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1978; 298: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Conservative estimates place the overall rate of FAS at 0.33/1000, with 1200 children/year born with FAS (3Abel E. Sokol R. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1991; 15: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Alcohol-related birth and neurodevelopmental defects are thought to be anywhere from 3–4 times as common as FAS (4Abel E. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Medical Economics Company Inc., Oradell, NJ1990Google Scholar). The Institute of Medicine has recently divided FAS and other effects into five separate categories, including a category for patients with only neurodevelopmental pathology, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (5Institute of Medicine Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Diagnosis, Epidemiology, Prevention, and Treatment. National Academy Press, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar). Although multiple organ systems are affected in FAS, the central nervous system appears to be particularly sensitive. The list of neuropathological anomalies found in FAS infants and children include neuronal-glial heterotopias, cerebellar dysplasia, agenesis of the corpus callosum, hydrocephalus, enlarged lateral ventricles, and microcephaly (2Clarren S.

Magnetic resonance imaging in 10 patients with FAS revealed central nervous system anomalies in all 10 (7Swayze V. Johnson V. Hanson J. Piven J. Sato Y. Giedd J. Mosnik D. Andreason N. Pediatrics. 1997; 99: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Six of these patients had midline defects including partial to complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, hypoplastic corpus callosum, cavum septum pellucidi, and cavum vergae. The other four had microcephaly. Overlap of the neuropathological abnormalities observed in FAS with those of patients with L1 mutations has led to the hypothesis that ethanol acts via disruption of L1-mediated events (8Charness M.E. Safran R.M. Perides G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9304-9309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L1 is a member of the Ig superfamily of cell adhesion molecules (9Lindner J. Rathjen F. Schachner M. Nature. 1983; 305: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). L1 was initially identified when antibodies to L1 disrupted migration of granule cellsin vitro (9Lindner J. Rathjen F. Schachner M. Nature. 1983; 305: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Cell lines that express L1 support migration of cerebellar neurons (10Miura M. Asou H. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10752-10758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L1 binds to another molecule of L1 on an opposed surface in homophilic binding (11Lemmon V. Farr K. Lagenaur C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1597-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and enables growth cones to extend rapidly along a bundle of pre-existing axons. Several second messenger systems appear to be involved in L1-mediated neurite outgrowth including the following: 1) serine phosphorylation (12Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Rat postnatal day 6 cerebellar neurons have been shown to extend neurites when cultured on either rat L1 or the chick homologue of L1, NgCAM. Initial studies using a cell line that expresses L1 following incubation with human osteogenic protein-1 revealed a significant reduction of aggregation in the presence of ethanol. Half-maximal inhibition occurred at 7 mm ethanol with a maximum of 55% inhibition of aggregation (8Charness M.E. Safran R.M. Perides G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9304-9309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments utilizing a human fibroblast line transfected with full-length human L1 confirmed these findings (24Ramanathan R. Wilkemeyer M. Mittal B. Perides G. Charness M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In contrast, ethanol does not inhibit aggregation either inDrosophila S2 cells that express neuroglian, theDrosophila homologue of L1, or are transfected to express human L1 (25Vallejo Y. Hortsch M. Dubreuil R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12244-12247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have further investigated the effect of ethanol on L1-mediated binding and neurite outgrowth. J558L immunoglobulin-deficient mouse myeloma cells transfected with full-length human L1 were prepared as described previously (26Wong E. Cheng G. Payne H. Lemmon V. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the full-length L1 amino acid sequence including the alternatively spliced RSLE motif in the cytoplasmic domain and a 3′ splicing donor site was constructed from clones C2, 3.1, and 17 of a human fetal brain library (27Hlavin M.L. Lemmon V. Genomics. 1991; 11: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in pBluescript vector (Stratagene). The coding region was then sequenced. The expression vector used for this study has been described previously (28Traunecker A. Lanzavecchia A. Karjalainen K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3655-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the L1 was excised from the pBluescript vector with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into pJanusin, replacing the Janusin cDNA, 5′ to an Ig poly(A) tract. This placed the cDNA under transcriptional control of an Ig Vk promoter and an Igk enhancer. The plasmid contained a minigene conferring resistance to histidinol. J558L immunoglobulin-deficient myeloma cells were transfected with 10–40 μg of DNA/107 cells by electroporation. The cells were grown in 96-well dishes for 48 h in medium (RPMI, 10% fetal bovine serum) to allow for expression of the histidinol resistance gene before the addition of selective medium (containing 2.5 mm histidinol). L1-expressing cells were identified by immunofluorescence. Live cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human L1 at 1:250 for 30 min on ice. The cells were then washed three times in Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF) and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies at 1:500 for 30 min on ice. The cells were again washed three times in buffer and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Cells from positive wells were cloned using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Coulter Elite ESP). One clone (phL1A/pJ, 2a10–2C8) was used for all experiments. Rat cerebellar granule cells were obtained from postnatal day 6 Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Zivic-Miller). Cerebellums were dissected and incubated in 1% trypsin-EDTA for 15 min on ice and then triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes in the presence of 0.05% DNase. The cells were allowed to settle for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in tissue culture medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified essential medium with 10% fetal horse serum and 2.5 mg/100 ml gentamicin (DMEM complete) and counted. Viability was assessed with trypan blue. Cells were seeded onto tissue culture plates at either 1.5 × 105 cells/dish for NgCAM and L1 or 105 for laminin. These cells have been extensively characterized as >90% cerebellar granule cells (29Beattie C. Siegel R. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Messer A. Brain Res. 1977; 130: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 31Messer A. Smith D.M. Brain Res. 1977; 130: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Hockberger P.E. Tseng H.-T. Connor J.A. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1370-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose was obtained from Schleicher and Schuell. Laminin was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., Collaborative Research. Rat L1 and chick NgCAM were purified using an affinity column conjugated to 74–5H7 (11Lemmon V. Farr K. Lagenaur C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1597-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) or 8D9 (33Lemmon V. McLoon S. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2987-2994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies, respectively. N-cadherin was purified using an affinity column with antibody NCD-2 (34Burden-Gulley S. Payne H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L1-Fc was prepared as follows. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a fragment of clone 17 that contains the extracellular domain of L1 with primers from 2901 to 2918 and 3336 to 3319 to create a whole extracellular domain of human L1 cDNA. The latter primer also had a 3′ splice donor site and EcoRI restriction site. The amplified fragment was digested with BsiWI and EcoRI and ligated into aBsiWI/EcoRI-digested pBluescript vector containing the full-length L1 cDNA. The vector was sequenced across the entire amplified region and insertion sites. The truncated L1 cDNA containing the whole extracellular domain of L1 was excised from the vector with HindIII and EcoRI and ligated into the pIG vector (Ingenius), which contains the Fc region of human immunoglobin isotype 1. The completed vector was electroporated into Escherichia coli MC1061 cells. Plasmid DNA was purified by alkaline lysis and checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid was transiently expressed in COS7 cells. L1-Fc was purified from the tissue culture media by affinity chromatography using protein A-Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad). Tissue culture plates were prepared as described previously (23Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A 5-cm2 strip of nitrocellulose was dissolved in 12 ml of methanol. Aliquots of this solution were spread over the surface of Corning 35-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to dry under a laminar flow hood. Substrates were then applied to the dishes by spreading 4 μl of substrate solution across a 0.7-cm diameter spot on the nitrocellulose-coated dish. Rat L1, chick NgCAM, N-cadherin, and laminin were used with protein concentrations of 0.8, 0.3, 0.014, and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. After 10 min, the droplets were removed by aspiration, and the area was washed twice with CMF. The substrates were then blocked with 1 ml of DMEM complete for 30 min in a 37 °C 10% CO2 incubator. The substrate plates were washed twice with DMEM complete and were incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2 while cerebellar cells were being prepared. For plates with bound L1-Fc, protein A was used as a 1 mg/ml solution and applied to 35-mm tissue culture dishes (35Stanescu G.L. Swick A.R. Tuohy V.K. Rudick R.A. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1991; 5: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 34Burden-Gulley S. Payne H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 10 min, the solution was aspirated, and the dish was washed twice with CMF. 8.5 μg of L1-Fc was spread across a 0.7-cm diameter spot on the dish. After 10 min, the droplets were removed by aspiration, and the area was washed twice with CMF. The plates were then blocked as described for laminin and NgCAM. For experiments with soluble L1-Fc, nitrocellulose-coated tissue culture dishes were covered with 250 μl of 0.01% poly l-lysine. After 10 min, dishes were washed twice and blocked as described. Both transfected and untransfected J558L cells were gently triturated to form a single cell suspension and kept at 4 °C to prevent reaggregation. Affinity-purified NgCAM (80 μg/ml) was immobilized on a nitrocellulose-coated 35-mm tissue culture dish. The tissue culture dishes were preincubated at room temperature for 30 min in 0, 10, and 100 mm ethanol. Ethanol was added to the cell suspensions to give final concentrations of 0, 10, and 100 mm ethanol, and 2 × 106cells were added to the corresponding dish. The tissue culture plates were immediately wrapped in parafilm and placed in a 10% CO2 incubator for 2 h. The plates were gently washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.2% glutaraldehyde. A Zeiss microscope equipped with an Image-1 image analysis system was used to quantitate adherent cells. A stock of both transfected and untransfected J558L cells were gently triturated to form a suspension of single cells. Ethanol at various concentrations was added to the cells, and aliquots were placed in Coulter counter vials. Following 30 min of rotation at 30 rpm at 37 °C, cells were fixed with 1.5% glutaraldehyde, and aggregation was assessed by Coulter counter. Control cultures were fixed prior to rotation. The percentage of aggregation was calculated as 100 × (1 − (number of single cells at 30 min/number of single cells at 0 min)). After plating on nitrocellulose-coated dishes to which L1, NgCAM, laminin, or N-cadherin had been adsorbed, cerebellar cultures were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2 to allow for cell adhesion. Ethanol was then added to half of the dishes at the indicated concentrations. Both control and ethanol-containing tissue culture dishes were tightly wrapped in parafilm and placed in separate incubators. The water pan in the incubator of the ethanol-exposed cultures contained the indicated amount of ethanol. The control and ethanol-containing incubators were switched every other experiment. At the indicated times, cerebellar cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Neurons were examined using a Zeiss microscope equipped with an Image-1 image analysis system. Neurite length was measured as the distance between the center of the cell soma and the tip of its longest neurite. The neurite had to meet the following requirements: it must emerge from an isolated cell (not a clump of cells), it must not contact other cells or neurites, and it must be longer than the diameter of the cell body. 100 μl of media following the addition of ethanol and 1 ml of media at the time of fixation were taken to measure the ethanol concentration. Samples were placed in microcentrifuge tubes and stored at 4 °C until ethanol concentration was assayed. In control experiments, the size of the sample did not influence evaporative loss of ethanol. However, storage at −20 °C enhanced the rate of evaporation. Ethanol concentrations was measured in duplicate samples with an ethanol assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined by Pierce Coomassie Blue Plus protein assay. Univariate statistics were used to describe the cell adhesion, cell aggregation, and ethanol concentration data. The main outcome variable, mean neurite length, was determined for each condition from each cell preparation. Since the variable is the mean of greater than 30 measurements, it will be considered a normal distribution, and parametric tests of significance are used. Previous experiments have shown that there is very little variability within one cell preparation, while variability does exist between cell preparations. Therefore, the mean neurite length of all neurites measured under one condition was calculated per cell preparation. Descriptive statistics determined the mean ± S.E. of the mean neurite lengths from multiple cell preparations. Two group comparisons were made using the appropriate t test; comparisons involving more than two groups were made using one-way ANOVA with Duncan's New Range Test for multiple comparisons. For dose-response analyses, results were evaluated from each cell preparation separately to validate the best fit curve observed and confirm similarity of response across cell preparations. Best fit is defined as the simplest appropriate model that has general applicability. The concentrations of ethanol giving half the maximum inhibition (IC50) were predicted from these models. The effect of ethanol on J558L cells transfected with full-length human L1 was first tested on the ability of the cells to adhere to an L1-coated surface that can support L1-mediated adhesion and neurite outgrowth for a variety of neurons (23Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Only L1-transfected cells adhere to the substrate. The addition of either 10 or 100 mm ethanol did not alter the attachment of the cells to the L1 substrate (Fig. 1). To further explore the effect of ethanol on L1 homophilic binding, the cells were then assayed for their ability to self-aggregate (26Wong E. Cheng G. Payne H. Lemmon V. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In previous experiments, aggregation is completed within 30 min in this transfected cell line (26Wong E. Cheng G. Payne H. Lemmon V. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that, in agreement with Fig. 1, less than 10% of untransfected J558L cells self-aggregate at 30 min, whereas 50–60% of transfected cells aggregate. Ethanol in concentrations up to 100 mm had no effect on either transfected or untransfected J558L self-aggregation. Neurite growth of rat cerebellar granule cells was measured over 12 h of culture to measure the effect of ethanol on the functions of L1. The ethanol concentration of the tissue culture dishes was monitored over time. Table I shows the typical ethanol concentration of cultures maintained for 12 h. There was no significant change in the ethanol concentration over the duration of the experiment. When different concentrations of ethanol were required to determine the dose-response relationship of ethanol on neurite outgrowth, preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the concentration of ethanol in the water pan that maintained all ethanol concentrations. The water pan concentration of 25 mm ethanol was found to be optimal for maintaining ethanol concentrations in the tissue culture dishes over the range of ethanol used in this experiment. Table II shows the ethanol concentrations of the tissue culture dishes at 0 and 12 h with 25 mm ethanol in the incubator water pan. Concentrations of ethanol were significantly increased in the media after 12 h for several of the higher concentrations of ethanol. However, for most conditions these increases were not large. In addition, at the lower concentrations of ethanol, the concentration did not change with time.Table IEthanol concentrations of tissue cultures over time of neurite outgrowth assayTimeEthanol concentrationaANOVA, p = 0.77.hmm025.2 ± 18.1220.2 ± 3.1419.8 ± 2.7820.1 ± 2.31221.6 ± 1.9a ANOVA, p = 0.77.

NgCAM was used initially due to its availability. Fig. 3 shows the effect of 17 mm ethanol on the range of neurite lengths of granule cells grown on NgCAM measured at 2, 4, 8, and 12 h. The striking difference in neurite lengths between the control and ethanol-exposed cells becomes apparent at 4 h of culture. The mean neurite length was determined and plotted as a function of time. The results of three separate granule cell preparations are shown in Fig. 4. The mean neurite lengths are significantly shorter for the ethanol-treated cells than the controls at 8 and 12 h.Figure 4Mean neurite length of cells grown on NgCAM as a function of time in the presence of ethanol.

Fig. 5shows the results of ethanol exposure on NgCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth from one such experiment. As can be seen in Fig. 6A, ethanol had no effect on the mean neurite length of cells grown on laminin at the concentrations used by nonlinear regression analysis. However, mean neurite length of cells grown on NgCAM was shorter by approximately 50% at concentrations of ethanol greater than 40 mm, with a half-maximal effect at 4.7 ± 0.4 mm (TableIII). This concentration is similar to the concentration of ethanol giving half-maximal inhibition of cell aggregation (5–7 mm) as reported by Charness et al. (8Charness M.E. Safran R.M. Perides G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9304-9309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Ramanathan et al. (24Ramanathan R. Wilkemeyer M. Mittal B. Perides G. Charness M. J.

Mean neurite length was calculated from data obtained as shown in Fig. 5 for cells grown on either NgCAM (open circles) or laminin (closed squares) and plotted as a function of ethanol concentration. Results shown are from three separate cell preparations (mean ± S.E.). Data points were fit to the nonlinear curve with the best fit. For laminin, within these concentrations of ethanol, the curve was a straight line with no slope.

After a further 12-h incubation, cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde, and neurite length was measured.Symbols represent five separate preparations of cells.

A possible strategy to fight these bacteria would be a combined therapy with non-toxic inhibitors of Zn2+-β-lactamases together with standard antibiotics. For this purpose, it is important to verify that the inhibitor is effective under all clinical conditions. We have investigated the correlation between the number of zinc ions bound to the Zn2+-β-lactamase from Bacillus cereus and hydrolysis of benzylpenicillin and nitrocefin for the wild type and a mutant where cysteine 168 is replaced by alanine. It is shown that both the mono-Zn2+ (mononuclear) and di-Zn2+(binuclear) Zn2+-β-lactamases are catalytically active but with different kinetic properties. The mono-Zn2+-β-lactamase requires the conserved cysteine residue for hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring in contrast to the binuclear enzyme where the cysteine residue is not essential. Substrate affinity is not significantly affected by the mutation for the mononuclear enzyme but is decreased for the binuclear enzyme. These results were derived from kinetic studies on two wild types and the mutant enzyme with benzylpenicillin and nitrocefin as substrates.

Zn2+-β-lactamases catalyze the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics by cleaving their β-lactam rings. The production of Zn2+-β-lactamases most often renders bacteria resistant to almost all β-lactam drugs so far designed, including carbapenems. Some of these organisms like Bacteroides fragilis, Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophilia are human pathogens (1Payne D.J. J. Med. Microbiol. 1993; 39: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the search for useful inhibitors for clinical purposes has become of major importance.The structures of Zn2+-β-lactamases from Bacillus cereus strain 569/H/9 and B. fragilis have been solved by x-ray crystallography (2Carfi A.

The zinc ligands are His-86, His-88, and His-149 at the first site (the “three His” site) and those of His-210, Asp-90, and Cys-168 at the second, Cys, site. These residues are highly conserved in almost all the enzymes of the family for which sequence data are available. The first crystal structure of the B. cereusenzyme, solved at pH 5.6 and 293 K, showed one zinc ion in the first site (2Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frere J.-M. Dideberg O.

https://openalex.org/W1976259855,"The ADAMs (adisintegrinand metalloprotease) are a family of multidomain proteins that are believed to play key roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. We have shown recently that human ADAM 12-S (meltrin α) is an active metalloprotease. It is synthesized as a zymogen, with the prodomain maintaining the protease in a latent form. We now provide evidence that the latency mechanism of ADAM 12 can be explained by the cysteine switch model, in which coordination of Zn2+ in the active site of the catalytic domain by a cysteine residue in the prodomain is critical for inhibition of the protease. Replacing Cys179 with other amino acids results in an ADAM 12 proform that is proteolytically active, but latency can be restored by placing cysteine at other positions in the propeptide. None of the amino acids adjacent to the crucial cysteine residue is essential for blocking activity of the protease domain. In addition to its latency function, the prodomain is required for exit of ADAM 12 protease from the endoplasmic reticulum. Tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1, -2, and -3 were not found to block proteolytic activity of ADAM 12, hence a physiological inhibitor of ADAM 12 protease in the extracellular environment remains to be identified.

Together with snake venom metalloproteases, they make up the reprolysin family of zinc metalloproteases (1Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev.

The archetypical ADAM protein has a prodomain, metalloprotease domain, disintegrin-like domain, cysteine-rich region, and in the case of membrane-anchored ADAMs, a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain. We recently made use of an α2-macroglobulin (α2M) trapping assay to demonstrate that human ADAM 12-S, the secreted form of ADAM 12, is an active metalloprotease (6Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Members of the metzincin superfamily of metalloproteases, including the reprolysins and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), are synthesized as inactive precursors, in which an NH2-terminal prodomain is responsible for maintaining latency of the protease (7Nagase H. Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteases in Health and Disease. Taylor and Francis, London1996: 153-204Google Scholar, 8Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). MMPs are generally secreted as proenzymes; the latent proform is subsequently converted to the active form by proteolytic cleavage of the prodomain. In contrast, it appears that ADAM proteases are converted from a latent proform to an active enzyme before secretion as a result of cleavage of the prodomain by furin or related proteases in thetrans-Golgi (6Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Moss M.L. Jin S.L. Milla M.E. Burkhart W.

Seaton T. Su J.L. Warner J. Willard D. Becherer J.D. Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). The prodomain of all MMPs contains a highly conserved cysteine residue that is part of the mechanism for the blocking activity of the proenzyme (3Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). This cysteine residue coordinates the zinc ion located at the active site of the catalytic domain and is the basis for the proposed “cysteine switch” model of repression/activation for MMPs (10Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 11Van Wart H.E. Birkedal Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). The key cysteine residue of the prodomain is also highly conserved in snake venom metalloproteases as well as in those members of the ADAMs family which have been demonstrated to be active proteases (1Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 3Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J.

It is therefore likely that a similar cysteine switch is part of the mechanism by which the activity of these proteases is regulated. It is not clear to what extent the regulatory activity of an ADAM or MMP prodomain should be attributed to cysteine coordination of the active site zinc and how much is the result of interaction of other regions of the prodomain with sites in the metalloprotease domain. Treatment of pro-MMPs with thiol-modifying agents results in activation with ensuing autocleavage of the propeptide (10Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 14Sang Q.X. Birkedal Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This supports the view that the cysteine-zinc interaction is the key one. On the other hand, Chen et al. (15Chen L.C. Noelken M.E. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10289-10295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that disruption of the zinc-cysteine interaction in MMP-3 by chemical modification of the cysteine was not sufficient to activate the proenzyme, whereas subsequent treatment with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate did result in activation (15Chen L.C. Noelken M.E. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10289-10295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This suggests that, at least in the case of MMP-3, the prodomain is capable of performing its role of maintaining latency even in the absence of a cysteine switch. Single amino acid substitutions in the cysteine switch region of MMP proenzymes, whether of the cysteine itself or of adjacent amino acids, have been shown to result in spontaneous activation of the proenzyme (16Park A.J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The details of how the cysteine switch functions in MMP proenzymes have therefore not been fully resolved, and the relative importance of the cysteine switch to the latency mechanism of ADAM proteases remains an open question. We decided to explore whether the cysteine switch model can explain latency of the ADAM 12-S proenzyme. Our approach was to substitute amino acids in the prodomain, based on what has been learned from previous studies on MMPs, and to determine the effect this had on protease activity of the ADAM 12 proenzyme, using α2M as a substrate. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Nonidet P-40 were from Sigma. BB-94 and BB-3103 were from British Biotech Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Oxford, United Kingdom). Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Recombinant human tissue inhibitors of metalloprotease (TIMP)-1, -2, and -3 were provided by Gillian Murphy (University of East Anglia, Norwich, U. K.); they were expressed in NS0 mouse myeloma cells and purified as described previously (19Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 20Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R.

Plasmids for expression of full-length ADAM 12-S (p1151), for expression of the same protein lacking a furin cleavage site at the junction between the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain (p1197), and for expression of ADAM 12-S lacking both the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain (p1095) have been described previously (6Loechel F.

Nucleotide and amino acid numbering is according to the ADAM 12-S sequence deposited in the GenBank data base (accession number AF023477). Plasmids coding for ADAM 12 proteins with amino acid substitutions in the cysteine switch region were constructed as follows. First, plasmid 1197 was modified to give two unique restriction sites in place of the codons for amino acids 177–183. This was done using the method described previously by performing strand overlap polymerase chain reaction on plasmid 1197 to generate a PmlI DNA fragment (nucleotides 716–2163) containing the desired mutation and using this to replace the wild-type PmlI DNA fragment in plasmid 1151 (6Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid (p1265) contains, in addition to the mutated furin cleavage site, the sequence GTC CGC GGA GTT AAC, which represents the codon for Val175 followed by a KspI site and an HpaI site. Ligation of an appropriate double-stranded oligonucleotide to p1265 digested with KspI and HpaI allowed insertion of the desired codons. A modified form of plasmid 1265 was prepared containing a Glu351 → Gln mutation to eliminate catalytic activity. Insertion of the appropriate double-stranded oligonucleotide at theKspI/HpaI sites yielded plasmid 1376, coding for full-length ADAM 12-S with a mutated furin cleavage site and the Glu351 → Gln mutation, and plasmid 1377, containing these mutations plus a Cys179 → His mutation in the cysteine switch. A plasmid for the expression of an ADAM 12-S polypeptide lacking the prodomain (p1229) was constructed using the pSecTagB vector (Invitrogen). A DNA fragment containing nucleotides 925–2523 of human ADAM 12-S, with a BamHI site at the 5′-end and anXbaI site at the 3′-end, was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). It was inserted at the BamHI/XbaI sites of pSecTagB. The resulting polypeptide contains an Ig κ-chain signal peptide at the NH2 terminus followed by amino acids 207–738 of ADAM 12-S (metalloprotease, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich domains). Table I provides an overview of these ADAM 12-S expression plasmids. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used throughout (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequences of the oligonucleotide primers are available from the authors upon request. Sequencing to confirm the accuracy of the mutations was performed using the Vistra DNA Sequencer 725 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Table IADAM 12-S expression plasmidsPlasmidDescription1151Full-length, wild-type human ADAM 12-S1197Mutated furin cleavage site: two amino acids at the prodomain/catalytic domain junction were changed to eliminate cleavage by furin1214, 1336Mutated furin cleavage site and a mutated cysteine switch (Cys179 → Ala or His)1376Mutated furin cleavage site and Glu351 → Gln mutation to eliminate catalytic activity1377Mutated furin cleavage site, mutated cysteine switch (Cys179 → His), and Glu351 → Gln mutation to eliminate catalytic activity1229ADAM 12-S lacking the prodomain; contains Ig κ-chain signal peptide1095ADAM 12-S lacking both the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain; contains Ig κ-chain signal peptideAdditional plasmids are listed in Tables II and III and correspond to plasmid 1197 with various amino acid substitutions in the cysteine switch of the prodomain.

COS-7 cells were transfected with ADAM 12-S expression plasmids by electroporation as described previously (6Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, cells were grown in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48–72 h post-transfection, the medium was harvested, concentrated 10-fold using an Amicon Centricon-10 filter, and processed for SDS-PAGE. To evaluate ADAM 12 polypeptides located intracellularly, a cell extract was prepared by washing the cell layer with phosphate-buffered saline and lysing by incubation in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40 on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 7,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was prepared for SDS-PAGE. Samples were denatured and reduced by boiling in SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol, subjected to SDS-PAGE on Tris-glycine gels (Novex) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated either with the 14E3 monoclonal antibody specific for the ADAM 12 cysteine-rich region or with rabbit antiserum 104 specific for the same region (21Gilpin B.J. Loechel F.

After incubation with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated second antibody, detection was performed using the chemiluminescence SuperSignal kit from Pierce or the ECL-Plus kit from Amersham. Deglycosylation was performed on denatured protein that had been boiled in SDS sample buffer. Protein was precipitated with 8 volumes of acetone to remove excess SDS. The protein pellet was resuspended by boiling in 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% SDS for 2 min. One aliquot was diluted with an equal volume of 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40. EDTA was added to 10 mm, and digestion with N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was performed for 16 h at 30 °C. One aliquot was diluted with an equal volume of 100 mmsodium citrate (pH 5.5), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 5 mm, and digestion with endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was performed for 16 h at 30 °C. The α2M complex formation assay was used (23Nagase H. Itoh Y. Binner S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

ADAM 12 protein from transfected COS-7 cells was prepared in serum-free medium (UltraDOMA medium from BioWhittaker) and concentrated 10-fold using an Amicon Centricon-10 filter. Assays were carried out in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide. The α2M substrate was added either in the form of fetal bovine serum at a final concentration of 25% or purified α2M at a concentration of 1 μg/μl. ADAM 12 proforms were alkylated by the addition of 1 mm NEM and incubation at 20 °C for 15 min before the addition of α2M. Reactions were terminated after incubation at 37 °C for 16 h by boiling in SDS sample buffer as described above. The ability of ADAM 12-S protease to react with α2M purified from three different sources was tested. Adult human and bovine α2M was purified as described previously (26Dolmer K. Jenner L.B. Jacobsen L. Andersen G.R. Koch T.J. Thirup S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Nyborg J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Fetal bovine α2M was purified by a slightly modified procedure. Briefly, fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) was precipitated with PEG-6000, and the 4–20% precipitate was redissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column. The column was eluted with a linear gradient from 10 to 300 mm sodium chloride. α2M-containing fractions, as determined by a protease protection assay, were pooled and loaded on a Zn2+-iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose 4B column. The column was washed with 2 volumes of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride (pH 7.0) and eluted with 100 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). As a final step, the eluate was fractionated on a Superose 6 column in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, resulting in 95% pure α2M as judged by SDS-PAGE. All column materials were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All preparations contained 3.7–3.9 thiol esters/α2M tetramer, as measured by the appearance of thiols upon treatment with methylamine. Because side-by-side assays showed that human α2M was cleaved more efficiently than either fetal or adult bovine α2M in purified form, all assays described in this study were performed either with purified human α2M or fetal bovine serum. We reported previously that an ADAM 12-S proenzyme with a mutated cysteine switch did not react with purified bovine α2M (6Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This was apparently the result of the preparation of bovine α2M used in the previous study because bovine α2M, when purified and used as above, demonstrated unequivocal activity both with wild-type ADAM 12-S and mutant ADAM 12-S proenzymes. The relative efficiency of cleavage, however, was often higher for the former. We employed the α2M trapping assay that we used previously to demonstrate that human ADAM 12 is an active metalloprotease (6Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Fig. 1Ashows the results of a typical assay, in which ADAM 12/α2M reaction products were detected by immunoblotting with an antibody specific for ADAM 12. When wild-type ADAM 12-S encoded by plasmid 1151 was secreted by cells growing in serum-containing medium, both a 92- and a 68-kDa form were seen, representing the latent proform and the catalytically active protease, respectively. The majority of the protein was found in the furin-cleaved 68-kDa form. A cluster of highM r bands is evident, which results from proteolytic cleavage of α2M followed by covalent cross-linking of ADAM 12 to α2M via its thiol ester (Fig. 1A, lane 1). To be able to assess the proteolytic activity of the ADAM 12-S proform, two amino acid residues at the junction between the ADAM 12 prodomain and metalloprotease domain were mutated (plasmid 1197), thereby eliminating the furin cleavage site. As we have shown previously, cells transfected with plasmid 1197 secreted the 92-kDa proform, consisting of the prodomain, metalloprotease domain, and disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains (6Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This proform is a latent protease and therefore does not react with α2M, as evidenced by the absence of the characteristic high M r bands (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The prodomain of ADAM 12 contains a conserved cysteine residue at position 179 which is predicted to participate in the cysteine switch for maintaining latency of the protease domain. When an ADAM 12-S proform containing a Cys179 → Ala mutation (plasmid 1214) was secreted to serum-containing medium, the presence of α2M reaction products showed that this proform is a constitutively active rather than a latent protease (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Consistent results were obtained when assays were performed by first preparing ADAM 12-S protein in serum-free medium and then adding α2M in the form of fetal bovine serum (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–9). In addition, these assays showed that the latent ADAM 12-S proform encoded by plasmid 1197 could be activated by treatment with NEM, which presumably alkylates the free cysteine in the prodomain, thereby destroying the cysteine switch (Fig. 1A, lane 7). NEM treatment had no significant effect on activity of the 68-kDa form nor on activity of the proform containing the Cys179 → Ala mutation. Purified human α2M reacted with ADAM 12-S in a similar fashion. It is a more efficient substrate than the preparation of purified bovine α2M which we used in a previous study; the intensity of the α2M reaction products is comparable to that obtained with fetal bovine serum and clearly shows the proteolytic activity of the proform containing the Cys179 → Ala mutation (Fig. 1B, lane 3). The reaction products of α2M with the proenzyme encoded by plasmid 1214 are larger than those generated by the wild-type ADAM-12 protease, as would be expected for complexes containing 92-kDa rather than 68-kDa ADAM 12 polypeptides. Transfection with ADAM 12-S proform plasmids often yielded an additional band that migrated at 68 kDa in addition to the strong band at 92 kDa (Fig. 1, panel A, lanes 7–9 and panel B, lane 3). It is conceivable that this band represents active ADAM 12-S protease, generated either by inefficient cleavage by furin at an alternate site or by autocleavage of the ADAM 12 proenzyme (see next “Results” section). Some of the α2M reaction products generated by activated ADAM 12 proforms comigrated with the products of wild-type ADAM 12 polypeptide (Fig. 1A, lanes 7–9) and possibly derive from reaction of 68-kDa rather than 92-kDa polypeptides. Therefore, for the purpose of evaluating whether a given ADAM 12-S proform was proteolytically active, we judged it to be active only in the event that it produced α2M reaction products larger than those produced by the wild-type 68-kDa polypeptide. We proceeded to generate a series of proforms with various amino acid substitutions in the cysteine switch region, centered around Cys179. A proform that did not react with α2M was judged to be a latent protease on the condition that it reacted after treatment with NEM. A proform that reacted with α2M when secreted into serum-containing medium or when prepared in serum-free medium that was subsequently incubated with α2M in the absence of NEM was judged to be a constitutively active protease, in which the cysteine switch of the prodomain had been inactivated by the amino acid substitution. Mutants of the ADAM 12-S proform were expressed in COS cells and assayed for proteolytic activity. The results are summarized in TableII. The polypeptide encoded by plasmid 1197 has the wild-type ADAM 12 cysteine switch, and it has no activity unless assayed in the presence of NEM. Replacing Cys179with alanine or histidine yields a constitutively active protease (mutants 1214 and 1336). Cysteine is therefore essential for a functional cysteine switch and cannot be replaced even by an amino acid such as histidine, which is capable of coordinating zinc. The two histidine residues in the vicinity of Cys179 could conceivably be involved in coordination of the active site Zn2+, similar to the way in which three histidines of the protease domain bind to Zn2+. However, mutant 1313 shows that changing these two amino acids does not affect the ability of the prodomain to maintain latency. Gly180 is highly conserved among members of the metzincin superfamily, but mutant 1358 demonstrates that it is not essential for function of the ADAM 12 cysteine switch. Finally, replacement of the ADAM 12 cysteine switch with the cysteine switch of ADAM 17 or with a consensus snake venom metalloprotease or MMP cysteine switch, yields a fully functional prodomain. We conclude that cysteine is the crucial amino acid of the ADAM 12 cysteine switch and that none of the adjacent amino acid residues is essential.Table IIProtease activity of ADAM 12-S proforms with amino acid substitutions in the cysteine switch of the prodomainPlasmidCysteine switchAmino acid residues 177–183Protease activityProtease activity with NEM1197ADAM 12G S C G S H HNoaNo, no α2M reaction products were observed either when secreted into serum-containing medium or when prepared in serum-free medium and then incubated with fetal bovine serum.Yes1214Cys179 → AlaG S A G S H HYesbYes, α2M reaction products were observed, as described under “Results.”NRcNR, not relevant.1336Cys179 → HisG S H G S H HYesNR1313HH → QQG S C G S Q QNoYes1358Gly180 → AlaG S C A S H HNoYes1312ADAM 17G V C G Y L KNoYes1311SVMPdSVMP, snake venom metalloprotease.consensusG M C G V T GNoYes1314MMP consensusP R C G V P DNoYesThese ADAM 12 polypeptides all contain the KR207 → NG mutation to prevent cleavage of the prodomain by furin.

Note that for mutants 1312 and 1311, Gly177 is not part of the consensus sequence. Replacing Cys179 with Ala results in an inactivated cysteine switch (mutant 1214). We next asked whether an active cysteine switch could be re-created in the prodomain by placing a cysteine residue in the vicinity of position 179. A series of ADAM 12 proforms was generated in which this inactive cysteine switch was modified by substituting cysteine for the adjacent amino acid residues one at a time. The results are presented in TableIII. When cysteine was present at positions −1, +1, or +2 relative to the wild-type position, the result was a constitutively active protease, i.e. the cysteine switch was nonfunctional. A prodomain containing cysteine at position +3 or +4 was functionally indistinguishable from the wild-type prodomain (mutants 1335 and 1343 compared with 1197). Therefore, not only is cysteine the key amino acid residue, but there is a certain flexibility in its position in the prodomain. Together, these data demonstrate that the latency mechanism of the ADAM 12 prodomain can be explained by the cysteine switch model as proposed in 1990 for MMPs (10Springman E.B. Angleton E.L.

https://openalex.org/W2002956809,"The recent use of calcein (CA) as a fluorescent probe for cellular iron has been shown to reflect the nutritional status of iron in mammalian cells (Breuer, W., Epsztejn, S., and Cabantchik, Z.

We first study here the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of iron binding by CA. Chelation of a first iron(III) involves one aminodiacetic arm and a phenol.

We discuss the interest of quantifying iron buffers in biochemical studies of iron, in vitro as well as in cells. Physiologists have described many examples of cells that present symptoms of iron deficiency, although containing large amounts of iron (1Becker R. Eberhard F. Manteuffel R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In order to explain the capricious biological efficiency of cellular iron, an ill defined key operator of iron metabolism, the so called “chelatable” or “labile iron pool” (LIP), 1The abbreviation used is: LIP, labile iron pool; CA, calcein; SCE, standard calome electrode; CAH, monoprotonated calcein; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. has been invoked (2.Crichton, R. (1991) in Inorganic Biochemistry of Iron Metabolism (Horwod, E., ed) pp. 131–172.Google Scholar). The LIP is the available cellular iron to which has been assigned at least four functions: (a) cellular iron transport, (b) expression of iron regulatory genes (transferrin receptor, ferritin), (c) control of the activity of iron containing proteins, (d) catalysis of the Fenton reactions (3Fontecave M. Pierre J.L. Biol. Met. 1991; 4: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). How much iron is available? How tightly is it bound and to which biological ligands? Cabantchik et al. (4Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24209-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) have recently used a fluorescent probe that may be an opportune tool to measure the LIP. They have shown that calcein (CA; see structure formula in Fig. 3) is dynamically sensitive to metabolic changes of iron pools, under various nutritional conditions. Its use is therefore a methodological breakthrough. Nevertheless, they assumed that thermodynamic data concerning iron (III and II) complexation with calcein were the same as those of EDTA, because calcein and EDTA both carry diaminetetraacetic chelating arms (4Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24209-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). By the use of acetoxymethyl esters of CA, they could discriminate endocellular signals. Since calcein chelates cellular iron which is shared by all the complexes of the same compartment, the level of fluorescence of free calcein reflects the variations of the available iron of the compartment (4Breuer W.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Such an approach is reminiscent of the model based on the notion of metal buffers and pFe calculations, 2pFe = −log[Fe] = log β110+ log ([L]T αFeL/αL[FeL]T), where β110 is the overall stability constant for the Fe + L ⇄ FeL equilibrium, [L]T = [L] +[FeL], [FeL]T = [Fe] + [FeL], and αFeL and αL are the Ringbom coefficients (22Ringbom A. in Complexation in Analytical Chemistry. Interscience, New York1963Google Scholar). Chaberek and Martell (11Chaberek S. Martell A.E. Organic Sequestering Agents. John Wiley & Sons, New York1959: 174-215Google Scholar) and others adopted this logarithmic notation as convenient for low values and reminiscent of the familiar pH scale. In the presence of free ligand, a metal concentration is buffered. Its concentration (i.e. pFe) is least affected by disturbances, which tend to add or to remove metal ions from the medium. Raymond and co-workers (15Harris W.R. Raymond K.N. Weitl F.L. J. Am. Chem.

CRC Press, London1991: 177-232Google Scholar); biochemical iron exchanges can be regarded as the result of competitions for iron between cellular ligands, according to their various affinities. The biosynthesis of iron ligands during growth of cells creates a driving force for the nutritional uptake of the metal. Then, after iron uptake, the competition of iron complexes with free ligands leaves only trace amounts of iron ions, in equilibrium with all the iron potential ligands. Within each cellular compartment, in which diffusion occurs freely, a single overall concentration of unchelated residual iron results from these multiple equilibria; it can be expressed as pFe. The term pFe is the best quantitative expression of the overall concentrations of unchelated iron in solution, in specific pH and ionic strength conditions. CA is a fluorescent chemosensor that could reflect these equilibria. First attempts to measure pFeIII in plant cells have been made by competition experiments between radiolabeled standard iron buffers and cellular ligands (18Laulhère J.P. Devillers P. Pierron M. Physiol. Veg. 1972; 10: 589-598Google Scholar), but these measurements were done after disruption of cellular compartments and therefore had lost most of their physiological significance. Nondestructive tools are needed for pFeIII and pFeII determinations. The aim of this work is to complement the cytological approach which uses calcein as a chemosensor, by establishing the thermodynamic and kinetic data concerning iron(III and II) complexation with calcein. We then discuss the use of CA as a fluorescent probe for studying the pools of ferrous and ferric iron. A new application using CA for measurements of the kinetics of iron(III) nutrition of plant cells is developed, and a physiological study of CA as a nutritional siderophore is presented. All the measurements were made at 25 °C. The ionic strength was fixed at 0.1 m with sodium perchlorate. Potentiometric titration employed a DMS 716 Titrino (Metrohm) equipped with glass and calomel electrodes and connected to an IBM Aptiva microcomputer. The electrodes were calibrated to read pH according to the classical method. A calcein solution and a 1:1 Fe(III):calcein solution of ∼0.001 m were titrated with standardized 0.05m sodium hydroxide. The titration data were refined by the nonlinear least squares refinement program SUPERQUAD (19Gans P. Sabatini A. Vacca A. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1985; : 1195-1200Crossref Google Scholar) to determine the equilibrium constants. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Lambda 2 Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer. Light path length is 1 cm. The acquisition was made with the UV Winlab Perkin-Elmer software. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C with the variable temperature unit. For calcein-iron spectrophotometric titrations, 0.1 miron(III) perchlorate in 0.1 m HClO4 solution was added to a 10−4m calcein solution (0.05m Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 0.05 m NaClO4); pH was controlled before and after each measurements. Iron concentration was obtained spectrophotometrically by using a molar extinction coefficient ε = 4160m−1·cm−1 at 240 nm (20Bastian R. Weberling R. Palilla F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 459-462Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar); CA concentration was obtained by using the molar extinction coefficient provided by Molecular Probes. The total volume was 500 μl, and its variations due to iron additions from stock solutions were less than 2%. Equilibria after competitions were measured using the same equipment. A Biologic SFM3 stopped flow module (Claix, France), controlled by a Tandom computer using Biokine software, is used for stopped flow kinetic experiments. Its temperature control unit (M3 Lauda) is set at 25 °C. EPR studies have been conducted using a ESP 300E Bruker apparatus with a variable temperature unit. Spectra were treated by using either the software of the apparatus or the winEPR software (Bruker). Each sample (200 μl) contained 10% glycerol, 0.1m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.2, 10−3mcalcein, and increasing amounts of iron(III) perchlorate. Temperature was 100 K and field was scanned from 1000 to 5000 gauss. The electrochemical investigations by cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed in 0.05 mTris-Cl, pH 7.2, 0.05 m NaClO4 aqueous solution containing millimolar concentration of the iron(III)-calcein complex. CV curves were recorded using a EGG 273 Potentiostat coupled with a Kipp & Zonen x-y recorder. Electrochemical experiments were performed in a three-compartment cell, at room temperature, under an argon atmosphere. Potential are referred to an aqueous SCE reference electrode. The working electrode was a vitrous carbon disc (5 mm diameter) polished with 1-μm diamond paste. The 1:1 FeII + CA solution for UV-visible spectrophotometry and fluorimetric experiments has been prepared under argon in a glove box, starting from the solids (CA, FeII as (NH4)2(SO4)2Fe·6H2O) and a degassed 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, solution. The FeII + CA solution was diluted to the appropriate concentration and placed into an hermetically closed quartz cell. Cells were taken out to the fluorimeter or the spectrophotometer, and their spectra were recorded. This prevents further Fe2+oxidation, but not ferric contaminants from the powders. Plant cells were grown in 24-well sterile cell culture plates (Nunc); each independent axenic culture contains 1.5 ml of culture medium. This medium (MS) was a modified Murashige and Skoog (21Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473Crossref Scopus (53969) Google Scholar): for 1000 ml of medium: 4.3 g of macro- and micro-elements powder (provided by Duchefa, catalog number M0221, Haarlem, Netherlands), 10 ml of H2KPO4(20 g/liter), 0.5 ml; kinetin (0.1 g/l), 0.5 ml; (2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid (0.2 g/liter); 1 ml × 1000 vitamin solution (Duchefa M 0409), and 30 g of saccharose. Iron-free MS medium (MS-Fe) has the same content, made from reagent grade products, omitting FeIIIEDTA. Calcein is commercially available (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Wells were inoculated at an absorbance of 0.003 (∼112) with early stationary phaseArabidopsis thaliana (var. Columbia) cell suspensions. For axeny, plates where sealed with “Magic Scotch®” tape. 24-well plates were agitated at 220 rpm at 25 °C in a New Brunswik “innova” 4230 refrigerated incubator shaker. Light was supplied 18 h a day by two growlux Sylvania 15-watt fluorescent tubes in the “photosynthesis” accessory. The measurements of cell density were made daily. It was often hampered by the occurrence of condensation droplets on the cover of the 12-well plates. To minimize light scattering during densitometry, the digitized images of the cultures were recorded from beneath through a mirror. The Bio-Rad video camera system Geldoc 1000 was used, with the “molecular analyst” software for quantification. To record images of the plates, the hood of the camera was rotated to a horizontal position. A mirror was introduced through the open door of the hood, at 45° across the horizontal light path, held by a special stand, which also maintained the 12-well culture plate horizontally on a glass plate and held the Geldoc light source, upside down, 10 cm above the cultures. Full frame images were captured in constant light conditions, i.e.white light being adjusted so that just a few saturated pixels appeared in red in the empty optical field. In these conditions, a reproducible relationship was found between the absorbance of wells in densitometric scanning profiles of recorded images and the amount of cells in the wells. Images of culture plates without cells were used as base-line reference. They showed an uneven light background. This fact was compensated by the subtraction of an adapted base line. Measurements and base-line profiles were drawn using the rectangle tool of the image analysis software. Base lines were drawn by joining the crest highlight points in each image between the wells and then subtracted. This method was found more accurate and reproducible than the use of 24 grids or the elliptical objects tools proposed by the software. When possible and necessary, condensation was fully eliminated by replacement of the cover in axenic conditions. Cells remained in their culture plates during fluorimetric iron uptake measurements. Respiration of the cells was maintained by aeration of the iron uptake medium in the return tubing from the fluorimeter cuvette to the plate. Prior to fluorimetric measurements, cells were drained by pressing a plastic pipette on the bottom of the wells and by aspiration of the culture medium through this leaky filtering contact. After three washes and drainings with iron-free culture medium (MS-Fe), the well was ready to be connected to a 7-ml circuit, filled with the iron uptake medium IUM (IUM = iron-free culture medium (MS-Fe) supplemented with Tris-maleate NaOH buffer (0.02 m), pH 5.8, 4·10−7m CA, and 2·10−7m ammonium iron(II) sulfate; the iron-CA complex was synthesized previously at low pH and in a 100 times more concentrated solution. It fully oxidizes upon dilution at pH 5.8. IUM is stored in 50-ml fractions at −20 °C, protected from light, and used immediately after thawing. An aspiration filter made with a 20-μl pipette tip filled with glass wool is connected to a peristaltic pump. The medium is pumped out at a rate of 0.42 ml·min−1 into the cuvette of the fluorimeter. The rate of the return pumping was twice as fast, therefore air was swallowed by the tubing, allowing both the level control in the cuvette and an intimate aeration of the medium. The filter was agitated to prevent cell stacking and to improve aeration. The 400-μl cuvette of the fluorimeter (Jobin-Yvon Spec Fluoromax) is connected to the circuit with two Teflon tubes. The drained cells received 1.5 ml of IUM and were connected to the 7-ml fluorimeter circuit described above. Excitation was made at 488 nm (slit: 1.5 nm) and emission recorded at 511 nm (slit: 2 nm). After recording the initial fluorescence level in the absence of cells for 200 s, the culture well and cuvette circuit were connected, and changes of fluorescence were recorded kinetically. The same spectrofluorimeter was used for in vitro iron exchange studies. The thermodynamic analysis of the Fe(III)-calcein complexation equilibria required the determination of the ligand deprotonation constants and an equilibrium study of the ferric complexes as a function of the pH. The deprotonation constants of the ligand have been determined by potentiometric (Fig. 1) and UV-visible spectrophotometric titrations. Analysis of the titration curves yield the pK a values: 3.09 (3Fontecave M. Pierre J.L. Biol. Met. 1991; 4: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 3.67 (3Fontecave M. Pierre J.L. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (from spectrophotometry). Numbers in parentheses represent the S.D. in the last significant digit. ThepK a values of three out of four of the carboxylic acids of the aminodiacetic moieties are too low to be determined from potentiometric measurement. The potentiometric titration curve of a 1:1 iron(III):calcein solution (Fig. 1) exhibited a buffer region ata = 3–4 (a is the number of moles of added base per moles of ligand) over the pH range 5–7. Another buffer region is found at a = 4–5 over the pH range 8–9, indicating that the predominant species at pH < 8 is the monoprotonated complex, FeIIICAH. Its pK a has been determined to be 8.90 (5Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik Z.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from the analysis of the titration curve. The precipitation of the complex below pH 5 precluded the use of the titration data in refinement program. The complex stability constant was thus determined from spectrophotometric competition. The UV-visible spectrum of the FeIIICAH complex at pH 7.2 exhibits a band at 500 nm with a shoulder at 600 nm (Fig. 2)Figure 2A, equilibrium competition of equimolar amounts (1.5·10−4m) of FeIIICAH, with EDTA, or NTA or citrate, kept in the dark for 4 days at 25 °C pH 7.2 in 0.05 m Tris-Cl, 0.05 m NaClO4.B, UV-visible spectra of FeIII complexes of EDTA, calcein blue, and calcein; concentrations are 0.45·10−3m, 0.1 M Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.2, 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Competitions were carried out in order to determine the relative efficiency of calcein and EDTA, NTA, and citrate anions with regard to iron chelation and were observed spectrophotometrically. The FeIIICAH solution was obtained by adding equimolar amount of Fe(III) perchlorate to CA at low pH, followed by a 0.05m Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 0.05 m NaClO4buffer. Equimolar amounts of FeIIICAH complex and tested ligands were left in the dark for 4 days at 25 °C. The reverse exchange was done using the tested iron complex in competition with calcein. UV-visible light spectra were recorded when exchanges in both directions had led to similar results. The spectra in Fig. 2A show (i) a complete transfer of iron from FeIIICAH to EDTA; (ii) an exchange with citrate, too low for quantification; (iii) a significant exchange with NTA allowing the quantification of iron(III) distribution between the two competing ligands and the calculation of thermodynamic constants. In addition, similar experiments were made in the presence of 2, 5, 10, and 20 molar eq of NTA with respect to FeIIICAH. The metal displaced was measured to be 33% in the presence of 20 NTA eq. The competition equilibrium can be expressed by the following equations:FeCAH+NTA⇄FeNTA+CA+H+(Eq. 1) with K = ([FeNTA]tot[CA]tot[H+])/([FeCAH]tot[NTA]tot)·(αNTA/(αFeNTA·αCA)) and K = (β110FeNTA/β111FeCAH)·(αNTA/αFeNTA·αCA)), where FeNTA, CA, and NTA refer to all forms of FeIIIcomplexed with NTA, free CA, and free NTA, at equilibrium and pH 7.2, respectively. Here α's are the usual Ringbom coefficients (22Ringbom A. in Complexation in Analytical Chemistry. Interscience, New York1963Google Scholar) calculated from the deprotonation constants of the ligands CA and NTA (23Martell A. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. Plenum Press, New York1974Google Scholar) or from the complexation constants of FeIIINTA (23Martell A. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. Plenum Press, New York1974Google Scholar). The average formation constant log β111 of FeIIICA was determined to be 33.9(1). The typical pFeIII value of calcein was calculated to be 20.3 (pH = 7.4, [Fe]tot = 1 μm, [ligand]tot = 10 μm). It is thus clear that FeIIICAH is almost a thousandfold weaker complex than FeIIIEDTA(pFeIIIFeEDTA = 23.5). The UV-visible spectrum FeIIICAH exhibits a phenol to iron charge transfer band at 600 nm (ε = 900m−1·cm−1), which is not present in the FeIIIEDTA spectrum (Fig. 2). In order to gain information about the mode of coordination of the calcein with Fe(III), the spectrum was compared with that of the FeIIIcalcein blue. Calcein blue is a fluorescent ligand having a single aminediacetic complexing arm (see Fig. 3) instead of the two complexing arms of the diaminetetraacetic in EDTA and calcein. The UV-visible spectrum of FeIIIcalcein blue (Fig. 2B) exhibits a phenolate to iron charge transfer band at 490 nm. FeIIICAH thus provides a coordination to iron significantly different from EDTA unlike suggested previously (4Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24209-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Differences in coordination were also shown by EPR spectra of FeIIIcomplexes of CA, EDTA, and calcein blue at pH 7.2; EPR spectra of calcein and calcein blue are similar, as shown in Fig. 3(the differential spectrum is very close to the base line). They are both centered at g = 4.293, and they are dissymmetric. The spectrum of FeIIIEDTA is symmetrical and centered at g = 4.272. These results suggest a coordination with one aminodiacetic arm and the phenolate group of the calcein, while the second aminediacetic arm remains uncoordinated. Since its amine pK a has been determined to be 9.6 in the free ligand, it is still protonated at pH 7.2. Consequently, calcein is found to act as a tetradentate ligand like calcein blue. Then, the question is raised of the possible binding of a second iron cation by the second aminodiacetic arm. During the spectrophotometric titration of CA by iron(III), a sharp and intense peak at 550 nm increased up to the addition of 2 eq (Fig. 4). EPR titration experiments were performed under the same experimental conditions. Fig. 5 shows that the EPR signal intensity reaches a maximum at one iron equivalent per ligand and then decreases until it vanishes when 2 eq of iron have been added. It can be assumed that two successive bindings of iron cation occur, involving the two aminodiacetic arms. The diferric complex is EPR silent revealing antiferromagnetic coupling of the two iron ions. Further physiological experiments will be limited to conditions where only one iron(III) cation is complexed. CV was performed in a 5 mm aqueous solution of the 1:1 FeII and FeIIIcalcein complex in the presence of 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 0.1 mNaClO4 as supporting buffered electrolyte. Upon scanning toward the cathodic region of potentials, an irreversible electrochemical system is seen on the CV curve (Fig. 6) at E pc = −0.63 V versus SCE (−0.38 V versus NHE). A shoulder is also observed at the positive foot (−0.54 V) (−0.29 versusNHE) of this main system. Irreversibility of the cathodic process undergone by the FeIII complex suggests that the corresponding FeII complex is not stable, i.e. a strong change in the coordination sphere around the iron cation occurs during electron transfer and/or the FeII cation is released in solution as an aqueous hydroxo-complex under our experimental conditions (pH 7.2). In addition, the low reduction potential of the FeIII complex shows for the first time that the FeIII redox state is highly stabilized upon complexation with calcein. Compared with the free FeII/FeIIIsystem in acidic solution (E f = 0.52 Vversus SCE) (0.77 V versus NHE), FeIII is stabilized by ∼1.15 V. If the overall stability constant for FeIICAH (assuming a protonated complex as for FeIII) log β111(FeII) is evaluated according to the following formula, E c° =E f° + 0.059log[β111(FeIICAH)/β111(FeIIICAH)], its value is 14.4, that means that when the reduction of the complex occurs, the FeII complex is clearly partially dissociated. An equimolar aqueous solution (2.5·10−7m) of CA and Fe(III) is made. Similarly, FeII + CA mixture is prepared in a glove box. The fluorescence emission spectrum of CA is compared with that of Fe(III) and Fe(II)CA complexes (Fig. 7). Quenching was 85% with Fe(III) and only 20% with Fe(II). At the same time, the UV-visible spectrum of a CA + FeII solution at 10−4m was recorded and found to be very similar to that of CA alone (not shown). Citrate is known to be very abundant in vivo (1–8 mm citrate compared with 2–100 μm iron in root sap (24Brown J.C. Chaney R.L. Plant Physiol. 1971; 47: 836-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and serves as the main intercellular iron transporter in plants. The affinity of citrate for iron(III) is characterized by a log β110(LFeIII) value of 11.8. Thus, this value seems low as compared with that of calcein which is measured here, log β111(LFeIII) = 33.9; one would expect calcein to take up iron from citrate. Ideally, a fluorescent chemosensor should not withdraw too much iron from iron transport molecules, which are the precursor of most biological iron ligands. NTA (log β110(LFeIII) = 15.9) has an intermediate affinity, maybe close to that of many cellular iron ligands. Experiments are necessary to test if citrate has the potential to share iron with calcein (and NTA) in an inversible equilibrium, which evolves quickly enough to reflect metabolic competition for iron. A stopped flow experiment of iron(III) complexation by calcein and calcein blue has shown that the reaction is completed in 1 s (Fig. 8). CA fluorescence is therefore expected to be a fast reporting tool of the iron(III) availability. Kinetics of iron exchange between calcein and NTA or citrate have been followed by measuring the variations of the fluorescence intensity of the solution during incubation with a large excess of NTA or citrate (10 or 6320 molar eq, respectively) in a buffer 40 mm Hepes at pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, at 25 °C in the presence of 4·10−7 FeIIICAH. These conditions were chosen because citrate is much more abundant in vivo as compared with CA, when introduced as a probe. Fig. 9 shows that fluorescence intensity at 511 nm increases, indicating iron release from calcein. The kinetics of iron release from FeIIICAH to NTA or to citrate is easily measurable in the time scale of minutes. Calcein is shown able to reflect both iron loading or release by citrate, in the range of concentrations expected to be found in vivo. We conclude that despite its high affinity, calcein at low concentrations seems able to reflect changes in pFeIII induced by ligands like citrate and NTA, which cover a wide range of affinity for iron, presumably that of metabo"
https://openalex.org/W2161895615,"A cadmium-hypersensitive mutant of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was found to accumulate abnormally high levels of sulfide. The gene required for normal regulation of sulfide levels, hmt2 +, was cloned by complementation of the cadmium-hypersensitive phenotype of the mutant. Cell fractionation and immunocytochemistry indicated that HMT2 protein is localized to mitochondria. Sequence analysis revealed homology between HMT2 and sulfide dehydrogenases from photosynthetic bacteria. HMT2 protein, produced in and purified from Escherichia coli, was soluble, bound FAD, and catalyzed the reduction of quinone (coenzyme Q2) by sulfide. HMT2 activity was also detected in isolated fission yeast mitochondria. We propose that HMT2 functions as a sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. Homologous enzymes may be widespread in higher organisms, as sulfide-oxidizing activities have been described previously in animal mitochondria, and genes of unknown function, but with similarity to hmt2 +, are present in the genomes of flies, worms, rats, mice, and humans."

Chicken zyxin and its human counterpart display less than 60% sequence identity, raising concern about their functional identity. Here, we demonstrate that human zyxin, like the avian protein, specifically interacts with α-actinin. Furthermore, we map the interaction site to a motif of approximately 22 amino acids, present in the N-terminal domain of human zyxin. This motif is both necessary and sufficient for α-actinin binding, whereas a downstream region, which is related in sequence, appears to be dispensable. A synthetic peptide comprising human zyxin residues 21–42 specifically binds to α-actinin in solid phase binding assays. In contrast to full-length zyxin, constructs lacking this motif do not interact with α-actinin in blot overlays and fail to recruit α-actinin in living cells. When zyxin lacking the α-actinin binding site is expressed as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein, association of the recombinant protein with stress fibers is abolished, and targeting to focal adhesions is grossly impaired.

Our results suggest a crucial role for the α-actinin-zyxin interaction in subcellular zyxin localization and microfilament organization. A panoply of cellular processes, such as cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, motility, morphogenesis, growth and differentiation, are largely dependent on the structure and dynamics of the actin-based cytoskeleton and its associated signaling proteins. Elucidation of the mutual interactions between the wide variety of known microfilament-associated proteins has shed light on the underlying organization of the multi-level protein network and also on its linkages e.g. to transmembrane receptors (for a review see Ref. 1Yamada K.M. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Due to their involvement in a variety of biological systems, special interest has been devoted to zyxin and the F-actin-binding protein α-actinin, two interacting constituents of these supramolecular protein complexes. α-Actinin is a major constituent of diverse actin-based structures, such as stress fibers, focal adhesions, and the peripheral belt of epithelial cells (2Schulze H. Huckriede A. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. Jockusch B.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 3Pavalko F.M. Schneider G. Burridge K. Lim S.-S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). α-Actinin is also found in the cortical actin filament webs at the periphery of highly dynamic lamellae (2Schulze H. Huckriede A. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. Jockusch B.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The protein forms a rod-shaped antiparallel dimer of approximately 100-kDa subunits, each subunit comprising an N-terminal actin binding domain, four central spectrin-like repeats, and two C-terminal EF-hand motifs (4Puius Y.A. Mahoney N.M. Almo S.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Whereas the spectrin-like repeats are thought to be involved in dimerization, the C-terminal domain confers Ca2+ sensitivity on actin binding of different nonmuscle isoforms (5Critchley D.R. Flood G. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, San Francisco1999Google Scholar).

Due to the substantial overlap in subcellular distribution and the emerging functions of zyxin in actin filament regulation, the α-actinin-zyxin interaction has gained special interest. Zyxin was originally identified in chicken fibroblasts as a protein associated with focal adhesions, stress fibers, and cell-cell adherens junctions (19Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5847-5853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A human cDNA coding for a protein closely resembling chicken zyxin but with less than 60% sequence identity has been isolated in a subtractive cDNA cloning approach by virtue of its reduced expression in SV40 transformed fibroblasts (20Zumbrunn J.

ActA seems to accomplish this function by enhancing the Arp2/3 complex driven nucleation of new actin filaments (30Zigmond S.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R654-R657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of zyxin appears to share some structural and functional similarity with the central and the C-terminal portion of the ActA protein (23Reinhard M. Jouvenal K. Tripier D.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, both zyxin and ActA harbor proline-rich binding sites for their common ligands VASP (23Reinhard M. Jouvenal K. Tripier D. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7956-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar,25Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F. Wehland J.

The interactions with VASP and Mena are thought to contribute to efficient actin polymerization by recruiting polymerization competent profilactin complexes (24Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Hence, zyxin may likewise regulate actin filament organization and thus represent an endogenous ActA analogue in eukaryotic cells (23Reinhard M. Jouvenal K. Tripier D. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7956-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 25Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F. Wehland J. Chakraborty T.

By in vitro binding assays, chicken zyxin has been shown to interact with α-actinin (18Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J.

Beckerle M.C. Ullrich A. Jallal B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1577-1581PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitrointeraction between zyxin and α-actinin is of moderate affinity and involves the N-terminal part of α-actinin (18Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which includes the actin binding domain (4Puius Y.A. Mahoney N.M. Almo S.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and also binds to PIP2 (5Critchley D.R. Flood G. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, San Francisco1999Google Scholar) and chicken CRP1 (32Pomiès P. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Vice versa, the α-actinin binding site has only roughly been mapped to the N-terminal region of chicken zyxin (amino acids 1–348; Ref. 15Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). A similar interaction with α-actinin has not yet been established for human zyxin, and also, functional in vivo evidence for a direct α-actinin-zyxin linkage is missing. Therefore, we set out to investigate a putative interaction between human zyxin and α-actinin in more detail. In this study, we demonstrate that the human protein binds to α-actinin as described for the avian protein. We further localize the interaction site to a motif of about 22 amino acids, present in the zyxin N terminus. Using a synthetic peptide and various deletion constructs, we finally show that this motif, but not a related downstream region, is both necessary and sufficient for zyxin interaction with α-actinin in vitro.Furthermore, this α-actinin binding site is essential for zyxin-dependent α-actinin recruitment in living cells as well as for proper subcellular zyxin localization. Twelve cDNA clones for human zyxin had previously been isolated from a placenta cDNA library (20Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The inserts of seven clones with successively truncated 5′-ends (B91, B52, B4, 925, 835, 725, and 225) were selected and subcloned into the EcoRI restriction site of the expression vector pGEX-5X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) downstream of the GST gene. Orientation and reading frame of the final constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Shorter fusion polypeptides were prepared by expression of different restriction fragments in E. coli (BL21). These fragments were prepared from the 5′-end of the full-length zyxin cDNA by partial or complete digestion with the enzymes EcoRI, SmaI,NcoI, MspI, and HaeIII and subsequently ligated in the desired reading frame into the expression vector pGEX-5X. An FspI fragment comprising bases 55–1318 of the human zyxin cDNA (20Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was inserted into the SmaI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pSPL61 (33Pistor S. Chakraborty T. Niebuhr K. Domann E. Wehland J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 34Bubeck P. Pistor S. Wehland J. Jockusch B.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1361-1371PubMed Google Scholar). TheMscI-BamHI fragment of this construct was replaced by sequential ligation with the zyxinMscI-MaeII fragment and anMaeII-BamHI adapter consisting of the complementary oligonucleotides A1 and A2, resulting in the wild type zyxin mitochondrial targeting construct (targZyxinWT). Two PCR products were amplified with the wild type mitochondrial targeting construct as a template and the primer pairs U4589/S1L and S1U/L1708, introducing a unique SacII restriction site into each PCR product. Both products were digested with SacII and ligated. The ligation product was then used as a template for PCR amplification with the primer pair U159/L1423. The resulting PCR product was gel purified and cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and a 267-base pairNcoI-BglII fragment of the corresponding clone was ligated into either NcoI-BglII digested targZyxinWT or wild type GST-zyxin vector. Two PCR products amplified from wild type GST-zyxin vector with the primer pairs S1U/S2L and S2U/L1868, respectively, were ligated after NgoMI digestion. With the ligation product as a template and the primers S1U and L1868, a PCR product was amplified, gel purified, and ligated into pCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector (Stratagene). A 589-base pair fragment, which comprises the deletion site corresponding to zyxin amino acids 261–283, was excised with BglII-DraIII and inserted into the BglII-DraIII sites of wild type GST-zyxin, GST-zyxin Δ19–41, targZyxinWT, and targZyxin Δ19–41, yielding the corresponding constructs GST-zyxin Δ261–283, GST-zyxin Δ19–41/Δ261–283, targZyxin Δ261–283, and targZyxin Δ19–41/Δ261–283, respectively. Two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides, OU and OL, were annealed, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and inserted into the SacII-digested and dephosphorylated targZyxin Δ19–41 construct. To reduce the background of parental plasmids, the ligated product was digested with SacII prior to transformation into competent DH5α cells. All junctions of different sequence inserts as well as all PCR-amplified regions were verified by DNA sequencing. The oligonucleotides used were as follows: A1, 5′-CGTGCTCTGTCGGAAGTGCCACACTGCTAGAGCCCAGACG-3′; A2, 5′-GATCCGTCTGGGCTCTAGCAGTGTGGCACTTCCGACAGAGCA-3′; L1423, 5′-ACTTAGGCGCTGGAGCCGGAGATGAG-3′; L1708, 5′-GCTCCTCCACCTCCTTCAGA-3′; L1868, 5′-GCAGGTGAAGCAGGCGATGTG-3′; OU, 5′-CCCTAAGTTTTCTCCAGTGACTCCTAAGTTTACTCCTGTGGCTTCCAAGTTCAGTCCTGGAGC-3′; OL, 5′-TCCAGGACTGAACTTGGAAGCCACAGGAGTAAACTTAGGAGTCACTGGAGAAAACTTAGGGGC-3′; S1L, 5′-TGCACCCCGCGGGAGCCGAGACCGAAACGGAG-3′; S1U, 5′-CGGCTCCCGCGGGTGACAGCGAGCCTCCCCCGGCAC-3′; S2L, 5′-GAAATCTTGCGGCCGCACGCCGGCGATGAGGCTGGGGGCCCTCGG-3′; S2U, 5′-GTTCAGTCCGCCGGCGCCAGGTGGATCTGGGTCACAA-3′; U159, 5′-GAATGAAAGACCCCACCTGTA-3′; U4589, 5′-CGACACGGAAATGTTGAATAC-3′. The full-length cDNA sequence of human zyxin and three deletion constructs (see above) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI site of the expression vector pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) downstream of the reporter gene for GFP. The final constructs harbored the zyxin sequence for amino acid residues 1–570 (wild type) or the same sequence with deletions corresponding to amino acid residues 19–41 (GFP-zyxin Δ19–41), 261–283 (GFP-zyxin Δ261–283) or 19–41 and 261–283 (GFP-zyxin Δ19–41/Δ261–283). The reading frame and the authenticity of the final constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. pEGFP-C3 plasmids (1 μg/well) were mixed with 100 μl of Opti-MEM 1 (Life Technologies) containing 3 μl of FuGENE-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and were added to COS-1 cells (ATCC CRL-1650), which had grown to 60% confluence in 6 well plates. Chicken tendon fibroblasts (36Koller E. Hayman A.R. Trueb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were transfected in a similar way using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). One to 2 days after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and inspected at an excitation wave length of 450–490 nm. PtK2 cells were grown on coverslips in minimum essential medium with Eagle's salts, Glutamax ITM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with the mitochondrial targeting constructs by the calcium phosphate method, using an overnight incubation with 5 μg of DNA per 3-cm dish. Two days posttransfection, cells were prepared for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence microscopy of formaldehyde fixed cells was done essentially as described (37Reinhard M. Halbrügge M. Scheer U. Wiegand C. Jockusch B.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: rabbit-anti zyxin serum AS83–1 (23Reinhard M. Jouvenal K. Tripier D. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7956-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), mouse anti-α-actinin monoclonal antibody BM 75.2 (Sigma), Oregon Green-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), and Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM antibodies (Jackson ImmunoReasearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Prior to use the latter antibodies were preadsorbed to rabbit γ globulins (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) immobilized on a Sepharose cartridge. Proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting. The blots were incubated with various antibodies or processed for blot overlays. Goat anti-GST antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The preparation of the anti-human zyxin monoclonal antibody 164ID4 will be described elsewhere. 2Krause et al., manuscript in preparation. A polyclonal antiserum against a synthetic peptide corresponding to human zyxin residues 134–147 was raised in rabbits. Bound antibodies were detected with 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma) followed by development with bromochloroindolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium substrate. For radiolabeling, α-actinin (Sigma A9776) was dialyzed exhaustively against 500 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, and transferred to a test tube, which had been coated with Iodogen according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). Carrier-free Na125I (0.5 mCi/200 μg of protein; final volume, 500 μl) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min on ice, followed by 5 min at room temperature. Radiolabeled protein was separated from nonincorporated iodine by chromatography on Sephadex G-50. Blot overlays were performed essentially as described (18Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Residual protein-binding sites on the nitrocellulose blots were blocked overnight with 0.75% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The blots were incubated at room temperature on a rocking platform with the radiolabeled probe (5 × 105 cpm/ml). After 4 h, the blots were washed twice with the same buffer and exposed to BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For conjugation with peroxidase α-actinin was purified from chicken gizzard essentially as described (38Feramisco J.R. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1194-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that phosphocellulose P11 was substituted by fibrous phosphocellulose (Sigma, C-3145), and α-actinin was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in equilibration buffer. The protein was >95% pure as judged from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and Coomassie Blue staining. 300 μg of purified α-actinin was coupled to 1 mg of preactivated horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The peptides were purified on a VYDAC RP C-8 column to >85% purity and were verified by mass spectral analysis (Genosys Biotechnologies, Pampisford, United Kingdom). Maleimide activated microtiter plates (Reacti-BindTM, Pierce) and amine binding microtiter plates with anN-oxysuccinimide surface (DNA-BINDTM, Costar) were coated with 50 or 100 μg/ml peptide solution, respectively. After washing and blocking of remaining binding sites 0.5–50 μg/ml peroxidase-labeled α-actinin (protein concentration refers to α-actinin) was added (triplicates). Bound α-actinin-peroxidase conjugate was detected by incubation with o-phenylenediamine peroxidase substrate solution (Sigma). The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 volume of 750 mm HCl. For analysis, background values obtained without peptide coating were subtracted. Blot Overlays of N-terminal Zyxin Deletion Mutants Reveal a Functional α-Actinin Binding Site—A potential interaction of α-actinin with human zyxin was investigated in a blot overlay assay.

We used systemic gene delivery to identify anti-angiogenic gene products effective against metastatic spread in tumor-bearing mice. Specifically, CLDC-based intravenous delivery of the p53 and GM-CSF genes were each as effective as the potent antiangiogenic gene, angiostatin, in reducing both tumor metastasis and tumor angiogenesis. Combined delivery of these genes did not increase anti-tumor activity, further suggesting that each gene appeared to produce its antimetastatic activity through a common antiangiogenic pathway. CLDC-based intravenous delivery of the human wild type p53 gene transfected up to 80% of tumor cells metastatic to lung. Furthermore, it specifically induced the expression of the potent antiangiogenic gene, thrombospondin-1, indicating that p53 gene delivery in vivo may inhibit angiogenesis by inducing endogenous thrombospondin-1 expression. CLDC-based delivery also identified a novel anti-tumor activity for the metastasis suppressor gene CC3. Thus, CLDC-based intravenous gene delivery can produce systemic antiangiogenic gene therapy using a variety of different genes and may be used to assess potential synergy of combined anti-tumor gene delivery and to identify novel activities for existing anti-tumor genes.

Molecular genetics has identified a large number of genes whose aberrant or loss of expression is correlated with the initiation and/or progression of the malignant phenotype (1Levine A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 623-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 2Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 138-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). However, it has been difficult to determine whether the overexpression of the normal gene products can produce significant anti-tumor effects in tumor-bearing animals for several reasons. First, it may be difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of secreted gene products to test their potential anti-cancer activity in tumor-bearing animals (3O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C.

Med. 1996; 2: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Second, testing gene products that function only within cells, such as tumor-suppressing DNA-binding nucleoproteins, often requires the use ofin vivo gene delivery, since administration of recombinant proteins would not be expected to deliver therapeutic levels of the active molecules to their required tissue and cellular sites of action in tumor-bearing hosts. Similar cellular barriers have limited thein vivo delivery of therapeutic levels of antisense and ribozyme constructs directed against the products of overexpressed transforming genes (5Heidenreich O. Kang S.H. Xu X. Nerenberg M. Mol. Med. Today. 1995; 3: 128-133Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Kijima H. Ishida H. Ohkawa T. Kashani-Sabet M. Scanlon K.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 68: 247-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Existing in vivo gene delivery systems have been particularly limited in their ability to treat metastatic cancer, which is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in human cancer patients (7Liotta L.A.

We now show that these redesigned CLDC are able to transfect large numbers of metastatic tumor cells with the wild type human p53 gene following intravenous injection into C57Bl6 mice bearing metastatic B16-F10 melanoma tumors. Furthermore, CLDC-based, intravenous delivery of a variety of different anti-tumor genes each produced significant anti-metastatic activity and concurrently reduced tumor angiogenesis. This approach also permitted the assessment of potential in vivo anti-tumor synergy between combinations of anti-tumor genes, thus helping to determine whether genes are producing their anti-tumor effects by common or independent pathways. It also identified a novel anti-tumor activity for the CC3 metastasis suppressor gene in tumor-bearing hosts. CMV-p53 was constructed by isolating a 1.4-kilobase pair HindIII–SmaI fragment containing the wild type human p53 cDNA (a gift from Dr. B.

DOTIM:cholesterol multilamellar vesicles (MLV) and pure DOTIM MLV were prepared as described previously (8Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat.

Murine B16-F10 melanoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The B16-F10 melanoma cells expressed the wild type p53 gene, as determined by both DNA damage and Western blot analyses (data not shown), and also expressed low levels of the CC3 protein, as determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown). For tumor cell inoculation, B16-F10 cells were trypsinized, and then 25,000 cells/mouse in 200 μl of culture medium were injected by tail vein into 25-g female C57Bl6 mice (Simonson, Gilroy, CA). B16-F10 melanoma is a highly metastatic subclone of B16 melanoma (13Fidler I.J. Nicolson G.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1976; 57: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) that kills mice approximately 35 days following intravenous inoculation of 25,000 cells (data not shown). Unless specifically indicated, each mouse received 25 μg of plasmid DNA complexed to DOTIM:cholesterol MLV. The DNA:lipid ratio (μg of DNA/nmol of total lipid) was 1:16 for all DOTIM:cholesterol MLV and 1:26 for pure DOTMA MLV. Each of these DNA:lipid ratios had previously been determined to produce maximal levels of gene expression following intravenous injection of CLDC (Ref. 8Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar and data not shown). CLDC were injected into tumor-bearing mice either 3 or 10 days after tumor cell inoculation or, in some cases, once only at day 7 following tumor inoculation. For the immunohistochemistry studies, mice were injected intravenously with CLDC 29 days after tumor cell inoculation. All mice were sacrificed 30 days after tumor cell inoculation, and lungs from each mouse were dissected out, infused transtracheally with 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher), and then fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The number and size of the black-appearing tumor nodules were counted two times under a dissecting microscope by an individual blinded to the identity of the groups. Only tumor nodules >2 mm in diameter were included in the analysis, since tumor growth beyond 2–3 mm appears to depend on the presence of tumor angiogenesis (14Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar, 15.Rak, J., Filmus, J., Finkenzeller, G., Grugel, S., Marme, D., and Kerbel, R. S. (1995) 14, 263–277.Google Scholar, 16Bouck N.

The potential statistical significance of differences between the various groups was assessed using an unpaired, two-sided Student'st test. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 4-μm sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated to phosphate-buffered saline. Pretreatments included microwave antigen retrieval in a 10 mm citrate buffer for 10 min (factor VIII, p53), 10% sucrose at 80 °C for 2 h (thrombospondin), or 0.01% trypsin with 0.25% protease for 10 min (Sigma; factor VIII). Endogenous antibodies were blocked with CAS Block (Zymed Laboratories Inc., S. San Francisco, CA; p53, thrombospondin) or normal goat serum (1:10 dilution; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA; factor VIII). Overnight incubation at room temperature was performed using polyclonal anti-p53 antibody (1:100 dilution, BioGenex Labs, San Ramon, CA) or anti-thrombospondin (1:35 dilution; Biodesign International, Westbrook, ME). Incubation using polyclonal anti-factor VIII (von Willebrand's factor, 1:250 dilution; Dako Corp., Carpenteria, CA) was carried out at room temperature for 1 h. All primary antibodies were washed off with 0.2–1% Tween 20 (Fisher), and biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit (1:500; Vector Laboratories; Factor VIII, p53) or biotinylated rabbit-anti rat (1:200; Vector Laboratories; thrombospondin) linker was applied for 30 min. Following additional washes, ABC elite (factor VIII, p53, Vector Laboratories) or streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:100; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was applied for 30 min. After additional washes, AEC (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) was used for 20 min followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin and coverslipping with crystal mount (Biomeda Corp.). The intratumoral blood vessels were quantitated using factor VIII, anti-von Willebrand's factor staining, as described above. For each tumor, high power magnification was used with an intraocular grid. The grid facilitated counting so that no vessel was scored twice. Vessels that were visibly interconnected were scored only once. Neovessels within each tumor >2 mm were counted in as many high powered fields (grids) as could be placed within each tumor (usually two or three, as high as five) based upon the size of the nodule. This differs from vessel counting in larger human tumors (18Craft P.S. Harris A.L. Adv. Oncol. 1994; 5: 305-311Scopus (120) Google Scholar), because areas of high vascularity were not preselected. Rather, the entire cross section of these tumor nodules was analyzed. The final angiogenesis score for each nodule reflected a summation of all scores (the sum of scores, divided by the total number of fields that were counted). Every tumor nodule of >2 mm that was microscopically visualized from each animal was analyzed for neoangiogenesis. A total of nine tumors from five different mice treated with the CAT gene, nine tumors from four different mice treated with the angiostatin gene, 12 tumors from six different mice treated with the p53 gene, and four tumors from three different mice treated with the GM-CSF gene were analyzed. Thus, 34 individual tumors from 18 individual mice, all derived from experiment 1a were individually counted. To quantitate p53 gene expression, only cells showing the characteristic pattern of nuclear staining were counted as positive, and for TSP-1, only cells showing cytoplasmic reactivity were counted. Scores for p53 and TSP-1 gene expression reflect the percentage of positive cells for each histologically identifiable tumor nodule evaluated. All evaluable tumors on the tissue sections used for the assay were quantitated. We first compared the size and number of lung metastases in the CLDC-treated and control C57Bl6 mice 30 days after intravenous injection of 25,000 B16-F10 melanoma cells/mouse. Individual mice in groups of eight received 400 nmol of DOTIM:cholesterol MLV complexed to 25 μg of an HCMV-driven expression plasmid containing the murine angiostatin gene, the murine GM-CSF gene, the human wild type p53 gene, or the CAT reporter gene (mock-treated controls) on day 3 and again on day 10 following tumor inoculation. The control group received B16-F10 cells but no further treatment. CLDC-mediated, intravenous delivery of the murine angiostatin gene, murine GM-CSF, or the wild type human p53 gene each produced significant anti-metastatic effects, as determined by both the total number of lung metastases (data not shown) and those greater than 2 mm in diameter in tumor-bearing mice, when compared with either reporter gene-treated (p < 0.05) or untreated (p < 0.05) controls by a two-sided Student'st test (Fig. 1A). The p53-treated, angiostatin-treated, and GM-CSF gene-treated groups each produced similar reductions in the number of lung metastases compared with control groups. Reporter gene (mock)-treated and untreated controls did not differ significantly in either the total number of tumors or the number of tumors greater than 2 mm in diameter (p < 0.375). Previously, intravenous injection of DOTMA:DOPE small unilamellar vesicles complexed to 10 μg of control (noncoding) DNA produced some degree of nonspecific anti-tumor activity in SCID mice bearing a human breast cancer xenograft when compared with nontreated controls (19Lesoon-Wood L.A. Kim W.H. Kleinman H.K. Weintraub B.D. Mixson A.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of nonspecific CLDC-mediated anti-tumor activity between the two studies may be due to differences in the tumor lines and/or mouse strains used, the size and composition of the cationic liposomes used, the dose and schedule of CLDC administration, and/or the time of sacrifice. We next tested whether co-injection of the p53 and GM-CSF genes, the p53 and angiostatin genes, or the angiostatin and GM-CSF genes into individual groups of mice produced synergistic anti-tumor activity when compared with injection of the individual genes themselves. CLDC-based intravenous injection of each gene individually, as well as each of the gene combinations, reduced both the total number of lung tumors and the numbers of tumors greater than 2 mm by comparable levels when compared with the control mice (Fig. 1B). Thus, no combination of genes enhanced the level of anti-tumor activity produced by each gene individually, indicating a lack of synergistic anti-tumor activity. As observed previously in Fig. 1A, the angiostatin, p53, and GM-CSF genes individually each produced similar levels of anti-tumor activity. CLDC-based, intravenous injection of 12.5 μg of CMV-angiostatin plus 12.5 μg of CMV-luciferase produced antimetastatic effects that did not differ significantly from those produced by 25 μg of CMV-angiostatin alone (data not shown). Thus, the failure of angiostatin combined with either GM-CSF or p53 to produce synergistic anti-tumor effects does not appear to be due to the reduced dose of the individual anti-tumor genes injected. We then compared the size and number of lung metastases produced in groups of mice injected with CLDC containing the murine angiostatin gene, the human CC3 gene, the human BCL-2 gene, or the luciferase gene (mock-treated controls) on days 3 and 10 after tumor inoculation or no treatment (control group). Additional groups of tumor-bearing mice received a single intravenous injection of CLDC containing either the murine angiostatin gene or the luciferase gene 7 days after receiving B16-F10 melanoma cells in order to determine the effect of delaying CLDC therapy on the level of anti-tumor activity achieved. We also tested the CC3 gene (an apopotosis-inducing metastasis suppressor gene (20Shtivelman E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)) and the BCL-2 gene (a potent antagonist of apopotosis). Overexpression of BCL-2 has been linked to the development of human tumors (21Tsuimoto Y. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 83: 5214-5218Crossref Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). CLDC-mediated, intravenous delivery of the murine angiostatin gene and the human CC3 gene at days 3 and 10 each produced significant anti-metastatic effects, when compared with BCL-2 gene-treated mice (p < 0.05), to luciferase gene (mock)-treated (p < 0.05) or to untreated (p < 0.05) controls (Fig. 1C). A single intravenous injection at day 7 of CLDC containing the murine angiostatin gene also significantly reduced tumor metastases when compared with control groups (p < 0.05) but was somewhat less effective than two injections of the angiostatin gene initiated at a time when the tumor burden was less extensive. Furthermore, although the B16-F10 line has been cloned as a predominately lung metastatic tumor line (13Fidler I.J. Nicolson G.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1976; 57: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we noted the presence of significant numbers of extrapulmonary B16-F10 metastases in this as well as in prior experiments. Therefore, we counted the number of extrapulmonary metastases present in this experiment. The overall number of extrapulmonary metastases was significantly reduced in the angiostatin-treated (a total of one metastasis) and CC3-treated groups (no metastases) compared with control groups (a total of 8 ± 2.7 metastases) (p < 0.01 for angiostatin and p < 0.005 for CC3). Metastases were present in the liver, gastrointestinal tract, spinal cord, thymus, skin, and lymph nodes. Thus, CLDC-based intravenous gene delivery of active anti-angiogenic and tumor suppressor genes can reduce metastatic spread to a variety of target organs to which solid tumors commonly metastasize (7Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. DeVita V. Hellman S. Rosenberg S. Principles of the Molecular Biology of Cancer: Cancer Metastasis in Cancer, Principles and Practice of Oncology. Lippincott, Philadelphia1993: 134-150Google Scholar). To more specifically address the relationship between the level of antiangiogenic expression achieved and of the extent of the anti-tumor activity produced, we tested whether increasing the level of angiostatin gene expression through the use of a more efficient cationic formulation could significantly increase anti-tumor efficacy against B16-F10 metastases. Specifically, we compared the anti-tumor activity against B16-F10 produced by the angiostatin gene delivered by two different cationic liposome formulations: 1) DOTIM:cholesterol liposomes (used in experiments 1A through 1C) or 2) pure DOTMA liposomes have been shown to produce approximately 10-fold higher levels of gene expression than DOTIM:cholesterol liposomes (Ref. 22Song Y.K. Liu F. Chu S. Liu D. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar and data not shown). We found that intravenous injection of 25 μg of the angiostatin gene complexed to DOTIM:cholesterol liposomes reduced metastases >2 mm by 65%versus control mice, whereas the angiostatin gene complexed to pure DOTMA liposomes reduced metastases by 88% versuscontrol mice (p < 0.025 versusDOTIM:cholesterol liposomes) (Fig. 1D). Thus, the degree of anti-tumor activity achieved appears to depend on the efficiency of gene transfer and expression produced. Increasing the level of angiostatin gene expression further reduced the number of lung metastases to quite low levels. We then attempted to identify a mechanism for the comparable levels of anti-tumor activity produced by the p53, angiostatin, and GM-CSF genes. We determined the mean number of intratumoral blood vessels in p53-, GM-CSF-, angiostatin-, and CAT-treated mice using neoangiogenesis counts facilitated by immunoreactivity to Factor VIII-anti-von Willebrand factor antibody (23Weidner N. Semple J.P. Welch W.R. Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (5361) Google Scholar). CLDC-based delivery of the p53, GM-CSF, and angiostatin genes each significantly reduced tumor neovascularity when compared with control mice (p < 0.0005) (Table I). Delivery of the p53, GM-CSF, and angiostatin genes each reduced tumor angiogenesis to a very similar extent, indicating that each gene product induced antiangiogenic activity within tumors in tumor-bearing mice (Table I). Intravenous injection of CLDC containing the p53, angiostatin, or GM-CSF genes reduced tumor angiogenesis by levels comparable with the reduction in tumor angiogenesis produced by the implantation of a murine T241 fibrosarcoma cell line stably transfected with the murine angiostatin gene (24Cao Y. O'Reilly M.S. Marshall B. Flynn E. Ji R.W. Folkman J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).Table IIntravenous, CLDC-based injection of the angiostatin, p53, or GM-CSF genes each significantly reduces tumor vascularityCLDC injectedTotal blood vessels/tumorCLDC-angiostatin gene8.0 ± 2.2ap < 0.0005 versus control.CLDC-p53 gene7.9 ± 2.3ap < 0.0005 versus control.CLDC-GM-CSF gene8.5 ± 3.4bp < 0.01 versus control.CLDC-CAT (control)14.2 ± 3.1Means ± S.D. values are shown.

To assess to what extent the CLDC we used could transfect tumor cells in mice bearing advanced metastatic disease, we assessed p53 immunoreactivity in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice previously injected with CLDC containing either the wild type p53 gene or the CAT gene. These mice were injected with B16-F10 cells on day 0 and subsequently with CLDC on day 29, a time when lung metastases were at an advanced stage. Essentially all tumors examined in the lungs of p53-treated mice showed p53 expression within the nucleus of transfected cells (Fig. 2A). Although the staining for p53 immunoreactivity varied in intensity (Fig. 2A), large numbers of tumor cells examined showed some degree of positive staining for p53. Immunopositivity of wild type p53 suggested a high level of p53 gene expression, since the wild type p53 generally does not stain positively in this assay because of rapid degradation of the encoded protein (25Thor A.D. Moore II, D.H. Edgerton S.M Kawasaki E.S. Reihsaus E. Lynch H.T. Marcus J.N. Schwartz L. Chen L.C. Mayall B.H. Smith H.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Positivity was also noted in some macrophage and endothelial cell nuclei (Fig. 2A). p53 expression was not seen in either tumor cells or in normal cells in the lungs of either CAT-treated (Fig. 2B) or untreated mice (data not shown). Since delivery of the p53 gene significantly reduced tumor vascularity (Table I) and since p53 gene expression has been shown to induce expression of the potent antiangiogenic factor, TSP-1, in cultured fibroblasts (24Cao Y. O'Reilly M.S. Marshall B. Flynn E. Ji R.W. Folkman J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and epithelial cells (25Thor A.D. Moore II, D.H. Edgerton S.M Kawasaki E.S. Reihsaus E. Lynch H.T. Marcus J.N. Schwartz L. Chen L.C. Mayall B.H. Smith H.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), we determined whether systemic delivery of the p53 gene altered TSP-1 expression in the lung, using immunohistochemistry. p53-treated mice showed TSP-1 expression within the cytoplasm of the large majority of tumor cells present within the lung as well as in rare normal pulmonary cell types (Fig. 2C). TSP-1 expression was not detected in the lungs of either CAT-treated (Fig. 2D) or in untreated mice (data not shown). Thus, p53 gene delivery could specifically induce widespread TSP-1 expression in metastatic tumors in vivo. TSP-1 may mediate both the antiangiogenic (Table I) and antimetastatic (Fig. 1,A and B) activity of p53 in B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice. To directly assess the dose-response relationship between p53 gene transduction and the induction of TSP-1 gene expression, we quantitated the percentage of tumor cells expressing p53 and also TSP-1, following intravenous injection of DOTIM:cholesterol liposomes complexed to either 40 or 50 μg of the p53 gene. Increasing the DNA dose from 40 to 50 μg/mouse reproducibly increases the level of expression of delivered genes between 5- and 10-fold following intravenous injection of CLDC containing DOTIM:cholesterol liposomes (data not shown). Injecting CLDC containing 40 μg of the p53 gene transfected 29.6 ± 3.7% of B16-F10 tumor cells metastatic to the lung with p53 and induced TSP-1 expression in 39.2% ± 3.4% of these cells, whereas injecting CLDC containing 50 μg of the p53 gene transduced 82.1% ± 2.7 of lung tumor cells with p53 and induced TSP-1 expression in 98.6% ± 0.6% of these cells (Table II). (No positive staining for p53 or TSP-1 gene expression was detected in either B16-F10 or normal cells from the lungs of mice injected with CLDC containing 50 μg of the CAT gene (Fig. 2, B and D). The levels of p53 and TSP-1 expression were increased by 2.8- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in the 50 μg-injected group and were each significantly higher than in the 40 μg-injected group (p < 0.0005). Therefore, the levels of both p53 transduction and TSP-1 induction varied directly with the dose of CLDC injected, and the 50-μg dose of the p53 gene appeared capable of transfecting the large majority of all B16-F10 tumor cells metastatic to lung.Table IIIncreasing p53 gene expression increases the induction of endogenous TSP-1 gene expression in metastatic tumorsCLDC-DNA dose injectedp53-positive cellsTSP-positive cells%40 μg of DNA29.6 ± 3.739.2 ± 3.450 μg of DNA82.1 ± 2.7ap < 0.0005 vs the respective 40 μg DNA-injected groups.98.6 ± 0.6ap < 0.0005 vs the respective 40 μg DNA-injected groups.-Fold increase vs. 40-μg dose2.82.5Means ± S.E. values are shown.

However, it has become evident that individual genes may produce anti-tumor effects by several different mechanisms. As examples, the wild type p53 gene has been shown to function as a potent tumor suppressor gene (28Chen P.-L. Chen Y. Bookstein R. Lee W.H. Science. 1990; 250: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 29Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). More recently, p53 has also been shown to exert antiangiogenic activity in tumor-bearing mice (30Xu M. Kumar D. Srinivas S. Detolla L.J. Yu S.F. Stass S.A. Mixson A.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), as well as to induce the production of the anti-angiogenic protein TSP-1 in cultured cells (26Dameron K.M. Volpert O.V. Tainsky M.A. Bouck N. Science. 1994; 265: 1582-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 27Volpert O.V. Stellmach V. Bouck N. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 36: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stable transfection of tumor cells with the cytokine gene GM-CSF has been shown to exert host-immune anti-tumor activity, mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes following tumor cell inoculation into mice (31Dranoff G. Jaffee E. Lazenby A. Golumbek P. Levitsky H. Brose K. Jackson V. Hamada H. Pardoll D. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3539-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2670) Google Scholar). More recently, recombinant GM-CSF has been shown to stimulate angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (32Bikfalvi A. Han Z.C. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 523-529PubMed Google Scholar, 33Soldi R. Primo L. Brizzi M.F. Sanavio F. Aglietta M. Polentarutti N. Pegoraro L. Mantovani A. Bussolino F. Blood. 1997; 89: 863-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, GM-CSF has also been shown to produce antiangiogenic activity via the induction of a specific macrophage metalloelastase, which cleaves plasminogen to generate angiostatin (34Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Since CLDC-based intravenous gene delivery targets gene expression to macrophages, as well as to vascular endothelial cells (8Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar,29Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar), the use of intravenous, CLDC-based GM-CSF gene delivery may shift the balance of GM-CSF's pro- and anti-angiogenic activities toward anti-angiogenesis when compared with the administration of recombinant GM-CSF protein. Our results show that CLDC-based intravenous delivery of the GM-CSF gene, the p53 gene, and the anti-angiogenic angiostatin gene each reduces both tumor angiogenesis and metastatic spread by comparable levels (Fig. 1, Aand B). Furthermore, CLDC-based delivery of combinations of these genes failed to significantly alter anti-tumor activity when compared with injection of each gene individually (Fig. 1B), suggesting that these genes are producing their anti-tumor effects via a common pathway. Therefore, our results are consistent with the interpretation that the products of the p53, GM-CSF, and angiostatin genes each produce anti-metastatic activity primarily as anti-angiogenic agents following intravenous, CLDC-based delivery. In support of this hypothesis, the level of reduction of tumor angiogenesis produced by CLDC-based intravenous injection of the murine angiostatin gene was similar to that produced by implantation of murine fibrosarcoma cells stably transfected with the murine angiostatin gene (Table I and Ref. 22Song Y.K. Liu F. Chu S. Liu D. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In addition, we have also shown that CLDC-based intravenous delivery of the wild type human p53 gene can specifically induce the production of TSP-1 in metastatic tumor cells in tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 2), indicating that p53-mediated antiangiogenesis in vivo may operate at least in part through the induction of TSP-1 expression (26Dameron K.M.

Our results now indicate that intravenously injected CLDC containing the p53 gene can transfect up to 80% of all lung tumor cells in mice bearing advanced metastatic disease (Table II). Thus, the use of CLDC may produce high levels of antiangiogenic gene products at their specific cellular sites of action. However, although CLDC-based delivery of the angiostatin gene reduced lung metastases by as much as 90% compared with control mice (Fig. 1D) and brought about significant reductions in tumor vascularity (Table I), it did not cause complete tumor regression, as previously reported following twice daily administration of high doses of recombinant angiostatin or implantation of tumor cells stably transfected with the angiostatin gene (3O'Reilly M.S.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Since high levels of angiostatin protein must be administered on a daily basis for prolonged periods in order to achieve complete tumor regression (3O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3180) Google Scholar, 4O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Chen C. Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), the degree of anti-tumor activity produced by only one or two doses of CLDC over the 35-day period of this study is encouraging. Our results also suggest that the overexpression of selected genes, which are aberrantly expressed only in a limited number of tumor types, may exert more generalized anti-tumor activity via CLDC-based, systemic gene delivery. For example, highly metastatic small cell lung carcinoma cells often lack CC3 expression. Stable transfection of these highly aggressive small cell lung cancer cells with the CC3 gene was shown to suppress their metastasis in mice (20Shtivelman E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We found that CLDC-based systemic delivery of the CC3 gene produced significant antimetastatic activity against B16-F10 melanoma, which expresses low levels of CC3 protein (Fig. 1C). This finding indicates that enforcing expression of higher levels of CC3 in metastatic cells that are not originally CC3-negative can produce significant antimetastatic effects. CLDC-based delivery of other such genes into tumor-bearing hosts may reveal novel tumor targets not identified by more traditional molecular genetic approaches. Furthermore, similar to existing chemotherapy of cancer, the combined anti-tumor activities of several different gene products, expressed simultaneously, may be required for therapeutic efficacy, particularly in patients with extensive tumor burdens. CLDC-based intravenous gene delivery may also be used to assess whether combinations of putative anti-cancer genes can produce synergistic anti-tumor activities in tumor-bearing hosts. Metastatic spread causes death in the overwhelming majority of patients dying from the most common forms of human cancer (7Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. DeVita V. Hellman S. Rosenberg S. Principles of the Molecular Biology of Cancer: Cancer Metastasis in Cancer, Principles and Practice of Oncology. Lippincott, Philadelphia1993: 134-150Google Scholar). Significant reductions in cancer mortality will thus require the development of new systemic therapies that can prevent and/or reverse the metastatic spread of cancer. The ability to transfer and express anti-tumor genes by intravenous administration offers a novel approach to the treatment of cancer. In addition, it may permit the identification of novel anti-cancer genes as well as reveal anti-cancer genes that act synergistically in tumor-bearing hosts. Ultimately, it may create the possibility of treating metastatic cancer by specifically correcting the molecular alterations responsible for producing the malignant phenotype. We thank S. Edgerton for excellent technical assistance, Dr. M. Kashani-Sabet for helpful suggestions, and Dr. D. Marieval for p53 analyses."

Despite the qualitatively similar signaling properties of the three α2AR subtypes, differences in trafficking of these receptors have been reported. For example, subtype-selective differences in agonist-elicited α2AR redistribution occur (10von Zastrow M. Daunt D.A. Barsh G. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

Leone S. Bylund D.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 254: 294-300PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, selective itineraries for the α2AR subtypes are observed in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) renal epithelial cells. Thus, the α2AAR subtype is targeted directly to the basolateral surface (16Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the α2BAR subtype is delivered randomly to both the apical and basolateral surfaces but is rapidly lost from the apical (t½ = 5–15 min) and selectively retained on the basolateral (t½ = 10–12 h) surface (17Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that there is a molecular mechanism responsible for the selective retention of the α2BAR on the basolateral domain of MDCK cells that may be shared by all three α2AR subtypes, as they manifest comparable half-lives on that surface (17Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Receptor retention on the lateral subdomain of MDCKII cells likely involves the third intracellular loop of the α2AAR, since deletion of this loop, creating the mutant α2AΔ3iAR, results in accelerated basolateral turnover (t½≅ 4.5 h) when compared with that for the wild-type receptor or with α2AAR structures that have been mutated in the N terminus or the C-terminal tail (all possessing at½ of 10–12 h) (18Keefer J.R. Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The accelerated turnover of the α2AΔ3iAR when compared with the wild-type α2AAR structure suggests that the third intracellular loop interacts with proteins that either tether α2AAR to a particular surface domain or, alternatively, mask the α2AAR from interacting with endocytosis machinery. Other functional roles have been attributed to the third intracellular loop of α2AAR. The N- and C-terminal 10–15 residues of the 3i loop, predicted to form amphipathic helices, are involved in coupling to G proteins (19Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 351-358PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal third of the 3i loop of the α2AAR subtype is implicated in the interaction with β-arrestin, a protein that preferentially associates with G protein-coupled receptor kinase-phosphorylated receptors sustaining agonist-elicited homologous desensitization (23Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For the α2AR subtypes, G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation sites are in the N-terminal region of the α2AAR 3i loop (24Jewell-Motz E. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11946-11953Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24753-24760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), widely distributed throughout the α2BAR 3i loop, and presumed to be absent in the α2CAR 3i loop (13Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10093-10099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Liggett S.B. Ostrowski J. Chesnut L.C. Kurose H. Raymond J.R. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies were undertaken to identify interacting proteins for the intracellular 3i loops of the α2AR subtypes.In vitro translation of Gen10-α2AR 3i loop fusion proteins (gen10-α23i) served as a means to create [35S]methionine-radiolabeled 3i loops as ligands for identifying interacting proteins via a gel overlay strategy. Our findings reveal that these loops, in a subtype-selective fashion, interact with the ζ isoform of 14-3-3 proteins (14-3-3ζ). Using a solid phase binding assay with [35S]Met-14-3-3ζ as a probe and solubilized α2AR as the target indicates that 14-3-3 proteins can bind to native α2AR subtypes in a way that relies on the 3i loop in the receptor structure. Further evidence for the functional relevance of these interactions is the ability of a Raf peptide, corresponding to a 14-3-3-interacting domain, to block Gen10-α23i loop interactions with 14-3-3ζ in its phosphorylated, but not in its non-phosphorylated, state. The pGEMEX-2 vector and TNT in vitro translation kit were from Promega (Madison, WI). The [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, at 10 mCi/ml) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. PVDF nylon membranes were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). The FPLC and DEAE-Sephacel columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Dodecyl-β-maltoside and cholesterol hemisuccinate were purchased from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively. Staph A immunoprecipitin was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. 12CA5 monoclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin epitope engineered into the α2AR structures was obtained from Babco; the M2 monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope engineered into the N terminus of 14-3-3ζ was from Eastman Kodak Co., and the rabbit anti-14-3-3β (or pan) and anti-ζ isoform antibodies were from Santa Cruz Laboratories (Santa Cruz, CA).

Chem. 1991; 266: 10470-10478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were subcloned into the pGEMEX-2 vector. The residues utilized are shown schematically in Fig. 2B. These 3i loop sequences were inserted in frame within the polylinker located downstream of the sequence encoding the Gen10 protein, a methionine-rich phage structural protein. The sequence encoding an epitope of the c-Myc protein was inserted 3′ to the sequence of the α2AR 3i loop sequences. The Gen10–3i loop fusion proteins and 14-3-3ζ were produced and [35S]Met-labeled using an in vitro T7 RNA polymerase-coupled translation system in reticulocyte lysates as follows: 25 μl of TNT lysate were added to 1 μl of amino acid mix (1 mm, minus methionine, TNT kit), 2 μl of TNT reaction buffer, 1 μl of TNT T7 RNA polymerase, 4 μl of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, at 10 mCi/ml), 1 μl of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (40 units/μl). Then, 1 μg of the appropriate DNA template (presented as the circular plasmid DNA) was added, and the volume was adjusted to 50 μl with nuclease-free water. The mixture was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. Products were analyzed and quantitated following each synthesis by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and autoradiography, and the band representing each probe was cut out of the dried gel and counted in scintillation mixture. If smaller molecular weight species were generated during the translation reaction, they were eliminated by P30 size exclusion chromatography before use as probes. These 35S-labeled Gen10-α23i loop fusion proteins were used as radioactive ligands in subsequent gel overlay assays as described previously (30Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and detailed below. Frozen pig brain cortex (2 g/preparation) was suspended in 20 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2 with the following protease inhibitors: 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml benzamidine) and homogenized using a Brinkmann Polytron (two 5-s bursts separated by 30 s on ice). The lysate was filtered through cheesecloth to remove debris and then centrifuged at 38,000 ×g in an SS34 rotor (Sorvall RC 5B centrifuge) for 20 min. The supernatant of this centrifugation was removed and designated as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer, homogenized again, this time using a Teflon/glass homogenizer, and centrifuged as before. In early experiments, this pellet was resuspended and an aliquot saved to permit analysis of 3i loop interacting proteins in membrane protein fractions. To resolve proteins in the particulate fraction that could be extracted into Triton X-100, the membrane pellet was re-homogenized into 4 ml of ice-cold detergent-containing buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitors indicated above). All fractions were stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration in each fraction was estimated using the Bradford assay. Cultured MDCK cells (two 100-mm dishes/preparation) were harvested at confluence by scraping into 1 ml of lysis buffer (see above) using a rubber policeman. MDCK cell lysates were disrupted further by 10 up and down passages through a 25-gauge needle mounted onto a 5-ml syringe. The supernatant of the 15 min, 4 °C centrifugation (estimated at 30,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge) was saved and defined as the cytosolic fraction. A gel overlay procedure (31McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Shieh B.H. Zhu M.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) was used to detect binding of [35S]Met-labeled Gen10-α23i loops to fractionated cellular proteins resolved via SDS-PAGE. Protein aliquots (2.5–3.0 mg/sample) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5–20% polyacrylamide gradients on 16-cm long and 1.5-mm thick gels. Prestained molecular weight markers also were run to permit estimation of the approximate molecular weights of the proteins identified by gel overlay analysis. The resolved proteins were transferred at 4 °C to PVDF nylon membranes (Millipore) by electrophoresis overnight at 30 V in Tris/glycine buffer (25 and 192 mm, respectively). The membranes were then cut in 2–4-mm strips for gel overlay and Western blot analysis. For gel overlay analysis, PVDF membranes were blocked at least 1 h in blocking buffer: Tris-HCl/NaCl (50 and 200 mm, respectively, referred to hereafter as TBS), containing Tween 20 (3% v/v) and non-fat powdered milk (5% w/v). The PVDF membranes were then washed for 30 min in rinsing buffer: TBS containing Tween 20 (0.1% v/v) and non-fat powdered milk (5% w/v). The PVDF membrane strips were then incubated with 300,000 cpm of the appropriate [35S]Met-labeled Gen10-α23i loop structure in a 1-ml incubation for 4 h (to overnight) at 4 °C with constant rocking in rinsing buffer. Based on the concentration of methionine contributed to the [35S]Met-labeling reaction by the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (5 μm) and the specific activity of the [35S]Met radiolabel, we estimated that this 300,000 cpm of Gen10-α23i loop represents 5–10 pmol of probe. In experiments where the duration of the incubation or the amount of radioligand was varied, the times and concentrations evaluated are indicated in the figure legends. Following incubation with the various loop structures (or radiolabeled Gen10, as a control), membranes were washed 3 times with rinsing buffer, twice with cold TBS, and air-dried before autoradiography. Autoradiography was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, and band intensities were calculated using the manufacturer's software, presented as arbitrary intensity units. Following quantitation, strips were exposed to x-ray film for 24–72 h. For Raf competition experiments, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides corresponding to a 14-3-3 binding region of Raf-1 (LSQRQRSTS(PO4)TPNVHMV and LSQRQRSTSTPNVHMV, respectively (33Petosa C. Masters S.C. Bankston L.A. Pohl J. Wang B. Fu H. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16305-16310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar)) were incubated with the membranes for 0.5 h prior to the addition of the [35S]Met-labeled Gen10-α23i loop probes, and the incubation was continued for 90 min followed by washing and detection, as described above. For each purification protocol, 15 ml of a cytosolic protein fraction prepared from 2 g of frozen pig brain cortex were loaded onto a 2-ml DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated overnight with ice-cold column equilibration buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors as utilized above). The column pass-through was saved for evaluation of 3i loop binding activity. The DEAE column was washed with 100 ml of 150 mm KCl-containing lysis buffer. The proteins were eluted using a gradient of KCl (from 150 to 500 mmKCl) in lysis buffer, at a rate of 6 ml/h. One-ml fractions were collected and subsequently evaluated for 3i loop binding activity using gel overlay analysis. Preparative gel filtration using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) was performed as follows: a 120-ml Superdex 200 column was equilibrated for 2 h with ice-cold buffer (20 m HEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) at a rate of 2 ml/min. A 2-ml sample, corresponding to peak fractions from the DEAE-Sephacel column, was injected. Eluate fractions (2 ml/fraction) were collected at a rate of 2 ml/min for 2 h. The 3i loop binding activity in individual fractions was determined by assaying aliquots using sequential SDS-PAGE and gel overlay analysis; in some studies, the proteins were concentrated and desalted using Centricon-10 concentrators before assaying 3i loop binding activity. To be confident that the bands on SDS-PAGE manifesting 3i loop binding activity were not “contaminated” by underlying bands, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed using protocols and the tube gel adapter kit provided by Hoefer Scientific instruments. Microsequencing was performed at the Harvard Microsequencing Laboratory facility (Dr. William Lane, Director) by Edman degradation of tryptic digests of the ∼30-kDa bands hydrolyzed in polyacrylamide gels, resolved by high pressure liquid chromatography, and assessed by mass spectrometry. MDCKII cells, parental or stably transfected with the α2A, α2B or α2CAR subtype, were grown to confluence on 150-mm plates, serum-starved overnight, harvested in lysis buffer (15 mm HEPES, 5 mmEGTA, and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.6), containing 10 units/ml aprotinin and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), disrupted using a Teflon/glass homogenizer, split into 2 aliquots, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g. One aliquot was extracted with detergent, and the other was used to monitor receptor available for extraction. For detergent extraction, one pellet was resuspended in 2.25 ml/150-mm plate DβM/CHS extraction buffer (4 mg/ml dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DβM), 0.8 mg/ml cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS), 25 mm glycylglycine, 20 mmHEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), homogenized using a 27-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was defined as the detergent-solubilized receptor. To assess the α2AR binding capacity of these preparations, [3H]rauwolscine was used as a radioligand, and Sephacel G-50 chromatography was used to separate bound from free ligand, as described previously (34Nunnari J.M. Repaske M.G. Brandon S. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12387-12392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the relative efficiency of the detergent to extract receptor from membranes, the results of the G-50 chromatography binding assays were compared with radioligand binding assays performed on the membrane pellet, derived from a fraction of the original preparation, with [3H]rauwolscine. Based on these determinations we estimate that we extract >50% of the α2AR subtypes using this protocol. Equal concentrations of detergent-solubilized receptor were incubated with mouse anti-hemagglutinin antibodies for 1 h and then with 100 μl of protein A-agarose (1:1 slurry with DβM/CHS wash buffer) for a 2nd h. The protein A-agarose was rinsed twice with DβM/CHS wash buffer (1 mg/ml DβM, 0.2 mg/ml CHS, 25 mm glycylglycine, 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm Na, 5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 16 h with [35S]Met-14-3-3ζ rotating end over end at 4 °C. To terminate the incubation, the protein A resin was pelleted at 18,500 × g and rinsed twice with DβM/CHS wash buffer before resuspension in Laemmli buffer and fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried prior to autoradiography; the amount of [35S]Met-14-3-3ζ bound to receptor was quantitated by cutting the bands and counting in NEF 963 scintillation fluor. To assess the extent of non-receptor-dependent [35S]Met-14-3-3ζ binding, detergent extracts of parental MDCKII cells expressing no α2ARs were prepared, and volumes of this extract equal to the largest volume receptor-containing preparations was adsorbed to protein A resin and served as the control for these studies. Because the 3i loops of the α2AAR have been implicated in stabilization of these receptors on the basolateral surface of polarized renal epithelial cells, we sought to identify proteins that interact with these intracellular domains. We created fusion proteins of the 3i loops with the methionine-rich Gen10 protein.In vitro translation of these fusion proteins in the presence of [35S]methionine generated radiolabeled 3i loops that served as ligands for the identification of interacting proteins via gel overlay analysis. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the 3i loops of the α2BAR and α2CAR subtypes readily identified a doublet of apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa in cytosolic fractions of MDCKII cell lysate that was not detected by Gen10 protein or by the 3i loop of the α2AAR under these incubation conditions (see Fig. 2, later, for delayed binding by α2AAR 3i loop). The ∼30-kDa doublet identified by the α2B3i and α2C3i loops is enriched in the cytosolic fraction and is barely detected in the membrane fractions of MDCKII cells. Similar binding profiles were seen in fractions from porcine brain cortex, albeit with greater membrane-associated binding activity, and from lysates of MDCKII cells that had been grown in Transwell® culture to foster polarization (data not shown), consistent with the published experience that confluent MDCKII cells grown in regular culture dishes manifest many of the properties characteristic of the polarized cellular phenotype (16Keefer J.R.

Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A demonstrates the time course for interaction of the α2AR 3i loops with the 30-kDa doublet in porcine brain cytosolic fractions. The 3i loops of the α2BAR and α2CAR interacted more readily and to a significantly greater extent than the 3i loop of the α2AAR subtype, whose binding to the 30-kDa doublet was detectable above background labeling only after longer (>4 h) incubations. When the ability of a 10× molar excess of unlabeled 3i loops to compete for binding of the35S-labeled 3i loops for each subtype was evaluated after a 2- or 4-h incubation, it was evident that competition for the binding of the α2AAR 3i loop was more facile than for the binding of the α2BAR or the α2CAR loop (data not shown), consistent with the apparent lower affinity of the α2AAR 3i loop for the 30-kDa interacting proteins in the gel overlay assay (Fig. 2). The Gen10 fusion protein (control probe) did not compete for any of the 3i loop-specific binding nor did a Gen10 fusion protein encoding 58 amino acids of the distal C-terminal tail of the β1 adrenergic receptor (data not shown), a region previously implicated in β1AR stabilization on the cell surface (36Hertel C.

To reveal the molecular identity of the 30-kDa doublet, we undertook its purification from cytosolic fractions of porcine brain cortex. As shown in Fig. 3A, the interacting proteins were quantitatively adsorbed to DEAE-Sephacel and eluted, using a 50–500 mm KCl gradient, at approximately 250–300 mm KCl (fractions 82–95). Binding to these peak fractions showed a specificity of 3i loop binding characteristic of the unfractionated cytosol, as shown in Fig. 3B. The peak fractions were pooled and purified further using size exclusion FPLC, which removed most of the proteins migrating on SDS-PAGE at >50 kDa and <20 kDa (Fig. 4). The elution position of the 3i loop interacting proteins on FPLC corresponded to an M r of 50,000–80,000 (data not shown), suggesting that the ∼30-kDa proteins on SDS-PAGE may exist as a dimer, in a complex with other proteins, or both.Figure 4FPLC size exclusion chromatography of the 3i loop interacting proteins.

As shown in Fig. 5A, the material migrating in the 30-kDa region on one-dimensional SDS-PAGE was resolved into three distinct spots upon two-dimensional gel analysis, as revealed by Zoion Coomassie staining. Gel overlay analysis indicated that two of the three spots, migrating at isoelectric points of 5 and 5.6, represented the α2AR 3i loop interacting proteins (Fig. 5B). In fact, the spot migrating at a pI of 5.0 has greater35S-Gen10–3i loop binding relative to its Coomassie labeling intensity than the protein migrating with a pI ≅ 5.6. Since the C-terminal tail of both the α2AAR and the β2AR interacts with a ∼30-kDa protein that corresponds to eIF2Bα (38Klein U. Ramirez M.T. Kobilka B.K. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

An example of such integration is evident from our recent finding that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, any failure in the secretory pathway leads to severe repression of transcription of both rRNA and ribosomal protein genes. We have attempted to determine the regulatory circuit(s) that connects the secretory pathway with the transcription of ribosomal genes. Experiments show that repression does not occur through the circuit that responds to misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, nor does it occur through circuits known to regulate ribosome synthesis,e.g. the stringent response, or the cAMP pathway. Rather, it appears to depend on a stress response at the plasma membrane that is transduced through protein kinase C (PKC). Deletion ofPKC1 relieves the repression of both ribosomal protein and rRNA genes that occurs in response to a defect in the secretory pathway. We propose that failure of the secretory pathway prevents the synthesis of new plasma membrane. As protein synthesis continues, stress develops in the plasma membrane. This stress is monitored by Pkc1p, which initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to repression of transcription of the rRNA and ribosomal protein genes. The importance of the transcription of the 137 ribosomal protein genes to the economy of the cell is apparent from the existence of at least three distinct pathways that can effect the repression of this set of genes.

The importance of the transcription of the 137 ribosomal protein genes to the economy of the cell is apparent from the existence of at least three distinct pathways that can effect the repression of this set of genes. The cell has evolved complex mechanisms to reproduce its major components, e.g. its genome, its translational apparatus, and its complement of membranes, including most particularly the plasma membrane. In recent years there have been great strides in understanding the biochemistry and physiology of these systems. Yet we know very little about how they are coordinated, about how the cell manages to maintain balanced output of ribosomes, nuclear envelope, and plasma membrane, to name just a few.In a search for elements regulating the synthesis of ribosomes inSaccharomyces cerevisiae we found an unexpected connection between two of these mechanisms (1Mizuta K. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 2Li B. Warner J.R. J. Biol.

Namely, any failure in the secretory pathway, caused by mutants in components of the early (sec61 and sec63) or late (sec53) endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviation used is: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RP, ribosomal protein; UPR, unfolded protein response; PKC, protein kinase C; CPZ, chlorpromazine.1The abbreviation used is: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RP, ribosomal protein; UPR, unfolded protein response; PKC, protein kinase C; CPZ, chlorpromazine. of the ER-Golgi complex (sly1 and sec18) or of the trans-Golgi network (sec7, sec14, and sec1) leads to a nearly complete repression of the transcription of the genes encoding the components of the ribosome, both those for ribosomal proteins (RPs) and those for ribosomal RNA. Drugs that inhibit different steps of the secretory pathway, such as tunicamycin and brefeldin A, lead to a similar repression of ribosomal genes (1Mizuta K. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).In S. cerevisiae ribosome synthesis accounts for a major portion of the biosynthetic capacity of the cell. We estimate that rRNA transcription represents 60% or more of the total transcription of the cell (3Woolford Jr., J.L. Warner J.R. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis, and Energetics.

Because they have relatively short half-lives, 2B. Li, C. R. Nierras, and J. R. Warner, submitted for publication.2B. Li, C. R. Nierras, and J. R. Warner, submitted for publication. we estimate that transcription of RP genes accounts for ∼50% of the initiation events by RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, ribosome synthesis involves the coordination of ∼100 rRNA genes and 137 RP genes encoding 78 different RPs (7Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Ballesta J.P. Lee J.C. Mizuta K. Suzuki K. Warner J.R.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1920-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).In what way could the secretory pathway be connected to the transcriptional machinery for ribosome synthesis? In yeast, relatively few proteins are secreted, and those are secreted mostly to participate in the construction of the cell wall. The main function of the “secretory pathway” is to construct new membranes. Therefore, we suggest that the repression of the RP genes in response to a defect in the secretory pathway is one manifestation of an intracellular signal transduction pathway that serves to maintain balanced growth of the several components of the cell. If the secretory pathway fails, it is to the advantage of the cell to cease its substantial investment in new ribosomes.We have explored the possible participation of a variety of signal transduction pathways in the regulatory circuit that links membrane synthesis with ribosome synthesis. Neither the unfolded protein response (UPR) known to connect the ER and transcription (17Shamu C.E. Cox J.S. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 56-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), nor the stringent response that represses ribosome synthesis in response to an insufficient supply of amino acids (13Warner J.R. Gorenstein C. Nature. 1978; 275: 338-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Moehle C.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), nor the protein kinase A pathway, which appears to regulate ribosome biosynthesis in response to carbon source, through RAS and cAMP, (16Klein C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1920-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Neuman-Silberberg F.S. Bhattacharya S. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) appear to be involved. Rather, our results suggest that the primary causal event is stress on the plasma membrane, because of continued protein synthesis in the absence of new membrane formation. Protein kinase C (PKC), known to monitor the integrity of the plasma membrane (19Levin D.E. Errede B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 20Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), participates in transducing the signal between the plasma membrane and the transcriptional apparatus.RESULTSIn trying to establish the mechanisms by which a failure in the secretory pathway represses the transcription of the components of the ribosome, there are three general areas to consider: known mechanisms by which aspects of the secretory pathway influence transcription, known mechanisms that govern ribosome synthesis, and known mechanisms by which membrane stress influences transcription.The Repression of RP Genes Is Not Dependent on IRE1The most thoroughly understood relationship between the secretory pathway and the regulation of gene expression is the UPR (for review, see Refs. 30Sidrauski C. Chapman R. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 245-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholarand 31Shamu C.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R121-R123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins within the ER is sensed by the transmembrane kinase Ire1p. Activation of Ire1p kinase effects the production of alternatively spliced mRNA encoding the transcription factor Hac1p (32Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 33Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Hac1p then activates the transcription of the set of UPR-responsive genes (31Shamu C.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R121-R123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including the chaperonin, KAR2, the yeast homolog of mammalian BiP (34Normington K. Kohno K. Kozutsumi Y. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1223-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 35Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Induction of KAR2 therefore requires the presence of IRE1 (36Mori K. Ogawa N. Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 37Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P.

Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar).To ask whether the repression of RP gene transcription was related to the UPR, we attempted to delete the IRE1 gene in our wild type and sly1-1 strains. However, sporulation of anIRE1/ire1Δ SLY1/sly1-1 diploid led to no viableire1Δsly1-1 spores from the dissection of 38 tetrads. Therefore, we conclude that deletion of IRE1 in asly1-1 background is lethal. The presence of thesly1-1 allele leads to modest induction of KAR2even at permissive temperatures (data not shown). Sly1p acts at the level of the ER and Golgi (39Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 40Ossig R. Dascher C. Trepte H.H. Schmitt H.D. Gallwitz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2980-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Perhaps even at the permissive temperature the sly1-1 mutation leads to sufficient disruption of the ER and Golgi that some Kar2p activity is essential to maintain viability.As an alternative, the wild-type strain carrying ire1Δ was treated with tunicamycin, which inhibits protein glycosylation within the ER, activating the UPR (37Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). This leads to a strong induction ofKAR2 (Fig. 1,left), which does not occur in the absence of a functionalIRE1 gene (Fig. 1, right). ACT1transcripts and U3 small nucleolar RNA, used as loading controls, are not affected. The blot was then probed with genes encoding two ribosomal proteins, RPL3 and RPL30. RPL30 was chosen to represent the large majority of RP genes with transcription that is activated by the binding of Rap1p (28Rotenberg M.O. Woolford Jr., J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 674-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 41Schwindinger W.F. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5690-5695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Woudt L.P. Smit A.B. Mager W.H. Planta R.J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); RPL3represents a minority of RP genes with transcription that is activated by the binding of Abf1p (43Hamil K.G. Nam H.G. Fried H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4328-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Each gene is repressed in the presence of tunicamycin (Ref. 1Mizuta K. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar and Fig. 1, left), even in the absence of IRE1 (Fig. 1, right). Because the repression of RP gene transcription does not require Ire1p, it is not a manifestation of the UPR.The Repression of RP Genes Is Not a Classic Stringent ResponseThe classic case of coordinate repression of rRNA and ribosomal protein syntheses is the stringent response inEscherichia coli (for review, see Ref. 44Jensen K.F. Pedersen S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 89-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells deprived of an essential amino acid, protein synthesis declines and transcription of rRNA is repressed, probably by the accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated forms of guanosine, ppGpp and pppGpp. This leads to a subsequent inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis, largely but not entirely mediated through translational control. Transcription of other genes, generally those encoding biosynthetic enzymes, is coordinately induced.S. cerevisiae deprived of an amino acid responds by repressing the transcription of both rRNA and RP genes (13Warner J.R. Gorenstein C. Nature. 1978; 275: 338-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a stringent response by analogy to the phenomenon observed in E. coli. An important corollary of the stringent response is the induction of a number of genes involved in amino acid biosynthetic pathways, such as HIS4 and ARG3 (14Moehle C.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). TreatingS. cerevisiae with the antimetabolite 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole mimics starvation for histidine, also triggering a stringent response, as seen in Fig. 2, lanes 5–8, where HIS4 and ARG3 are strongly induced, and the two RP genes are repressed.Figure 2The repression of RP gene transcription by a secretion defect is not a starvation response. Strain 312,sly1-1, was grown overnight in supplemented minimal media at 23 °C and then either shifted to 37 °C or treated with 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole at 23 °C. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot using radiolabeled probes forACT1, HIS4, ARG3, RPL30,RPL3, or U3. 5 μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Is the repression of RP mRNA transcription in response to a defect in the secretory pathway a manifestation of the stringent response? Disrupting the secretory pathway by shifting a sly1-1 strain to the nonpermissive temperature leads to the usual repression of the RP genes (Fig. 2, lanes 1–4), but there is no concomitant induction of HIS4 or ARG3. Therefore, we conclude that the repression of RP gene transcription attributable to a defect in the secretory pathway is not a manifestation of the stringent response.The Repression of RP Genes Is Not Affected by Activation of Protein Kinase AThe transcription of ribosomal components is exquisitely sensitive to growth conditions, such as nitrogen availability and carbon source (12Kraakman L.S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1920-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), leads to increased transcription of RP genes. If the protein kinase A pathway were responsible for mediating between the secretory pathway and ribosome synthesis, a constitutively activated protein kinase A pathway should prevent the repression of RP gene transcription in response to a defect in the secretory pathway.Strains with a constitutively activated cAMP pathway were constructed in two ways. First, a multicopy plasmid expressing the Ras2Val-19 form of RAS2 (49Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) was introduced into strains that were wild type, sly1, sec1, orsec63. This mutation attenuates the Ras2p GTPase activity, leading to higher concentrations of cAMP, and to other manifestations of the activated protein kinase A response, such as increased sensitivity to heat shock (49Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D. Cameron S. Broach J. Matsumoto K. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 50Kataoka T. Powers S. McGill C. Fasano O. Strathern J. Broach J. Wigler M. Cell. 1984; 37: 437-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Each of the transformed strains was found to have increased sensitivity to a heat shock at 55 °C (data not shown). When sly1-1 or sec1-1 (Fig. 3) or sec63 cells (not shown) were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature, there was in each case a repression of transcription of RP genes that was barely, if at all, affected by the presence of the Ras2Val-19 gene (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 9–12 with lanes 13–16 and 17–20).Figure 3The repression of RP gene transcription by a secretion defect is not affected by Ras. A, Northern analysis of wild-type or secretory mutants transformed with vector (+YCp50) or with plasmid carryingRAS2 Val-19 (+YCpR2V). Cultures were grown overnight in media without uracil at 23 °C and then shifted to 37 °C. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot using radiolabeled probes for ACT1, RPL3,RPL30, or U3. 5 μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane.B, Northern analysis of isogenic strains subjected to heat shock. Cultures were grown overnight in YPD at 23 °C and then shifted to 37 °C. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot using radiolabeled probes for ACT1, RPL3,RPL30, or U3. 5 μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane. The genotypes listed above the lanes represent the following strains (see Table I): SLY1 BCY1, MN15; SLY1 bcy1Δ, MN16; sly1-1 BCY1, MN14; and sly1-1 bcy1Δ, MN13.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An alternate way to constitutively activate the cAMP pathway is by inactivation of Bcy1p, the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. Deletion of BCY1 leads to constitutively high levels of protein kinase A activity (24Cameron S. Levin L. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1988; 53: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 51Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Scott J.D. McMullen B. Hurwitz M. Krebs E.G. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 3B, deletion of BCY1 does not alleviate the repression of RP gene transcription in response to a defect in the secretory pathway (compare lanes 9–12 with13–16). Thus we conclude that a failure in the secretory system represses ribosome synthesis in some way other than the cAMP pathway.In wild-type cells there is a temporary reduction in the level of RP mRNA in response to heat shock (52Kim C.H. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 2). This is attributable to a rapid, temporary repression of transcription of the RP genes that apparently arises from a different cause than the repression connected with a failure of the secretory pathway (1Mizuta K. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).2 It is interesting that this heat shock effect is also independent of a functional protein kinase A pathway (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 6).PKC1 Is Required for the Repression of RP Genes Caused by a Defect in the Secretory PathwayIn what way would failure of the secretory pathway lead to the repression of ribosome synthesis? Manysec-type mutations in genes encoding components of the secretory pathway lead to almost immediate inhibition of secretion after the culture is shifted to the nonpermissive temperature (53Wooding S. Pelham H.R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2667-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, protein synthesis and growth, as estimated from turbidity measurements, continue for nearly a generation. The accumulation of intracellular proteins, under conditions in which there can be no new membrane synthesis, should lead to membrane stretch or osmotic stress, particularly in the rapidly growing bud. One way to mimic such a stretch effect is with CPZ, which inserts into the plasma membrane (54Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). CPZ was added to a culture of S. cerevisiae, and samples were harvested at increasing times to measure the levels of RNAs (Fig. 4). Comparison with the stable U3 snoRNA demonstrates that over 120 min there is little effect on the level of ACT1 mRNA, the intrinsict 1/2 of which is ∼30 min (55Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).2 In contrast CPZ causes a rapid loss of RPL30 mRNA. Because the t 1/2 of RPL30 mRNA is 7–10 min,2 the data of Fig. 4 demonstrate that the transcription of the RP gene is repressed almost immediately. This result suggests a tight connection between events at the plasma membrane and the transcription of RP genes.Figure 4Membrane stretching produced by treatment with chlorpromazine represses RP gene transcription. Strain W303 was grown overnight in YPD at 30 °C and then treated with chlorpromazine to a final concentration of 250 μm. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot using radiolabeled probes for RPL30, ACT1, or U3 as described under “Materials and Methods.” 5 μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane. The graph shows the ratio of RPL30 toACT1 mRNA as a function of time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Do signal transduction pathways responding to the osmotic condition of the cell have an influence on the repression of RP transcription in response to a defect in secretion? There are two such pathways, the high osmotic growth pathway, which responds to high osmotic pressure from the exterior, and the PKC-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which responds to high osmotic pressure from the interior or to defects in the plasma membrane (for review, see Refs. 20Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 56Davenport K.R. Sohaskey M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. J Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30157-30161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We first used congenic strains with a deletion of either HOG1or PBS2, encoding members of the high osmotic growth protein kinase cascade pathway that regulates the transcription of a set of genes in response to an increase in extracellular solutes (57Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 58Brewster J.L. Gustin M.C. Yeast. 1994; 10: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Deletion of either HOG1 or PBS2 had no effect on the repression of transcription of RP genes in response to a temperature-sensitive mutation in SLY1 (data not shown).The PKC pathway is a more likely candidate because it responds to perturbations of the plasma membrane (19Levin D.E. Errede B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 54Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). A complicating factor is that pkc1Δ strains are osmotically sensitive and must be grown with osmotic support, usually 1 m sorbitol (25Levin D.E. Bartlett-Heubusch E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The presence of 1 m sorbitol leads to phenotypic suppression of many temperature-sensitive sec mutants, includingsly1-1 and ypt6-1, presumably because of stabilization of the mutant proteins. However, we find that strains carrying sec1-1 remain temperature-sensitive in the presence of 1 m sorbitol. Therefore, we generated a set of congenic strains with all four combinations of SEC1/sec1-1 and PKC1/pkc1Δ genes (TableI, MN51–MN54).Strains MN51–MN54 were shifted from 23 to 37 °C, and their RNA was analyzed (Fig. 5). It is apparent that the deletion of the PKC1 gene spares the repression of the RP genes that occurs because of a defect in sec1 (Fig. 5, compare lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 15and 16). This occurs both for RP genes that use Rap1p as transcriptional activator (RPL8 and RPL30) as well as for an RP gene that uses Abf1p as a transcriptional activator (RPS28). Note that because all the cultures shown in Fig. 5were grown in the presence of 1 m sorbitol, the osmotic support itself cannot explain the loss of response to the mutantsec1-1 allele. However, it is also apparent from Fig. 5 that Pkc1p is not required for the loss of RP mRNA attributable to heat shock (Fig. 5, compare lanes 2 and 10). This result is further evidence that the repression of RP transcription attributable to a heat shock occurs by a different pathway than the one that responds to a secretion defect.Figure 5pkc1Δ abrogates repression because of a secretion defect. The strains indicated below were grown overnight in YPD plus 1 m sorbitol at 23 °C and then shifted to 37 °C. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot using radiolabeled probes for ACT1,RPL3, RPL8, RPL30, RPS28, or U3. 5 μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane. The genotypes listed above the lanes represent the following strains (see Table I): SEC1 PKC1, MN51; sec1-1 PKC1,"

Immunofluorescence showed that matrilin-2 functions by forming an extracellular, filamentous network. Extracellular matrix provides physical support to the cells, delineates pathways for cell migration during differentiation and tissue regeneration, and provides the necessary milieu for the normal cell metabolism and development. Collagen fibers and proteoglycan aggregates provide the structural basis for matrix architecture. Noncollagenous proteins modulate the organization of these elements, form collagen-associated or independent networks, and are parts of cell migratory pathways. The matrix molecules share homologous modules, protein domains of common evolutionary origin, but a great functional variability of the homologous modules in different proteins has been observed. The recently discovered matrilins (for a review, see Ref. 1Deák F. Wagener R. Kiss I. Paulsson M. Matrix Biol. 1999; (in press): 18Google Scholar) are typical modular proteins belonging to the superfamily with von Willebrand factor type A-like (vWFA) 1The abbreviation used is: vWFA, von Willebrand factor type A-like; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviation used is: vWFA, von Willebrand factor type A-like; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. modules. Members of the matrilin family are found in a wide variety of extracellular matrices. Matrilin-1, formerly called cartilage matrix protein, and matrilin-3 (2Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3Belluoccio D. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) are abundant in cartilage, while matrilin-2 (4Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and matrilin-4 (5Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) show a broader tissue distribution. Thus, all forms of connective tissue appear to contain at least one form of matrilin, indicating a general and important function for this protein family. Matrilin-2 was found to contain the same protein modules in the same order as matrilin-1 (4Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The precursor protein in mouse is 956 amino acids long and consists of a putative signal peptide, two vWFA domains connected by 10 epidermal growth factor-like modules, a potential oligomerization domain, and a unique segment. The ability of the 38 C-terminal amino acid moieties to form an α-helical coiled-coil was shown by Pan and Beck (6Pan O.H. Beck K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14205-14209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Matrilin-2 mRNA was detected by filter hybridization in a variety of mouse organs including calvaria, uterus, heart, and brain as well as fibroblast and osteoblast cell lines. A group of 120–150-kDa bands was, after reduction, recognized specifically with an antiserum against the matrilin-2-glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in media of the matrilin-2-expressing cell lines. Immunolocalization of matrilin-2 in developing skeletal elements showed reactivity in the perichondrium and the osteoblast layer of trabecular bone. In order to gain a better understanding of the potential function of matrilin-2, we have determined the spatial expression of the gene by radioactive in situ hybridization. A new antiserum with a higher titer to the native matrilin-2 was raised using, as an antigen, matrilin-2 expressed in a eukaryotic cell line, and the protein was immunolocalized in mouse tissues. Furthermore, matrilin-2 was purified from media of cells overexpressing the full-length protein and visualized by electron microscopy to provide information on the molecular dimensions and oligomeric structure of the protein. The structural information was extended by SDS-PAGE analysis of the intact protein and the reduced subunits. Posttranslational modification of the protein and alternative splicing of the mRNA were also characterized. Finally, formation of an extracellular network in cultures of cells expressing matrilin-2 was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. The potential function and suggested molecular architecture of the protein is discussed. BALB/c or NMRI mouse strains were used for RNA or protein analysis, respectively. The mouse fibroblastic cell lines WEHI 164 and NIH 3T3, the rat osteogenic sarcoma UMR-106, and the small intestine epithelial IEC-6 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).

Michaelsen (Cologne), using standard methods (14Akita M. Murata E. Schroter-Kermani C. Merker H.J. Pathobiology. 1993; 61: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Unless recommended otherwise by the supplier, the cell lines were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and utilized for RNA and protein analyses. Total RNA was prepared from guanidinium thiocyanate extracts of various cell lines using the RNA isolation kit of Stratagene. For RNA blot analysis, 7-μg aliquots were electrophoresed, blotted to Hybond N filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized consecutively with pCRP12 cDNA (4Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and chicken 27 S rRNA gene fragment. For the study of RNA alternative splicing, total RNA was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) using oligo(dT) primer. Nested polymerase chain reactions were performed using first the distal primers 5′-GGACGGGCTCAGGATGA-3′ and 5′-CTGTATCTCAGGCGATTTTC-3′ and then the proximal primer pair 5′-CATTGACAAGCATCTCTTCT-3′ and 5′-TTTGTGTAGACCGTGAAAGA-3′ flanking the unique region of mouse matrilin-2. For paraffin embedding, tissue specimens were fixed overnight in 95% ethanol, 1% acetic acid; dehydrated in ethanol; cleared in xylol; and embedded in low melting point paraffin (Paraplast, Sigma). Sections of 7–9 μm were cut and mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides. For cryostat sections, specimens were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, 8 mm NaHPO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4; decalcified, if necessary, in 15% EDTA, 2% paraformaldehyde, 4 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.4; and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek Europe). 12-μm sections were cut. For pretreatment, in situhybridization, and washing, the protocol as outlined by Hofstetteret al. (15Hofstetter W. Wetterwald A. Cecchini M.C. Felix R. Fleisch H. Mueller C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9637-9641Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, if necessary, and then digested with proteinase K (1 μg/ml), postfixed, and acetylated in 0.25% acetic anhydride. Riboprobes were labeled with [35S]CTP and hydrolyzed to 150-nucleotide average length. The sections were hybridized for 12–16 h at 53 °C with riboprobes at a final activity of 1–4 × 107 cpm/ml, depending on their length. After hybridization, the tissue sections were washed at 53 °C in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol; treated with RNase T1 (1 unit/ml); and washed again at 53 °C in 50% formamide, 0.2× SSC, 1 mm EDTA. The slides were dehydrated and dipped in LM1 photoemulsion (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiography was performed for 5–10 days, and sections were counterstained in Mayer's hematoxylin (Merck). Partially overlapping cDNA fragments in the mouse matrilin-2 clones pCRP207, pCRP190, and pCRP12 (4Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were combined to full-length cDNA using suitable restriction enzymes. One AflII site was inserted immediately upstream of the first AUG codon by polymerase chain reaction. After digestion with AflII and NotI, a 3.3-kilobase pair cDNA fragment was inserted into the expression vector pCEP-Pu (16Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), cleaved previously withAflII and NotI. The resulting clone, pCEP-Mtr2, encoded the full-length matrilin-2 precursor, including the secretion signal peptide. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into the human embryonic kidney cell line 293-EBNA (Invitrogen), which constitutively expresses the EBNA-1 gene product from Epstein-Barr virus. The transfected cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin and grown to confluency. Secretion of matrilin-2 into the culture medium was verified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, using antiserum against a matrilin-2-glutathioneS-transferase fusion peptide (4Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Serum-free culture medium was dialyzed against 2 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose-FF column. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.4 m NaCl. Fractions eluted between 0.1 and 0.2 m NaCl were pooled, and matrilin-2 was further purified by gel filtration through a Sepharose CL-4B column equilibrated in 2 m urea, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The final purification was achieved on a Heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer. Matrilin-2 bound exclusively to heparin and was eluted at about 0.3 m NaCl. Another cDNA fragment encoding the 10 EGF-like modules and the vWFA2 module of mouse matrilin-2 was inserted into theNheI–NotI sites of the pCEP-Pu vector, downstream of the secretion signal sequence of BM40 (16Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected, and the selection and collection of media followed as mentioned above. The serum-free medium was diluted 3-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and applied to a Q-Sepharose-FF column. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.4 m NaCl. Fractions containing the matrilin-2 fragment were refractionated on a Mono-Q fast protein liquid chromatography column and were apparently free of contaminants. The purified matrilin-2 fragment was used to immunize rabbits. The antiserum was purified by affinity adsorption to the antigen. Cell cultures were grown to confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cell layers were washed and cultured for 48 h without serum, and the medium was harvested. Several mouse organs were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer and extracted with 0.25 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing as protease inhibitors 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatant were analyzed. For immunoblotting, samples were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the protocol of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), using gradient gels of 4–15% polyacrylamide. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose filter and developed with affinity-purified antiserum to matrilin-2, followed by peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO) and the ECL chemiluminescence procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as suggested by the suppliers. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (18Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the affinity-purified anti-matrilin-2 antiserum together with a swine anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase complex and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole as substrate on unfixed cryosections from adult and newborn mouse. For immunofluorescence of cell cultures, cells were plated onto plastic chamber slides, and after reaching confluency they were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. In some experiments, cells were permeabilized by treatment with 10% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubation with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. The cells were treated with the affinity-purified antibody to matrilin-2 for 1 h followed by CyTM3-conjugated affinity-pure goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Pictures were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a fluorescence source. The potential substitution with sulfated glycosaminoglycans was determined by metabolic labeling. 293-EBNA cells transfected with pCEP-Mtr2 were grown in serum- and sulfate-free minimal essential medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After a 48-h labeling period, media were harvested and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 12%). The radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and radioactive bands were visualized by fluorography after treatment with 1m sodium salicylate. Cell culture media from 293-EBNA cells transfected with pCEP-Mtr2 were incubated with 0.7 milliunits/μl heparitinase I (Sigma; fromFlavobacterium heparinum) and 1.7 milliunits/μl chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) for 7 h at 37 °C. Aliquots of the digested and control media were analyzed after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with specific antiserum to matrilin-2. To test for the presence of N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides, 293-EBNA cells transfected with pCEP-Mtr2 were grown in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h in the presence of tunicamycin (Sigma) at 0.5 mg/ml. Media from tunicamycin-treated and control cells were analyzed after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with specific antiserum to matrilin-2. Parallel blots were developed with antibodies to nidogen, which is endogenously produced by the 293-EBNA cells and served as a positive control of better known glycosylation (not shown). Purified matrilin-2 in incubation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mmsodium chloride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS was denatured by heating at 100 °C for 2 min. After denaturation, the protein was incubated with 0.3 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per mg of protein for 20 h at 37 °C. The control sample was treated similarly without adding N-glycosidase F. The digested and control samples were analyzed by 4–15% SDS-PAGE and stained with silver nitrate. Purified matrilin-2 (10 μg/ml) was adsorbed to a 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grid, which was rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. The grid was immediately blotted, washed with two drops of water, and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate for 15 s. Samples were observed in a Jeol 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 60-kV accelerating voltage and × 75,000 magnification. Images were recorded on Kodak ESTAR Thick Base 4489 plates without preirradiation at a dose of typically 2000 electrons/nm2. Evaluation of the data from electron micrographs was done as described previously (19Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding the EGF-like modules and the second vWFA domain of mouse matrilin-2 was inserted into the pCEP-Pu vector, utilizing the secretion signal sequence of BM40 (16Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid was introduced into the 293-EBNA cell line, where it was stably maintained in episomal form. The matrilin-2 fragment, secreted into the tissue culture medium, was purified and used to immunize rabbits. The antiserum, after affinity purification, specifically reacts with matrilin-2 and does not show any cross-reactivity (see Fig. 5A). Matrilin-2 was localized immunohistochemically in cryostat sections of adult and newborn mice (Fig. 1). The protein is most abundant in dense connective tissue, including tendon, ligaments, perichondrium, periosteum, dura mater, epineurium (Fig. 1,G–I); perimysium of skeletal, heart, and smooth muscle (Fig. 1, B, C, E, and G); submucosa of alimentary canal (Fig. 1, E and F); the reticular layer of dermis (Fig. 1, A and G); spleen capsule; and the annulus fibrosus, chordae tendineae, and valves of heart (not shown). In loose connective tissue, local concentration of the protein is not as high. It is most abundant in the papillary layer of dermis (Fig. 1A) and spleen trabeculae (not shown). It is less abundant, but detectable, in the lamina propria of alimentary canal and the tunica adventitia of blood vessels and respiratory tract (not shown in detail). Matrilin-2 is also detectable to variable extents in specialized connective tissue, including the zones of proliferation and hypertrophy in epiphyseal cartilage (Fig. 1G), elastic cartilage of the ear (not shown), fibrocartilage in the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc (Fig. 1, H–I), and bone, where it lines the marrow cavities. The protein was abundant in the myometrium (not shown) and was also detectable between muscularis mucosae and muscularis externa of the alimentary canal, possibly associated with the nervous plexus (Fig. 1E). The amount of the protein was above the detectability threshold in a few specialized epithelia, e.g. the sublingual gland in the newborn head and the lens epithelium or underlying basement membrane of day 16.5 embryos (not shown). In nervous tissue, matrilin-2 was observed in the dura and pia mater of brain and spinal cord as well as the perineurium of peripheral nerves (Fig. 1H). In order to reveal where the matrilin-2 mRNA is produced, eventually leading to extracellular deposition of the protein, we performed in situ hybridization. Three antisense riboprobes, complementary to nonoverlapping regions of the matrilin-2 mRNA were hybridized to cryostat and paraffin sections of 5–10-week-old mouse. The hybridization of the radioactive riboprobe was detected by autoradiography and the silver grains were visualized in dark field. Bright field photomicrographs of the same fields helped to identify the hybridizing tissues in the sections (Fig. 2). Parallel sections were hybridized with sense riboprobes and verified the specificity of hybridization (not shown). The results of in situ hybridization confirmed and extended the data obtained by immunohistochemistry. Connective tissue cells are clearly positive in dense and loose as well as specialized connective tissue. Dense connective tissue fibroblasts show characteristic accumulation of grains in tendon, ligaments, perichondrium, periosteum (Fig. 2, A and B); cells in the reticular layer of dermis and at the base of hair papillae (Fig. 2A); and annulus fibrosus of heart, atrioventricular valve, and chordae tendineae (Fig. 2D). Loose connective tissue cells also gave hybridization signals in the adventitia of trachea (Fig. 2,E and G) and the mesentery cells (Fig. 2C). Matrilin-2 gene expression was observed in epiphyseal cartilage, in the zones of proliferation and early hypertrophy (Fig. 2B), as well as in osteoblasts of the calvaria (not shown). Muscle cells showed a detectable level of gene expression, albeit not as high as that in fibroblasts. A strong in situhybridization signal was observed in the organs where previous Northern hybridization (4Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) showed a high steady state level of matrilin-2 mRNA. The uterus gave an overall strong hybridization signal (Fig. 2C). Heart was also strongly positive, but with a gradient toward the regions richer in connective tissue cells, e.g.the atria, auricle, valves, and chordae tendineae (Fig. 2D). In addition to connective tissue cells and myoblasts, some epithelia also showed clearly positive hybridization signals. In paraffin sections, the secretory epithelium of esophagus, the mucosa, and serosa of colon as well as the seromucous glands of trachea showed strong hybridization (Fig. 2, E–H). In some cases it was difficult to determine with certainty the cell types where the gene expression was observed by in situ hybridization. For example, smooth muscle cells are in close association with fibroblasts, and epithelial cells form thin layers in close proximity to the underlying connective tissue. Therefore, we examined matrilin-2 mRNA and protein production in homogeneous cultures of permanent cell lines. Total RNA samples were isolated from cultured cells, and the relative amount of matrilin-2 mRNA was estimated by Northern hybridization (Fig. 3). In all of the cell lines examined, expression of the gene was observed. We previously demonstrated that the fibroblastic cell lines L929, WEHI 164, NIH 3T3, and the rat osteogenic sarcoma UMR-106 expressed the gene (4Deák F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present experiment, the mRNA level in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3,lane 1) was compared with other cell lines. In two samples, isolated from the rat chondrosarcoma cell line and the 9E11G smooth muscle-like cells, the matrilin-2 mRNA level was higher than in NIH3T3 cells. The other smooth muscle cell line, SMC, isolated from rat aorta, and the differentiated skeletal muscle myotube C2/7 contained less, but significant, amounts of matrilin-2 mRNA, confirming that the gene can be expressed in cells with myoblast characteristics. The intestinal epithelial cell line IEC6 and the Schwannoma cell line RN22 also expressed the gene at a detectable level. The least amount of matrilin-2 mRNA was found in the keratinocyte carcinoma PVD(A)I. In a separate experiment, matrilin-2 mRNA was detected in the SVEC endothelial cell line (not shown). In summary, not only the connective tissue cell types contained matrilin-2 mRNA, but gene expression was also observed in myoblasts and in the epithelial and endothelial cell lines tested. Previous analysis indicated that the sequence variability within the unique region may be a consequence of alternative splicing. Therefore, we performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis to determine if there is further mRNA heterogeneity within the translated region. In the SVEC endothelial and the rat chondrosarcoma cell lines, alternative splicing affected only the middle third of the unique module but not the region encoding the coiled coil, the vWFA2, or EGF-like modules (data not shown). Systematic comparison of the RNA samples showed that a 57-nucleotide-long region is alternatively retained or spliced out in all of the 10 cell lines studied (Fig. 4). In order to gain information about the relative amount and presumed oligomeric structure of matrilin-2, culture media from cell lines and extracts from tissues were compared by SDS-PAGE and, in part, immunoblotting to the matrilin-2 expressed by transfected cells (Fig. 5C). The specificity of the antiserum was assessed by comparison of media from 293-EBNA cells before and after transfection with the recombinant plasmid pCEP-Mtr2, encoding the full-length mouse matrilin-2 (Fig. 5A). The transfected cells secreted into the culture medium matrilin-2, which was detected by the antiserum as a group of antigenic bands in nonreducing SDS-PAGE with apparent M r values ranging from 70,000 to 500,000. On the basis of the calculatedM r = 104,300 for the nonmodified matrilin-2 monomer, faster migrating bands must represent degradation products, and the slower ones may correspond to oligomeric forms. We can conclude that the secretory signal peptide of matrilin-2 was functionally active in 293-EBNA cells and that matrilin-2 can form oligomers stable enough to resist denaturing electrophoresis if the sample is not reduced. The medium from nontransfected 293-EBNA cells did not show any reactivity with the antiserum, demonstrating the specificity of this reagent. The relative amounts of the different forms of matrilin-2, resolved by electrophoresis, differ somewhat between the crude media of transfected cells and preparations chromatographically purified from this source (Fig. 5B). The reason for this difference is that during purification we removed degradation fragments and enriched slightly for the oligomeric forms. Reduction of the purified material yielded several closely spaced bands with apparent M rvalues between 100,000 and 130,000. The size heterogeneity was even more apparent when nonreduced samples from media of a variety of cell lines as well as extracts of skin and uterus were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5C). All the cell lines tested secreted detectable amounts of matrilin-2, with the exception of the epithelial cell line IEC6. Because the IEC6 cells showed production of matrilin-2 mRNA, we need to assume that the mRNA is translated and/or the protein is secreted with a very low efficiency in that cell line. While the 293-EBNA cells that had been transfected with pCEP-Mtr2 produced four groups of bands that may represent monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers, most cell lines secreted mainly the smallest and largest components. Extracts of skin and uterus showed, in addition, a relative abundance of the potential trimers. The analysis was, however, complic"
https://openalex.org/W2129582202,"The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is involved in transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling in a variety of cell systems. We report here that hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a novel Ste20-like protein serine/threonine kinase, serves as an upstream mediator for the TGF-β-activated JNK1 cascade in 293T cells. TGF-β treatment resulted in a time-dependent activation of HPK1, which was accompanied by similar kinetics of JNK1 activation. The activation of JNK1 by TGF-β was abrogated by a kinase-defective HPK1 mutant but not by a kinase-defective mutant of kinase homologous to Ste20/Sps1. This result indicates that HPK1 is specifically required for TGF-β-induced activation of JNK1. We also found that TGF-β-induced JNK1 activation was blocked by a kinase-defective mutant of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). In addition, interaction between HPK1 and TAK1 was observed in transient transfection assays, and this interaction was enhanced by TGF-β treatment. Both stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (SEK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) are immediate upstream activators of JNK1. Although SEK and MKK7 acted downstream of TAK1, only a kinase-defective SEK mutant blocked TGF-β-induced activation of JNK1, indicating that the TGF-β signal is relayed solely through SEK, but not MKK7,in vivo. Furthermore, TGF-β-induced activating protein 1 activation was blocked by a HPK1 mutant, as well as by TAK1 and SEK mutants. Taken together, these studies establish a potential cascade of TGF-β-activated interacting kinases beginning with HPK1, a Ste20 homolog, and ending in JNK1 activation: HPK1 → TAK1 → SEK → JNK1.

TGF-β initiates its pleiotropic effects by binding a heteromeric cell surface receptor complex composed of type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor, which confers ligand binding specificity, phosphorylates the type I receptor, which confers signal specificity, in the highly conserved GS domain, thereby activating type I receptor kinase activity toward its downstream effectors (reviewed in Refs. 1Massague J.

The core of the MAPK cascades is a three-kinase module involving a sequential protein kinase reaction (reviewed in Refs. 11Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet.

For example, the prototype module for the JNK pathway is MEKK1-SEK-JNK. However, a growing list of protein kinases at every level of the three-kinase module has been identified, such as TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), MAPK upstream kinase (MUK), and mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) at the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) level (11Fanger G.R.

Moreover, epistasis analyses in yeast have identified Ste20 as the further upstream kinase, MAPKKK kinase (MAPKKKK), for the Ste11(MAPKKK)-Ste7(MAPKK)-Fus/Kss1(MAPK) module (15Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Two subgroups of mammalian Ste20-like kinases have also been identified. One subgroup consists of p21cdc42/rac1-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) and PAK1-related kinases, which contain a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain containing a p21cdc42/rac1-binding region (16Manser E.

This subgroup of Ste20-like kinases is characterized by an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal region of unknown function and by the lack of a Rac1/Cdc42-binding domain found in PAKs. Although HPK1 is widely expressed in embryonic tissues, its expression is restricted to hematopoietic tissues in adults (19Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H.

Because its physiological activator(s) has not been identified, the biological function of HPK1 and the mechanisms of HPK1 signaling are currently unknown. However, a potential association between HPK1 and several protein-tyrosine kinase receptors mediated by SH2/SH3 adaptor proteins has recently been reported (26Anafi M. Kiefer F. Gish G.D. Mbamalu G.

We have previously shown in transfected 293T cells that TAK1, a TGF-β-activated MAPKKK level kinase, serves downstream of HPK1 and upstream of SEK in the JNK pathway (10Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C.-T. Yao Z. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because TAK1 is a potential mediator of TGF-β signal transduction (29Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K.

The studies presented here show that TGF-β treatment of 293T cells resulted in a marked and persistent increase in HPK1 activity and that HPK1 was required for the activation of JNK and activating protein 1 (AP-1) by TGF-β. These studies establish that HPK1 acts as an upstream activator for the TAK1-SEK-JNK1 module in relaying the TGF-β signal into the nuclei in 293T cells.

The JNK signaling pathway is activated by TGF-β in a variety of cellular systems, including 293T cells (7Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Lett. 1997; 117: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 628-633PubMed Google Scholar, 9Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that TAK1, a TGF-β-activated kinase, is a potent activator for JNK and serves downstream of HPK1, a MAPKKKK level kinase, in the JNK pathway (10Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C.-T. Yao Z. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We were thus prompted to address whether HPK1 is involved in TGF-β signaling in vivo. Using an HPK1-specific antibody Ab2025 (19Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we detected a high level of HPK1 expression in human embryonic kidney 293 and 293T cells (Fig. 1A). Cell fractionation analysis indicates that HPK1 is localized in the cytosol but not in the nucleus of 293 cells (Fig. 1A). To study the role of HPK1 in TGF-β signaling, 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged HPK1, and following TGF-β treatment, the FLAG-HPK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (M2). HPK1 activity was determined by an immunocomplex kinase assay using myelin basic protein as substrate. TGF-β treatment resulted in a time-dependent activation of HPK1 (Fig. 1B). The increased kinase activity was not due to various levels of HPK1 because an equivalent expression of FLAG-HPK1 was detected by immunoblotting analysis with anti-FLAG antibody (M2) (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Endogenous HPK1 immunoprecipitated with an anti-HPK1 antibody (Ab2025) was also activated by TFG-β with similar kinetics (data not shown). To address a possible link between HPK1 and JNK in response to TFG-β, endogenous JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-JNK1 antibody (Ab101) from the FLAG-HPK1-transfected cell lysates, and its activity was determined by an immunocomplex kinase assay using GST-c-Jun (1–79) as substrate. Fig. 1C shows that endogenous JNK1 was activated by TFG-β with kinetics similar to that of HPK1. Thus, HPK1 was activated concomitant with JNK1 in response to TGF-β in 293T cells. To investigate the involvement of HPK1 in TGF-β-induced JNK1 activation, we attempted to block the signaling cascade with HPK1-M46, an HPK1 kinase-defective mutant in which methionine is substituted for lysine 46 (19Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with HA-JNK1 alone or with HA-JNK1 plus various amounts of HPK1-M46. Following TGF-β treatment, HA-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody (12CA5), and the JNK1 activity was measured. Fig. 2A shows that TGF-β-induced JNK1 activation was blocked by cotransfected HPK1 mutant (HPK1-M46) in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, cotransfection of HA-JNK1 with KHS-KR, a kinase-defective mutant of KHS (22Tung R.M. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), another MAPKKKK level kinase, had no inhibitory effect on JNK1 activation by TGF-β. These data indicate that HPK1 is specifically required for the transduction of TGF-β signal to JNK1 activation. To further confirm the specific involvement of HPK1 in TGF-β-induced JNK1 activation, we tested the effect of the HPK1 mutant on JNK1 activation by UV-C, a potent stimulus for the JNK pathway (33Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 34Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). UV-C-induced JNK1 activation was blocked by HGK-KR, a kinase-defective mutant of HGK, a MAPKKKK level kinase (24Yao Z. Zhou G. Wang X.S. Brown A. Diener K. Gan H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, cotransfected HPK1 mutant HPK1-M46 had no effect on UV-C-induced JNK1 activation (Fig. 2B). Thus, HPK1 acts as a specific mediator for TGF-β-induced JNK1 signaling pathway. TAK1, a member of the MAPKKK family, has been shown as a potential mediator of TGF-β signal transduction (29Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that TAK1 is a potent JNK activator and a mediator of HPK1-induced JNK activation (10Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C.-T. Yao Z. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Given that HPK1 is required for the activation of JNK1 by TGF-β (shown above), we wondered whether TAK1 is an in vivo component of the JNK1 signaling cascade triggered by TGF-β in 293T cells. To address this question, we investigated whether JNK1 activation by TGF-β is blocked by a kinase-defective mutant of TAK1, TAK1-K63W. Cotransfection of 293T cells with HA-JNK1 and TAK1-K63W abolished TGF-β-induced JNK1 activation (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). We did not observe interference with TGF-β-induced activation of JNK1 by a dominant-negative mutant of MEKK1 (lanes 5 and 6). Further evidence for the specific involvement of TAK1 in TGF-β-induced JNK1 activation is provided by the inability of the kinase-defective mutant of MUK, another MAPKKK level kinase (36Hirai S. Izawa M. Osada S. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar), to block the JNK1 activation by TGF-β (data not shown). Therefore, TAK1 is likely an in vivo signaling component of TGF-β-activated JNK1 pathway in 293T cells. Complex formation exists widely in signaling processes and is an important mechanism to facilitate signal transduction and maintain signaling specificity. This led us to investigate whether HPK1 interacts with TAK1 in vivo by a coimmunoprecipitation assay. HA-tagged TAK1 and FLAG-tagged HPK1 were overexpressed by transient transfection in 293T cells. When an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) was used to precipitate HA-TAK1, FLAG-HPK1 was co-precipitated (Fig. 4A, left panel). Conversely, HA-TAK1 was co-precipitated with FLAG-HPK1 when an anti-FLAG antibody (M2) was used to precipitate FLAG-HPK1 (Fig. 4A, right panel). These data indicate that a complex was formed between HPK1 and TAK1. Moreover, TGF-β treatment significantly enhanced the complex formation between HPK1 and TAK1 (Fig. 4B). Thus, HPK1 interacted with TAK1 in 293T cells, and this interaction was enhanced in response to TGF-β. Both SEK (37Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar) and MKK7 (13Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 14Yao Z. Diener K. Wang X.S. Zukowski M. Matsumoto G. Zhou G. Mo R. Sasaki T. Nishina H. Hui C.C. Tan T.-H. Woodgett J.P. Penninger J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32378-32383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) are kinases that lie immediately upstream of JNK. We were interested in determining which MAPKK (either SEK, MKK7, or both) relays the TGF-β signal from TAK1 to JNK1 activation in 293T cells. We examined the ability of kinase-defective SEK and MKK7 mutants to block JNK1 activation by TAK1 and TGF-β. TAK-induced JNK1 activation was abrogated by both SEK and MKK7 mutants in transient transfection assays (Fig. 5A). However, only the SEK mutant blocked TGF-β-induced JNK1 activation, whereas the MKK7 mutant exerted no effect (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that it is SEK but not MKK7 that acts downstream of TAK1 and serves as an endogenous regulator that relays the TGF-β signal to activate JNK1 in 293T cells. The JNK signaling pathway has been implicated in AP-1-dependent gene expression because c-Jun, one component of the AP-1 complex, is a substrate for JNK in vivo (38Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). TGF-β also exerts many of its effects through AP-1 gene expression (39Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 40Martin M. Vozenin M.C. Gault N. Crechet F. Pfarr C.M. Lefaix J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To further confirm the functional involvement of HPK1 in TGF-β-induced JNK1 activation, we investigated the effect of the HPK1 mutant on TGF-β-induced AP-1 activity. AP-1 activity was increased by TGF-β in a time-dependent manner, peaking at 24 h (data not shown). We cotransfected a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct containing multiple c-Jun-binding sites (5xTRE-CAT) with or without HPK1-M46 into 293T cells. TGF-β-stimulated AP-1 activity was blocked by HPK1-M46 (Fig. 6). As expected, cotransfection of the TAK1 mutant or the SEK1 mutant also abrogated the TGF-β-induced AP-1 activity (Fig. 6). The CAT activity of the various transfectants correlated closely with the activation of JNK1 (data not shown), indicating that JNK1 activation contributed to the TGF-β-induced, AP-1-dependent CAT activity. Taken together, these data indicate that HPK1 is required for TGF-β-induced, JNK1-mediated AP-1 activation. There is a growing interest in the identification and characterization of Ste20-like kinases, because they might represent the first step in a number of linear cascades of sequentially acting serine/threonine kinases leading to the stimulation of members of the MAPK superfamily. Here we present the evidence that HPK1, a novel Ste20/PAK-like protein, serine/threonine kinase, and a potent activator of JNK, acts as an upstream regulator for the JNK1 signaling cascade triggered by TGF-β. The evidence includes: (i) HPK1 activation by TGF-β was accompanied by similar kinetics of JNK1 activation; (ii) TGF-β-induced activation of JNK1 was specifically blocked by an HPK1 kinase-defective mutant; (iii) TGF-β enhanced the interaction between HPK1 and TAK1, a TGF-β-activated MAPKKK level kinase, which is also required for TGF-β-induced JNK1 activation; and (iv) TGF-β -induced, JNK1-mediated AP-1 activation was abrogated by an HPK1 kinase-defective mutant. The functional significance of the activation of HPK1 by TGF-β has not been completely understood. It has been recently shown that HPK1 specifically interacts with adaptor proteins, such as Crk, CrkL, and Grb2, and through these adaptor proteins connects to the membrane tyrosine kinase receptors (26Anafi M. Kiefer F. Gish G.D. Mbamalu G. Iscove N.N. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Oehrl W. Kardinal C. Ruf S. Adermann K.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that the JNK cascade is activated through a specific interaction between HPK1 and an adaptor protein that connects it to the TGF-β receptor complex. This hypothesis is supported by the recent finding that GCK, another member of the HPK1 subfamily of mammalian Ste20 homologs, interacts in vivo with the tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1-associated factor-2 and with MEKK1, thereby acting as a molecular bridge and coupling tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1-associated factor-2 to the JNK signaling pathway (41Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). TAK1 was originally identified as a TGF-β-responsive MAPKKK level kinase (29Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). It has been shown that TAK1 can activate SEK, an immediate upstream activator kinase of JNK, in vitro (29Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar), suggesting that TAK1 might be involved in mediating TGF-β-induced JNK activation. However, no direct evidence for this has been given so far, although TAK1 has been shown to mediate JNK activation by other stimuli, such as ceramide (42Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Here we presented data showing that TGF-β-stimulated JNK1 and AP-1 activation in 293T cells was completely abrogated by a kinase-defective TAK1 mutant. Moreover, by using an immunoprecipitation approach, we found that HPK1 interacted with TAK1 and that this interaction was greatly enhanced by TGF-β. Thus, these results indicate that TAK1 mediates TGF-β signaling to JNK1 activation and subsequent AP-1 activation, although we have not yet examined the activation of TAK1 by TGF-β in our system. This conclusion is also in line with our previous observation that TAK1 acts downstream of HPK1 and mediates HPK1-induced JNK activation (10Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C.-T. Yao Z. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The MAPK cascades can be activated by multiple extracellular stimuli with little apparent commonality in the cellular effects, such as cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and stresses (11Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 12Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The mechanism that determines MAPK signaling specificity in response to diverse extracellular stimuli has not been fully characterized. We report here that TGF-β-induced JNK1 activation was only blocked by the SEK1 mutant but not the MKK7 mutant at the MAPKK level, and by the TAK1 mutant but not the MEKK1 and MUK mutants at the MAPKKK level. These results imply that a mechanism might exist to ensure the correct recruitment of TGF-β-specific JNK signaling components in vivo. This idea is supported by the recent discovery that the mammalian scaffold protein JIP1 preferentially binds MKK7 but not SEK, thus assembling the selective MAPK module MLK3-MKK7-JNK (43Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The differential responses of SEK and MKK7 to extracellular stimuli have also been reported. For example, UV and anisomycin strongly activate SEK; however, MKK7 is only weakly activated (44Lu X. Nemoto S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24751-24754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, the differential activation of SEK and MKK7 was observed in MST/MLK2-dependent activation of JNK in which MST/MLK2 activates recombinant MKK7 more efficiently than recombinant SEK, whereas MEKK1 activates both to a similar extent (45Hirai S. Noda K. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Yamashita A. Deyama T. Fukuyama K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7406-7412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, the signaling leading to JNK activation may diverge upstream of JNK at the various levels of the kinase module. An emerging property of signal transduction pathways that might account for signaling specificity is the formation of signaling complexes. These complexes may result from the preferred physical interaction between kinases within a module (12Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 46Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The inducible interaction between HPK1 and TAK1 by TGF-β, combined with the requirement of HPK1 for TGF-β-induced JNK activation and the specific blockage of TGF-β-induced JNK activation by the TAK1 mutant, strongly indicates that HPK1 might have a recruiting function, coupling a TGF-β signal to TAK1.

Insulin deficiency results in a decrease in liver GH receptor (GHR) expression, which can be reversed by insulin administration. In osteoblasts, continuous insulin treatment decreases the fraction of cellular GHR localized to the plasma membrane. Thus, it is not clear whether hyperinsulinemia results in an enhancement or inhibition of GH action. We asked whether continuous insulin stimulation, similar to what occurs in hyperinsulinemic states, results in GH resistance. Our present studies suggest that insulin treatment of hepatoma cells results in a time-dependent inhibition of acute GH-induced phosphorylation of STAT5B. Whereas total protein levels of JAK2 were not reduced after insulin pretreatment for 16 h, GH-induced JAK2 phosphorylation was inhibited. There was a concomitant decrease in GH binding and a reduction in immunoreactive GHR levels following pretreatment with insulin for 8–24 h. In summary, continuous insulin treatment in rat H4 hepatoma cells reduces GH binding, immunoreactive GHR, GH-induced phosphorylation of JAK2, and GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5B. These findings suggest that hepatic GH resistance may develop when a patient exhibits chronic hyperinsulinemia, a condition often observed in patients with obesity and in the early stage of Type 2 diabetes.

Common to all of these conditions is an increase in the ratio of insulin to GH (1Ho K.K. O'Sullivan A.J. Hoffman D.M. Endocr. J. 1996; 43 (suppl.): 63Google Scholar, 2Bjorntorp P.

The GHR belongs to the superfamily of cytokine receptors and in humans and rabbits the full-length GHR is translated from a single mRNA (7Baumann G. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1995; 103: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Circulating GHBP results from proteolytic cleavage of the plasma membrane-associated GHR (7Baumann G. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1995; 103: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, a recent study suggests that primate GHBP may also arise from an alternatively spliced mRNA, a mechanism first indicated in rodents (7Baumann G. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol.

Binding of GH to its receptor results in dimerization of the receptor followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of GHR itself and tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Janus activating kinase 2 (JAK2) (9Argetsinger L.S.

Although GH promotes activation of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, and STAT5B, gene disruption experiments indicate that STAT5B is necessary for GH regulation of sexually dimorphic hepatic genes (10Carter-Su C.

In streptozotocin-treated rats, circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), whose mRNA expression is regulated by GH, is reduced as is GH binding capacity. Insulin treatment restores IGF-1 levels and in some, but not all experiments, restores GH binding (14Baxter R.C. Bryson J.M. Turtle J.R.

In Type 1 diabetic patients intraperitoneal insulin administration restores GHBP levels better than subcutaneous insulin treatment (19Hanaire-Broutin H. Sallerin-Caute B. Poncet M.F. Tauber M. Bastide R. Chale J.J. Rosenfeld R. Tauber J.P. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1498-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,20Hanaire-Broutin H. Sallerin-Caute B. Poncet M.F. Tauber M. Bastide R.

This suggests that peripheral (subcutaneous) insulin administration may result in portal insulin concentrations insufficient, compared with intraperitoneal insulin infusion, to properly regulate hepatic GHR expression and therefore circulating GHBP. Patients with Type 2 diabetes and peripheral insulin resistance also exhibit reduced circulating IGF-1 levels, possibly due to a decrease in GH responsiveness, but it has not yet been studied whether liver GHR or circulating GHBP levels are reduced accordingly (18Kratzsch J. Kellner K. Zilkens T. Schmidt-Gayk H. Selisko T. Scholz G.H. Clin. Endocrinol. (Oxf.). 1996; 44: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,23Mercado M. Molitch M.E. Baumann G. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In vitro studies are also inconsistent concerning whether insulin can increase GH binding and GHR mRNA. For example, in a study with primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, insulin treatment increases GH binding 4-fold with no significant effect on GHR mRNA expression (28Tollet P. Enberg B. Mode A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1934-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In a study measuring the subcellular localization of GHR in osteoblasts, continuous insulin treatment decreases the fraction of cellular GHR presented at the plasma membrane via inhibition of surface translocation of GHR with no effect on the total cellular content of GHR (29Leung K.C. Waters M.J. Markus I. Baumbach W.R. Ho K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11381-11386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, changes in GH-induced signaling pathways have not been investigated in these studies measuring insulin-induced changes in GHR and GH binding. There is impaired GH action after 60 years of age in humans, possibly resulting from decreases in circulating GHBP levels, and therefore most likely hepatic GHR levels (30Maheshwari H. Sharma L. Baumann G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 995-997PubMed Google Scholar). Also, there may be defects in GH stimulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in aging humans, as there are in aging mice (31Xu X. Bennett S.A. Ingram R.L. Sonntag W.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4551-4557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, investigation of factors that affect GH responsiveness may help in the understanding of aging-related changes in GH action. In the present study, insulin pretreatment for 8–24 h was found to reduce the acute effect of GH on STAT5B phosphorylation in rat H4 hepatoma cells. The GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, immunoreactive GHR, and binding of 125I-hGH were also reduced following insulin pretreatment. Inhibition of GH-induced STAT5B phosphorylation, immunoreactive GHR, and GH binding were all reduced by insulin pretreatment with similar kinetics. Our study indicates an extensive reduction in hepatoma cell GH responsiveness following conditions that may mimic the chronic hyperinsulinemia observed in some obese patients and patients in the early stages of Type 2 diabetes. Bovine GH (bGH; lot number APF11182B) and ovine prolactin (oPRL, NIDDK-oPRL-21; lot number AFP-10692C) were kindly provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow, Pituitary Hormones and Antisera Center, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (Torrance, CA) and the NIDDK, National Institutes of Health National Hormone & Pituitary Program. The125I-human GH (125I-hGH) was purchased from NENTM Life Science Products. Porcine sodium-insulin was a gift from Dr. Ron Chance (Eli Lilly, Co., Indianapolis, IN) and unlabeled hGH was also kindly provided by Eli Lilly, Co. Fetal bovine serum, calf serum, and horse serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Protein G-Sepharose was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden) and ECL detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Corp. Other materials were purchased from Sigma and Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA) unless otherwise noted. Anti-STAT5 monoclonal antibody (raised against amino acid 451–649 of sheep STAT5A) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse anti-STAT5A (raised against the unique C terminus of murine STAT5A) and mouse anti-STAT5B (raised against the unique C terminus of murine STAT5B) monoclonal antibodies and rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine-STAT5 polyclonal antibodies (raised against the phospho-peptide around C-terminal Y694 of murine STAT5A that is conserved in both STAT5A and STAT5B of human, sheep, and rat) were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Rabbit anti-JAK2 peptide antiserum, directed at residues 758–776 of murine JAK2 (called anti-JAK2UBI), and 4G10 mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). A second anti-JAK2 serum (anti-JAK2AL33) was raised in rabbits against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein incorporating residues 746–1129 of the murine JAK2, as described (32Frank S.J. Yi W.

Two anti-GHR antisera were raised in rabbits against peptides of the cytoplasmic domain of the GHR: anti-GHRcyt3728 against residues 317–620 of the human GHR cytoplasmic domain and anti-GHRcytAL37 against residues 271–620 fused to glutathione S-transferase as described (33Jiang J.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies including the peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse serum and the peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit serum were obtained from Amersham Life Science. Rat H4-II-E (H4) hepatoma cells were cultured in Swim's medium supplemented with 10% serum mixture (5% horse serum, 3% newborn calf serum, and 2% fetal calf serum) and 2 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate (35Messina J.L. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At about 50% confluence, cells were removed from serum and maintained in serum-free media for 24 h prior to protein extraction. Hormone treatment (detailed in the text) was terminated by rinsing the cells once with TBS (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and cells were collected in 100 °C SDS-lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4) and boiled for 5 min. One volume of 4 × Laemmli sample buffer (8% SDS, 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) was added to 3 volumes of whole cell lysates, the solution was boiled for an additional 5 min and stored at −80 °C until subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In an alternative method, cells were scraped into 4 °C TBS plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4 and cell pellets were collected by centrifugation (800 × g for 2 min at 4 °C). Cell pellets were solubilized with mild agitation for 1 h at 4 °C in Triton-lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4O7P2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were immediately subjected to either immunoprecipitation or were boiled for 5 min in sample loading buffer, and stored at −80 °C until electrophoresis. For immunoprecipitation in nondenaturing conditions, cells were lysed in Triton-lysis buffer. Protein G-Sepharose was used to adsorb immune complexes and after extensive washing with Triton-lysis buffer precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in sample loading buffer for 5 min. The proteins were then subjected to 5–9% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western transfer of proteins were performed as described previously, except for the use of Protran membrane from Schleicher & Schuell (BA 85) (34Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Van Epps C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed with the antibodies at the following dilutions: anti-STAT5 (1:500), anti-STAT5A (1:5000), anti-STAT5B (1:5000), anti-PY-STAT5 (1:5000), 4G10 (1:2500), anti-GHRcyt3728 and anti-GHRcytAL37 (1:2000), or anti-JAK2 (1:2000) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:2000). Incubation with rabbit primary antisera was at 4 °C overnight, while incubation with mouse monoclonal antibodies was at room temperature for 1 h. Washing times after primary and secondary antibodies were at room temperature for 10 and 45 min, respectively, unless specified. Washing times after anti-GHRcyt3728 and anti-rabbit IgG were at room temperature for 90 and 20 min, respectively. All antibodies are used in 0.7% Tween 20 in TBS, pH 8.0, with 0.4% milk, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.04% azide added to the primary antibodies except for 4G10, in which milk was excluded. Detection of bound antibodies by ECL and stripping and reprobing of blots were accomplished according to the manufacturer's suggestions. H4 cells were grown to 50% confluence in 60-mm plates and treated as indicated in the text before partial withdrawal of media to reduced volume to 1 ml. Cells were then incubated with a constant amount of 125I-hGH within a given experiment (between 6 × 105 and 9 × 105 cpm per plate in the separate experiments) with or without 2 μg/ml unlabeled hGH, bGH, or oPRL at room temperature for 2 h with gentle agitation (36Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 37Messina J.L. Eden S. Kostyo J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: E56-E62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation, binding was measured by washing the cells twice with 2 ml of 4 °C binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), harvesting the cells in a buffer of 1% SDS, 0.1n NaOH and counting in an γ-counter (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). ECL images of immunoblots were scanned and quantified with a Scion-image analysis program (release beta 2) from Scion Corp. (Frederick, MD). All data was analyzed by ANOVA using the InStat statistical program (version 3) by GraphPad Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA). We first asked whether the STAT5 proteins were expressed at appreciable amounts in rat H4 hepatoma cells. Using a pan-STAT5 antibody, the immunoreactive STAT5 bands from whole cell extracts from untreated H4 cells migrated as at least 3 bands. From previously published studies, and as confirmed here with isoform-specific antibodies, the upper band that runs as p95 or p96, depending upon the study (and referred to as p95/p96) was specific for STAT5A (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3). The lower p92/p94 doublet was STAT5B with the doublet arising because a fraction of the STAT5B is serine-phosphorylated, even in quiescent cells, and thus displays retarded migration (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2, and Refs. 38Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar and 39Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As observed in Fig. 1A, lane 1, using the pan-STAT5 antibody, there was less STAT5A than STAT5B (approximately 70% as much STAT5A as STAT5B by densitometry) in H4 cell extracts. We then asked whether insulin altered the cellular levels of the STAT5 isoforms. Using the pan-STAT5 antibody, there was no appreciable change in cellular STAT5 levels following insulin treatment of H4 cells for 4 and 12 h (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3). Using the STAT5B-specific antibody, a slight reduction of STAT5B was sometimes observed following insulin treatment for 12, 20, and 24 h (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–5). When multiple experiments were quantified by densitometry (Fig. 1D), total cellular levels of STAT5 were unchanged by insulin treatment and STAT5B levels were reduced to approximately 80% of that measured in untreated, control H4 cells after insulin treatment for 12 or more hours. However, this small reduction of STAT5B was not statistically significant. Previous studies demonstrated that unphosphorylated STAT5B migrates faster on polyacrylamide gels and the migration of tyrosine and/or serine-phosphorylated STAT5B is retarded (38Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 39Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the present studies using rat H4 hepatoma whole cell extracts, and using an antibody specific only to STAT5B, in the absence of GH treatment STAT5B migrated as a doublet of p92/p94 (Fig. 2, top row, lanes 1 and 5) which were previously shown to be specific for unphosphorylated STAT5B (p92) and STAT5B phosphorylated only on serine residues (p94) (38Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 39Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Using the STAT5B-specific antibody, that does not cross-react with STAT5A, bGH treatment (20 min) of rat H4 hepatoma cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5B (PY-STAT5B), as suggested by the retarded mobility of STAT5B (Fig. 2, top row, lanes 2 and 6 versus lanes 1 and 5, respectively). This 95–96-kDa band (p95/p96) is thought to be specific for STAT5B phosphorylated on both serine and tyrosine residues (PY-STAT5B (38Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 39Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)). Thus, when phosphorylated on both tyrosine and serine, STAT5B migrates at approximately the same size as STAT5A (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Insulin pretreatment of H4 cells for 8, 20, and 24 h did not alter the mobility, and therefore the phosphorylation, of STAT5B (Fig. 2, top row, lanes 3, 4, and 7). Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was then measured by using a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody and, consistent with the mobility shift using the STAT5B antibody, bGH-induced the phosphorylation of STAT5 on tyrosine (PY-STAT5; Fig. 2, bottom row, lanes 2 and 6 versus lanes 1 and 5, respectively). Also consistent with the mobility shift using the STAT5B antibody, insulin for 8, 20, and 24 h did not alter the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5B (PY-STAT5; Fig. 2, bottom row, lanes 3, 4, and 7). Thus, continuous insulin treatment at the times studied had little effect on the cellular content or phosphorylation state of STAT5B. Experiments were then designed to examine whether insulin affected GH-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT5B. The ability of bGH for 20 min to induce PY-STAT5B was again observed by the retarded mobility of the STAT5B using the STAT5B isoform-specific antibody (Fig. 3,A and B, lanes 1 versus 2). After insulin pretreatment of H4 cells for 8, 20, or 24 h, there was a reduction of the bGH stimulation of STAT5B retardation. This is most likely due to a smaller fraction of STAT5B being phosphorylated (a smaller fraction migrates at the higher p95/96 PY-STAT5B band) upon bGH addition following insulin pretreatment compared with untreated cells (compare Fig. 3, A, lanes 4 versus 2; and B, lanes 4 versus 2 and 6 versus 2). There was no significant inhibition of bGH-stimulated STAT5B phosphorylation by 4 h of insulin pretreatment, but this inhibition became highly significant between 8 and 24 h of insulin pretreatment (p < 0.001 by ANOVA), with maximum inhibition to approximately 25–30% of control at all times tested between 12 and 24 h (Fig. 3C). Using an antibody specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5, no pretreatment or pretreatment with insulin for 4 h resulted in similar levels of bGH-induced PY-STAT5 (Fig. 4A, top row, lanes 2 and 4). However, following insulin pretreatment for 16, 20, and 24 h, bGH-induced PY-STAT5 was reduced (Fig. 4B, top row, lanes 2 versus 4; and 6 versus 8 and 10). JAK2 protein levels were unaltered at any period of insulin pretreatment when the same Western blots were re-probed with a JAK2-specific antibody (Fig. 4, A, bottom row, lanes 1–4;and B, bottom row, lanes 1–10). When multiple experiments were quantified by densitometry, there was a clear and highly significant reduction (p < 0.001 by ANOVA) in bGH-induced PY-STAT5 by insulin pretreatment using the PY-STAT5-specific antibody at the 8–24-h insulin time points (Fig. 4C). The extent and kinetics of reduction of the bGH stimulation of STAT5 phosphorylation following insulin pretreatment was almost identical when using the PY-STAT5-specific (Fig. 4C) and STAT5B-specific antibody (Fig. 3C). Again, there was no change in JAK2 protein levels at any period of insulin pretreatment when the same Western blots were re-probed with a JAK2-specific antibody (Fig. 4D). From the use of 2 different antibodies measuring the change in mobility of STAT5B and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 directly, we conclude that the effects of insulin are to reduce the ability of GH to stimulate the phosphorylation of STAT5B. Multiple possibilities exist as to the mechanism by which insulin pretreatment could inhibit STAT5B phosphorylation. Since STAT5B is phosphorylated by JAK2, the simplest possibility is that there is a reduction in JAK2 levels or activity. As indicated in Fig. 4, A, B and D, there were no measurable changes in the cellular levels of JAK2 at any time following insulin addition. Thus, the next logical question was whether insulin pretreatment altered GH-induced JAK2 activity. Since phosphorylation of JAK2 on tyrosine is required for its activation and ability to tyrosine phosphorylate STAT5 (9Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N.

Observed K Dvalues for BIO1211 binding ranged from a value of 20–40 nmin the non-activated state of the integrin that exists in 1 mm Mg2+, 1 mm Ca2+ to 100 pm in the activated state seen in 2 mmMn2+ to 18 pm when binding was measured after co-activation by 2 mm Mn2+ plus 10 μg/ml of the integrin-activating monoclonal antibody TS2/16. The large range inK D values was governed almost exclusively by differences in the dissociation rates of the integrin-BIO1211 complex, which ranged from 0.17 × 10−4 s−1 to >140 × 10−4 s−1. Association rate constants varied only slightly under the same conditions, all falling in the narrow range from 0.9 to 2.7 × 106m−1 s−1. The further increase in affinity observed upon co-activation by divalent cations and TS2/16 compared with that observed at saturating concentrations of metal ions or TS2/16 alone indicates that the mechanism by which these factors bring about activation are distinct and identified a previously unrecognized high affinity state on α4β1that had not been detected by conventional assay methods. Similar changes in affinity were observed when the binding properties of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and CS1 to α4β1 were studied, indicating that the different affinity states detected with BIO1211 are an inherent property of the integrin.

Whereas expression of α4β1 is constitutive, its interaction with ligands is strongly enhanced in an activated state that can be induced by various stimuli including antigen, anti-T cell receptor mAbs, phorbol esters, the divalent cation Mn2+, and certain β1-specific antibodies (18Chan B.M.C.

These changes in affinity and/or avidity ultimately determine whether the interaction is productive and stabilizes the ligand-integrin complex or is nonproductive. Although all integrins require divalent cations to bind ligand, the regulation of function by metal binding is complex and is not fully understood (21Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Hu D.D. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol.

This region of the α-chain is made up of seven sequence repeats of about 60 amino acids each, which are presumed to be organized in a β-propeller fold motif found in various enzymes (24Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 25Irie A. Kamata T. Takada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7198-7203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The β-chain contains a second type of metal binding/ligand binding motif that shares homology with the A-domain of von Willebrand's factor (26Corbi A.L. Miller L.J. O'Conner K. Larson R.S.

A homologous structure is present in some α-subunits as well. This 200-residue protein module has proven to be surprisingly tractable for biochemical evaluation, and the corresponding regions from αM, αL, and α2, have been successfully crystallized (28Lee J.-O.

The crystal structures revealed a Mg2+ or Mn2+ bound at the apex of a dinucleotide binding motif (28Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout A. Liddington R.

The observed structure defined by the coordination of the cation with the peptide backbone has been postulated to mimic the ligand-occupied structure in what is commonly referred to as the metal ion-dependent adhesion site or MIDAS (see Refs. 21Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar and 27Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar for references). Whereas the role of cation-binding sites in regulating integrin function is well established, how the sites are coordinated is unclear. Regulation of ligand binding by cations is further complicated by the fact that submillimolar concentrations of Ca2+ can non-competitively inhibit ligand binding, indicating that certain of the metal-binding sites can play an inhibitory role (22Hu D.D. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21745-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Recently, we developed a series of highly selective α4β1 inhibitors using the tetrapeptide ILDV ligand binding sequence from the CS1 region of fibronectin as the starting point for inhibitor design (32Chen L.L. Lobb R.R. Cuervo J.H. Adams S.P. Pepinsky R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8743-8753Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This sequence is homologous to the tetrapeptide QIDS, which comprises the α4β1-binding site in VCAM-1 (33Wang J.-H. Pepinsky B. Stehle T. Liu J.-H. Karpusas M. Browning B. Osborn L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5714-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Whereas both ILDV and QIDS peptides weakly inhibit ligand binding and cell adhesion (33Wang J.-H. Pepinsky B. Stehle T. Liu J.-H. Karpusas M. Browning B. Osborn L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5714-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 34Wayer E.A. Kovach N.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a compound that was 106 times more potent, BIO1211, was generated by substituting isoleucine with a 4-((N′-2-methylphenyl)ureido)-phenylacetyl N-terminal cap (35Lin K.-C. Ateeq H.S. Lee W.-C. Zimmerman C.N. Castro A. Hammond C. Kalkunte S. Chen L.L. Pepinsky R.B. Leone D.R. Sprague A.G. Abraham W.M. Gill A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 42: 920-934Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Here we used a tritiated version of BIO1211 as a probe to assess α4β1 function under various states of activation. The data provide new information on the effect that different activation conditions have on the affinity of α4β1 for its ligands and establish that these differences in affinity are regulated by changes in the dissociation rate of the ligand-integrin complex. [3H]BIO1211 (50 Ci/mmol) was synthesized by NEN Life Science Products using [4,5-3H]leucine as a precursor. The radiochemical purity of the compound was >95% as measured by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column, and the compound yielded the predicted spectrum by 3H NMR. [3H]BIO1211 was dissolved in Me2SO, diluted with 20 volumes of water, and sodium phosphate, pH 8.8, was added to 20 mm (3.66 mCi/ml). The solution was then aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. The binding affinity of the labeled compound was indistinguishable from unlabeled BIO1211 in the α4β1-direct binding assay with VCAM-Ig-alkaline phosphatase as a reporter (36Lobb R.R. Antognetti G. Pepinsky R.B. Burkly L. Leone D. Whitty A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells that had been enriched for α4β1 expression by FACS sorting were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator. K562 cells that had been transfected with either the human α4, human α2, or human α1 gene and selected for high levels of α4β1, α2β1, and α1β1, respectively, by FACS were grown in the same medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418, 10 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. α2 and α4 K562 cells were a gift of Dr. Martin Hemler. For binding studies, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed two times with TBS (50 mm Tris HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmglucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), suspended at approximately 2 × 106 cells/ml in TBS, and counted using a Neubauer hemocytometer. The cells were further diluted with TBS to the concentration indicated and treated with [3H]BIO1211 at room temperature. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 μl of TBS plus Mn2+, and transferred to a scintillation vial containing 2.9 ml of ScintiVerse II (Fisher). Cell-associated radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. All studies were performed in siliconized 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes with a standard 1-ml sample volume. Each condition was tested in at least two independent studies. In the studies indicated, a 100–1000-fold excess of unlabeled BIO1211 was added to samples after the incubation with [3H]BIO1211 to prevent further binding. Binding studies testing the effects of cell number, incubation time, and [3H]BIO1211 concentration were performed in TBS plus 2 mm MnCl2 as described. Nonspecific binding of [3H]BIO1211 to cells was assessed at each cell density and [3H]BIO1211 concentration in TBS but in the absence of added metal ion. Specific counts bound were calculated by subtracting nonspecific counts from total counts bound. Other studies testing the effects of activation on binding were performed as indicated. In the 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mmMg2+ state where K D = 20–40 nm for binding of BIO1211 to α4β1, a high background at the higher BIO1211 concentrations (3,000 cpm at 10 nm) in the standard assay format limited the concentration of [3H]BIO1211 that could be tested to ∼10 nm; however, by diluting the specific activity of the label from 50 to 5 Ci/mmol, binding could be evaluated at BIO1211 concentrations up to 100 nm, albeit with reduced precision. For kinetic on rate measurements, Jurkat cells were treated with 2 nm [3H]BIO1211 at room temperature for the times indicated and then treated with a 500-fold excess of unlabeled BIO1211 to quench further binding by the [3H]BIO1211. Cells were collected by centrifugation and subjected to scintillation counting. For kinetic off rate measurements, Jurkat cells were treated with 5 nm [3H]BIO1211 at room temperature for 1 h. A 500-fold excess of unlabeled BIO1211 was added, and the cells were further incubated for the times indicated. Cells were pelleted at each time point, and cell-associated [3H]BIO1211 was measured by scintillation counting. Binding and dissociation data are represented as a percent of the maximum specific counts bound as a function of time. The data were fitted to an exponential curve by nonlinear regression. Fork off, the exponential rate constant is the off rate. For k on, the observed rate constant is the true rate constant multiplied by the [3H]BIO1211 concentration. The effect of added unlabeled BIO1211 on dissociation rates was tested over a wide range of concentrations from 100 nm (20-fold excess) to 50 μm (10,000-fold excess). The dissociation curves were superimposable over this range of concentrations, indicating that the excess unlabeled ligand was exerting no allosteric effect on the rate of dissociation (data not shown). [3H]BIO1211 was also used to study α4β1 function by competition, using the radioactivity as a reporter for α4β1occupancy. In this format, Jurkat cells (1 × 106/ml) in the buffers indicated were treated with serial dilutions of test compound for 1 h, and then 5 nm[3H]BIO1211, an amount sufficient to bind all unoccupied receptors, was added for 10 min before measuring the bound counts. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and subjected to scintillation counting. Counts bound under these conditions measure integrin that is not occupied by the test compound and is therefore free to bind the [3H]BIO1211. The competition format was also used for kinetic binding studies. Binding and dissociation constants were calculated from α4β1 that after treatment with test compound was free to bind the [3H]BIO1211. Samples were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column (Vydac, catalog number 218TP54, 0.46 × 25 cm) at 23 °C. The column was developed at 1 ml/min with the following gradient of acetonitrile in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5: 0–32 min 17.5–21.5%, 32–45 min 21.5–34.5%, 45–45.1 min 34.5–50%, 45.1–48 min 50%, 48–48.1 min 50–17.5%, and 48.1–53 min 17.5%, conditions that maximize the resolution of BIO1211 from potential proteolytic and hydrolytic degradation products (data not shown). The column effluent was monitored at 254 nm, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The fractions were mixed with scintillation mixture and analyzed by scintillation counting. Immediately prior to injection on the HPLC, test samples were spiked with 2.5 μg each of cold BIO1211 and cold BIO-1588, an analog of BIO1211 with the C-terminal Val-Pro deleted, and a likely proteolysis product. The elution profiles of the cold inhibitors were used to monitor column performance. The ability of [3H]BIO1211 to bind Jurkat (α4β1 positive) cells and α1-transfected K562 (α4β1negative) cells was examined under diverse conditions known to alter the activation state of α4β1 (Fig. 1). [3H]BIO1211 binding to Jurkat cells was greatest in the presence of 2 mmMn2+ alone, 10 mm Mg2+ alone, and 2 mm Mn2+ + 10 μg/ml mAb TS2/16, treatments that activate α4β1. Binding was greatly reduced under non-activating conditions exemplified by treatment with Ca2+, Mg2+ (1 mm each) (see Fig. 1,A and B). No binding was observed to the α1-transfected K562 (α4β1-negative) control cell line. The ∼2000 cpm background seen in Fig. 1A is residual free [3H]BIO1211, which was removed if samples were washed prior to analysis. In the studies presented below, specific binding was calculated by subtracting background counts from total counts bound. Background binding was determined for each test sample using a control sample that was subjected to the same treatment but in the absence of any divalent cation. Specific counts bound at saturation provided a direct measure of α4β1 expression levels, and based on this number, we estimate that the Jurkat cells used in these studies have approximately 80,000 copies of α4β1 per cell. To rule out the possibility that α4β1levels changed under the different treatments, α4β1 levels were compared under the 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+(non-activating), and 2 mm Mn2+ (activating) conditions by FACS, using the non-neutralizing anti-α4mAb B5G10 as a reporter (Fig. 1C). The α4β1 levels in the activated and non-activated samples were indistinguishable. A series of studies were performed to assess selected variables that might affect the performance of the assay. First, no impact of temperature on BIO1211 binding was observed under any of the activating conditions tested when binding was compared at room temperature and at 37 °C (data not shown). Second, the presence of human serum or plasma at concentrations up to ≅100% of the total assay volume had no effect on the binding assay (data not shown). Third, bound [3H]BIO1211 could be quantitatively released from Jurkat cells with EDTA, indicating that the BIO1211·α4β1 complex remained on the cell surface. The released BIO1211 was further characterized by reverse phase HPLC for the presence of potential degradation products that might impact our interpretation of binding. As shown in Fig. 2, over 95% of the bound [3H]BIO1211 was released by the EDTA treatment unchanged, indicating that only minimal degradation had occurred. Previously, we showed that the kinetically determined K D values for binding of [3H]BIO1211 to Mn2+-activated cells of various types (peripheral blood lymphocytes, ∼10,000 copies of α4β1/cell; Jurkat cells, ∼80,000 copies/cell; α4-K562 cells ∼250,000 copies/cell) were similar, showing that BIO1211 binding was not affected by differences in surface expression of α4β1 (35Lin K.-C. Ateeq H.S. Lee W.-C. Zimmerman C.N. Castro A. Hammond C. Kalkunte S. Chen L.L. Pepinsky R.B. Leone D.R. Sprague A.G. Abraham W.M. Gill A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 42: 920-934Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Finally, because of the presence of two carboxylic acid groups in the BIO1211 sequence, we tested whether it could function as a chelator. Using fluorescent metal ion indicators that are sensitive to the concentrations of free Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ as probes for binding, we were unable to detect an association between BIO1211 and these metal ions (data not shown). The low level of occupancy seen in Fig. 1B, for binding of [3H]BIO1211 to Jurkat cells under non-activating conditions, suggested that the affinity of BIO1211 for α4β1 was lower for non-activated than for the activated integrin. In order to confirm this possibility and to obtain a more accurate measure of K D, the analysis was repeated using higher BIO1211 concentrations. The resulting curves showed dose-dependent binding and, at 100 nm[3H]BIO1211, specific counts bound were comparable for the 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mmMg2+ state and the 2 mm Mn2+ state (data not shown). Based on these binding data, a K Dof 20–40 nm was calculated for the 1 mmCa2+, 1 mm Mg2+ (non-activated) state. Attempts to estimate K D values for activated states using equilibrium binding methods were unsuccessful because theK D values were lower than the concentration of α4β1 in the assay. Thus, while we observed dose-dependent and saturable binding (see Fig. 1B), the binding curves were in fact simply measuring a titration of the receptor to full occupancy and could not be used to accurately calculate affinity. A more accurate assessment of the affinity of BIO1211 for activated α4β1 was obtained using kinetic measurements (see below). For unknown reasons, total counts bound were 20% lower in the 1 mmCa2+, 1 mm Mg2+ + TS2/16 state under conditions that should have been saturating for [3H]BIO1211 binding compared with other activated states (Fig. 1B). It was not possible to perform FACS analysis in the presence of TS2/16 to test if TS2/16 treatment had altered surface levels of integrin, since the analysis would have required co-treatment with two murine anti-α4β1 mAbs. Kinetic data for the binding and dissociation of [3H]BIO1211 to α4β1 were measured under the following conditions, as shown in Fig. 3: 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+; Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ (1 mmeach); 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mmMg2+ + 10 μg/ml TS2/16; 2 mmMn2+; and 2 mm Mn2+ + 10 μg/ml TS2/16. Binding reached a plateau level within 10 min of treatment for all test conditions (Fig. 3A). Association rate constants (k on) calculated from these time courses all fell in the narrow range from 0.9 to 2.7 × 106m−1 s−1 (TableI). Differences in the percent α4β1 occupied after 10 min were identical to those seen in the equilibrium experiments shown in Fig. 1B. Time courses for the rates of dissociation of BIO1211 from Jurkat cells are shown in Fig. 3B. Unlike the association rates, which were similar across the different assay conditions, the dissociation rates varied over a wide range and were highly dependent on the activation state of the integrin. Values fork off ranged from 0.17 × 10−4s−1 for the 2 mm Mn2+ + TS2/16 state to >140 × 10−4 s−1 for the 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+state (Table I). The kinetic rate constants from these and other binding studies were used to calculate K D values, which are summarized in Table I. The close correspondence between the variations in K D values and in dissociation rates indicates that the affinity of BIO1211 for α4β1 is governed almost exclusively by off rates. K D values observed under conditions commonly considered to be activating ranged from 470 pm in the Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ (1 mmeach) state to 18 pm in the 2 mmMn2+ + TS2/16 state. These differences in affinity that resulted from activation were not apparent from the equilibrium binding measurements because the K D values were lower than the concentration of α4β1 in the assays and therefore were masked by the format of the assay. Similar problems were encountered when affinities were estimated by measuring the ability of BIO1211 to block cell adhesion to CS1 or VCAM or to block direct binding of VCAM-Ig to Jurkat cells with VCAM-Ig as the reporter (data not shown).Table IBinding of [3H]BIO1211 to α4β1 on Jurkat cells under various states of activationBufferkon/106koff/10−4KDm−1s−1s−1pm1 mm Ca2+, 1 mmMg2+2.7>140>5000aA value of 20–40 nm was determined using equilibrium binding data (see text).2 mm Mg2+1.28.3700Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ (1 mmeach)1.15.247010 mmMg2+1.25.344050 mmMg2+1.24.3360100 mmMg2+1.23.22201 mmCa2+, 1 mm Mg2+ + TS2/162.35.1270bData shown were derived from the experiment shown in Fig. 3.koff is better defined by a double exponential fit as described in the text.300 mmMg2+1.22.11702 mmMn2+1.31.41002 mmMn2+ + HP1/21.31.31002 mmMn2+ + TS2/160.90.171810 mm Mg2+ + TS2/161.00.4040On rates, off rates, and KD values for the binding of [3H]BIO1211 to α4β1 were determined from kinetic measurements as described in the legend to Fig. 3. mAbs TS2/16 and HP1/2 were used at 10 μg/ml.

On rates for the Mg2+states were determined at 1, 10, and 100 mm Mg2+and were indistinguishable. The value measured at those concentrations has been assigned to the other Mg2+ alone states shown. To understand better the role metal ions have on activation, we performed the study shown in Fig. 4, where binding was tested as a function of changing Mg2+concentrations. The dissociation rates were highly dependent on the Mg2+ concentration and changed from 8.3 × 10−4 s−1 to 5.3 × 10−4s−1 to 4.3 × 10−4 s−1 to 3.2 × 10−4 s−1 to 2.1 × 10−4 s−1 when dissociation rates were measured in the presence of 2, 10, 50, 100, and 300 mmMg2+. When K D was plotted as a function of Mg2+ concentration, the data fit a hyperbolic curve, suggesting that the measurements were part of a continuum rather than discrete points (Fig. 4B). At high concentrations of added Mg2+, binding appears to be saturating out at an affinity that approximates the value seen at 2 mm Mn2+(Fig. 4B). Suboptimal concentrations of Mn2+produced a similar titration of the dissociation rate to that seen with Mg2+, although at a much lower concentration of the metal ion (data not shown). Variations in the concentration of TS2/16 from 0.1 to 10 μg/ml had no effect on K D (data not shown), indicating that 10 μg/ml was a saturating concentration. While the maximal affinity for binding of BIO1211 to α4β1 in the presence of divalent cations was achieved with 2 mm Mn2+, a further increase in affinity was observed if samples were co-activated with 2 mm Mn2+ + TS2/16, suggesting that the mechanisms by which TS2/16 and divalent cations brought about activation were distinct. Results from these analyses are summarized in Table I. In the presence of 2 mm Mn2+ alone and 2 mm Mn2+ + TS2/16, K Dvalues of 100 and 18 pm, respectively, were observed. TheK D value resulting from activation by TS2/16 alone (i.e."

The kinetic properties of the purified fragment, CCTα236, were characterized, as well as the effects of expressing the fragment in cultured cells. CCTα236 was truncated after residue 236, which corresponds to the end of the highly conserved catalytic domain. The activity of purified CCTα236 was independent of lipids and about 50-fold higher than the activity of wild-type CCTα assayed in the absence of lipids, supporting a model in which the membrane-binding segment functions as an inhibitor of the catalytic domain. Thek cat/K m values for CCTα236 were only slightly lower than those for lipid-activated CCTα. The importance of the membrane-binding segment in vivo was tested by expression of CCTα236 in CHO58 cells, a cell line that is temperature-sensitive for growth and CCTα activity. Expression of wild-type CCTα in these cells complemented the defective growth phenotype when the cells were cultured in complete or delipidated fetal bovine serum. Expression of CCTα236, however, did not complement the growth phenotype in the absence of serum lipids. These cells were capable of making phosphatidylcholine in the delipidated medium, so the inability of the cells to grow was not due to defective phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Supplementation of the delipidated medium with an unsaturated fatty acid allowed growth of CHO58 cells expressing CCTα236. These results indicate that the membrane-binding segment of CCTα has an important role in cellular lipid metabolism.

CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) 1The abbreviation used is: CCT, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; PC, phosphatidylcholine; FBS, fetal bovine serum; M/L, membrane/lipid; GCT, CTP:glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase. is a critical participant in the CDP-choline pathway, catalyzing the synthesis of CDP-choline for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major component of eukaryotic cell membranes (1Cornell R.B. Adv. Lipobiol. 1996; 1A: 1-38Google Scholar, 2Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CCT is rate-limiting for the CDP-choline pathway and is extensively regulated at the enzymatic level. Mammalian CCT is present as both soluble and membrane-associated forms. Activation of CCT often occurs simultaneously with the translocation of the enzyme from a soluble form to membrane-associated form, resulting in an increase in the rate of PC synthesis. Consistent with in vivo membrane activation, the soluble form of CCT is activated by the addition of certain lipids in vitro. There are two isoforms of mammalian CCT; the most extensively studied, CCTα, is nuclear and apparently ubiquitously expressed (2Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The recently discovered CCTβ is cytoplasmic and exhibits tissue-specific expression (3Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mammalian CCTα contains several functional regions: an N-terminal nuclear localization signal, a central catalytic domain, a membrane/lipid (M/L) activation segment, and a C-terminal phosphorylation region (see Fig. 1). There is a high degree of sequence similarity within the catalytic domain of all known forms of CCT, with the yeast catalytic domain being 56% identical to that of mammalian CCTα, and the catalytic domains of CCTα and CCTβ being 90% identical. By contrast, there is much less conservation of primary structure in the N-terminal sequence or the C-terminal M/L and phosphorylation regions. Truncated forms of rat CCTα have been constructed to determine the regions responsible for lipid activation. Both full-length CCTα and truncated forms lacking the phosphorylation segment require lipids for full activity (4Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Truncations lacking the M/L region, however, are not lipid-activated (4Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Yang W.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is notable that CHO58 cells that are temperature-sensitive for growth and CCTα activity can be complemented by exogenous expression of the truncated CCTα lacking the M/L region, which suggested that this segment is not important for growth under normal cell culture conditions (5Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These studies have contributed to the general understanding that the M/L region is truly responsible for membrane binding in the cell and lipid activation in vitro. On the other hand, two important questions regarding the M/L segment remain. First, what is the mechanism by which the M/L segment controls the activation of the enzyme by lipids? Second, what is the importance of the M/L segmentin vivo? The answer to the first question depends on an understanding of the level of activity remaining in the truncated enzyme lacking the M/L region, which has been a matter of some debate. The truncation expressed by Wang and Kent (5Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), CCTα236 (Fig. 1), is constitutively active as assessed by measuring enzyme activity in crude extracts and enzyme levels by quantitative immunoblotting. Slightly different forms expressed by Yanget al. (6Yang W. Boggs K.P. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23951-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or Cornell et al. (4Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) are less than 10% as active as full-length, lipid-activated CCTα (7Feldman D.A. Weinhold P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9075-9081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the precise role of the M/L segment in enzyme activation is not clear. Wang and Kent (5Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) proposed that the M/L segment interacts with the catalytic domain to cause inhibition and that removal of the M/L segment by lipid binding results in activation of catalysis. Jackowski and co-workers (6Yang W. Boggs K.P. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23951-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), however, proposed that lipids and the M/L domain are co-activators of the catalytic domain. In this paper we report the kinetic properties of purified CCTα236, showing that it is nearly as active as full-length CCTα and is indeed lipid-independent, supporting the model that the M/L segment is inhibitory. In addition, we report conditions under which the presence of the M/L segment in CCTα is necessary for cell growth. CTP, phosphocholine, protease inhibitors, lipids, CM-Sepharose, DEAE-Sepharose, and Sephacryl S-200-HR were obtained from Sigma. The cross-linkers, BS3 and Sulfo-MBS, were from Pierce. [3H]choline and [14C]phosphocholine were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system, Sf9 cells adapted for serum-free growth, Sf900II serum-free medium, and Ham's F-10 and F-12 media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs. Fetal bovine serum was from BioWhittaker. Blue-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A cDNA encoding rat liver CCTα (8MacDonald J.I. Kent C. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was placed in the baculovirus donor plasmid pFASTBAC1 using the BamHI and SphI sites of the multiple cloning site. To generate a cDNA encoding truncation mutant CCTα236 with appropriate restriction sites for the vector, oligonucleotide-directed polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis was used to introduce a stop codon following amino acid 236. The following oligonucleotides were utilized: 5′-oligo, 5′-CGCGGATCCAGATCTATGGATGCACAGAGTTCA-3′, and 3′-oligo, 5′-ACATGCATGCGGTACCTTAGTTGATAAAGCTGACATT-3′. Stocks of virus encoding wild-type CCTα and CCTα236 were prepared as described in the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system instruction manual. For protein production, 1-liter cultures of Sf9 cells at 1 × 106 cells/ml were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2. Cells were harvested at 48 h post-infection for protein purification. Sf9 cells expressing wild-type CCTα were collected, lysed, and centrifuged as described (8MacDonald J.I. Kent C. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 100,000 × g Sf9 cell supernatant was loaded directly onto a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 150 mmNaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40 followed by 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The enzyme was eluted from the column with a 150–400 mm NaCl gradient in buffer A. The fractions constituting the peak of CCTα activity were pooled, diluted 5-fold in buffer A, and loaded onto a CM-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 30 mm NaCl. The enzyme was eluted from the column with a gradient of NaCl from 30 to 150 mm, and the fractions containing the peak of the CCTα activity were pooled. The high speed Sf9 cell supernatant was loaded onto a CM-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed sequentially with 10 column volumes each of buffer A and buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. CCTα236 was eluted from the CM-Sepharose column with buffer A containing 0.2 mNaCl. The CM-Sepharose elution fraction was loaded onto a Blue-Sepharose 6 fast flow column. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl. CCTα236 was eluted from Blue-Sepharose with buffer A containing 0.5 mNaCl. Activity of purified enzymes was determined with a charcoal binding assay as described previously (9Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17843-17849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The kinetic parametersk cat and K m with respect to substrates CTP and phosphocholine were determined from secondary plots. Kinetic parameters were determined in the presence and absence of PC:oleate vesicles (10Weinhold P.A. Feldman D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); the final concentration of each lipid was 100 μm. CHO58 cells expressing full-length CCTα or CCTα236 were obtained previously (5Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cell stocks were maintained at 34 °C in 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES and10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The stably transfected cell lines were maintained in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 during one-third of the passages. For growth curves, cells were plated at 34 °C in Ham's F-12, 10% FBS at 50,000 cells/35-mm dish or 50,000 cells/well of a 6-well plate. After 24 h the medium was removed, cells were washed twice in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, and then F-10 medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and either 10% FBS or 10% delipidated serum was added. The cells were then maintained at 37 °C, and viable cell density was determined after trypsinization by counting in trypan blue with a hemocytometer. Lipids were diluted into the medium from a 1000× stock in ethanol. For the choline uptake experiment, cells were plated at 250,000 cells/60-mm dish in Ham's F-10, 10% FBS, and the medium changed as for growth curves. Fetal bovine serum was delipidated by extraction with isopropyl ether and n-butanol as described (11Chin J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6304-6310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then sterilized by filtration. The protocol used is a modification of that described previously (5Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 24 h after plating, cells were washed twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and shifted into Ham's F-10, 25 mm HEPES, 10% delipidated serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Cells were then grown for another 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were labeled by incubating at 37 °C in 1.5 ml of medium supplemented with 2 μCi/ml [3H]choline for the indicated times. Cells were harvested by washing three times in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and scraping into 1.0 ml of water at 0 °C. Total lipids were extracted from 0.8 ml of the extract as described previously (12Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the assay of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) or Lowry et al. (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because we were interested in lipid activation of CCTα, we devised a new purification procedure for CCTα that does not include treatment with lipids, as did the classical procedure (7Feldman D.A. Weinhold P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9075-9081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The new procedure involves ion exchange chromatography on both DEAE-Sepharose and CM-Sepharose at pH 7.5. Apparently the distribution of charged residues in the enzyme is suitable to allow it to bind to both resins at pH 7.5, unlike most other proteins. The baculovirus-expressed enzyme that was purified by this procedure appeared homogeneous by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS gels (Fig. 2A). The specific activity of the purified enzyme was similar to the activity of the enzyme purified by the classical procedure (7Feldman D.A. Weinhold P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9075-9081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8MacDonald J.I. Kent C.

The enzyme was homogeneous as assessed by SDS gels (Fig. 2B). CCTα236 did not bind to DEAE-Sepharose at pH 7.5, suggesting that the C-terminal regulatory segments in CCTα are negatively charged at that pH and mediate interaction with the anion exchange support. The ability of the purified forms of CCTα to be activated by lipids was determined by assaying in the presence and absence of vesicles of PC:oleate, 1:1 (10Weinhold P.A. Feldman D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The activity of wild-type CCTα, purified in the absence of lipids, is very responsive to the addition of lipid (Fig. 3). Over the range of 0–20 μm lipid, CCTα is activated approximately 50-fold. In contrast, the activity of CCTα236 was not affected by the addition of lipid; the specific activity of CCTα236 with and without lipid was comparable with lipid-activated wild-type CCTα (Fig. 3). The kinetic parameters of purified wild-type CCTα and CCTα236 were measured in the presence and absence of 100 μm PC:oleate (1:1), a concentration at which CCTα is maximally active. Thek cat value for wild-type CCTα in the absence of lipid was 86-fold less than that for wild-type CCTα with 100 μm lipid (Table II). Thek cat values for CCTα236 were independent of the presence of lipid and were only about 30% lower than that for wild-type CCTα in the presence of lipid. The K mvalues for phosphocholine were similar for both enzyme forms in the presence and absence of lipids. The K m values for CTP were somewhat higher for CCTα236 than for wild-type CCTα. The catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) values, therefore, for CCTα236 in the absence of lipid were 30–50% as high as those for wild-type CCTα in the presence of lipids. In contrast, thek cat/K m values for CCTα236 were 30–70-fold higher than those for wild-type CCTα in the absence of lipids (Table II). The fact that the activity of CCTα236 is so much greater than the activity of wild-type CCTα in the absence of lipids supports the model in which the M/L region is inhibitory to catalysis.Table IIKinetic parameters of CCTα and CCTα236EnzymeLipidk catK mk cat/K mPoCCTPPoCCTPs−1mmmm−1s−1CCTα+17.7 ± 2.90.65 ± 0.271.29 ± 0.3027.213.7−0.21 ± 0.031.05 ± 0.131.69 ± 0.270.200.12CCTα236+11.1 ± 1.70.97 ± 0.054.47 ± 0.6611.42.48−12.6 ± 1.90.90 ± 0.083.15 ± 0.2514.04.00Values for k cat and K m are the averages ± S.D. for three independent determinations.

Wild-type CCTα is known to be a homodimer (15Weinhold P.A. Rounsifer M.E. Charles L. Feldman D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Cornell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9077-9082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the residues interacting at the dimer interface have not been determined. If the M/L region were important in determining the oligomerization state of CCTα, then CCTα236 might be expected to be monomeric. The quaternary structure of CCTα236 was therefore assessed by intermolecular cross-linking using the bifunctional cross-linkers BS3 and sulfo-MBS. BS3 is specific for cross-linking two amine-containing functional groups, whereas sulfo-MBS targets an amine and sulfhydryl. Both wild-type CCTα and CCTα236 were cross-linked by BS3 and sulfo-MBS (Fig. 4). The major cross-linked form for both species appeared to be dimeric. Wild-type CCTα also appeared to form high molecular weight species, whereas CCTα236 formed only the cross-linked dimer. The quaternary structure of CCTα236 was also investigated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200-HR. The truncated enzyme eluted between the protein standards bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin. The calculated molecular weight was 50,300, and the expected molecular weight of a dimer of CCTα236 is 53,500. Thus, both cross-linking and gel filtration indicated that CCTα236 is a homodimer and support the concept that the dimerization interface of CCTα involves residues in the catalytic domain and not the C-terminal regulatory domains. Although it is clear that the M/L region of CCTα has a profound effect on enzyme activity, the function of this domain in the cell remains open to question. Expression of CCTα236 in the CHO58 cell line, which is temperature-sensitive for growth and CCTα activity (17Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-7393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fully complements the temperature-sensitive growth defect (5Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that the M/L region is not required for routine lipid metabolism and cell cycling. However, we have more recently discovered conditions under which expression of CCTα236 is not sufficient to complement the CHO58 defect. When CHO58 cells stably transfected with CCTα236 were transferred to medium containing delipidated serum, the cells could not continue to grow at 40 °C (data not shown). Furthermore, these cells could not grow in delipidated serum at 37 °C, a temperature that is permissive for the growth of untransfected CHO58 in either complete serum or delipidated serum (Fig. 5). Thus the inability of cells expressing CCTα236 to grow in delipidated medium is a dominant negative effect. CHO58 cells expressing wild-type CCTα were capable of growth at 37 °C in either complete or delipidated serum (Fig. 5). To determine whether a single specific lipid would restore the ability of CHO58 cells expressing CCTα236 to grow, a number of different lipids were added to the delipidated medium. The unsaturated fatty acid oleate was capable of supporting growth at the same rate as in complete serum (Fig. 6). Optimal growth was seen at oleate concentrations from 40 to 100 μm oleate. Other unsaturated fatty acids, linoleate and palmitoleate, could also fully support growth at 40 μm (not shown). The saturated fatty acids myristate, palmitate, and stearate at 40 μm could not support growth. The combination of 20 μm cholesterol plus 200 μm mevalonate could not support growth, and the addition of cholesterol and mevalonate to the oleate-containing medium did not enhance growth further than oleate alone. These results indicate that expression of CCTα236 had transformed CHO58 cells into unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs. We had observed previously that CHO58 cells expressing CCTα236 in complete serum were considerably more active at making PC than cells expressing wild-type CCTα (5Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the CCTα236 being constitutively active. To discover whether the ability of these cells to make PC was defective in delipidated serum, rates of choline incorporation into PC were measured 24 h after transfer to delipidated medium, a time at which the cells were still viable as determined by trypan blue exclusion. As indicated in Fig. 7, CCTα236/58 cells were fully capable of making PC in delipidated serum. The rate of PC synthesis was higher by a factor of 1.7 ± 0.6 (n = 5) in cells expressing CCTα236 than in cells expressing wild-type CCTα, as had been observed when these cells were grown in complete serum. The higher rate of PC synthesis in cells expressing CCTα236 is consistent with the M/L domain being inhibitory in the cell. Two distinct models can be envisioned for the role of lipid binding in regulating catalysis by CCTα (Fig. 8). In model A, the M/L region interacts with the catalytic domain in the absence of lipids, and this interaction inhibits enzyme activity. Binding of lipids to the M/L segment causes it to dissociate from the catalytic domain, and the inhibition is relieved. In model B, the catalytic domain in the inactive enzyme does not associate with the M/L region. When the M/L region becomes complexed with lipids it then associates with the catalytic domain to activate catalysis. Both models predict that CCTα236 would have lipid-independent activity. Model A, however, predicts that CCTα236 would be as active as the wild-type enzyme in the presence of lipids, whereas model B predicts that CCTα236 would be as inactive as the wild-type enzyme in the absence of lipids. The results in this manuscript show that the activity of CCTα236 is indeed independent of lipids. Moreover, CCTα236 is nearly as active as full-length CCTα in the presence of lipids and much more active than full-length CCTα in the absence of lipids. The presence of the regulatory regions in the absence of lipid lowers the maximal velocity attainable by CCTα about 50-fold. These data clearly support model A, in which the M/L region acts as an inhibitor in the absence of lipids. Other truncated forms of rat CCTα have been expressed with considerably lower activity than CCTα236. Two of these, CCTα228 (4Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and CCTα230 (6Yang W. Boggs K.P. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23951-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were missing several residues that are highly conserved in all CCTs from yeasts to mammals (2Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It is possible that these residues are important for catalysis or for enzyme structure. In addition both these truncations contained additional amino acids at their C termini, which may have adversely affected activity. CCTα256 also had low activity (6Yang W. Boggs K.P. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23951-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which presents the interesting possibility that residues 237–256 contain part of the inhibitory region of the M/L region. We originally chose to end our truncation at 236 based on sequence conservation (5Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but later analysis of the mouse CCTα gene indicated that a splice junction terminates the last exon of the catalytic domain at this site (18Tang W. Keesler G.A. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13146-13151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This suggests that the catalytic domain does truly end at residue 236. The role of lipid in the activation of CCTα has been reported to be due to both a lowering of the K m for CTP as well as an increase in V max (6Yang W. Boggs K.P. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23951-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our analysis of kinetic parameters of wild-type CCTα revealed only an increase ink cat in the presence of lipids, with no substantial decrease in K m for CTP (Table II). It is not yet clear why there is a discrepancy in these K mdeterminations. It should be remembered that the kinetic constantK m is a complex term of rate constants that is rarely a simple reflection of substrate binding affinity (19Kyte J. Mechanism in Protein Chemistry. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1995: 149-189Google Scholar). It has been argued that the effect of an activator or inhibitor onK m is not as useful as a determination as the effect on V max/K m ork cat/K m (20Plesner I.W. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the V max/K mvalues for CCTα ± lipids vary by a factor of 220 in the studies of Yang et al. (6Yang W. Boggs K.P. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23951-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and thek cat/K m values for CCTα ± lipids in the present study differed by a factor of 114. That these values are quite similar supports the argument that the ratio of catalytic constant to K m rather thanK m itself is the appropriate constant for comparing the effects of lipids on activity. Results obtained by cross-linking (Fig. 4) and gel filtration indicate that CCTα236 is a dimer. This would indicate that the residues responsible for dimer formation in wild-type CCTα are largely within the catalytic domain or the N terminus. CTP:glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (GCT), a small enzyme similar in primary sequence to the catalytic domain of CCT, is also a homodimer (21Park Y.S. Sweitzer T.D. Dixon J.E. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16648-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the concept that residues in the catalytic domain are sufficient for dimer formation. We have recently completed the crystal structure of GCT. 2C. H. Weber, Y. S. Park, S. Sanker, C. Kent, and M. Ludwig, submitted for publication. The majority of residues at the dimer interface of GCT are similar or identical to the corresponding residues in CCTα, suggesting that the interface within the catalytic domain is a conserved feature of this cytidylyltransferase family. A role for the M/L or phosphorylation regions in modulating a monomer-dimer equilibrium cannot be ruled out but does not seem likely. Determining the role of the M/L region in vitro should aid in our understanding of the function of this enzyme in the cell. It was disappointing, therefore, that previous expression results had indicated that the regulatory regions of CCTα are not needed by cells, at least under the usual cell culture conditions (5Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The present results indicate, however, that the presence of the M/L region can be critical under certain conditions. Expression of CCTα236 in CHO58 cells maintained in delipidated serum was toxic unless the cells were supplied with an unsaturated fatty acid. The toxicity was a dominant effect in that it occurred even at a temperature permissive for growth of untransfected CHO58 cells. The toxicity was not due to an inability of the cells to make PC under these conditions (Fig. 7). Although we do not yet know the reason for the requirement for an unsaturated fatty acid, two possibilities come to mind. One is simply that the cells are making so much more PC that the desaturase responsible for making unsaturated fatty acids cannot keep up with the demand, with the result that too much saturated phospholipid is made and put into membranes. The other possibility is that CCTα is somehow involved in the induction of the desaturase in lipid-free medium, and the M/L region plays a role in that induction. The latter possibility would mean that CCTα has a role in coordinating lipid biosynthesis, which might explain its puzzling nuclear location. The demonstration of a role for the M/L region in lipid-free medium has afforded an experimental system in which that role can be elucidated. We thank Patricia Gee for cell culture media, T. Y. Chang for assistance with serum delipidation, and Paul Weinhold, Douglas Feldman, Joel Clement, and Subramaniam Sanker for helpful discussions."

J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 2173-2192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is anchored to the surface of capillary endothelium, hydrolyzes chylomicron TG into free fatty acids (FFA) that are targeted to the underlying muscles and adipose tissue. The residues of chylomicrons are then released from the endothelium and taken up by the liver. Both the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) contribute to this process (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar, 3Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Studies using anti-LDL receptor antibodies or mice with a deficiency of the apoE gene suggest that the LDL receptor accounts for up to half of the clearance of chylomicrons (4De Aria E. Fong L.G. Komaromy M. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ishibashi S. Perrey S. Chen Z. Osuga J. Shimada M. Ohashi K. Harada K. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22422-22427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, human subjects deficient for the LDL receptor clear chylomicron remnants normally (6Rubinsztein D.C. Cohen J.C. Berger G.M. Van der Westhuyzen D.R. Coetzee G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, mice with CRE-loxP-mediated selective disruption of the LRP gene in the liver are not hyperlipidemic (7Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). If LRP-deficient mice are cross-bred with LDL receptor-deficient mice, apoB48, the main chylomicron apolipoprotein, accumulates in the plasma (7Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), but plasma TG concentrations in these mice are not dramatically increased. This is in contrast with the effect of the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein, a known inhibitor of LRP activity, which induces a massive increase of plasma TG and cholesterol when overexpressed in mice (8Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).We have reported the characterization of a lipoprotein receptor that is inhibited by receptor-associated protein at concentrations similar to those achieved in the receptor-associated protein overexpression study (9Troussard A.A.

This receptor was originally identified by its binding of LDL in the presence of FFA and is hereafter referred to as the lipolysis-stimulated receptor (LSR). LSR binds apoB and apoE, displays the greatest affinity for TG-rich lipoprotein (chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)), and does not bind β-VLDL isolated from subjects with type III hyperlipidemia (10Yen F.T. Mann C.J. Guermani L.M. Hannouche N.F. Hubert N. Hornick C.A Bordeau V.N. Agnani G. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Bihain B.E. Yen F.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4628-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several characteristics of LSR suggest that it represents an important step for the clearance of chylomicrons. Indeed, LSR is expressed in the liver, and its activity is markedly increased in endocytic vesicles (10Yen F.T. Mann C.J. Guermani L.M. Hannouche N.F. Hubert N. Hornick C.A Bordeau V.N. Agnani G. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). LSR is inhibited by lactoferrin, a milk protein that, when injected intravenously, inhibits the uptake of chylomicrons by the liver (10Yen F.T. Mann C.J. Guermani L.M. Hannouche N.F. Hubert N.

Biochem. 1988; 21: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Also, apoCIII inhibits the binding of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein chylomicrons and VLDL but not that of LDL to LSR (14Mann C.J. Troussard A.A. Yen F.T. Hannouche N. Najib J. Fruchart J.-C. Lotteau V. André P. Bihain B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31348-31354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), while apoCIII overexpression in mice induces profound hypertriglyceridemic effects (15Ito Y. Azrolan N. O'Connell A. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Science. 1990; 249: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Finally, in rats, the apparent numbers of LSR expressed at the surface of hepatocytes correlate strongly and negatively with plasma TG levels measured in the postprandial stage (12Mann C.J. Khallou J. Chevreuil O. Troussard A.A. Guermani L.M. Launay K. Delplanque B. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10421-10431Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The limitations of this model are 2-fold. First, maximal activation of the receptor requires FFA at concentrations that exceed albumin-binding capacity. It is our hypothesis, as yet unproven that large amounts of FFA are released by hepatic lipase acting upon chylomicrons and VLDL directly in the environment that bathes the receptors (16Bihain B.E. Yen F.T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Second, the molecular characterization of the receptor remained incomplete and relied entirely on the identification of candidate proteins by ligand blotting in the presence of oleate (10Yen F.T.

The PCR 5′ primer introduced an initiation codon after the signal sequence, which was deleted, and a sequence coding a hexahistidine tag. The modified mouse leptin coding sequence was cloned into the pSE280 expression vector (Invitrogen, France) and expressed in E. coli (TG1). DNA sequencing of the plasmid confirmed the sequence of the coding open reading frame. Cells were grown at 37 °C, and the protein synthesis was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were collected by low speed centrifugation and lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycle and deoxyribonuclease I digestion.

When exposed to ionizing radiation, the increase in levels of p53 was the same as in normal mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, the rise in p21WAF1/cip1 and mdm2 was found to be delayed and attenuated, which correlated in time with delayed onset of G1/S arrest by flow cytometric analysis. The p53-dependent G1 checkpoint was not eliminated: inactivation of p53 by the E6 protein in scid cells resulted in the complete loss of detectable G1/S arrest after DNA damage. Immunofluorescence analysis of normal cells revealed p53 to be localized predominantly within the cytoplasm prior to irradiation and then translocate to the nucleus after irradiation. In contrast,scid cells show abnormal accumulation of p53 in the nucleus independent of irradiation, which was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of nuclear lysates. Taken together, these data suggest that loss of DNA-PK activity appears to attenuate the kinetics of p53 to activate downstream genes, implying that DNA-PK plays a role in post-translational modification of p53, without affecting the increase in levels of p53 in response to DNA damage. scid mouse embryonic fibroblasts are deficient in DNA-dependent protein kinase activity due to a mutation in the C-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs).

The tumor suppressor protein, p53, plays a critical role in the cellular response to genotoxic stress.

Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). Co-incident with the increase in the levels of p53 is the activation of p53-dependent transcription for a variety of genes, including p21WAF1/cip1, GADD45 and MDM2, resulting in either G1/S cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (2Harper J.W.

The mechanism by which the signal of DNA damage is transduced to p53 remains to be defined. Initially, it had been presumed that the effect of the signal from DNA damage was to increase the amount of p53 protein in the cell, which could then signal other genes in the damage response pathway (6Kastan M.B. Kuerbitz S.J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1993; 101: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that p53-dependent transactivation can occur in the absence of any increase in the level of p53 (7Isaacs J.S. Chiao C. Merrick B.A. Selkirk J.K. Barrett J.C. Weissman B.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2986-2992PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Haapajarvi et al. (8Haapajarvi T. Pitkanen K. Tsubari M. Laiho M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3074-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the effect of ultraviolet light exposure on cells synchronized in G1 was to increase transcriptional activity of p53 and subsequently G1 arrest, well before any demonstrated increase in the levels of p53 protein. Furthermore, the accumulation of p53 only occurred when the cells had progressed into S-phase of the cell cycle. Thus, it seems likely that the signal from DNA damage can affect both the levels of p53 and the active state of p53 (post-translational modification). These two responses from DNA damage to p53 could share a common signaling pathway or utilize different pathways, as there has been no genetic basis to separate them to date. Most recently, the use of protein kinase C inhibitors resulted in increased levels of p53 (secondary to an increase in its half-life) and consequent translocation to the nucleus. However, DNA damage was still needed to increase the activity of p53, as measured by a β-galactosidase transactivation reporter assay (9Chernov M.V. Ramana C.V. Adler V.V. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2284-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The timing of the response to DNA damage does not provide a definitive answer to discriminate between post-translational modification and elevated levels of p53. The levels of p53 are seen to rise by 1–2 h after exposure to IR and reach a peak between 2 and 6 h, depending on the cell type tested. The levels of MDM2 are found to increase within 2–4 h of IR (10Chen C.Y. Oliner J.D. Zhan Q. Fornace Jr., A.J. Vogelstein B. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The fact that downstream genes are transcriptionally activated and the resultant protein detected by 2 h suggests that the rapid response to p53 is mediated by a post-translational modification of p53 or modification of an inhibitory protein such as MDM2, which occurs more rapidly than a rise in the level of p53. The DNA-activated (or dependent) protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated in vitroby DNA fragments (12Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 13Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell.

Several observations have suggested that a large polypeptide (initially reported to be 350 kDa, but now thought to be approximately 460 kDa (14Jackson S.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)) is the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK, while a cellular DNA end-binding protein, the Ku autoantigen (consisting of 70- and 80–86-kDa proteins), serves as the regulatory subunit (13Lees-Miller S.P.

DNA-PK has been shown to phosphorylate several nuclear DNA-binding proteins in vitro, including the transactivation domain of p53 (17Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Recently, these observations were expanded to show the importance of serines 15 and 37 in mediating the response to DNA damage in vivo, and showing these sites were phosphorylated in vitro by DNA-PK (18Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Furthermore, serine 15 of p53 has been shown to be one site which is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage (19Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Mutation of the serine 15 phosphorylation site of human p53 to alanine demonstrated impaired transactivation of p53 and, as a consequence, impaired cell-cycle arrest at the G1/S transition (20Fiscella M.

Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar) made reference to unpublished data showing constitutive and induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 in murine scid cells, implying that other pathways distinct from DNA-PK can phosphorylate p53 at serine 15 in response to DNA damage. The ATM kinase is also a candidate kinase for phosphorylation of serine 15, but ATM-deficient cells also show induced phosphorylation at this site implying parallel pathways to signal stress, such as DNA damage, via phosphorylation of serine 15 of p53. More recent studies have shown that adding back the ATM gene in these deficient cells results in increased phosphorylation at the serine 15 site, using a specific phosphoserine antibody (21Canman C.E.

The other two gene products, Ku80 and Ku70, which together with thescid gene product (DNA-PKcs) constitute the DNA-PK holoenzyme, have also been shown to be involved in the same response pathways, since cells containing mutant or absent Ku 80 or Ku 70 are sensitive to IR and deficient V(D)J recombination (31Taccioli G.E.

A number of recent reports have shown that the p53 response and the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint in murine scid cells is normal (34Huang L.C. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 68-74PubMed Google Scholar), casting serious doubt about any connection between p53 and DNA-PK. However, none of these publications looked in detail at the kinetics of cell cycle arrest or the timing of transactivation of p53-dependent downstream genes by observing multiple time points following exposure to ionizing radiation or other DNA damaging agent. Furthermore, DNA damage induced phosphorylation of serine 15 of p53 results in alleviation of the inhibition from MDM2 (18Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that DNA-PKcs is necessary for activation of DNA binding by p53 (in response to IR) in a gel shift assay (39Woo R.A. McLure K.G. Lees-Miller S.P. Rancourt D.E. Lee P.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Failure to phosphorylate p53 could produce the phenotype ofscid cells: an attenuated and perhaps delayed response produced in proportion to the elevation of levels of p53, without the rapid response brought about by loss of inhibition by MDM2. The effect of DNA-PK could be directly on p53 or indirectly on an inhibitory protein such as MDM2. It has recently been suggested that DNA-PK might phosphorylate MDM2, which then prevents inhibition of p53 (40Mayo L.D. Turchi J.J. Berberich S.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5013-5016PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are not mutually exclusive, and therefore the effect of loss of DNA-PK activity could be a combined effect of lack of phosphorylation of p53 (resulting in impaired transactivation) and lack of phosphorylation of MDM2 which then continues to attenuate p53 (rather than phosphorylation which results in less inhibition of p53). Thus, the exact role of DNA-PK in vivo remains to be defined, as it appears to function both in DNA repair and in sensing DNA damage (41Jeggo P.A. Taccioli G.E. Jackson S.P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The gene mutated in patients with ataxia telangiectasia (ATM) produces a protein which is related to DNA-PKcs. Cells containing mutant or absent ATM have previously been described to have an abnormal response of p53 to IR (42Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar). Although the precise nature of the p53 response in ataxia telangiectasia cells has been debated (42Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar, 43Lu X. Lane D.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 765-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) there now appears to be a consensus that the response is delayed and attenuated (44Canman C.E. Wolff A.C. Chen C.Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Kastan M.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5054-5058PubMed Google Scholar, 45Jongmans W. Artuso M. Vuillaume M. Bresil H. Jackson S.P. Hall J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1133-1138PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the DNA damage response pathways in mouse scid cells in order to ascertain whether DNA-PK can regulate the function of p53 in vivo. p53 function was analyzed in two murine cell cultures: primary murine embryonic (day 20–22) fibroblasts (MEF) from a normal mouse (FC) and from a Balb-C derived scid mouse (FS). The primary cultures were established directly from the mouse embryos obtained from the Edwin L Steele Laboratory, Massachusetts General Hospital, as described previously (46Budach W. Hartford A. Gioioso D. Freeman J. Taghian A. Suit H.D. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6292-6296PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. The medium was supplemented with 1 mg/ml glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 20 mmol of Hepes solution (Sigma). The cells were maintained in exponential growth in monolayer cultures, and used within 10–12 passages from their initial establishment in cell culture. If cells were maintained in cell culture for more than 20 passages, a significant incidence of developing abnormal p53 function was observed (47Mekeel K.L. Tang W. Kachnic L.A. Luo C.M. DeFrank J.S. Powell S.N. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1847-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Retroviral constructs containing the E6 protein of human papilloma virus type 16/18 (pXIPneoE6; D. Galloway, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center) were transferred into FC and FS cells, and cells containing a stable integration of the vector were selected by growth in G418 (0.5 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.). Murine embryonic fibroblasts from normal and scid mice were plated in 150-mm dishes and grown to 50–70% confluence at the time of irradiation. The tissue culture medium was renewed 1 day prior to irradiation to remove non-viable unattached cells. Ionizing radiation was delivered using either a60Co source (Theratron) or a linear accelerator delivering 4MV x-rays (Varian). The cell cycle at the G1/S transition in response to IR was measured using flow cytometry as described previously (48Powell S.N. DeFrank J.S. Connell P. Eogan M. Preffer F. Dombkowski D. Tang W. Friend S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1643-1648PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, exponentially growing cells (1–5 × 105) were irradiated with 8 Gy IR and collected at specific time points (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h) following irradiation. The cells were harvested from the culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before suspension in 0.75 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol, and incubated on ice for >1 h. The cells were pelleted, washed a further two times in PBS, and then exposed to propidium iodide (100 μg/ml) and RNase A (500 μg/ml). DNA analysis was performed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) emitting a 488-nm beam (26Lieber M.R. Hesse J.E. Lewis S. Bosma G.C. Rosenberg N. Mizuuchi K. Bosma M.J. Gellert M. Cell. 1988; 55: 7-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The G1/S transition was evaluated by the decrease in the proportion of S-phase cells coupled with an accumulation of cells in G1, with time after irradiation. Cells were harvested and lysed at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h after 8 Gy irradiation, in parallel with the flow cytometric analysis. For each time point, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, then 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmA-protinin) was added and cells were scraped from the plates. The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatant was then removed and protein levels quantified using the Bio-Rad protein quantification solution. Whole cell lysates were stored at −70 °C. Preparation of nuclear lysates, at the same time points as the collection of whole cell lysates, used the method described by Price and Calderwood (49Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3055-3062PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were first washed twice in ice-cold PBS, then 0.8 ml of nuclear lysis buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100) was added and cells were scraped from the plates. The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 5 min and then spun down at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was then removed and pellet was re-suspended in 400 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the mixture was then spun at 25,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant (containing nuclear proteins) was then removed and the protein quantified. The lysates were stored at −70 °C. After protein quantification, Western analysis (immunoblot) was carried out using standard procedures with the use of antibodies against p53 (pAb 421-Oncogene Science), p21 (Santa Cruz), and mouse MDM2 (2A10, A. J. Levine, Princeton (50Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar)). In summary, 50 μg of protein were loaded into each well of a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and electrophoresis carried out with 1 × Tris glycine running buffer (Bio-Rad). After membrane transfer, blocking was performed with 10% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween-PBS solution followed by incubation with the relevant antibodies. Antibody detection employed the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) technique. Relative signal intensity of the protein bands was measured using an Epson 636 scanner with transparency adapter. Cells were grown on slides for 24 h before irradiation and stained 6 h later. Cells were washed 2 times in PBS, fixed in 70% methanol, and 30% acetone for 2 min and then washed again with PBS. The primary antibody used for p53 analysis was pAb421 at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 6 h and then washed 3 times in PBS. The secondary antibody used was the fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Oncogene Science). The cells were incubated for 6 h in the dark at room temperature with a 1:10 dilution of the secondary antibody in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS. Slides were prepared using the Dako mounting solution (Oncogene), coverslipped, and stored in the dark at 4 °C. Immunofluorescence studies always included a negative control (secondary antibody alone) as well as a positive control (U2OS cells, a cell line derived from human osteosarcoma, with high levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic p53). Normal fibroblasts with wild-type p53 function arrest in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle when exposed to IR (42Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar,51Huang L.C. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This response is attributable to the activation of p53 by radiation-induced DNA damage or similar lesions. If DNA-PK participates directly in DNA damage recognition and transmits this signal to p53, the scid (DNA-PK catalytic subunit deficient) fibroblasts may show an abnormality in G1/S arrest. Fibroblasts isolated from mouse scid lines (FS) as well as normal mouse fibroblasts (FC), both of which contain wild-type p53, were exposed to 8 Gy IR. The effect on cell cycle progression was demonstrated by the accumulation of cells at the G1/S checkpoint, which occurred at 6–9 h in FC cells, as shown in Fig. 1A. The kinetics of this normal response has been previously described (1Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). However, a delayed and attenuated G1 arrest was noted in the FS fibroblasts, which showed little reduction in the S-phase fraction at 9 h, and only by 24 h was there evidence of accumulation of cells in G1 and diminution of cells in S-phase, as shown in Fig. 1B. To demonstrate that scid cells have residual function of p53, pXIPneoE6 was transfected and maintained in both normal and scid MEF cells. The transfected cells then expressed little or no detectable p53 (data not shown), as has been shown by multiple previous reports. Fig. 1C shows the flow cytometric profile in response to DNA damage in scid cells with E6 protein. At 9 h after 8 Gy of IR, there is a lack of any detectable accumulation of cells in G1 and no decrease in the proportion of S-phase cells. The lack of cells in G1 and the large accumulation of cells in G2 makes the estimation of S-phase more difficult, but the most conservative model to fit the data supports the lack of decrease in S-phase component. At 24 h, cells remain detectable throughout G1 and S-phase, again suggesting the loss of any G1/S checkpoint in response to DNA damage. The flow cytometric profile of FC-E6 in response to IR was essentially the same as FS-E6 (data not shown). Both FS and FC cells have been transfected with a CMV based expression vector containing a dominant negative mutation of p53, alanine 143, and neither cell line shows a G1/S arrest or p21WAF1/cip1 response (data not shown) confirming that the responses are p53-dependent. An increase in p53 protein levels appears to be closely linked to the IR-induced G1 arrest. Since scid fibroblasts lack the normal arrest kinetics in DNA synthesis after exposure to IR, the relationship between the scid phenotype (deficient in DNA-PK activity) and p53 function was investigated. Immunoblotting of the lysates from FS and FC cell cultures at times following exposure to 8 Gy IR is shown in Fig. 2A. The response of p53 to DNA damage showed only a 3-fold increase at 3–6 h and was not significantly different between FS and FC lines. Although the cell cycle arrest kinetics were delayed in the scid MEF, the rise and fall of p53 appeared to be normal. Interestingly inscid cells, there is a second rise in p53 levels at 24 h. These findings were reproduced in three independent experiments and was thought to be due to persistent DNA breaks. The conclusion is that DNA-PK does not affect the regulation of p53 levels, which is largely determined by degradation processes. Analysis of the same cell lysates from FS and FC for induction of p21, revealed that the rise of p21WAF1/cip1 was attenuated and delayed in FS cells. Fig. 2B shows a 3-fold increase in p21WAF1/cip1 in the scid MEF, FS, which was seen maximally at 12–24 h. It is noted that the p21 band in FS cells appears to be slightly shifted below the control band. However, the stringency of the blot suggests a specific, albeit weak, signal. No time points beyond 24 h were evaluated, although cells which continue to grow after irradiation show that p21WAF1/cip1levels return to baseline levels (data not shown). In contrast, a >5-fold induction seen at 3–6 h in FC cells. These findings are in keeping with the differences in cell cycle arrest kinetics previously demonstrated in Fig. 1.

https://openalex.org/W2080168412,"Copper-containing hemocyanins serve to transport oxygen in many arthropod species. Here I describe the identification and cDNA cloning of a structurally closely related non-respiratory pseudo-hemocyanin (PHc) of the American lobster, Homarus americanus. This protein has lost the ability to bind copper and, therefore, oxygen because a histidine residue in copper-binding site A is replaced by tyrosine. Like many arthropod hemocyanins, PHc forms a hexamer. It consists of two different subunit types of 660 and 661 amino acids, respectively, that share a 94.4% sequence identity. Whereas Homarus hemocyanin is produced in the hepatopancreas, PHc is synthesized by the ovaries and the heart tissue. Because different levels of PHc were observed in distinct individuals, I propose an association of the synthesis of this protein with the molting or reproduction cycle, similar to the hexamerins, insect storage proteins that are also related to the hemocyanins. However, phylogenetic analyses show that PHc derived independently from crustacean hemocyanins. Therefore, Homarus PHc is a member of a new class within the growing hemocyanin protein superfamily.

The body fluid of many arthropod species contains large copper proteins that serve to transport oxygen and are referred to as hemocyanins (1Markl J. Biol. Bull.

The principal structure of a hexamer of six similar or identical subunits in the 75 kDa range is conserved within all hemocyanins, although in many species, these hexamers associate to quaternary structures of up to 8 × 6 subunits (3Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar). Each subunit carries one oxygen molecule by virtue of two copper ions that are coordinated by six histidine residues (4Gaykema W.P.J. Hol W.G.J. Vereifken J.M. Soeter N.M. Bak H.J. Beintema J.J.

The loss of the oxygen transport function is accompanied by the replacement of the coordinating histidine residues in the copper-binding center by other amino acids. Hexamerin-type proteins have been discovered in the hemolymph or storage tissues in all insects investigated (13Telfer W.H. Kunkel J.G. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1991; 36: 205-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). They are generally assumed to act as storage proteins that provide energy and amino acids for nonfeeding periods. Occasionally, in the hemolymph of some decapodan Crustacea, similar proteins were observed that resemble the hemocyanins and hexamerins in their specific appearance but do not bind oxygen (14Markl J. Hofer A. Bauer G. Markl A. Kemptner B. Brenzinger M. Linzen B. J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 133: 67-175Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Terwilliger N.B. Dangott L.J. Ryan M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In view of the recently proposed sister group relationship of the Insecta and Crustacea (e.g. 16, 17), these proteins were considered as possible ancestors of the hexamerins (7Beintema J.J. Stam W.T. Hazes B. Smidt M.P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar, 10Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Burmester T.

However, here I report two sequences of such a protein and show that, although they likely represent storage proteins as well, they evolved independently from crustacean hemocyanins. Because this protein closely resembles the crustacean hemocyanins but lacks copper and the oxygen-binding function, here it is termed pseudo-hemocyanin (PHc). 1The abbreviation used is: PHc, pseudo-hemocyanin; NRP, non-respiratory protein; SDS-PAGE, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBST, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.25% Tween-20; SSC, saline/sodium citrate; kb, kilobase pair(s).1The abbreviation used is: PHc, pseudo-hemocyanin; NRP, non-respiratory protein; SDS-PAGE, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBST, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.25% Tween-20; SSC, saline/sodium citrate; kb, kilobase pair(s). Living adult Homarus americanus(Crustacea, Malacostraca, Decapoda, and Homaridae) were purchased from a local seafood dealer, anesthetized, and immediately dissected. The hemolymph was withdrawn from the abdominal sinus by a syringe and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to remove hemocytes, tissue contamination, and clotted material. The supernatant was used as purified hemolymph. Tissues were either immediately used for RNA preparation or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for no longer than 4 weeks. About 0.5–1 ml (approximately 50–200 mg of total protein) of freshly collected hemolymph was applied to a Biogel A5 m (Bio-Rad) column (1.5 × 100 cm) as described by Markl et al. (14Markl J. Hofer A. Bauer G. Markl A. Kemptner B. Brenzinger M. Linzen B. J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 133: 67-175Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Elution was performed with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmCaCl2. The eluted material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of PHc and purity. The oxygen binding capacity of the different fractions was analyzed spectrometrically by reading the absorption at 280 and 340 nm. The second large peak (16 S) contains the PHc fraction. Electron microscopy of the different fractions was performed by negative staining with uranyl-acetate (18Harris J.R. Agutter P.S. J. Ultrastruc. Res. 1970; 33: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against the PHc were raised in guinea pigs and checked for specificity by Western blotting. SDS-PAGE was performed on a 7.5% gel according to standard procedures (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 0.8 mA/cm2. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST. Incubation with the anti-PHc-IgGs (diluted 1:10,000 in 5% non-fat dry milk and TBST) was carried out for 2 h at room temperature. The filters were washed three times for 20 min each in TBST and subsequently incubated for 1 h with goat anti-guinea pig Fab fragments conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Dianova) diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk and Tris-buffered saline. The membranes were washed as described above, and the detection was carried out using nitroblue tetrazolium and bromo-chloro-indolyl-phosphate. N-terminal sequencing was performed by a commercial service (H. Heid, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany) using protein samples separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described previously. The PHc and hemocyanin bands were excised and submitted to Edman degradation. Total RNA was either isolated from the complete thorax of a single lobster without the legs and the cuticle or prepared from defined tissues by the method of Scheller and Karlson (20Scheller K. Karlson P. J. Insect Physiol. 1977; 23: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA using the Poly(A)Tract kit (Promega). About 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were used for the construction of a directionally cloned cDNA expression library applying the Lambda ZAP cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). The library was amplified once and screened with α-PHc antibodies. Positive phage clones were converted to plasmid vectors using the material provided by Stratagene in the cDNA synthesis kit. The PHc cDNAs inserted in the pBK-CMV vector were sequenced on both strands by the commercial SeqLab (Göttingen) sequencing service. Equal amounts of RNA from different tissues were denatured and subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing 1 m formaldehyde. After electrophoresis, gels were rinsed in 20× SSC and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 20× SSC. Digoxigenin-UTP-labeled antisense RNA probes were transcribed from the complete cDNA clones using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals RNAin vitro transcription kit. The filters were pre-hybridized in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS, and 1% blocking agent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h and then hybridized in the same solution containing the labeled probe overnight at 60 °C. Immunodetection was carried out using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals digoxigenin detection kit as described by the manufacturer. The programs provided with Sequence Analysis Software Package 8.0 from the Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin were used for sequence analysis and manipulation. For phylogenetic inference, the deduced PHc protein sequence was aligned by hand to the previously published alignment of hemocyanins and hexamerins (12Burmester T. Massey Jr., H.C. Zakharkin S.O. Beneš H. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), including other sequences that became available only recently. The complete alignment is available from the author upon request. Distances between the pairs of protein sequences were calculated and corrected for multiple changes according to Dayhoff's empirical PAM 001 matrix by using the PROTDIST program of the PHYLIP 3.5c package (21Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure (Volume 5, Supplement 3). National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, DC1979Google Scholar). Phylogenetic inference was carried out using either the neighbor joining method (22Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) or the maximum parsimony method implemented in the PROTPARS program of the PHYLIP 3.5c software package (23Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) Version 3.5c. Distributed by the author. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle1993Google Scholar). The robustness of the trees was tested by bootstrap analysis (24Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 100 replications (SEQBOOT program). Majority role consensus trees were obtained using the CONSENSE program. The separation of the hemolymph proteins of adult H. americanus by gel filtration on a Biogel A5 m column yields two major peaks corresponding to the sedimentation coefficients in the analytical ultracentrifugation of about 16 S and 24 S (Fig. 1A; Ref. 14Markl J. Hofer A. Bauer G. Markl A. Kemptner B. Brenzinger M. Linzen B. J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 133: 67-175Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The dodecameric (2 × 6) hemocyanin elutes at 24 S (14Markl J. Hofer A. Bauer G. Markl A. Kemptner B. Brenzinger M. Linzen B. J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 133: 67-175Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar,25Stöcker W. Raeder U. Bijlholt M.M.C. Wichertjes T. van Bruggen E.F.J. Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. 1988; 158B: 271-289Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This peak displays an UV spectrum with a 280 nm:340 nm absorption ratio of about 5, which is typical for a native hemocyanin and indicates the formation of the copper-oxygen complex that causes increased absorption at a wavelength of 340 nm. The second major peak that elutes at 16 S has a 280 nm:340 nm ratio of >20 (Fig. 1B), indicating a protein that does not bind oxygen by a copper complex and that has therefore been referred to as non-respiratory protein (NRP) (14Markl J. Hofer A. Bauer G. Markl A. Kemptner B. Brenzinger M. Linzen B. J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 133: 67-175Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) However, to avoid possible confusion with chelicerate NRPs that are not related to hemocyanin (26Markl J. Markl A. Schartau W. Linzen B. J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 130: 283-292Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), theH. americanus NRP has been renamed PHc here. Electron microscopic examination of the 24 S fraction shows the presence of the dodecameric hemocyanin, consisting of two hexamers of 10 nm in diameter each (Fig. 2A) (25Stöcker W. Raeder U. Bijlholt M.M.C. Wichertjes T. van Bruggen E.F.J. Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. 1988; 158B: 271-289Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 16 S fraction (Fig. 2B) contains a protein with a diameter of about 12 nm that resembles a typical hexameric hemocyanin, with six subunits arranged as a trigonal antiprism (4Gaykema W.P.J. Hol W.G.J. Vereifken J.M. Soeter N.M. Bak H.J. Beintema J.J. Nature. 1984; 309: 23-29Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). After separation on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A), the 24 S fraction shows three bands with apparent molecular masses of 76–80 kDa, and the 16 S fraction separates into two PHc subunits of about 85 and 86 kDa (14Markl J. Hofer A. Bauer G. Markl A. Kemptner B. Brenzinger M. Linzen B. J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 133: 67-175Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised against the 16 S fraction in guinea pigs. In Western blotting, these antibodies recognize only the PHcs and not the hemocyanin subunits, whereas the anti-hemocyanin antibodies (25Stöcker W. Raeder U. Bijlholt M.M.C. Wichertjes T. van Bruggen E.F.J. Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. 1988; 158B: 271-289Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) do not stain PHc (Fig. 3B). After transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, 20–22 N-terminal amino acids of the PHc and hemocyanin subunits were determined by microsequencing (Fig. 3C). Because the first 12 amino acids of the two PHc subunits are identical, only the 86-kDa subunit was sequenced up to the 20th residue. Database research shows that this sequence clearly belongs to the hemocyanin superfamily.Figure 3Electrophoretic properties and N-terminal sequences of Homarushemocyanin and PHc subunits. A, proteins of total hemolymph (HL), the 24 S peak (25Stöcker W. Raeder U. Bijlholt M.M.C. Wichertjes T. van Bruggen E.F.J. Markl J. J. Comp.

The library was amplified once, and about 3 × 105 clones were screened with the anti-PHc antibodies. 29 positive clones were identified. Three clones (clones 11, 31, and 42) with cDNA inserts between 2.3 and 2.5 kb were subjected to further analysis and sequenced (Fig. 4). Whereas clones 31 and 42 are identical (except in the length of the 5′ region), clone 11 represents another PHc clone. The identity score on the nucleotide level within the coding region of the native polypeptides is 96%. However, there are fundamental differences in the 3′ noncoding region, and only limited conservation is seen in the putative signal peptide. Restriction enzyme analysis (EcoRI/XhoI) of other positive clones allowed the assignment to either one of the clone types. Conceptual translation of the PHc clone shows that both sequences cover the actual N terminus of the native polypeptide, whereas they are not complete in the 5′ sequences that very likely correspond to the signal peptide of the nascent protein. Clone 11 (referred to as PHc-1 in the remainder of the text) has 71 nucleotides of the putative signal peptide, clone 31 (PHc-2) has 65 nucleotides of the putative signal peptide, and clone 42 has 53 nucleotides of the putative signal peptide. The deduced N termini of both PHcs are identical, match exactly to those that have been determined by microsequencing of the proteins, and confirm the identity of the clones. The inferred primary structures of the native PHc proteins yield polypeptides of 661 (PHc-1) and 660 (PHc-2) amino acids with deduced molecular masses of 77,313 and 76,970 Da, respectively. The PHc amino acid sequences share 623 common residues (94.4% identity; 97.6% similarity, considering conservative replacements). Computer analysis reveals the presence of four conserved potential N-glycosylation sites (NXT) in both PHc (Fig. 7). The expression of PHc mRNA in different tissues was examined by Northern blotting (Fig. 5). A single strong PHc signal of about 2.5 kb was observed in the ovaries, whereas less PHc mRNA is present in the heart tissues. Except for the ovaries, no difference was observed between the sexes. No PHc expression was detected in the hepatopancreas, the site of hemocyanin synthesis in H. americanus (27Senkbeil E.G. Wriston J.C. J. Comp. Physiol. 1981; 68B: 163-171Google Scholar), and in three other tissues analyzed (gills, connective tissue, and muscle). When comparing the level of PHc in the hemolymph of different individuals, significant differences in the amount of this protein were observed (Fig. 6). A total of eight adult lobsters (two female, four male, and two of undetermined sex) weighing around 500 g were investigated. Complete absence of PHc was detected in one male and in one individual of undetermined sex, whereas hemocyanin subunits are present in all animals. Therefore, PHc is not a female-specific protein.Figure 6Analysis of the hemolymph proteins of different individuals by SDS-PAGE . The numbers identify individual specimens; the sex is indicated at the top of the lanes. About 20 μl of a 1:100 dilution were applied per lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Database searches show that PHc displays the highest similarity with crustacean hemocyanins (47–56% identity, 74–80% similarity) and the cryptocyanin of the Dungeness crab Cancer magister (15Terwilliger N.B. Dangott L.J. Ryan M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (50% identity, 74% similarity), whereas lower similarity scores were observed with chelicerate hemocyanins, arthropod prophenoloxidases, and insect hexamerins. Hemocyanins transport oxygen by two copper ions coordinated by six histidine residues, which are arranged in two copper-binding sites (1Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar, 2van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar, 4Gaykema W.P.J. Hol W.G.J. Vereifken J.M. Soeter N.M. Bak H.J. Beintema J.J.

These histidines are also present in the arthropod prophenoloxidases (8Fujimoto K. Okino N. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Ohnishi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7769-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Kawabata T. Yasuhara Y. Ochiai M. Matsuura S. Ashida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, whereas five of these residues are conserved within PHc as well, the first histidine in copper-binding site A is replaced in both PHc-1 and PHc-2 by a tyrosine (Fig. 7). To infer the position of the PHc proteins within the superfamily of arthropod hemocyanins and hexamerins, the amino acid sequences were included in a multiple sequence alignment that has been described in an earlier study (12Burmester T. Massey Jr., H.C. Zakharkin S.O. Beneš H. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Two recently published sequences (15Terwilliger N.B. Dangott L.J. Ryan M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Sánchez D. Ganfornina M.D. Gutiérrez G. Bastiani M.J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were added as well. The hemocyanins of the Chelicerata were considered to be the most ancient branch and were used here as the outgroup (12Burmester T. Massey Jr., H.C. Zakharkin S.O. Beneš H. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), although no differences in the arrangement of the clades were observed when using the arthropod prophenoloxidases as the outgroup (10Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Both distance matrix methods and maximum parsimony show that the PHcs are associated with the cryptocyanin of Cancer magister (Fig. 8). There is strong statistical support that these three non-respiratory proteins are included within the clade of the crustacean hemocyanins (100% bootstrap value). However, whereas parsimony analysis indicates a moderately supported association of the PHcs and cryptocyanin with a clade comprising hemocyanin C of the spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus, hemocyanin 6 of C. magister, and a hemocyanin of the shrimp Penaeus vannamei (63% bootstrap support; Fig. 8A), distance matrix methods show PHc in the sister group position to all sequenced crustacean hemocyanins (75% bootstrap support; Fig. 8B). The hemocyanins of arthropods have been subjected to detailed functional, structural, and evolutionary studies, mainly in the Chelicerata and Crustacea (see Refs 1Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar, 2van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar and 7Beintema J.J. Stam W.T. Hazes B. Smidt M.P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar). Among the Crustacea, only the Malacostraca possess hemocyanins, whereas these proteins are apparently absent in other crustacean taxa (35Mangum C.P. Bliss D.E. Mantel L.H. The Biology of Crustacea. 5. Academic Press, New York1983: 373-429Google Scholar). In the American lobster, H. americanus, dodecameric hemocyanin represents about 60–90% of the total hemolymph proteins (27Senkbeil E.G. Wriston J.C. J. Comp. Physiol. 1981; 68B: 163-171Google Scholar). An additional hexameric protein with similar biophysical properties was identified inHomarus as well as in other decapodan species and termed NRP (14Markl J. Hofer A. Bauer G. Markl A. Kemptner B. Brenzinger M. Linzen B. J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 133: 67-175Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the nature of these proteins has long remained obscure. Here I report two sequences of the NRP of H. americanus that clearly show that this protein is related to the hemocyanins as well as to the other members of the hemocyanin superfamily (Fig. 7). To emphasize its particular similarity to hemocyanin on one hand and to avoid confusion with other non-respiratory hemolymph proteins on the other hand, it has been renamed PHc. This protein is very likely homologous to the recently described cryptocyanin of C. magister, a non-respiratory, hemocyanin-related protein associated with the molting cycle (15Terwilliger N.B. Dangott L.J. Ryan M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The native PHc protein consists of two different subunits of 660 and 661 amino acids, respectively, that are termed PHc-1 and PHc-2. In SDS-PAGE, two polypeptides are consistently present in approximately equimolar amounts that probably correspond to each of the PHc cDNAs (Fig. 2). Whereas the nucleotide sequences are very similar within the coding region for the native protein, they vary greatly in the signal peptide coding region and in the 3′ untranslated part. This observation is consistent with the assumption that the two cDNAs are encoded by two genes rather than representing different alleles in the population. The conservation of two different, expressed genes provides further evidence that these hemocyanin-like proteins are functional, although they do not act as respiratory proteins. The inability of PHc to bind copper ions and, therefore, form the copper-oxygen complex (Fig. 1B) can now be explained by the replacement of a single histidine with a tyrosine in copper-binding site A in both types of subunits, whereas the other copper-coordinating residues are conserved (Fig. 7). Otherwise, the PHcs closely resemble the crustacean hemocyanins in sequence and structure. The molecular masses deduced from conceptual translation (77.0 and 77.3 kDa) of the cDNA clones are significantly lower than those determined experimentally by SDS-PAGE (85 and 86 kDa; Fig. 2). However, four potential N-glycosylation sites are present in each of the PHc subunits (Fig. 4), indicating a heavily glycosylated protein. By contrast, the crustacean hemocyanins possess either none or only one glycosylation site per subunit (Fig. 7). Although the mRNA for the PHcs accumulates in the ovaries of the adult female (Fig. 5), there is not sufficient evidence to deduce sex-specific differences of PHc levels in the hemolymph (Fig. 6). One can speculate that ovary PHc mRNA may code for some storage proteins that are transported into the developing eggs. Additional studies are required to elucidate the potential role of the PHcs in reproduction. Heart tissue appears to be the principle site of PHc synthesis in both sexes and is sufficient to produce high amounts of PHc. However, the PHcs are not constitutively expressed because a complete absence of this protein was observed in two of eight individuals, demonstrating that this protein is dispensable (Fig. 6). One may speculate that the appearance of the PHcs is either associated with nutritional conditions or, similar to the Cancercryptocyanin (15Terwilliger N.B. Dangott L.J. Ryan M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), depends on the molting cycle. Unfortunately, due to the long molting cycle of H. americanus, a possible stage-specific analysis of the expression of the PHcs is currently beyond experimental control. It has been hypothesized the PHcs might represent the ancestors of the insect hexamerins (7Beintema J.J. Stam W.T. Hazes B. Smidt M.P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar, 10Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Burmester T. Massey Jr., H.C. Zakharkin S.O. Beneš H. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Telfer W.H. Kunkel J.G. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1991; 36: 205-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), copper-free hemolymph proteins that resemble the hemocyanins in structure and sequence (6Willott E. Wang X.-Y. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19052-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Telfer W.H. Kunkel J.G. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1991; 36: 205-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) but had lost the ability to bind oxygen. However, the present phylogenetic analyses clearly show that the PHcs, as well as the cryptocyanin of C. magister (15Terwilliger N.B. Dangott L.J. Ryan M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), are not particularly related to the hexamerins but are authentic descendants of the crustacean hemocyanins (Fig. 8). The trees suggest that PHc and cryptocyanin emerged from the hemocyanins early in decapodan evolution, before the Astacura (Homarus) and Brachyura (Cancer) diverged. Although other specific roles of PHc are possible, it likely acts as some kind of storage protein. It has been repeatedly observed that hemocyanin concentration decreases drastically during starvation or molting (36Depledge M.N. Bjerregaard P. Helgol. Meeresunters. 1989; 43: 207-223Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This does not necessarily mean that hemocyanins actually act as storage proteinssensu stricto, but they are dispensable, at least in some species and under particular developmental or environmental conditions. The evolutionary advantage of more specialized storage proteins like the PHcs may be to uncouple the synthesis of oxygen transport proteins and of proteins that specifically accumulate amino acids and energy. The fact that hemocyanins were used twice in evolution for similar purposes may hint at some particular structural advantages, which may be either their stability in the hemolymph or their high molecular mass that allows the accumulation of many amino acids with low osmotic impact.

https://openalex.org/W2007224508,"Brain-enriched human FC96 protein shows a close sequence similarity to the Dictyostelium actin-binding protein coronin, which has been implicated in cell motility, cytokinesis, and phagocytosis. A phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that FC96 and two other mammalian molecules (p57 and IR10) form a new protein family, the coronin-like protein (Clipin) family; thus hereafter we refer to FC96 as ClipinC. A WD domain and a succeeding α-helical region are conserved among coronin and Clipin family members. ClipinC is predominantly expressed in the brain, and discrete areas in the mouse brain were intensely labeled with anti-ClipinC antibodies. ClipinC was also shown to bind directly to F-actin in vitro. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that ClipinC accumulated at focal adhesions as well as at neurite tips and stress fibers. Furthermore, ClipinC was associated with vinculin, which is a major component of focal contacts. These results indicate that ClipinC is also a component part of the cross-bridge between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. These findings and the previously reported function of coronin suggest that ClipinC may play specific roles in the reorganization of neuronal actin structure, a change that has been implicated in both cell motility and growth cone advance.

Actin filaments in neuronal cells form a cortical framework that helps to localize membrane proteins, and F-actin dynamics has been implicated in directing neuronal outgrowth. Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton occurs in response to various stimuli such as soluble factors or attachment to a substratum (1Stossel T.P.

The regulation of F-actin patterns involves actin polymerization and actin cross-linking. Factors regulating these processes communicate with the small G proteins of the Rho family (3Van Aelst L.

The Dictyostelium actin-binding protein coronin was first purified from an actin-myosin complex and was hypothesized to transmit signals from the membrane receptors to the cortical cytoskeleton (5de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Coronin accumulates at the leading edges of moving cells and in crown-shaped extensions on the dorsal cell surface. The involvement of coronin in cell motility, cytokinesis, and phagocytosis, all of which depend on cytoskeletal rearrangement, has been demonstrated by use of a gene replacement mutant. In a mutant that lacks coronin, cell motility is reduced to less than half of the normal speed, and cytoplasmic cleavage in cytokinesis is impaired (6de Hostos E.L. Rehfueß C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Further, in the coronin null (cor−) mutant, the rate of yeast uptake is reduced by about 70% (7Maniak M. Rauchenberger R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Cell. 1995; 83: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, the distribution of actin filaments in cor− cells is similar to that in the wild-type ones (6de Hostos E.L. Rehfueß C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this study, we found a novel candidate for an actin cytoskeleton-cortical membrane linking protein; this protein, ClipinC, is also the third member of a family of mammalian homologs ofDictyostelium coronin. The ClipinC transcript was predominantly expressed in the nervous system. The association of ClipinC with F-actin was demonstrated in vitro. Immunocytochemical analysis of neuronal cells showed that ClipinC accumulated at neurite tips and focal adhesions and along stress fibers. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that ClipinC was associated with vinculin, which is a cytoskeletal protein implicated in the control of adhesion or motility (8Varnum-Finney B. Reichart L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1071-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and is a major constituent of focal adhesions (9Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Together with the recent report on the phenotype of a coronin null mutant, the present study indicates that ClipinC may play specific roles in the reorganization of neuronal actin structure, a change that has been implicated in both cell motility during neuronal development and growth cone advance leading to synapse formation. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. COS-1 and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. An equalized cDNA library was previously constructed from a human forebrain cortex (10Sasaki Y.F. Iwasaki T. Kobayashi H. Tsuji S. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Individual clones from this library were sequenced and compared with sequences in the GenBankTM data base, as described before (11Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar). Thereby 100 unidentified clones were collected, and their tissue specificity was examined by RNA dot blot analysis (11Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar). One brain-enriched clone, FC96, was selected for further study. To obtain the full-length clone of FC96, we screened a human frontal cortex-derived cDNA library (Stratagene) with the 1.0-kilobaseEcoRI-XhoI fragment of clone FC96. Eight overlapping cDNAs were obtained, and the nucleotide sequences of these cDNAs were determined to give rise to the complete coding sequence of FC96, i.e. of ClipinC. Human multiple tissue blots I and II (CLONTECH) were hybridized as described before (11Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar) with DNA probes: ClipinA/p57 (nucleotides 489–930) (12Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), ClipinB/IR10 (nucleotides 372–1333) (13Zaphiropoulos P.G. Toftgård R. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; : 15Google Scholar), and ClipinC (nucleotides 587–1602). The ClipinA and B probes used were the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products from human brain poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH). Rabbits were immunized with the purified recombinant ClipinC protein (amino acids 297–475) expressed as a histidine-tagged form. For immunohistochemistry, heads of mouse embryos and newborns were fixed in ice-cold 5% acetic acid in ethanol. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 8-μm-thick microtome sections from paraffin-embedded brains. The sections were pretreated with 3% hydrogen peroxide, washed, and incubated with the polyclonal antibodies against ClipinC at a dilution of 1:5000. After having been washed, the sections were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (MBL). The immunocomplexes were visualized in 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, and 0.1% hydrogen peroxide. For actin cosedimentation, skeletal muscle actin (Sigma) was resuspended in actin polymerization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2). [35S]Methionine-labeled FLAG-tagged ClipinC and a control protein (firefly luciferase) were synthesized by coupled transcription and translation by use of a TNT expression system (Promega). The FLAG-tagged 35S-ClipinC was purified by means of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Kodak). In tubes without actin,35S-ClipinC or luciferase TNT product was diluted in the actin polymerization buffer. In those with actin, the TNT product was added to the resuspended actin (1 mg/ml). Mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C and then centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C and 100,000 × g. Supernatants and pellets were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Cells were fixed in 1% fresh formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After having been soaked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum, the samples were incubated with the anti-ClipinC antibodies at a dilution of 1:2000 to 1:5000, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Tago). Staining the same cells for F-actin or vinculin was performed with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) or 5 μg/ml of anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody V284 (Cybus Biotechnology) and rhodamine-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon), respectively. The samples were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and examined under a fluorescence microscope (Axiophoto2; Carl Zeiss). For antigen absorption experiments, anti-ClipinC antibody was incubated with the recombinant ClipinC-bound beads for 30 h before cell staining. Cells were lysed on ice for 1 h in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysates were then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. Immunoprecipitation was done by incubation with the desired primary antibodies and anti-mouse or rabbit IgG-agarose beads (American Qualex) at 4 °C for 12 h. Immune complexes were washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, eluted, and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (14Takeuchi K. Sato N. Kasahara H. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). For exogenous expression of FLAG-tagged ClipinC, the human ClipinC cDNA with the FLAG peptide tag at the carboxyl terminus was subcloned in the pSRα296 vector (15Tanabe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Akai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected into NIH3T3 cells by use of LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). An equalized cDNA library was previously constructed from human forebrain cortex. Using this library, we obtained and analyzed individual clones to search for novel genes that showed regional expression in the adult brain. In part of this research, 100 unidentified clones were collected based on partial DNA sequencing and comparison with a DNA data base, and then their tissue specificity was examined by RNA dot blot analysis. Among these clones, several genes were found to be abundantly expressed in the brain. The sequence of one of the brain-enriched cDNAs, clone FC96, had a remarkable similarity to that of coronin, an actin-binding protein in Dictyostelium discoideum (Fig. 1), and was selected for further investigation. The full-length FC96 transcript was 3.6 kilobases in size (Fig. 2A) and contained one open reading frame of 1728 base pairs. The open reading frame encoded a putative protein of 475 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 54.0 kDa (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the FC96 protein sequence with a protein data base disclosed an overall similarity to theDictyostelium coronin (38.5%) and its mammalian homologs,i.e. p57 (43.9%) (12Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and IR10 (61.0%) (13Zaphiropoulos P.G. Toftgård R. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; : 15Google Scholar). An amino-terminal domain containing five WD repeats and a succeeding domain covering about 100 amino acids with a tendency to form an α-helical structure were well conserved among these molecules. A phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that p57, IR10, and FC96 form a new protein family, the Clipin (coronin-likeprotein) family (Fig. 1B); thus hereafter we refer to p57, IR10, and FC96 as Clipins A, B, and C, respectively. We examined the expression of ClipinC mRNA in various human adult tissues and compared this expression with that of Clipins A and B (Fig. 2A). The level of the ClipinC mRNA was extremely high in the brain, moderate in heart and ovary, and very low or undetectable in the other tissues examined in this study. As previously reported (12Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the ClipinA transcript was mainly detected only in immune system tissues, i.e. spleen, thymus, and peripheral leukocytes. A high level expression of ClipinB was restricted to some tissues,e.g. colon, prostate, and testis, in which ClipinA and C transcripts were nearly undetectable. It is interesting to note that the expression profiles of Clipin members were tissue-specific and almost mutually exclusive. Northern blot analysis showed that ClipinC mRNA was preferentially expressed in brain tissue. We confirmed this point at the protein level by using polyclonal antibodies against ClipinC (data not shown). The antibodies specifically detected ClipinC protein in human and rat brains and neuronal cell lines of peripheral origin, such as SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells. ClipinC protein was undetected in the other tissues and non-neuronal cells examined. We next examined the distribution of ClipinC protein in various brain regions by using the ClipinC-selective antibodies (Fig. 2,B–D). ClipinC immunostaining was detected in discrete areas in the mouse brain. In the P1 brain, immunoreactivity was observed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum (Fig. 2, B and C). In the cerebellum, the Purkinje cell layer was intensely labeled; but no immunoreactivity was detected in the molecular layer or granule cell layer (Fig. 2B). Intense immunoreactivity was also observed in the inner nuclear (neuroblastic) layer in the retina and in the olfactory bulb of the mouse embryo (Fig. 2D). The close sequence similarity between ClipinC and coronin (Fig. 1) suggested that ClipinC is also an actin-binding protein; thus binding of ClipinC to actin filaments was investigated by spin-down experiments. Full-length ClipinC was prepared in vitro, added to the actin polymerization buffer, and incubated in the absence or presence of actin. Thenafter, macroaggregates were isolated by centrifugation. Fig. 3A showed that ClipinC cosedimented with F-actin. In control experiments, we also examined the cosedimentation property of firefly luciferase protein, which was in the soluble fraction even in the presence of actin (Fig. 3B). This confirmed that the ClipinC interaction with actin macroaggregates is selective. The anti-ClipinC antibodies were used for immunocytochemical studies of neuronal cells to assess the subcellular localization of ClipinC. Shown in Fig. 4 (A and C) are various shapes of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells stained for ClipinC. The site of localization of ClipinC in flattened SH-SY5Y cells was clarified by double-labeling of ClipinC (Fig. 4A) and F-actin (Fig. 4B). Staining for both ClipinC and F-actin was most intense at the focal contacts (arrowhead) and stress fibers (arrows). The accumulation of ClipinC at the focal adhesion, i.e. cross-bridge between the actin cytoskeleton and the substrate-adherent plasma membrane, was confirmed by double-staining for ClipinC (Fig. 4C) and vinculin, a major constituent of focal adhesive complexes (Fig. 4D). The data suggest that ClipinC is a component of the cross-bridge between actin filaments and the cortical membrane. Nuclear staining in SH-SY5Y cells stained for ClipinC (Fig. 4, A and C) was shown to be a nonspecific artifact by antigen absorption experiments (Fig. 4I). In Fig. 4 (E and F), nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells showing neurite outgrowth were stained for ClipinC. ClipinC remarkably accumulated at the tips of the neurites (arrows). Note that ClipinC was also abundant at the protrusions in the cellular periphery (arrowheads in Fig. 4E). In addition to the apparent accumulation of ClipinC at neurite tips, a considerable amount of ClipinC was dispersed in the cell body (Fig. 4G); this cytoplasmic distribution of ClipinC overlapped with that of F-actin (Fig. 4H). These data fit well with the previous observation thatDictyostelium coronin is reversibly recruited from the cytoplasm and is incorporated into the actin network of leading edges of the slime mold (16Gerisch G. Albrecht R. Heizer C. Hodgkinson S. Maniak M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1280-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The accumulation of ClipinC at focal adhesions was an unexpected result, and thus we tried to identify a focal adhesive protein(s) that specifically binds to ClipinC. [35S]Methionine-labeled SH-SY5Y cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-ClipinC antibodies. We observed the binding of several proteins to ClipinC; one of them had an approximate molecular mass of 120 kDa (data not shown). Vinculin, which was used as a marker of focal contacts in Fig. 4D, is a cytoskeletal protein of 117 kDa; thus we examined whether ClipinC could interact with vinculin in a physiological complex. In Fig. 5A, the ClipinC-selective antibodies coprecipitated vinculin from SH-SY5Y cells. The specificity of the immunoprecipitation was demonstrated by an antigen absorption experiment: the amount of vinculin coprecipitated with the antigen-absorbed anti-ClipinC antibodies (Fig. 5A,lane 2) was significantly reduced from that of the vinculin coprecipitated with the untreated antibodies (Fig. 5A,lane 1). Conversely, the anti-vinculin antibody coprecipitated ClipinC from SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 5B,lane 1), and the corresponding band of about 54 kDa was absent from the anti-vinculin immunoprecipitate of the COS-1 lysate containing no ClipinC protein (Fig. 5B, lane 2). The FLAG-tagged ClipinC exogenously expressed in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5C, lane 1) was also coprecipitated with the anti-vinculin antibody (Fig. 5C, lane 2). The specificity was confirmed by a similar experiment in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5C, lane 3). In NIH3T3 cells, the exogenously expressed ClipinC accumulated at focal adhesions in addition to being associated with stress fibers (data not shown), as it did in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 4, A–D). These results indicate that some amount of ClipinC was present in complexes with vinculin in focal adhesive structures. In this study, we found a novel candidate for a cytoskeleton plasma membrane connecting protein in neuronal cells. This protein, ClipinC, is also the third member of a family of mammalian homologs of coronin, a Dictyostelium actin-binding protein implicated in cell motility, cytokinesis, and phagocytosis (6de Hostos E.L. Rehfueß C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 7Maniak M. Rauchenberger R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Cell. 1995; 83: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The ClipinC transcript was predominantly expressed in the nervous system, and the association between ClipinC and F-actin was demonstrated in vitro. The association of ClipinC with actin filaments was observed at neurite tips and focal contacts and along stress fibers. ClipinC was shown to interact with vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein that is a major component of focal contacts (9Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) and is implicated in the control of growth cone motility (8Varnum-Finney B. Reichart L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1071-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These data suggest that ClipinC may play specific roles in the reorganization of neuronal actin structure. In coronin null mutants, cell locomotion, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis are slowed down, and cytokinesis is impaired (6de Hostos E.L. Rehfueß C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 7Maniak M. Rauchenberger R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Cell. 1995; 83: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar); thus these defects of cor− mutants strongly suggest that coronin plays a regulatory role in actin reorganization. We expect that Clipin members potentially share this regulatory role with coronin based on the close conservation of their structure (Fig. 1) and shared capability of actin binding (Fig. 3 and Refs. 5de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar and 12Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A recent study on Dictyostelium cells (16Gerisch G. Albrecht R. Heizer C. Hodgkinson S. Maniak M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1280-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) has provided two important clues for clarifying how coronin plays a regulatory role in F-actin dynamics: (i) In chemoattractant-stimulated cells, the temporal relationship between the coronin-green fluorescent protein accumulation and the appearance of a protrusion at a cell front (i.e.local actin rearrangement) was examined. Although the local accumulation of coronin-green fluorescent protein was seen 7 s after a protrusion became detectable on average, coronin-green fluorescent protein accumulation could precede the protrusion by 5 s at most (16Gerisch G. Albrecht R. Heizer C. Hodgkinson S. Maniak M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1280-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus coronin accumulation is not merely controlled by binding to a newly polymerized actin but may be regulated itself, at least in part. (ii) In coronin null mutants, the extended organelle-free zone, which appeared as a hyaline area, was formed at the front region, and more importantly, treatment with cytochalasin A, an actin-depolymerizing agent, partially rescued the wild-type phenotype (16Gerisch G. Albrecht R. Heizer C. Hodgkinson S. Maniak M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1280-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A third clue for the function of coronin/Clipins is provided by our present finding that ClipinC becomes accumulated at focal contacts. Furthermore, ClipinC was shown to bind to vinculin, which occurs in multimolecular complexes at focal adhesions. In collaboration with other cytoskeleton-membrane linking proteins, the accumulated Clipins/coronin at the cell front may possibly construct the molecular machinery that enables the movement of organelles into the front region. A similar mechanism elicited by ClipinC could be considered at neurite tips, accumulation sites of ClipinC in PC12 cells, because in neuronal growth cones, integrin clustering (17Schmidt C.E. Dai J. Lauffenburger D.A. Sheetz M.P. Horwitz A.F. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3400-3407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wu D.Y. Wang L.C. Mason C.A. Goldberg D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Grabham P.W. Goldberg D.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5455-5465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the accumulation of some components of focal adhesive complexes including vinculin, talin, and paxillin (8Varnum-Finney B. Reichart L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1071-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Leventhal P.S. Shelden E.A. Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5214-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) were observed following extracellular cues. In particular, the reduction of vinculin was shown to cause loss of growth cone stability and to reduce axonal growth in PC12 cells (8Varnum-Finney B. Reichart L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1071-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The involvement of ClipinC in this function of vinculin, i.e. stabilizing the nerve growth cone, is an intriguing possibility. A functional linkage of coronin with heterotrimeric or small G proteins has been considered. Mutant Dictyostelium cells devoid of Gβ subunits are unable to chemotax (21Wu L.J. Valkema R. Van Haastert P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and are impaired in their uptake of yeast particles (7Maniak M. Rauchenberger R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Cell. 1995; 83: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The involvement of coronin in chemoattractant-controlled cell locomotion (6de Hostos E.L. Rehfueß C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and in particle uptake (7Maniak M. Rauchenberger R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Cell. 1995; 83: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) suggests that coronin plays a role in signaling pathways downstream of the heterotrimeric G proteins. In mammalian cells including neuronal ones, G protein-coupled receptor stimulation is known to cause actin reorganization (2Zigmond S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 22Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that the small G proteins of the Rho family transmit signals from G protein-coupled receptors to the actin cytoskeleton (3Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar, 23Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). In organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, Rho subfamily members play an important role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in response to a broad spectrum of stimuli such as epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and phorbol myristic acetate (24Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 25Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar, 26Qiu R.-G. Hall A. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). It is tempting to assume the linkage between Rho subfamily and coronin/Clipins in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The coronin and Clipin family members are composed of three domains: an amino-terminal domain containing five WD repeats, an internal domain with a tendency to form an α-helical structure, and a highly divergent carboxyl-terminal domain (Fig. 1 and Refs. 5de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, and 13Zaphiropoulos P.G. Toftgård R. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; : 15Google Scholar). The WD repeat motif is thought to be capable of undergoing pairwise or multimeric interactions (27Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). The β subunits of G proteins, the best known proteins with WD repeats, act in signal transduction by forming multiprotein complexes through such repeats (28Garritsen A. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24418-24423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wang D.S. Shaw R. Winkelmann J.C. Shaw G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Pumiglia K.M. Le Vine H. Haske T. Habib T. Jove R. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14251-14254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, Gerisch et al. (16Gerisch G. Albrecht R. Heizer C. Hodgkinson S. Maniak M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1280-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) suggested that coronin binds not only to actin but also to other proteins and in this way couples regulatory proteins to the actin-myosin system; the same suggestion applies to the Clipin family molecules. The presumed α-helical domain was suggested to be important for actin binding (5de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In a ClipinC deletion mutant containing a WD domain only, in vitro F-actin binding was reduced to one-third of that by the intact ClipinC (data not shown). This may indicate the importance of ClipinC's internal α-helical domain for actin-binding, although the residual WD repeats can weakly associate with F-actin. Attention should be paid to the tissue-specific expressions of Clipin members, for their expression profiles were almost mutually exclusive. In marked contrast, the majority of cytoskeleton-membrane linking proteins, e.g. vinculin, paxillin, and ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family proteins, are ubiquitously expressed (9Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 14Takeuchi K. Sato N. Kasahara H. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Further, the expressions of the three members of the ERM family overlap nearly completely. It is an interesting possibility that the differential expressions of Clipin members may reflect a member-specific function in addition to the shared role in regulating actin organization. A recently reported interaction between p57/ClipinA and p40phox, a cytosolic component of the NADPH oxidase that generates microbicidal superoxide in phagocytes, may be related to the ClipinA-specific function (31Grogan A. Reeves E. Keep N. Wientjes F. Totty N.F. Burlingame A.L. Hsuan J.J. Segal A.W. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3071-3081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another exceptional characteristic of ClipinC as an actin-binding protein at the periphery of neuronal cells is that the protein was also detected along stress fibers in flattened SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 4A), because GAP-43 (32Benowitz L.I. Routtenberg A. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), MARCKS (33Ouimet C.C. Wang J.K. Walaas S.I. Albert K.A. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1683-1689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ERM family proteins (34Paglini G. Kunda P. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Cáceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), typical actin-regulating proteins in the growth cone, are known to be found at nerve terminals only. If ClipinC at the cell front functions as a connector between the actin cytoskeleton and the cortical membrane, ClipinC along stress fibers is unlikely to have the same function. Thus we may have to consider another role for ClipinC (or other Clipin members) residing along stress fibers. In fact, a homolog of coronin in yeast was recently reported to modulate actin filament assembly (35Goode B.L. Wong J.J. Butty A.-C. Peter M. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Guided neuronal migration in development and growth cone motility leading to neuronal plasticity are both controlled by cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons (36Rakic P. Cameron R.C. Komuro H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 37Lin C.-H. Thompson C.A. Forscher P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this respect, functional linkage between the intracellular cytoskeleton and extracellular substrates is a particularly important theme. As is important in other tissues (9Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar), cytoskeleton-cortical membrane linking complexes play a fundamental role in this process at the periphery of neurons. In the developing neocortical intermediate zone, the distribution of tangentially migrating neurons overlapped with that of intense immunoreactivity of ClipinC in neocortex (Fig. 2C) 1K. Takeuchi, T. Nakamura, H. Takezoe, N. Mori, and N. Takahashi, manuscript in preparation.; this may mean the involvement of ClipinC in the tangential cell migration in this area. Furthermore, we found that the overexpressed ClipinC had an effect on the cell attachment to the substrate.1 Our results provide a strong indication that ClipinC, a possible candidate for a cytoskeleton-membrane connector, is implicated in the control of cell adhesions and cell movements in neuronal cells.

A 6-kilobase NotI-SacI fragment of T. fuscaDNA containing the celR gene was cloned intoEsherichia coli and sequenced. The celR gene encodes a 340-residue polypeptide that is highly homologous to members of the GalR-LacI family of bacterial transcriptional regulators. CelR specifically binds to a 14-base pair inverted repeat, which has sequence similarity to the binding sites of other family members. This site is present in regions upstream of all six cellulase genes inT. fusca. The binding of CelR to the celEpromoter is inhibited specifically by low concentrations of cellobiose (0.2–0.5 mm), the major end product of cellulases. The other sugars tested did not affect binding at equivalent or 50-fold higher concentrations. The results suggest that CelR may act as a repressor, and that the mechanism of induction involves a direct interaction of CelR with cellobiose.

Biodegradation of cellulose by bacteria and fungi is accomplished by extracellular cellulolytic enzymes encoded by genes that are subject to transcriptional control. Several regulators of the transcription of cellulase genes in the cellulolytic filamentous fungus,Trichoderma reesei, including the activators ACE I and ACE II and the glucose repressor, Cre1, have been described (1Ilmen M. Thrane C. Penttila M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 451-460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Saloheimo A. Ilmen M. Aro N. Margolles-Clark E. Penttila M. Claeyssens M. Nerinckx W. Piens K. Carbohydrases from Trichoderma reesei and Other Microorganisms: Structures, Biochemistry, Genetics and Applications. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1998: 267-273Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of cellulase regulation in soil bacteria. The thermophilic actinomycete, Thermomonospora fusca, a major degrader of cellulose in plant residues, is an extensively studied cellulolytic bacterium. This species produces six different extracellular cellulases, designated E1 through E6. Three of the enzymes (E1, E2, and E5) are endocellulases, two are exocellulases (E3 and E6), and one enzyme possesses both exo- and endocellulolytic activity (E4). The major product of these enzymes is cellobiose (3Irwin D. Walker L. Spezio M. Wilson D. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1993; 42: 1002-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4Barr B.K. Hsieh Y.-L.

Biol. 1997; 4: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of cellulases in T. fusca is regulated by cellobiose induction and catabolite repression, with any readily metabolized sugar acting as a repressor (6Lin E. Wilson D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 53: 1352-1357Google Scholar). The lowest level of cellulase synthesis (3 nm) was observed with xylose as a carbon source, and the highest level was found in cultures grown on microcrystalline cellulose. Endocellulases and exocellulases showed distinctly different regulation patterns, with exocellulases showing the highest level of induction (7Spiridonov N.A. Wilson D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structural genes for all these enzymes, designated celAthrough celE (8Jung E.D. Lao G. Irwin D. Barr B.K. Benjamin A. Wilson D.B.

Irwin, unpublished results. have been cloned and sequenced. All six cellulase genes in T. fuscacontain the 14-bp inverted repeat sequence TGGGAGCGCTCCCA in their 5′-upstream regions. A regulatory protein that interacts with the upstream regions of cel genes was detected in T. fusca cultures grown on cellulose. The binding site was identified as the 14-bp inverted repeat by DNase I footprinting of thecelE gene and by chemical footprinting of thecelB gene (11Lin E. Wilson D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3843-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wilson D.B. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1992; 12: 45-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The same palindrome was found in the regulatory regions of cellulase genes from different streptomycetes, in particular, the cenC gene from Streptomycesstrain KSM9 (13Nakai R. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the celA genes from Streptomyces halstedii (14Fernandez-Abalos J.M. Sanchez P. Coll P.M. Villanueva J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6368-6376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Streptomyces lividans (15Theberge M. Lacaze P. Shareck F. Morosoli R. Kluepfel D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 815-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and also in the cel1 gene from Streptomyces reticuli (16Schlochtermeier A. Walter S. Schroeder J. Moorman M. Schrempf H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3611-3621Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), where it serves as the operator for a repressor protein (17Walter S. Schrempf H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 186-195PubMed Google Scholar). The same sequence was also found in a xylanase gene from Thermomonospora alba (18Blanco J. Coque J.J.R. Velasco J. Martin J.F. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 48: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The occurrence of this site in cellulase and xylanase genes from different species may indicate its special role in regulating carbohydrate catabolism in streptomycetes and other high GC Gram-positive bacteria. Here we report the isolation and properties of CelR, a regulatory protein from T. fusca that specifically binds to the 14-bp inverted repeat site in cellulase genes, as well as the complete nucleotide sequence of the celR gene. T. fusca ER1 is an extracellular protease-negative strain derived from T. fusca YX (12Wilson D.B. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1992; 12: 45-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain DH5α (19Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8097) Google Scholar) was used for cloning and plasmid isolation. Plasmid pE5-46 has been described previously (3Irwin D. Walker L. Spezio M. Wilson D. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1993; 42: 1002-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Plasmid pNS1 was constructed as described below. T. fusca was grown on Hagerdahl medium (20Hagerdahl B.G.R. Ferchak J.D. Pye E.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1978; 36: 606-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5% Solka Floc (microcrystalline cellulose, James River Corp.). E. colistrains containing recombinant plasmids were grown in Luria broth or plated on Luria agar plates containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid pE5-46 fromE. coli strain D541, which contained thecelE gene from T. fusca (3Irwin D. Walker L. Spezio M. Wilson D. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1993; 42: 1002-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) was cut withEcoRI, SalI, and XhoI, and the 3′ ends of the fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP or [α-32P]dATP, using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The following 32P-labeled pE5-46 fragments were present in the reaction mixture: a high mobility 548-bp fragment (containing the celE promoter and regulatory region), a low motility 2656-bp fragment (containing the pE5-46 promoters), and a 1428-bp fragment (containing the coding region of the celEgene). Binding was carried out in 15–20 μl of 40 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmDTT, 2The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol, PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 3 ng of 32P-labeled fragments, T. fusca extract (1–6 μg of protein), 10 μg/ml poly(dG-dC), and 12.5% glycerol. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, samples were electrophoresed through a 1.2% agarose gel in 90 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 3 mm EDTA. Gels were dried at 80 °C under vacuum and radioautographed. The extent of binding to the celE regulatory region was estimated from dilutions that yielded 25–75% conversion of the DNA fragment to the slower mobility DNA-protein complex. One unit of celEpromoter binding activity is the amount of DNA-binding protein that converts 50% of the DNA fragment to a DNA-protein complex under the assay conditions. T. fusca strain ER1 was grown in 10 liters of Hagerdahl medium (20Hagerdahl B.G.R. Ferchak J.D. Pye E.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1978; 36: 606-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.5% Solka Floc and 2 g of yeast extract at 52 °C (pH 7.2 at 40% oxygen saturation). Cells were harvested after 15 h of cultivation, sedimented and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mmDTT. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C, unless otherwise noted. Cells were lysed with a French press, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 25 min. Streptomycin sulfate (4%) was added to the supernatant, and the DNA precipitate was removed after 1 h by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 25 min. Sodium chloride (0.5 m) was added, and the supernatant (700 ml) was loaded on a 200-ml phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted successively with 0.5 m, 20 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, the same buffer without NaCl, and with distilled water. Fractions eluted with distilled water (150 ml) were applied to a 40-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm DTT (buffer A). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.1 to 1.5 m (400 ml). Appropriate fractions (120 ml) were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and loaded on a 7-ml DNA-Sepharose column that contained DNA fragments with multiple copies of the 14-bp inverted repeat (TGGGAGCGCTCCCA) coupled to Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA affinity chromatography was performed in buffer A at room temperature. After washing with 25 ml of buffer A, the column was successively eluted with 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 m NaCl in buffer A. Electrophoretically pure (>95%) CelR protein was eluted with 10 ml of warm (50 °C) 1.8m NaCl, concentrated, and desalted using Centricon-30 concentrators. Protein was determined with the BCA reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. The molecular weight of CelR was determined by 12% SDS-PAGE (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar) using low and high molecular weight protein standards (Sigma). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma). Duplicate gels were cut into 2-mm sections and washed successively with 50% isopropanol, 10% isopropanol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mmEDTA. Gel sections were homogenized in the same buffer, and protein was extracted overnight at 4 °C. DNA binding activity in gel extracts was measured as described. The molecular weight of native CelR was determined by HPLC gel chromatography. A Waters Protein Pak 200SW glass column (8 mm × 30 cm) was equilibrated and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl at 15 ml/h. The column was calibrated with gel chromatography protein standards (Bio-Rad). Purified CelR (28 μg in 200 μl) was applied to the column, and fractions of 0.25 ml were collected and assayed for celE-promoter binding activity. The effect of sugars on the CelR-DNA interaction was measured by gel retardation experiments using purified CelR with the conditions described above. Sugars (0.1–100 mm) were introduced into the reaction mixture prior to the addition of CelR (10–90 pg/μl). Purified CelR was cleaved with endo-lys-C, and the products of digestion were separated by HPLC. The N-terminal sequence of CelR and an internal peptide were determined on an Applied Biosystems model 492 automated protein sequencer at the BioResource Center, New York State Center for Advanced Technology (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). An internal standard peptide was included in all sequencing runs in order to independently verify the performance of the sequencer. Genomic DNA was isolated from a 125-ml T. fusca culture grown for 24 h on 0.5% cellobiose. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (8,000 rpm, 15 min), frozen, thawed, and resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm EDTA at 4 °C. SDS (1%), and 0.8 ml of diethyl pyrocarbonate were added. Cells were French pressed at 5,000 p.s.i. directly into 35 ml of phenol:chlorophorm:isoamyl alcohol mixture (25:24:1) on ice. The lysate was mixed and centrifuged (8,000 rpm, 15 min), and the water phase was treated with phenol three more times. Then the water phase was consecutively extracted with a chlorophorm:isoamyl alcohol mixture (24:1) and with ether. DNA was precipitated from the water phase on ice with 0.3 m NaCl and 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol, spooled on a glass rod, washed in cold ethanol, and redissolved in 1.5 ml of TE buffer (pH 8.0) overnight. Degenerate sets of 15-mer oligonucleotides GC(C/G/T)GT(C/G)ATCAACGGC encoding the N-terminal region of the CelR protein from Arg25 to Gly29, and GA(G/A)AACAACCAGAA(G/A), complementary to the strand encoding the internal part of the protein from Glu73 to Lys77 were synthesized by the BioResource Center, Cornell University. Oligonucleotides were labeled with fluorescein by the 3′-tailing reaction with terminal transferase. Total genomic DNA fromT. fusca was completely digested with NotI and SacI, electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel, Southern blotted into a Hybond N+ membrane (Millipore), and hybridized with fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides. The 3′-oligolabeling and signal amplification system for the FluorImager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in the hybridization experiments. A 6-kb DNA fragment that hybridized to both oligonucleotide probes was visualized with a STORM 840 scanner and the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). Fragments of ∼6 kb were isolated from aNotI-SacI complete digest of genomic DNA separated on a 0.7% agarose gel and purified with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The DNA was ligated to pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) digested with the same restriction enzymes. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli strain DH5α, and the cells were plated on LB ampicillin plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl b-d-galactopyranoside and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformants were screened by hybridization of E. colicolonies on Hybond N+ membrane with a fluorescein-labeled probe, as described. Plasmid DNA was purified from positive transformants with a plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen), digested with NotI and SacI, electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gel, Southern blotted into Hybond N+ membrane, and hybridized with both fluorescein-labeled probes, as described. Plasmid DNA from one of the clones that carried a 6-kb insert which hybridized with both oligonucleotide probes was called pNS1. Double-stranded DNA from pNS1 was used as a template for sequencing the celR structural gene and its 3′- and 5′-flanking regions. The sequences of both strands were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52237) Google Scholar) at the BioResource Center, Cornell University. The two degenerate 15-mer oligonucleotides were used to determine the initial nucleotide sequences. Specific primers for sequencing the celR gene were synthesized by the BioResource Center. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST programs (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58724) Google Scholar) were used for searching for sequence homologies in the GenBank and SwissProt data bases. The Pfam HMM program 3The Pfam HMM program is available via the World Wide Web (http://pfam.wustl.edu/hmmsearch.shtml). was used for creating alignment with the GalR/LacI family. Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp.) was used for analysis and assembling DNA sequencing data. Calculations of codon usage, molecular weight, isoelectric point, and hydrophobicity of the protein product were made with DNASTAR Lasergene software. T. fusca cultures grown on microcrystalline cellulose possessed considerable celE promoter binding activity (Fig. 1). Preliminary experiments showed that the maximum level of activity was observed after 12–24 h of cultivation, and that the levels of binding activity remained high during an additional 48 h of cultivation. Cells grown on non-inducing carbon sources had insignificant celE promoter binding activity (data not shown). Reduced motility of the high molecular weight DNA fragment containing the E. coli plasmid promoters was also observed (Fig. 1,lanes 2–4). However, it was independent of the carbon source used to grow T. fusca. Presumably, the reduced motility of the high molecular weight fragment was due to the interaction of RNA polymerase from T. fusca present in the crude extract with plasmid promoters from pE5-46. No shift was detected for the 1428-bp DNA fragment, which contained no promoter elements. The CelR protein was purified from 10 liters of T. fusca culture by three chromatographic steps. The process of purification was followed by the gel retardation assay, Lowry protein measurement (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SDS-PAGE (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar). A purification summary is presented in TableI. Purification yielded highly active protein of greater that 95% purity (Fig. 2). The resulting CelR bound only to the DNA fragment containing the celE promoter (Fig. 1).Table IPurification of the CelR regulatory protein from T. fuscaFractionVolumeTotal proteinTotal activityYieldSpecific activityPurificationmlmgunit × 103%unit/mg × 103-foldCrude extract6503,12013,0001004.21Phenyl-Sepharose1501176,0004651.312Heparin-Sepharose120234,8003721050DNA affinity-Sepharose120.1052401.82,290547 Open table in a new tab The molecular mass of pure CelR protein as determined by SDS-PAGE is 41 ± 1.5 kDa. Samples of partially purified and pure CelR were separated with SDS-PAGE, and the gels were cut into 2-mm sections. Protein was eluted from each section, renatured, and tested for DNA binding activity. In each case the binding activity was associated with the 41-kDa band (data not shown). Estimation of the native molecular weight of purified CelR with HPLC gel chromatography showed that the protein aggregated under non-denaturing conditions. About 3% of CelR came off the column as a dimer (70–85 kDa), a tetramer (145–175 kDa), and an octamer (250–400 kDa). The major part of the protein formed high molecular weight aggregates that could not be resolved by HPLC. Only traces of CelR monomer were found. The dissociation constant was calculated as the concentration of CelR that caused 50% of the DNA to form a complex with the protein under the described conditions. The apparent K d for the CelR-celE promoter complex in the absence of cellobiose was 0.5–1 × 10−9m. The binding of CelR to the celE promoter region was inhibited by cellobiose at concentrations of 0.2–0.5 mm and higher (Fig. 3). The apparent dissociation constant for cellobiose was 5 × 10−4m, as measured in gel retardation experiments under the above conditions with 75 pg/μl CelR. The effect of cellobiose on the dissociation constant of the CelR-celE promoter complex is shown on Fig. 4. A 500-fold increase in cellobiose concentration (from 0.1 to 50 mm) resulted in a 7-fold increase in K d for the CelR-celE promoter complex. At the same time, equivalent or higher concentrations of other tested sugars did not affect binding. Cellotriose, sophorose, and xylobiose showed little inhibition at 50 mm. Other mono- and disaccharides (glucose, galactose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, sucrose, lactose, and maltose) had no effect on binding even at 100 mm (data not shown).Figure 4The effect of cellobiose on the dissociation constant of CelR-celE promoter complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N terminus and an internal region of CelR were sequenced. Two degenerate oligonucleotides prepared on the basis of reverse translation of the amino acid sequence were used to select E. coli clones. About 200 E. coli transformants from a NotI-SacI library were screened. Six transformants contained plasmid DNA with a 6-kb insert that hybridized with the two different oligonucleotide probes. Plasmid DNA (pNS1) from one of the positive clones was used as a template for sequencing. The DNA insert contained a three-cistron operon bglABC coding for two sugar permeases and a β-glucosidase, 4N. A. Spiridonov, unpublished results. and celR, coding for the regulatory protein. Both strands were sequenced, and the sequence of celR is shown in Fig. 5. The celR gene has a G+C content of 68%, which is similar to the 65% G+C content of T. fusca DNA (9Lao G. Ghangas G.S. Jung E.D. Wilson D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3397-3407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A reading frame from nucleotide 109 to nucleotide 1128 encodes a 340-amino acid moderately hydrophobic protein (125 hydrophobic amino acids). The molecular weight of CelR, inferred from its amino acid sequence, is 36,863 daltons, lower than its apparent molecular weight determined by SDS-PAGE. The reading frame that codes for CelR has a high content of G and C (85.6%) in the third positions of the codons, typical for cellulase genes from T. fusca(8Jung E.D. Lao G. Irwin D. Barr B.K. Benjamin A. Wilson D.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3032-3043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lao G. Ghangas G.S. Jung E.D. Wilson D.B. J.

The N-terminal (first 37 amino acids) and an internal (amino acids 60–77) sequence of the protein read from the nucleotide sequence of the celR gene are identical to the N-terminal sequence of CelR protein and the sequence of its endo-lys-C cleavage product, as determined with the protein sequencer. A potential ribosome binding site (GGAA) is located 5 bases upstream of the start codon. The 5′-regulatory region of celR contains an inverted repeat that may act as a transcription terminator for thebglC gene whose termination codon is located 108 nucleotides upstream of the celR start codon. A putative transcription terminator sequence for the celR gene (a 21-base palindrome) is located immediately downstream of its structural region. It is interesting to note that the reverse strand of thecelR gene contains a 1008-nucleotide open reading frame that begins with GTG start codon (nucleotides 1140–1138) and terminates with TAG (nucleotides 135–133). A putative ribosome-binding site (AGG) is located 5 nucleotides upstream from the start codon. The hypothetical 335-amino acid protein product is 23% identical to a putative ATP/GTP-binding protein from Streptomyces coelicolor, AL031225. The amino acid sequence of CelR has been scanned against the GenBank and EMBL data bases. CelR shares significant homology with a number of proteins that belong to the GalR-LacI family of bacterial transcriptional regulators. It is 49% identical to a transcriptional regulator from S. coelicolor(e1309425), 36% identical to a ribose operon repressor RbsR fromE. coli (P25551), 32% identical to a transcriptional repressor CytR from E. coli (P06964), a transcriptional regulator DegA from Bacillus subtilis (e1173517), and a ribose operon repressor RbsR from Haemophilus influenzae(P44329), 30% identical to a galactose operon repressor GalR (P03024), a maltose repressor MalI (M60722), and a sucrose operon repressor CscR (P40715) from E. coli, 29% identical to the lactose repressor from E. coli (P03023) and to many other members of the family. The N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, located between amino acids 8 and 29, is the most conserved part of the CelR protein. It is 65% identical and 80% similar to the GalR-LacI consensus (Fig. 6). An unusual feature of CelR is a cluster of four consecutive arginine residues near the N terminus that is followed by proline and threonine (amino acids 3–8). This may represent a phosphorylation site for a cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (26Glass D.B. el-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2987-2993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Location of this site at the boundary of the DNA-binding motif may indicate its involvement in regulation of DNA-protein interactions. The amino acid sequence (residues 205–210, 256–260, and 282–285) of CelR also shares some homology with elements of the sugar binding sites of the GalR/LacI proteins (27Weickert M.J. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15869-15874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Markiewicz P. Kleina L.G. Cruz C. Ehret S. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A functionally active DNA-binding protein that interacts specifically with the 5′-regulatory region of the celE gene was isolated from T. fusca grown on microcrystalline cellulose. CelR did not bind to the E. coli promoters in pE5-46 or to the coding region of the celE gene; it bound tightly to the celE promoter. Sequence similarities showed that CelR belongs to the GalR-LacI family of transcriptional regulators. The GalR-LacI regulators bind to their target DNA sites as homodimers, and their operator sequences are inverted repeats. Each monomer of a homodimer interacts with its half of an operator sequence with an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that contains a characteristic helix-turn-helix motif (27Weickert M.J. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15869-15874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CelR protein shares a number of common features with other members of this family. CelR possesses a typical DNA binding domain, based on sequence comparison, and its binding site is similar to operator sites for the lactose repressor LacI from E. coli, the amylase repressor CcpA from Bacillus subtilis, and some other members of the GalR-LacI family (Table II). Unlike other GalR-LacI proteins that form dimers and tetramers, CelR, because of its hydrophobicity, shows strong aggregation under non-denaturing conditions.Table IIDNA binding half-sites for CelR and other bacterial regulators of the GalR-LacI family (27Weickert M.J.

Open table in a new tab The 5′ regulatory regions of all known cellulase genes in T. fusca contain from one to three copies of this sequence (7Spiridonov N.A. Wilson D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, all six cel genes in T. fusca are under transcriptional control of the CelR protein. Apparently, cellulase regulation in T. fusca follows the general design of transcriptional control of genes encoding enzymes for carbohydrate catabolism in other eubacteria. In particular, it resembles the regulatory system of the amylase and chitinase genes in S. lividans that are controlled by Reg1, a member of the GalR/LacI family, that acts as a positive regulator of chitinase genes under inducing conditions, or as a negative regulator of α-amylase and chitinase production in the presence of glucose (29Nguyen J. Francou F. Virolle M.-J. Guerieau M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6383-6390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar toreg1, which is not adjacent to the α-amylase genes inS. lividans controlled by reg1, celRis not adjacent to any of the T. fusca cellulase genes. Cellulase regulation in T. fusca is different from regulation of cellulase genes in the fungus T. reesei, although the two evolutionally distant species possess similar cellulolytic enzyme systems (30Wilson D.B. Irwin D. Recent Progress in Bioconversion of Lignocellulosics. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). In T. reesei, the cellulase genes are controlled by the transcriptional activators ACE I and ACE II and a glucose repressor Cre1 belonging to the family of Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins (1Ilmen M. Thrane C. Penttila M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 451-460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Saloheimo A. Ilmen M. Aro N. Margolles-Clark E. Penttila M. Claeyssens M. Nerinckx W. Piens K. Carbohydrases from Trichoderma reesei and Other Microorganisms: Structures, Biochemistry, Genetics and Applications. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1998: 267-273Google Scholar). The vast majority of proteins of the GalR/LacI family bind carbohydrate or nucleoside effectors (27Weickert M.J. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15869-15874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that the DNA binding activity of CelR is modulated by cellobiose. Results of in vitro experiments explain the literature data on the induction of cellulase production in T. fusca cultures by cellobiose (6Lin E. Wilson D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 53: 1352-1357Google Scholar,7Spiridonov N.A. Wilson D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that low physiological levels of cellobiose (0.2–0.5 mm) are sufficient for dissociation of the CelR-celE promoter complex in vitro is evidence that cellobiose is the true inducer of the cel genes, and that the mechanism of induction involves a direct interaction of CelR with cellobiose. In the absence of cellobiose, CelR presumably forms complexes with the 14-bp inverted repeats next to the celgenes and blocks their transcription. However, a very low constitutive level of cellulase synthesis (about 3 nm) was observed even when cells were grown on non-inducing sugars (7Spiridonov N.A. Wilson D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When cellulose is present in the environment, cellobiose resulting from its digestion enters cells and form complexes with CelR, allowing transcription to proceed. As cellobiose in the cells is exhausted, CelR likely represses transcription. This simple mechanism may allow quick adaptation of cells to changing environments, improve the efficiency of thecel regulon, and help avoid the unnecessary production of extracellular enzymes. The occurrence of the 14-bp inverted repeat in the upstream regions of cel genes from differentStreptomyces species (13Nakai R. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Fernandez-Abalos J.M. Sanchez P. Coll P.M. Villanueva J.R. J.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3611-3621Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggests that this regulatory mechanism may be also shared by other cellulase genes. One result that is not explained by this model is the absence of active CelR protein in cells grown without cellulose or cellobiose. The mechanism of cellulase regulation in T. fusca under non-inducing conditions requires further investigation.

Cell. 1994; 78: 547-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar).

This family of growth factors act primarily through high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs) (11Givol D. Yayon A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3362-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), although in addition their activity is modulated by lower affinity heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan receptors (12Rapraeger A.C.

Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which this occurs is far from understood. The FGFR family comprises four related molecules, which each contain a highly conserved tyrosine kinase domain (15Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), further diversity being provided by the existence of alternatively spliced isoforms (15Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv.

Intracellular signaling is believed to be initiated by receptor dimerization and receptor transphosphorylation (18Bellot F. Crumley G. Kaplow J.M. Schlessinger J. Jaye M. Dionne C.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2849-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Ueno H. Gunn M. Dell K. Tseng Jr., A. Williams L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1470-1476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, signaling without receptor dimerization cannot be ruled out, as it has not yet been shown whether FGFRs are activated in their monomeric forms. Indeed it has been suggested that bFGF activates multiple signaling pathways by utilizing either monomeric FGFRs or FGFR dimers/multimers (20Krufka A. Guimond S. Rapraeger A.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11131-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

The investigations described above have led to a number of models being proposed by which HS·bFGF·FGFR interact to bring about a biological response. These include the simultaneous binding of two bFGF molecules to a HS oligosaccharide sequence within the HS chain so as to present bFGF dimers to the FGFRs, thereby enabling two high affinity FGFRs to be brought into close proximity to one another for receptor dimerization and transphosphorylation (14Ornitz D.M.

An alternative HS·bFGF monomer model has been suggested, in which HS acts as a bridge by simultaneously binding single molecules of bFGF and FGFR to form a signaling complex (25Kan M. Wang F. Xu J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another HS·bFGF monomeric model has also been proposed, in which a monomeric complex of HS and bFGF facilitates receptor dimerization through two FGFR-binding interfaces on the growth factor (26Pantoliano M.W.

Other models have also been proposed, with complexes as large as bFGF tetramers being implicated as an active complex (40Moy F.J. Safran M. Seddon A.P. Kitchen D. Bohlen P. Aviezer D. Yayon A. Powers R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4782-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), as in cytokines such as interferon γ and platelet factor 4 (41Mayo K.H. Chen M.J.

However, conditions used to observe these complexes differ considerably from the component ratios found to be active in cell assay systems. One of the major issues still to be resolved in the bFGF mitogenic signaling mechanism is the exact nature of the signaling complex and, in particular, the stoichiometry of the HS·bFGF complex. In this study, we have produced novel covalently cross-linked conjugates of bFGF and HS oligosaccharides, which no longer bind any further HS but are fully active biologically. These conjugates have enabled us to determine the minimal bFGF·HS oligosaccharide stoichiometry required for initiating mitogenic activity. Horse serum and RPMI medium were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Biocult, Paisley, United Kingdom (UK)). BaF3 (clone F32) and WEHI 3b cells were supplied by the Klagsbrun Laboratory (Boston, MA). Human recombinant bFGF was supplied by R&D Systems (Abingdon, Oxon, UK). Porcine mucosal HS was obtained from Organon (Oss, The Netherlands). Heparinase III (Flavobacterium heparinum; EC 4.2.2.8) was obtained from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK). EDC and S-NHS were supplied by Pierce (Chester, UK). Bovine serum albumin, MES, Tween 20, and rabbit anti-human bFGF antibody were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG antibody was supplied by Dako (Cambridge, UK). ECL reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK). [methyl 3H]Thymidine was supplied by NEN Life Science Products (Hounslow, UK). Superose 12 columns were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (St. Albans, Herts, UK). Bio-Gel P6 was supplied by Bio-Rad (Hemel Hempstead, Herts, UK). Microscint O was obtained from Packard (Pangbourne, Berks, UK). All other reagents were obtained from BDH-Merk Ltd (Lutterworth, Leics, UK) and were of AnalaR grade. 100 mg of porcine mucosal HS in 0.5 ml of heparinase buffer (100 mmsodium acetate, 0.1 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0), was incubated initially with 0.25 IU of heparinase III followed by two further additions after 24 and 48 h. The digest was monitored by absorbance at 232 nm until no further increase occurred. Oligosaccharides produced by heparinase III digestion were then resolved using a Bio-Gel P6 column (1.5 × 170 cm) in 0.5m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 6 ml/h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and oligosaccharides detected by monitoring the absorbance at 232 nm. Size-defined oligosaccharides dp2–16 were pooled, freeze-dried, and stored at −80 °C until required. Cross-linking was carried out essentially as described previously by Grabarek and Gergely (43Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar); however, conditions were chosen so as to optimize yields of cross-linked products. Briefly, for preparative reactions, dp12 oligosaccharides in coupling buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 0.1m MES, pH 6.0) were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C with 6 mm EDC and 15 mm S-NHS. The reaction was terminated by addition of β-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 20 mm. Activated oligosaccharides were then added to a 50 μm solution of bFGF in coupling buffer, to give a bFGF:dp12 molar ratio of 1:4 and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. Products were analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and Western blotting, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) immunodetection prior to purification. Western blots of SDS-PAGE gels on nitrocellulose membranes were blocked overnight with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS and then washed three times with PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. The membrane was then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti human bFGF monoclonal antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibody solution was then removed and the membrane washed three times with PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. The membrane was then further incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. The membrane was then finally washed eight times in succession with PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and the presence of bFGF visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cross-linked samples were applied to two coupled Superose 12 columns linked to a Gilson HPLC system, equilibrated in 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 2.0 m NaCl, pH 7.4. Samples were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, fractions (250 μl) were collected, and elution profile monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions containing protein were desalted by microdialysis (M r cut-off 12,000) against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min overnight at 4 °C. Desalted samples were analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting and ECL immunodetection. Fractions containing cross-linked products were pooled and reapplied to the columns and the procedure repeated as above. Finally, purified components were lyophilized and stored at −80 °C until required. BaF3 cells transfected with FGFR1 (designated F32 cells) (14Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% horse serum supplemented with interleukin-3 conditioned medium (prepared from WEHI 3b cells) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For the assay system, F32 cells were plated into 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium, 10% horse serum supplemented with cross-linked conjugates. Cells were incubated for 46 h before addition of [3H]thymidine (0.3 μCi/well) for another 2 h. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was stopped by harvesting cells on a Filtermate-196 cell harvester. Cells were allowed to air-dry before addition of 25 μl of Microscint O to each well, and incorporated radioactivity counted on a top count system. The assay was performed using a membrane filtration apparatus (Millipore, Watford, Herts, UK). Briefly, 4 μg of bFGF or bFGF·HS complex was applied to the filter in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3). Filters were then washed with 10 ml of 2.0 m NaCl to remove any non-cross-linked oligosaccharide that may have been present, and then re-equilibrated by washing with binding buffer. Metabolically labeled endothelial cell [3H]HS, prepared as described previously (44Pye D.A. Kumar S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), was applied in 5 ml of binding buffer and cycled through the filter three times. Filters were then washed twice with 5 ml of binding buffer to remove unbound [3H]HS. Bound [3H]HS was then removed from the growth factor by washing, first with three 5-ml aliquots of 0.3 m NaCl, followed by further washing with three 5-ml aliquots of 2.0m NaCl in binding buffer. Fractions (5 ml) were collected and eluted material quantified by scintillation counting. In order to produce potentially active HS oligosaccharide·bFGF conjugates, we have employed a specific method of zero length cross-linking. As no spacer is introduced using this method, cross-linking should only occur between the oligosaccharide and amino acid side chains within the actual HS binding site of bFGF. The cross-linking process is a two-step procedure, initially involving a brief incubation of HS oligosaccharide with EDC in the presence of NHS. This results in the conversion of some of the oligosaccharide carboxyls into succinimide esters. This oligosaccharide activation reaction is then terminated by neutralizing the EDC with β-mercaptoethanol prior to addition of growth factor. Cross-linking arises from the reaction of the succinimide esters with the lysine ε-amino groups of the growth factor. A two-step process has the advantage that only the oligosaccharide comes into contact with the active cross-linking reagents; hence, only oligosaccharide protein cross-links are formed. This eliminates possible complications arising from protein-protein cross-linking, which could perturb further interaction of the conjugates with FGFRs. Preliminary experiments were carried out using the zero length cross-linking procedure, in order to assess the type of conjugates formed and to optimize the yield of products. Oligosaccharides of six disaccharides in length (dp12) were chosen, as these have previously been shown to be the minimum size saccharide fragments that have maximal bFGF stimulating activity, when compared with intact chains (31Guimond S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 931-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows an SDS-PAGE and ECL immunodetection analysis of native bFGF (approximate mass of 18 kDa) and the products obtained by cross-linking of dp12 oligosaccharides to bFGF. It can be seen that the products of cross-linking include both dimer (CL-dp12·bFGF dimer) and monomer (CL-dp12·bFGF monomer) conjugates of oligosaccharide and growth factor. Increasing the ratio of oligosaccharide to growth factor resulted in higher yields of both CL-dp12·bFGF monomers and CL-dp12·bFGF dimers, with the most striking increase seen with the CL-dp12·bFGF monomers. However, the majority of the growth factor remained in the native form. This is most likely due to a combination of the half-life of the active oligosaccharide esters being only 1–2 h, and the slow off-rate of the oligosaccharide when bound to the growth factor. Control experiments in the absence of cross-linking reagents showed no conjugate bands and no increase in disulfide-bonded bFGF dimers (Fig. 1A,lanes 1 and 2). In order to optimize yields of CL-dp12·bFGF dimers and CL-dp12·bFGF monomers within a single reaction, the ratio of bFGF:dp12 oligosaccharide was varied from 4:1 to 1:32 (results not shown). Additionally, the ratio of EDC to S-NHS has been shown to effect coupling efficiency (43Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar); in light of this, the ratio of EDC:S-NHS was also varied (results not shown). As a result of these experiments, optimal cross-linking conditions for production of both monomer and dimer conjugates were chosen to be a 1:4 ratio of bFGF:dp12 and EDC/S-NHS concentrations of 6/15 mm,respectively. A typical distribution of reaction products is shown in Fig. 1B. The lack of cross-linked product when denatured bFGF was used (results not shown) ruled out the possibility of the process being the result of nonspecific random collision of active oligosaccharide-succinimide esters and primary amines on the growth factor. Products of the cross-linking reaction were separated by gel-filtration chromatography using two Superose 12 columns connected in series, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and a typical elution profile is shown in Fig. 2A. This clearly shows the conjugates (56–61 min) eluting prior to the free oligosaccharide (62–65 min as identified previously by absorbance at 232 nm), and much earlier than the native growth factor (results not shown) (73–76 min for native bFGF disulfide dimer and 77–80 min for the native bFGF monomer). This early elution of bFGF conjugates (just prior to free dp12 oligosaccharide) may be due to the rigid extended nature of the oligosaccharide dominating the conjugate's hydrodynamic shape. In previous work (results not shown), we have noticed that, due to the strength of the binding of oligosaccharide to bFGF, non-cross-linked complexes of bFGF and oligosaccharide also elute at a position just prior to the free oligosaccharide peak. This indicates that the cross-linked conjugates resemble at least in size/shape non-cross-linked dp12·bFGF oligosaccharide complexes. Indeed examination of the fractions by SDS-PAGE and ECL immunodetection, showed some contamination of the conjugates by both native bFGF disulfide dimer and monomer (Fig. 2B) as a result of the strong native bFGF·dp12 interaction described above. In order to finally remove all traces of free growth factor from the samples, fractions containing CL-dp12·bFGF dimers and CL-dp12·bFGF monomers were pooled separately and reapplied to the Superose 12 column in the presence of 2 m NaCl. This resulted in the recovery of conjugates with no free growth factor (by SDS-PAGE) or oligosaccharide contamination (as detected by absorbance at 232 nm results not shown). Fig. 3A shows a typical Superose 12 elution profile for the CL-dp12·bFGF monomer conjugate, with SDS-PAGE and ECL immunodetection analysis (Fig. 3B) confirming the absence of native growth factor. Purification of the CL-dp12·bFGF dimer conjugates was found to require several additional cycles of gel filtration in order to obtain an homogeneous preparation.Figure 3Purification of CL-dp12·bFGF monomer conjugates.

These were: 1) individual cross-linking of two separate bFGF molecules to a single oligosaccharide, as may expected in the case of the dimer activation model which has been previously proposed (14Ornitz D.M.

To clarify this, we ran non-reduced and reduced samples of the CL-dp12·bFGF dimer conjugate on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). This clearly shows that the dimer product consists of disulfide-bridged CL-dp12·bFGF monomers. Initial experiments also showed that small amounts of hybrid disulfide dimers were formed, which degraded to CL-dp12·bFGF monomers and unmodified bFGF monomers on reduction. However, more extensively purified dimer preparations such as that used in Fig. 4 were devoid of these hybrids. The fact that no true cross-linked dimer (two bFGFs to one dp12 oligosaccharide) is formed provides evidence that the binding of two bFGF molecules to a single oligosaccharide via identical growth factor binding sites is not an accurate model for the activation of signal transduction by HS·bFGF. As a result of this experiment, only the CL-dp12·bFGF monomer conjugate remained as a potential minimal mitogenic activation complex. The BaF3 cells are a lymphoblastoid line that do not express FGFRs and fail to respond to bFGF. These cells were transfected with FGFR1 to produce the F32 cell clone. The F32 cells, which are devoid of functional cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, will respond to bFGF only in the presence of exogenous heparin or HS (14Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G.

https://openalex.org/W2091661940,"In eukaryotes, two isozymes (I and II) of methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) catalyze the removal of the initiator methionine if the penultimate residue has a small radius of gyration (glycine, alanine, serine, threonine, proline, valine, and cysteine). Using site-directed mutagenesis, recombinant yeast MetAP I derivatives that are able to cleave N-terminal methionine from substrates that have larger penultimate residues have been expressed. A Met to Ala change at 329 (Met206 in Escherichia coli enzyme) produces an average catalytic efficiency 1.5-fold higher than the native enzyme on normal substrates and cleaves substrates containing penultimate asparagine, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, and phenylalanine. Interestingly, the native enzyme also has significant activity with the asparagine peptide not previously identified as a substrate. Mutation of Gln356 (Gln233 inE. coli MetAP) to alanine results in a catalytic efficiency about one-third that of native with normal substrates but which can cleave methionine from substrates with penultimate histidine, asparagine, glutamine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. Mutation of Ser195 to alanine had no effect on substrate specificity. None of the altered enzymes produced cleaved substrates with a fully charged residue (lysine, arginine, aspartic acid, or glutamic acid) or tyrosine in the penultimate position."
https://openalex.org/W2145064110,"Abstract This paper reports the first site-directed mutagenesis analysis of any cytochrome c 6, a heme protein that performs the same function as the copper-protein plastocyanin in the electron transport chain of photosynthetic organisms. Photosystem I reduction by the mutants of cytochromec 6 from the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been studied by laser flash absorption spectroscopy. Their kinetic efficiency and thermodynamic properties have been compared with those of plastocyanin mutants from the same organism. Such a comparative study reveals that aspartates at positions 70 and 72 in cytochrome c 6 are located in an acidic patch that may be isofunctional with the well known “south-east” patch of plastocyanin. Calculations of surface electrostatic potential distribution in the mutants of cytochromec 6 and plastocyanin indicate that the changes in protein reactivity depend on the surface electrostatic potential pattern rather than on the net charge modification induced by mutagenesis. Phe-64, which is close to the heme group and may be the counterpart of Tyr-83 in plastocyanin, does not appear to be involved in the electron transfer to photosystem I. In contrast, Arg-67, which is at the edge of the cytochrome c 6 acidic area, seems to be crucial for the interaction with the reaction center."
https://openalex.org/W2019608696,"γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors comprise a subfamily of ligand-gated ion channels whose activity can be modulated by ligands acting at the benzodiazepine binding site on the receptor. The benzodiazepine binding site was characterized using a site-directed mutagenesis strategy in which amino acids of the α5subunit were substituted by their corresponding α1residues. Given the high affinity and selectivity of α1-containing compared with α5-containing GABAA receptors for zolpidem, mutated α5subunits were co-expressed with β2 and γ2subunits, and the affinity of recombinant receptors for zolpidem was measured. One α5 mutant (bearing P162T, E200G, and T204S) exhibited properties similar to that of the α1 subunit, notably high affinity zolpidem binding and potentiation by zolpidem of GABA-induced chloride current. Two of these mutations, α5P162T and α5E200G, might alter binding pocket conformation, whereas α5T204S probably permits formation of a hydrogen bond with a proton acceptor in zolpidem. These three amino acid substitutions also influenced receptor affinity for CL218872. Our data thus suggest that corresponding amino acids of the α1 subunit, particularly α1-Ser204, are the crucial residues influencing ligand selectivity at the binding pocket of α1-containing receptors, and a model of this binding pocket is presented. γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors comprise a subfamily of ligand-gated ion channels whose activity can be modulated by ligands acting at the benzodiazepine binding site on the receptor.

The γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) 1The abbreviation used is: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; BZ, benzodiazepine.1The abbreviation used is: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; BZ, benzodiazepine. receptor is the major inhibitory ligand-gated ion channel in the mammalian brain (reviewed in Ref. 1Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This chloride channel is a heteropentameric complex composed of different subunits that exist in many isoforms, α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ε, and ρ1–2. The α1β2γ2 combination is thought to be the most abundant subtype of this receptor family found in the adult brain (2McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) and corresponds to the first pharmacological GABAA receptor subtype clearly identified (3Langer S.Z. Arbilla S. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 1988; 2: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Many classes of drugs interact with this receptor, including the benzodiazepines (BZ), which are the most widely used tranquilizers. The BZ binding site is located between the α and γ subunits (4Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In addition to BZs, other chemically distinct classes of molecules (5Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-233PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gardner C.R. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1992; 16: 755-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) interact with this binding site, including the triazolopyridazines (CL218872), the β-carbolines, and the imidazopyridines (zolpidem, saripidem). Mapping the BZ binding site by alanine scanning mutagenesis (7Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has led to the identification of histidine 101 of the α1 subunit (α1-His101) as a major component of the binding site interacting either with the nitrogen present in the core structure of most BZ site ligands (8Duncalfe L.L. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L.B. Martin I.L. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9209-9214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or with a phenyl moiety close to the core structure of these ligands (9McKernan R.M. Farrar S. Collins I. Emms F. Asuni A. Quirk K. Broughton H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Several other amino acids surround the BZ binding site. For instance, α1Y159S and α1Y209S substitutions affect diazepam-mediated potentiation of the GABAA receptor, and these mutants also abolish [3H]Ro15–1788 binding to the receptor (10Amin J. Brooks-Kayal A. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The α1Y161A, α1T206A, and γ2F77A substitutions result in a 3-fold increase in potentiation by diazepam (11Buhr A. Baur R. Malherbe P. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1080-1084PubMed Google Scholar, 12Buhr A. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11799-11804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). An inherent drawback of site-directed mutagenesis for the study of receptor ligand interactions is the difficulty in determining whether the amino acid substitution introduced produced its effect directly at the level of the ligand binding site. It is still theoretically possible that the mutation could induce an allosteric conformational change of the receptor itself that indirectly affects ligand binding properties. One way of minimizing this problem is to compare GABAA receptor affinities for subtype-selective ligands before and after mutation of the subunit showing the lowest affinity for the ligand and to take into account only those mutations yielding increases in ligand affinity as indicators for the involvement of the mutated amino acid at the ligand binding site. Such studies have identified α1-Thr162, α1-Gly200, α1-Val211, γ2-Phe77, and γ2-Met130 by comparison of the α1 and α3 subunits (13Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the α1 and α6 subunits (14Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4576-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), or the γ2 and γ3 subunits (12Buhr A. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11799-11804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Buhr A. Sigel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8824-8829Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For the present study, the ability of zolpidem to strongly discriminate between α1β2γ2 and α5β2γ2 GABAAreceptor subtypes (16Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) was used to characterize mutated α5 subunits in an attempt to identify those amino acids imparting the preference of zolpidem for the α1 subunit compared with α5. By swapping the domain responsible for zolpidem interaction from the α5 subunit with that of the α1 subunit and then serially replacing the amino acids in this α5 sequence, we exhaustively searched for amino acids contributing to high affinity for zolpidem. This approach pinpointed three amino acid substitutions that are sufficient to confer an α1-like zolpidem affinity on the α5subunit. Amino acids are numbered in α1(rat sequence) with the putative signal peptide (25 amino acids) removed and in α3 and α5 by an alignment with their equivalent positions in α1. Compounds were obtained from the following sources: zolpidem, saripidem (Synthélabo Recherche); CL218872 (American Cyanamide); and [3H]flumazenil (83.2 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products). Cloned cDNAs encoding the α1, α5, β2, and γ2 subunits of rat GABAA receptor were supplied by Prof. P. H. Seeburg (University of Heidelberg) and were subcloned into expression vectors as described previously (17Besnard F. Even Y. Itier V. Granger P. Partiseti M. Avenet P. Depoortere H. Graham D. J.

PCR Protocols with Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). 50-Mer polymerase chain reaction primers, overlapping in the chimeric area with 15 pairing nucleotides in 5′ and 3′, were used to generate chimeric polymerase chain reaction products to be subcloned into the BsmBI and EcoRI sites of the α5 cDNA. Site-directed mutagenesis was obtained with the unique site elimination method (19Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Selection primer was designed to disrupt a ScaI site in the ampicillin resistance. Mutagenic primer was always designed with at least 10 bases before and after the mutated codons, ending with a G or C. For mutant α5m10, two mutagenic primers were used. Plasmids were purified by ion exchange chromatography (Qiagen). All mutants were checked by sequencing. αxβ2γ2combinations of rat GABAA receptor subunits (where αx is α1, α5, or any chimera between the two) were transiently transfected in a 1:4:0.2 ratio using the Chen and Okayama procedure (20Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) on HEK293 cells seeded at 3 × 106/100-mm dish in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were collected 2 days post-transfection for binding assays. For electrophysiological assays, cells were transfected with the Fugene reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Binding assays were performed as described previously (17Besnard F. Even Y. Itier V. Granger P. Partiseti M. Avenet P. Depoortere H. Graham D. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of membrane preparation from the transfected cells were incubated with different concentrations of [3H]flumazenil for the equilibrium saturation analysis. For competitive inhibition experiments, 50 μg of membrane preparation of the transfected cells were incubated with [3H]flumazenil at a concentration of 4 nm in the presence of various concentrations of the competing ligand. The concentration of ligand that produced half-maximal inhibition of [3H]flumazenil binding (IC50 value) was established by nonlinear regression analysis using Origin 3.0 software (Microcal Inc.) for each of the GABAA receptor combinations and a K i value deduced using the Cheng and Prusoff equation (21Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12131) Google Scholar). We used the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique with symmetrical chloride conditions (pipette solution composition was 140 mm CsCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes/Tris-OH, pH 7.2, 4 mm Na2ATP; external solution was 147 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes/Tris-OH, pH 7.4). Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instrument) connected to a personal computer driven by the Clampex7 software. For EC50determinations, the nonlinear curve fitting routine of the Origin software (Microcal Software Inc.) was used. The α1 or α5 subunits were co-expressed together with β2 and γ2 in HEK 293 cells, and the parameters of [3H]flumazenil binding to membrane preparations of these transfected cells were evaluated in equilibrium binding assays. Transfected receptors displayed a similar affinity for several benzodiazepine site ligands such as flumazenil but differed remarkably in their affinity for zolpidem and CL218872 (TableI). CL218872 is 3–10 times more selective for α1- than for α5-containing subtypes, and zolpidem is over 300 times more selective (Table I) (17Besnard F. Even Y. Itier V. Granger P. Partiseti M. Avenet P.

Three chimeras (α5C1, α5C2, and α5C3) of α1 and α5 were constructed in the putative extracellular N-terminal domain (Fig. 1). The α5C1 subunit corresponds to an α5subunit in which the 198–204 region (GTENIST) is replaced by the corresponding amino acids of α1 (DSGIVQS). The α5C2 subunit has an additional 172–176 region (NGSTK) of α5 replaced by the corresponding amino acids of α1 (REPAR). The α5C3 subunit has an additional 162–164 region (TRA) of α5 replaced by the corresponding amino acids of α1 (PNS). Each of these chimeras was transfected with β2 and γ2subunits in HEK293 cells, and the affinity of the corresponding combination for [3H]flumazenil was determined. Both wild type and chimeric receptors displayed similar high affinity for [3H]flumazenil (Table II), demonstrating that the pharmacological profile of this BZ antagonist at its binding site was not affected by these mutations.Table IIMutant receptor affinity for zolpidemαxMutation introducedK i(zolpidem)K d (flumazenil)nmnmα129.6 ± 2.21.52 ± 0.15α5>10,0000.81 ± 0.03Chimerasα5 domains replaced by α1α5C1198–204244 ± 931.4 ± 0.45α5C2172–176; 198–204210 ± 521.34 ± 0.38α5C3162–164; 172–176; 198–20499.2 ± 53.11.62 ± 0.20MutantsSequence in 198–204α5m1GSGIVQS365 ± 148α5m2DTGIVQS330 ± 20α5m3DSEIVQS2520 ± 250α5m4DSGNVQSNDaND, not determined.α5m5DSGIIQS607 ± 26α5m6DSGIVSS520 ± 3α5m7DSGIVQT2304 ± 328Chimeric subunits were constructed by exchanging various parts of the N-terminal extracellular domain between α5 and α1.

The α5C1β2γ2 receptor showed a K i value of 244 ± 93 nm for zolpidem, representing an increase in affinity of at least 100-fold for zolpidem compared with that of the wild type α5β2γ2. TheK i values of α5C2β2γ2 and α5C3β2γ2 for zolpidem were 210 ± 52 and 99.2 ± 53.1 nm, respectively. The α5C3β2γ2 combination exhibited an affinity for zolpidem close to that exhibited by the α1β2γ2 combination. Regions 162–164 and 198–204 of α1 are therefore of crucial importance for zolpidem affinity. To determine the precise amino acids involved in high affinity zolpidem binding, combinations of amino acids were then substituted between α5 and α1 in the 162–164 and 198–204 regions of α5. Seven amino acids are different from α1 in the 198–204 region of α5. Each combination of six amino acids in this region was substituted by their corresponding residues found in α1. In other terms, mutants α5m1 to α5m7 correspond to chimera α5C1 except for a single residue in the 198–204 region that is conserved as in the wild-type α5. The various α5 mutants in combination with β2 and γ2 retained their capacity to bind [3H]flumazenil with the exception of mutant α5m4, which we chose not to analyze further. Mutants α5m3 and α5m7 lost part of their affinity for zolpidem compared with α5C1; the amino acids differing in these mutants compared with α5C1 were Gly200 and Ser204, respectively. To confirm that these amino acids were indeed responsible for zolpidem affinity, an α5m9 (E200G/T204S) that incorporates these two amino acids in α5 was constructed (Table I). The α5m9 subunit in combination with β2 and γ2 had a zolpidem affinity of 829 ± 197 nm, nearly the same as chimera α5C1. This result pinpoints the determinant roles that α1-Gly200 and α1-Ser204 play in zolpidem binding. The contribution of amino acids 162–164 of α1 is shown by chimera α5C3, whose affinity for zolpidem could be explained by a P162T mutation (14Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4576-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The α5m10(P162T/E200G/T204S) mutant that integrates both E200G and T204S and this new substitution was constructed (Table I). The resultant α5m10β2γ2 combination had an affinity of 105 ± 17 nm for zolpidem, corresponding to more than a 100-fold increase in affinity for this compound compared with that of α5β2γ2. A small 3-fold difference of affinity for zolpidem remained compared with that of α1β2γ2, but no other substitution appeared obvious that might account for this subtle change. CL218872 displayed a 3-fold selectivity for the α1β2γ2compared with the α5β2γ2subunit combination (K i values of 137 ± 25 and 333 ± 17 nm, respectively). The affinities of the α5m8β2γ2, α5m9β2γ2, and α5m10β2γ2 combinations for CL218872 were examined in [3H]flumazenil competitive inhibition experiments to check if the same amino acids involved in high affinity binding for zolpidem would also explain the more limited subtype selectivity observed with CL218872. Mutant α5m8(E200G) gave a K i value of 157 ± 23 nm for CL218872. Also, α5m10 (P162T, E200G, T204S) gave a K i value of 127 ± 9 nm for CL218872, again an affinity close to that displayed by α1β2γ2 for this compound. In contrast, α5m9 (E200G/T204S) exhibited a significantly lower affinity for CL218872 with aK i value of 447 ± 62 nm. Agonists of the BZ site allosterically increase the apparent affinity of GABAA receptors for GABA (5Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-233PubMed Google Scholar) and thereby potentiate chloride currents obtained with submaximal GABA concentrations. Zolpidem has been shown to maximally potentiate GABA-induced currents at 1 μm by as much as 384% at α1β2γ2 receptors stably expressed in HEK293 cells, but 10 μm zolpidem is without effect at α5β2γ2 receptors (17Besnard F. Even Y. Itier V. Granger P. Partiseti M. Avenet P. Depoortere H. Graham D. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To study the functional relevance of the three mutations introduced into the α5 subunit, a whole cell patch clamp analysis of HEK cells cotransfected with α5m10β2γ2 was performed. We wanted to verify not only the responsiveness of the mutant receptor to GABA but also check whether the gain in affinity for zolpidem observed in this mutated receptor translated into a potentiation of GABA-induced currents. The EC50 value for GABA measured on two cells was 4.2 ± 0.4 μm, a value that compares well with those of 4.5 and 4.2 μm observed for recombinant α1β2γ2 and α5β2γ2 receptors, respectively (24Ducic I. Caruncho H.J. Zhu W.J. Vicini S. Costa E. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 438-445PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, both diazepam and zolpidem potentiated the Cl− current induced by GABA at the mutated α5m10β2γ2 receptor. The mean potentiation values recorded from six cells were 108 ± 28 and 139 ± 31% for 1 μm of zolpidem and diazepam, respectively. The EC50 value of zolpidem (measured on four cells) was 192 ± 5.2 nm. All mutations in the α5 subunit were designed to substitute α5 residues by amino acids in their equivalent positions in α1. None of these mutations (except mutant α5m4) affected the affinity of the resultant recombinant GABAA receptor for [3H]flumazenil, the ligand used as a probe (see Table II). Moreover, all α5 mutants in this study (except mutant of α5m4) showed an increase in affinity for zolpidem compared with that of the wild type α5 subunit. This gain of function strategy strongly suggests that the amino acids identified are involved in zolpidem binding as opposed to an indirect effect resulting from a conformational modification. The only exception is mutant α5m4, which unexpectedly conferred no [3H]flumazenil binding on transfected cells; we currently do not know with this particular mutant whether the α5m4polypeptide is destabilized or if an α5m4β2γ2 heteromeric receptor is indeed formed but with conformational change impeding [3H]flumazenil binding. Among benzodiazepine site ligands, zolpidem has a strong selectivity toward α1-containing GABAA receptors. A chimera constructed by Wieland and Lüddens (14Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4576-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) comprising the N-terminal part of α6 up to amino acid 158 (with R101H) together with the rest of the protein exchanged for the corresponding fragment of α1 showed an excellent affinity for zolpidem (K i = 125 ± 50 nm). The zolpidem binding site on α1 could thus be expected to be localized principally between α1-Ala160 and the first putative transmembrane domain of α1 (amino acids 226–246). Three segments differ significantly between α1and α5 in this region of the protein: 162–164, 172–176, and 198–204 of α5. We thus generated three chimeras by substituting these α5 segments by their α1counterpart. The α5C1β2γ2 combination gave a K i value of 244 ± 93 nm for zolpidem. This represented a 100-fold increase in affinity compared with the wild-type α5-containing combination, which might correlate with the establishment of an additional hydrogen acceptor interaction (2–3 kcal/mol). Previous data (13Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4576-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Schaerer M.T. Buhr A. Baur R. Sigel E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 354: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have suggested that the α1-Gly200 contained in this region is of some importance for zolpidem binding. However, Gly200is replaced by a glutamic acid in α3 and α5, but α3 nevertheless retains a medium affinity for zolpidem (23Graham D. Faure C. Besnard F. Langer S.Z. Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 1996; 6: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, Gly200 by itself is not sufficient to explain the low affinity of α5-containing receptors for zolpidem. As such, a combination of amino acid substitutions in the 198–204 region of α5 could play an additional role, permitting further increases in zolpidem affinity to be attained. The α5C1 chimera includes this combination of amino acids and, in addition, others whose presence did not affect the parameters of zolpidem binding. Rather than testing all possible combinations, seven mutants were generated, each having six of the 198–204 amino acids substituted with their corresponding α1 counterparts. Two mutants (α5m3 and α5m7) did not confer an affinity for zolpidem equivalent to that of chimera α5C1 (TableII). The two amino acids that were unchanged in these mutants revealed certain substitutions necessary to explain chimera α5C1properties. The generation of α5m9 confirmed that two amino acids changes (E200G/T204S) are also sufficient to confer α5 with high affinity zolpidem binding properties (TableI). The α5C2β2γ2 combination exhibited a K i value of 210 ± 52 nm for zolpidem, indicating that amino acids 172–176 play no significant role in zolpidem selectivity. The α5C3β2γ2 combination gave aK i value of 99.2 ± 53.1 nm for zolpidem, indicating that amino acids 162–164 are situated at the high affinity zolpidem binding site. The mutant α5m10(P162T/E200G/T204S) confirmed our assumption (based on results from Ref. 14Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4576-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that α5-Pro162 could have limited influence on zolpidem affinity. Alignment of α1 and α5 sequences reveals that 115 amino acids are different between α1 and α5. Given this difference, our present data highlight the finding that only three single amino acid substitutions are sufficient and necessary to confer an α1-like affinity for zolpidem on α5-containing receptors. Additional evidence discussed below may favor the hypothesis that α5P162T and α5E200G are involved in conformational changes and α5T204S is implicated in hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group of the serine side chain and an hydrogen acceptor site in zolpidem (Table II). Serine α1-Ser204 is essential for zolpidem affinity as observed when comparing mutant α5m7 with α5C1. Since serine residues can form hydrogen bonds with proton acceptor sites, α1-Ser204 could be involved in such an interaction with zolpidem. We suggest that this tandem interaction occurs via the carbonyl group of the acetamide side chain (Fig. 3A), and other experimental evidence also seems to support this hypothesis. Thus, NMR conformational studies on zolpidem and another imidazopyridine, saripidem, has revealed that zolpidem and saripidem differ in the nature and flexibility of their side chains (26Olivier A. Sevrin M. Durant F. George P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 2277-2282Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). That study reported that zolpidem can only adopt one specific conformation, whereas saripidem has two conformational states, one similar to that of zolpidem and a second in which the amidomethyl side chain of saripidem is on another plane (26Olivier A. Sevrin M. Durant F. George P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 2277-2282Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Interestingly, saripidem displays far less selectivity than zolpidem between α1 and α5. These observations suggest that the common conformations of zolpidem and saripidem are appropriate for maximal affinity with α1, and the second conformation observed only for saripidem corresponds to a different orientation of the carbonyl that permits accommodation of the α5pocket. The conformation of the carbonyl group present in the zolpidem molecule indicates that this carbonyl might well interact with Ser204. If this were the case, the carbonyl of saripidem could interact with the Ser204 of α1 in the conformation common to zolpidem and saripidem, whereas with α5 the alternative conformational state of saripidem would interact with another acceptor site (for instance Ser203 or Thr204). The carbonyl of zolpidem may thus be a major determinant accounting for the high selectivity of this compound for α1- compared with α5-containing combinations. Moreover, we suggest that this interaction might be with α1-Ser204, in which case this serine would be an essential component of the binding site that predetermines α1β2γ2 benzodiazepine subtype selectivity. Glycine is known to confer conformational freedom to peptidic chains. A glycine residue located close to amino acid position 200 is a feature common to all α subunits. Nonetheless, this residue occurs at slightly different positions on these subunits, thereby possibly contributing to different conformational states of their BZ binding sites. The α1-Gly200 amino acid may be in a position that orients the pocket favorably for zolpidem binding. Since the equivalent glycine residue occurs 2 amino acids upstream in α3 and α5, this could probably alter the BZ binding pocket of these subunits unfavorably for high affinity zolpidem binding. Ser204 could be inappropriately oriented to interact optimally with the zolpidem carbonyl group. This could explain why α3 combinations have intermediate affinity (compared with α1 and α5) for zolpidem, α3 bearing Ser204 and not Gly200. This hypothesis would correlate with the fact that α5 and α3 (in which glycine residues occur at equivalent positions) exhibit similar affinity for CL218872 (23Graham D. Faure C. Besnard F. Langer S.Z. Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 1996; 6: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the basis of this potential conformational role of α1-Gly200, one can speculate on reasons behind the loss of flumazenil binding observed with the mutant α5m4. Since the mutant α5m4 contains an asparagine from α5 adjacent to Gly200, instead of being 3 amino acids away from the glycine as in α5, the close proximity of this asparagine to the glycine residue might disrupt the BZ binding site. The increase in affinity for zolpidem obtained with the α5P162T mutation (α5m10 compared with α5m9) is approximately 5-fold (Table I). Although this cannot be explained by an additional hydrogen bond, it is known that proline induces turns and secondary structures. We can thus assume that this P162T mutation is responsible for a local reorganization of the zolpidem binding site, presumably allowing a better hydrophobic interaction with the pyridine heterocycle of zolpidem. Two tyrosines (α1-Tyr159 and α1-Tyr161) closely situated to this proline have also been reported to be implicated in benzodiazepine binding (10Amin J. Brooks-Kayal A. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,27Buhr A. Baur R. Malherbe P. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1080-1084PubMed Google Scholar), one affecting potentiation of GABA by benzodiazepines, the other affecting flumazenil affinity. These amino acids may interact with zolpidem, but, since they are present on α1 and α5, substitution mutagenesis would not help to resolve this point. In the case of CL218872 (Table I), it appears that Ser204 has a negative effect (mutant α5m9) on the affinity for CL218872 when the P162 is present. This effect disappears in the presence of Thr162 (mutant α5m10), thus suggesting that Pro162 may somewhat narrow the BZ binding pocket. As such, although no clear cut conclusion can be made regarding the involvement of α1-Thr162 in the BZ binding site, it would appear that α5-Pro162 alters the pocket configuration. CL218872, which displays a 3-fold selectivity for α1 compared with α3 and α5, does not possess a proton acceptor comparable with the carbonyl function of zolpidem. Nevertheless, CL218872 could be expected to occupy the BZ binding pocket with a certain degree of similarity to that displayed by zolpidem, since α1-Gly200is known to affect the interaction of the BZ binding site with CL218872 (13Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4576-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Schaerer M.T. Buhr A. Baur R. Sigel E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 354: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mutant α5m8 (E200G), indeed, conferred high affinity for CL218872, but the presence of Ser204 somehow affected affinity for CL218872 in mutant α5m9 (E200G, T204S), and the receptor affinity for CL218872 was again restored in mutant α5m10 with the P162T mutation. The α5 mutants behaved as if Gly200 was essential for high affinity toward CL218872, and as if the presence of Pro162 (mutant α5m9) would change the binding pocket such that Ser204 interfered with the binding of this compound. This confirms that α1-Thr162 and α1-Ser204 are situated close to the CL218872 binding pocket even if these residues may not interact directly with this compound. Both α and γ subunits contribute to the BZ site on GABAA receptors (4Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and it is generally assumed that the binding site is located at the α/γ interface (4Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The present study takes into account gain of affinity mutations incorporated into α5 to confer an α1-like affinity for some benzodiazepine site ligands. These data may be associated with previous mutagenesis studies on α and γ subunits, mainly the identification of α1-His101 (7Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and γ2-Phe77 or γ2-Met130 (12Buhr A. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11799-11804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Buhr A. Sigel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8824-8829Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The γ2-Phe77 substitution has the property to alter the affinity for different benzodiazepine site ligands or for only zolpidem depending on the amino acid residue substituted (15Buhr A. Sigel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8824-8829Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Based upon this and the current findings of this report, we can now propose a new molecular model of the α1-selective high affinity binding site occupied by zolpidem and in part by CL218872. We suggest that two regions of the binding pocket interact with proton acceptor sites of the ligand, one being α1-His101 interacting with the nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring and the other α1-Ser204interacting with the carbonyl group of zolpidem. In addition, two sterically-defined hydrophobic regions of α1 would interact with aromatic moieties of ligands. One hydrophobic region would be located near α1-Thr162, where it would interact with the heterocycle of zolpidem. The second hydrophobic interaction might occur between γ2-Phe77 or γ2-Met130 and zolpidem; this possibly takes place through the phenyl in position 2 of the heterocycle of zolpidem, given that CL218872, which does not possess an equivalent chemical group, is not affected by changes on these amino acid residues (12Buhr A.

A protein from the trypanosomatidCrithidia fasciculata binds specifically a 14-mer sequence, consisting of the complementary strand hexamer and eight flanking nucleotides at the H-strand replication origin. This protein was identified as the previously described universal minicircle sequence (UMS)-binding protein (UMSBP) (Tzfati, Y., Abeliovich, H., Avrahami, D., and Shlomai, J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 21339–21345). This CCHC-type zinc finger protein binds the single-stranded form of both the 12-mer (UMS) and 14-mer sequences, at the replication origins of the minicircle L-strand and H-strand, respectively. The attribution of the two different DNA binding activities to the same protein relies on their co-purification fromC. fasciculata cell extracts and on the high affinity of recombinant UMSBP to the two origin-associated sequences. Both the conserved H-strand hexamer and its flanking nucleotides at the replication origin are required for binding. Neither the hexameric sequence per se nor this sequence flanked by different sequences could support the generation of specific nucleoprotein complexes. Stoichiometry analysis indicates that each UMSBP molecule binds either of the two origin-associated sequences in the nucleoprotein complex but not both simultaneously.

In Crithidia fasciculata, kDNA consists of about 5,000 DNA minicircles (2.5 kilobase pairs each) and about 50 DNA maxicircles (37 kilobase pairs each) interlocked topologically to form a DNA network (reviewed in Refs. 1Englund P.T.

Minicircles, in most trypanosomatid species, are heterogeneous in sequence. However, two short sequences that are associated with the process of replication initiation and are located 70–100 nucleotides apart on the minicircle complementary DNA strands were conserved in minicircles of all the trypanosomatid species studied: the sequence GGGGTTGGTGTA, known as the universal minicircle sequence (UMS), in the minicircle heavy (H) strand, and the sequence ACGCCC in its light (L) strand (3Ryan K.A. Shapiro T.A. Rauch C.A. Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The replication of kDNA is restricted to the discrete S-phase, approximately in parallel with the replication of the nuclear DNA (reviewed in Refs. 4Shapiro T.A. Englund P.T. Annu. Rev.

At the end of the S-phase, the network is composed of replicated, nicked, and gapped circles and has doubled in size. The final steps, which occur at the beginning of the G2 phase, include the physical splitting of the double-size network and the covalent closure of the circles, followed by the network segregation during cell division. Immunolocalization and in situ hybridization studies have co-localized free replicating minicircles and replication proteins to two peripheral antipodal sites of the kinetoplast disc, suggesting that these are the sites in which minicircle replication is conducted through the action of two replication complexes (14Pérez-Morga D.L.

Minicircle replication initiates by the synthesis of an RNA primer at the UMS site. Elongation of the nascent L-strand displaces the parental L-strand, which serves as a template for the discontinuous H-strand synthesis. We have previously reported on the presence in C. fasciculata of a sequence-specific single-stranded DNA-binding protein that binds specifically to the UMS. The protein, designated UMSBP, was purified to apparent homogeneity from C. fasciculata cell extracts (28Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Avrahami D. Shlomai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21339-21345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Kapeller I. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The UMS-binding protein is a CCHC-type zinc finger dimer protein (31Abeliovich H. Tzfati Y. Shlomai J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7766-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) of 27.4 kDa with a 13.7-kDa protomer (28Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Avrahami D. Shlomai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21339-21345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Whereas neither the duplex form of a UMS dodecamer nor a quadruplex DNA conformation are bound by UMSBP, the protein binds efficiently the natural double-stranded kDNA minicircle, as well as a duplex minicircle fragment containing the origin-associated UMS (32Avrahami D. Tzfati Y. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10511-10515Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These studies have revealed that the kDNA minicircle origin region is significantly curved and distorted, suggesting that binding of UMSBP at the native minicircle origin site may be facilitated through the local unwinding of the DNA double helix at unstacked dinucleotide sequences within the UMS element (32Avrahami D. Tzfati Y. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10511-10515Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we report on the specific recognition of a sequence associated with the H-strand replication origin by UMSBP and discuss the protein sequence specificity and mode of binding at the origin region. Synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides were prepared by an Applied Biosystems oligonucleotide synthesizer at the Bletterman Laboratory of the Interdepartmental Division, Faculty of Medicine, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phenyl-Sepharose was from Sigma and hydroxyapatite from Bio-Rad. Radioactive nucleotides were from NEN Life Science Products, and polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs. C. fasciculata cultures were grown at 28 °C with agitation (150–200 rpm), in a medium containing 37 g/liter brain-heart infusion, 20 μg/ml hemin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were harvested during late logarithmic growth phase by centrifugation at 6,000 ×g and washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 100 mg/ml sucrose (enzyme grade, IBI). Cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −76 °C. Protein purification was carried out following the specific binding of the oriH-associated 14-mer sequence (H14, 5′-GTAGGGGCGTTCTG-3′) oligonucleotide, by the mobility shift electrophoretic assay, as described below. Cell lysate (fraction I, 1.3 g of protein) was prepared from 9.2 g of C. fasciculata cell paste by gentle disruption of theCrithidia cell membrane, using a non-ionic detergent in hypotonic solution, and was further fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, as described previously (33Shlomai J. Linial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16219-16225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 92.8 mg of protein, precipitated with 40–60% (of saturation, at 0 °C) ammonium sulfate (fraction II), were further purified as described below (see legend to Fig. 2). Preparation of recombinant UMSBP expressed inEscherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion, its specific proteolytic digestion, affinity chromatography, and further purification to apparent homogeneity were as we have previously described (34Abeliovich H. Shlomai J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Protein was determined following the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). Analyses were carried out as described previously (28Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Avrahami D. Shlomai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21339-21345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Kapeller I. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6891-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The 10-μl standard reaction mixture contained 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and the indicated amount of 5′-32P-labeled DNA ligands. Recombinant UMSBP or, alternatively, partially purified C. fasciculata protein, was added to the amounts indicated. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 0–30 °C for 30 min and electrophoresed in an 8% native polyacrylamide gel (1:32 bisacrylamide:acrylamide) in TAE buffer (6.7 mm Tris acetate, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Electrophoresis was conducted at 4 °C and 16 V/cm for 1.5 h. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films (Agfa Curix RP2 or Kodak X-Omat AR). Protein-DNA complexes were quantified by exposing the dried gels to an imaging plate (BAS-IIIs, Fuji) and analyzing it by a BioImaging Analyzer (model BAS1000, Fuji). One unit of UMSBP is defined as the amount of protein required for binding of 1 fmol of the oriL-associated UMS (5′-GGGGTTGGTGTA-3′) or the oriH-associated 14-mer (H14, 5′-GTAGGGGCGTTCTG-3′) DNA ligands, under the standard mobility shift assay conditions. The H14 DNA ligand (as well as some of its derivatives) exhibits two bands upon electrophoresis in native polyacrylamide gels. Only the fast migrating 14-mer species is capable of binding UMSBP. The two bands represent inter-convertible conformational forms as follows: (i) boiling of the oligonucleotides, prior to their electrophoresis in native polyacrylamide gels, results in the disappearance of the slow migrating species; (ii) only one 14-mer band is observed upon electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gels. In some experiments, as indicated in each case, oligonucleotides were heated at 95 °C for 2 min and then transferred immediately to 0 °C (for up to 30 min), prior to their use in the binding reaction, to eliminate potential secondary structures. Measurements of equilibrium binding constants, for the interactions of purified UMSBP with various DNA molecules, were carried out as described by Fried and Crothers (36Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 37Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and Liu-Johnson et al. (38Liu-Johnson H.-N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out under the standard mobility shift assay conditions, by serial dilutions of both UMSBP and the oligonucleotide probe, while keeping constant the molar ratio of addedprotein [Padded] to total DNA [DNAtotal] and varying the total concentration. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Quantification of protein-DNA complexes was carried out using a BioImaging analyzer, as described above. Data were analyzed as described by Liu-Johnson et al.(38Liu-Johnson H.-N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), plotting (1 − r)(α −r)/r versus1/[DNAtotal], where r is the fraction of the DNA that is in the protein-DNA complex band; [DNAtotal] is the total concentration of the DNA added, and α is the unknown but constant ratio of active protein to total DNA. The equation is solved by searching for an α value that will yield the best line passing through the origin. The slope reciprocal yields the binding constant (K). The fraction (β) of protein that is active in DNA binding, as judged by the ability to form a protein-DNA complex band in gel electrophoresis, is calculated from α, the total concentration of DNA, and the concentration of added protein using the equation: β= α[DNAtotal]/[Padded] (38Liu-Johnson H.-N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The value of β is usually significantly lower than 1 (38Liu-Johnson H.-N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It has been previously suggested that discontinuous replication of the minicircle H-strand initiates at or near the conserved hexameric sequence 5′-ACGCCC-3′, of the displaced parental L-strand (21Birkenmeyer L. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2362-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Birkenmeyer L. Sugisaki H. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2384-2392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at the proposed H-strand replication origin (oriH). A protein that interacts specifically with this unique site in kDNA minicircles has been detected in C. fasciculata cell extracts. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using oriH-associated sequences revealed (Fig. 1) that an H-strand 14-mer sequence (H14, 5′-GTAGGGGCGTTCTG-3′), which consists of the conserved hexamer (underlined) and 4 nucleotides flanking its 3′ and 5′ termini, supports the generation of specific nucleoprotein complexes. Such protein-DNA complexes could not be detected with either the complementary L-strand (L14, Fig. 1) or the duplex form of this sequence (not shown). It was further observed that neither the conserved L-strand hexameric sequence nor its complementary H-strand sequence, per se, constitutes a specific recognition site for the oriH binding activity. No protein-DNA complexes could be detected with hexamer concentrations as high as 12 nm, whereas a 14-mer sequence, containing the H-strand hexamer and 8 flanking nucleotides, supports the efficient generation of specific nucleoprotein complexes at ligand concentrations of 2 orders of magnitude lower (Fig. 1). Purification of the protein that interacts specifically with the uniqueoriH-associated 14-mer (H14) sequence from C. fasciculata cell extracts has revealed its consistent co-purification with the previously described UMS-binding protein (UMSBP) (28Tzfati Y.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6891-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similar levels of UMS binding activity and H14 binding activity were measured in crude cell lysates (FI, TableI); both activities were fractionated at the same pattern through a gradual ammonium sulfate precipitation (FII, Table I) and co-chromatographed by hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose (Fig. 2A) and hydroxyapatite chromatography (Fig. 2B). These observations indicated that the same protein, UMSBP, might be responsible for the specific binding of the two different origin-associated sequences.Table IDistribution of UMS and H14 DNA binding activities in fractionated C. fasciculata cell extractsFractionSpecific activityYieldaThe total Fraction I (FI) activity recovered in Fraction II (FII) was 84.6 and 84.2%, respectively, when assayed using UMS and II14 ligands.UMS-DNAH14-DNAUMS-DNAH14-DNAunits/mg × 10−5%Cell extract (FI)3.944.07(100.0)(100.0)FII(5–20%)bFII values in parentheses denote the ammonium sulfate percentage of saturation at 0 °C, at which the protein fraction was precipitated.2.472.671.01.0FII(20–40%)3.313.3529.729.1FII(40–60%)9.9310.4052.553.3FII(60–80%)0.550.321.40.8Cell lysate (Fraction I (FI), 1.3 g protein) was prepared from 9.2 g of C. fasciculata cell paste, as we have previously described (33Shlomai J.

Open table in a new tab Cell lysate (Fraction I (FI), 1.3 g protein) was prepared from 9.2 g of C. fasciculata cell paste, as we have previously described (33Shlomai J. Linial M. J. Biol.

DNA binding activity was assayed under the standard binding assay conditions as we have previously described (28,29), using the electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, and quantified using phosphorimaging, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 32P-labeled H14 5′-GTAGGGGCGTTCTG-3′ and UMS 5′-GGGGTTGGTGTA-3′ (10.6 fmol/assay) were used as radioactive ligands. To explore the possibility that UMSBP may bind both the conservedoriL-UMS and oriH-H14 sequences, we have measured the capacity of recombinant UMSBP, which was expressed in bacteria by a plasmid carrying the C. fasciculata UMSBP gene and purified to apparent homogeneity (34Abeliovich H. Shlomai J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), to bind the two sequences. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses, using the two sequences as radioactive ligands (Fig. 3), demonstrate clearly that both the authentic eukaryotic UMSBP, which was purified from C. fasciculata cell extracts (Fig. 3, lanes b and e), and pure recombinant UMSBP that was expressed in bacteria (Fig. 3, lanes a and d) bind efficiently both DNA ligands. Binding of the recombinant UMSBP to both origin sequences implies that recognition of the two minicircle sequences is an intrinsic property of UMSBP and has not resulted from an incidental cross-contaminating DNA binding activity in the crithidial protein preparation. Moreover, binding competition analyses, in which the binding of UMSBP to theoriH-associated H14 and the oriL-associated UMS was challenged, reciprocally, with increasing molar excess of these ligands unlabeled (Fig. 4), revealed the efficient competition of both ligands on the binding of UMSBP, with some preference of UMSBP to the H14 over the UMS ligand. Furthermore, the equilibrium binding constant measured for the interaction of UMSBP with the H-strand H14 is 1.1 × 109m−1 (Fig. 4, inset), a value close to the one measured for UMSBP interaction with the UMS element (28Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Avrahami D. Shlomai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21339-21345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), implying the similar binding affinities of pure UMSBP for the two DNA ligands.Figure 4The oriL - UMS and oriH-H14 compete with each other upon the binding of UMSBP. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and their quantification were as described above, using pure recombinant UMSBP (0.2 ng/assay). The 32P-labeled DNA ligands (10.64 fmol/assay) were either H14 (circles) or UMS (triangles) in the presence of increasing concentrations of these oligonucleotides as unlabeled competitors (0–50-fold, molar ratios), as follows: 32P-labeled H14, with unlabeled H14 competitor (●); 32P-labeled H14, with unlabeled UMS competitor (○); 32P-labeled UMS, with unlabeled UMS competitor (▴); 32P-labeled UMS, with unlabeled H14 competitor (▵). Inset, determination of the equilibrium binding constant for the interaction of UMSBP with H14 DNA. Samples containing serial dilutions of both UMSBP and H14 DNA (at a constant molar ratio) were analyzed by the mobility shift electrophoretic assay, following the procedure of Fried and Crothers (36Fried M.G.

The slope reciprocal yields a K value of 1.1 × 109m−1. The fraction of active protein (β) can be calculated from α, the total concentration of DNA and the concentration of the added protein [Padded], using the equation β = α[DNAtotal]/[Padded], as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the data in Fig. 4, α = 0.69 and β = 0.19.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of pure UMSBP to both DNA ligands is sequence-specific. Binding competition analyses (Fig. 5) revealed that an excess of 2 orders of magnitude of a non-related oligonucleotide (HG15) failed to displace both the oriH-H14 and the oriL-UMS from their respective nucleoprotein complexes, indicating the high specificity of these protein-DNA interactions. As was shown above (Fig. 1), the oriH-conserved hexamer,per se, is not a sufficient recognition site for the binding of UMSBP. To define further the sequence directing the specific binding of UMSBP onto the oriH site, a series of oriHH-strand oligonucleotides (ranging from 6 to 26 nucleotides long), each containing the conserved hexamer and sequences flanking its 3′ and/or 5′ termini (0–10 residues long), were used as radioactive ligands in electrophoretic mobility shift analyses. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, DNA ligands containing less than 4 residues on both the 3′ and 5′ termini of the hexamer showed a significantly decreased binding by UMSBP. In fact, no nucleoprotein complexes could be detected by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay with oligonucleotides containing <3 residues, flanking both the 3′- and 5′-ends of the hexamer. This was also the case with ligands consisting of the conserved hexamer and 2–6 residues flanking its 3′ terminus or 2–4 residues flanking its 5′ terminus. A significantly lower binding affinity is measured for UMSBP interaction with a 12-mer sequence containing 3 residues flanking both termini of the hexamer, with a measured binding constant of more than 7-fold higher than that measured for the interaction of UMSBP with H14 (Fig. 4,inset). On the other hand, using DNA ligands containing the hexamer flanked at both termini by sequences of ≥4 residues (ranging from 4 to 10 nucleotides), no further increase in UMSBP binding affinity (as deduced from equilibrium binding const"

PKA has been demonstrated to inhibit Raf-1-mediated cellular proliferation. PKA can both prevent Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation and directly inhibit Raf-1 catalytic activity. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of PKA on Raf-1-dependent processes, PKA potentiates nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cell differentiation, a B-Raf mediated process. This potentiation, rather than inhibition, of PC12 cell differentiation is curious in light of the ability of PKA to inhibit Raf-1 catalytic activity. The kinase domains of Raf-1 and B-Raf are highly conserved, and it has been predicted that B-Raf catalytic activity would also be inhibited by PKA. In this study we examined the ability of PKA to regulate the kinase activity of the B-raf proto-oncogene. We report that nerve growth factor-stimulated B-Raf activity is not inhibited by PKA. By contrast, an N-terminally truncated, constitutively active form of B-Raf is inhibited by PKA both in vitro and in transfected PC12 cells. These results suggest that the N-terminal regulatory domain interferes with the ability of PKA to modulate B-Raf catalytic activity and provide an explanation for the observed resistance of B-Raf-dependent processes to PKA inhibition.

Members of the Raf family of serine/threonine protein kinases (Raf-1, B-Raf, and A-Raf) have been shown to be key regulators of growth factor signaling in diverse biological systems. Raf can directly phosphorylate and activate MEK 1The abbreviation used is: MEK, mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NGF, nerve growth factor; PKA, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase; PKAcat, catalytic subunit of PKA; PKC, protein kinase C.1The abbreviation used is: MEK, mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NGF, nerve growth factor; PKA, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase; PKAcat, catalytic subunit of PKA; PKC, protein kinase C.

Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, the Raf/MEK/MAPK cascade mediates a signal relay from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, resulting in cell type-specific responses that include proliferation and differentiation (5Heidecker G.

An early step in Raf-1 activation involves the binding of Ras and the recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane. However, subsequent events are then required to generate full Raf-1 activity (reviewed in Ref. 8Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Diverse extracellular signals are integrated within the cell to elicit a tailored cellular response to different environmental cues. Signal integration is achieved through cross-talk between intracellular signaling pathways. It has been demonstrated that inhibitory signal integration occurs between the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway in a variety of cell types (9Wu J. Dent P.

PKA has been shown to inhibit Raf-1 by two mechanisms: (i) inhibition of Ras binding (9Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and (ii) direct inhibition of Raf-1 catalytic activity (17Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A.

Raf-1 signal transduction is also subject to negative regulation by the Ras-related small GTPase, Rap1. Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels and consequent PKA activation results in Rap1 GTP loading (21Altschuler D.L. Peterson S.N. Ostrowski M.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10373-10376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound form of Rap1 can bind to the N-terminal regulatory domain of Raf-1 (22Nassar N. Horn G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1702-11705Google Scholar, 26Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Thus, cAMP-dependent signaling can inhibit Raf-1 activity by several mechanisms including the direct phosphorylation of Raf-1 and the stimulation of the inhibitory Rap1 protein. By contrast to Raf-1, less is known regarding the activation and regulation of B-Raf. B-Raf has been demonstrated to be required for early mouse development and is essential for vasculogenesis (27Wojnowski L. Zimmer A.M. Beck T.W. Hahn H. Bernal R. Rapp U.R. Zimmer A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). B-Raf has been shown to be expressed at high levels in neural tissue (28Storm S.M. Cleveland J.L. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 345-351PubMed Google Scholar) and has been most extensively characterized in the PC12 cell line. Raf-1 and B-Raf are closely related and share extensive homology between their catalytic domains (29Eychene A. Barnier J.V. Dezelee P. Marx M. Laugier D. Calogeraki I. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1315-1323PubMed Google Scholar). Raf-1 and B-Raf both phosphorylate and activate MEK1 and MEK2 the isoforms, albeit with different specific activities (30Pritchard C.A. Samuels M.L. Bosch E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6430-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In a manner similar to Raf-1 regulation, PKA can phosphorylate B-Raf and block Ras-dependent B-Raf activation (31Peraldi P. Frodin M. Barnier J.V. Calleja V. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Calothy G. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the inhibitory effect of PKA on Raf-1-dependent proliferation, it has been demonstrated that PKA can potentiate B-Raf-dependent PC12 cell differentiation. This stimulatory effect of PKA appears to be indirect and mediated through Rap1 (26Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 32Yao H. York R.D. Misra-Press P.A. Carr D.W. Stork P.J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Thus, Rap1 is inhibitory to Raf-1 but stimulatory to B-Raf. The observation that NGF-stimulated PC12 cell neuronal differentiation is not inhibited by PKA (34Gunning P.W. Landreth G.E. Bothwell M.A. Shooter E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 35Heidemann S.R. Joshi H.C. Schechter A. Fletcher J.R. Bothwell M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 916-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) is curious in light of the ability of PKA to inhibit Raf-1 catalytic activity. The high degree of homology between the kinase domains of Raf-1 and B-Raf has led to the prediction that B-Raf catalytic activity would also be inhibited by PKA (19Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this study we have directly tested the ability of PKA to regulate B-Raf catalytic activity. We report that even though the activity of the isolated C-terminal catalytic domain is negatively regulated by PKA, PKA did not inhibit the catalytic activity of NGF-stimulated, full-length B-Raf. Our data suggest that the N-terminal regulatory domain interferes with the ability of PKA to modulate B-Raf catalytic activity. This finding resolves the apparent discrepancy between the putative inhibitory effect of PKA upon B-Raf catalytic activity and the observed stimulatory effect of PKA on B-Raf-mediated PC12 cell differentiation. A plasmid encoding the full-length human B-raf (pSL B-raf) was digested withStyI and NdeI to isolate the C-terminal catalytic domain (B-rafcat). The B-rafcat was subcloned into SmaI-digested pXen2, a Xenopus expression vector containing a glutathione S-transferase (GST) motif (20MacNicol M.C. Pot D. MacNicol A.M. Gene. 1997; 196: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to generate pXen B-rafcat-GST. For studies in PC12 cells, the same StyI/NdeI fragment was subcloned into EcoRV-digested SRα to generate SRα-B-rafcat. pSL B-raf was digested withHindIII and NdeI to isolate the full-length B-raf and Klenow-treated and subcloned intoEcoRV-digested SRα to generate SRα-B-raf. Standard polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis was employed to generate a lysine to methionine mutation at amino acid 482 (K482M) within pXen B-rafcat to generate the kinase-deficient B-rafcat K482M. The catalytic subunit of PKA in SRα (SRα-PKAcat) (36Muramatsu M. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was utilized for expression of PKA in PC12 cells. The kinase-deficient C-terminal domain of Raf-1,rafcat K375M (pXen vNAF) has been described previously (37Muslin A.J. MacNicol A.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription, pXen plasmids were linearized with EcoRI and capped RNA synthesized with SP6 RNA polymerase as described previously (20MacNicol M.C. Pot D. MacNicol A.M. Gene. 1997; 196: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DefolliculatedXenopus oocytes were microinjected with in vitrotranscribed RNA (10 ng of RNA per embryo) encoding GST or GST-Raf fusion proteins as indicated. Pools of 20 injected oocytes were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 units of aprotinin (Sigma) /ml, and 25 μm leupeptin) 12 h after microinjection (37Muslin A.J. MacNicol A.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% equine serum and 5% fetal calf serum. For transfections PC12 cells were plated on 35-mm polylysine-coated dishes at 50% confluency and transfected by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer 20 h after transfection. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was assayed for total protein by the Bradford assay (Pierce). Prior to stimulation, PC12 cells were incubated in low serum medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% equine serum and 1% fetal calf serum) for 20 h. NGF (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 100 ng/ml final concentration) was then added to the medium for 5 min. Cell lysate was prepared as described above. Raf-GST fusion proteins were partially purified from equivalent amounts (100 μg) of total cell lysate protein by incubation with 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a total volume of 250 μl (20MacNicol M.C. Pot D. MacNicol A.M. Gene. 1997; 196: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After rocking at 4 °C for 1 h, the samples were spun at 6,000 ×g for 5 s. The pellets were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl). PC12 B-Raf was immunopurified from NGF-stimulated PC12 cells by incubating 100 μg of total cell lysate protein with 2 μg of anti-B-Raf IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein G Plus-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h. The immune complex was washed as described above. Raf-1 was immunopurified from Xenopusoocytes by incubating 500 μg of total cell lysate protein with 2 μg of anti-Raf-1 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h. PKC activation of Raf-1 was performed using recombinant PKC (Upstate Biotechnology) following the supplier's protocol. For PKA pre-phosphorylation, agarose- or Sepharose-bound Raf proteins were incubated in the presence of 5 units of PKA (Sigma) in 50 mm PIPES, pH7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm unlabeled ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of lysis buffer. The Sepharose beads were then washed once in lysis buffer and once in Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C. The GST fusion proteins were then assayed for Raf activity in 20 mm Tris, pH7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β glycerophosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 100 ng of kinase-negative MEK, and 30 ng of PKA inhibitor (Sigma) for 10 min at 30 °C (20MacNicol M.C. Pot D. MacNicol A.M. Gene. 1997; 196: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Gardner A.M. Lange C.C. Vaillancourt R.R. Johnson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by adding SDS gel loading buffer. Samples were loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Novex) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose, and radiolabeled phosphate incorporation into MEK was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Western blotting to determine Raf-GST fusion protein levels was performed with a GST antibody at a 1:1000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound antibody was visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure to hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The B-Raf and Raf-1 proteins are highly homologous within their catalytic domains (81% amino acid identity). Because PKA can directly phosphorylate the C-terminal domain and inhibit the catalytic activity of Raf-1 (17Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M.

Gene. 1997; 196: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether the catalytic activity of B-Raf was subject to similar regulation by PKA. We first tested whether the catalytic domain of B-Raf was a substrate for phosphorylation by PKA. The catalytic domain of B-Raf (amino acids 385–765) was fused to an N-terminal glutathioneS-transferase moiety (designated B-Rafcat-GST). A point mutation was then introduced within the ATP binding site of B-Raf to render the enzyme catalytically inactive and prevent autophosphorylation (designated B-Rafcat K482M-GST). The B-Rafcat K482M-GST protein was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and partially purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Fig. 1 demonstrates that the B-Raf catalytic domain (B-Rafcat K482M-GST), like the Raf-1 catalytic domain (Rafcat K375M), is a substrate for PKA. No phosphorylation of B-Rafcat K482M-GST was observed in the absence of PKA (data not shown). The B-Rafcat K482M-GST protein migrates as a doublet under these assay conditions. The GST moiety when expressed alone was not phosphorylated by PKA (GST, Fig. 1), demonstrating that PKA phosphorylates site(s) within the Raf-1 and B-Raf catalytic domains. We next determined whether the activity of the B-Raf catalytic domain could be inhibited by PKA phosphorylation. The B-Rafcat-GST protein was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and partially purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. B-Rafcat-GST was incubated in the absence or presence of PKA, as described for Fig. 1, but with nonradioactively labeled ATP. The glutathione-Sepharose B-Rafcat-GST complex was then washed extensively, and the phosphotransferase activity of the B-Rafcat-GST was determined using a kinase-negative MEK substrate in the presence of radioactively labeled ATP. Preincubation with PKA significantly reduced B-Rafcat activity (Fig. 2, 44.7% inhibition ± 6.5 S.E., n = 3). We next wished to determine whether the inhibitory effects of PKA on B-Raf catalytic activity observed in vitro could be reproduced following transfection of mammalian tissue culture cells. For these experiments we utilized PC12 cells, which had previously been utilized to demonstrate cross-talk between the PKA and B-Raf signaling pathways (26Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 31Peraldi P. Frodin M. Barnier J.V. Calleja V. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Calothy G.

PC12 cells were transfected with B-rafcat-GST in the presence or absence of a co-transfected plasmid encoding the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAcat). Transfection of this PKAcat construct results in a high and persistent level of PKA activity in PC12 cells as measured with a CAMP response element-CAT reporter plasmid (data not shown). B-Rafcat-GST was partially purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography from PC12 cell lysates prepared 24 h after transfection. We observed that co-transfection with PKAcat inhibited the activity of B-Rafcat-GST in PC12 cells (Fig. 3A, +PKA). As in the in vitro study (Fig. 2), we did not observe complete inhibition of B-Rafcat activity by PKA (55.5% inhibition ± 4.4 S.E.M.,n = 4). Immunoblot analysis of the same lysates revealed that similar amounts of B-Raf protein were present in each sample (Fig. 3B), indicating that expression of PKAcat did not lead to translational inhibition of the co-transfected B-Rafcat-GST. Thus, the difference in catalytic activity reflects changes in the specific activity of the B-Rafcat-GST protein following PKA co-transfection. It would appear that PKA co-transfection results in a mobility shift of a portion of the B-Rafcat-GST protein (Fig. 3B). Given the inhibitory effect of PKA on the isolated B-Raf catalytic domain in transfected PC12 cells, we wished to determine whether PKA exerted an inhibitory influence on the activity of the full-length B-Raf enzyme present in PC12 cells. To directly assess the effects of PKA, we immunoprecipitated active B-Raf from NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. The B-Raf immune complexes were incubated in the presence or absence of PKA in vitro and subsequently assayed for B-Raf activity. PKA treatment did not result in any inhibition of B-Raf activity (Fig. 4A). By contrast, PKA treatment reduced PKC-activated Raf-1 activity (Fig. 4B, 38.2% inhibition ± 4.1 S.E., n = 3) as previously reported (17Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G.

Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We conclude that following NGF stimulation, the catalytic activity of B-Raf is not subject to inhibition by PKA. Moreover, rather than exerting an inhibitory influence on catalytic activity, PKA actually stimulated B-Raf activation. PC12 cells were transfected with full-length B-Raf-GST in the presence or absence of co-transfected PKAcat. Immunoblot analysis of the glutathione-Sepharose affinity-purified lysates indicated that similar amounts of full-length B-Raf-GST were expressed in the absence or presence of co-transfected PKAcat (Fig. 5A). In contrast to the inhibitory effect of PKAcat upon the activity of the transfected B-Raf catalytic domain (Fig. 3), PKA co-transfection stimulated the activity of full-length B-Raf-GST approximately 3-fold (Fig. 5B). This activation of B-Raf-GST by PKAcat is in agreement with a published report that demonstrated that elevated levels of cAMP in PC12 cells led to activation of B-Raf (26Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar).Figure 5Full-length B-Raf is activated by co-expressed PKAcat in PC12 cells.

First, PKA can prevent Raf-1 activation by phosphorylating the Raf-1 N-terminal regulatory domain and blocking Ras interactions. Second, PKA can phosphorylate the Raf-1 C-terminal catalytic domain and inhibit Raf-1 catalytic activity. The association of Ras with B-Raf is also inhibited by PKA (31Peraldi P. Frodin M. Barnier J.V. Calleja V. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Calothy G. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and PKA blocks Ras-dependent B-Raf activation. Similarly, based on sequence homology, it has been predicted that B-Raf catalytic activity would also be subject to inhibition by PKA (19Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence has suggested that rather than play an obligate inhibitory function in the regulation of B-Raf, PKA can actually stimulate B-Raf activity in certain PC12 cell lines via the small G-protein, Rap1 (26Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar,33York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). To address these apparently contradictory roles for PKA in the control of B-Raf, we have investigated whether B-Raf catalytic activity is inhibited by PKA. We report here that contrary to the effects on Raf-1, PKA does not inhibit the catalytic activity of the full-length B-Raf protein (Fig. 4). Interestingly, an N-terminally truncated form of B-Raf was inhibited by PKA both in vitro and in transfected PC12 cells (Figs. 2 and 3). These results suggest key differences in the mechanism by which PKA can modulate Raf isoform catalytic activity. The N-terminal regulatory domain of B-Raf may serve to mask the catalytic domain from PKA action, or the N-terminal domain may cause the catalytic domain to adopt a conformation that is not compatible with PKA inhibition in the context of the full-length B-Raf enzyme. Alternatively, PKA may exert both positive and negative effects on B-Raf, but the sum of these two effects of PKA favors B-Raf activity within the context of the full-length protein. The kinase activity of the Raf-1 isoform, on the other hand, is subject to inhibition by PKA either in the context of the full-length protein or when the catalytic domain is expressed alone (17Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 19Mischak H. Seitz T.

Indeed, a cell-permeable cAMP analogue has been shown to inhibit tumors in nude mice (42Ally S. Clair T. Katsaros D. Tortora G. Yokozaki H. Finch R.A. Avery T.L. Cho C.Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5650-5655PubMed Google Scholar), revert v-raftransformation, and induce apoptosis in v-abl transformed cells (41Weissinger E.M. Eissner G. Grammer C. Fackler S. Haefner B. Yoon L.S. Lu K.S. Bazarov A. Sedivy J.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3229-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that cAMP analogues would not revert B-raf-mediated cellular transformation. Our findings indicating that the catalytic activity of full-length B-Raf is not subject to inhibition by PKA are compatible with several recent observations concerning PKA and B-Raf cross-talk. It has been shown that elevated intracellular cAMP levels had differential effects on Raf-1 and B-Raf when the cells were maintained in serum-containing media (39Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5524-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with cAMP-induced PKA inhibiting active Raf-1 but having little effect on active, full-length B-Raf. PKA has also been demonstrated to stimulate MAPK in certain cell types (26Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar,43Young S.W. Dickens M. Tavare J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 44Frodin M. Peraldi P. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This stimulation is mediated indirectly by PKA through the Rap1-dependent activation of B-Raf (26Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 33York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Unlike the Ras-dependent activation of B-Raf, Rap1-dependent activation is refractory to PKA. These regulatory differences between Raf isoforms may tailor the cellular response following extracellular ligand stimulation. For example, although simultaneous cAMP elevation generally results in a block to growth factor-stimulated signaling, in PC12 cells (which express B-Raf) the combination results in the potentiation of growth factor-stimulated differentiation. The mechanistic basis of the isoform-specific resistance to inhibition by PKA has not hitherto been fully understood. In addition to Ras, Rap1-dependent B-Raf activation was necessary for both the phenotypic extension of neurites and the induction of differentiation-specific gene expression in PC12 cells (33York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Rap1-dependent activation of differentiation was dependent upon endogenous PKA activity (32Yao H. York R.D. Misra-Press P.A. Carr D.W. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our findings would suggest that although Raf-1 activity is susceptible to PKA-mediated inhibition, Rap1-stimulated B-Raf catalytic activity is refractory to the inhibitory action of PKA. Thus, the differential regulation of Raf isoforms by PKA would allow certain cell types to interpret PKA signaling in a stimulatory rather than an inhibitory manner on MAPK-dependent processes. Indeed, we observe activation rather than inhibition of full-length B-Raf in response to PKA co-transfection of PC12 cells (Fig. 5). Taken together, the primary means of negatively regulating B-Raf activity via PKA may be through regulation of Ras-dependent B-Raf activation rather than through inhibition of catalytic activity. Indeed, elevated cAMP and PKA have been shown to block Ras binding to B-Raf (31Peraldi P. Frodin M. Barnier J.V. Calleja V. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Calothy G. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). B-Raf activation by Rap1, on the other hand, is stimulated by PKA (26Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 33York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Because Ras and Rap1 have highly related effector domains and have been shown to bind to the same target proteins, further studies will be required to determine why Rap1 binding is refractory to PKA phosphorylation of B-Raf. The results of our study are most compatible with the hypothesis that following NGF-stimulated activation of B-Raf, the N-terminal regulatory domain serves to protect the catalytic domain from the inhibitory action of PKA. The idea that communication between the N- and C-terminal domains of Raf proteins contributes to the overall regulation of activity is not without precedent (45Cutler R.J. Stephens R.M. Saracino M.R. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Further, the 14-3-3 family of proteins has been shown to interact with both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of Raf-1, and it has been proposed that these interactions may be dynamic in nature resulting in the stabilization of active or inactive Raf-1 conformations (46Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde S.J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 47Thorson J.A. Yu L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y.

Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Curiously, the N-terminal regulatory domain does not protect the catalytic domain of Raf-1 from inhibition by PKA (17Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 19Mischak H. Seitz T.

The regulatory domains of Raf-1 and B-Raf, even though sharing two regions of high homology, are less well conserved than the respective kinase domains. Thus, amino acid differences between the B-Raf and Raf-1 regulatory domains may specify the determinants that modulate the susceptibility to PKA-mediated inhibition of catalytic activity.

https://openalex.org/W1979185020,"The WT1 gene encodes a zinc finger DNA binding transcription factor and is mutated in up to 15% of Wilms tumor cases. The WT1 protein binds to the promoters of many genes through GC- or TC-rich sequences and can function both as a transcriptional repressor and an activator in co-transfection assays depending on the cell type, the structure of the test promoter, and even the expression vectors used. Engineered expression of WT1 can lead to growth suppression by both cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. However, the transcriptional activity of WT1 that is required for growth control was not defined. We found that three N-terminal tumor-associated missense mutations of WT1 were defective for activation of both a synthetic reporter containing WT1-binding sites as well as the promoter of a WT1 responsive gene, p21. These mutants failed to inhibit cell growth but still retain their ability to repress several putative WT1 target promoters. These results indicate that activation and not repression by WT1 is the critical transcriptional activity of the protein responsible for its growth suppressing properties."

IgE Receptor (FcεRI) Function in Mast Cells and Basophils. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 32-52Google Scholar). The binding of IgE by FcεRI on mast cells and basophils is a fundamental step in the cascade of events that lead to allergic disease. The interaction of multivalent allergen with FcεRI-bound IgE results in cross-linking of the receptor, which triggers a range of biological sequelae that ultimately leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and the onset of the type I hypersensitivity response (1Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M.

Approaches that intervene in the binding of IgE by FcεRI may prove useful in the treatment of allergic disease. Clearly, understanding the molecular basis of the interaction of FcεRI with IgE would provide valuable information for such a therapeutic strategy. Studies from our group and others using chimeric receptors together with the epitope mapping of anti-FcεRIα monoclonal antibodies have identified the second extracellular domain of FcεRIα as the principle IgE interactive domain (9Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Mallamaci M.A. Chizzonite R. Griffin M. Nettleton M. Hakimi J. Tsien W.-H. Kochan J.P. J. Biol.

The first extracellular domain has not been demonstrated to have a direct IgE binding role; however, it does appear to make an important structural contribution in the maintenance of the high affinity IgE binding of the receptor (9Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Robertson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12736-12743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple regions of FcεRIα-D2 have been implicated in the binding of IgE. In a series of “gain of function” experiments using chimeric FcεRIα/FcγRIIa receptors, we identified three relatively large regions of FcεRIα-D2, each capable of independently binding IgE (9Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The FcεRIα regions encompassed by residues Trp87–Lys128, Tyr129–Asp145, or Ser146–Val169 when inserted into FcγRIIa were each able to impart IgE binding to the receptor. Mallamaciet al. (10Mallamaci M.A. Chizzonite R. Griffin M. Nettleton M. Hakimi J. Tsien W.-H. Kochan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22076-22083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have used a similar approach with chimeric FcεRIα/FcγRIII receptors, however, in “loss of function” experiments and identified four regions of FcεRIα-D2 that putatively contribute to IgE binding. The replacement of each of the FcεRIα regions encompassed by residues Ser93–Phe104, Arg111–Glu125, Asp123–Ser137, and Lys154–Ile167 with the corresponding regions of FcγRIII, was found to result in reduced IgE binding. In addition, a recent study by McDonnell et al. (13McDonnell J.M. Beavil A.J. Mackay G.A. Jameson B.A. Korngold R. Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that residues Ile119–Tyr129 of FcεRIα-D2, when synthesized as a conformationally constrained peptide, can inhibit the binding of IgE to FcεRI. Despite the localization of multiple binding regions in FcεRIα-D2, the interaction of FcεRI with IgE at the level of individual residues has not been defined. In this study, we have identified small IgE binding subregions of FcεRIα-D2, which have been analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis, and residues putatively involved in the interaction with IgE have been determined. These findings have enabled the development of a model of how FcεRIα binds IgE and contribute to our understanding of the interaction of the leukocyte FcR family with their Ig ligands. Chimeric FcεRIα/FcγRIIa or mutant FcεRIα cDNAs were constructed by splice overlap extension PCR 1The abbreviation used is: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; mAb, monoclonal antibody; hIgE, human IgE; EA, erythrocyte-antibody. (14Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullin J.K. Pearse L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 77: 61-68Crossref Scopus (2634) Google Scholar) using an expressible form of the FcεRIα chain (15Shimizu A. Tepler I. Bemfrey P.N. Berenstein E.H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1907-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or FcγRIIaNR cDNA (16Hibbs M.L. Bonadonna L. Scott B.M. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2240-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) as templates. The expressible form of the FcεRIα chain consists of the extracellular region of FcεRIα linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tails of FcγRIIa and is expressed on the cell surface and binds monomeric hIgE with an affinity comparable with that of the wild-type FcεRIα chain, as described previously (15Shimizu A. Tepler I. Bemfrey P.N. Berenstein E.H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1907-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Splice overlap extension PCR was performed as follows. Two PCR reactions were used to amplify the FcεRIα-FcγRIIa or FcεRIα fragments to be spliced together. The reactions were performed on 100 ng of the FcεRIα cDNA in the presence of 500 ng of each oligonucleotide primer, 1.25 mm dNTPs, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 1.25 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2using 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Amplitaq; Cetus) for 25 amplification cycles. A third PCR was performed to splice the two fragments and amplify the spliced product. 100 ng of each purified fragment was used with the appropriate oligonucleotide primers under the above PCR conditions. Chimeric and mutant receptor cDNA expression constructs were produced by subcloning the cDNAs into the eukaryotic expression vector pKC3 (17Van Doren K. Hanahan D. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 606-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each cDNA was engineered in the PCRs to have anEcoRI site at their 5′-end (the 5′-flanking oligonucleotide primer containing an EcoRI recognition site) and aSalI site at their 3′ end (the 3′-flanking oligonucleotide primer containing a SalI recognition site), which enabled the cDNAs to be cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pKC3. The nucleotide sequence integrities of the chimeric cDNAs were determined by dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52497) Google Scholar) using SequenaseTM (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) as described (19Kraft R. Tardiff J. Krauter K.S. Leinward L.A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 544-547PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-FcεRIα mAb 3B4 and the anti-FcγRIIa mAb 8.2 were produced in this laboratory (20Ierino F.L. Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1794-1799PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-FcεRIα mAb 15A5 was a gift of Dr. J. Kochan (12Riske F. Hakimi J. Mallamaci M. Griffin M. Pilson B. Tobkes N. Lin P. Danho W. Kochan J. Chizzonite R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11245-11251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse IgE anti-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl mAb (TIB142) was produced from a hybridoma cell line obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD); the mouse IgG1 anti-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl mAb (A3) was produced from a hybridoma cell line that was a gift of Dr. A. Lopez (21Lopez A.F. Strath M. Sanderson C.J. Immunology. 1983; 48: 503-509PubMed Google Scholar). Human IgE myeloma protein was purified from the serum of a myeloma patient. IgE was precipitated with NH4SO4, and then IgG was removed by chromatography on protein A, and IgE was purified by size fractionation chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 HR ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified IgE was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and contaminating IgG was estimated at <1%. COS-7 cells (30–50% confluent per 5-cm2 Petri dish) were transiently transfected with FcR cDNA expression constructs by the DEAE-dextran method (22Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with a transfection mixture (1 ml/5-cm2 dish) consisting of 5–10 mg/ml DNA, 0.4 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 1 mm chloroquine (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories, Australia) containing 10% (v/v) Nuserum (Flow Laboratories, Australia), for 4 h. The transfection mixture was then removed, and the cells were treated with 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline (7.6 mmNa2HPO4, 3.25 mmNaH2PO4, 145 mm NaCl), pH 7.4, for 2 min, washed, and returned to fully supplemented culture medium for 48–72 h before use in assays. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Melbourne, Australia), and 0.05 mm2-mercaptoethanol (Koch Light Ltd., Birmingham, United Kingdom). The binding of Ig by COS-7 cells following transfection with chimeric or mutant receptor cDNAs was determined using two approaches. COS-7 cell monolayers transfected with FcR expression constructs were incubated with EA complexes, prepared by coating sheep red blood cells with trinitrobenzene sulfonate (Fluka Chemika, Switzerland) and then sensitizing these cells with mouse IgE or IgG1anti-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl mAb (23Parish C.R. Hayward J.A. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1974; 187: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Two ml of 2% EAs (v/v) were added per 5-cm2 dish of transfected cells and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Plates were then centrifuged at 500 × gfor 3 min and placed on ice for 30 min. Unbound EA were removed by washing with L-15 medium modified with glutamine (Flow Laboratories, Melbourne, Australia) and containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. COS-7 cells transfected with FcR expression constructs were harvested; washed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin; and resuspended at 107 cells/ml in L-15 medium, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. 50 μl of cells were incubated with 50-μl serial dilutions of125I-hIgE for 120 min at 4 °C. 125I-hIgE was prepared by the chloramine-T method as described (24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 328Google Scholar) and shown to compete equally with unlabeled hIgE in binding to Fc receptor expressing COS-7 cells. Cell-bound 125I-hIgE was determined following centrifugation of cells through a 3:2 (v/v) mixture of dibutylphthalate and dioctylphthalate oils (Fluka Chemika, Buchs, Switzerland), and cell bound 125I-hIgE was determined. Nonspecific hIgE binding was determined by assaying on mock-transfected cells and subtracted from total binding to give specific hIgE bound. Levels of COS-7 cell surface expression of the mutant FcεRIα receptors were determined by assessing the binding of the anti-FcεRIα mAb 22E7 (shown to bind distantly to the binding site; see Ref. 12Riske F. Hakimi J. Mallamaci M. Griffin M. Pilson B. Tobkes N. Lin P. Danho W. Kochan J. Chizzonite R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11245-11251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 2 μg/ml in a direct binding assay as described for the binding of hIgE. Any variation in cell surface receptor expression between the mutant FcεRIα and wild-type FcεRIα COS-7 cell transfectants (levels ranged from 80 to 120% of wild-type FcεRIα) was then normalized, and the binding of hIgE by the mutant FcεRIα receptors was corrected using the following formula: (mutant − mock IgE binding) × ((wild type − mock 22E7 binding)/(mutant − mock 22E7 binding)). Molecular modeling of domain 2 (D2) of human FcεRIα was performed using the Homology and Discover modules of the InsightII environment of Molecular Simulations Inc. on a Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation. The model of FcεRIα-D2 was constructed by mutation of our previously described model of human FcγRIIa-D2 (25Hulett M.D. Witort E. Brinkworth R.I. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15287-15293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was based on the crystal structure of domain 2 of CD4 (protein data base file pbd2cd4.ent; Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY) (26Wang J. Yan Y. Garret T.P.G. Liu J. Rodgers D.W. Garlick R.L. Tarr G.E. Hussain Y. Reinherz E.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1990; 348: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 27Ryu S.-E. Kwong P.D.

Briefly, using a sequence alignment of FcεRIα-D2 with FcγRIIa-D2 and CD4-2 (28Hogarth P.M. Hulett M.D. Ierino F.L. Tate B. Powell M.S. McKenzie I.F.C. Brinkworth R.I. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 125: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), regions of FcγRIIa-D2 aligned with the β-sheet residues of CD4-2 were designated as structurally conserved residues, with other residues designated as loops. The coordinates for the atoms of the structurally conserved residues of FcγRIIa were assigned from those of the equivalent residues in the pbdcd4 file, with the coordinates of the side chain atoms assigned through mutation of the pbdcd4 side chains. Using the Homology Loop Search function, segments of Protein Data Bank files with the correct number of residues and appropriate gap distance were obtained. Incorporation of the loops was then followed by elimination of severe atomic overlaps (“bumps”) by altering the torsion angles of side chain Cα–Cβ bonds. The structure was then minimized using the Discover module to a maximum root-mean-square derivative of 0.0001. The FcγRIIa-D2 model was then converted to a FcεRIα-D2 model by mutation of the residues followed by further minimization of the structure using the above protocol. The three-dimensional structure of FcεRIα has not yet been solved. To aid in the localization of putative IgE binding regions of FcεRIα, we have generated a three-dimensional model of the second extracellular domain (D2) of FcεRIα based on the known structure of a related domain, CD4-2. CD4-2 belongs to the C2 set of Ig superfamily members, and sequence alignment of FcεRIα-D2 with CD4-2 suggests that this domain will adopt a similar folding pattern (25Hulett M.D. Witort E.

The structure of the FcεRIα-D2 model is characteristic of the C2 Ig-fold, comprising seven β-strands (A, B, C, C′, E, F, G) that form two antiparallel β-sheets of ABE and CC′FG (Fig. 1A).

In order to assess the contribution these three loops made to the binding of IgE by FcεRIα, chimeric receptors were generated, whereby FcγRIIa was used as a scaffold to accept each of these FcεRIα loop regions. The three resultant chimeric receptors consisted of FcγRIIa containing the following regions of FcεRIα-D2: (i) the B-C loop, residues Gly109–Tyr116; (ii) C′-E loop, residues Tyr129–His134; and (iii) F-G loop, residues Lys154–Glu161, designated the γ109–116ε, γ129–134ε, and γ154–161ε chimeric receptors, respectively. COS-7 cells were transfected with expression constructs of these chimeric receptors and tested for their capacity to bind mouse IgE (or IgG1) immune complexes by EA rosetting. Cells transfected with the γ154–161ε chimeric receptor bound IgE-EA (Fig. 2A, TableI), and the binding was specific, since mock-transfected cells or cells transfected with FcγRIIa did not bind IgE-EA (Table I). These data indicate that the Lys154 to Glu161 region of FcεRIα can direct the binding of IgE. As expected, this chimeric receptor was unable to bind IgG1, since the previously described IgG binding region, residues Asn154–Ser161 (25Hulett M.D. Witort E. Brinkworth R.I. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15287-15293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been replaced with the homologous FcεRIα sequence (Table I). Similar experiments demonstrated that the γ129–134ε chimeric receptor could also specifically bind IgE-EA (Fig. 2B, Table I), indicating that the Tyr129–His134 region also contains an IgE binding site. As expected, this chimeric receptor was able to bind IgG1-EA (Table I) due to the presence of the FcγRIIa Asn154–Ser161 IgG binding sequence.Table IChimeric FcR composition and Ig complex bindingA schematic representation of the domain 2 composition of the chimeric receptors is shown.

The binding of mouse IgE and IgG1 (mIgE and mIgG) was assessed by EA rosetting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” +, >10% of cells rosetting; −, no cells rosetting. As described above, the segment of FcεRIα-D2 encompassed by residues 87–128 had previously been shown to contain an IgE binding site, which we predicted to be the B-C loop (28Hogarth P.M. Hulett M.D. Ierino F.L. Tate B. Powell M.S. McKenzie I.F.C. Brinkworth R.I. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 125: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, when transfected into cells, the γ109–116ε chimeric receptor containing the FcεRIα B-C loop did not bind IgE-EA (Fig. 2C). Since the receptor was clearly expressed on the cell surface, demonstrated by its ability to bind IgG-EA (Table I), these results suggest that the Gly109–Tyr116 region is insufficient to bind IgE in its own right and therefore that the IgE binding region in the 87–128 segment is either not the B-C loop or requires the B-C loop in combination with additional surrounding region(s). This was further investigated by site-directed mutagenesis (see below). To identify the key residues of the FcεRIα binding regions (C′-E loop, residues Tyr129–His134; F-G loop, residues Lys154–Glu161) involved in the interaction with IgE, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace each residue in these regions with alanine. In addition, residues Trp113, Val115, and Tyr116 in the B-C loop were also substituted with alanine, since the FcεRIα-D2 model predicts this region is likely to be adjacent to the F-G and C′-E loops and may therefore contribute to IgE binding. The alanine substitution mutants of FcεRIα were expressed in COS-7 cells, and the binding of monomeric human IgE was examined in direct binding assays by titration of 125I-labeled hIgE (Fig. 3). The levels of cell surface expression of the FcεRIα mutants on the COS-7 cell transfectants were determined using the FcεRIα mAb 22E7, shown to detect an epitope distant to the binding site (12Riske F. Hakimi J. Mallamaci M. Griffin M. Pilson B. Tobkes N. Lin P. Danho W. Kochan J. Chizzonite R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11245-11251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using these results, the binding of hIgE was corrected for variation in expression between the mutant receptors, which ranged from 80 to 120% of wild-type FcεRI levels (data not shown). First, the individual alanine substitution of residues Lys154–Glu161 in the F-G loop indicated that each mutant retained hIgE binding, with the striking exception of the Val155–Ala mutant, where binding of monomeric hIgE was almost totally abolished, this receptor exhibiting only 3.2 ± 2.1% (mean ± S.D.) binding relative to the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3, A and D). The loss of hIgE binding by this mutant receptor was not due to decreased cell surface expression as demonstrated by its expression on the cell surface in levels comparable with that of wild-type FcεRI (data not shown). The substitution of Asp159 with alanine also resulted in diminished IgE binding, this receptor exhibiting 52.7 ± 7.2% binding of the wild-type receptor. The substitution of Lys154, Gln157, and Leu158 with alanine had no significant effect on the binding of IgE, these mutants exhibiting binding comparable with wild-type FcεRIα. In contrast, the replacement Trp156, Tyr160, or Glu161 with alanine produced the interesting effect of increasing the binding of IgE (132.7 ± 14.0, 123.7 ± 11.1, and 139 ± 15.0% of wild-type FcεRIα, respectively). Therefore, these findings clearly identify five individual residues of the F-G loop of FcεRIα (Val155, Trp156, Asp159, Tyr160, and Glu161 as playing critical roles in the binding of hIgE. The observation that substitution of Val155 and Asp159 decreased binding suggests that these residues may directly interact with hIgE. The increased binding observed upon substitution of Trp156, Tyr160,"

After cutaneous injury, a series of biological events take place that aim at the reconstitution of the damaged skin. Among them are the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of various cell types, the production of extracellular matrix, as well as the removal of irreversibly destructed tissue (1Clark R.A.F. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. Plenum Press, New York1996: 3-50Google Scholar). These processes are well described at the histological level, but little is known about the molecular basis. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the repair process, we used the differential display RT-PCR 1The abbreviation used is: RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; DDRT-PCR, differential display RT-PCR; skNAC, skeletal muscle nascent polypeptide-associated complex; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s). (DDRT-PCR) technique (2Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar) to systematically identify genes that are differentially expressed in wounded compared with normal skin. Because of the migration and proliferation of various cell types after injury, differences in total expression levels of a certain gene could be due to variation of the cellular composition rather than actually reflecting transcriptional or translational regulation. To minimize this risk, we exclusively compared normal skin with very early (24 h) wounds, because only minor changes in the cellular composition occur during this initial repair period. We obtained several partial cDNA clones, whereby expression of the corresponding mRNAs was either up- or down-regulated in response to cutaneous injury. We demonstrate that the levels of skNAC mRNA increase dramatically as early as 12 h after wounding. “NAC” is an abbreviation for nascent polypeptide-associated complex, a protein that crosslinks to nascent chains just emerging from the ribosome (3Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and thereby regulates protein translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (4Lauring B. Sakai H. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5411-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Lauring B. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9435-9439Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NAC is an ubiquitously expressed heterodimeric protein consisting of a 33-kDa α subunit and a 21-kDa β subunit. Furthermore, a skeletal and heart muscle-specific splice variant of the α subunit, skNAC (skeletal muscle NAC), has recently been identified. Most interestingly, this form seems to act as a muscle-specific transcription factor that stimulates myoglobin expression (6Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Overexpression of skNAC in C2C12 myoblasts induced early fusion of these cells into myosacs, indicating a role of this protein in muscle differentiation and in the regulation of myoblast fusion (6Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We demonstrate a strong expression of skNAC in skeletal muscle cells of the injured panniculus carnosus at the wound edge. In vitro, skNAC expression was confined to differentiating and/or differentiated muscle cells. These data suggest that up-regulation of a differentiation-associated transcription factor in injured muscle cells could modulate muscular repair processes after wounding. BALB/c mice were obtained from the animal care facility of the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried. They were housed and fed according to federal guidelines, and all procedures were approved by the local government of Bavaria. Three independent wound healing experiments were performed. For each experiment, 20 female BALB/c mice (8–12 weeks of age) were anesthetized with a single intraperitoneal injection of avertin. The hairs on the animals' backs were cut with fine scissors, and the skin was wiped with 70% ethanol. Six full-thickness excisional wounds (6-mm in diameter, 3–4 mm apart) were generated on the back of each animal by excising skin and panniculus carnosus. The wounds were allowed to dry to form a scab. 12 h, 1, 3, 5, and 13 days after wounding, four animals were sacrificed, and wounds were harvested by excising an area 7–8-mm in diameter that included the scab and 2 mm of the epithelial margins. A similar amount of skin from three nonwounded animals served as a control. The tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until used for RNA isolation. Total cellular RNA was isolated as described (7Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence and in situhybridization, the complete wounds were isolated and bisected. One half of the wound was frozen in tissue freezing medium (Jung, Nussloch, Germany), sectioned, and used for immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence studies. The other half was fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C, transferred for 4 h to 15% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C, and embedded in tissue freezing medium, sectioned, and used for in situ hybridization studies. 5 μg of total cellular RNA was reverse transcribed using 100 units of Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) and oligo(dT)12–17 as a primer. Human αNAC and skNAC fragments were amplified by PCR. Thirty cycles, consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 52 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, were performed. The following primers corresponding to the murine sequence were used: 59SPL5′ (5′-d(CCCAGCAGCTTCCCTGACTCTTG)-3′), 59SPL3′ (5′-d(CCCAGTTTG GACATAGCCTTCC)-3′), and 59tag5′ (5′-d(TTTCCAGCCGATCCTCGTCAA)-3′). A 453-bp fragment specific for skNAC was amplified with primers 59SPL5′ and 59SPL3′; a 279-bp fragment specific for αNAC was amplified with primers 59tag5′ and 59SPL3′. The amplified fragments were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. DDRT-PCR was carried out essentially as described (8Bauer D. Warthoe P. Rohde M. Strauss M. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 4: 97-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 ng of total RNA from normal murine back skin or from 1-day-old wounds was reverse transcribed using 5′-(dT12CG)-3′ (C1) as a 3′-primer in a total reaction volume of 30 μl. PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 μl using 0.5 μm upstream primer (N1: 5′-d(TACAACCAGG)-3′), 2.5 μm downstream primer (C1), 5 μCi [α-35S]dATP and 1unit of Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer). 40 cycles were performed (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 42 °C, 30 s at 72 °C). Each experiment was repeated at least twice. PCR products were separated on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Selected bands were eluted from the gel, reamplified by PCR, cloned into pBluescript KSII(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and sequenced. RNase protection assays were performed as described (9Werner S. Peters K.G. Longaker M.T. Fuller-Pace F. Banda M. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6896-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). 453-bp fragments corresponding to nt 5765–6217 of the mouse skNAC cDNA (6Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or the corresponding rat cDNA served as templates for the generation of32P-labeled antisense riboprobes. Furthermore, cDNA fragments from the 5′ end of the coding region of murine myogenin (280 nt; primers derived from the rat sequence) (10Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K. Cell. 1989; 56: 607-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), murine α cardiac/fetal muscle actin (180 nt) (11Alonso S. Minty A. Bourlet Y. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), and of murine α skeletal muscle actin (218 nt) (11Alonso S. Minty A. Bourlet Y. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) were used. A 187-bp fragment (nt 5371–5557) specific for the skNAC cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript KSII(+) (Stratagene) and linearized. Sense and antisense riboprobes were generated using T3 or T7 RNA polymerases and [α-35S]UTP. 6-μm frozen sections from the middle of the wound were hybridized as described (12Rosenthal A. Chan S. Henzel W.M. Haskell C. Kuang W.-J. Chen E. Wilcox J. Ullrich A. Goeddel D. EMBO J. 1987; 12: 3641-3646Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). After hybridization, sections were coated with NTB2 nuclear emulsion (Eastman Kodak) and exposed at 4 °C in the dark for 4 weeks. After development, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin/eosin. 6-μm frozen sections from the middle of 5-day-old murine excisional wounds were fixed with acetone and treated for 3 min at room temperature with 1% H2O2 in PBS to block endogenous peroxidase activity. They were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified polyclonal antisera recognizing human and murine α and skNAC (1:2,000 diluted in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) (3Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Slides were stained with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase system (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) using 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole as a chromogenic substrate. After development, they were rinsed with water, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted. 6-μm frozen sections from the middle of 5-day-old murine excisional wounds were fixed for 10 min with cold acetone. Cultured cells were fixed for 10 min with a 1:1 mixture of cold acetone and methanol. Sections or cells were washed with PBS. They were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody, diluted in PBS containing 12% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.02% NaN3 (antibody dilution buffer). After washing with PBS at room temperature, sections or cells were incubated with the secondary antibody and diluted in antibody dilution buffer for 3 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, rinsing with water, and mounting, fluorescence was analyzed with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Mouse C2C12 and rat L6 myoblasts (American Tissue Culture Collection, 4th to 10th passage) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum (growth medium). At 90% confluency, they were shifted from growth to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum). Differentiation medium of C2C12 cells was changed every 48 h to avoid acidification. The differentiation process was monitored via analysis of myogenin and α cardiac/fetal muscle actin expression. Furthermore, cells were immunocytochemically stained for expression of skeletal muscle myosin using a polyclonal antiserum (Sigma). Fluorescence-activated cell sorted primary human fetal myoblasts were a kind gift of Dr. E.A. Shoubridge (Montreal Neurological Institute, Canada). They were grown in a supplemented growth medium as described previously (13Ham R.G. St.-Claı́r J.A. Webster C. Blau H.M. In vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1988; 24: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To identify genes that are differentially expressed during the process of cutaneous wound repair, we used the differential display RT-PCR technique to compare gene expression in normal and wounded murine skin. A 244-bp PCR product was obtained, which was significantly more abundant after amplification of cDNA derived from 1-day-old wounds compared with normal skin. Sequence comparison analysis revealed that this cDNA fragment corresponded to the α/skNAC mRNA. As shown schematically in Fig. 1A, skNAC is characterized by a large 6.0-kilobase second exon, which is spliced-in between the two short αNAC exons (exon 1 and exon 3, Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, our PCR-fragment was not located at the ultimate 3′-end of the α/skNAC cDNA but approximately 0.5–0.7-kilobase upstream (Fig. 1A), where a poly(dT) cluster allows annealing of primer C1 with only four mismatches. Furthermore, although only the first 10 bp of our fragment (the nucleotides corresponding to primer N1) were located immediately upstream of the splice site between exon 2 and exon 3 (Fig. 1A), sequence comparison revealed that it unequivocally corresponded to the skNAC and not to the αNAC sequence (Fig. 1B). To determine the site of expression of skNAC in the wound, we performedin situ hybridization studies using a 187-nt skNAC-specific antisense RNA as a probe. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining with an affinity-purified, α/skNAC-specific polyclonal antiserum was performed. We obtained a strong in situ hybridization signal as well as a prominent immunohistochemical staining in a certain population of cells below the granulation tissue. The morphology of these cells suggested them to be muscle cells of the panniculus carnosus, a striated muscle that is located below the dermis of rodents. This hypothesis was supported by the expression of skeletal muscle myosin in these cells, as determined by immunofluorescence staining of serial sections with a polyclonal antiserum against this protein (data not shown). skNAC transcripts were exclusively detected in the myofibers of the panniculus carnosus. As shown in Fig. 2A, mRNA levels were very low in normal striated muscle cells at a distance from the wound. However, there was a dramatic increase in skNAC mRNA levels in muscle cells adjacent to the site of injury. Because our antiserum is directed against a carboxylterminal peptide, we cannot discriminate between α and skNAC at the protein level. However, the almost exclusive expression of the skNAC variant in muscle tissue 2B. Munz, unpublished data. indicates that the signal seen in these cells results from skNAC expression. With this antiserum, we obtained a particularly strong staining of the injured ends of the panniculus carnosus (Fig. 2B). In addition, apart from the prominent staining of the panniculus carnosus, we found a weak and diffuse staining of almost every cell present in the wound (Fig. 2B and data not shown), indicating ubiquitous expression of the α/βNAC complex. The skNAC positive cells might represent myotubes or activated satellite cells. The latter are undifferentiated myogenic precursor cells involved in muscle regeneration. Recently, c-met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, was shown to be a useful marker for satellite cells (14Cornelison D.D.W. Wold B.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 15Tatsumi R. Anderson J.E. Nevoret C.J. Halevy O. Allen R.E. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 114-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 16Gallevi R. Leshem Y. Aoki S. Nakamura T. Halevy O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed expression of this protein in our murine wounds (Fig. 2C). Indeed, both α/skNAC and c-met were coexpressed at the injured tips of the panniculus carnosus below the wound and at the wound edge (Fig. 2D), indicating that skNAC up-regulation might indeed be characteristic for activated satellite cells. However, because of limitations in the resolution, it is not possible to unequivocally determine whether these proteins are indeed expressed within the same cell. Because α and skNAC proteins seem to be very different in function, we first analyzed if both of them, or only the sk variant, were induced after injury. Therefore, we performed RNase protection analysis with total RNA from normal and wounded skin. A 453-bp fragment, which overlaps the 3′-splice site (Fig. 1A) was amplified by PCR and used for the generation of a32P-labeled antisense riboprobe. This probe allows the simultaneous detection of skNAC and αNAC in one sample of RNA. Fig. 3A shows that αNAC mRNA was far more abundant than skNAC mRNA in both normal and wounded skin, probably because of its ubiquitous expression. Nevertheless, this form was only slightly induced after injury. Furthermore, expression of the αNAC binding partner βNAC was not induced after skin injury (data not shown). The skNAC transcript was hardly detectable in normal skin. However, expression of this variant was dramatically induced as early as 12 h after wounding. This result was reproduced with RNAs from three independent wound healing experiments. As assessed by Northern blotting, αNAC and skNAC transcripts had the expected sizes of 0.9- and 7.0-kilobases (data not shown). To determine a possible role of skNAC in muscle repair, we compared its expression with that of the well characterized skeletal muscle-specific transcription factor myogenin (10Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K. Cell. 1989; 56: 607-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) in our wound healing model. Myogenin controls early differentiation events during development (10Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K. Cell. 1989; 56: 607-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be one of the first myogenic transcription factors to be induced in most murine models of muscle repair (17Fuchtbauer E.M. Westphal H. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Grounds M.D. Garrett K.L. Lai M.C. Wright W.E. Beilharz M.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 267: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In injured skin, myogenin mRNA was first detected 24 h after injury (Fig. 3B), indicating that at least at the mRNA level, skNAC induction even precedes that of myogenin. Furthermore, myogenin expression remained high at later stages of the repair process, reaching maximal levels around day 5 after injury. By contrast, skNAC mRNA expression rapidly declined and was approximately half-maximal already 24 h after wounding (Fig. 3A). In addition, as described in several human models of skeletal muscle injury (19Franke W.W. Stehr S. Stumpp S. Kuhn C. Heid H. Rackwitz H.R. Schnolzer M. Baumann R. Holzhausen H.J. Moll R. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 245-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we could detect transient expression of α cardiac/fetal muscle actin (Fig. 3C) at later stages of the repair process. The good correlation of myogenin and α cardiac/fetal muscle actin expression with most models of muscle regeneration indicates that the murine panniculus carnosus is a useful model to study skeletal muscle regeneration. As assessed by double-immunofluorescence staining, α/skNAC and myogenin seem to be expressed within different regions of the panniculus carnosus 5 days after wounding, although, due to the nuclear myogenin and the cytoplasmic α/skNAC staining and the low resolution, we could not analyze this question at the single cell level (data not shown). This is in agreement with the RNA data, which show that induction of skNAC expression occurs earlier than that of myogenin. Thus, as suggested by the expression kinetics, skNAC induction seems to precede myogenin induction in the course of the myogenic repair process. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that in vivo, skNAC-overexpressing cells represent a different subtype of myogenic (precursor) cells than myogenin-expressing cells. In any case, our data suggest the use of skNAC expression as an early marker for muscle repair processes. To exclude the possibility that skNAC induction might be caused by an enrichment of striated muscle cells in early wounds, we analyzed expression of α skeletal muscle actin, a marker for striated muscle cells (11Alonso S. Minty A. Bourlet Y. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), in the same RNA batches. As shown in Fig. 3D, expression of this gene remained equally high during the early phase of wound repair and subsequently even declined. Therefore, skNAC overexpression is indeed due to an increase in synthesis and/or stability of its mRNA. The dramatic overexpression of skNAC upon injury suggests a role of the protein in muscle regeneration. This view is supported by preliminary data, which indicate that abnormal expression and/or splicing of the α/skNAC transcript is associated with several types of inflammatory muscle diseases in humans. 3B. Munz, H. Lochmüller, and S. Werner, unpublished observations.Furthermore, preliminary results from our laboratory revealed a strong up-regulation of skNAC expression in the skin as well as in several individual muscles of the dystrophic (mdx) mouse, a murine model for muscular dystrophy (data not shown). Most importantly, increased levels of skNAC mRNA correlated with the presence of degenerated myofibers at the histological level. On the other hand, the basal expression of skNAC in the intact panniculus carnosus indicates that skNAC, in contrast to several myogenic transcription factors, might also play a role in the maintenance of functional skeletal muscle cells under physiological circumstances. To further study the regulation of skNAC expression in skeletal muscle cells, we compared its expression during myoblast differentiation in vitro with that of myogenin and α cardiac/fetal muscle actin, the molecules that we already used as “markers” for repair processes of the panniculus carnosus. As shown in Fig. 4, skNAC was induced approximately 30 h after a shift from growth to differentiation medium, in parallel with myogenin, and expression of both genes declined to basal levels within 4 days. Induction of α cardiac/fetal muscle actin occurred only slightly later than that of the transcription factors. The strong induction of skNAC mRNA expression upon differentiation correlates with data from Yotov and St-Arnaud (6Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), who demonstrated exclusive expression of skNAC protein by differentiated mouse C2C12 myotubes but not by undifferentiated myoblasts. Similar results were obtained with rat L6 cells (Fig. 4) as well as with primary human myoblasts and myotubes (Fig. 6), suggesting that skNAC induction is a general phenomenon associated with myoblast differentiation. In contrast to the differential regulation of skNAC and myogenin expression during muscle regeneration in vivo, these two factors displayed very similar expression kinetics after induction of myoblast differentiation in vitro. Therefore, we wondered if the two proteins might be simultaneously expressed in one single cell under the in vitro conditions. For this purpose we performed double-immunofluorescence labeling with antibodies directed against α/skNAC and myogenin. Only a very weak α/skNAC fluorescence, which was homogeneously distributed over the cytoplasm of every cell, was obtained before the induction of differentiation (data not shown). No nuclear staining was seen in any cell. 68 h after the induction of differentiation, some cells stained strongly positive for α/skNAC, whereby most of them had a fiber-shaped, differentiated morphology (Fig. 5). Although the antibody recognizes both the α- and the skNAC variant, the exclusive induction of skNAC mRNA expression during the differentiation process indicates that the strong signal seen in these cells is due to increased skNAC expression. Most interestingly, all nuclei of the strongly stained cells were also positive for myogenin, indicating that at least in vitro skNAC and myogenin might indeed be coexpressed during the myogenic differentiation program. Because myogenin is a marker for differentiating rather than for differentiated myoblasts, coexpression of this factor and skNAC suggests a role of skNAC in the early differentiation process in vitro. In conclusion, our results not only demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to identify new players in wound repair but also provide the first evidence for an involvement of skNAC in skeletal muscle regeneration after mechanical injury. The exclusive expression of skNAC in differentiating and differentiated muscle cells in vitro(Ref. 6Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar and this study) as well as the promotion of myoblast fusion upon overexpression of skNAC in C2C12 cells (6Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) suggests a role of this protein in muscle differentiation in vitro. However, the early increase in skNAC expression after injury in vivo that occurs before overt muscle differentiation argues against a role of skNAC in the in vivo differentiation process itself. By contrast, skNAC might regulate the expression of genes required for the onset of the in vivo differentiation program. In addition, skNAC could be involved in the activation of satellite cells or could initiate various other processes associated with muscle repair that remain to be elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W2108283569,"We have identified a new type ofS-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase in the cytosol of Escherichia coli that is expressed in early stationary phase under the control of the RpoS ς factor. This enzyme catalyzes the monomethyl esterification oftrans-aconitate at high affinity (K m = 0.32 mm) and cis-aconitate, isocitrate, and citrate at lower velocities and affinities. We have purified the enzyme to homogeneity by gel-filtration, anion-exchange, and hydrophobic chromatography. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was found to match that expected for the o252 open reading frame at 34.57 min on the E. coli genomic sequence whose deduced amino acid sequence contains the signature sequence motifs of the major class ofS-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases. Overexpression of the o252 gene resulted in an overexpression of the methyltransferase activity, and we have now designated it tam fort rans-aconitatemethyltransferase. We have generated a knock-out strain ofE. coli lacking this activity, and we find that its growth and stationary phase survival are similar to that of the parent strain. We demonstrate the endogenous formation of trans-aconitate methyl ester in extracts of wild type but nottam − mutant cells indicating thattrans-aconitate is present in E. coli. Sincetrans-aconitate does not appear to be a metabolic intermediate in these cells but forms spontaneously from the key citric acid cycle intermediate cis-aconitate, we suggest that its methylation may limit its potential interference in normal metabolic pathways. We have detected trans-aconitate methyltransferase activity in extracts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas no activity has been found in extracts ofCaenorhabditis elegans or mouse brain.

We have detected trans-aconitate methyltransferase activity in extracts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas no activity has been found in extracts ofCaenorhabditis elegans or mouse brain. Our laboratory has been interested in the proteinl-isoaspartate (d-aspartate)O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77), an enzyme that catalyzes the methyl esterification of spontaneously altered residues in a pathway that can lead to the conversion of isomerized aspartyl residues to normal aspartyl residues in a net repair reaction (1Clarke S. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999Google Scholar). We have postulated that the physiological role of this methyltransferase is to preserve the integrity of the polypeptide chain in the face of age-dependent non-enzymatic reactions that lead to alterations in its configuration (2Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3132-3137Google Scholar, 3Kagan R.M. Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the bacteriumEscherichia coli, this enzyme is required for optimal survival of stationary phase cells against environmental stresses (4Visick J.E. Cai H. Clarke S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2623-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Visick J.E. Ichikawa J.K. Clarke S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 167: 19-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably functioning to maintain proteins in active configurations under conditions where protein synthesis to replace damaged proteins is limited. In the course of our studies of the protein l-isoaspartate methyltransferase encoded by the pcm gene in E. coli, we found an activity in cytosolic extracts that appeared to catalyze methyl ester formation but was not dependent upon thepcm gene product. We have now traced this activity to that of a previously undescribed small molecule methyltransferase that is active on trans-aconitate, an apparently non-enzymatically formed derivative of the citric acid cycle intermediatecisaconitate. Since both types of methyltransferase activities are directed to substrates that can be formed by spontaneous age-related processes, we were interested in characterizing thetrans-aconitate methyltransferase. We found that the expression of this activity is dependent on the stationary phase specific ς factor RpoS. We have purified and characterized this enzyme, identified its gene, and characterized a knock-out strain lacking this activity. We were able to show thattrans-aconitate is an endogenous substrate for the enzyme and that the product is its monomethyl ester. E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table I. For analytical studies, E. coli cells were grown to stationary phase (20 h) in 5 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or M9 medium containingd-glucose supplemented with thiamine (18 μg/ml) and leucine (40 μg/ml) (Ref. 10Sambrook J. Fristsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, section A.3). When appropriate, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, or 20 μg/ml tetracycline were added. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 5 mm disodium EDTA, 10% glycerol, 25 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer at a final pH of 7.0. Cells were lysed by sonication in an ice bath using the microtip of a Branson model W350 instrument at an output control setting of 4 for three sets of 5 pulses separated by 30-s cooling pauses. The extract was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was used as a cytosolic fraction. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (11Lowry O.H.

Unless otherwise stated, the assay mixture consisted of 2 μl of 20 mm trans-aconitic acid (Sigma) in 0.4 m sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 5–15 μl of the enzyme preparation, 5 μl of 80 μm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine ([14C]AdoMet 1The abbreviation used is: [14C]AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine; [3H]AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.; specific radioactivity about 110 cpm/pmol, 53 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 μl 0.4 m sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, and water to a total volume of 40 μl. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 5–30 min, and the reactions were quenched by adding 40 μl of freshly prepared 2 m NaOH. Sixty μl of this mixture was immediately spotted onto an accordion-pleated 1.5 × 8-cm piece of thick filter paper (Bio-Rad 165-0962), and the paper was placed in the neck of a 20-ml vial containing 5 ml of Safety-Solve scintillation fluid (Research Products International Corp.), capped, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in a Beckman LS6500 counter after removal of the filter paper. In initial experiments, citrate was used as a methyl-accepting substrate. Here, the reaction contained 20 μl of 0.2 msodium citrate, pH 6.0 (Fisher, ACS-certified), 15 μl of enzyme preparation, and 5 μl of 80 μm[14C]AdoMet as described above. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and analyzed as described above. Other substrates tested included cis-aconitic acid, dl-isocitrate (threo-dsls-isocitrate; trisodium salt, 93–98%), (2R,3S)-isocitrate (threo-ds(+)isocitrate; monopotassium salt, approximately 99%), fumaric acid, tricarballylic acid, and malic acid, all obtained from Sigma, and succinic acid and oxalacetic acid obtained from Fisher. Four flasks each containing 2 liters of LB media were each inoculated with 2 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli strain MC1000 and were grown to stationary phase at 37 °C for 20 h with shaking. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g at 23 °C for 15 min. The cell pellet (29.1 g) was washed three times with 400 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm disodium EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) and then resuspended in 50 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm disodium EDTA, 25 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0) at 4 °C. Cells were disrupted by passing them twice through a French press cell (SLM Aminco) at 20,000 pounds/square inch. The cytosolic fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. This supernatant was then further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to remove any residual membrane material. An equal volume of 90% saturated ammonium sulfate (4 °C) was gradually added to the cytosol with stirring, followed by additional stirring at 4 °C for 30 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 23,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein pellet was redissolved in 20 ml of buffer B to a protein concentration of approximately 28 mg/ml. An aliquot (5 ml) of the redissolved ammonium sulfate pellet was loaded onto a Superdex-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column (1.5 cm in diameter × 58 cm in height, 102-ml bed volume), pre-equilibrated at 4 °C with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmdisodium EDTA, pH 8.0). The column was eluted at 18 ml/h, and fractions of 1.2-ml were collected. The activity was eluted at fractions 49–58, and these fractions were pooled and stored at 4 °C. The material from 4 column runs was combined to use in the following step. The active pool from the Superdex-200 column (total volume of 48 ml) was loaded onto a DE52 anion-exchange column (Whatman; 2 cm in diameter × 12.7 cm in height, 40-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated at 4 °C with buffer C. After sample loading, the column was washed with 3 column volumes of the equilibration buffer. The enzyme was then eluted with a linear sodium chloride gradient (0–0.8 m in the equilibration buffer, total of 250 ml) followed by a 5 column volumes of a high salt wash (1.0 m sodium chloride in the equilibration buffer) at 4 °C. The flow rate was 19.5 ml/h, and 2.8-ml fractions were collected. Activity was found to elute between sodium chloride concentrations of 300 and 400 mm between fractions 102 and 112. These active fractions were pooled and stored at 4 °C. Potassium monobasic phosphate was dissolved in concentrated buffer C, the pH was adjusted to 8.1 with KOH, and the solution was diluted to give a final concentration of 1 m phosphate in buffer C. This solution was added to the active pool from the DE52 anion-exchange column to bring the potassium phosphate concentration to 0.6 m. This material was then applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1 cm diameter × 10 cm height, 7.8-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with 0.6 m potassium phosphate in buffer C. The flow rate was 18 ml/h, and 2.5-ml fractions were collected. After loading the sample, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of the equilibration buffer and then eluted with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate (0.6–0 m in the equilibration buffer). Enzyme activity was found to elute between 0 and 0.1 m potassium phosphate concentrations. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed by Dr. Audree Fowler at the UCLA Protein Microsequencing Facility with a Porton 2090E gas-phase sequencer with on-line HPLC detection. The active pool from the DE52 column (fractions 103–110, total volume of 19.6 ml) was added to an equal volume of 25% (w/w) trichloroacetic acid, mixed well by vortexing, and incubated at 4 °C while rotating slowly overnight. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the protein pellet was then dissolved in 100 μl of 1× sample buffer for SDS gel electrophoresis (Ref. 10Sambrook J. Fristsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, section 18.47–18.55). After polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the separated polypeptides were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 25 mm Tris base, 10 mm glycine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, in 10% methanol, 90% water (v/v) at pH 9. This membrane was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, and the polypeptide band at 29 kDa corresponding to the trans-aconitate methyltransferase was excised and subjected to automated Edman sequencing. A 3.1-kb DNA fragment containing the entiretrans-aconitate methyltransferase gene (o252) and flanking regions was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from template DNA in MC1000 cells (12Gussow D. Clackson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) using Taq polymerase (Promega) at 2.5 mm magnesium chloride and an annealing temperature of 60 °C. The primers were KO-5 (5′-TATGACTACGAAGCGGATCCTAATGGCA, corresponding to bases −1362 to −1335 from the translation start site of o252with the underlined nucleotides changed to create a BamHI site) and KO-3 (5′-GCGTATTGAGAATGGGATCCTAATCACG corresponding to the reverse complement of bases 1714–1741 with the underlined nucleotides changed to prevent hairpin formation and to create another BamHI site). This fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis using Geneclean II (Bio 101), cut withBamHI, and then ligated into the BamHI site within the multicloning site of the pUC19 vector to generate the plasmid pHC108 (Table I). This plasmid, pHC108, was then used to construct a null mutation in the o252 gene by blunt-end ligation of a 1.5-kb chloramphenicol resistance (Cm r) cassette (13Gary J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4076-4087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) at the uniqueAgeI site within the gene to create pHC109. The chromosomalo252 gene was then replaced with theCm r disrupted gene in pHC109 by homologous recombination in strain JC7623, which does not support plasmid replication (14Winans S.C. Elledge S.J. Krueger J.H. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pHC109 was transformed into CaCl2-competent JC7623 cells, and Cmr colonies were selected on a plate containing 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The loss of the vector in the recipient strain was confirmed by screening for ampicillin sensitivity. This disrupted o252 gene was subsequently transduced into the MC1000 background by P1 transduction (15Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 107-108Google Scholar). The disruption of the o252 gene was confirmed by the PCR amplification of a 3.96-kb product using a primer (5′-GATTCAGTACGCCAAATGTG) corresponding to genomic sequence upstream of the KO-5 primer described above and a primer OE-3 (described below) corresponding to a sequence downstream of the stop codon foro252 gene. We also confirmed the disruption by the detection of the expected 3.44-kb EcoRV, 6.35-kb HindIII, and 0.60- and 1.35-kb EcoRI fragments using a random-primed probe corresponding to the Cm r gene in Southern blot hybridization (data not shown). The trans-aconitate methyltransferase gene was PCR-amplified from colonies of E. coli strain MC1000 as described above using the primers OE-5 (5′- CGGGAGTAAACATATGTCTGACTGG; corresponding to bases −13 to +12 from the translation start site with the underlined bases changed to create a 5′ NdeI site) and OE-3 (5′-ACCACTGGATCCCATATGCAACGC; corresponding to the reverse complement of bases +848 to +871 with the underlined based changed to create a BamHI site and to prevent hairpin formation; the stop codon is located at bases +757 to +759). The 884-base pair PCR fragment was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI and the large fragment purified as described above. This fragment was then cloned into the corresponding sites in the multicloning site of the pT7-7 vector (16Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) to generate pHC107. DNA sequence analysis using both oligonucleotides described above as primers showed that no mutations were introduced during the cloning procedure. The plasmid was then transferred into BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) for expression. An aliquot of an overnight culture of the transformed cells (20 μl) was diluted into 20 ml of fresh LB medium, incubated with shaking at 37 °C, and cultured to anA 600 nm of 1.0. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to the culture, and the cells were incubated with shaking for another 2 h. Cytosolic fractions were then prepared and assayed for trans-aconitate methyltransferase activity as described above. The enzymatic activity of this preparation was 100–150 nmol/min/ml (specific activity 12–22 nmol/min/mg protein), and it was used as a concentrated source of enzyme in the enzyme kinetic assays and in the experiments to characterize the methyl acceptors. A control extract was prepared where the same strain was grown in the absence of plasmid. The specific activity of this extract was 0.020 nmol/min/mg protein, indicating that the degree of overexpression was about 630-fold. Analysis of the substrates and products was carried out with a Waters HPLC system. An Alltech Partisil SAX anion-exchange column (250 mm length × 4.6 mm inner diameter; 10-μm resin bead diameter) was used for initial separations. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 4.5, and eluted at 1 ml/min at room temperature. After each run, the column was regenerated with 500 mm potassium phosphate, pH 4.5, prior to re-equilibration with the starting buffer. For reverse-phase separations, an Alltech Econosphere C18 column (250 mm length × 4.6 mm inner diameter; 5-μm spherical resin bead diameter) was used in a two-solvent system. Solvent A is 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B is 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 99.5% acetonitrile, and 0.4% water. The column was eluted at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min for 20 min in solvent A, followed by a linear gradient over 20 min from 100% solvent A to 100% solvent B, followed by 10 min of 100% solvent B. The column was re-equilibrated with 100% buffer A. In each case, 1-min fractions were collected. The UV profile was monitored by Waters model 441 absorbance detector at 214 nm, and chromatographs were recorded with the PowerChrom system from ADInstruments. Radiolabeled products were detected by counting 100 μl of each in 5 ml of scintillation fluid. Thin layer chromatography was also used to analyze the products of the methylation reaction after the method of Otten and Mehltretter (17Otten J.G. Mehltretter C.L. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 35: 302-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Polyester-based 60-Å silica gel-coated plates were used (Whatman PE SIL G, 250 μm layer). The solvent is benzene/methanol/acetic acid (45:16:4, v/v/v) and is prepared fresh daily and used to pre-equilibrate the chamber for 2 h before each run at room temperature. Samples (1–5 μl) were spotted in each lane in 1-μl aliquots, and each spot was allowed to air-dry before further application of sample or chromatography. The solvent front was allowed to migrate approximately 18 cm on the plate, then its position was marked and the plate was air-dried in a hood, followed by baking at 105 °C in a vacuum oven for 1 h. Carboxylic acid-containing compounds were detected as yellow spots on a blue background after spraying the plate with 0.04% bromcresol green dissolved in 95% ethanol, pH 8.0. trans-Aconitic acid (4.8 mg) was incubated with 60 μl of methanol and 1 μl of concentrated (12 m) HCl for 16 h at room temperature. The sample was vacuum-dried in Speedvac apparatus and dissolved in 138 μl of H2O to give a final concentration oftrans-aconitate derivatives of 0.2 m. An aliquot of the sample (10 μl) was chromatographed on the SAX HPLC anion-exchange column as described above. The peaks were collected, and an aliquot of each peak was re-chromatographed on the C18 reverse-phase column as described. The reaction mixture contains 5 μl of 0.02 m trans-aconitate in 0.4 msodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 μl of 0.4 m sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 μl of a preparation of cytosol from BL21 cells overexpressing the trans-aconitate methyltransferase (7.72 μg protein, 12.6 pmol/min/μg protein), 17.5 μl of 8.16 mm S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) in water, and 2.5 μl [14C]AdoMet to a total volume of 42.5 μl made up by H2O. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h. Forty μl of the sample was purified as described above. The methylated trans-aconitate was followed by radioactivity. Mass spectroscopy was performed by Dr. Kym Faull at the UCLA Mass Spectrometry Facility. HPLC fractions from the C18 reverse-phase column were collected and dried in a SpeedVac. The dried HPLC samples were redissolved in 20 μl of water/acetonitrile/triethylamine (50:50:0.1, v/v/v), and aliquots were injected into an electrospray ionization source attached to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Thornhill, Canada, API III; −3.5 Kv ion spray voltage, spray nebulization with hydrocarbon-depleted air (“zero” grade air, 40 pounds/square inch, 0.6 liters/min; Zero Air Generator, Peak Scientific, Chicago, IL), curtain gas (0.6 liters/min) from the vapors of liquid nitrogen; mass resolution set so the isotopes of the polypropylene glycol/NH4+ singly charged ion atm/z 906 were resolved with 40% valley) scanning fromm/z 120–250 in the negative ion mode. Spectra were collected (step size 0.3 Da, dwell time 20 ms/step, 6.7 s/scan, orifice at −60 V), and the resulting spectra were summed then background subtracted with software supplied with the instrument. In the course of studies quantitating proteinl-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase activity in various strains, we measured methyl esterification in cytosolic extracts in the presence and absence of addedl-isoaspartyl-containing methyl-accepting peptide KASA(isoD)LAKY. [14C]Methyl esters formed when extracts are incubated with [14C]AdoMet in a sodium citrate buffer were hydrolyzed in base to generate volatile [14C]methanol that can be separated from unreacted [14C]AdoMet and other non-volatile species and quantitated. Although we found that the l-isoaspartyl peptide-dependent activity correlated well with the presence of the pcm gene for the isoaspartyl methyltransferase, we were surprised to find that the “endogenous” activity in the absence of added peptide was much higher in extracts from strains with an intact rpoS gene than in extracts from strains mutated in this gene (Table II). The rpoS gene is located about a kilobase downstream from the pcm gene and codes for a specific ς factor that is required for the expression of a number of genes in stationary phase cells (for a review, see Ref. 18Loewen P.C. Hengge-Aronis R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 53-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). This result suggested that eitherrpoS or one of the genes it regulates might also have a methyl esterification activity.Table IIEndogenous and isoaspartyl peptide-dependent methyl esterification activityCytosolsRelevant genotypeEndogenous methyltransferase activityEndogenous + peptide-dependent methyltransferase activityPeptide-dependent methyltransferase activitypmol/min/mgaActivity was calculated as picomoles of methyl groups transferred per min per mg of cytosolic protein.pmol/min/mgpmol/min/mgbPeptide-dependent activities were calculated for each pair of samples and were then averaged.MC1000pcm+rpoS+4.1 ± 1.07.0 ± 2.03.3 ± 0.2JV1012pcm+ rpoS−0.2 ± 0.24.4 ± 0.33.6 ± 0.5CL1010pcm− rpoS−0.5 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.1HC1011pcm− rpoS+3.2 ± 0.43.6 ± 0.80.05 ± 0.04E. coli cytosolic fractions were made as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Endogenous activity was measured in the citrate buffer as described.

Peptide-dependent activity was calculated as the difference between the endogenous and peptide-containing activities. Results are expressed with the standard deviations obtained from three parallel experiments. We then began to investigate the nature of the RpoS-dependent endogenous methyl esterification activity using extracts of the strain HC1011 that lacks the pcm gene so there would be no contribution of the l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase to the methylation activity. We found that about 78% of the total activity was localized in the cytosolic fraction, and 22% of the activity was found in the membrane pellet fraction. The combination of membrane and cytosolic fractions did not increase the activity over that of cytosolic fractions alone (data not shown). The production of the endogenous methylated product from cytosolic extracts was found to be linear with time and with the amount of cytosolic extract used (data not shown). The activity appeared to be a protein because treatment of the extract with proteinase K resulted in a complete loss of activity and because heating the extract greatly reduced the activity. Finally, we showed that the activity could be inhibited by S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, a product of the reaction and an effective inhibitor of most AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (19Borchardt R.T. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We found 72% inhibition with 0.38 mm S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and essentially complete inhibition at 0.94 mm (data not shown). The formation of volatile radioactivity by the RpoS-dependent methyltransferase in the assay described above was dependent upon hydrolysis of the reaction products, suggesting that a methyl ester linkage was formed. No radioactivity was detected when water replaced the 2 m NaOH quenching solution. There was no increase in activity when 7 m NaOH was used as a quench; 74% of the activity was detected with 1 m NaOH and only 49% activity found with 0.2 m NaOH. Only 2, 3, and 8% of the maximum activity was found when 1, 2, and 7 m"
https://openalex.org/W2007595691,"High levels of insulin-like growth factor II (IGFII) mRNA expression are detected in many human tumors of different origins including rhabdomyosarcoma, a tumor of skeletal muscle origin. To investigate the role of IGFII in tumorigenesis, we have compared the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12-2.7, which was stably transfected with human IGFII cDNA and expressed high and constant amounts of IGFII, to a control cell line C2C12-1.1. A rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, RH30, which expresses high levels of IGFII and contains mutated p53, was also used in these studies. IGFII overexpression in mouse myoblast C2C12 cells causes a reduced cycling time and higher growth rate. After γ-irradiation treatment, C2C12-1.1 cells were arrested mainly in G0/G1 phase. However, C2C12-2.7 and RH30 cells went through a very short G1 phase and then were arrested in an extended G2/M phase. To verify further the effect of IGFII on the cell cycle, we developed a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line with tetracycline-controlled IGFII expression. We found that CHO cells with high expression of IGFII have a shortened cycling time and a diminished G1 checkpoint after treatment with methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), a DNA base-damaging agent, when compared with CHO cells with very low IGFII expression. It was also found that IGFII overexpression in C2C12 cells was associated with increases in cyclin D1, p21, and p53 protein levels, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. These studies suggest that IGFII overexpression shortens cell cycling time and diminishes the G1 checkpoint after DNA damage despite an intact p53/p21 induction. In addition, IGFII overexpression is also associated with multiple changes in the levels and activities of cell cycle regulatory components following γ-irradiation. Taken together, these changes may contribute to the high growth rate and genetic alterations that occur during tumorigenesis.

Moreover, elevated levels of IGFII have been detected in human tumors of various origins and may act through autocrine or paracrine signaling loops, which are often associated with increased levels of type I IGF receptor (3Bhatavdekar J.M.

In a transgenic carcinogenesis model involving simian virus 40 T antigen targeted to pancreatic β-islet cells, the initial proliferation switch is correlated with focal activation of IGFII, and reduced IGFII expression impairs tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo (8Christofori G. Naik P. Hanahan D. Nature. 1994; 369: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In addition, IGFII is further up-regulated in all pancreatic islet-cell tumors in the T antigen transgenic mice, and Igf2 gene disrupted mice developed fewer tumors of reduced size, a lower grade malignancy, and higher number of apoptotic cell bodies (8Christofori G. Naik P. Hanahan D. Nature. 1994; 369: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). IGFII may also act as a survival factor and inhibits apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation, DNA damage, and a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, although this anti-apoptotic activity may not be a primary consequence of IGFII signaling (9Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. J. Biol.

The anti-apoptotic activity of IGFII could promote the accumulation of additional genetic abnormalities that lead to cell proliferation.Cell cycle progression of eukaryotic cells is finely regulated by an intrinsic molecular clock comprised of cyclins and cyclin-associated kinases (12Murray A. Hunt T. The Cell Cycle. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1993: 3-32Google Scholar). The final decision of mammalian cells to replicate their DNA or to withdraw from the cell cycle with an unduplicated genome takes place in mid- to late G1 phase, referred to as the restriction point (13Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). The commitment process at the G1checkpoint reflects a complicated integration of positive and negative extracellular and intracellular signals transduced by multiple cascades into the cell nucleus (14Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 15Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 16Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 17Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar). The existence of internal checkpoints at different stages of the cell cycle is an important feature to prevent the cell from prematurely entering the next phase before all the necessary macromolecular events have been completed. A key regulatory component of cell cycle progression is the tumor suppressor p53 which is normally expressed at very low levels in many different tissues due to the short half-life of the protein (18Oren M. Maltzman W. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Following DNA damage, p53 protein levels rise dramatically and promote the transcription of WAF1/CIP1 gene, the product of which, p21WAF1CIP1, causes growth arrest and delayed entry into the S phase until the genomic lesions are fully repaired (19Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar, 20Smith M.L. Fornace Jr., A.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 69-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).When growth factors interact with their receptors at the cell surface, a cascade of phosphorylation events is triggered which transduce mitogenic signals to the nucleus, leading to DNA synthesis and subsequently to mitosis. Since all these extracellular stimuli must ultimately pass their signals to the cell cycle machinery itself, it is important to investigate the effects of growth factors on the cell cycle and to understand the molecular basis of the link between the upstream signaling pathways and the cell cycle clock. In our studies, we examined the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12, stably transfected with human IGFII cDNA, CHO cells with tetracycline-regulated IGFII expression, and a RMS cell line, RH30, which expresses high levels of IGFII and contains mutated p53. After DNA damage, cells with IGFII overexpression had a diminished G1 checkpoint arrest and an amplified G2/M phase despite intact p53/p21 induction. We also found that IGFII overexpression was associated with increases in basal levels of cyclin D1, p21, and p53 proteins, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. These effects of IGFII on the cell cycle may contribute to the high proliferation rate and accumulation of genetic changes during tumorigenesis.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the IGFII mitogenic signaling pathway shortens the G1 interval and appears to inhibit the block of the G1-to-S transition following DNA damage. IGFII overexpression is associated with relatively high cdk kinase activity after DNA damage which enables high IGFII expressing cells to quickly override the G1 checkpoint. This short G1checkpoint arrest may lead to the lack of appropriate repair of damaged DNA, and subsequent propagation of genetic alterations may contribute to genetic instability in tumor cells overexpressing IGFII. Furthermore, the increased percentage of IGFII overexpressing cells in S and G2/M phase indicates that the cells have a higher proliferative rate.We also found that cyclin D1 levels were increased in IGFII overexpressing cells which indicates that cyclin D1 may be a downstream target of the IGFII signaling pathway. Since cyclin D1 is required and is a rate-limiting factor for entry into S phase, the overexpression of cyclin D1 may accelerate the G1-to-S transition in high IGFII expressing cells (24Musgrove E.A.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Many alterations in G1-associated processes have been observed in cancer cells, of which cyclin D1 overexpression is the most common (27Jiang W. Kahn S.M. Tomita N. Zhang Y.J. Lu S.H. Weinstein I.B.

Overexpression of cyclin D1 contributes to the oncogenic transformation of cells in vitro and in vivo (31Bodrug S.E. Warner B.J. Bath M.L. Linderman G.J. Harris A.W. Adams J.M.

Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Induction of cyclin D expression is part of the mitogenic response of various mesenchymal or epithelial cells to serum or growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, epithelial growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor I (35Furlamento R.W. Harwell S.E. Frick K.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 510-517PubMed Google Scholar, 36Musgrove E.A. Hamilton J.A. Lee C.S.L. Sweeney K.J.E. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell.

Pledger W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1133-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All of these mitogens operate via signaling cascades involving tyrosine kinase receptors and G proteins at least in part through the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway (14Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 15Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 16Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The role of D-type cyclins as potential sensors and integrators of diverse mitogenic stimuli with the cell cycle machinery is also confirmed by induction of cyclin D1 expression and G1 phase acceleration by activated ras or raf oncogenes themselves (39Liu J.-J. Chao J.-R. Jiang M.-C. Ng S.-Y. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 40Winston J.T. Coats S.R. Wang Y.-Z. Pledger W.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar).Another significant finding of this study is that the p21 and p53 proteins are constitutively expressed in the high IGFII-expressing cell line C2C12-2.7. The increase of p21 expression corresponds to an increased level of p21 mRNA. Despite the elevated basal levels of p53 and p21 protein, the proliferation rate of IGFII-overexpressing cells was higher compared with the control C2C12 cells. It has previously been reported that ectopic expression of cyclin D1 in asynchronously growing cells was accompanied by increased levels of the p53 tumor suppressor protein as well as the cyclin/cdk inhibitor p21 through an E2F transactivation mechanism (41Hiyama H. Iavarone A. Reeves S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 42Hiyama H. Iavarone A. LaBaer J. Reeves S.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2533-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The induction of p21 does not lead to growth arrest of cells but rather to stabilization of cyclin D1/cdk function (41Hiyama H. Iavarone A. Reeves S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 42Hiyama H. Iavarone A. LaBaer J. Reeves S.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2533-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is known that p21 does not always function as an inhibitor of cyclin-cdk complexes. At low concentrations, p21 promotes the assembly of stable and active Cdk4 and D-type cyclin kinase complexes which allows the cells to continue to enter into S phase, resulting in a transformed phenotype. At high concentrations, such as following the stress of DNA damage, p21 inhibits kinase activity and cell growth (43Fan Z. Lu Y. Wu X. DeBlasio A. Koff A. Mendelsohn J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 44LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 45Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar, 46Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). A proposed explanation for this paradox is that cyclin D1-cdk complexes containing a single p21 molecule are still catalytically active, whereas complexes containing multiple p21 subunits are inactive (46Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 47Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connel-Crowley L. Swindell E. Fox M.P. Wei N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). We found that following DNA damage, the relative increases in both p53 and p21 were higher in C2C12-1.1 cells than the increases in IGFII overexpressing C2C12-2.7 cells, which may lead to the longer G1 checkpoint arrest in C2C12-1.1 cells compared with C2C12-2.7 cells. Following γ-irradiation, cdk activities are decreased in both cell lines. However, the inhibition of cdks in high IGFII-expressing C2C12-2.7 cells is diminished. This may be explained by two factors: higher cyclin D1 levels in IGFII-overexpressing C2C12-2.7 cells and a relative lower increase in p21 protein associated in all the cdk complexes after radiation when compared with C2C12-1.1 cells. Thus the ratio of p21 to cyclin D1-cdk complexes in IGFII-overexpressing C2C12-2.7 cells following DNA damage is less than the ratio in C2C12–1.1 control cells, which potentially leads to maintenance of stable, active cyclin D1-cdk-p21 complexes in C2C12-2.7 cells following γ-irradiation.It has been widely reported that expression of p21 is induced in a p53-dependent manner in response to DNA damage, resulting in G1/S arrest through inhibition of the cyclin-cdk complexes (48Dulic V.

On the other hand, p21 gene expression is also induced through a p53-independent mechanism during differentiation of a number of cell types, as well as in various murine tissues during development and in the adult animal (50Halevy O.

Science. 1995; 267: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was reported that expression of p21 is elevated following stimulation of quiescent cells with serum or purified growth factors, and in proliferating cells the majority of p21 protein is found in active cyclin-cdk complexes (46Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 52Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G. Beach D. Tokino T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Jacks T.

Induction of p21 in these situations does not appear to require p53. In addition, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 correlated with increased levels of p21 protein, which did not lead to growth arrest (42Hiyama H. Iavarone A. LaBaer J. Reeves S.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2533-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been reported that higher levels of p21 protein and RNA are observed in several different human tumors compared with the corresponding normal tissues and that the p21 is not mutated in these tumors, although the p21 gene possesses a polymorphism at codon 31 (55Marchetti A. Doglioni C. Barbareschi M. Buttitta F. Pellegrini S. Bertacca G. Chella A. Merlo G. Angeletti C.A. Palma P.D. Bevilacqua G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1319-1324PubMed Google Scholar). The elevated p21 expression is related to tumor differentiation and is p53-independent, which is a common feature of in vivoneoplasms (55Marchetti A. Doglioni C. Barbareschi M. Buttitta F. Pellegrini S. Bertacca G. Chella A. Merlo G. Angeletti C.A. Palma P.D. Bevilacqua G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1319-1324PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our findings support the evidence that the stoichiometry of cyclin D1-cdk-p21 is critical in determining the activity of this complex.We also observed that MAPK activity was induced in high IGFII-expressing C2C12-2.7 cells, which may be a result of the activation of the IGFII signaling pathway. It has been reported that the MAPK pathway signals, including Ras, Raf, MAPKK, and MAPK, can all transcriptionally induce p21 expression in response to growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, serum, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment (54Liu Y. Martindale J.L. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 31-35PubMed Google Scholar). This report is consistent with the findings that forced expression of either v-Src or activated c-Raf in murine hematopoietic Baf-3 cells prevents down-regulation of p21 expression that normally occurs in these cells in response to growth factor withdrawal (56Canman C.E. Gilmer T.M. Coutts S.B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In combination with other results in our study, it could be suggested that IGFII may directly activate mitogenic signaling pathways and drive cell cycle progression. However, it still remains to be investigated whether increased MAPK activity contributes to the elevated expression of cyclin D1, p21, and p53 in IGFII-overexpressing C2C12-2.7 cells.It has been shown that E2F-1 can strongly transactivate the human p21 gene through E2F-binding sites that are located in the p21 gene and that the transactivation of the p21 gene is correlated with increased levels of endogenous E2F-1 and p21 proteins at the G1/S boundary (46Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Curiously, we observed a lower molecular weight E2F-1 portion associated with the induced p21 protein levels seen in high IGFII expression cells compared with control cells. However, the role of E2F-1 in the regulation of p21 expression is not yet known. We did not observe obvious differences of cyclin E protein between high IGFII-expressing cells and control cells with or without DNA damage. Although cyclin E is also rate-limiting for entry into S phase and may contribute to phosphorylation of pRb, its peak abundance and its associated Cdk2 appears to function at the G1/S transition by phosphorylating some currently unknown substrate(s) other than pRb (37Resnitzky D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 45Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar, 57Hofman F. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 58Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we found that IGFII overexpression in mammalian cells causes a shortened cycling time and increases in cyclin D1, p21, and p53 protein levels as well as increases in MAPK activity. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction of these proteins by IGFII overexpression and whether the increased levels of cyclin D1, p53, as well as MAPK activity participate directly or indirectly in the p21 induction are still under investigation. Following DNA damage, IGFII overexpression is associated with a diminished G1checkpoint, which may contribute to the high growth rate and genetic alterations during tumorigenesis.

IGFII is encoded by the imprinted Igf2gene expressed only from the paternal allele in most tissues (1DeChiara T.M. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1991; 64: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The signaling of IGFII is mediated by the type I IGF receptor. We have previously shown that forced overexpression of IGFII in C2C12 cells leads to transformed characteristics (2Minniti C.P. Luan D. O'Grady C. Rosenfeld R.G. Oh Y. Helman L.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 263-269PubMed Google Scholar). IGFII expressing cells exhibit a proliferative advantage. Moreover, elevated levels of IGFII have been detected in human tumors of various origins and may act through autocrine or paracrine signaling loops, which are often associated with increased levels of type I IGF receptor (3Bhatavdekar J.M.

In a transgenic carcinogenesis model involving simian virus 40 T antigen targeted to pancreatic β-islet cells, the initial proliferation switch is correlated with focal activation of IGFII, and reduced IGFII expression impairs tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo (8Christofori G. Naik P. Hanahan D. Nature. 1994; 369: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In addition, IGFII is further up-regulated in all pancreatic islet-cell tumors in the T antigen transgenic mice, and Igf2 gene disrupted mice developed fewer tumors of reduced size, a lower grade malignancy, and higher number of apoptotic cell bodies (8Christofori G.

IGFII may also act as a survival factor and inhibits apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation, DNA damage, and a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, although this anti-apoptotic activity may not be a primary consequence of IGFII signaling (9Singleton J.R.

Trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMADH, EC1.5.99.7), 1The abbreviations used are: TMADH, trimethylamine dehydrogenase; FMN, flavin mononucleotide; TMAC, tetramethylammonium chloride. an iron-sulfur containing flavoprotein from the bacterium Methylophilus methylotrophus (sp. W3A1), catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of trimethylamine to dimethylamine and formaldehyde. The enzyme is a homodimer, and each subunit contains an unusual covalently linked 6-S-cysteinyl FMN cofactor and a bacterial ferredoxin-type 4Fe/4S center, as well as 1 equivalent of tightly bound ADP of unknown function (1Steenkamp D.J.

In the crystal structure of TMADH, Tyr-169 lies in van der Waals contact with the pyrimidine ring of the flavin cofactor, and is hydrogen-bonded to His-172 (which is also in van der Waals contact with the flavin). In order to ascertain the catalytic significance of Tyr-169 in TMADH, we have isolated a Y169F mutant enzyme and analyzed its kinetic behavior. We find that mutation of this residue to phenylalanine reduces the limiting rate constant for flavin reduction by a factor of approximately 100, but does not function as an active site base. The mutation also significantly reduces the ability of the flavin semiquinone to interact magnetically with the reduced 4Fe/4S center of the two-electron reduced enzyme. This is due to a substantial decrease in the equilibrium amount of enzyme possessing flavin semiquinone and reduced 4Fe/4S center, presumably by perturbing the semiquinone/hydroquinone half-potential of the active site flavin, and a decrease in the magnetic interaction between the centers in mutant enzymes possessing this electron distribution. The result suggests that Tyr-169 in all likelihood represents the ionizable group of pK a ∼ 9.5, previously identified in pH-jump studies of electron transfer (22Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whose deprotonation must occur for the spin-interaction state to be established. Complex bacteriological media were from Unipath and all media were prepared as described by Sambrooket al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Trimethylamine, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, phenazine methosulfate, tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC), and all buffers were from Sigma. Sodium dithionite was obtained from Virginia Chemicals. Perdeuterated trimethylamine HCl (99.7% D) was from CK Gas Products Ltd. All other chemicals were of analytical grade where possible. Wild-type TMADH was purified from M. methylotrophus as described by Steenkamp and Mallinson (1Steenkamp D.J. Mallinson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and modified by Wilson et al. (24Wilson E.K. Mathews F.S. Packman L.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2584-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The concentration of wild-type enzyme was determined using an extinction coefficient of 27.3 mm−1 cm−1 at 443 nm in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Recombinant Y169F TMADH was generated and isolated as described elsewhere (14Basran J. Mewies M. Mathews F.S. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and expressed using the plasmid pSV2tmdveg (11Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this expression system, the enzyme as isolated possesses its full complement of 4Fe/4S center and ADP, but a significant portion of the enzyme lacks the flavin (25Packman L.C. Mewies M. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13186-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Mewies M. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using spectrophotometric methods reported elsewhere (11Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the fraction of flavinylated enzyme in the Y169F preparations used in the present study was estimated as approximately 50%; the mutant enzyme was found to be stoichiometrically assembled with the 4Fe/4S center and ADP. The concentration of the Y169F mutant of TMADH was determined using an effective extinction coefficient (20.0 mm−1 cm−1 at 443 nm) for oxidized enzyme, calculated from the extent of the spectral change elicited by excess substrate (only the flavinylated enzyme is reducible by substrate). Enzyme solutions of the desired pH were obtained by adding microliter volumes of a concentrated enzyme stock to buffer at the desired pH. The 4Fe/4S center of TMADH was selectively inactivated by treatment with ferricenium hexafluorophosphate at pH 10, essentially as described by Huang et al. (27Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The protein (30 μm) was incubated with ferricenium hexafluorophosphate (3 mm) contained in 50 mm potassium borate buffer, pH 10, at room temperature for 6 h. Excess oxidant was removed by size-exclusion chromatography using Sephadex G-25 equilibrated in 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The flavin site of TMADH treated in this way remains reducible by trimethylamine, but the 4Fe/4S enter becomes redox inert and the enzyme is unable to pass electrons on to electron-transferring flavoprotein (27Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). UV/visible spectra were recorded using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A single-beam diode array spectrophotometer. EPR spectra were obtained using a Brüker ER 300 EPR spectrometer equipped with a ER035M gaussmeter and a Hewlett-Packard 5352B microwave frequency counter. Instrument settings were 9.45 GHz microwave frequency, 1.00 mW microwave power, 10 G field modulation, and 100 kHz modulation amplitude. Temperature was maintained at 15 K using a Brüker ER 4112HV liquid helium cryostat with an Oxford Instruments ITC4 temperature controller. EPR samples were prepared as follows: 300 μl of enzyme solutions at the desired pH were placed in quartz EPR tubes using a long-needle Hamilton syringe, then treated with either 20–30 μl of a concentrated substrate solution prepared in the same buffer (sufficient to give at least 5-fold stoichiometric excess over the enzyme) or with a comparable amount of TMAC followed by reduction with sodium dithionite. For the substrate-reduced samples, a final enzyme concentration of 100 μm was used for the wild-type while 200 μmwas used for Y169F to compensate for the incomplete flavinylation in this mutant protein to facilitate direct comparisons in the data. UV/visible spectra of each sample were recorded before and after each addition using a special spectrophotometer cell holder, which accommodates EPR tubes. Samples were then thoroughly mixed and slowly frozen by hand in liquid nitrogen. EPR spectra were recorded at both half- and high-field (in separate sweeps) for each sample. Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed with a 1-cm light path in a final volume of 1 ml. The desired concentrations of trimethylamine, phenazine methosulfate, and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol were obtained by making microliter additions from stock solutions to the assay mixture. Assays were performed in 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.5. Reaction was initiated by the addition of substrate, and the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm due to reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (ε = 21, 900m−1 cm−1) was measured using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. All data were collected at 30 °C. Data were fitted to the appropriate rate equation using the fitting program Grafit (28Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit version 2.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1990Google Scholar). Rapid kinetic experiments were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX.17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Time-dependent reduction of TMADH by trimethylamine at pH 6.5 and 7.0 was performed using a photodiode array detector. Spectral deconvolution was perfomed by global analysis and numerical integration methods using PROKIN software (Applied Photophysics). For single wavelength studies, data collected at 443 nm were analyzed using nonlinear least squares regression on an Archimedes 410-1 microcomputer using Spectrakinetics software (Applied Photophysics). Experiments were performed by mixing TMADH in buffer of the desired pH, with an equal volume of trimethylamine at the desired concentration in the same buffer. The concentration of substrate was always at least 10-fold greater than that of TMADH, thereby ensuring pseudo first-order conditions. For each substrate concentration used, at least four replicate measurements were collected and averaged. Substrate-reduced TMADH is quite stable to reoxidation in aerobic environments (half-life about 50 min, Ref. 24Wilson E.K. Mathews F.S. Packman L.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2584-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and consequently these stopped-flow experiments were carried out under aerobic conditions. The absorbance change at 443 nm for Y169F TMADH at values of pH > 7.0 was essentially monophasic, with a single rate constant obtained from fits of the data to Equation 1,A443=Ce−kobs1t+b(Eq. 1) where C is a constant related to the initial absorbance and b is an offset value to account for a non-zero baseline. Below pH 7, however, kinetic transients for Y169F TMADH were biphasic and best fit as the sum of two exponentials using Equation 2,A443=C1e−kobs1t+C2e−kobs2t+b(Eq. 2) where k obs1 and k obs2 are the observed rate constants for the faster and slower phases, respectively, and C 1and C 2 are related to the initial absorbance; again, b is an offset. The observed rate constants were found to exhibit hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration and the reaction sequence was modeled as shown in the general scheme,TMADHox+TMA⇄KdTMADHox·TMA→klimTMADHred+P(Eq. 3) Data were then fitted to obtain related K dand k lim values usingk obs =k lim[S]/(K d + [S]) (29Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As reported previously, the steady-state kinetics of wild-type TMADH exhibit excess substrate inhibition (18Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Falzon L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 31Steenkamp D.J. Beinert H. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By contrast, Y169F TMADH exhibits well behaved steady-state behavior: no evidence for substrate inhibition was seen even at very high substrate concentrations (up to 45 mm; Fig. 1). The kinetic parameters KmTMA and k cat for the mutant protein are 63 ± 3 μm and 2.6 ± 0.03 s−1 at pH 8.5 and 30 °C, which are approximately 5-fold higher and 6-fold lower, respectively, than those determined for the wild-type enzyme (13.7 ± 1.7 μm and 15.6 ± 2.4 s−1, respectively; Ref. 14Basran J. Mewies M. Mathews F.S. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The results suggest that Tyr-169 plays only a relatively small role in the overall catalytic efficiency of the enzyme in the steady-state. Reduction of the flavin in Y169F TMADH by substrate was examined by stopped-flow spectroscopy at 443 nm over the pH range 6.0 to 11.0. Unlike wild-type enzyme, in which flavin reduction is essentially monophasic over this pH range (18Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), flavin reduction in Y169F is biphasic below pH 7.0 (Fig. 2). At pH 7.0, it is monophasic at high substrate concentrations but biphasic at [TMA] < 20 mm, suggesting that ionic strength may influence the kinetic behavior. To explore this possibility, the reaction was repeated in lower ionic strength buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer instead of 100 mm, pH 7.0) and biphasic kinetic transients are seen even at high substrate concentrations. However, the limiting rate constant for flavin reduction (faster phase of the biphasic reaction or the single kinetic phase in monophasic reaction) is essentially unchanged. The effect of ionic strength is therefore restricted to controlling the range of substrate concentration over which biphasic kinetic behavior is seen (probably by influencing a kinetically relevant ionization; see below) rather than influencing the limiting rate of flavin reduction. An analysis of the amplitudes for each of the two phases seen at pH 7.0 and below indicates that the slower kinetic phase becomes increasingly prominent as pH decreases. The two kinetic phases also become more clearly resolved, principally due to a decrease in the rate constant for the slower phase. The pH dependence of the amplitudes for the two phases indicates the presence of a kinetically influential ionization of apparent pK a 6.2 ± 0.2 (Fig. 2,inset). While there will be small differences in ionic strength across the pH range used for the determination of this value, these are not expected to compromise the analysis significantly. The reductive half-reaction of wild-type TMADH with TMA is triphasic (18Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, at the end of this half-reaction, the distribution of the two electrons derived from substrate in the enzyme is affected by pH (22Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rohlfs R.J. Huang L. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22196-22207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar): at high pH (pH 7.5 and above), formation of flavin semiquinone and reduced 4Fe/4S center is favored; at low pH (e.g. pH 6.5), dihydroflavin and oxidized 4Fe/4S center is preferred, reducing the overall kinetics to nearly monophasic behavior. Similar pH effects on electron distribution were also seen for the Y169F TMADH. To simplify the analysis of the absorbance change associated with flavin reduction in Y169F TMADH, the experiment was performed at pH 6.5, thereby effectively eliminating the two slower phases associated with intramolecular electron transfer observed at higher pH values. Upon completion of the faster phase of flavin reduction the spectrum resembles that of a mixture of oxidized enzyme and enzyme in the dihydroflavin form (Fig. 3). Following completion of the slower phase, the spectrum is that of the dihydroflavin form. The spectral form seen at the end of the faster phase rules out a sequential two-step reduction process involving a flavin semiquinone intermediate since this would give rise to a characteristic flavin semiquinone spectrum. 2The transient formation of an anionic semiquinone would normally be observed readily at 365 nm. However, single wavelength studies performed at 365 nm indicated that transient formation of an anionic semiquinone did not occur en routeto formation of the dihydroflavin. At 1000 s after initial mixing of enzyme with substrate, the observed spectrum indicates that electron transfer to the 4Fe/4S center is indeed far from complete (data not shown). To further confirm that internal electron transfer to the 4Fe/4S center is not implicated in the biphasic behavior seen here, the 4Fe/4S center in the enzyme was selectively inactivated by ferricenium-PF6 (see “Experimental Procedures”), which is known to render the 4Fe/4S center redox inert. The reductive half-reaction of the modified enzyme was studied at pH 6.5, 7.0, and 10.0. Again, the reaction is biphasic at pH 6.5 and 7.0 and monophasic at pH 10.0, as seen in the untreated Y169F TMADH, while ferricenium-PF6 inactivated wild-type enzyme exhibits monophasic behavior at all pH values examined (data not shown). The substrate concentration dependence of flavin reduction with Y169F TMADH has been investigated at pH 7.0 (using 20 mm phosphate buffer so that the biphasic behavior could be resolved throughout the entire substrate concentration range) and pH 6.5 (using 100 mmbuffer). 3Given that trimethylamine is predominantly protonated at the pH values employed here and the wide substrate concentration range used in the experiments (0 to 120 mm), control experiments have been performed in the absence and presence of 0.2 m potassium chloride to study the effect of ionic strength on kinetics. Additionally, in separate experiments and at selected pH values (6.5, 7.0, and 7.5), ionic strength was kept constant by balancing the substrate and potassium chloride concentrations over the entire substrate concentration range studied. In all cases, the values for the limiting rate constants for both phases and enzyme-substrate dissociation constants were found to be identical (within experimental error). The data therefore demonstrate that ionic strength influences only the relative spectral change associated with each of the two kinetic phases (presumably by perturbing the apparent pK a of about 6.2) and does not affect the observed rate constants for each phase or the corresponding dissociation constant for the E·S complex. At pH 7.0, both phases for flavin reduction in Y169F TMADH exhibit hyperbolic dependence on [TMA]. The limiting rate constant for the faster phase (43 s−1 ± 1.7) was about 21-fold less than that seen with wild-type enzyme (903 s−1 ± 50) (TableI). The dissociation constants calculated for the two phases seen with the mutant protein are 35 ± 3.4 and 38 ± 4 mm, respectively, considerably larger than that seen with wild-type TMADH (6 mm, Table I). At pH 7.0, both phases were found to be sensitive to a kinetic isotope effect of approximately 7, as seen with wild-type TMADH, when perdeuterated TMA was used (Table I) indicating that the observed kinetics involve C-H bond breakage. At pH 6.5, the faster phase of the reaction exhibits hyperbolic dependence on [TMA], with k lim and K d of 9 ± 0.8 s−1 and 55 ± 10 mm, respectively. The slower phase, however, is essentially independent of [TMA] over the concentration range studied (except in the very low substrate concentration regime), with an observed rate constant of 0.03 s−1. There is also an associated loss of primary kinetic isotope effect on the reaction (Table I), indicating that cleavage of the C-H bond is no longer rate-limiting. Given the additional observation that the slow phase of the reaction seen at pH 7.0 is significantly slower thank cat, we have not pursued the nature of this slow phase further in the present work.Table ILimiting rate and equilibrium constants for wild-type and Y169F TMADH reductive half-reactions at 25 °C, pH 7.0, and pH 6.5Wild-typeY169F (fast phase)Y169F (slow phase)klimKdklimKdklimKds−1mms−1mms−1mmpH 7TMA903 ± 506.6 ± 0.543.0 ± 1.734.7 ± 3.45.4 ± 0.2638.0 ± 4.3Perdeuterated TMA185 ± 2112.4 ± 1.85.7 ± 0.1749.4 ± 3.30.74 ± 0.04843.3 ± 7.4TMA and ferricenium596 ± 585.4 ± 0.846.9 ± 2.830.6 ± 5.111.3 ± 0.840.4 ± 6.9Inactivated enzymepH 6.5TMA679 ± 4426.9 ± 2.59.0 ± 0.855.5 ± 9.90.029aRates were independent of substrate concentration.

Open table in a new tab For Y169F TMADH at pH 7.0, buffer conditions were 20 mmpotassium phosphate to enable expression of the biphasic nature of the 443 nm transients throughout the entire range of substrate concentration. All other data are for enzyme contained in 100 mm potassium phosphate at the respective pH value. The reaction of Y169F TMADH with trimethylamine has been investigated as a function of pH at 5 °C. The pH dependence of k lim seen with Y169F enzyme reveals two reasonably well resolved pK a values (pK a 6.7 ± 0.2 and 9.5 ± 0.3; Fig. 4A), whereas only one ionization is observed for the wild-type enzyme (18Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A plot of k lim/K d versus pH gives a bell-shaped curve (Fig. 4B), as seen in wild-type enzyme (18Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), with two pK a values of 9.7 ± 0.1 and 11.0 ± 0.1 attributable to the ionization of free enzyme and free substrate (pK a of TMA is 9.81), respectively. As in the case of wild-type enzyme, substrate is found to bind preferentially in the cationic form (14Basran J. Mewies M. Mathews F.S. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Comparison of the pH profiles for Y169F and wild-type enzymes indicates that the pK a values that control flavin reduction are slightly perturbed on mutating Tyr-169 to Phe. However, all kinetically influential ionizations seen in the wild-type enzyme remain in the Y169F mutant enzyme, indicating that Tyr-169 in the wild-type enzyme either does not ionize over the pH range investigated, or that its ionization is not kinetically influential for flavin reduction. The UV/visible absorption spectra for the oxidized and substrate-reduced forms of wild-type and Y169F TMADH, along with the corresponding [oxidized] minus [substrate-reduced] difference spectra are shown in Fig. 5. Oxidized wild-type protein exhibits anA 444 nm/A 382 nmabsorbance ratio of about 1.3, whereas that for the Y169F TMADH gives a ratio around 1.03 due to incomplete flavinylation when expressed inEscherichia coli. Interestingly, the absorption change elicited by reduction with excess substrate for this mutant protein is different from that seen with wild-type protein under the same conditions (which we have previously shown to be identical in native and recombinant wild-type enzyme; Ref.11Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13942-13950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4It is to be emphasized that while the incomplete flavinylation of the recombinant Y169F mutant prevents a direct spectral comparison of its absorbance spectrum with that of the fully flavinylated native protein, a direct comparison can be made between the substrate-induced difference spectra seen with the two forms of the enzyme, as only that portion of the mutant protein possessing flavin can become reduced by substrate. All discussion and conclusions here are based on these substrate-induced difference spectra and not on the absolute spectra themselves. Use of substrate as reductant ensures that the entirety of the spectral change seen with the mutant arises from enzyme that possesses the full complement of redox-active cofactors, as the deflavo form of the enzyme cannot be reduced by substrate. In determining the concentration of the Y169F protein, we use an effective extinction coefficient that gives the concentration of the fully functional, flavin-containing portion of the enzyme, not simply the total concentration of polypeptide. In both Figs. 5 and 6, spectra of native and Y169F enzyme are presented that have been normalized on a per-flavin basis so that a direct comparison can be made in extinction coefficient and EPR intensity. In particular, the difference maximum at 365 nm (reflecting accumulation of the flavin semiquinone form) is absent in the mutant. The observed spectral change seen with the Y169F mutant is in fact quite reminiscent of that generated by reduction of wild-type protein to the two-electron reduced level using sodium dithionite at pH 8.0, where the enzyme principally contains flavin semiquinone and reduced 4Fe/4S center but their magnetic moments do not interact (22Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interpretation is further supported by the EPR spectroscopic studies discussed below. The implication is that the distribution of reducing equivalents between the 4Fe/4S and flavin centers in the two proteins are different; a larger portion of Y169F TMADH exists as flavin hydroquinone and oxidized 4Fe/4S center rather than flavin semiquinone and reduced 4Fe/4S center, especially at pH 7.0. Full reduction of wild-type TMADH, which requires 3 reducing equivalents, is observed when titrated with sodium dithionite, however, the enzyme takes up only two electrons when reduced with excess substrate or reduced by sodium dithionite in the presence of TMAC (a substrate analog and inhibitor of TMADH) (19Steenkamp D.J. Singer T.P. Beinert H. Biochem. J. 1978; 169: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Steenkamp D.J. Beinert H. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar): binding of the substrate analog perturbs the reduction potential of the flavin semiquinone/hydroquinone couple such that full reduction of the enzyme does not occur. When Y169F TMADH is reduced with sodium dithionite in the presence of TMAC at pH 7.0, however, the final difference absorption spectrum resembles that for three-electron reduction of wild-type enzyme (data not shown). This indicates that full reduction has occurred, consistent with the EPR studies described below. The results indicate that the oxidation-reduction properties of the mutant protein are perturbed and that the ability of the Y169F mutant to form the spin-interacting state is compromised. EPR spectra of wild-type and Y169F TMADH reacted with excess substrate are shown in Fig. 6, A-D. Under these conditions, the wild-type protein contains flavin semiquinone and a reduced iron-sulfur center whose magnetic moments interact strongly with each other and give rise to a spin-interaction state with characteristic g ∼ 2 complex high-field EPR signal and an intense g ∼ 4 half-field signal (Fig. 6, A and B). For the mutant protein, on the other hand, the signal centered at g ∼ 2 is primarily a combination of the axial signal of flavin semiquinone and the rhombic signal of reduced 4Fe/4S center (Fig. 6D). The complex EPR signal associated with the spin-interacting state seen in the wild-type protein is not observed. In addition, the intensity of the g ∼ 4 signal that is diagnostic of the spin-interacting state is greatly reduced in the mutant compared with wild-type protein (Fig. 6C). (The g ∼ 4.3 signal seen in the spectrum is due to trace amounts of adventitious iron in the sample.) The experiments have also been performed at pH 10.0 and similar results are observed (data not shown). This indicates that the mutant protein contains a substantial amount of flavin semiquinone and reduced iron-sulfur center under the present experimental conditions, but the magnetic moments of the two unpaired spins (which given the manner in which the samples were prepared must exist in the same enzyme molecule) do not interact with each other strongly as in the wild-type protein. Fig. 6, E and F, shows the EPR spectra observed when the mutant protein is reduced by sodium dithionite in the presence of TMAC. The rhombic EPR signal of the reduced 4Fe/4S center is observed at high-field (Fig. 6F) and no half-field signal associated with the spin-interaction state is seen (Fig. 6E), which is consistent with the UV/visible results that the mutant protein is fully reduced to a three-electron reduction level by sodium dithionite even in the presence of TMAC. Tyr-169 is one of three amino acids comprising a novel Tyr-His-Asp triad in the active site of TMADH. Our data for the Y169F mutant clearly indicate that C-H bond cleavage and FMN reduction occur in the mutant enzyme, albeit at a limiting rate that is approximately 100-fold slower than is seen with wild-type enzyme. Tyr-169 is in van der Waals contact with the flavin isoalloxazine ring, and local adjustments in active site structure (both physical and electronic) as a result of the mutation are likely to be responsible, at least in part, for the slower rates observed in the flavin reduction of Y169F TMADH. The pH-dependence profiles for Y169F are similar to those for wild-type enzyme, indicating that Tyr-169 is not the group whose ionization facilitates substrate oxidation and/or substrate binding in wild-type enzyme. However, oxidation of substrate is controlled by an additional ionization with pK a of 6.2 in Y169F TMADH, not observed in the wild-type enzyme. At pH values below this pK a, enzyme reduction occurs as two kinetically resolvable steps, only the faster of which appears to be catalytically significant. The identity of the amino acid residue responsible for the additional ionization (pK a value 6.2) that controls the expression of the biphasic reductive transients in Y169F at low pH remains to be determined, however, it cannot be His-172 (which H-bonds to Tyr-169 in wild-type enzyme), since recent studies of a mutant H172Q TMADH suggest that ionization of this residue occurs around pH 8. 5J. Basran, M. J. Sutcliffe, R. Hille, and N. S. Scrutton, unpublished data. Similarly, this work indicates that none of these residues is likely to be involved in abstraction of a proton from substrate to form a carbanion intermediate (18Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Indeed the base catalysis accounts for only a quite modest portion of the enzyme-catalyzed rate acceleration for substrate oxidation (17Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30869-30879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The lack of an obvious base to support a carbanion mechanism provides indirect support for homolytic C-H bond cleavage analogous to the mechanism that has been proposed for the mechanism of monoamine oxidase (as discussed in Ref. 18Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The present work clearly demonstrates that Tyr-169 also plays an important role in mediating the spin-interaction between the flavin semiquinone and reduced 4Fe/4S center in TMADH. Previous work has shown that formation of the spin-interacting state of TMADH is governed by a basic residue located at or near the active site, with pK a value around 9.5 (22Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and our results implicate Tyr-169 as this basic residue. Although Tyr-169 lies opposite the flavin ring from the iron-sulfur in TMADH, the importance of this residue in forming the spin-interaction between the two centers can be rationalized in the context of the x-ray crystal structure of TMADH (6Lim L.W. Shamala N. Mathews F.S. Steenkamp D.J. Hamlin R. Xuong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15140-15146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyr-169 is located near the C(2) = O group of the flavin isoalloxazine ring and its van der Waal's surface is in contact with that of the flavin ring. When a negative charge is developed on the hydroxyl group of Tyr-169 side chain, due to electrostatic repulsion the unpaired electron density on the flavin isoalloxazine ring is reasonably expected to be forced to redistribute away from this residue toward the 4Fe/4S center, effectively reducing the spin-spin distance. This may also induce a larger dipole moment on the flavin isoalloxazine ring, which could be important in promoting the formation of the spin-interacting state. The present work also indicates that the reduction potential of the semiquinone/hydroquinone flavin couple is perturbed in the Y169F enzyme, as reflected in the shift in oxidation-reduction equilibrium inferred from the UV/visible spectra. This is supported by the steady-state kinetic study demonstrating that substrate inhibition is absent in the Y169F TMADH, and the spectroscopic studies showing that full reduction of Y169F is achieved with dithionite even in the presence of TMAC. As described in Ref. 18Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, substrate inhibition in wild-type TMADH is accounted for by perturbation of the semiquinone/hydroquinone flavin couple upon substrate binding to partially reduced enzyme. Potentiometric studies on Y169F will soon help to further illustrate this point. We thank Dr. M. Mewies for assistance with mutagenesis in the early stages of this work and Craig Hemman for valuable help in the EPR experiments."

The addition of XPD·CAK to the core TFIIH potently stimulates the TFIIH transcriptional activity (18Drapkin R. Le Roy G. Cho H. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These observations suggest that core TFIIH and XPD·CAK interact to form a complex that constitutes the TFIIH holoenzyme (holo-TFIIH).

In addition, a number of studies have suggested that the trimeric CAK complex is the CDK7-containing complex involved in cell cycle control (21Fisher R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 23Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These studies were based on initial reports that identified the trimeric CAK complex as the kinase responsible for activating a number of cdks (1Fesquet D. Labbe J.-C. Derancourt J. Capony J.-P.

However, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kin28 and Ccl1, the counterparts of CDK7 and cyclin H, associate with S. cerevisiae TFIIH, although they do not exhibit detectable CAK activity (4Feaver W.J.

However, a recent report indicates that CDK7 is essential for mitosis and cdk-activating kinase activity in Drosophila melanogaster (27Larochelle S. Pandur J. Fisher R.P. Salz H.K. Suter B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Here we show that the trimeric CAK complex exhibits an inhibitory activity in RNAPII-dependent transcription. This inhibition results from the preclusion of TFIIF and RNAPII from the preinitiation complex. These studies reveal a novel role for the trimeric CAK in regulation of transcription. Trimeric CAK was purified from 3 g of HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 1A). Nuclear extract was loaded on a 1-liter column of phosphocellulose (Whatman) and fractionated stepwise by the indicated KCl concentrations in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptothanol, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The phosphocellulose 0.3 m KCl fraction (400 mg) was dialyzed to 0.1 m KCl in buffer A and loaded on a 100-ml DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted with 0.5 m KCl in buffer A. The 0.5m KCl elution (260 mg) was dialyzed to 100 mmKCl in buffer A and loaded on a 100-ml Q-Sepharose column (Sigma). The column was resolved using a linear 10-column volume gradient of 100–600 mm KCl. Fractions containing CDK7 (∼200 mm KCl, 37 mg) were dialyzed to 10 mm potassium phosphate in buffer B (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and loaded on a 20-ml hydroxyapatite column (American International Chemical). The column was resolved using a linear 10-column volume gradient of 10–600 mm potassium phosphate in buffer B. CDK7-containing fractions (100 mmpotassium phosphate, 8.6 mg) were dialyzed to 1 m ammonium sulfate in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 4 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) and fractionated on a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The phenyl-Superose column was resolved using a linear 10-column volume gradient of 1 m to 0 mm ammonium sulfate in buffer A. CDK7-containing fractions (∼0.4 m ammonium sulfate, 0.5 mg) were precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate and fractionated on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 1 m KCl in buffer A. We generated and purified CAK using a detailed protocol for the production of CAK in insect SF9 cells as described previously (21Fisher R.P.

CTD kinase assays for phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNAPII were described previously (7Shiekhattar R. Mermelstein F. Fisher R.P. Drapkin R. Dynlacht B. Wessling H.C. Morgan D.O.

The trimeric CAK complex from HeLa nuclear extract was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A) using the CTD-kinase activity and Western blot analysis with antibodies against CDK7 and cyclin H. Nuclear extract was initially fractionated by phosphocellulose chromatography. The 0.3 m KCl step elution contained approximately 40% of CDK7 immunoreactivity and was devoid of TFIIH activity or ERCC3 immunoreactivity, which fractionated into the 0.5 m KCl step elution (data not shown). The 0.3m KCl fraction was therefore further purified through five additional steps (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the CTD kinase activity of CAK on the sizing column (Superose 6) revealed the peak of activity eluting at ∼200 kDa, consistent with the previously reported size for the trimeric CAK complex (21Fisher R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We estimate that our purification resulted in ∼2000-fold enrichment in CAK. Analysis of column fractions in a transcription system reconstituted with recombinant TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, highly purified HeLa or rat holo-TFIIH, and highly purified HeLa core RNAPII revealed an inhibitory activity copurifing with the CDK7 complex throughout the purification (Fig. 1B). The transcriptional inhibitory activity was also observed in the last two steps of the purification (phenyl-Superose and Superose 6) (Fig. 1, C and D). Highest concentrations of the CAK complex tested resulted in about 95% inhibition in basal transcription. To determine if the inhibitory activity associated with the HeLa fractions is the CAK complex, we expressed either the trimeric (CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1) or the dimeric CAK complex (CDK7-cyclin H) in insect SF9 cells. These complexes were purified as previously reported (21Fisher R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Moreover, as the highly purified holo-TFIIH complex also contains CAK, we sought to determine the action of the trimeric CAK complex in an assay free of TFIIH. Similar to a previous report (31Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), reconstituted transcription using the rat supercoiled somatostatin promoter is independent of TFIIH or TFIIE but is highly stimulated by these factors (Fig. 2B). Analysis of recombinant trimeric CAK complex in reconstituted transcription assay either in the presence (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2) or the absence (lanes 3–5) of TFIIH revealed that this complex is a potent inhibitor of transcription. The inhibitory effect of CAK is achieved at roughly a 1:1 stoichiometry (0.25 pmol) with other basal factors. To further ascertain the role of the p36/MAT1 subunit of the CDK7 complex in transcriptional repression, we compared the recombinant dimeric and trimeric CAK complexes. Although the two CAK complexes displayed similar kinase activity as ascertained by phosphorylation of a CTD peptide (Fig. 3A), analysis of the dimeric CAK in transcription revealed that p36/MAT1 is required for the inhibitory activity of the CAK complex (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the trimeric CAK, which inhibited transcription driven from either the supercoiled somatostatin (lanes 2 and 3) or supercoiled HTLV-1 (lanes 8 and 9) promoters, the dimeric CAK was devoid of any inhibitory activity with either promoter (lanes 4–6 or 10and 11). These data indicate that the p36/MAT1 subunit of the CAK complex is required for inhibition of transcription and that the CAK-mediated inhibition is independent of the promoter used. To determine whether the p36/MAT1 subunit of the CAK complex is sufficient for transcriptional repression, the p36/MAT1 subunit was expressed inEscherichia coli, and the purified p36/MAT1 was analyzed for its activity in transcription. In contrast to trimeric CAK (Fig. 3B, lane 2), the addition of p36/MAT1 not only failed to inhibit transcription (lanes 3–5) but also displayed a small stimulatory activity (compare lanes 1 and 3). These results demonstrate that although p36/MAT1 is required for the inhibitory activity of the CAK complex, it is not sufficient for inhibition. The p36/MAT1 subunit of CAK was produced in SF9 cells, and purified protein was tested for its ability to confer repression when added to the dimeric CAK complex. As Fig. 3C indicates, neither the dimeric CAK (lane 2) nor the p36/MAT1 protein alone were sufficient to mediate repression. However, the addition of the p36/MAT1 subunit to dimeric CAK reconstitutes the transcriptional repression observed with trimeric CAK (lane 4). To analyze which step during the formation of the preinitiation complex the trimeric CAK may target to repress transcription, we incubated the basal transcription factors in a stepwise fashion with the DNA for 30 min before adding the trimeric CAK complex (Fig. 4A). Preincubation of DNA with either TBP (lane 2) or TBP and TFIIB (lane 3) could not overcome the inhibitory effect of CAK, indicating that the TBP·TFIIB complex (TB) formation is not the target of the CAK complex. However, the addition of TFIIF to the preinitiation complex, which results in the formation of the TBF complex, could partially relieve the CAK repression (lane 4). Formation of the TBPolF or TBPolFE complex by further preincubation with RNAPII or RNAPII and TFIIE resulted in a complete recovery of transcription (lanes 5 and 6). These results indicate that trimeric CAK precludes the entry of RNAPII and TFIIF into a competent preinitiation complex, and a preformed preinitiation complex is refractory to the action of trimeric CAK. This contention is further substantiated when we analyzed whether the addition of excess TFIIF or RNAPII can overcome the inhibitory activity of the trimeric CAK complex. As shown in Fig. 4B, the addition of increasing amounts of TFIIF partially overcomes the CAK-mediated repression (lanes 3 and 4), whereas the addition of excess RNAPII could completely restore transcription (lane 5). We conclude that trimeric CAKs repress transcription by precluding RNAPII and TFIIF entry into the preinitiation complex. To address whether the kinase activity of CDK7 plays a role in CAK-mediated inhibition, we analyzed a kinase-deficient mutant of CDK7, in which lysine 41 was replaced by alanine (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The purified dimeric CAK/K41A, produced in insect cells, was mixed with the p36/MAT1 subunit, produced in insect cells, and analyzed in a reconstituted transcription system. As Fig. 4C indicates, the addition of kinase-deficient CAK resulted in a potent inhibition of transcription (compare lane 1 to lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that CAK-mediated inhibition is not because of the kinase activity of CAK and may result from CAK physically destabilizing the preinitiation complex. Because TFIIH displays a stimulatory activity in transcription by stabilizing the preinitiation complex, we analyzed whether increasing concentrations of TFIIH can relieve the CAK-mediated repression. As Fig. 4D reveals, the addition of excess TFIIH can overcome the inhibitory activity of CAK (compare lanes 2–4 to 6–8). These results indicate that TFIIH and CAK are in a competition for the preinitiation complex. Whereas TFIIH stimulates transcription by stabilizing the preinitiation complex formation, CAK exerts an inhibitory effect by disrupting its formation. The novelty of this work lies in the following. First, it demonstrates transcriptional inhibitory activity for trimeric CAK in a fully defined system, comprised of essentially homogeneous basal factors and RNA polymerase II. Second, it shows that CAK inhibits transcription by preventing RNA polymerase II and TFIIF entry into the preinitiation complex. Third, it presents evidence for the requirement of p36/MAT1 in the CAK-mediated inhibitory effect. Finally, it demonstrates that the inhibitory activity is independent of the kinase activity of CDK7. The trimeric CAK complex was initially identified as the kinase complex responsible for phosphorylation and consequent activation of other cyclin-dependent kinases from mammalian cells (1Fesquet D. Labbe J.-C. Derancourt J. Capony J.-P. Galas S. Girard F. Lorca T. Shuttleworth J. Doree M. Cavadore J.-C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3111-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 2Poon R.Y.C.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It was later discovered that CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1 were also components of the basal transcription factor TFIIH (4Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D.

Nature. 1995; 374: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was observed that TFIIH can be dissociated into two subcomplexes, one containing the core TFIIH subunits (XPB, p62, p51, p44, and p34) and the other containing XPD and the three CAK subunits (18Drapkin R.

Pan Z.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We found that the trimeric CAK purified from HeLa cells contained a transcriptional inhibitory activity in a highly purified reconstituted transcription system. The inhibitory activity associated with the HeLa fractions was demonstrated to be mediated by the trimeric CAK complex, because the recombinant trimeric CAK produced in insect cells inhibited transcription. Interestingly, the p36/MAT1 subunit of the trimeric CAK was required for the transcriptional inhibition. This observation lends further support to the physiological relevance of CAK-mediated inhibition, as the predominant form of CAK in mammalian extracts not associated with TFIIH contains the p36/MAT1 subunit (19Reardon J.T.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The transcriptional inhibition by the CAK complex did not result from CDK7 kinase activity, because the kinase-deficient mutant of CAK is also a potent inhibitor of transcription. Our studies revealed that CAK inhibited transcription by preventing the formation of the TBPolF complex. Therefore, either preforming the TBPolF complex or the addition of excess TFIIF, RNAPII, or TFIIH was able to stabilize the complex and to overcome the inhibitory effect of CAK. A number of studies have concluded that the trimeric CAK complex represents the form of CAK involved in cell cycle control (1Fesquet D. Labbe J.-C. Derancourt J. Capony J.-P. Galas S. Girard F.

Here we present evidence indicating that the trimeric CAK complex displays a novel role in transcription distinct from that of its function when associated with TFIIH.

https://openalex.org/W2087511979,"A purified recombinant human rhinovirus-14 3C protease preparation contained only approximately 50% active enzyme as titrated using specifically designed irreversible 3C protease inhibitors. Analysis of the purified 3C protein by isoelectric focusing showed differently charged 3C isoforms that had isoelectric points (pI) of 8.3 (55%) and 9.0 (45%), with the latter one being consistent with the predicted pI of the human rhinovirus-14 3C protein. Further analysis indicated that the pI 8.3 protein was the deamidated form of 3C, and it displayed approximately 10-fold reduced cleavage activity relative to the original 3C protease sample. Peptide mapping followed by sequence analysis revealed that a single asparagine, Asn-164, was deamidated to aspartic acid in the pI 8.3 isoform. Converting Asn-164 to Asp by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a mutated 3C protease with extremely low activity, as seen with the pI 8.3 isoform, indicating a role of Asn-164 in substrate recognition and binding. In addition, the deamidated 3C protease was found to be present in vivo, and its abundance was related to the viral replication cycle. Moreover, mutant virus carrying Asp-164 showed reduced viability in infected cells. Taken together, our data suggest that 3C protein deamidation plays a role in the regulation of its enzymatic activity."
