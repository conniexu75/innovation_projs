https://openalex.org/W1975740938,"The adenosine class of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediates the important role of extracellular adenosine in many physiological processes and is antagonized by caffeine. We have determined the crystal structure of the human A 2A adenosine receptor, in complex with a high-affinity subtype-selective antagonist, ZM241385, to 2.6 angstrom resolution. Four disulfide bridges in the extracellular domain, combined with a subtle repacking of the transmembrane helices relative to the adrenergic and rhodopsin receptor structures, define a pocket distinct from that of other structurally determined GPCRs. The arrangement allows for the binding of the antagonist in an extended conformation, perpendicular to the membrane plane. The binding site highlights an integral role for the extracellular loops, together with the helical core, in ligand recognition by this class of GPCRs and suggests a role for ZM241385 in restricting the movement of a tryptophan residue important in the activation mechanism of the class A receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1998138507,"Sea levels have been determined for most of the Paleozoic Era (542 to 251 million years ago), but an integrated history of sea levels has remained unrealized. We reconstructed a history of sea-level fluctuations for the entire Paleozoic by using stratigraphic sections from pericratonic and cratonic basins. Evaluation of the timing and amplitude of individual sea-level events reveals that the magnitude of change is the most problematic to estimate accurately. The long-term sea level shows a gradual rise through the Cambrian, reaching a zenith in the Late Ordovician, then a short-lived but prominent withdrawal in response to Hirnantian glaciation. Subsequent but decreasingly substantial eustatic highs occurred in the mid-Silurian, near the Middle/Late Devonian boundary, and in the latest Carboniferous. Eustatic lows are recorded in the early Devonian, near the Mississippian/Pennsylvanian boundary, and in the Late Permian. One hundred and seventy-two eustatic events are documented for the Paleozoic, varying in magnitude from a few tens of meters to ∼125 meters."
https://openalex.org/W1998135879,"Butenes and butadiene, which are useful intermediates for the synthesis of polymers and other compounds, are synthesized traditionally by oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n -butane over complex metal oxides. Such catalysts require high O 2 /butane ratios to maintain the activity, which leads to unwanted product oxidation. We show that carbon nanotubes with modified surface functionality efficiently catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of n -butane to butenes, especially butadiene. For low O 2 /butane ratios, a high selectivity to alkenes was achieved for periods as long as 100 hours. This process is mildly catalyzed by ketonic C O groups and occurs via a combination of parallel and sequential oxidation steps. A small amount of phosphorus greatly improved the selectivity by suppressing the combustion of hydrocarbons."
https://openalex.org/W2070910039,"We present six experiments that tested whether lacking control increases illusory pattern perception, which we define as the identification of a coherent and meaningful interrelationship among a set of random or unrelated stimuli. Participants who lacked control were more likely to perceive a variety of illusory patterns, including seeing images in noise, forming illusory correlations in stock market information, perceiving conspiracies, and developing superstitions. Additionally, we demonstrated that increased pattern perception has a motivational basis by measuring the need for structure directly and showing that the causal link between lack of control and illusory pattern perception is reduced by affirming the self. Although these many disparate forms of pattern perception are typically discussed as separate phenomena, the current results suggest that there is a common motive underlying them."
https://openalex.org/W2099744080,"Entanglement, a key feature of quantum mechanics, is a resource that allows the improvement of precision measurements beyond the conventional bound attainable by classical means. This results in the standard quantum limit, which is reached in today's best available sensors of various quantities such as time and position. Many of these sensors are interferometers in which the standard quantum limit can be overcome by using quantum-entangled states (in particular spin squeezed states) at the two input ports. Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms are considered good candidates to provide such states involving a large number of particles. Here we demonstrate spin squeezed states suitable for atomic interferometry by splitting a condensate into a few parts using a lattice potential. Site-resolved detection of the atoms allows the measurement of the atom number difference and relative phase, which are conjugate variables. The observed fluctuations imply entanglement between the particles, a resource that would allow a precision gain of 3.8 dB over the standard quantum limit for interferometric measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2028444170,"In bilaterian animals, such as humans, flies and worms, hundreds of microRNAs (miRNAs), some conserved throughout bilaterian evolution, collectively regulate a substantial fraction of the transcriptome. In addition to miRNAs, other bilaterian small RNAs, known as Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), protect the genome from transposons. Here we identify small RNAs from animal phyla that diverged before the emergence of the Bilateria. The cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (starlet sea anemone), a close relative to the Bilateria, possesses an extensive repertoire of miRNA genes, two classes of piRNAs and a complement of proteins specific to small-RNA biology comparable to that of humans. The poriferan Amphimedon queenslandica (sponge), one of the simplest animals and a distant relative of the Bilateria, also possesses miRNAs, both classes of piRNAs and a full complement of the small-RNA machinery. Animal miRNA evolution seems to have been relatively dynamic, with precursor sizes and mature miRNA sequences differing greatly between poriferans, cnidarians and bilaterians. Nonetheless, miRNAs and piRNAs have been available as classes of riboregulators to shape gene expression throughout the evolution and radiation of animal phyla."
https://openalex.org/W2018232865,"Variable rates of molecular evolution have been documented across the tree of life, but the cause of this observed variation within and among clades remains uncertain. In plants, it has been suggested that life history traits are correlated with the rate of molecular evolution, but previous studies have yielded conflicting results. Exceptionally large phylogenies of five major angiosperm clades demonstrate that rates of molecular evolution are consistently low in trees and shrubs, with relatively long generation times, as compared with related herbaceous plants, which generally have shorter generation times. Herbs show much higher rates of molecular change but also much higher variance in rates. Correlates of life history attributes have long been of interest to biologists, and our results demonstrate how changes in the rate of molecular evolution that are linked to life history traits can affect measurements of the tempo of evolution as well as our ability to identify and conserve biodiversity."

https://openalex.org/W2006702818,"Host-microbe symbioses play a critical role in the evolution of biological diversity and complexity. In a notably intricate system, southern pine beetles use symbiotic fungi to help overcome host-tree defenses and to provide nutrition for their larvae. We show that this beetle-fungal mutualism is chemically mediated by a bacterially produced polyunsaturated peroxide. The molecule's selective toxicity toward the beetle's fungal antagonist, combined with the prevalence and localization of its bacterial source, indicates an insect-microbe association that is both mutualistic and coevolved. This unexpected finding in a well-studied system indicates that mutualistic associations between insects and antibiotic-producing bacteria are more common than currently recognized and that identifying their small-molecule mediators can provide a powerful search strategy for therapeutically useful antimicrobial compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2154846778,"Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease characterized by abnormal cellular responses to cigarette smoke, resulting in tissue destruction and airflow limitation. Autophagy is a degradative process involving lysosomal turnover of cellular components, though its role in human diseases remains unclear. Methodology and Principal Findings Increased autophagy was observed in lung tissue from COPD patients, as indicated by electron microscopic analysis, as well as by increased activation of autophagic proteins (microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3B, LC3B, Atg4, Atg5/12, Atg7). Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) is an established model for studying the effects of cigarette smoke exposure in vitro. In human pulmonary epithelial cells, exposure to CSE or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor rapidly induced autophagy. CSE decreased HDAC activity, resulting in increased binding of early growth response-1 (Egr-1) and E2F factors to the autophagy gene LC3B promoter, and increased LC3B expression. Knockdown of E2F-4 or Egr-1 inhibited CSE-induced LC3B expression. Knockdown of Egr-1 also inhibited the expression of Atg4B, a critical factor for LC3B conversion. Inhibition of autophagy by LC3B-knockdown protected epithelial cells from CSE-induced apoptosis. Egr-1−/− mice, which displayed basal airspace enlargement, resisted cigarette-smoke induced autophagy, apoptosis, and emphysema. Conclusions We demonstrate a critical role for Egr-1 in promoting autophagy and apoptosis in response to cigarette smoke exposure in vitro and in vivo. The induction of autophagy at early stages of COPD progression suggests novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cigarette smoke induced lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W2060832017,"As the staple food for 35% of the world's population, wheat is one of the most important crop species. To date, sequence-based tools to accelerate wheat improvement are lacking. As part of the international effort to sequence the 17–billion–base-pair hexaploid bread wheat genome (2 n = 6 x = 42 chromosomes), we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)–based integrated physical map of the largest chromosome, 3B, that alone is 995 megabases. A chromosome-specific BAC library was used to assemble 82% of the chromosome into 1036 contigs that were anchored with 1443 molecular markers, providing a major resource for genetic and genomic studies. This physical map establishes a template for the remaining wheat chromosomes and demonstrates the feasibility of constructing physical maps in large, complex, polyploid genomes with a chromosome-based approach."

https://openalex.org/W2081444617,"The protein modifier ubiquitin is a signal for proteasome-mediated degradation in eukaryotes. Proteasome-bearing prokaryotes have been thought to degrade proteins via a ubiquitin-independent pathway. We have identified a prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein, Pup (Rv2111c), which was specifically conjugated to proteasome substrates in the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Pupylation occurred on lysines and required proteasome accessory factor A (PafA). In a pafA mutant, pupylated proteins were absent and substrates accumulated, thereby connecting pupylation with degradation. Although analogous to ubiquitylation, pupylation appears to proceed by a different chemistry. Thus, like eukaryotes, bacteria may use a small-protein modifier to control protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W2086204811,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important during embryonic cell layer movement and tumor cell invasiveness. EMT converts adherent epithelial cells to motile mesenchymal cells, favoring metastasis in the context of cancer progression. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) triggers EMT via intracellular Smad transducers and other signaling proteins. We previously reported that the high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) gene is required for TGF-β to elicit EMT in mammary epithelial cells. In the present study we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which HMGA2 induces EMT. We found that HMGA2 regulates expression of many important repressors of E-cadherin. Among these, we analyzed in detail the zinc-finger transcription factor SNAIL1, which plays key roles in tumor progression and EMT. We demonstrate that HMGA2 directly binds to the SNAIL1 promoter and acts as a transcriptional regulator of SNAIL1 expression. Furthermore, we observed that HMGA2 cooperates with the TGF-β/Smad pathway in regulating SNAIL1 gene expression. The mechanism behind this cooperation involves physical interaction between these factors, leading to an increased binding of Smads to the SNAIL1 promoter. SNAIL1 seems to play the role of a master effector downstream of HMGA2 for induction of EMT, as SNAIL1 knock-down partially reverts HMGA2-induced loss of epithelial differentiation. The data propose that HMGA2 acts in a gene-specific manner to orchestrate the transcriptional network necessary for the EMT program.

Sleeman J.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar). It converts adherent epithelial cells to motile mesenchymal cells. A key event in the process of EMT is the functional loss of E-cadherin (encoded by CDH1), a key protein maintaining epithelial cell-cell adhesion (2Peinado H. Portillo F. Cano A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression of the CDH1 gene is one of the mechanisms for silencing of E-cadherin. Several transcriptional repressors, such as the zinc finger factors SNAIL1, SNAIL2 (also known as SLUG), ZEB1/δEF1, ZEB2/SIP1, and the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor E47, have been identified as strong repressors of E-cadherin expression and have been implicated in tumor progression (3Peinado H. Olmeda D. Cano A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (2585) Google Scholar). Another bHLH transcription factor, TWIST, has also been implicated with the onset of EMT in mammary epithelial cells and with tumor metastasis (4Yang J. Mani S.A. Donaher J.L. Ramaswamy S. Itzykson R.A. Come C. Savagner P. Gitelman I. Richardson A. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). Integrated to the function of the bHLH transcriptional repressors is the role of Id (inhibitor of differentiation/DNA-binding) proteins, such as Id2 and Id3, which form complexes with bHLH factors, such as E47, and inhibit the process of EMT (5Kondo M. Cubillo E. Tobiume K. Shirakihara T. Fukuda N. Suzuki H. Shimizu K. Takehara K. Cano A. Saitoh M. Miyazono K.

Whether Id proteins act as negative regulators of EMT by interfering with the normal action of some of the more recently identified mediators of EMT, such as E2-2 or TWIST, in addition to E47 remains to be elucidated. epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition basic helix-loop-helix DNA affinity precipitation glutathione S-transferase high mobility group Mad homology short hairpin RNA transforming growth factor β reverse transcription tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate hemagglutinin glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The TGF-β family of cytokines strongly promotes the EMT process not only during embryonic development but also during cancer progression (7Zavadil J. Böttinger E.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). For example, TGF-β1 overexpression in keratinocytes of transgenic mice increases EMT and the development of aggressive spindle carcinoma upon exposure to chemical carcinogens (8Cui W. Fowlis D.J. Bryson S. Duffie E. Ireland H. Balmain A. Akhurst R.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Moreover, TGF-β pathway inhibitors block EMT, carcinoma invasiveness, and metastasis in several mouse models of cancer progression (for review, see Ref. 9Pardali K. Moustakas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 21-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Although TGF-β promotes tumorigenesis of late stage carcinomas via induction of EMT, suppression of anti-tumor immune responses, and stimulation of angiogenesis, the same factor acts as a tumor suppressor in normal epithelia and even in early stage adenomas through its ability to inhibit cell growth (9Pardali K. Moustakas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 21-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). TGF-β signals via two distinct receptor serine/threonine kinases, the type I and type II receptors (10Massagué J. Gomis R.R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, the type II receptor transphosphorylates the type I receptor, leading to phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which are known to constantly shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Activated Smad2/3 then form complexes with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus, where they regulate gene expression in collaboration with specific transcription factors and coactivator/corepressor complexes (10Massagué J. Gomis R.R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 11Ross S. Hill C.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 40: 383-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The TGF-β receptors also activate alternative molecular pathways that provide further signaling specificity, as they operate in parallel or in direct coordination with the Smads (12Moustakas A. Heldin C.-H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3573-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways downstream of TGF-β receptors that elicit EMT have recently been elucidated (13Moustakas A. Heldin C.-H. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar); in vitro studies and analyses of tumor growth in mouse models have established that Smads together with additional signaling proteins mediate the EMT response (7Zavadil J. Böttinger E.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 13Moustakas A. Heldin C.-H. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). We have previously described the high mobility group (HMG) protein A2 as a critical factor required for TGF-β-induced EMT in mouse mammary epithelial cells (14Thuault S. Valcourt U. Petersen M. Manfioletti G. Heldin C.-H. Moustakas A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Members of the HMGA family are non-histone chromatin binding factors containing three AT-hooks that enable these proteins to bind to A/T-rich sequences in the minor groove of DNA (15Fusco A. Fedele M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). HMGA proteins are involved in many fundamental cellular processes, such as regulation of gene expression, cell cycle, cellular senescence, differentiation, and viral integration (15Fusco A. Fedele M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). HMGA proteins are highly expressed during embryogenesis but poorly expressed in adult tissues. However, HMGA proteins are overexpressed or fused to other factors in various types of tumors primarily, but not exclusively, of mesenchymal origin. In our previous work we demonstrated that ectopically expressed HMGA2 induces a mesenchymal phenotype characterized by a strong down-regulation of E-cadherin (14Thuault S. Valcourt U. Petersen M. Manfioletti G. Heldin C.-H. Moustakas A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which HMGA2 induces EMT. In the present study we demonstrate that HMGA2 regulates the expression of specific repressors of E-cadherin. We focused on SNAIL1 and demonstrated that HMGA2 cooperates with the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway during regulation of SNAIL1 gene expression. The mechanism behind this cooperation involves the physical interaction between HMGA2 and the Smads, leading to increased binding of Smad proteins on the SNAIL1 promoter. We also found that SNAIL1 acts as a major effector downstream of HMGA2 for induction of EMT, as SNAIL1 knock-down partially reverses the effect of HMGA2 on mesenchymal differentiation.

The full-length (-900) and deletion constructs of the mouse Snail1 promoter fused to luciferase have been previously described (19Peinado H. Quintanilla M. Cano A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21113-21123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The triple point mutant m1 (TAA to CGG, see Fig. 3A) mouse Snail1 promoter fused to luciferase was constructed using the -625 promoter as backbone and PCR-based site-specific mutagenesis. The reporter plasmid pCMV-β-Gal was transfected in each condition and used as a reference. The enhanced luciferase assay kit from BD Biosciences Pharmingen was used. Normalized promoter activity data are plotted in bar graphs representing average values from triplicate determinations with S.D. Each independent experiment was repeated at least twice. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described (14Thuault S. Valcourt U. Petersen M. Manfioletti G. Heldin C.-H. Moustakas A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, the equivalent of 107 cells was used per chromatin immunoprecipitation reaction. Cells were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde. Cells were lysed, and their DNA was sheared by sonication. After preclearing, the sonicated cell extracts were incubated with 5 μg of rabbit anti-Smad4 antibody (H-552; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or preimmune rabbit antiserum as a negative control. Protein-DNA complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed and then eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. After purification, immunoprecipitated and input DNA were analyzed by PCR using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The primers used were 5′-TCGAATCCTCTGTTTATTCTGTCTGT-3′ and 5′-GGAGCCAGAAAGTGCGATGA-3′ for the Snail1 promoter and 5′-TAATGCGCTTGCCTGAGCTA-3′ and 5′-GCTGTCAAATCGGGCATCA-3′ for the Hmga2 distal promoter. DNAP Experiments—HepG2 or COS1 cells transiently transfected with the indicated constructs were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm EDTA, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After preclearing, protein extracts were incubated overnight with biotin-labeled probes described in Fig. 3 and in Table 2. The biotin-labeled probe Snail1 promoter -230/-92 was obtained by PCR amplification using the forward -230/-178 and the reverse -92/-131 probes described above. The biotin-labeled 4× CAGA DNA probe was synthesized in vitro. Streptavidin beads were then added for 1 h followed by 3 washes with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS loading buffer. Bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE.TABLE 2Snail1 promoter oligonucleotide probes used for DNAP experimentsSnail1 promoterPrimer sequenceStrand–131/–92wt5′–CCCAGCCCTGGTACTTAAAGGAATTTGCTGCTGCTAGGGG–3′+5′–CCCCTAGCAGCAGCAAATTCCTTTAAGTACCAGGGCTGGG–3′–m15′–CCCAGCCCTGGTACTCGGAGGAATTTGCTGCTGCTAGGGG–3′+5′–CCCCTAGCAGCAGCAAATTCCTCCGAGTACCAGGGCTGGG–3′–m25′–CCCAGCCCTGGTACTCGGAGGAGCCTGCTGCTGCTAGGGG–3′+5′–CCCCTAGCAGCAGCAGGCTCCTCCGAGTACCAGGGCTGGG–3′––177/–132wt5′–TGGTTCAGCCTTGACAAAGGGGCGTGACCAACAGTACGGTCACGCC–3′+5′–GGCGTGACCGTACTGTTGGTCACGCCCCTTTGTCAAGGCTGAACCA–3′–230/–178wt5′–GCCCAGGCGCACCTGCTCCGGTCTCAGTCTCCGGCCGCGCCGCCGCCAGCCAT–3′+5′–ATGGCTGGCGGCGGCGCGGCCGGAGACTGAGACCGGAGCAGGTGCGCCTGGGC–3′m35′–GCCCAGGCGCACCTGCTCCGATATCAATATCCGGC–3′+5′–GCCGGATATTGATATCGGAGCAGGTGCGCCTGGGC–3′–m45′–CTCCGATATCAATATCCGGCCGCGCCGCCGCCAGCCAT–3′+5′–ATGGCTGGCGGCGGCGCGGCCGGATATTGATATCGGAG–3′––230/–92wtSequence identical to the combination of probes –230/–178, –177/–132, and –131/–924× CAGA promoter5′–CAGACAGTCAGACAGTCAGACAGTCAGACAGT–3′+5′–ACTGTCTGACTGTCTGACTGTCTGACTGTCTG–3′– Open table in a new tab GST Pulldown—The recombinant proteins were transformed into BL21 bacteria and purified on glutathione beads using standard techniques (GE Healthcare). The GST fusion proteins (10 μg) were mixed with FLAG-tagged protein expressing cell lysates from transfected 293T cells in lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) at 4 °C for 16 h. The GST beads were washed 4 times in a salt buffer (0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100) and once in phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting. Input of the GST fusion proteins was visualized by Ponceau Red staining. GST pulldown assays were also done with in vitro transcribed-translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins encoded by pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad3 and pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad4 using the TNT quick coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega Biotech AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Input (2%) and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the products were visualized by phosphorimaging using a FUJIFILM FLA-3000 unit and its associated software. HMGA2 Regulates Expression of a Specific Set of Repressors of the E-cadherin Gene—We previously reported that ectopic expression of HMGA2 in mouse mammary epithelial NMuMG cells induces a mesenchymal phenotype characterized by a strong down-regulation of E-cadherin expression (14Thuault S. Valcourt U. Petersen M. Manfioletti G. Heldin C.-H. Moustakas A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The observed E-cadherin down-regulation prompted us to analyze whether HMGA2 regulates key transcriptional repressors of the E-cadherin gene. We previously reported that two members of the mouse Snail family of zinc-finger transcription factors, Snail1, and Snail2 (also known as Slug) were induced in mammary epithelial cells stimulated by TGF-β1 or in the same cells after overexpression of HMGA2 (Fig. 1, A and B and Ref. 14Thuault S. Valcourt U. Petersen M. Manfioletti G. Heldin C.-H. Moustakas A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). We extended our analysis to members of the zinc-finger/homeobox domain family, ZEB1 (δEF-1) and ZEB2 (SIP-1), and observed that their expression can be induced by TGF-β1 (Fig. 1C), whereas HMGA2 overexpression was also capable of inducing their levels (Fig. 1D), albeit to a lower degree compared with Snail1 and Snail2 induction (Fig. 1B). We then analyzed expression of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors (Twist, E47, and E2-2) and observed weak but statistically significant induction of these three genes by TGF-β1 especially at late time points (Fig. 1, E and F), whereas HMGA2 overexpression led to specific and dramatic up-regulation of Twist but no significant regulation of E47 or E2-2 expression levels (Fig. 1G). These experiments demonstrated that HMGA2 regulates the expression of a diverse set of transcription factor genes involved in regulation of E-cadherin transcription. HMGA2 and TGF-β Cooperate to Activate the Snail1 Promoter—Among the seven transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, Snail1 exhibited immediate-early responses to TGF-β1 and robust up-regulation by HMGA2 (Fig. 1). Moreover, using a specific siRNA against Hmga2, we previously described that HMGA2 was required for full induction of Snail1 expression by TGF-β in mammary epithelial NMuMG cells (Ref. 14Thuault S. Valcourt U. Petersen M. Manfioletti G. Heldin C.-H. Moustakas A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar and reproduced in Fig. S1). Thus, we decided to analyze Snail1 gene expression regulation by TGF-β1 and HMGA2 in detail. We previously reported that HMGA2 activated a mouse Snail1 promoter-luciferase reporter containing 900 bp upstream of the ATG codon in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells (Ref. 14Thuault S. Valcourt U. Petersen M. Manfioletti G. Heldin C.-H. Moustakas A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar and reproduced in Fig. 2A). We also measured significant Snail1 promoter induction by TGF-β1 in HepG2 cells, which confirms additional previous reports from different cell systems (19Peinado H. Quintanilla M. Cano A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21113-21123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 20Cho H.J. Baek K.E. Saika S. Jeong M.J. Yoo J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). When combined, TGF-β1 and HMGA2 activated the Snail1 promoter to considerably higher levels than each factor alone (Fig. 2A). The TGF-β1 effect on Snail1 promoter induction could be recapitulated by co-expression of Smad3 together with Smad4, which caused a strong induction of the Snail1 promoter (Fig. 2B); however, when expressed alone Smad3 or Smad4 did not activate the Snail1 promoter (Fig. 2B). HMGA2 co-expressed with Smad3 or with Smad4 led to the net induction observed by HMGA2 alone. However, when HMGA2 was co-expressed with both Smad3 and Smad4, a dramatic super-induction of the Snail1 promoter was measured (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the endogenous levels of SNAIL1 protein weakly increased by co-transfection of Smad3 and Smad4 or HMGA2 but were super-activated by the combination of Smad3, Smad4, and HMGA2 in the same human HepG2 cells (Fig. 2C). Activation of the Snail1 promoter by HMGA2 is selective, as HMGA2 was not able to activate the CAGA12-Luc reporter, a classic Smad3/Smad4-dependent reporter (Fig. S2A). However, co-expression of HMGA2 with Smad3 and Smad4 led to a stronger activation of the CAGA12 reporter by Smad3/Smad4 (Fig. S2A). This stronger activation could be explained by a more efficient binding of the Smad3/Smad4 complex to the CAGA12 promoter sequence when HMGA2 is present. Indeed, in DNAP experiments, Smad3 bound to a 4× CAGA probe more efficiently when HMGA2 was co-expressed with Smad3 and Smad4, although HMGA2 itself did not bind to this Smad-specific DNA sequence (Fig. S2B). We then used deletion constructs of the Snail1 promoter to identify the region of the promoter required for its activation by HMGA2 and Smad3/Smad4 (Fig. 2D) (19Peinado H. Quintanilla M. Cano A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21113-21123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Deletion of the promoter up to -170 bp relative to the ATG codon had no effect on its induction by HMGA2 or by Smad3/Smad4. This shorter promoter fragment also exhibited the observed super-induction by the combination of HMGA2 and Smad3/Smad4. In contrast, deletion of the region from -170 to -110 bp abolished its activation by HMGA2 and by Smad3/Smad4 (Fig. 2D). A similar region was identified to be required for induction of the Snail1 promoter by TGF-β1 (Fig. S2C). We, therefore, conclude that HMGA2 and Smad proteins mediate a transcriptional effect on the Snail1 promoter via a short region in its proximal part. HMGA2 Binds to the Proximal Region of the Snail1 Promoter— We addressed HMGA2 binding to the Snail1 promoter by DNAP experiments using two biotinylated DNA probes encompassing the Snail1 promoter region previously identified to be required for its activation by HMGA2 and Smads (Fig. 3A, probes -131/-92 and -177/-132). HA-HMGA2 from transfected HepG2 cells bound to the probe covering the region between -131 and -92 (Fig. 3B). We identified two A/T-rich sequences as potential HMGA2-binding sites in this region of the Snail1 promoter. We mutated the first one (m1) or both of them (m2) (Fig. 3A) and assessed HMGA2 binding to these mutant probes in DNAP experiments. We observed a reduction of HMGA2 binding to the m1 mutant Snail1 promoter probe; this reduction was further"
https://openalex.org/W2103813752,"Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders of aging are characterized by clinical and pathological features that are relatively specific to humans. To obtain greater insight into how brain aging has evolved, we compared age-related gene expression changes in the cortex of humans, rhesus macaques, and mice on a genome-wide scale. A small subset of gene expression changes are conserved in all three species, including robust age-dependent upregulation of the neuroprotective gene apolipoprotein D (APOD) and downregulation of the synaptic cAMP signaling gene calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4). However, analysis of gene ontology and cell type localization shows that humans and rhesus macaques have diverged from mice due to a dramatic increase in age-dependent repression of neuronal genes. Many of these age-regulated neuronal genes are associated with synaptic function. Notably, genes associated with GABA-ergic inhibitory function are robustly age-downregulated in humans but not in mice at the level of both mRNA and protein. Gene downregulation was not associated with overall neuronal or synaptic loss. Thus, repression of neuronal gene expression is a prominent and recently evolved feature of brain aging in humans and rhesus macaques that may alter neural networks and contribute to age-related cognitive changes."

Adults showed high rates of natal homing to both eastern and western spawning areas. Trans-Atlantic movement (east to west) was significant and size-dependent, with individuals of Mediterranean origin mixing with the western population in the U.S. Atlantic. The largest (oldest) bluefin tuna collected near the northern extent of their range in North American waters were almost exclusively of western origin, indicating that this region represents critical habitat for the western population."
https://openalex.org/W2134810505,"Ceramide engagement in apoptotic pathways has been a topic of controversy. To address this controversy, we tested loss-of-function (lf) mutants of conserved genes of sphingolipid metabolism in Caenorhabditis elegans. Although somatic (developmental) apoptosis was unaffected, ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis of germ cells was obliterated upon inactivation of ceramide synthase and restored upon microinjection of long-chain natural ceramide. Radiation-induced increase in the concentration of ceramide localized to mitochondria and was required for BH3-domain protein EGL-1-mediated displacement of CED-4 (an APAF-1-like protein) from the CED-9 (a Bcl-2 family member)/CED-4 complex, an obligate step in activation of the CED-3 caspase. These studies define CEP-1 (the worm homolog of the tumor suppressor p53)-mediated accumulation of EGL-1 and ceramide synthase-mediated generation of ceramide through parallel pathways that integrate at mitochondrial membranes to regulate stress-induced apoptosis."

At shock coalescence, we observed rapid heating to temperatures of 25,000 kelvin when the scattering spectra show the collective plasmon oscillations that indicate the transition to the dense metallic plasma state. The plasmon frequency determines the material compression, which is found to be a factor of 3, thereby reaching conditions in the laboratory relevant for studying the physics of planetary formation."

Water inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can provide an ideal system for investigating such nanoconfined interfacial water on hydrophobic surfaces, provided that the nanotubes can be opened without introducing excess defects. Here, we report a hydrophobic-hydrophilic transition upon cooling from 22°C to 8°C via the observation of water adsorption isotherms in SWNTs measured by nuclear magnetic resonance. A considerable slowdown in molecular reorientation of such adsorbed water was also detected. The observed transition demonstrates that the structure of interfacial water could depend sensitively on temperature, which could lead to intriguing temperature dependences involving interfacial water on hydrophobic surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2084237466,"A commonly used strategy by microorganisms to survive multiple stresses involves a signal transduction cascade that increases the expression of stress-responsive genes. Stress signals can be integrated by a multiprotein signaling hub that responds to various signals to effect a single outcome. We obtained a medium-resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the 1.8-megadalton ""stressosome"" from Bacillus subtilis. Fitting known crystal structures of components into this reconstruction gave a pseudoatomic structure, which had a virus capsid-like core with sensory extensions. We suggest that the different sensory extensions respond to different signals, whereas the conserved domains in the core integrate the varied signals. The architecture of the stressosome provides the potential for cooperativity, suggesting that the response could be tuned dependent on the magnitude of chemophysical insult."

To account for this bioactivity, it has been proposed that fragments of pectin molecules can act by binding to and inhibiting the various roles of the mammalian protein galectin 3 (Gal3) in cancer progression and metastasis. Despite this clear molecular hypothesis and evidence for the bioactivity of modified pectin, the structural origins of the ""bioactive fragments"" of pectin molecules are currently ill defined. By using a combination of fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and force spectroscopy, it has been possible to demonstrate, for the first time, specific binding of a pectin galactan to the recombinant form of human Gal3. Present studies suggest that bioactivity resides in the neutral sugar side chains of pectin polysaccharides and that these components could be isolated and modified to optimize bioactivity."

Mitochondria play a central role in energy metabolism, other biosynthetic processes, Ca2+ signaling, and the integration of diverse apoptotic stimuli. Mitochondria establish networks of filamentous structures that continuously move, divide, and fuse (1Bach D. Pich S. Soriano F.X. Vega N. Baumgartner B. Oriola J. Daugaard J.R. Lloberas J. Camps M.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 79-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The major components of the fission machinery are Fis1 (3James D.I. Parone P.A. Mattenberger Y. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36373-36379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) (4Smirnova E. Griparic L. Shurland D.L. van der Bliek A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2245-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Fis1 is a small (17-kDa) protein, anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane (5Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5409-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Drp1 has a dynamin-like central domain and a C-terminal GTPase domain, which couples GTP hydrolysis to mitochondrial membrane constriction during fission (6Stojanovski D. Koutsopoulos O.S. Okamoto K. Ryan M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In the mitochondrial fission process, Fis1 has been suggested to be a limiting factor. The number of expressed Fis1 molecules on the mitochondrial outer surface determines the frequency of mitochondrial fission (5Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5409-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar).Mitochondrial fusion is regulated by mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) as well as Opa1 (2Chan D.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 79-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Mfn1 and Mfn2 are GTPases localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane that form homo- or hetero-oligomeric complexes during the fusion process. Mfn1 has higher GTPase activity and causes more efficient fusion than Mfn2 (7Ishihara N. Eura Y. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6535-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Suppression of mitofusin function promotes fission, yielding highly fragmented mitochondria (8Chen H. Chomyn A. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26185-26192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). A point mutation in the GTPase domain of Mfn1 (Mfn1T109A) allows the protein to act as a dominant-negative, inducing excessive fission when overexpressed (9Santel A. Frank S. Gaume B. Herrler M. Youle R.J. Fuller M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2763-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).The biological impact of the mitochondrial fission/fusion process is not restricted to structural changes. Fission and fusion allow mitochondria to exchange lipid membranes and intramitochondrial content including mtDNA (2Chan D.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 79-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Thus, damage in the organelle can be restored by fusion with healthy mitochondria (10Detmer S.A. Chan D.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 870-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dysfunctional parts of the reticulum can be separated by fission and selectively targeted to autophagy, which may protect cells from apoptosis by preventing the release of proapoptotic proteins (11Kim I. Rodriguez-Enriquez S. Lemasters J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 462: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 12Twig G. Elorza A. Molina A.J. Mohamed H. Wikstrom J.D. Walzer G.

Mitochondrial dynamics are also important during apoptosis as the organelle undergoes massive fragmentation during this process. For instance, overexpression of fission protein leads to apoptosis (3James D.I. Parone P.A. Mattenberger Y. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36373-36379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial fission/fusion proteins also directly or indirectly influence mitochondrial energy metabolism. Knock-out or down-regulation of fission or fusion proteins reduces mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation (13Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J.

In this cell type, mitochondria are of particular importance as they are both the center of energy production as well as the source of coupling factors that link nutrient metabolism to insulin exocytosis. Because of extremely low lactate dehydrogenase levels, more than 90% of glucose-derived carbons are funneled into the β-cell mitochondria (18Schuit F. De Vos A. Farfari S. Moens K. Pipeleers D.

These studies give a first insight into the possible importance of mitochondrial structure and dynamics for β-cell function, also raising the question whether mitochondrial structural changes contribute to the defects of the β-cell in the diabetic state. Here we have studied mitochondrial morphology in primary human and rat β-cells as well as INS-1E cells. Furthermore, we have manipulated the mitochondrial filamentous network and analyzed the impact of the resulting mitochondrial morphology changes on cell viability and metabolism-secretion coupling in INS-1E cells. The mitochondrial network was manipulated by overexpression of either hFis1 or dominant-negative Mfn1 (DN-Mfn1; Mfn1T109A). Overexpression of hFis1 deteriorated mitochondrial signal generation and insulin secretion, also causing a limited degree of apoptosis, whereas such changes were not observed in DN-Mfn1 4The abbreviations used are: DNdominant-negativeWTwild typeECFPmitochondrial targeted enhanced cyan fluorescent proteinmitoECFPmitochondrial targeted ECFPRFPred fluorescent proteinmitoRFPmitochondrial RFPFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling. 4The abbreviations used are: DNdominant-negativeWTwild typeECFPmitochondrial targeted enhanced cyan fluorescent proteinmitoECFPmitochondrial targeted ECFPRFPred fluorescent proteinmitoRFPmitochondrial RFPFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling.-overexpressing cells. We suggest that hFis1 induces a specific metabolic defect in the β-cell. This defect is not simply due to fragmentation of the mitochondria as massive fragmentation caused by DN-Mfn1 did not mimic any of these defects.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—Human pancreatic islets were isolated from two different donors obtained through the EURODIA European Union sixth framework programme consortium (25Del Guerra S. Lupi R. Marselli L. Masini M. Bugliani M. Sbrana S. Torri S. Pollera M. Boggi U. Mosca F. Del Prato S. Marchetti P. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Rat islets were isolated from male Wistar rats (250 g, Elevage Janvier, Le Genest-St-Isle, France) after collagenase digestion. Islets were dissociated with 0.02% trypsin and seeded on coverslips coated with A431 cell-derived extracellular matrix (26Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20770-20778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Human islet cells were cultured in CMRL-1066 (Invitrogen) medium at 5.6 mm glucose supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma). Rat islet cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (11.1 mm glucose, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. INS-1E cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere (37 °C) containing 5% CO2 in complete medium composed of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection of INS-1E cells was performed using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen).Adenovirus Construction and Infection—Doxycycline-inducible adenoviruses encoding hFis1, WT-Mfn1, and DN-Mfn1 were constructed using the Adeno-X Tet-On expression system (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Adenoviruses encoding the transgene were applied together with the adenovirus expressing the reverse tetracycline-transactivator (Clontech laboratories, Inc.) to islet cells and INS-1E cells for 90–120 min 1 day after seeding (27Brun T.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Mitochondrial Morphology—Mitochondria of human and rat islet cells were visualized following infection with adenovirus encoding enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (mitoECFP). Human β-cells were identified by immunohistochemical staining of insulin as described previously (28Ishihara H. Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Herrera P.L. Wollheim C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). INS-1E cells were transfected with mitochondria-targeted red fluorescence protein (mitoRFP) plasmid followed by infection with adenoviruses. Mitochondrial morphology was observed 48 h after infection and analyzed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510meta, Zeiss, Zurich, Switzerland) after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Mitochondrial volume and skeleton length were calculated as described in supplemental Figs. S3 and S4.Western Blot—Total protein extracts (50 μg) were resolved by 11% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% milk and then incubated with first antibodies: anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:8000; Sigma), anti-hFis1 (1:1000) (29Alirol E.

Anti-chicken and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Sigma) were used as secondary antibodies.Glucose-stimulated Insulin Secretion—INS-1E cells seeded on 24-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) were infected with adenoviruses. After 48 h, infected cells were preincubated with glucose-free medium for 2 h subsequently with KRBH buffer (135 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 2.8 mm glucose for 30 min. The cells were then stimulated for 30 min in KRBH buffer at different glucose concentrations. Insulin was measured by rat insulin enzyme immunoassay kit (Spi-Bio, Montigny le Bretonneux, France).Cellular ATP Content and Lactate Production—For the measurement of ATP content and lactate production, INS-1E cells were prepared as described for insulin secretion. Total cellular ATP was measured using a bioluminescence assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (HS II, Roche Diagnostics). Lactate in the cell supernatant was measured using a lactate assay kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA).Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential— INS-1E cells were seeded (5 × 104 cells/well) on black-walled 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) and infected with adenoviruses. Cells were cultured for 48 h and then loaded with 500 nm JC-1 (Invitrogen) in KRBH buffer (2.8 mm glucose) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing twice, JC-1 fluorescence was measured ratiometrically using a Flex-Station (Molecular Devices) with excitation/emission wavelengths of 490/540 nm (green; monomer) and 540/590 nm (red; J-aggregates). Changes in fluorescence ratios from basal levels were normalized to ratio differences between resting and maximal depolarization induced by 10 μm FCCP, and expressed as the percentage of changes ((R - RFCCP)/(R0 - RFCCP) × 100) (30Zhang Y.

Cells grown on glass coverslips were transiently co-transfected with mitochondrial fission genes, mitoRFP and YC3.6, and cultured for 72 h. The cells were placed on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200 m, Zeiss) equipped with an array laser confocal spinning disk (QLC100; VisiTech, Sunderland, UK). Cells expressing YC3.6 were excited at 440 nm. The fluorescent images were acquired at 490 and 535 nm emission wavelengths using a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CoolSnap HQ; Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) and analyzed using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). [Ca2+]i was calculated from the intensity ratio of two emission wavelengths (F535/F490) according to Nagai et al. (31Nagai T. Yamada S. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10554-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial calcium ([Ca2+]mito) was measured using mitochondrial-targeted aequorin as described (28Ishihara H. Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Herrera P.L. Wollheim C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).Data Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSMitochondrial Morphology in Pancreatic β-Cells and INS-1E Cells—To visualize the mitochondria of primary pancreatic β-cells, we generated a virus encoding mito-ECFP. ECFP-labeled mitochondria formed tubular networks throughout the cytosol in the majority of human and rat β-cells (Fig. 1A; supplemental Fig. S1A). β-cells were identified by immunofluorescence labeling with an insulin antibody (Fig. 1A). The rat clonal β-cell line INS-1E displays a similar filamentous pattern of mitochondrial distribution as analyzed either with the mitoECFP virus or following transient transfection of mitoRFP (Fig. 2A and data not shown). To manipulate the mitochondrial filamentous network, INS-1E cells were co-transfected with genes of the fission/fusion machinery and mitoRFP. Overexpression of hFis1, DN-Mfn1, or Drp1 caused mitochondrial fragmentation in a large fraction of transfected cells (Fig. 2A, supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). In contrast, overexpression of WT-Mfn1 and WT-Mfn2 caused the aggregation of mitochondria (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2B).FIGURE 2Mitochondrial morphology in INS-1E cells overexpressing fission/fusion genes. INS-1E cells were transiently transfected with mitoRFP to visualize the mitochondria. Following adenovirus infection, the fission/fusion proteins were induced by 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 48 h, and morphological changes were studied. A, representative confocal images show mitochondrial distribution and structure in cells after overexpression of hFis1, WT-Mfn1, and DN-Mfn1. B, the number of cells with tubular, shortened (rod shape), or fragmented (small round) mitochondria is expressed as the percentage of total mitoRFP-transfected cells (left and middle graph). Cells with clumped (aggregated) mitochondria were counted following induction of WT-Mfn1 (right graph). Data are presented as means ± S.E. (n = 6, for each experiment, more than 200 cells were counted). Mitochondrial volume normalized to cytosol was calculated from deconvoluted z-stack confocal images (see supplemental Fig. S4). Mean mitochondrial length (C) and mitochondrial volume (D) were compared between cells expressing different transgenes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Among the fission/fusion genes tested, we decided to further focus on the role of hFis1 and DN-Mfn1 in insulin-secreting cells. First, we focused on them because hFis1 and Mfn1 mediate key, possibly rate-limiting, steps in fission and fusion, respectively. Second, they induced a pronounced effect on mitochondrial morphology in the majority of the expressing cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Third, we focused on them because hFis1 and DN-Mfn1 utilize different mechanisms to cause a very similar fragmentation phenotype. Overexpression of Mfn1 was further studied as it caused a mitochondrial morphology defect different from the other two transgenes. For this purpose, we generated adenoviruses for doxycycline-inducible expression of the transgenes in whole populations of INS-1E cells and primary β-cells. Doxycycline-dependent induction of hFis1 (17-kDa) and DN-Mfn1 (84-kDa) protein following infection of INS-1E cells is shown in Fig. 1C. Virus-mediated expression of the transgenes caused morphological changes of the mitochondria in INS-1E cells similar to those observed after transient transfection (Fig. 2B). Similarly, hFis1 overexpression led to the fragmentation of mitochondria in human (Fig. 1B) and rat β-cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). To get a quantitative read-out of the fragmentation phenotype in individual cells, we measured the average length of mitochondria. For this purpose, the mitochondria were “skeletonized” using Metamorph as illustrated in supplemental Fig. S3. This technique allows us to study relative length changes of mitochondria, albeit without taking into consideration mitochondrial distribution over several planes of the z axis. Mean mitochondrial skeleton length of human pancreatic β-cells and rat β-cells was markedly decreased by the overexpression of hFis1 (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1C). Adenovirus-driven overexpression of hFis1 or DN-Mfn1 elicited similar mitochondrial shortening and fragmentation in INS-1E cells (Fig. 2C). Despite the comparable fragmentation phenotype after induction of either of these two transgenes, we noticed that hFis1 overexpression reduced the mitochondrial area (mitoRFP staining) in the INS-1E cells, possibly reflecting a reduction in mitochondrial volume. To quantify this difference, we calculated the total mitochondrial area relative to the cell size from whole z-stack images of INS-1E cells. The area covered by the cell was measured with the plasma membrane targeted probe YC3.6 pm as described previously (32Frieden M. Arnaudeau S. Castelbou C. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43198-43208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and illustrated in supplemental Fig. S4, A–C. The filamentous mitochondria of control INS-1E cells reach the peripheral subplasmalemmal area of the cytosol (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S4A). Overexpression of hFis1 caused clustering of mitochondria in the perinuclear area and therefore a reduction of the area occupied by the fragmented mitochondria (Fig. 2, A and D, and supplemental Fig. S4D). In contrast, the fragmented mitochondria of DN-Mfn1-overexpressing cells reached the cell periphery like in control cells (Fig. 2, A and D, and supplemental Fig. S4F). Mitochondrial aggregation, the consequences of WT-Mfn1 overexpression, also resulted in a relative decrease of area occupied by mitochondria in the cell (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S4E).hFis1 Induced Apoptotic Cell Death—Several fission/fusion genes have been found to modulate the apoptotic response (3James D.I. Parone P.A. Mattenberger Y. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36373-36379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 33Lee Y.J. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of hFis1 and DN-Mfn1 on cell viability in the INS-1E cells, we used the colorimetric MTT assay (34Janjic D. Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Increasing the virus titer or the doxycycline concentration caused a dose-dependent reduction of the MTT-derived signal, suggesting that the observed defect was proportional to the level of hFis1 expression (supplemental Fig. S5A and data not shown). After infection with the hFis1 virus (60 infection units/cell) and induction of the transgene with 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 48 h (the condition used throughout this study), we observed a decrease of the MTT signal to 66 ± 4% of control. In contrast, overexpression of DN-Mfn1 did not significantly alter cell viability even after infection with 120 infection units/cell of the adenovirus (supplemental Fig. S5A). The 34% reduction of the MTT signal after hFis1 overexpression does not, however, necessarily reflect cell death or loss as the MTT assay also measures the generation of reducing equivalents in this cell type (34Janjic D. Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For instance, the observed reduction of mitochondrial volume as demonstrated in Fig. 2D could lower the amount of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, one of the main enzymes catalyzing the reduction of MTT. As an alternative measure of cell death or loss, we therefore also monitored the total amount of DNA after extraction. Total DNA content per well was lowered by 10% after hFis1 overexpression (8.18 ± 0.42 in non-induced versus 7.36 ± 0.39 μg/well in induced cells, n = 11, p < 0.01). The MTT assay may therefore overestimate the effect of hFis1 on cell death.To determine whether the reduced cell number is due to apoptosis, we employed the TUNEL assay. Doxycycline induction (500 ng/ml for 24 h) of hFis1 increased the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells 2.5-fold when compared with that of the non-induced control (supplemental Fig. S5, B and C). DN-Mfn1 overexpression did not increase the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells. Our results show that hFis1 only causes a modest decrease of cell number when overexpressed, which may be explained by the increased percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis.hFis1 Lowered Cellular ATP Levels and Augmented Lactate Production—Fission/fusion genes may directly affect mitochondrial metabolism as suggested by others (8Chen H. Chomyn A. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26185-26192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 14Benard G. Bellance N. James D. Parrone P. Fernandez H. Letellier T. Rossignol R. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether hFis1 overexpression could have an impact on energy metabolism by measuring total cellular ATP content (Fig. 3A). ATP is expressed relative to the DNA content of the samples to correct for the moderate reduction of cell number after overexpression of hFis1. Incubation with stimulating glucose concentration (16.5 mm) for 10 min increased ATP content from 70.7 ± 15.4 to 94.1 ± 19.4 pmol/μg of DNA (p < 0.05) in control INS-1E cells. hFis1 overexpression lowered ATP content at basal (52.3 ± 9.2 pmol/μg of DNA, p < 0.05) and stimulating glucose concentrations (71.3 ± 12.6 pmol/μg of DNA, p < 0.01, Fig. 3A). On the other hand, DN-Mfn1 neither affected cellular ATP levels at low glucose nor affected cellular ATP levels at high glucose (67.7 ± 11.5 and 93.3 ± 10.9 pmol/μg of DNA, respectively). Overexpression of WT-Mfn1 reduced the ATP content at basal (49.8 ± 8.5 pmol/μg of DNA, p < 0.01) and stimulating glucose concentration (62.0 ± 10.3 pmol/μg o"
https://openalex.org/W1963604934,"Aging is one major risk factor for numerous diseases. The enzyme telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) plays an important role for aging and apoptosis. Previously, we demonstrated that inhibition of oxidative stress-induced Src kinase family-dependent nuclear export of TERT results in delayed replicative senescence and reduced apoptosis sensitivity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate mechanisms inhibiting nuclear export of TERT. First, we demonstrated that H2O2-induced nuclear export of TERT was abolished in Src, Fyn, and Yes-deficient embryonic fibroblasts. Next, we wanted to identify one potential negative regulator of this export process. One candidate is the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 (Shp-2), which can counteract activities of the Src kinase family. Indeed, Shp-2 was evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytosol. Nuclear Shp-2 associates with TERT in endothelial cells and dissociates from TERT prior to its nuclear export. Overexpression of Shp-2 wt inhibited H2O2-induced export of TERT. Overexpression of the catalytically inactive, dominant negative Shp-2 mutant (Shp-2(C459S)) reduced endogenous as well as overexpressed nuclear TERT protein and telomerase activity, whereas it had no influence on TERT(Y707F). Binding of TERT(Y707F) to Shp-2 is reduced compared with TERTwt. Ablation of Shp-2 expression led only to an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of TERTwt, but not of TERT(Y707F). Moreover, reduced Shp-2 expression decreased nuclear telomerase activity, whereas nuclear telomerase activity was increased in Shp-2-overexpressing endothelial cells. In conclusion, Shp-2 retains TERT in the nucleus by regulating tyrosine 707 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1969395847,"FGF19 subfamily proteins (FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23) are unique members of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that regulate energy, bile acid, glucose, lipid, phosphate, and vitamin D homeostasis in an endocrine fashion. Their activities require the presence of α or βKlotho, two related single-pass transmembrane proteins, as co-receptors in relevant target tissues. We previously showed that FGF19 can bind to both α and βKlotho, whereas FGF21 and FGF23 can bind only to either βKlotho or αKlotho, respectively in vitro. To determine the mechanism regulating the binding and specificity among FGF19 subfamily members to Klotho family proteins, chimeric proteins between FGF19 subfamily members or chimeric proteins between Klotho family members were constructed to probe the interaction between those two families. Our results showed that a chimera of FGF19 with the FGF21 C-terminal tail interacts only with βKlotho and a chimera with the FGF23 C-terminal tail interacts only with αKlotho. FGF signaling assays also reflected the change of specificity we observed for the chimeras. These results identified the C-terminal tail of FGF19 as a region necessary for its recognition of Klotho family proteins. In addition, chimeras between α and βKlotho were also generated to probe the regions in Klotho proteins that are important for signaling by this FGF subfamily. Both FGF23 and FGF21 require intact α or βKlotho for signaling, respectively, whereas FGF19 can signal through a Klotho chimera consisting of the N terminus of αKlotho and the C terminus of βKlotho. Our results provide the first glimpse of the regions that regulate the binding specificity between this unique family of FGFs and their co-receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2018206879,"Background In many neuroinflammatory diseases, dendritic cells (DCs) accumulate in several compartments of the central nervous system (CNS), including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Myeloid DCs invading the inflamed CNS are thus thought to play a major role in the initiation and perpetuation of CNS-targeted autoimmune responses. We previously reported that, in normal rats, DCs injected intra-CSF migrated outside the CNS and reached the B-cell zone of cervical lymph nodes. However, there is yet no information on the migratory behavior of CSF-circulating DCs under neuroinflammatory conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings To address this issue, we performed in vivo transfer experiments in rats suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis. EAE or control rats were injected intra-CSF with bone marrow-derived myeloid DCs labeled with the fluorescent marker carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). In parallel experiments, fluorescent microspheres were injected intra-CSF to EAE rats in order to track endogenous antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Animals were then sacrificed on day 1 or 8 post-injection and their brain and peripheral lymph nodes were assessed for the presence of microspheres+ APCs or CFSE+ DCs by immunohistology and/or FACS analysis. Data showed that in EAE rats, DCs injected intra-CSF substantially infiltrated several compartments of the inflamed CNS, including the periventricular demyelinating lesions. We also found that in EAE rats, as compared to controls, a larger number of intra-CSF injected DCs reached the cervical lymph nodes. This migratory behavior was accompanied by an accentuation of EAE clinical signs and an increased systemic antibody response against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, a major immunogenic myelin antigen. Conclusions/Significance Altogether, these results indicate that CSF-circulating DCs are able to both survey the inflamed brain and to reach the cervical lymph nodes. In EAE and maybe multiple sclerosis, CSF-circulating DCs may thus support the immune responses that develop within and outside the inflamed CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2044990701,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an activated oncogene in many cancers. It can be transactivated by ligands of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We show here that a novel gene, human rhomboid family-1 (RHBDF1), which was recently reported to have a pivotal role in epithelial cancer cell growth in culture and in xenograft tumors, participates in the modulation of GPCR-mediated EGFR transactivation. The RHBDF1 protein localizes mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum. Silencing the RHBDF1 gene in head and neck squamous cancer cell line 1483 cells with siRNA causes an inhibition of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) -induced phosphorylation of EGFR and EGFR-dependent signaling proteins p44/42 MAPK and AKT, accompanied by an inhibition of GRP-induced survival, proliferation, and invasion of the cells. The EGFR signaling pathway itself remains intact, however, as the cells remain responsive to exogenous EGF. In addition, RHBDF1 gene silencing disrupts GRP-stimulated secretion of EGFR ligand TGF-alpha, but not the production of latent TGF-alpha, whereas engineered overexpression of RHBDF1 markedly accelerates the secretion of TGF-alpha. These findings are consistent with the view that RHBDF1 is critically involved in a GPCR ligand-stimulated process leading to the activation of latent EGFR ligands."

Here we have characterized heterodimeric (dMyD88-Tube) and heterotrimeric (dMyD88-Tube-Pelle) death domain complexes.

It is activated by direct binding of the ligand Spätzle (3Weber A.N.R. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J.A. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K.P. Morse M.A. Imler J.-L. Gay N.J. Nat.

Cell. 1989; 56: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and by another serine protease, Spätzle-processing enzyme, during Toll-dependent antimicrobial and fungal responses (5Jang I.-H. Chosa N. Kim S.-H. Nam H.-J. Lemaitre B. Ochiai M. Kambris Z. Brun S. Hashimoto C. Ashida M. Brey P.T. Lee W.-J. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Activation of the Toll pathway during development sets in motion a series of events that culminate in the translocation of the Rel/NF-κB family member Dorsal into the nucleus and the activation of the zygotic genes twist and snail on the ventral side of the embryos and the deactivation of zerknullt and decapentaplegic on the dorsal side (6Ray R.P. Arora K. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Gelbart W.M. Development. 1991; 113: 35-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas activation resulting from an immune challenge leads to the nuclear translocation of the Dorsal-related immunity factor (Dif) and the subsequent transcription of many genes including those encoding the antimicrobial peptides Drosomycin and Metchnikowin (7Meng X. Khanuja B.S. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 8Rutschmann S. Jung A.C. Hetru C. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Ferrandon D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In mammals, an immune response is mounted as a result of challenge by a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns with the activation of a homologous Toll-like receptor pathway of which approximately 11 distinct members have been identified (9Lee M.S. Kim Y.-J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 447-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar).Signaling from the activated Toll receptor to the relevant transcription factors relies on interactions between adaptor proteins that associate with the TIR domain of Toll and subsequently influence interactions between other downstream components of the pathway. In Drosophila, the immediate post-receptor events are context-dependent; during an innate immune response, for example, the proteins involved are dMyD88, Tube, and Pelle (10Sun H. Bristow B.N. Qu G. Wasserman S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12871-12876Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whereas an additional zinc finger adaptor, Weckle, is required for dorsoventral patterning of the embryo (11Chen L.-Y. Wang J.-C. Hyvert Y. Lin H.-P. Perrimon N. Imler J.-L. Hsu J.-C. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1183-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These adaptors with the exception of Weckle all have an interaction motif belonging to the death domain (DD) superfamily, and additionally dMyD88 possesses a TIR domain (12Tauszig-Delamasure S. Bilak H. Capovilla M. Hoffmann J.A. Imler J.-L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and Pelle a kinase domain (13Shelton C.A. Wasserman S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 515-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). One model of the signal transduction events downstream of the Toll receptor posits that upon activation dimeric Toll recruits a membrane-localized dMyD88-Tube DD-DD heterodimer (14Sun H. Towb P. Chiem D.N. Foster B.A. Wasserman S.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) via interactions between the TIR domains of Toll and dMyD88. This heterotrimeric complex then recruits Pelle, which undergoes autophosphorylation (15Shen B. Manley J.L. Development. 1998; 125: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pelle then phosphorylates Toll and Tube (14Sun H. Towb P. Chiem D.N. Foster B.A. Wasserman S.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) before being released from the complex. There is evidence that both Cactus and Dorsal are targets of activated Pelle (16Edwards D.N. Towb P. Wasserman S.A. Development. 1997; 124: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Drier E.A. Huang L.H. Steward R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and a possible scenario is that Pelle, or a currently unidentified kinase, phosphorylates Cactus, which releases Dorsal, and then Dorsal in turn is phosphorylated and enters the nucleus (18Isoda K. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5350-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An alternative model for the early events in the Toll pathway that was proposed before the role of dMyD88 was known suggests that a presignaling complex consisting of the TIR domain of Toll, Pelle, and Tube exists and that Spätzle binding and subsequent Toll dimerization results in the transphosphorylation of Pelle followed by the cascade of events as described previously (19Shen B. Manley J.L. Development. 2002; 129: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).From the preceding, DD-DD interactions are crucial for the transduction of the signal from the activated Toll receptor. The canonical death domain revealed initially by the NMR solution structure of the Fas DD has a six-helix bundle fold (20Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 21Fesik S.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 273-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of the heterodimeric Pelle-Tube DD-DD (22Xiao T. Towb P. Wasserman S.A. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and the CARD-CARD Apaf-1-Procaspase-9 complexes have been solved crystallographically. On the basis of the different interactions comprising the interface of these structures and the interactions obtained by superimposing Pelle onto Procaspase-9 of the Apaf-1-Procaspase-9 complex, three types of interactions were defined. Type I interactions, typified by the CARD-CARD interface, involve charge-charge contacts between the second and third helices of Apaf-1 and the first and fourth helices of Procaspase-9. Type II interactions are observed in the Pelle-Tube DD interface in which helix 4 of Pelle interacts with a groove formed by three helices (helices 1, 2, and 6) of Tube, and the C-terminal tail of Tube interacts with a groove on Pelle created by helices 2, 3, and 5. Type III interactions are a combination of Type I and Type II and are characterized by contacts between helix 3 of Apaf-1 with the loops between the first and second helices and third and fourth helices of Tube (23Weber C.H. Vincenz C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 475-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Additionally a docking model of the Fas-FADD DD revealed that a hexameric complex was possible implying that death domains have the potential for forming multivalent interactions (24Weber C.H. Vincenz C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This prediction has been substantiated by the only oligomeric DD-DD structure to date, the PIDD-RAIDD complex (25Park H.H. Logette E. Raunser S. Cuenin S. Walz T. Tschopp J. Wu H. Cell. 2007; 128: 533-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This asymmetric complex consists of five PIDD and seven RAIDD molecules, and the interactions at the different interfaces belong to the three types described previously (24Weber C.H. Vincenz C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggesting that such interactions may be sufficient to define the assembly of DD-DD complexes.Regarding the DD complexes involved in Toll signaling, solution data (26Schiffmann D.A. White J.H. Cooper A. Nutley M.A. Harding S.E. Jumel K. Solari R. Ray K.P. Gay N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11722-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Moncrieffe M.C. Stott K.M. Gay N.J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3920-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) strongly suggest a 1:1 interaction between Pelle and Tube. The crystal structure of the Pelle-Tube complex, although prepared from a heterodimeric DD solution, revealed a tetramer in the asymmetric unit consisting of two Pelle-Tube heterodimers arranged in a linear array (P1:T1:P2: T2) (22Xiao T. Towb P. Wasserman S.A. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We have suggested, given the bivalent nature of the Tube DD, that the T1:P2 interface observed crystallographically may be the binding site for other members of the complex.In the present study we used a variety of biophysical techniques including analytical ultracentrifugation, isothermal titration calorimetry, and small angle x-ray scattering to probe the nature and affinity of the DD complexes involved in postreceptor Toll signaling. We suggest a model for the immediate postreceptor events.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSample Preparation—The expression and purification of Pelle DD and Tube DD has been described previously (27Moncrieffe M.C. Stott K.M. Gay N.J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3920-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of the death domain of Drosophila MyD88 was similar to that of Pelle DD and Tube DD with the exception that protein expression was done using Rosetta (Novagen) cells. The MyD88-Tube DD complex was formed by adding a slight molar excess of dMyD88 DD to purified Tube DD, and the resulting protein solution was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex-75 (Amersham Biosciences) size exclusion column and eluted with 20 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. The heterotrimeric Pelle-Tube-MyD88 DD complex was made by adding excess purified Pelle DD to purified dMyD88-Tube DD. For small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements excess Pelle DD was removed using a Superdex-75 size exclusion column as done before for the dMyD88-Tube complex.Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity measurements were performed using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance and interference optics. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments on the dMyD88-Tube complex were performed using 180-μl sample volumes and three concentrations (0.04, 0.02, and 0.01 mg/ml obtained by serial dilution of a solution obtained as a single peak from a size exclusion column). This provided a powerful constraint in data analysis as the ratio of the concentrations of Tube and dMyD88 was fixed at 1.0. Absorption (230 and 280 nm) and interference data were acquired at three rotor speeds (13,000, 19,000, and 25,000 rpm) using an An60-Ti (Beckman Coulter) rotor after the time taken for the attainment of equilibrium (48 h) at each speed. The molar absorptivities of Tube and dMyD88 DD at 230 and 280 nm were determined using the Edelhoch (28Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar) method. Partial specific volumes, buffer density, and viscosity were calculated using SEDNTERP, and the data were analyzed with SEDPHAT (29Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were also performed using protein concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml for both the dMyD88-Tube and the dMyD88-Tube-Pelle complexes. Sedimentation velocity data for the Tube-dMyD88 (0.1 mg/ml) DD complex and a mixture of the Pelle and dMyD88 (0.2 mg/ml) death domains were obtained using a rotor speed of 60,000 rpm and the interference optical system. Typically 100 scans were acquired every 2 min, and the data were analyzed using the program SEDFIT (30Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The association constants characterizing the binding of Tube to dMyD88 and of Pelle DD to a Tube-dMyD88 complex were obtained from measurements made on a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter at 20 °C. Protein concentrations for the Tube-dMyD88 interaction were 5 and 50 μm and for Pelle binding to Tube-dMyD88 were 4.86 (Pelle) and 119 μm. Data were reduced using the Origin software package and then analyzed using SEDPHAT (31Houtman J.C.D. Brown P.H. Bowden B. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Samelson L.E. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).SAXS—X-ray scattering data of the Tube-dMyD88 and Pelle-Tube-dMyD88 complexes in solution were collected at 4 °C at the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Daresbury, UK) using sample-to-detector distances of 1 and 4.5 m. Protein concentrations ranged between 2.5 and 10 mg/ml for the Tube-dMyD88 complex and 2.5 and 5 mg/ml for the Pelle-Tube-dMyD88 complex. The scattering data at both detector distances for each sample were merged, and the Fourier transform method implemented in the program GNOM (32Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2910) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the radius of gyration (Rg) and the maximum molecular dimension (Dmax) via the distance distribution function P(r). The scattering profiles were then used in ab initio shape restorations using the program GASBOR (33Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Eighty independent shape reconstructions were performed for each complex assuming no symmetry constraints. The resulting shapes were then aligned, averaged, and filtered using the DAMAVER (34Volkov V. Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) and SUPCOMB (35Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 9Crossref Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) packages. Docking of the high resolution Pelle-Tube DD structure (Protein Data Bank code 1D2Z) into the low resolution SAXS model was performed using the SITUS suite of programs (36Chacón P. Wriggers W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 37Wriggers W. Chacon P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 773-776Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe Tube-dMyD88 DD Complex Is Stable—Tube and dMyD88 each contain a DD, a structural motif that associates via homotypic interactions in which DD-DD interactions are formed exclusively. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a substantial interaction between the death domains of Tube and dMyD88 (10Sun H. Bristow B.N. Qu G. Wasserman S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12871-12876Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine the oligomeric state of the Tube-dMyD88 DD complex we performed sedimentation velocity experiments on a solution of these proteins obtained as a single peak from a Superdex-75 (Amersham Biosciences) size exclusion column. Fig. 1a shows the experimental profiles; the sedimentation coefficient distribution, c(S); and the residuals obtained after fitting the data with SEDFIT (30Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar). The r.m.s.d. of the fit was 0.005, and the recovered frictional coefficient was 1.49. The c(S) distribution shows a single peak at 2.55 S corresponding to a molecular mass of 36 kDa. The recovered molecular mass is within 3% of the molecular weight calculated from the sequence assuming a 1:1 DD-DD complex. The molecular weight obtained from the sedimentation velocity experiments was confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium experiments (Fig. 2) performed on multiple concentrations of the complex and three rotor speeds. Additionally sedimentation equilibrium measurements performed on higher concentrations (0.1 mg/ml) yielded results identical to those at low concentrations and to that obtained from analysis of the sedimentation velocity data. The sedimentation coefficient of the Pelle-Tube DD complex (27Moncrieffe M.C. Stott K.M. Gay N.J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3920-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was 2.54 S, which, within experimental error, is identical to that of the Tube-dMyD88 complex suggesting that the shape adopted by these heterodimers is similar. The hydrodynamic radius of the Tube-dMyD88 complex calculated from the value of the sedimentation coefficient is 3.37 nm. If the complex is modeled as an oblate spheroid having a degree of hydration of 0.4 mg/ml, the maximum linear dimension is 9.8 nm, whereas for a prolate spheroid the value is 17.3 nm.FIGURE 2Sedimentation equilibrium profiles of the dMyD88-Tube death domain complex. Shown are interference (c and e) and absorbance data at 280 (a) and 230 nm (b and d) that were acquired at rotor speeds of 13,000, 19,000, and 25,000 rpm and sample concentrations of 0.04 (a–c) and 0.02 mg/ml (d and e). Data were analyzed with global implicit mass conservation constraints, and the local r.m.s.d. of each fit is shown in the corresponding plot. The residuals after fitting are shown below the exponential curves for each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)dMyD88 Binds Tube with High Affinity—Having established that the isolated death domains of dMyD88 and Tube form a stable complex in solution we sought to determine the strength of the association. The only published data detailing the strength of the interaction between death domain complexes is that of Schiffman et al. (26Schiffmann D.A. White J.H. Cooper A. Nutley M.A. Harding S.E. Jumel K. Solari R. Ray K.P. Gay N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11722-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) who reported a Kd value of 0.64 μm for the interaction between an N-Tube (residues 1–257) and N-Pelle (residues 1–208) DD construct. The measured Kd obtained using isothermal titration calorimetry for the Pelle-Tube DD complex used in the present work was 0.5 μm (data not shown), which is similar to that obtained for the larger complex. An estimate of the Kd for the interaction between the death domains of Tube and dMyD88 was obtained from sedimentation equilibrium data collected at three concentrations and utilizing multiple rotor speeds and optical detection methods. Data were analyzed with global implicit mass conservation constraints as implemented in the program SEDPHAT (29Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the sedimentation equilibrium profiles obtained for two concentrations (0.04 and 0.02 mg/ml) of the Pelle-Tube DD complex and the local r.m.s.d. of the fits. The data are of excellent quality, and the Kd value obtained was 32 nm. To evaluate the reliability of the recovered Kd values, F-statistics and the error surface projection method implemented in SEDPHAT were used to calculate the critical χ2 value; the Kd values were then subsequently fixed at successively non-optimal values, and the χ2 was recalculated. This analysis suggested that the Kd value of 32 nm obtained was an upper limit and that the binding was likely to be stronger. To obtain a more accurate estimate for the strength of the interaction between the death domains of dMyD88 and Tube we used isothermal titration calorimetry. Fig. 3a shows the binding isotherm fitted to a single site model in SEDPHAT (31Houtman J.C.D. Brown P.H. Bowden B. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Samelson L.E. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The Kd value obtained from this analysis was 1.2 nm with a ΔH value of -8.98 kcal/mol and a stoichiometry of 1:1.2. Thus, the interaction between the death domains of dMyD88 and Tube is of very high affinity and is greater, by more than 2 orders of magnitude, than that between the death domains of Tube and Pelle.FIGURE 3Isothermal titration calorimetry of the interactions between the death domains of Tube and dMyD88 (a) and between the death domains of Tube-dMyD88 DD and Pelle (b). The data after subtraction of the buffer control are shown (○) as are the fit to a single site model and the resulting residuals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pelle DD Binds to the dMyD88-Tube DD Complex with High Affinity—The heterotrimeric complex comprising the Pelle, Tube, and dMyD88 death domains was obtained by adding a slight excess of purified Pelle DD to a purified preexisting Tube-dMyD88. Sedimentation velocity measurements were performed on the resulting solution to confirm the presence of the heterotrimer. The c(S) distribution (Fig. 1b) obtained from an analysis of this data shows two peaks at 1.42 and 3.24 S. The corresponding molecular masses from a c(M) analysis were 14 and 46 kDa, which are within 9 and 8% of the molecular weights calculated from the sequence of the Pelle DD and the Pelle-Tube-dMyD88 death domains, respectively. The molecular weight of the dMyD88-Tube-Pelle complex was also confirmed using sedimentation equilibrium experiments (data not shown) and is, within experimental error, identical to that derived from the sedimentation velocity data. The r.m.s.d. of the fit was 0.005, and the value of the frictional coefficient was 1.42. The hydrodynamic radius of the heterotrimeric Pelle-Tube-dMyD88 complex, calculated from the sedimentation coefficient value is 3.55 nm. The maximum linear dimension for a prolate and oblate spheroid assuming a degree of hydration of 0.4 mg/ml were 16.85 and 10 nm, respectively. The dissociation constant for the interaction between Pelle DD and the Tube-dMyD88 death domain complex was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 3b). Data were fitted to a single site model and the Kd value obtained was 51 nm, and ΔH was -9.54 kcal/mol. Thus, the binding of Pelle DD to the Tube-MyD88 DD complex is cooperative and is enhanced approximately 12-fold relative to the binding of the isolated Pelle DD to the DD of Tube.No Interaction between the Pelle and dMyD88 Death Domains—An interaction between the death domains of dMyD88 and Pelle has been implied by several studies (12Tauszig-Delamasure S. Bilak H. Capovilla M. Hoffmann J.A. Imler J.-L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 38Horng T. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12654-12658Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We used sedimentation velocity to assess the extent of the interaction between these death domains in vitro. Fig. 4a shows the experimental sedimentation profiles of a solution containing a mixture of Pelle and dMyD88 death domains and the c(S) distribution after fitting. The peak in the c(S) distribution is at 1.41 S, which corresponds to a molecular mass of 16 kDa. The recovered frictional coefficient was 1.59, and the r.m.s.d. of the fit was 0.009. The c(S) analysis assumes that all sedimenting particles have the same weight average frictional coefficient, a condition that may not be valid for the Pelle and dMyD88 death domains. A subsequent two-dimensional analysis, c(s,fr) (39Brown P.H. Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4651-4661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), was performed in which this scaling restriction is lifted. The r.m.s.d. from the c(s,fr) analysis was 0.006, and the peak in the c(S) distribution appears to have two components having molecular masses of ∼12 and 16 kDa (Fig. 4b). These data show that the death domains of Pelle and dMyD88 do not interact.FIGURE 4Sedimentation velocity profiles of solution containing a mixture of the Pelle and dMyD88 death domains. Data analysis with a c(S) distribution yields a sedimentation coefficient of 1.41 (a) and molecular mass from a c(M) analysis of 16 kDa. The c(s,fr) analysis (b) indicates two components having molecular masses of ∼12 and 16 kDa corresponding to the death domains of Pelle (P) and dMyD88, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pelle-Tube-dMyD88 Heterotrimer Displays a Kidney-shaped Conformation—The structures adopted by the Tube-dMyD88 DD complex or the heterotrimeric Pelle-Tube-dMyD88 DD complexes are not known. Regarding the Tube-dMyD88 DD interaction, it has been shown that two mutations, K87E and R126E, in the Tube DD prevent formation of the Tube-dMyD88 DD complex (14Sun H. Towb P. Chiem D.N. Foster B.A. Wasserman S.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although these residues are on a surface that is opposite to the sites of interaction between the Pelle-Tube DD (P1:T1) there are no structural data to exclude the possibility that in the heterotrimeric Pelle-Tube-dMyD88 DD complex dMyD88 binds in a manner that bridges the Pelle-Tube DD. Information about the shapes adopted by the heterodimeric dMyD88-Tube and the heterotrimeric Pelle-Tube-dMyD88 DD complexes was obtained from small angle scattering data collected over a wide angular range (Fig. 5, a and b). The value for Rg, an indicator of molecular compactness, for the Tube-dMyD88 complex is 2.68 ± 0.01 and 3.12 ± 0.01 nm for the Pelle-Tube-dMyD88 trimer. For comparison, the theoretical Rg value for the Pelle-Tube DD complex, based on its crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1D2Z), is 2.1 nm. Because Tube (20.5 kDa) is the common component of the Pelle-Tube and Tube-dMyD88 complexes, the larger Rg value of the Tube-dMyD"
https://openalex.org/W1974020538,"The bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae is a major cause of lung infections and is also associated with arteriosclerosis, heart disease and stroke. Work with this pathogen has been hampered by the lack of genetic tools, which among other things has made it difficult to identify virulence factors. Jin Huang et al. by-passed this problem by expressing five suspected C. pneumoniae virulence proteins in yeast cells. One of these proteins, known as CopN, interfered with cell division when expressed in yeast and mammalian cells. Then two compounds were found that reversed the cell division effect, and protected mammalian cells form infection by C. pneumoniae. This 'functional knockout' strategy offers an alternative to the direct genetic approach for use in deciphering the function of other Chlamydia proteins in disease. Bacterial virulence determinants can be identified, according to the molecular Koch's postulates1, if inactivation of a gene associated with a suspected virulence trait results in a loss in pathogenicity. This approach is commonly used with genetically tractable organisms. However, the current lack of tools for targeted gene disruptions in obligate intracellular microbial pathogens seriously hampers the identification of their virulence factors. Here we demonstrate an approach to studying potential virulence factors of genetically intractable organisms, such as Chlamydia. Heterologous expression of Chlamydia pneumoniae CopN in yeast and mammalian cells resulted in a cell cycle arrest, presumably owing to alterations in the microtubule cytoskeleton. A screen of a small molecule library identified two compounds that alleviated CopN-induced growth inhibition in yeast. These compounds interfered with C. pneumoniae replication in mammalian cells, presumably by ‘knocking out’ CopN function, revealing an essential role of CopN in the support of C. pneumoniae growth during infection. This work demonstrates the role of a specific chlamydial protein in virulence. The chemical biology approach described here can be used to identify virulence factors, and the reverse chemical genetic strategy can result in the identification of lead compounds for the development of novel therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2076745587,"Here we present new evidence that riboflavin is present as one of four flavins in Na+-NQR. In particular, we present conclusive evidence that the source of the neutral radical is not one of the FMNs and that riboflavin is the center that gives rise to the neutral flavosemiquinone. The riboflavin is a bona fide redox cofactor and is likely to be the last redox carrier of the enzyme, from which electrons are donated to quinone. We have constructed a double mutant that lacks both covalently bound FMN cofactors (NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y) and have studied this mutant together with the two single mutants (NqrB-T236Y and NqrC-T225Y) and a mutant that lacks the noncovalently bound FAD in NqrF (NqrF-S246A). The double mutant contains riboflavin and FAD in a 0.6:1 ratio, as the only flavins in the enzyme; noncovalently bound flavins were detected. In the oxidized form, the double mutant exhibits an EPR signal consistent with a neutral flavosemiquinone radical, which is abolished on reduction of the enzyme. The same radical can be observed in the FAD deletion mutant. Furthermore, when the oxidized enzyme reacts with ubiquinol (the reduced form of the usual electron acceptor) in a process that reverses the physiological direction of the electron flow, a single kinetic phase is observed. The kinetic difference spectrum of this process is consistent with one-electron reduction of a neutral flavosemiquinone. The presence of riboflavin in the role of a redox cofactor is thus far unique to Na+-NQR. Here we present new evidence that riboflavin is present as one of four flavins in Na+-NQR.

The Na+-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) 2The abbreviations used are: Na+-NQR, sodium-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: Na+-NQR, sodium-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is a primary sodium pump, found only in prokaryotes, that couples electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone to the transport of sodium ions across the membrane (1Fadeeva M.S.

The Na+-NQR complex is made up of six subunits and includes a total of 24 transmembrane helices (7Duffy E.B. Barquera B. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8343-8351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several important functional sites have been localized in the sequence of the enzyme. The electron donor, NADH, binds at conserved motif in the cytosolic domain of the NqrF subunit (8Rich P.R. Meunier B. Ward F.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This subunit also includes attachment sites for a noncovalently bound FAD cofactor and a 2Fe-2S center (8Rich P.R. Meunier B. Ward F.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Barquera B. Nilges M.J. Morgan J.E. Ramirez-Silva L. Zhou W. Gennis R.B.

In each case the binding site is a conserved S(T)GAT motif, where FMN is attached to the final threonine by a phosphoester bond (11Hayashi M. Nakayama Y. Yasui M. Maeda M. Furuishi K. Unemoto T.

The enzyme must also include a site where the electron acceptor quinone binds, but its location has not been defined.We have previously reported that in addition to these cofactors, Na+-NQR contains a noncovalently bound riboflavin (14Barquera B. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10322-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). When flavins occur as enzyme cofactors, they are usually found as FAD or FMN rather than the bare riboflavin (15Masey V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 16Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, careful biochemical analysis showed that preparations of Na+-NQR consistently contained approximately one molecule of riboflavin, which was not a degradation product of FAD or FMN. This was the first time that riboflavin was implicated as an enzyme cofactor. This finding has received some experimental corroboration. Recently, Tao et al. (17Tao M. Casutt M.S. Fritz G. Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have reported finding riboflavin in the intact wild type enzyme and also in a subcomplex containing only the B and C subunits of Na+-NQR. However, this paper did not address the questions of the assignment of any of the spectroscopic signals observed or the catalytic role of riboflavin in Na+-NQR.The conclusion that riboflavin is a bona fide component of Na+-NQR has not been universally accepted, and as recently as 2008, Na+-NQR was described as containing only three flavin molecules (18Fadeeva M.S. Bertsova Y.V. Verkhovsky M.I. Bogachev A.V. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2008; 73: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To understand the role played in Na+-NQR by flavins in general and riboflavin specifically, we began a study whose goal was to determine which cofactor gives rise to each of the well defined spectroscopic signals in Na+-NQR. The enzyme exhibits a number of different flavin EPR signals, depending on the overall redox state of the enzyme (17Tao M. Casutt M.S. Fritz G. Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Barquera B. Morgan J.E. Lukoyanov D. Scholes C.P. Gennis R.B. Nilges M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A neutral flavin radical is present in the oxidized (as isolated) form of the enzyme. Two different anionic flavosemiquinone radical signals are detected at different levels of reduction. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and EPR spectroscopy, we have attempted to determine which flavin or flavins in the enzyme give rise to each of the three observed radical signals. According to our analysis, the anionic radicals are formed by the FMN molecules attached to subunits B and C. The neutral radical was observed in the oxidized form of the wild type enzyme, as well as in mutants where the FAD and each of the FMN cofactors were individually deleted. This indicated, by elimination, that the neutral flavosemiquinone radical arises from the riboflavin cofactor in Na+-NQR (20Barquera B. Ramirez-Silva L. Morgan J.E. Nilges M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36482-36491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This contradicts earlier work suggesting that the source of the neutral radical was one of the two FMN molecules (21Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Bloch D.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3421-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).However, the results from single flavin deletion mutants are not completely conclusive. For example it is possible that one or both of the FMN cofactors could be a neutral flavosemiquinone in the oxidized form of the enzyme and then deprotonate to become an anionic flavosemiquinone when the remaining redox centers of the enzyme become reduced. It is also possible that deletion of one FMN cofactor alters the redox or spectroscopic properties of the other FMN.To eliminate these possibilities, we have now constructed a double mutant, NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y, in which both of the covalently bound FMNs have been removed. Here, we show that the double mutant contains riboflavin. This is further evidence that riboflavin is a bona fide cofactor of Na+-NQR and not a product of degradation of other cofactors. The double mutant exhibits the neutral flavosemiquinone EPR signal, but neither of the anionic radicals is observed. The presence of only the neutral flavosemiquinone EPR signal indicates that this radical is not derived from either FMN cofactor. We also studied the NqrF-S246A mutant, which lacks the FAD cofactor. This mutant also exhibited a neutral flavosemiquinone EPR signal that is spectroscopically identical to the ones obtained from the double mutant and the wild type enzyme.Given this assignment of the neutral radical to the riboflavin cofactor, we have begun to define the role of riboflavin in the redox reactions of the enzyme. It has previously been shown that the neutral flavosemiquinone participates in the electron transfer pathway of Na+-NQR from Vibrio harveyi (21Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Bloch D.A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3421-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, we have characterized a reaction in which the oxidized enzyme is reduced by ubiquinol, the reduced form of the usual electron acceptor. In this “reverse reduction” reaction the disappearance of the neutral flavosemiquinone can be observed as the only significant kinetic process. This demonstrates that the riboflavin is a true redox cofactor of the enzyme and suggests that it may be located close to the electron output site in the sequence of redox carriers in Na+-NQR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Growth Conditions—V. cholerae cells, expressing the recombinant Na+-NQR wild type or mutants, were grown at 37 °C in LB medium in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with constant agitation of 200 rpm. Expression of the nqr operon was achieved by the addition of arabinose to the culture medium during the log phase of growth. The cells were grown in two 30-liter (working volume) fermenters (BioFlo-5000; New Brunswick Scientific) with a constant agitation of 300 rpm. The cells were harvested by continuous flow centrifugation (Cepa Z41; New Brunswick Scientific), washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), and broken in a Microfluidizer as reported earlier (3Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Hase C.C. Gosink K.K. Nilges M. Bruesehoff P.J. Roth A. Lancaster C.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3781-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The inner membranes were obtained by ultracentrifugation of the broken cells at 100,000 × g. The membrane pellet was washed with 50 mm NaPi, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol and frozen in aliquots at –80 °C until needed.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The single mutants NqrB-T236Y, NqrC-T225Y, and NqrF-S246A were constructed previously, as described in Ref. 20Barquera B. Ramirez-Silva L. Morgan J.E. Nilges M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36482-36491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar. The double mutant, NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y was constructed using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA from the existing pBAD-nqr-B-T236Y, which includes the entire nqr operon, was used as a template for the NqrC-T225Y mutagenesis reaction to create the double mutant. The primers used for this reaction were the ones used previously to construct the NqrC-T225Y single mutant (20Barquera B. Ramirez-Silva L. Morgan J.E. Nilges M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36482-36491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The double mutant was checked by restriction digestion analysis and DNA sequencing. The plasmid containing the double mutant was transformed in a strain of V. cholerae that lacks of the entire nqr operon (7Duffy E.B. Barquera B. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8343-8351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The expression of the double mutant NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y was tested by Western blotting using anti-His6 tag antibodies (Invitrogen).Protein Purification and Other Analytical Methods—Na+-NQR wild type and mutants were purified using the protocol reported previously (3Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Hase C.C. Gosink K.K. Nilges M. Bruesehoff P.J. Roth A. Lancaster C.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3781-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After the affinity chromatography step, the double mutant protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column) using “Tris buffer” (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-maltoside, 5% (v/v) glycerol). The aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen until needed. Protein concentration was determined using the bicichonic acid method (Pierce).Protein was denatured by the addition of 6 m guanidine-hydrochloride, pH 7, or 2% SDS (w/v), 6 m urea. The denatured samples were analyzed by visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. UV-visible spectra were recorded in a diode-array spectrophotometer (Agilent). Fluorescence spectra of the denatured protein were recorded in Horiba-Jobin-Yvon Flurolog Tau3 fluorimeter. After denaturation, the mixture of protein and soluble cofactors was separated using centrifugal Amicon filters (3-kDa cut-off), (Millipore), and the supernatant was analyzed by visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. The flavins present in this supernatant were further analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu) following the method reported in Ref. 14Barquera B. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10322-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, using a C18 5X column.Preparation of Ubiquinol—Ubiquinol-1 was prepared from ubiquinone-1 by the method of Trumpower and Edwards (22Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using dithionite and sodium borohydrate as reductants.Stopped Flow Measurements—Reduction of the oxidized enzyme by ubiquinol was carried out using an Applied Photophysics Sx.18MV-R stopped flow spectrophotometer equipped with a PD.1 diode array capable of acquiring from 185 to 715.5 nm (diode separation of 2.17 nm) at a rate of up to one full-spectrum every 1.28 ms. The enzyme was first transferred to low sodium Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.05% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-maltoside, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol) using centrifugal concentrators and then incubated with Escherichia coli phospholipids (E. coli total lipid extract; Avanti Lipids) (0.25 mg/mg of protein) on ice for 10 min. The ubiquinol-1 solution was prepared in Tris buffer with 200 mm NaCl and 4 mm dithionite to prevent air oxidation of ubiquinol-1. The enzyme and reductant were each loaded into one of the two syringes of the stopped flow system and allowed to equilibrate to the working temperature (4 °C) prior to mixing. The over-sampling function of the instrument was used to reduce noise. To obtain a good signal to noise ratio, each measurement was repeated 12–15 times, and the experiment was repeated with three different batches of enzyme.Data Analysis—Data matrices from replicate acquisitions were averaged using MATLAB (The Mathworks). The averaged matrices were analyzed using Applied Photophysics PC Pro-K software for global analysis of multiwavelength kinetic data.EPR Experiments—Reduced samples for EPR analysis were prepared using a vacuum line. The samples were reduced with NADH or dithionite in anaerobic conditions. X-band EPR spectra were collected on a Varian E-122 spectrometer. The samples were run as frozen glasses at ∼60 K using an Air Products Helitran cryostat with liquid helium.RESULTSEffect of the Double Mutation NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y on the Cofactor Composition of Na+-NQR—These two mutations eliminate the ligands for the FMN cofactors in subunits NqrB and NqrC. The resulting protein contains only soluble flavins and the 2Fe-2S center. In the case of NqrB, the change from threonine to tyrosine was the only viable mutation found; other amino acids yielded a poorly assembled protein. Bacteria carrying the double mutant were able to grow and express the full Na+-NQR complex, but the yield of pure protein was only ∼10–20% of the yield for the recombinant wild type.Attempts to Delete Three of the Four Flavins in Na+-NQR—We tried to obtain an enzyme with riboflavin as the only flavin cofactor by constructing a triple mutant, NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y/NqrF-S246A. Unfortunately, it proved to be impossible to obtain useful amounts of the mutant protein. The cells carrying the mutant plasmid grew extremely poorly, and the quantities of enzyme in the cell were very low, making it difficult to obtain a pure preparation.Fluorescence Spectra of the Denatured NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y Double Mutant—To confirm that the presence of riboflavin in Na+-NQR is not the result of the degradation of the other flavins in the enzyme, (i.e. degradation of the covalently bound flavins in NqrB or in NqrC or the noncovalently bound FAD in NqrF), we analyzed the flavin content of a double mutant, which lacks the two covalently bound flavins. This mutant should only have the two noncovalently bound flavins: FAD and riboflavin. To this end, the protein was denatured using guanidine or SDS/urea, and the soluble components were separated using a centrifugal concentrator with a molecular mass cut-off of 3 kDa. The denatured protein and the supernatant were analyzed by visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows two fluorescence emission spectra: one corresponding to the total content of flavins in the denatured sample and the other corresponding to the spectrum of the supernatant after filtration, which corresponds to the soluble flavins in the enzyme. The two spectra are close to identical, indicating that this mutant contains only soluble flavins. The protein/flavin ratio is 1:1.6, suggesting that there are two flavin molecules in the protein.HPLC Identification of the Soluble Flavins in the Double Mutant NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y and in NqrF-S246A Mutant—To identify the nature of the soluble flavins in the denatured double mutant protein, the supernatant obtained after denaturation was injected in a C-18 column and separated by HPLC. Flavin standards were run to localize the retention time for FAD, FMN, and riboflavin as reported before (14Barquera B. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10322-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As in the wild type enzyme, the HPLC profile presents two peaks, the first corresponding to FAD and the second corresponding to riboflavin. The ratio between FAD:riboflavin in the double mutant is 1:0.6. (Fig. 2). The ratio in the wild type enzyme is 1:0.8. Similar ratios were obtained for samples denatured with either guanidine or urea/SDS. These results clearly show that riboflavin is still present in the enzyme even in the absence of the two covalently bound flavins. The lower FAD:riboflavin ratio of in the double mutant, is probably due to the loss of the smaller riboflavin cofactor during enzyme isolation and suggests that the mutant may structurally less stable than the wild type enzyme. We also used HPLC to analyze the flavin content of the NqrF-S246A mutant, which lacks the noncovalently bound FAD in subunit F. Unlike the double mutant, this enzyme contains the two covalently bound FMNs in NqrB and NqrC, but these will be removed from the sample by the filtration step, leaving only the soluble flavins. The HPLC profile of this mutant shows only one peak with a retention time corresponding to riboflavin (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2HPLC elution profile of the low molecular supernatant after denaturation of the double mutant NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y and the NqrF-S246A mutant. Sample detection was performed at 450 nm at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. The peaks corresponding to FAD and riboflavin are marked with arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EPR Characterization of the Double Mutant NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y and the NqrF-S246A Mutant—Previously, we used EPR to study mutants that eliminate each of the three flavins of known location in Na+-NQR: the two covalently bound FMNs in NqrB and NqrC and the noncovalently bound FAD in NqrF (9Barquera B. Nilges M.J. Morgan J.E. Ramirez-Silva L. Zhou W. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12322-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Barquera B. Ramirez-Silva L. Morgan J.E. Nilges M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36482-36491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The wild type enzyme, in its oxidized form (as prepared), exhibits a neutral flavosemiquinone radical. Upon reduction, two different anionic flavosemiquinone radicals can be observed depending on the level of reduction. By studying these mutants, the two anionic radicals were assigned to the FMN in NqrB and NqrC. The mutant that lacks the FAD showed all of the EPR signals observed in the wild type enzyme. Furthermore, the neutral radical was observed in the oxidized form of all of the mutants, indicating that this signal does not arise from the FAD or either of the FMNs. Based on these results, we suggested that riboflavin is the site of the neutral radical in Na+-NQR (20Barquera B. Ramirez-Silva L. Morgan J.E. Nilges M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36482-36491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).To confirm this result, we have now analyzed the double mutant, NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y by EPR in its oxidized, partially reduced, and fully reduced forms. If our previous conclusion is correct, the only flavin radical observed in this mutant should be a neutral radical in the oxidized form of the enzyme, and this signal should disappear upon reduction, with no appearance of the anionic radicals. Fig. 3A shows the EPR spectra of the double mutant in the oxidized, partially reduced and fully reduced forms. The oxidized spectrum shows a signal from a flavosemiquinone with a line width of 20 G (2 millitesla), typical of a neutral flavosemiquinone radical (19Barquera B. Morgan J.E. Lukoyanov D. Scholes C.P. Gennis R.B. Nilges M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Kay C.w.M. feicht R. Schulz K. Sadewater P. Sancar A. Bacher A. Mobius K. Richter G. Weber S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16740-16748Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This signal gains intensity upon partial reduction, but the line width does not change, indicating that in the mutant the neutral radical is partially oxidized, and after the addition of relative small amount of NADH, this form goes back to the one-electron reduced form. This is consistent with the behavior of the NqrB-T236Y single mutant. After the addition of an excess of reductant (dithionite), the neutral flavosemiquinone radical signal disappears completely, and the only signal observed is that of the 2Fe-2S center. Fig. 3B shows the double derivative spectra of oxidized forms of the double mutant and the wild type enzyme, showing that the neutral flavosemiquinone radicals in these two enzymes are essentially identical. As a further test, we carried out a more detailed analysis by EPR of the NqrF-S246A mutant, in which the binding site for FAD has been eliminated. EPR spectra of the oxidized form of this mutant enzyme show the neutral radical signal (20-G, 2-millitesla line width) (Fig. 3C). Upon addition of excess reductant, this signal is completely abolished, and an anionic semiquinone radical appears (15-G, 1.5-millitesla line width). These data confirm that riboflavin is the only possible candidate for the neutral radical in the enzyme.FIGURE 3A, X-band EPR spectra of the oxidized, partially reduced (0.5 mm NADH) and fully reduced (60 mm dithionite) double mutant NqrB-T236Y/NqrC-T225Y; and X-band EPR spectra of the oxidized, partially reduced (1 mm dithionite) and fully reduced (60 mm dithionite) mutant NqrF-S246A.

This contrasts with our previous observation that the neutral radical was in near stoichiometric amount in the wild type enzyme. This may be the result, in part, of the lower concentration of riboflavin in these mutants but also a change in the redox equilibrium of the neutral radical as indicated by the observation that the amplitude of the neutral radical increased in the double mutant upon partial reduction (Fig. 3A). This could result from a change in the redox potential of the neutral radical itself or due to removal of the FMN in NqrB. This would suggest a strong coupling between this FMN and the neutral radical.Reduction of the Riboflavin Cofactor in Na+-NQR by Ubiquinol—So far, we have shown that riboflavin is present in Na+-NQR and is the flavin responsible for forming the neutral radical. With this assignment, we can begin to investigate the role of riboflavin in the mechanism of the enzyme. Bogachev et al. (21Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Bloch D.A. Verkhovsky M.I.

This indicates that riboflavin plays a role in the redox mechanism of Na+-NQR. To investigate this further, we studied reduction of the enzyme from the opposite direction, reacting the oxidized enzyme with ubiquinol, an analog of the usual electron acceptor, in its reduced form. This reaction should reduce the enzyme by injecting electrons into to the normal electron exit site.The reaction was carried out by mixing the fully oxidized enzyme with ubiquinol in a stopped flow system. In the wild type enzyme one major kinetic phase is observed. The difference spectrum of this process was obtained from a single-exponential global fit to the data, as shown in Fig. 4A. This spectrum is consistent with one-electron reduction of a neutral flavosemiquinone to the fully reduced form. The time course of the reaction at 575 nm is shown in Fig. 4B. This confirms the participation of riboflavin as a bona fide redox cofactor in Na+-NQR. It also suggests that riboflavin is the final redox carrier in Na+-NQR before electrons are donated to ubiquinone but that in the reverse reaction, reduction of the enzyme by ubiquinol provides only sufficient driving force to reduce this one redox carrier. However, this does not definitively establish riboflavin as the final carrier. The end point of the reaction is governed by equilibria rather than kinetics, and these results do not rule out the possibility of an intervening low potential carrier.

The human indigenous bacterium H. pylori diverged along with humans, into African, European, Asian and Amerindian groups. Of these, Amerindians have the least genetic diversity. Since niche diversity widens the sets of resources for colonizing species, we predicted that the Amerindian H. pylori strains would be the least diverse. We analyzed the multilocus sequence (7 housekeeping genes) of 131 strains: 19 cultured from Africans, 36 from Spanish, 11 from Koreans, 43 from Amerindians and 22 from South American Mestizos. We found that all strains that had been cultured from Africans were African strains (hpAfrica1), all from Spanish were European (hpEurope) and all from Koreans were hspEAsia but that Amerindians and Mestizos carried mixed strains: hspAmerind and hpEurope strains had been cultured from Amerindians and hpEurope and hpAfrica1 were cultured from Mestizos. The least genetically diverse H. pylori strains were hspAmerind. Strains hpEurope were the most diverse and showed remarkable multilocus sequence mosaicism (indicating recombination). The lower genetic structure in hpEurope strains is consistent with colonization of a diversity of hosts. If diversity is important for the success of H. pylori, then the low diversity of Amerindian strains might be linked to their apparent tendency to disappear. This suggests that Amerindian strains may lack the needed diversity to survive the diversity brought by non-Amerindian hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2053144779,"MAPKs are key components of cell signaling pathways with a unique activation mechanism: i.e. dual phosphorylation of neighboring threonine and tyrosine residues. The ERK enzymes form a subfamily of MAPKs involved in proliferation, differentiation, development, learning, and memory. The exact role of each Erk molecule in these processes is not clear. An efficient strategy for addressing this question is to activate individually each molecule, for example, by expressing intrinsically active variants of them. However, such molecules were not produced so far. Here, we report on the isolation, via a specifically designed genetic screen, of six variants (each carries a point mutation) of the yeast MAPK Mpk1/Erk that are active, independent of upstream phosphorylation. One of the activating mutations, R68S, occurred in a residue conserved in the mammalian Erk1 (Arg-84) and Erk2 (Arg-65) and in the Drosophila ERK Rolled (Arg-80). Replacing this conserved Arg with Ser rendered these MAPKs intrinsically active to very high levels when tested in vitro as recombinant proteins. Combination of the Arg to Ser mutation with the sevenmaker mutation (producing Erk2R65S+D319N and RolledR80S+D334N) resulted in even higher activity (45 and 70%, respectively, in reference to fully active dually phosphorylated Erk2 or Rolled). Erk2R65S and Erk2R65S+D319N were found to be spontaneously active also when expressed in human HEK293 cells.

They are highly conserved throughout evolution in all eukaryotes in both sequence and mechanism of activation. MAPKs are classified to subfamilies based on degree of homology, biological responses, and phosphorylation motif (1.Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Mammalian subfamilies include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs), and the p38s (2.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol.

Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). In cells not exposed to stimulation, the catalytic activity of MAPKs is kept off very efficiently. Exposure of cells to a given stimulus induces the relevant MAPK pathways, each composed of three kinases (MAPKKK, MAPKK, and a MAPK) that phosphorylate and activate one another in a hierarchical way (2.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar, 4.Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr.

Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). MAPKs are unique with respect to phosphorylation-mediated activation because their activation requires dual phosphorylation of both a threonine residue and a neighboring tyrosine residue (a TXY motif) in their activation loop (24.Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25.Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H.

Since many MAPK families are concomitantly activated, it is difficult to dissect the biochemical and biological role of each family and of each component within a family. An efficient strategy for following the exact function of each component is to activate it in the cell when all other components are not activated. This could be done by expressing intrinsically active variants of the molecules in question. Production of intrinsically active MAPKKKs or MAPKKs is relatively straightforward and was successfully executed by replacing the Thr/Ser phosphoacceptors with Glu or Asp (27.Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 28.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). This strategy is not useful for MAPKs because no amino acid can accurately mimic Tyr phosphorylation. Also, attempts to mimic phosphorylation by replacing the relevant Thr to Glu were not successful (25.Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Bell M. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14603-14606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A large number of studies applying other strategies were also just partially successful (30.Askari N. Diskin R. Avitzour M. Yaakov G. Livnah O. Engelberg D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 252: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Several years ago, we took a genetic approach for isolation of intrinsically active mutants of the yeast MAPK Hog1. The essence of the approach was screening for Hog1 molecules that are biologically active in the absence of their MAPKK (for details on the rationale and techniques of the screens, see Ref. 31.Engelberg D. Livnah O. Methods (Amst.). 2006; 40: 255-261Google Scholar). Not only was the screen most successful and provided intrinsically active Hog1 variants (32.Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the activating mutations occurred in residues conserved in mammalian MAPKs and directly led to the production of intrinsically active variants of all members of the human p38 family (33.Askari N.

Hitherto, intrinsically active mutants were not available for this important family of kinases. Only mutations that slightly increase or just prolong the activity of Erk were so far isolated (30.Askari N. Diskin R. Avitzour M. Yaakov G. Livnah O. Engelberg D. Mol. Cell.

However, it is not known whether Erks are mutated in these cases. Despite the strong correlation between the activity of Erks and the various pathologies, the exact role of Erks in these diseases is not clear. This role could be specifically studied with intrinsically active variants of Erks.In this study, we describe our attempts to produce active variants of Erks. First, we inserted into ERK2 mutations identical to those that rendered Hog1 and p38 active. Mutations were inserted alone or in combinations, but intrinsic activity obtained was low. We, therefore, designed and implemented a genetic screen in yeast, aimed at isolation of intrinsically active (MEK-independent) Erks. The screen is analogous to the previous screen that led to the isolation of Hog1 mutants (32.Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) but was applied on the yeast MPK1/ERK pathway (1.Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). The screen provided six different point mutations in Mpk1, each of them sufficient to render Mpk1 catalytically and biologically active, independent of upstream regulation.Insertion of equivalent mutations to Erk1 and Erk2 revealed that one mutation (R84S in Erk1; R65S in Erk2) rendered these enzymes intrinsically active as measured in vitro. Unexpectedly, combination of the R65S mutation with the sevenmaker mutation (D319N) rendered Erk2 even more active in vitro. Intrinsic activity of Erk2R65S+D319N was about 45% of MEK1-activated Erk2WT. We further revealed the mechanism of action of the mutants and show that they acquire an efficient autophosphorylation activity on both the Thr and the Tyr residues of the phosphorylation lip. We also show that a similar mutation renders the Drosophila MAPK Rolled intrinsically active. Finally, we report that spontaneous phosphorylations and activities of Erk1R84S, Erk2R65S, and Erk2R65+D319N were also measured following transient expression of these mutants in HEK293T cells. Thus, a first series of mutants of the ERK family, including ERKs of yeast, flies, and mammals, that are spontaneously active in vitro and in vivo has been developed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Media—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study were: mkk1Δ/mkk2Δ (BY4741; Mat a; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; YPL140c::kanMX4; mkk1::LEU2; this study) and mpk1Δ (BY4741; Mat a; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; YHR030c::kanMX4; obtained from Euroscarf). Yeast cultures were maintained on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto Peptone, 2% glucose + 15 mm caffeine, where indicated) or on the synthetic medium YNB-URA (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and NH4(SO4)2, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and 40 mg/liter adenine, histidine, tryptophan, lysine, leucine, and methionine).Random Mutagenesis Procedures—The library of MPK1 mutants was produced in the bacterial strain LE30 according to (54.Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments With Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 75-78Google Scholar). A pAES426-HA-MPK1 plasmid, carrying the MPK1 and URA3 genes, was introduced into LE30 cells. About 50,000 colonies were obtained and allowed to grow on LB + ampicillin plates for 24 h. All colonies were collected in a pool into 1 liter of LB medium (containing ampicillin) and further grown for 12 h. Then, the culture was diluted 1:5 and further grown for 15 h prior to plasmid preparation. (For more information, see Ref. 31.Engelberg D. Livnah O. Methods (Amst.). 2006; 40: 255-261Google Scholar.)Site-directed mutagenesis was performed for some mutations via polymerase chain reaction and for others via the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The sequences of the primers used for mutagenesis are listed in Table 1. All mutated cDNAs were verified via DNA sequencing of the entire ERK1 or ERK2 cDNAs.TABLE 1Sequences of primers used in polymerase chain reaction and site-directed mutagenesis reactionsPrimer namePrimer sequenceERK1-F-R84S5′-gaa cat cag acc tac tgc cag agc acg ctc cg-3′ERK1-R-R84S5′-cgg agc gtg ctc tgg cag tag gtc tga tgt tc-3′ERK1-F-S139A5′-gaa aag cca gca gct ggc caa tga cca tat ctg c-3′ERK1-R-S139A5′-gca gat atg gtc att ggc cag ctg ctg gct ttt c-3′ERK1-F-Y222C5′-gaa ctc caa ggg ctg tac caa gtc cat cg-3′ERK1-R-Y222C5′-cga tgg act tgg tac agc cct tgg agt tc-3′ERK1-F-Y280C5′-cat gaa ggc ccg aaa ctg cct aca gtc tc-3′ERK1-R-Y280C5′-gag act gta ggc agt ttc ggg cct tca tg-3′ERK2-F-R65S5′-cag acc tac tgt cag agt acc ctg aga gag-3′ERK2-R-R65S5′-ctc tct cag ggt act ctg aca gta ggt ctg-3′ERK2-F-S120A5′-gct ctt gaa gac aca gca cct cgc caa tga tca tat ctg c-3′ERK2-R-S120A5′-gca gat atg atc att ggc gag gtg ctg tgt ctt caa gag c-3′ERK2-F-Y203C5′-gaa ttc caa ggg ttg tac caa gtc cat tga tat ttg g-3′ERK2-R-Y203C5′-cca aat atc aat gga ctt ggt aca acc ctt gga att c-3′ERK2-F-Y261C5′-gct aga aac tgt ttg ctt tct ctc ccg cac-3′ERK2-R-Y261C5′-gtg cgg gag aga aag caa aca gtt tct agc-3′ERK2-F-D319N5′-gca gta tta tga ccc aag taa tga gcc cat tgc tga agc-3′ERK2-R-D319N5′-gct tca gca atg ggc tca tta ctt ggg tca taa tac tgc-3′Rolled-F-R80S5′-cca aac tta ttg tca aag cac tct cag aga aat aac c-3′Rolled-R-R80S5′-ggt tat ttc tct gag agt gct ttg aca ata agt ttg g-3′Rolled-F-D334N5′-gca ata tta tga tcc tgg aaa tga gcc tgt cgc tg-3′Rolled-R-D334N5′-cag cga cag gct cat ttc cag gat cat aat att gc-3′ Open table in a new tab Screening of the MPK1 Mutant Library—Transformation of the library of MPK1 mutants into mkk1Δmkk2Δ yeast cells was performed as described by Schiestl and Gietz (55.Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were plated on selective YNB-URA plates. Colonies that grew (about 10,000/100-mm plate) were replicaplated onto YPD plates containing different concentrations of caffeine (12 and 15 mm). Plasmid loss assay, for positive colonies, was performed by streaking patches of positive colonies on YPD plates, allowing the colonies to grow for 24 h, and isolating single colonies. These single colonies were replica-plated onto YNB-URA plates as well as onto caffeine-containing YPD plates.Only cultures that gave rise to colonies that showed an absolute linkage between growth on YNB-URA plates and growth on caffeine plates were further used for extraction of plasmids. Isolated plasmids were introduced into naive mkk1Δ/mkk2Δ cells. Plasmids that were found positive in this test were sequenced.Protein Expression and Purification—Wild-type and mutant forms of ERKs were expressed in Escherichia coli cells as described earlier (56.Wang Z. Harkins P.C. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Each expression plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3)-pLysS cells (Invitrogen). Cell cultures were grown in volumes of 0.5 liters at 30 °C until they reached an A600 of 0.3–0.4. Protein expression was induced using 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation after 5 h of induction. Cells were washed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.3 m NaCl, centrifuged again, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. The frozen pellet was gently thawed on ice and suspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm imidazole, 0.3 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After mechanical disruption of the cells using a Microfluidizer (model M-110 EHIS, Microrofluidics Corp., Newton, MA) at ∼70% strength, the lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the soluble protein was loaded on a 1.6-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose bead (Adar Biotech) gravity flow open column. The Erk1 and Erk2 proteins were washed using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 30 mm imidazole, 0.3 mm NaCl and eluted from the column using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.3 m NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. The protein solution was then dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. After dialysis, protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay, and the purified protein was then divided into aliquots, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in –80 °C.Paper-spotted Kinase Assay—Reactions were carried out in 96-well plates with conical bottoms. 0.2 μg of purified recombinant hexahistidine tag-Erks mutant and wild-type proteins were used in a final volume of 50 μl/well. The kinase assays were initialized by the addition of 45 μl of reaction mixture to 5 μl of ERK enzyme. Final reaction conditions were 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm 2-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/μl myelin basic protein (MBP), 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reactions proceeded for 15 min at 30 °C and were terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8 (250 mm final) and placement on ice. Following reaction termination, aliquots of 85 μl from each well were spotted onto 3 × 3-cm Whatman No. 3MM paper squares and briefly air-dried. Each square was rinsed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid and 3% sodium pyrophosphate (10 ml/square) for 1.5 h (each time) with gentle agitation, and a fourth wash for overnight was given without shaking. The following day, the squares were rinsed twice with 100% ethanol (4 ml/square) for 20 min each time and air-dried. The radioactivity of each square was counted using a scintillation counter running a 32P Cherenkov program. Experimental points were usually triplicates. In addition, Laemmli sample buffer was added to 12 μl from each reaction. All samples were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min and were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was exposed to film.To activate the recombinant Erk variants, 1 μg of a purified recombinant hexahistidine-tagged Erk protein and 10 ng of recombinant active MEK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, 14-429) were used. Final reaction conditions were 100 mm NaCl, 35 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-glycerolphosphate, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.02 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 100 μm ATP. The activation reactions proceeded for 30 min at 30 °C and were terminated by placement on ice.Western Blotting—100 ng of recombinant proteins or 30 μg of protein lysates from mammalian cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After incubation of the membrane with the appropriate antibodies (Table 2), specific proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent.TABLE 2Antibodies that were used in this studyAntibody nameOriginDilutionManufacturerAnti-phospho-ERKMouse1:2,000Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC7383)Anti-ERKRabbit1:1,000Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC154)Anti-phospho-ThrMouse1:3,000Cell Signaling (9386S)Anti-phospho-TyrMouse1:100Millipore (4G10)Anti-HA (for Western blot)Mouse1:1000Santa Cruz Biotechnology (12CA5)Anti-HA (for immunoprecipitation)GoatBethyl Laboratories (A190207A)Anti-His (for Western blot and immunoprecipitation)MouseSigma (H1029) Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Treatment—HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel) and"
https://openalex.org/W2090484393,"The shape of the Sun subtly reflects its rotation and internal flows. The surface rotation rate, ∼2 kilometers per second at the equator, predicts an oblateness (equator-pole radius difference) of 7.8 milli–arc seconds, or ∼0.001%. Observations from the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager satellite show unexpectedly large flattening, relative to the expectation from surface rotation. This excess is dominated by the quadrupole term and gives a total oblateness of 10.77 ± 0.44 milli–arc seconds. The position of the limb correlates with a sensitive extreme ultraviolet proxy, the 284 angstrom limb brightness. We relate the larger radius values to magnetic elements in the enhanced network and use the correlation to correct for it as a systematic error term in the oblateness measurement. The corrected oblateness of the nonmagnetic Sun is 8.01 ± 0.14 milli–arc seconds, which is near the value expected from rotation."
https://openalex.org/W2067473898,"Spongiform encephalopathies have been reported to be transmitted by blood transfusion even prior to the clinical onset. Experimental AA-amyloidosis shows similarities with prion disease and amyloid-containing organ-extracts can prime a recipient for the disease. In this systemic form of amyloidosis N-terminal fragments of the acute-phase reactant apolipoprotein serum amyloid A are the main amyloid protein. Initial amyloid deposits appear in the perifollicular region of the spleen, followed by deposits in the liver. We used the established murine model and induced AA-amyloidosis in NMRI mice by intravenous injections of purified amyloid fibrils ('amyloid enhancing factor') combined with inflammatory challenge (silver nitrate subcutaneously). Blood plasma and peripheral blood monocytes were isolated, sonicated and re-injected into new recipients followed by an inflammatory challenge during a three week period. When the animals were sacrificed presence of amyloid was analyzed in spleen sections after Congo red staining. Our result shows that some of the peripheral blood monocytes, isolated from animals with detectable amyloid, contained amyloid-seed that primed for AA-amyloid. The seeding material seems to have been phagocytosed by the cells since the AA-precursor (SAA1) was found not be expressed by the monocytes. Plasma recovered from mice with AA amyloidosis lacked seeding capacity. Amyloid enhancing activity can reside in monocytes recovered from mice with AA-amyloidosis and in a prion-like way trigger amyloid formation in conjunction with an inflammatory disorder. Human AA-amyloidosis resembles the murine form and every individual is expected to be exposed to conditions that initiate production of the acute-phase reactant. The monocyte-transfer mechanism should be eligible for the human disease and we point out blood transfusion as a putative route for transfer of amyloidosis."

To lay ground-work for developing peptide-based inhibitors with a useful degree of selectivity for the Mtb proteasome over those of the host, we used a library of 5,920 N-acetyl tripeptide-aminomethylcoumarins to contrast the substrate preferences of the recombinant Mtb proteasome wild type and open gate mutant, the Rhodococcus erythropolis proteasome, and the bovine proteasome with activator PA28. The Mtb proteasome was distinctive in strictly preferring P1 = tryptophan, particularly in combination with P3 = glycine, proline, lysine or arginine. Screening results were validated with Michalis-Menten kinetic analyses of 21 oligopeptide aminomethyl-coumarin substrates. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor in clinical use, and 17 analogs varying only at P1 were used to examine the differential impact of inhibitors on human and Mtb proteasomes. The results with the inhibitor panel confirmed those with the substrate panel in demonstrating differential preferences of Mtb and mammalian proteasomes at the P1 amino acid. Changing P1 in bortezomib from Leu to m-CF3-Phe led to a 220-fold increase in IC50 against the human proteasome, whereas changing a P1 Ala to m-F-Phe decreased the IC50 400-fold against the Mtb proteasome. The change of a P1 Ala to m-Cl-Phe led to an 8000-fold shift in inhibitory potency in favor of the Mtb proteasome, resulting in 8-fold selectivity.

Smith I.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). After four decades without the introduction of new anti-tuberculosis agents into the clinic, efforts are underway to find new chemophores that inhibit new targets and shorten the 6-9-month treatment regimen that makes compliance problematic (2Duncan K.

Weich N. Nathan C.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1963-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The Mtb proteasome is emerging as a potential anti-tuberculosis drug target. It defends the bacterium against host nitrosative stress (12Darwin K.H. Ehrt S. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Weich N. Nathan C.F.

Nathan C. Li H. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, for proteasome inhibition to be a viable anti-infective approach, the inhibitors must be much more active against the proteasome of the bacterium than against that of the host. Partial inhibition of host proteasomes has been successful in the treatment of certain malignancies (16Adams J. Behnke M. Chen S. Cruickshank A.A. Dick L.R. Grenier L. Klunder J.M. Ma Y.T.

Toxicity in this setting is often considered acceptable but would be highly undesirable in the treatment of an infectious disease. The extensive conservation of proteasome structure makes it challenging to find inhibitors with species selectivity. A standard approach to developing selective protease inhibitors is to attach a warhead to a selective substrate (19Powers J.C. Asgian J.L. Ekici O.D. James K.E. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4639-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Among proteasome inhibitors, peptidyl boronates exemplify this approach and have achieved clinical utility (16Adams J. Behnke M. Chen S. Cruickshank A.A. Dick L.R. Grenier L. Klunder J.M. Ma Y.T. Plamondon L. Stein R.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 17Adams J.

Haematol. 2007; 138: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, we have embarked on a program to develop peptidyl boronates with greater potency for the Mtb proteasome than for the ;5 subunit of the human proteasome, whose inhibition is chiefly responsible for the toxicity of these compounds (16Adams J. Behnke M. Chen S. Cruickshank A.A. Dick L.R. Grenier L. Klunder J.M. Ma Y.T. Plamondon L. Stein R.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 17Adams J.

As a step toward that goal, the present study sought potentially exploitable differences in the preferences of bacterial and mammalian proteasomes for tripeptide substrates. The proteasome core, here called “20S,” is a cylindrical 28-meric protein complex with proteolytic sites shielded within a central chamber (11Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar), to which access is regulated by additional subunits that bind and hydrolyze ATP. The overall structures of proteasomes among eukaryotes and prokaryotes (archaea and eubacterial Actinomycetes) share a barrel structure, with ; subunits forming two heptameric outer rings and ; subunits forming two heptameric inner rings. Proteolysis occurs at N-terminal threonines on ; subunits that are exposed by autocatalytic removal of a propeptide upon assembly (20Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes there are seven types of ; subunits and seven types of ; subunits, with only three of the ; subunits (;1, ;2, and ;5) displaying proteolytic activities. With oligopeptide substrates, these activities are caspase-like, trypsin-like, and chymotrypsin-like, respectively (21Orlowski M. Cardozo C. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1a). In contrast, prokaryotic proteasomes usually include only one or two types of ; and ; subunit, and the active sites are usually chymotrypsin-like with oligopeptide substrates. Mtb ; subunits are of a single type. Cryo-electron microscopy, x-ray crystallography, and mutation analysis suggested that the ; subunits have a gating function and confirmed that the 14 ; subunits each provide an active site N-terminal threonine OH (14Lin G.

In the present work we used a mutant form of the recombinant Mtb proteasome (Mtb20SOG) in which deletion of the N-terminal octapeptide from the ; subunits mimics the presumed “open gate” configuration and increases specific activity toward oligopeptide substrates by approximately an order of magnitude (14Lin G.

The positional scanning libraries were usually constructed as 20 pools/position (P1, P2, P3, and P4), each of which contained large numbers of peptides fixed at a single residue and otherwise variant. These studies provided a global analysis of substrate preference at defined positions in the peptide adjacent to the cleavage site (P1) and more distally (P2, P3, and P4) and served well for identification of selective inhibitors for different ; subunits (25Groll M. Nazif T. Huber R. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, using positional scanning libraries of substrates or inhibitors is likely to miss the interactions among amino acids at different positions. It is also likely to be more challenging to identify differences in substrate preference between two highly homologous ; subunits from different species that are both predominantly chymotryptic. To discern potentially subtle differences in substrate preferences, we needed to take into account the influence of the amino acid at each position on the preferences at each other position. We approached this goal by using a robotic microfluidic device to assess the specific activity of Mtb and bovine proteasomes toward a combinatorial library of 5,920 fluorescently tagged tripeptides, assaying each substrate individually. For comparison, we also tested recombinant proteins from another Actinomycete, Rhodococcus erythropolis. Finally, we validated our findings through kinetic analyses with 21 tripeptides and 18 P1 amino acid analogs of bortezomib. Overexpression and purification of recombinant Mtb proteasome, Mtb PrcAB-OG, and Rhodococcus 20S followed the reported method (14Lin G. Hu G. Tsu C. Kunes Y.Z. Li H. Dick L. Parsons T. Li P. Chen Z.

The library was reconfigured from 96- to 384-well format. For assay, the substrate plates were prepared by mixing 1 ;l of the 1 mm stock and 70 ;l of microfluidics buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.005% Triton X-100) in 384-well polypropylene plates, yielding a substrate concentration of 14 ;m. On-chip dilution of substrate was 70%, for a final substrate concentration of 10 ;m. Individual substrates for kinetic analysis were custom synthesized by AnaSpec (San Jose, CA). Suc-LLVY-AMC was from Bachem Biosciences (King of Prussia, PA). Z-VLR-AMC was from MD Biosciences, Inc. (St. Paul, MN). Bortezomib and its analogs were synthesized in-house (Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge, MA). Caliper Chip Assay—A detailed description of method will be published elsewhere. 5C. Tsu, L. Dick, and M. Pantoliano, manuscript in preparation. In brief, the Caliper 220 Drug Discovery Systems (Caliper Technologies, Mountain View, CA) was set up according to the manufacturer's instructions. Taking into account an on-chip dilution of 30%, the final protein concentrations of the Mtb20SWT, Mtb20SOG, and Rhod20S were 500, 250, and 24 nm, respectively. The final concentration of bov20S and PA28a were 225 and 675 nm, respectively. The final concentration of each substrate was 10 ;m. The screening was carried out in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.005% Triton X-100, 5 mm ;-mercaptoethanol). The instrument reaction chamber was at 26 °C with 60% humidity. A FS267 or TF460 microfluidics chip was loaded into a Caliper 220 or 250 robot. The run pressure was set to make the on-chip reaction time ∼90 s for Mtb20SWT, ∼60S for Mtb20SOG and Rhod20S, and ∼30 s for bov20S with PA28a. Relative fluorescence units were recorded (excitation, 355 nm; emission, 420-480 nm). The data were collected in less than 12 h by the Caliper LabChip HTS software. Fluorogenic activity was determined for each sample using Caliper HTS Well Analyzer software. Sipper-to-sipper variations in the raw data were normalized by using the Cy5 (Caliper Technologies, Mountain View, CA) marker (FS267) or AMC control as a reference (TF460). The background fluorescence of the unhydrolyzed substrate was detected in real time in a parallel channel lacking enzyme (TF460: Mtb20WT, Mtb20SOG, Rhod20S; see Fig. 1c) or by the subtraction of a separate substrate-only data set (FS267: Bov20S). The final annotated data were exported to Spotfire Descisionsite (Spotfire, Somerville, MA) for display and quantitative analysis. Single-substrate Kinetic Assays—These were performed in 96-well format at final substrate concentrations of 1.56-200 ;m in 1% Me2SO at 37 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Enzyme concentrations were 13.3 nm for Mtb20S or Mtb20SOG, and 1.4-2.9 nm for human 20S and 5.5-11 nm PA28;. All of the reactions were done in 200-;l triplicate on a PolarStar Galaxy spectrofluorimeter plate reader (BMG Labtech, Durham, NC). Hydrolysis of AMC substrates was monitored fluorometrically with periodic shaking (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 460 nm). The linear ranges of the time course curve were used to calculate the initial reaction velocities. Raw fluorescence was converted to nm/min using an AMC standard curve. The steady-state parameters kcat and Km were determined by nonlinear regression in Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). Occasional outliers were omitted from the analysis, but no fewer than five concentrations were used. In some cases, only kcat/Km values could be obtained because of substrate inhibition and/or precipitation occurring at high concentrations. The error in the fit was less than 10% for bov20S and 15% for Mtb20SOG. IC50 Values of P1 Analogs of Bortezomib against Mtb Proteasome—These were performed in a 384-well format assay. 1 ;l of stock Me2SO solutions (5 mm to 0.25 ;m) of 22 inhibitors was spotted in duplicate in the wells of a black 384-well plate. For the Mtb20S proteasomes, 25 ;l of 2× substrate buffer (100 ;m in 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) were dispensed into each well using a Multidrop instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The plate was shaken for 3 min on an orbital shaker. Then 25 ;l of 2× enzyme buffer (10 nm in 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) were dispensed into each well. The plate was then spun at 1000 rpm for 1 min, and the progress of the reactions at 37 °C was monitored at 37 °C in a BMG plate reader as above for the AMC substrates. IC50 curves were determined by nonlinear regression to the Hill equation in Activity-Base (IDBS, Burlington, MA). The human RBC 20S assays were performed as described for the Mtb20S proteasomes, with the following modifications. The 2× substrate solution was 30 mm Ac-WLA-AMC, 0.05% SDS activator in 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The 2× enzyme solution was 3 nm human RBC proteasome in 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The error in the fit was less than 10% for both hu20S and Mtb20SOG. Ac-P3P2P1-AMC Library and Assay Design—The design of the combinatorial Ac-P3P2P1-AMC library is depicted in Fig. 1b. In addition to the 20 amino acids commonly incorporated into polypeptides, two additional natural amino acids, l-citrulline and l-ornithine, were incorporated in the P1 position for a total of 22. 20 amino acids (omitting l-citrulline and l-cysteine) were incorporated into the P2 and P3 positions. The N terminus of P3 was capped with an acetyl group. This has the distinct advantage of minimizing the influence of the artificial blocking group, as compared with the aromatic Z or acidic succinyl (Suc) often used in peptides. Of the possible 8,800 tripeptides (22 P1 × 20 P2 × 20 P3), 5,920 were usable based on yield and purity. The average purity was >90% and not less than 85% for any individual substrate (29Sheppeck J.E. 2nd, Kar H. Gosink L. Wheatley J.B. Gjerstad E. Loftus S.M. Zubiria A.R. Janc J.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 2639-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A robotically controlled microfluidic chip facilitated the performance of the 5,920 reactions with each of four proteasome preparations (Fig. 1c): Mtb20SWT, Mtb20SOG, Rhod20S, and bov20S. Substrate concentrations were kept at 10 ;m, equal to or a few-fold lower than the values of Km (10-200 ;m) previously reported for tri/tetrapeptide substrates (24Wang C.C. Bozdech Z. Liu C.L.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3899-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, reaction rates likely reflected the specific activity (kcat/Km) in the absence of substrate saturation effects. Stream splitting and simultaneous fluorescence detection facilitated subtraction of the background fluorescence of each unhydrolyzed substrate (Fig. 1c). Overall Intra- and Interspecies Comparisons—As reported with other substrates (14Lin G. Hu G. Tsu C. Kunes Y.Z. Li H. Dick L. Parsons T. Li P. Chen Z. Zwickl P. Weich N. Nathan C. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1405-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), Mtb20SWT was up to 20-fold less active than Mtb20SOG. In the initial set of experiments, we used twice as much Mtb20SWT as Mtb20SOG and an increased reaction time to evaluate the correlation of specific activities for different substrates between Mtb20SWT and Mtb20SOG. This allowed us to establish that Mtb20SOG could serve as an authentic reporter of the Mtb proteasome for subsequent interspecies comparisons. Thus, a plot of the activity of Mtb20SWT and Mtb20SOG for each substrate yielded the correlation coefficient R2 = 0.78 (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that the substrate preferences of the two Mtb proteasome preparations were highly similar. In contrast, the correlation coefficients between results for Mtb20SOG and Rhod20S (R2 = 0.11), Mtb20SOG and bov20S (R2 = 0.03), and Rhod20S and bov20S (R2 = 0.45) (supplemental Fig. S1) showed that the Mtb proteasome stood apart in its tripeptide substrate preferences from the preferences exhibited by proteasomes of the other two species. Preferences of Mtb, Rhodococcus, and Bovine Proteasomes for Individual N-Ac-tripeptides—Our earlier biochemical characterization of the Mtb proteasome with Z-capped tripeptide and tetrapeptide substrates revealed multiple proteolytic activities with a preference for basic P1 residues (14Lin G. Hu G. Tsu C. Kunes Y.Z. Li H. Dick L. Parsons T. Li P. Chen Z. Zwickl P. Weich N. Nathan C. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1405-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, with N-acetyl tripeptides, Mtb proteasomes demonstrated only chymotryptic activity (P1 = Phe, Leu, Ile, Trp, or Tyr) (Fig. 2, a and b), with the exception of a few tripeptides with P1 = His (Table 1). These observations confirmed that constituents at one position (in this case, the N terminus) could markedly affect the preference of the proteasome for particular side chains at a different position (in this case, P1). Among the N-acetyl tripeptides, Mtb20SOG was strongly biased toward P1 = Trp. The most preferred substrate, WQW, allowed a 2-fold higher specific activity than RWH, the most favored tripeptide that lacked P1 = Trp. Among the 30 most preferred substrates (top 0.5% of the library), 28 had P1 = Trp and 2 had P1 = His. At P2, Gln and Trp were the most favored amino acids. The S3 site appeared to be more accommodating, because most amino acid residues were represented at the P3 position in the top 1% of the most preferred substrates. However, acidic residues (Asp and Glu) were disfavored at P3. This might be explained by the presence of Asp30 at the bottom of the S3 pocket (25Groll M. Nazif T. Huber R. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Preferred amino acids at given positions for Mtb 20SOG, Rhod20S, and bov20SOptimal amino acids at given positionP3P2P1Mtb20SOGaromatic ≈ hydrophobic ≈ neutral ≈ basicGln ≈ Trp >> Orn ≈ Thr ≈ Ser ≈ PheTrp >> His > Tyr > Phe > ArgRhod20STyr > Leu ≈ Trp ≈ Phenon-definedLeu > Phe ≈ Ile > TrpBov20STyr > Trp > Phe > Leu > Argnon-aromaticLeu >> Arg ≈ Phe ≈ His > Met Open table in a new tab Rhod20S behaved as a typical chymotryptic proteasome (Fig. 2c), with a preference for hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids at P1 (Table 1). Unlike the Mtb proteasome, there was no strong bias toward one P1 amino acid. Also in contrast to the Mtb proteasome, Rhod20S displayed no activity for any substrates having P1 = His. Among the top 1% of the most preferred substrates for Rhod20S, most of the uncharged amino acids were found at P2 and P3. As expected, bov20S displayed three protease-like activities (Fig. 2d). A preference at P1 for hydrophobic and aromatic amino acid residues reflected chymotryptic activity; for Arg and Lys, tryptic activity; and for Asp and Glu, caspase-like activity. For chymotryptic activity, the preferred tripeptide sequences were P1 = Leu/Phe/Tyr, P2 = Gln/Ser/Leu, and P3 = Tyr/Phe/Trp (Table 1). However, the P1 = Leu and P3 = Tyr were the most favored, whereas the hydrophilic P1 = Asn and P3 = Orn/Asn were the least favored (supplemental Fig. S2). For tryptic activity, the preferred amino acids were P1 = Arg and P3 = Arg and Lys, with acidic residues strongly disfavored at P3. This differed from the profile of human 20S determined in a tetrapeptidyl 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin positional scanning library when P1 was fixed as Arg, where the preferred P3 was Glu and Lys, whereas P3 = Arg was disfavored (22Harris J.L. Alper P.B. Li J. Rechsteiner M. Backes B.J. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 31Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). For caspase-like activity of bov20S, the P2 amino acids appeared to be more determinant than the P3 amino acids, because the preferred sequences were Ac-X(F/W/Y)(D/E), whereas the most disfavored were Ac-(E/K/R)X(D/E)-AMC (supplemental Fig. S2). The preference of bov20S for basic residues at P3 of tryptic substrates (supplemental Fig. S2) may reflect the presence of Asp28 of the ;2 chain at the bottom of the S3 pocket, which can form hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with protonated guanidino or amino groups (25Groll M. Nazif T. Huber R. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). P2 amino acids were less of a determinant than P1 and P3. Comparison of Preferences of Mtb and Bovine Proteasomes for Shared Substrates—To aid in comparison of large data sets, we performed hierarchical clustering analysis of substrate specificity for proteasomes from the three species, as illustrated in Fig. 3 for the comparison of Mtb20SOG and bov20S at P1 and P3. The clustergram revealed 12 subgroups with different pairs of residues at P1 and P3 that contain more preferred substrates for Mtb20SOG than for bov20S: Trp/Ala, Trp/Gly, Trp/Lys, Trp/Orn, Trp/Pro, Trp/Arg, Thr/Glu, Thr/Gln, Arg/Pro, Arg/Asp, Orn/His, and Orn/Asn. Because Mtb20SOG was only substantially active on substrates with P1 = Trp, we next focused on this subgroup of substrates in comparing preferences of Mtb20SOG and bov20S. The correlation between their activities yielded R2 = 0.33 (not shown), indicative of a partial overlap in substrate preferences. However, two subgroups were much more favored by Mtb20SOG than by bov20S: those with sequences Ac-G"
https://openalex.org/W2014370614,"Development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is initiated by the formation of postsynaptic specializations in the central zones of muscles, followed by the arrival of motor nerve terminals opposite the postsynaptic regions. The post- and presynaptic components are then stabilized and modified to form mature synapses. Roles of ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) family proteins in the formation of the NMJ have not been reported previously.We report here that Meltrin beta, ADAM19, participates in the formation of the NMJ. The zone of acetylcholine receptor alpha mRNA distribution was broader and excess sprouting of motor nerve terminals was more prominent in meltrin beta-deficient than in wild-type embryonic diaphragms. A microarray analysis revealed that the preferential distribution of ephrin-A5 mRNA in the synaptic region of muscles was aberrant in the meltrin beta-deficient muscles. Excess sprouting of motor nerve terminals was also found in ephrin-A5 knockout mice, which lead us to investigate a possible link between Meltrin beta and ephrin-A5-Eph signaling in the development of the NMJ. Meltrin beta and EphA4 interacted with each other in developing motor neurons, and both of these proteins localized in the NMJ. Coexpression of Meltrin beta and EphA4 strongly blocked vesicular internalization of ephrin-A5-EphA4 complexes without requiring the protease activity of Meltrin beta, suggesting a regulatory role of Meltrin beta in ephrin-A5-Eph signaling.Meltrin beta plays a regulatory role in formation of the NMJ. The endocytosis of ephrin-Eph complexes is required for efficient contact-dependent repulsion between ephrin and Eph. We propose that Meltrin beta stabilizes the interaction between ephrin-A5 and EphA4 by regulating endocytosis of the ephrinA5-EphA complex negatively, which would contribute to the fine-tuning of the NMJ during development."
https://openalex.org/W2071081142,"Background Legionella pneumophila, is an intracellular pathogen that causes Legionnaires' disease in humans, a potentially lethal pneumonia. L. pneumophila has the ability to enter and replicate in the host and is essential for pathogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings Phagocytosis was measured by cell invasion assays. Construction of PI3K mutant by PCR cloning and expression of dominant negative mutant was detected by Western blot. PI3K activity was measured by 32P labeling and detection of phospholipids products by thin layer chromatography. Infection of macrophages with virulent L. pneumophila stimulated the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PIP3), a phosphorylated lipid product of PI3K whereas two structurally distinct phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, reduced L. pneumophila entry into macrophages in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, PI3K activation led to Akt stimulation, a serine/threonine kinase, which was also inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002. In contrast, PI3K and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activities were lower in macrophages infected with an avirulent bacterial strain. Only virulent L. pneumophila increased lipid kinase activity present in immunoprecipitates of the p85α subunit of class I PI3K and tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. In addition, macrophages expressing a specific dominant negative mutant of PI3K reduced L. pneumophila entry into these cells. Conclusion/Significance Entry of L. pneumophila is mediated by PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These results suggest an important role for PI3K and Akt in the L. pneumophila infection process. They point to possible novel strategies for undermining L. pneumophila host uptake and reducing pathogenesis of Legionnaires' disease."

Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the induction of certain forms of asthma (9Steenwinckel V. Louahed J. Orabona C. Huaux F. Warnier G. McKenzie A. Lison D. Levitt R. Renauld J.C. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 3244-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).IL-2 and IL-9 act through binding to specific cell-surface receptors. The high affinity IL-2R is comprised of three separate chains, termed α (CD25), β (CD122), and γ (γc, CD132), which is a Janus tyrosine kinase 3 (JAK3)-interacting chain common to many cytokine receptors, including IL-2 and IL-9 receptors (10Leonard W.J.

IL-2Rα by itself has only low affinity to IL-2 and is not directly involved in signal transduction (16Wang H.M. Smith K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1055-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the absence of IL-2Rα, the IL-2Rβ/γc heterocomplex is sufficient to support IL-2 binding and signaling (17Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Mess S.A. Friedmann M. Erdos M. Francois C. Jacques Y. Adelstein S. Leonard W.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We, therefore, focused on the interactions of the latter subunits. In contrast, the IL-9R has only one ligand binding chain (designated IL-9Rα), which interacts with γc for signaling via activation of JAK3 (8Knoops L. Renauld J.C. Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Kimura Y. Takeshita T. Kondo M. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Van Snick J. Sugamura K. Int.

Willerford D.M. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of a “modulatory” chain equivalent to IL-2Rα makes it interesting to compare the interactions between the subunits of the IL-9R and those of the IL-2R system.Complex formation among the subunits of these receptors is an essential feature of their signaling, as they function as heteromeric complexes between the ligand binding receptor chain and the common γc that recruits JAK3 to the complex (20Leonard W.J. Shores E.W. Love P.E. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 148: 97-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Nelson B.H. Willerford D.M. Adv.

Biol. 2004; 24: 5039-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Early fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based studies were conducted on IL-2R but not on IL-9R. In that study (23Damjanovich S. Bene L. Matko J. Alileche A. Goldman C.K. Sharrow S. Waldmann T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13134-13139Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) the existence of preassembled heterocomplexes between α/β, β/γc, or α/γc of the IL-2R, which were modulated by ligand binding, was reported. However, the experiments were conducted mostly on cells expressing a high excess of IL-2Rα over the other subunits and did not explore homomeric complexes. Recent crystallographic studies on the quaternary structure of the soluble ectodomains of IL-2R subunits suggested that IL-2 first binds to IL-2Rα, enhancing IL-2 binding to IL-2Rβ, followed by recruitment of γc to the IL-2/IL-2Rβ complex (14Wang X. Rickert M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2005; 310: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 15Stauber D.J. Debler E.W. Horton P.A. Smith K.A. Wilson I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2788-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Despite the functional importance of IL-2R and IL-9R oligomerization, many aspects of the interaction between the subunits comprising these receptors and their potential modulation by ligand binding and/or JAK1 and JAK3 are still unclear, especially in their native milieu (the plasma membrane of live cells). We tackled these questions by combining computerized immunofluorescence co-patching (24Constantinescu S.N. Keren T. Russ W.P. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Malka Y. Kubatzky K.F. Engelman D.M. Lodish H.F.

Microsc. 2003; 212: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) to quantify both homomeric and heteromeric complex formation of IL-2R and IL-9R subunits with signaling assays in live cells. Our data demonstrate that the signaling subunits of both receptors (IL-2Rβ, IL-9Rα, and γc) display a subpopulation of preassembled homomeric complexes, which is not altered by ligand. On the other hand, hetero-oligomerization of both IL-2Rβ and IL-9Rα with γc existed before ligand binding but was significantly augmented by the relevant ligands, and IL-2Rβ/γc complex formation was insensitive to co-expression of IL-2R. The hetero-oligomerization of IL-2 and IL-9 receptor subunits with γc, even in the presence of JAK3, did not result in activation unless ligand was present, suggesting that oligomerization per se does not suffice for activation. However, we hypothesized that such preformed complexes could serve as scaffolds for activation of mutated JAK proteins, such as those recently described for JAK1 (26Flex E. Petrangeli V. Stella L.

Indeed, we show that preformed complexes of IL-2Rβ or IL9Rα and γc support signaling by the constitutively active JAK3 A572V.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—BOSC23 cells (derived from HEK293T cells and expressing the gag, pol, and env proteins of the Moloney leukemia ecotropic virus (28Pear W.S.

Ba/F3 cells (IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cells) were maintained and transduced as described (31Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F. Moucadel V. Krishnakumar S. Smith S.O. Constantinescu S.N.

BETT cells (human T-ALL cells) were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum.Plasmids and Recombinant Virus Vectors—The human IL-2Rβ, IL-9Rα, and γc cDNAs were cloned in the pMX-IRES-GFP1.1 retroviral vector (32Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding these proteins were cloned upstream of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) followed by a GFP construct, such that transfection can be monitored by low level expression (at a level that does not interfere with regular immunofluorescence studies) of GFP (32Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A.

Each construct was tagged extracellularly with either the 12CA5 influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag (YPYDVPDYA) or the 9E10 Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL), with tags being introduced downstream of the predicted signal sequence cleavage site as described earlier (30Constantinescu S.N.

Thus, in IL-2Rβ the tags were inserted between residues Thr-31 and Ser-32, in IL-9Rα between residues Gln-26 and Gly-27 (designating the Met followed immediately by the signal sequence as 1, where the actual translation starts), and in γc between residues Ile-27—Leu-28. IL-2Rα cDNA (untagged) and human wild-type or JAK3 A572V mutant cDNAs were subcloned in pREX-IRES-CD4 (34Royer Y. Staerk J. Costuleanu M. Courtoy P.J. Constantinescu S.N. J. Biol.

Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Generation of Stable Cell Lines—High titer replication-defective retroviral supernatants were generated from BOSC23 cells (serving as a packaging cell line) after transfection with the retroviral bicistronic vectors encoding the constructs mentioned above as described (32Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The viruses thus produced were used to transduce Ba/F3 cells by centrifugation in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). The efficiency of infection was usually 40-50%. Populations of cells expressing the GFP marker above a predetermined level (top 10%) were isolated by FACS sorting.Immunofluorescence Co-patching—BOSC23 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 6-well dishes (2 × 105 cells/dish). After 24 h, they were co-transfected with the different epitope-tagged IL-R subunits at various combinations using 1 μg of DNA of each construct complemented to 6 μg by empty vector. In some cases expression vectors for untagged IL-9Rα, IL-2Rβ, or IL-2Rα were also included (see Fig. 3 legend). Experiments were performed 44-48 h after transfection with calcium phosphate (Sigma). To measure receptor oligomerization, we employed antibody-mediated immunofluorescence co-patching (24Constantinescu S.N. Keren T. Russ W.P. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Malka Y. Kubatzky K.F.

Cells expressing pairs of receptors carrying different epitope tags (e.g. Myc-IL-9Rα together with HA-IL-9Rα) were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated 30 min at 37 °C to allow digestion of serum-derived ligands. After washing twice with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 2% BSA (HBSS/Hepes/BSA; all from Sigma), the cells were incubated with normal goat γ globulin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 200 μg/ml, 30 min, 4 °C) to block nonspecific binding. This was followed by successive incubation in the cold (to avoid internalization) in HBSS/Hepes/BSA with primary anti-tag IgGs (20 μg/ml each, 45 min); that is, rabbit HA.11 against the HA tag (anti-HA) together with 9E10 mouse anti-Myc (both from Covance Research Products) followed by labeling/patching with secondary Alexa594-goat anti-rabbit and Alexa488-goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes; 20 μg/ml each, 30 min, 4 °C). In some control experiments using a FLAG-tagged construct, mouse anti-FLAG IgG (M2; Sigma) was employed. The cells were washed and fixed in methanol (5 min, -20 °C) and acetone (3 min, -20 °C) and mounted in Prolong Antifade (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes). In experiments where ligands were present, human IL-9 (750 units/ml; produced in baculovirus as described in Renauld et al. (38Renauld J.C. Goethals A. Houssiau F. Van Roost E. Van Snick J. Cytokine. 1990; 2: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) or IL-2 (500 units/ml; Sigma) was added at 4 °C 30 min before labeling with IgGs and maintained during all subsequent incubations. For Ba/F3 cells, a similar protocol was employed, except that incubations with IgGs were carried out on cells in 100 μl of suspension. For washing, Ba/F3 cells were centrifuged for 1 min and resuspended in 100 μl of HBSS/Hepes/BSA. After antibody labeling, the Ba/F3 cells were mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips using cytospin centrifuge (5 min, medium speed) as described (34Royer Y. Staerk J. Costuleanu M. Courtoy P.J. Constantinescu S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27251-27261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) followed by fixation in methanol and acetone.Fluorescence digital images were recorded using a CCD camera as described (25Lachmanovich E. Shvartsman D.E. Malka Y. Botvin C. Henis Y.I. Weiss A.M. J. Microsc. 2003; 212: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Alexa488 (green) and Alexa594 (red) images were exported in TIFF format to Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics) and subjected to quantitative analysis of the extent of co-patching using an algorithm we have recently developed (25Lachmanovich E. Shvartsman D.E. Malka Y. Botvin C. Henis Y.I. Weiss A.M. J. Microsc. 2003; 212: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, the program segments the patches in a user-defined region of interest, subtracts the background, and identifies the center of each object in the green and red images. This is followed by nearest-neighbor analysis, calculating the distances from the center of green patch to that of the nearest red patch (and vice versa). Patches whose nearest neighbor is within one optical resolution unit (up to 0.2 μm) are considered colocalized (25Lachmanovich E. Shvartsman D.E. Malka Y. Botvin C. Henis Y.I. Weiss A.M. J. Microsc. 2003; 212: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The % co-patching of e.g. green with red patches is given by dividing the number of the green patches colocalized with red patches by the total number of green patches. 20-25 cells were analyzed in each case.Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay—HEK293 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with vectors encoding the IL-R ligand binding subunits and γc as well as wild-type or mutant JAK3 A572V where indicated (200 ng DNA/well each vector, replacing JAK3 vector with empty vector in controls). To test for STAT transcriptional activation, the STAT3-responsive or STAT5-responsive luciferase constructs (250 ng/well) were co-transfected into the cells together with 100 ng/well of a control vector (pRL-TK, expressing constitutively active Renilla luciferase; Promega) to calibrate for transfection efficiency. STAT5-mediated transcription was evaluated with the pLHRE-luc reporter gene constructs harboring tandem copies of the STAT5-inducible lactogenic hormone response element (LHRE) of the rat β-casein gene promoter, inserted upstream a luciferase gene (39Gerland K. Bataille-Simoneau N. Basle M. Fourcin M. Gascan H. Mercier L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 168: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). STAT3-mediated transcription was evaluated with pGL3-pap1-luc plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of the STAT3-inducible rat Pap1 (pancreatitis-associated protein-1) promoter (40Peelman F.

After 4 h the cells were stimulated with 100 units/ml IL-2 or 100 units/ml IL-9 for 20 h and lysed with passive lysis buffer as described (31Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F. Moucadel V.

Firefly (STAT reporter) and Renilla (control vector) luciferase activities were measured with the dual-luciferase reporter kit (Promega). To normalize for transfection efficiency, the results of firefly luciferase activity were divided by those of the respective Renilla luciferase activity.FACS Analysis—BETT (T-ALL) cells or Ba/F3 cells expressing HA-tagged human IL-2Rβ and Myc-tagged human γc were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. 3 × 105 cells were stained by monoclonal anti-human IL-2Rβ (R&D systems) or anti-human γc (BD Biosciences) antibody coupled with phycoerythrin, according to manufacturer's recommendations (1 h, 4 °C). These antibodies detect both untagged endogenous receptor subunits and transduced tagged receptors and, thus, provide a means to compare cell surface levels. After washing by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS with 0.1% fetal calf serum, and cell surface expression of human IL-2Rβ and human γc was analyzed on 104 cells by a BD FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). An aliquot of non-stained cells was used as autofluorescence control. We employed quantitative fluorescence cytometry to measure absolute levels of receptors at the cell surface expressed as molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF values). To the obtained MESF values Sphero Rainbow Calibration particles were used to calibrate the flow cytometer scale. The mean/median relative fluorescence intensity channel value for each bead population was calculated using Cell Quest software. A calibration curve was constructed, and subsequent data from the analyzed samples obtained from mean/median relative fluorescence intensity were converted to MESF for each antibody. All data were corrected for autofluorescence quantified in the same way.RESULTSCell-surface IL-2Rβ, IL-9Rα, and γc Form Ligand-independent Homomeric Complexes—In view of the proposed importance of the oligomeric state of IL-2 and IL-9 receptors for their activation, we conducted experiments to determine whether the ligand binding chains of these receptors (IL-2Rβ and IL-9Rα) form stable homo-oligomers before ligand binding or only in the presence of ligand (ligand-induced oligomerization). To detect the formation of homomeric complexes of the intact receptor chains in their natural environment (the plasma membrane of live cells), we employed a computerized digital analysis version of immunofluorescence co-patching (Ref. 25Lachmanovich E.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), is based on the expression at the surface of live cells of two receptors tagged with different epitope tags at their extracellular termini. One receptor is forced into micropatches by a double layer of bivalent IgGs using a fluorescent (e.g. green) secondary IgG. The co-expressed receptor, which carries a different epitope tag, is patched/labeled by anti-tag primary IgG from another species and secondary antibodies coupled to another fluorophore (red). Receptors in mutual oligomers are swept into mutual micropatches, which appear yellow when the two images are overlapped. To measure the homo-oligomerization of IL-2Rβ, IL-9Rα, or γc, we co-expressed Myc and HA-tagged versions of each protein in BOSC23 cells and subjected them to immunofluorescence co-patching studies in the absence or presence of ligand. Co-patching was determined by algorithms written for Image-Pro Plus, defining green and red patches as overlapping if their intensity peaks were separated by less than 0.2 μm (25Lachmanovich E. Shvartsman D.E. Malka Y. Botvin C. Henis Y.I. Weiss A.M. J. Microsc. 2003; 212: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To evaluate the level of random co-patching (uncorrelated overlap of patches) in the same image (which depends on the surface density of the patches), a “randomized” region of interest was created by overlaying the green image of a given region of interest upon the red image of an identically sized neighboring region (see Fig. 1, C and G). This way, any co-localization reflects random overlap of patches due to their finite density at the cell surface. These randomized values can then be subtracted to obtain the actual co-patching (% co-patching). Typical images showing the co-patching be"

Two pieces in this issue focus on what must be one of the top priorities in science today: the quest for a viable HIV/AIDS vaccine. Dan Barouch's Review Article charts the trials and tribulations of work that has so far led only to failed vaccine candidates. Barouch argues that HIV-1 vaccine science is still in its infancy, and that a renewed emphasis on basic discovery research is needed if the field is to advance. Ruslan Medzhitov and Dan Littman also stress the need for basic research, principally in immunology, where some of the established models and assumptions may simply not be relevant to retroviral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2088770713,"Background Cowpea Mosaic Virus (CPMV) is increasingly being used as a nanoparticle platform for multivalent display of molecules via chemical bioconjugation to the capsid surface. A growing variety of applications have employed the CPMV multivalent display technology including nanoblock chemistry, in vivo imaging, and materials science. CPMV nanoparticles can be inexpensively produced from experimentally infected cowpea plants at high yields and are extremely stable. Although CPMV has not been shown to replicate in mammalian cells, uptake in mammalian cells does occur in vitro and in vivo. Thus, inactivation of the virus RNA genome is important for biosafety considerations, however the surface characteristics and chemical reactivity of the particles must be maintained in order to preserve chemical and structural functionality. Methodology/Principal Findings Short wave (254 nm) UV irradiation was used to crosslink the RNA genome within intact particles. Lower doses of UV previously reported to inactivate CPMV infectivity inhibited symptoms on inoculated leaves but did not prohibit systemic virus spread in plants, whereas higher doses caused aggregation of the particles and an increase in chemical reactivity further indicating broken particles. Intermediate doses of 2.0–2.5 J/cm2 were shown to maintain particle structure and chemical reactivity, and cellular binding properties were similar to CPMV-WT. Conclusions These studies demonstrate that it is possible to inactivate CPMV infectivity while maintaining particle structure and function, thus paving the way for further development of CPMV nanoparticles for in vivo applications."

Here we report that helical peptide inhibitors designed to mimic SPP substrates and interact with the SPP initial substrate-binding site (the “docking site”) inhibit both SPP and γ-secretase, but with submicromolar potency for SPP. SPP was labeled by helical peptide and transition-state analogue affinity probes but at distinct sites. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which shift the site of proteolysis by SPP and γ-secretase, did not affect the labeling of SPP or γ-secretase by the helical peptide or transition-state analogue probes. On the other hand, another class of previously reported γ-secretase modulators, naphthyl ketones, inhibited SPP activity as well as selective proteolysis by γ-secretase. These naphthyl ketones significantly disrupted labeling of SPP by the helical peptide probe but did not block labeling of SPP by the transition-state analogue probe. With respect to γ-secretase, the naphthyl ketone modulators allowed labeling by the transition-state analogue probe but not the helical peptide probe. Thus, the naphthyl ketones appear to alter the docking sites of both SPP and γ-secretase. These results indicate that pharmacological effects of the four different classes of inhibitors (transition-state analogues, helical peptides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and naphthyl ketones) are distinct from each other, and they reveal similarities and differences with how they affect SPP and γ-secretase.

Aβ is the primary protein component of the hallmark plaques in the AD brain, and aggregated Aβ is widely thought to cause the onset of AD (1Citron M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The 4-kDa Aβ is produced from the amyloid β-protein precursor (APP), a type I integral membrane protein, through sequential proteolysis by β-secretase and γ-secretase. γ-Secretase is composed of four essential membrane proteins, including presenilin (PS), Pen-2, nicastrin, and Aph-1 (2Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7931-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), with one of each component being sufficient for proteolytic activity (3Sato T. Diehl T.S. Narayanan S. Funamoto S.

PS is the catalytic component of the enzyme (4Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar), and missense mutations in PS cause early onset familial AD and alter the length of the products, Aβ (5Tanzi R.E. Bertram L. Cell. 2005; 120: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD) (6Sato T. Dohmae N. Qi Y. Kakuda N. Misonou H. Mitsumori R.

Although a minor species, the 42-residue Aβ42 is initially deposited in the AD brain instead of the more predominant 40-residue Aβ40 (7Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar), and Aβ42 is especially implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. As the proportion of Aβ42 to Aβ40 is determined by γ-secretase, this membrane-embedded aspartyl protease is a major target for the development of AD drugs (8Tomita T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2007; 377: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is an intramembrane aspartyl protease with homology to PS (9Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). SPP cleaves membrane protein signal sequences (i.e. with type II orientation), including the major histocompatibility complex class I signal sequence for generating human leukocyte antigen E epitopes (10Lemberg M.K. Bland F.A. Weihofen A. Braud V.M. Martoglio B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6441-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and is also responsible for the maturation of the hepatitis C virus core protein (11McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), the latter suggesting that modulation of SPP activity may be suitable for antiviral therapy. Similar to PS, SPP has aspartate-containing YD and LGLGD motifs within adjacent transmembrane domains that include the active site and a PAL motif near the C terminus (12Wang J. Beher D. Nyborg A.C. Shearman M.S. Golde T.E. Goate A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 6: 218-227Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar); however, each of these motifs is flipped in the membrane when comparing PS and SPP, correlating with the opposite orientation of their respective substrates.Despite their opposite membrane orientations, the biochemical properties of these two proteases are similar, especially upon detergent solubilization from the asymmetric environment of the lipid bilayer. SPP is inhibited by transition-state analogue inhibitors for γ-secretase (13Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Friedmann E. Rueeger H. Schmitz A. Paganetti P. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16528-16533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and analogous to γ-secretase, which requires prior substrate cleavage by α- or β-secretase, SPP requires prior cleavage of the substrate by signal peptidase (14Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recently, we developed an in vitro cell-free SPP assay system, which uses n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM)-solubilized membrane fractions and a synthetic substrate based on an SPP-cleaved signal sequence, and we showed that a subset of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) shifted the cleavage site of SPP. This shift in the SPP cleavage site by certain NSAIDs was similar to that observed for γ-secretase cleavage sites (15Sato T. Nyborg A.C. Iwata N. Diehl T.S. Saido T.C. Golde T.E. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that the NSAID-binding site on the γ-secretase complex might reside on PS, at a site conserved in SPP.On the other hand, there are also critical differences between SPP and γ-secretase. Unlike γ-secretase, SPP does not form a proteolytic complex with other components (9Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and SPP expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli has the appropriate proteolytic activity without coexpression or copurification of any other proteins (16Narayanan S. Sato T. Wolfe M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20172-20179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PS undergoes endoproteolysis into an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF) during maturation to an active protease, whereas SPP is active as its full-length protein (9Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Moreover, γ-secretase cleaves the APP transmembrane domain at least twice, whereas SPP cleaves its substrate mainly at one site (15Sato T. Nyborg A.C. Iwata N. Diehl T.S. Saido T.C. Golde T.E. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Investigation of similarities and differences between SPP and γ-secretase is important for developing specific inhibitors as AD drugs as well as for understanding common features shared by intramembrane aspartyl proteases. In this study, we examined the effect of inhibitors on SPP and γ-secretase activities using photoaffinity probes based on either a helical peptide inhibitor or a transition-state analogue inhibitor. Taking advantage of these two classes of probes, we carried out competition studies with other compounds, including two classes of γ-secretase modulators, NSAIDs and naphthyl ketones, and demonstrate that all four pharmacological classes (transition-state analogues, helical peptides, NSAIDs and naphthyl ketones) affect SPP and γ-secretase in distinct ways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis and Characterization—Helical peptide inhibitors were synthesized by standard solution or solid-phase procedures using amino acids and α-amino-isobutyric acid as described previously (17Das C. Berezovska O. Diehl T.S. Genet C. Buldyrev I. Tsai J.Y. Hyman B.T. Wolfe M.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 11794-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Bihel F. Das C. Bowman M.J.

Peptides were purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a C18 column and subsequently characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis on a Voyager-DE STR biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystems). CD spectra were acquired using an Aviv 62A DS spectropolarimeter. Photoaffinity probes were prepared by replacing each residue of a 10-residue peptide (compound 8, Fig. 1A) with 4-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa; Sigma) to identify those that retained SPP inhibitory activity. For the two Bpa-containing compounds that showed the best SPP inhibitory activity (Fig. 4A), biotin (Sigma) was coupled to the N terminus. All peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare stock solutions.FIGURE 4Photolabeling of SPP and competition with inhibitors. A, helical peptide photoaffinity probes. Bt and Bpa indicate biotin and 4-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine, respectively. B, inhibitory profiles of Bpa1 and Bpa2. Solubilized membrane fractions from SPP-transfected CHO cells were incubated for 90 min with Prl substrate in the presence of various concentrations of Bpa1 and Bpa2.

Bihel F. Das C. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We showed previously that certain biochemical characteristics of SPP were very similar to those of γ-secretase, suggesting that SPP is a simple model for the PS-containing γ-secretase complex (15Sato T. Nyborg A.C. Iwata N. Diehl T.S. Saido T.C. Golde T.E. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To further understand substrate- and inhibitor-binding sites on SPP, we designed helical peptide inhibitors based on two of its substrates, the signal sequences of prolactin (Prl) and calreticulin (CRT) (14Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We created both helical l- and d-peptides, containing between 9 and 13 amino acids (Fig. 1A). These peptides contain α-amino-isobutyric acid (Aib), which is well known to favor helical conformations (26Karle I.L. Balaram P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6747-6756Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). These Aibs were placed every three or four residues so that the Aibs would be on one face of the helix and signal sequence residues would be along the other face for interaction with SPP. After purification by RP-HPLC, the identity and purity of the final compounds were verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown). The helical conformation of these peptides was demonstrated by CD spectra, and we confirmed that the helical character increased with the length of the peptides (data not shown), similar to what we have previously shown for Aib-containing helical peptide inhibitors of γ-secretase (17Das C. Berezovska O. Diehl T.S. Genet C. Buldyrev I. Tsai J.Y. Hyman B.T. Wolfe M.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 11794-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Bihel F. Das C. Bowman M.J. Wolfe M.S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 3931-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).We first characterized the inhibitory effect of these peptides using a proteolytic assay for SPP that we had previously developed, which utilizes a Prl signal sequence with an N-terminal Myc tag for detection and a double proline substitution to prevent confounding processing by signal peptidase (15Sato T. Nyborg A.C. Iwata N. Diehl T.S. Saido T.C. Golde T.E. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8649-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, we measured the conversion of this “Prl-PP” substrate to Prl cleavage products in a cell-free SPP assay system. Solubilized membrane fractions from CHO cells stably transfected with V5- and His-tagged SPP were incubated with Prl-PP in the presence of 1 μm of the helical peptide inhibitors for 90 min, and the samples were subjected to Western blot (Fig. 1B). We found that several inhibitors could block SPP-mediated cleavage of the Prl-PP substrate at 1 μm. The dose dependence of these helical peptides was then examined by quantifying the intensity of immunoblot signals (Fig. 1C). The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.TABLE 1Structures of Aib-containing peptides and their inhibitory potencies IC50 values were determined by measuring the level of Prl cleavage products.

The SN motif has been suggested to be critical for substrate cleavage by virtue of helix-destabilizing effects (14Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The LL replacement was designed to keep the Aib-containing peptides helical throughout. Cpds 7–16 are 9–13-residue peptides designed from the CRT signal sequence, the key difference being length. Even though Cpds 1, 3, 4, and 6 are more similar to the wild type Prl sequence than Cpds 2 and 5 (which have the SN to LL alteration), the enantiomeric Cpds 2 and 5 were very effective inhibitors. Similarly, results in Table 2 with the CRT-based peptides show that both l- and d-forms could be effective inhibitors with 12 residues being the optimal length in both cases (Cpds 10 and 15). This is similar to what we have reported previously for helical peptide inhibitors of γ-secretase, in which APP-based l- and d-peptides potently inhibited the protease with an optimal length of 12–13 residues (18Bihel F. Das C. Bowman M.J. Wolfe M.S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 3931-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). d-peptide 15 was particularly impressive, with an IC50 value of 274 nm. A key difference between these results and those seen with Aib-containing inhibitors of γ-secretase, although γ-secretase is much more effectively inhibited by d-peptides (17Das C. Berezovska O.

Chem. 2004; 47: 3931-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), SPP was inhibited by both l- and d-peptides to similar degrees, with similar IC50 values for enantiomeric pairs.Inhibitory Effects on γ-Secretase and SPP Cleavage Site Specificity—A number of γ-secretase inhibitors can also inhibit SPP (13Weihofen A.

Therefore, we analyzed whether these helical peptide SPP inhibitors affect γ-secretase activity and, if so, whether the inhibitory potencies versus the two enzymes correlate. CHAPSO-solubilized membrane fractions of γ-30 cells (19Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C with the APP-based recombinant substrate C100FLAG (20Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) in the presence of various inhibitors, the production of Aβ and AICD-FLAG was analyzed by Western blot. Cpds 2, 5, 10, and 15 at 1 μm slightly inhibited Aβ and AICD production (Fig. 2A). These inhibitors, Cpds 2, 5, 10, and 15, also displayed stronger potencies against SPP activity, demonstrating that both SPP and γ-secretase prefer the same sequences and length of helical peptide inhibitors at the initial substrate-binding site (docking site), thereby suggesting that the structure of the docking site of γ-secretase may partially resemble that of SPP. We then examined these inhibitors for dose-dependent effects (Fig. 2B). Cpds 2 and 5 inhibited the production of AICD-FLAG with IC50 values of 5.3 and 1.0 μm, respectively, whereas Cpds 10 and 15 inhibited the production of AICD-FLAG with IC50 values of 2.4 and 2.1 μm, respectively. These results demonstrate that the potencies of the inhibitors for SPP are severalfold higher than for γ-secretase. These Prl and CRT signal sequence-based d-peptides inhibited the γ-secretase activity with slightly higher potencies than their l-peptide counterparts; however, the differences in potency between l- and d-peptides was not high, as observed previously with helical peptide inhibitors based on APP (17Das C.

These earlier studies tested the Gtx element in isolation; we now assess the physiological relevance of this element in the context of two natural mRNAs that contain this sequence in their 5′ leaders, Gtx itself and FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2). 2′-O-Methyl-modified RNA oligonucleotides were employed to block mRNA-rRNA base pairing by targeting either the Gtx-binding site in 18S rRNA or Gtx elements in recombinant mRNAs containing the Gtx or FGF2 5′ leaders linked to a reporter cistron. Studies in cell-free lysates and transfected COS-7 cells showed that translation of mRNAs containing the Gtx or FGF2 5′ leaders was decreased by >50% when oligonucleotides targeting either the rRNA or mRNA were used. Specificity was demonstrated by showing that translation of the recombinant mRNAs was unaffected by control oligonucleotides. In addition, the specific oligonucleotides did not affect the translation of recombinant mRNAs in which the Gtx elements were mutated. Experiments performed using constructs containing Gtx and FGF2 5′ leader and coding sequences ruled out possible effects of the reporter cistron. Furthermore, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the oligonucleotides used in this study had little overall effect on the proteomes of cells transfected with these oligonucleotides. This study demonstrates that mRNA-rRNA base pairing affects the expression of two cellular mRNAs and describes a new approach for investigating putative mRNA-rRNA base pairing interactions in mammalian cells.

This study demonstrates that mRNA-rRNA base pairing affects the expression of two cellular mRNAs and describes a new approach for investigating putative mRNA-rRNA base pairing interactions in mammalian cells. Numerous mRNAs contain complementary matches to 18S rRNA, and it has been suggested that such sequences may affect translation by base pairing to each other (1Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M.

In earlier studies, we noted that the 5′ leader of the Gtx homeodomain mRNA contains a 9-nucleotide sequence with complementarity to sequences contained within helix 26 of mouse 18S rRNA (4Hu M.C.-Y.

Biochemical, functional, and genetic studies showed that this sequence element could mediate specific binding to 40S ribosomal subunits by base pairing to 18S rRNA and function as an internal ribosome entry site and as a translational enhancer element (TEE) 2The abbreviations used are: TEE, translational enhancer element; nt, nucleotide; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: TEE, translational enhancer element; nt, nucleotide; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. and ribosomal shunt site (3Chappell S.A.

We showed that this element could function in isolation and as a modular component of larger assemblages of elements, with additive or synergistic enhancements of activity depending on the nucleotide context and message configuration (3Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These properties of the Gtx element facilitated our analysis of its mechanism because the ability of the individual element to affect translation is relatively weak. However, the relatively weak activity of a single Gtx element raised questions regarding its physiological relevance. It was therefore important to perform studies to determine whether an individual Gtx element affects translation efficiency in the context of natural mRNAs that contain this sequence. In this study, we investigate the physiological contribution of the Gtx element to the translation of two such mRNAs: Gtx and FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2). The murine Gtx mRNA, also termed Nkx 6-2, is expressed in differentiated oligodendrocytes and testis germ cells (9Awatramani R. Scherer S. Grinspan J. Collarini E. Skoff R. O'Hagan D. Garbern J. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6657-6668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ren B. Robert F. Wyrick J.J. Aparicio O. Jennings E.G. Simon I. Zeitlinger J. Schreiber J. Hannett N. Kanin E.

The 5′ leader is 201 nucleotides in length, and the TEE is located 56 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. This mRNA encodes a homeobox protein that binds to DNA sequences within the promoters of the myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein genes (9Awatramani R. Scherer S. Grinspan J. Collarini E. Skoff R. O'Hagan D. Garbern J. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6657-6668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is thought to have a role in regulating myelin gene transcription in oligodendrocytes. The 5′ leader of the human FGF2 mRNA also contains a sequence matching the Gtx-TEE (11Bonnal S. Schaeffer C. Creancier L. Clamens S. Moine H. Prats A.C. Vagner S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as the sequence of the Gtx-binding site in rodent 18S rRNA is also found in humans, we chose the FGF2 mRNA for further analysis. The 5′ leader of this mRNA is 471 nucleotides in length and expresses five FGF2 isoforms from different initiation codons, including four noncanonical CUG codons and an AUG codon (13Florkiewicz R.Z. Sommer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3978-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 14Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.C. Klagsbrun M. Lelias J.M. Liauzun P. Chalon P. Tauber J.P.

Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The Gtx element is located at nucleotides 119–127, upstream of three CUG codons and the AUG codon. It is downstream of the first CUG codon, which is cap-dependent (16Yu P.J. Ferrari G. Galloway A.C. Mignatti P. Pintucci G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 1100-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this mRNA, the complementary match to 18S rRNA (13 of 14 nucleotides) is even more extensive than in the Gtx mRNA. The various FGF2 isoforms differ in subcellular localization, function, and relative abundance in different cells and tissues (15Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H.

This study investigates the extent to which the Gtx element contributes to the translation of the Gtx and FGF2 mRNAs by using antisense oligonucleotides to block either the Gtx-binding site in 18S rRNA or the Gtx element in either the Gtx or the FGF2 mRNAs. We expect that this antisense masking approach can also be used to identify other natural mRNAs that employ mRNA-rRNA base pairing, either via the Gtx element or through other binding sites in the 18S rRNA. DNA Constructs—Monocistronic constructs included those containing the Gtx and FGF2 5′ leaders linked to the Photinus luciferase cistron, as well as those containing these 5′ leaders linked to the corresponding Gtx or FGF2 coding sequences. Luciferase reporter constructs were generated using the pGL3c (Promega) plasmid, which expresses the mRNA via the SV40 promoter. The Gtx and FGF2 5′ leader sequences were synthesized by PCR amplification of oligonucleotide templates and cloned upstream of the Photinus luciferase cistron. Briefly, constructs expressing the Gtx 5′ leader and either the Gtx or luciferase coding sequences were cloned using AatII and NcoI restriction sites. The AatII site was introduced at the transcription start site to avoid inclusion of vector-derived sequence in the recombinant transcripts; the NcoI site contains the initiation codon. The Gtx coding sequences were obtained by PCR amplification of mouse genomic DNA. The PCR-generated fragment was digested with NcoI and XbaI, which was introduced through the PCR primer, and cloned into the vector containing the Gtx 5′ leader, as described above. Constructs containing the FGF2 5′ leader and luciferase or FGF2 coding sequences were similarly constructed except that the FGF2 coding sequences were synthesized by PCR amplification of oligonucleotide templates. Mutations in the Gtx element were introduced into the Gtx 5′ leader using annealed oligonucleotides that generated a 43-nt fragment with ApaI/BssHII sticky ends. For FGF2, annealed oligonucleotides generated a 38-nt fragment with SacII sticky ends. In both cases, the annealed oligonucleotides were used to replace the corresponding fragments from the 5′ leader. Oligonucleotides—2′-O-Methyl-modified RNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Thermo Scientific (Dharmacon RNAi Technologies). Oligonucleotide sequences are as follows, with the noncomplementary nucleotides in the Gtx-m1 and α-Gtx-m1 oligonucleotides underlined: Gtx, 5′ CCGGCGGGU 3′; Gtx-m1, 5′ CCGGAGGGU 3′; α-Gtx, 5′ ACCCGCCGG 3′; α-Gtx-m1, 5′ ACCCACCGG 3′; and Gtx-scrambled, 5′ CGGCGCUGG 3′. In Vitro Translation—Capped mRNAs were generated from plasmids linearized using ClaI, which is located downstream of the luciferase cistron, and were transcribed by using the mMessage mMachine (Ambion). RNAs were quantified by UV absorption at 260 nm. In vitro translation reactions were performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate as specified by the manufacturer (Promega) with the following modification: translation reactions were performed in 10 μl and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C instead of the proposed 50 μl reactions incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. These conditions were determined to be in the linear phase of the translation reaction. Transfection—FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) was used to transfect 1–3 × 105 COS-7 cells with 0.5 μg of reporter construct according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cotransfected either with a control construct p(SI/SIII)5βP (6Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which expresses Photinus luciferase, or pCMVβ (Clontech), which expresses the lacZ gene. Neither of the control mRNAs contain sequences similar to the Gtx element. Transfected cells were harvested 18–24 h after transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (6Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 2′-O-Methyl-modified RNA oligonucleotides were cotransfected with plasmids or were transfected alone using the abovementioned conditions at concentrations indicated in the figures. Analyses of Reporter Gene Activity and mRNA Levels—Luciferase activities were determined as described previously (6Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recombinant mRNA levels were determined by using ribonuclease protection assays (RPAIII kit; Ambion) with 1 μg of DNase-treated total RNA. Protected fragments were size-fractionated on 6% polyacrylamide-urea gels, visualized on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare), and quantified by using ALPHAEASEFC stand-alone software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Western Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were prepared 18–24 h after transfection; cell monolayers were scraped, resuspended in lysis buffer (RIPA Buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1× complete mix of protease inhibitor), and sonicated. Total protein in cell lysates was quantified using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. For Western blots, samples containing 25 μg of protein were heated for 10 min at 72 °C in SDS and dithiothreitol-containing sample buffer and separated in a 4–12% gradient BisTris polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with goat anti-Gtx or anti-FGF2 polyclonal IgG 1° antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized using the CDP Star chemiluminescent Western blot immunodetection kit (Roche Applied Science) with donkey anti-goat IgG 2° antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega). For control experiments, an anti-β-actin monoclonal mouse IgG 1° antibody (Sigma) and an anti-mouse IgG 2° antibody (Sigma) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were used to detect the β-actin protein. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Cell lysates were prepared 18–24 h after transfection by scraping the cell monolayers, resuspending in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, and 1% IGEPAL detergent), and sonicating. Total protein in cell lysates was quantified as above. Protein samples (50 μg per gel) were diluted to 125 μl in rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Bio-Lyte ampholytes, and 0.002% bromphenol blue). The indicated volume of each sample was applied to a gel strip (17 cm, pH 3–10, Bio-Rad), rehydrated for 16–20 h, and focused using a PROTEAN isoelectric focusing cell and in three steps as follows: 1) 250 V, 1 h linear; 2) 1000 V, 2 h linear; and 3) 10,000 V, 45,000 V-h rapid. Prior to running the second dimension, gel strips were either stored at –70 °C or equilibrated in 2 ml of equilibration buffer 1 (6 m urea, 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% w/v dithiothreitol) for 10 min. Isoelectric focusing strips were then equilibrated in equilibration buffer 2 (6 m urea, 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2.5% w/v iodoacetamide) for 10 min and run on 12% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein spots were stained using the Flamingo fluorescent gel stain (Bio-Rad), visualized at 532 nm using the Typhoon Trio Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare), and analyzed using the Progenesis SameSpots computer software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Durham, NC). Protein spots were reduced in-gel using 10 mm dithiothreitol, alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin in an estimated 1:30 enzyme to substrate ratio. The samples were then analyzed using the Agilent MSD 1100 nano-electrospray LC/MS/MS. MS/MS analysis was performed on the LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo) using 2 kV at the tip. One MS spectrum was followed by four MS/MS scans on the most abundant ions after the application of the dynamic exclusion list. Tandem mass spectra were subjected to peak picking using Xcalibur (version 2.0 SR2, Thermo Electron Corp.). Protein identification was performed using Mascot (version 2.1.04, Matrix Science, London, UK). Proteins were identified using a Mascot search (version 2.1.04, Matrix Science, London, UK) at a 95% confidence level using a data base of tryptic peptides derived from the NCBI annotation of primate genomes (June 6, 2008). Scores were adjusted to give a false-positive rate of <1% based on a decoy data base search. An ion score threshold of 35 gave an acceptable and low false-positive rate of 0.398 ± 0.57% using a dataset of 20 searches. All searches were done using this threshold, which included single peptide assignments that were included in the analysis. Oligonucleotide Masking of Gtx-binding Site in 18S rRNA Blocks Activity of Isolated Gtx Elements—The feasibility of using oligonucleotides to block the base pairing interaction between the Gtx TEE and 18S rRNA was tested using synthetic mRNA constructs containing five linked copies of the Gtx TEE in the 5′ leader of the Photinus luciferase mRNA. Comparable constructs were used in our earlier work to study this element in isolation (3Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 6Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Constructs were tested both in rabbit reticulocyte lysate using mRNAs transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and in transfected cells, with transcription driven by the SV40 promoter. For these studies, we used 2′-O-methyl-RNA oligonucleotides, which contain a methyl group at the 2′-OH residue of the ribose molecule. These modified oligonucleotides base pair with RNA more stably than DNA or unmodified RNA oligonucleotides; they are also more resistant to nuclease degradation than unmodified RNA oligonucleotides and do not target the hybridized region of the target RNA to digestion by RNase H, which is a potential limitation associated with DNA oligonucleotides (24Hogrefe H.H.

Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The results showed that increasing concentrations of the Gtx oligonucleotide, which targets the Gtx-binding site in 18S rRNA (nucleotides 1124–1132), led to progressively reduced luciferase activities from a construct containing five Gtx TEEs (p(Gtx9nt)5(SI)5β/P) either in an in vitro translation assay or in COS-7 transfected cells (supplemental Fig. 1A). Construct pGtx/P containing the full-length Gtx 5′ leader exhibited a similar trend both in vitro and in transfected COS-7 cells (supplemental Fig. 1B). Maximal inhibition was obtained using 1 μm both in the cell-free lysate and in cells. Cell-free studies were performed using in vitro transcribed Gtx reporter mRNAs in the absence or presence of the Gtx, scrambled, and Gtx-m1 oligonucleotides. Fig. 1A shows results obtained in the cell-free lysate with the reporter construct containing five Gtx TEEs (p(Gtx9nt)5(SI)5β/P) and 1 μm of the Gtx oligonucleotide. Luciferase expression was reduced by ≈50% compared with samples containing the Gtx reporter construct alone (no oligonucleotide). Control experiments using a scrambled oligonucleotide (Gtx-scrambled) and an oligonucleotide with a point mutation in the Gtx sequence (Gtx-m1) had no effect on luciferase expression, suggesting that the Gtx oligonucleotide specifically blocked the activity of the Gtx elements. Expression of a control construct (p(SI/SIII)5β/P) lacking Gtx elements was unaffected by any of the oligonucleotides, suggesting that the Gtx oligonucleotide affected translation of the Gtx reporter mRNA by blocking the activity of Gtx TEEs. These results are consistent with direct inhibition by the Gtx oligonucleotide of mRNA-rRNA base pairing. RNA analyses indicated that the decreased luciferase levels observed in samples incubated with the Gtx oligonucleotide were not because of decreased reporter mRNA levels but to a decrease in translation efficiency. Fig. 1B shows that comparable results were obtained when COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the reporter construct containing five Gtx TEEs and 1 μm of the Gtx oligonucleotide. Luciferase expression was reduced by ≈60% compared with cells transfected with the reporter construct alone (no oligonucleotide). The control oligonucleotides did not affect luciferase expression. In addition, control construct p(SI/SIII)5β/P was unaffected by any of the oligonucleotides. RNA analysis indicated that decreased luciferase levels in cells cotransfected with the Gtx oligonucleotide were not because of decreased reporter mRNA levels but to a decrease in translation efficiency. Antisense Masking Establishes Contribution of Gtx Elements in Gtx and FGF2 5′ Leaders—To begin to assess the contribution of an individual Gtx element in the context of a natural mRNA, we investigated the Gtx 5′ leader, which was the source of this element. In addition, we investigated the FGF2 5′ leader, which contains the nucleotide sequence of the Gtx element as well as a more extended complementary match to 18S rRNA (Fig. 2A). The contributions of these individual Gtx elements were initially tested using Photinus luciferase reporter constructs as follows: pGtx/P and FGF2/P, containing the full-length Gtx 5′ leader (201 nt), or FGF2 5′ leader (471 nt). The contribution of the Gtx element to the translation mediated by these two 5′ leaders was assessed using the Gtx oligonucleotide to block the Gtx-binding site in 18S rRNA in both a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free lysate and transfected COS-7 cells. The results showed that this oligonucleotide blocked expression mediated by the Gtx 5′ leader by ≈45% in the cell-free lysate (Fig. 2B) and ≈65% in transfected cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, expression remained unaffected in both the cell-free lysate and transfected cells upon exposure to the mutated Gtx-m1 oligonucleotide. In addition, in both systems, expression from a control RNA lacking Gtx elements was unaffected by the Gtx oligonucleotide. The control Gtx-m1 and Gtx-scrambled oligonucleotides had no effect on the expression of any of these constructs. Experiments performed using constructs containing full-length FGF2 5′ leader yielded similar results, with the Gtx oligonucleotide blocking expression by ≈40% in the cell-free lysate (Fig. 2B) and 55% in the transfected cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, expression of both pGtx/P and FGF2/P constructs was blocked by approximately the same amount by an oligonucleotide targeting the Gtx element in the mRNA (α-Gtx). In contrast, expression was unaffected by a mutated α-Gtx oligonucleotide (α-Gtx-m1; Fig. 2C). The control construct was unaffected by any of the oligonucleotides in both systems (data not shown). Ribonuclease protection assays showed that the reporter mRNA levels were unaffected in cells transfected with the various oligonucleotides, suggesting that the effects observed were not due to altered mRNA levels (Fig. 2, B and C). To further evaluate the specificity of the results, Gtx elements in the two 5′ leaders were disrupted by point mutations within the Gtx element (Fig. 3, A and C). The point mutation in the Gtx 5′ leader (in pGtx-mut/P) was known from earlier studies to block the activity of the Gtx-TEE (8Dresios J. Chappell S.A. Zhou W. Mauro V.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In these studies, this mutation reduced luciferase expression by ≈40% in transfected cells. For the FGF2 5′ leader, we introduced three point mutations to disrupt possible base pairing interactions to 18S rRNA because this 5′ leader contains a more extensive complementary match. These point mutations in the FGF2 5′ leader (in pFGF2-mut/P) reduced expression by 25%. The Gtx oligonucleotide did not affect expression from the mutated Gtx construct, similar to the controls (No oligonucleotide and Gtx-m1; Fig. 3B). Likewise, the Gtx oligonucleotide did not affect expression from the mutated FGF2 construct (Fig. 3D). Ribonuclease protection assays showed that the reporter mRNA levels were relatively unaffected in cells transfected with the various oligonucleotides, suggesting that the effects observed were not due to altered mRNA levels (Fig. 3, B and D). Evaluating Effects of Coding Sequences—To rule out possible nonspecific effects of the luciferase reporter cistron, we tested constructs containing both the Gtx and FGF2 5′ leader and coding sequences in COS-7 cells and evaluated expression by immunoblot analyses using anti-Gtx and anti-FGF2 antibodies, respectively. The results showed that each of these mRNAs produced several protein bands (Fig. 4, A and B). The two Gtx bands correspond to the full-length protein and a shorter product initiating from an in-frame AUG codon in the coding region. The FGF2 bands correspond to initiation from the initiation codon and three upstream CUG codons. In cells cotransfected with 1 μm of the Gtx oligonucleotide, levels of the Gtx and FGF2 proteins decreased. For Gtx, this decrease was even greater in the presence of 2 μm oligonucleotide. In contrast, the levels of these proteins were similar to those in control cells when cells were exposed to the mutated (Gtx-m1) oligonucleotide. Immunoblot analyses using an anti-β-actin antibody showed that the levels of endogenous β-actin were unaffected by the Gtx oligonucleotide, further suggesting that the effects of this oligonucleotide were specific. Assessing the Effects of Gtx and α-Gtx Oligonucleotides on the Proteome—The specificity of the Gtx and α-Gtx oligonucleotides was further evaluated by looking at their effects on the proteome. These effects were monitored by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the Gtx oligonucleotide. Cells were lysed, and proteins in these lysates were compared with those from untransfected COS-7 cells using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). Comparison of the gels showed that the overall pattern of proteins, as well as the relative levels of proteins, was highly similar. The SameSpots computer software was used to match and quantify protein spots between gels. When the gel containing proteins from untransfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 5A) was compared with the gel with protein from COS-7 cells transfected with the Gtx oligonucleotide (Fig. 5B), 12 of 196 spots showed a significant change in expression. In addition, when two-dimensional gels containing proteins from untransfected COS-7 cells were compared with those from cells transiently transfected with the Gtx-m1 and α-Gtx oligonucleotides (not shown), we found that five of these spots changed only with the Gtx and α-Gtx oligonucleotides, suggesting that the expression of these five proteins may involve base pairing interactions mediated by Gtx elements. The intensity (volume) of these spots was inhibited by 30–55% compared with the same spots from untransfected cells. These spots were picked from the two-dimensional gels, digested, and analyzed using a nano-LC/MS/MS method. We were able to identify proteins from two spots with >95% confidence as follows: vimentin (gi/75075845), an intermediate filament protein, and stomatin (gi/7305503), a component of lipid rafts. The 5′ leaders of the mRNAs encoding these proteins were analyzed for the presence of a Gtx element or elements. This analysis revealed that both the 186-nt vimentin 5′ leader and the 63-nt stomatin 5′ leader contain 7- and 6-nt contiguous matches to the Gtx element, respectively (supplemental Fig. 2). Our earlier studies showed that comparable matches were functional and could be as active or more active than the 9-nt element (6Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Dresios J. Chappell S.A. Zhou W. Mauro V.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Base pairing between mRNA and rRNA underlies the well established Shine-Dalgarno interaction in bacteria (27Shine J. Dalgarno L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar, 28Hui A. De Boer H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4762-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Our earlier analysis of the Gtx TEE indicated that similar base pairing interactions were not limited to bacteria but could also occur in eukaryotes (6Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Dresios J. Chappell S.A. Zhou W. Mauro V.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These earlier studies required testing the Gtx TEE as an isolated element, i.e. outside of the Gtx 5′ leader from which it was identified. This study now provides the first evidence that mRNA-rRNA base pairing can affect the translation of some mammalian mRNAs. In this study, we showed that oligonucleotides targeting either the Gtx-binding site in 18S rRNA or the Gtx TEE in the Gtx and FGF2 5′ leaders reduced translation from mRNAs containing these 5′ leaders. In addition, mRNAs in which the Gtx TEEs were mutated were translated less efficiently, suggesting that the Gtx TEE enhances translation in the Gtx and FGF2 mRNAs. Moreover, the mutated mRNAs were no longer affected by the Gtx oligonucleotide, indicating that the inhibitory effect of this oligonucleotide involved blocking the activity of the TEE. Antisense masking of the binding site in 18S rRNA enabled us to assess the contribution of the Gtx TEE in mRNAs without mutating, deleting, or otherwise modifying the mRNAs. This is an important advantage of the approach because any of these manipulations may themselves have nonspecific effects on expression, e.g. by affecting RNA conformation or altering the accessibility of other mRNA elements, including initiation codons (7Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18077-18082Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Such effects may underlie the results of a study in which deletion of a segment of the FGF2 5′ leader containing the Gtx TEE led to significantly decreased translation (11Bonnal S. Schaeffer C. Creancier L. Clamens S. Moine H. Prats A.C. Vagner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39330-39336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our findings, but various other mutations of the Gtx TEE or flanking nucleotides yielded inconsistent results. A limitation of the antisense masking approach is that it cannot distinguish between an mRNA element that binds to 18S rRNA or to another RNA. This is not a serious concern for the Gtx TEE because there is both biochemical as well as genetic evidence indicating that this element binds specifically to helix 26 of 18S rRNA and not to other factors (4Hu M.C.-Y. Tranque P. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, for a different mRNA element, additional evidence would be required to establish that the element is base pairing to rRNA. Ideally, one would perform experiments involving mutation of both mRNA and rRNA sequences to assess the requirement for an intact complementary match. Such a genetic approach was used to confirm the Shine-Dalgarno interaction in Escherichia coli (28Hui A. De Boer H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4762-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We used a similar approach in yeast to establish the Gtx interaction (8Dresios J. Chappell S.A. Zhou W. Mauro V.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although a suitable system for performing comparable studies in mammalian cells does not yet exist, we have undertaken studies in our laboratory to develop such a system. The oligonucleotides used in our studies did not appear to have global effects on the proteomes of cells transfected with them, as monitored by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. However, the levels of a small number of proteins did change specifically with the Gtx and α-Gtx oligonucleotides, suggesting that the translation of mRNAs encoding these proteins is affected by base pairing to the Gtx-binding site in 18S rRNA. Indeed, mass spectrometry of two proteins showing such a change revealed that the corresponding mRNAs contain matches to the Gtx element in their 5′ leaders, which provides a plausible explanation for the effects of Gtx and α-Gtx oligonucleotides. The changes observed in the levels of proteins affected by both the Gtx and α-Gtx oligonucleotides in COS-7 cells is consistent with the total number of mRNAs containing sequences complementary to the Gtx-binding site in 18S rRNA (<1%). The observation that numerous eukaryotic mRNAs contain sequences with complementarity to different sites in the 18S rRNA (e.g. see Refs. 1Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Appl. Bioinformatics. 2002; 1: 145-154PubMed Google Scholar) raises the possibility that the translation of a reasonably large number of eukaryotic mRNAs may be affected by base pairing to ribosomes. In contrast to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotes, which is located upstream of and in close proximity to the initiation codon, sequences with complementarity to rRNA in eukaryotic mRNAs are not restricted to the region located immediately upstream of the initiation codon but are found in all parts of mRNAs. Likewise, putative binding sites in 18S rRNA are not restricted to the 3′ end but are found throughout the molecule. This study provides the first evidence indicating that the translation efficiency of some natural mRNAs is affected by base pairing to the Gtx-binding site in 18S rRNA. In addition, this study provides an experimental approach for investigating putative mRNA-rRNA base pairing interactions in mammalian cells via the Gtx-binding site in 18S rRNA as well as through other possible binding sites.

https://openalex.org/W2088092837,"Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex required for the replication and protection of telomeric DNA in eukaryotes. Cells lacking telomerase undergo a progressive loss of telomeric DNA that results in loss of viability and a concomitant increase in genome instability. We have used budding yeast to investigate the relationship between telomerase deficiency and the generation of chromosomal translocations, a common characteristic of cancer cells. Telomerase deficiency increased the rate of formation of spontaneous translocations by homologous recombination involving telomere proximal sequences during crisis. However, telomerase deficiency also decreased the frequency of translocation formation following multiple HO-endonuclease catalyzed DNA double-strand breaks at telomere proximal or distal sequences before, during and after crisis. This decrease correlated with a sequestration of the central homologous recombination factor, Rad52, to telomeres determined by chromatin immuno-precipitation. This suggests that telomerase deficiency results in the sequestration of Rad52 to telomeres, limiting the capacity of the cell to repair double-strand breaks throughout the genome. Increased spontaneous translocation formation in telomerase-deficient yeast cells undergoing crisis is consistent with the increased incidence of cancer in elderly humans, as the majority of our cells lack telomerase. Decreased translocation formation by recombinational repair of double-strand breaks in telomerase-deficient yeast suggests that the reemergence of telomerase expression observed in many human tumors may further stimulate genome rearrangement. Thus, telomerase may exert a substantial effect on global genome stability, which may bear significantly on the appearance and progression of cancer in humans."

Outside of their conserved catalytic domains, known as Sec7 domains, little is known about Arf GEFs. Rsp5 is a yeast ubiquitin ligase that regulates numerous membrane trafficking events and carries a C2 domain that is specifically required for trans-Golgi network to vacuole transport.

In mammalian cells sorting at the TGN targets proteins for secretion, to apical or basolateral membranes, or to the lysosome. In yeast, proteins follow similar pathways, although the distinction between plasma membrane compartments does not exist and the intracellular destination is the lysosome-like vacuole. Many proteins involved in these trafficking pathways have been identified and characterized in yeast and are conserved in mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Gu F. Crump C.M. Thomas G. Cell Mol.

Some integral membrane cargos destined for the lysosome are modified with a monoubiquitin signal at the TGN by members of the Nedd4/Rsp5 family of ubiquitin ligases (reviewed in Refs. 4Hicke L.

Other integral membrane and luminal proteins do not require modification with ubiquitin for efficient trafficking from the TGN to the endosomal sorting pathway. However, the role of ubiquitin in sorting of these cargos within the endosomal pathway remains unclear (6Pak Y. Glowacka W.K. Bruce M.C. Pham N. Rotin D. J.

Ubiquitinated cargo is recognized at the Golgi by the ubiquitin-binding domains in GGA (Golgi localized, ;-ear containing, Arf-binding) proteins that sort TGN cargo into vesicles (reviewed in Ref. 3Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After leaving the TGN, cargo travels to the lysosome through a late endosomal compartment, known as the multivesicular endosome (MVE), where monoubiquitinated cargo is sorted into vesicles that bud into the MVE lumen. The MVE vesicles and their contents are then delivered in their entirety into the lumen of the lysosome (reviewed in Refs. 11Piper R.C. Katzmann D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Arf proteins are the small GTPases that regulate vesicle formation at the TGN (13Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Like other GTPases, Arf proteins are activated upon exchange of bound GDP for GTP in a reaction catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Arf activation by GEFs is a crucial regulatory step, because Arf must be in the GTP-bound state to recruit vesicle coat proteins to initiate vesicle budding (15Zhu Y. Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1323-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Toda K. Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Arf GEFs are characterized by having a catalytic Sec7 domain, first identified in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec7 protein (reviewed in Refs. 17Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E.

Sec7 is a large, essential, Golgi-associated Arf GEF required for the formation of transport vesicles from the TGN in yeast (19Achstetter T. Franzusoff A. Field C. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11711-11717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is localized primarily to TGN membranes (20Franzusoff A. Lauze E. Howell K.E. Nature. 1992; 355: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutations in Sec7 cause defects in the transport of a variety of cargo proteins from the Golgi to the vacuole, including proteins that travel by ubiquitin-independent and -dependent pathways (21Deitz S.B.

Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Sec7 has two mammalian homologues, BIG1 and BIG2, that primarily localize to the TGN to function in the release of vesicles from this organelle (reviewed in Ref. 23Shin H.W. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). BIG2 also localizes to the recycling endosome and is involved in organelle integrity (24Shin H.W. Morinaga N. Noda M. Nakayama K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5283-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Beyond the central catalytic domain, there are no characterized domains within Sec7, and little is known about the interactions and functions of the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein (21Deitz S.B.

Recently, regions of homology have been identified within BIG1 and BIG2 (reviewed in Ref. 18Casanova J.E. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These regions are sites of dimerization between BIG proteins and also interact with other binding partners (25Li H. Adamik R. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ubiquitin signals are attached to biosynthetic cargo traveling from the TGN to the lysosome by ubiquitin ligases, regulatory proteins that catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin to substrates (reviewed in Refs. 30Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 31d'Azzo A. Bongiovanni A. Nastasi T. Traffic. 2005; 6: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). One family of ubiquitin ligases that plays important roles in a variety of membrane trafficking processes is named for the mammalian Nedd4 and yeast Rsp5 proteins. Rsp5 is the sole S. cerevisiae member of the Nedd4/Rsp5 family; mammalian members include Nedd4–1, Nedd4–2, WWP1/AIP5, WWP2/AIP2, AIP4/Itch, Smurf1, and Smurf2. These ligases have a conserved domain structure, an N-terminal C2 domain, two to four central WW domains, and a C-terminal HECT (homologous to E6AP C terminus) catalytic domain (5Shearwin-Whyatt L. Dalton H.E. Foot N. Kumar S. Bioessays. 2006; 28: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr.

The function of the C2 domains in these ligases is ambiguous. C2 domains are found in proteins involved in vesicle trafficking, lipid modification, GTPase regulation, and protein phosphorylation (33Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J.

The C2 domains of Nedd4 and Smurf2 are important for interaction of these proteins with the plasma membrane (37Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol.

The Smurf2 C2 domain also plays an autoinhibitory function through binding to the HECT domain that inhibits autoubiquitination and substrate ubiquitination (42Wiesner S. Ogunjimi A.A. Wang H.R. Rotin D. Sicheri F. Wrana J.L. Forman-Kay J.D. Cell. 2007; 130: 651-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The Rsp5 C2 domain regulates trafficking in the late endocytic pathway at the MVE (43Dunn R. Klos D.A. Adler A.S. Hicke L. J.

Previously, we demonstrated that the Rsp5 C2 domain binds phosphoinositides (43Dunn R. Klos D.A. Adler A.S. Hicke L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), particularly PI(3)P, which is enriched on endosomal membranes (reviewed in Ref. 46Roth M.G. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 699-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Specific amino acids within the Rsp5 C2 domain that are required for PI(3)P binding are also required for the ubiquitination of cargo traveling from the TGN to the MVE, and thus for the sorting of this cargo into MVE vesicles (43Dunn R. Klos D.A. Adler A.S. Hicke L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To further understand the function of the Rsp5 C2 domain in TGN to vacuole trafficking, we screened for proteins that bind to and function with the C2 domain. Here we identify the Arf GEF Sec7 as an Rsp5 C2 domain-binding protein in vitro and in vivo, and we investigate the physical and functional characteristics of this interaction. Strains, Media, and Reagents—Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Yeast strains were propagated in rich medium (2% Bacto-peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose supplemented with 20 mg/liter adenine, uracil, and tryptophan) or selective minimal medium (47Sherman F.

Glick (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) and R. Piper (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), respectively. URA3-marked or LEU2-marked plasmids encoding GFP-carboxypeptidase S (CPS) were provided by S. Emr (University of California, San Diego, CA) or generated in our laboratory. 6D. A. Klos Dehring, W. Lin, and L. Hicke, unpublished data. All site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The yeast two-hybrid C2 domain bait vector (LHP2103) was constructed by PCR amplification of DNA encoding aa 1–142 of Rsp5, followed by insertion of the amplified fragment into the yeast two-hybrid GAL4-binding domain vector, pAS2-1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The 3K→Q (K75Q, K77Q, K78Q) mutation was introduced into the bait plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis (LHP2169). DNA encoding aa 1836–2009 of Sec7 was amplified from yeast genomic DNA and inserted into the pET-30 bacterial expression vector by ligation-independent cloning (Novagen, Madison, WI). Truncations and deletions of this fragment were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. The same method was used to construct plasmids encoding the C termini of BIG1 (aa 1665–1849, LHP2396), BIG2 (aa 1567–1785, LHP2378), and Gea1 (aa 1352–1408, LHP2353). Bacterial expression plasmids encoding GST-C2, GST-Sla1350–420, and GST-Rvs167SH3 have been described (43Dunn R. Klos D.A. Adler A.S. Hicke L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 50Stamenova S.D. Dunn R. Adler A.S. Hicke L. J. Biol.

DNA encoding the Itch C2 domain (aa 6–146, LHP2699) was amplified with terminal BglII sites and ligated into BamHI-digested pGEX-6P-2 (GE Healthcare). To construct an integrating plasmid for insertion of a C-terminal GFP tag into chromosomal SEC7, we amplified a fragment encoding Sec7 aa 1513–2009 from genomic DNA. This fragment was ligated into pUSE-URA3 (51Seron K. Tieaho V. Prescianotto-Baschong C. Aust T. Blondel M.-O. Guillaud P. Devilliers G. Rossanese O.W. Glick B.S. Riezman H. Keranen S.

Glick (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). The endogenous SpeI site was removed from the resulting plasmid and another SpeI site was introduced with silent mutations at the codons for aa 1722 and 1723 (LHP2505). An integrating plasmid to construct a chromosomally encoded GFP-tagged Sec7 lacking the C2 domain-interacting region, GFP-Sec7ΔCIR, was similarly made with the additional removal of DNA encoding aa 1836–1883 (LHP2507). To provide wild-type and sec7 mutant strains for the localization of Sys1-GFP, we constructed untagged SEC7 and sec7ΔCIR integrants. DNA encoding the GFP tag from LHP2505 and LHP2507 was removed by digestion with BamHI and EagI. The ends of the remaining large fragments of the plasmids were converted to blunt ends with T4 DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and the plasmids were ligated. A double stop codon was introduced after the codon for amino acid 2009 by site-directed mutagenesis resulting in plasmids encoding DNA to integrate untagged SEC7 (LHP2644) and untagged sec7ΔCIR (LHP2645). Plasmids were digested with SpeI and transformed into yeast. Replacement of the endogenous copy of SEC7 by homologous recombination was verified by PCR amplification of genomic DNA recovered from transformants. All mutations and plasmid sequences were verified by digestion and/or automated sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A plasmid encoding the binding domain of Gal4 fused to the Rsp5 C2 domain (LHP2103) was used to screen a yeast two-hybrid plasmid library (52James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast strain PJ69-4; was transformed with the yeast two-hybrid library and the strain PJ69-4A was transformed with LHP2103. The resulting transformants were mated and diploids were selected and transferred to minimal medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and adenine to select colonies exhibiting a positive interaction. Plasmids from these colonies were recovered and co-transformed with the original bait plasmid (LHP2103) and a bait plasmid carrying the 3K→Q mutations (LHP2169). Plasmids from colonies that exhibited a positive interaction with the wild-type bait plasmid a second time were sequenced. Recombinant Protein Purification and Binding Experiments— Hexahistidine (His6)-tagged and GST-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21-Codon Plus Escherichia coli (Stratagene) propagated in Luria broth supplemented with 40 mg/ml kanamycin, or with 100 mg/ml ampicillin and 20 mg/ml chloramphenicol, for plasmid maintenance. Recombinant protein expression was induced at 18 or 24 °C with 1 mm isopropyl ;-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma). Purification of His6-tagged proteins, purification of GST-tagged proteins, and binding experiments with these proteins were performed as previously described (43Dunn R. Klos D.A. Adler A.S. Hicke L.

For binding experiments with GFP-tagged C2 domain (GFP-C2) in yeast lysates, cells were harvested at a density of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml. Lysates were prepared by mechanical agitation with glass beads in MES buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitor mixture (0.2 ;g/ml chymostatin, 1 ;g/ml leupeptin, 2.5 ;g/ml antipain, 1 ;g/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h with 2 mg/ml ;-d-maltoside and 1% Triton X-100, cleared by centrifugation, and incubated with immobilized proteins as described for bacterial lysates. Lysates and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GFP as previously described (43Dunn R. Klos D.A. Adler A.S. Hicke L. J.

Native Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Cells (1.5 × 109) were harvested at a density of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml. Lysates for immunoprecipitation were prepared by mechanical agitation with glass beads in GFP IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitor mixture, 2 mg/ml ;-d-maltoside, and 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h and cleared by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C with GFP antibodies and Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Precipitated proteins were washed with GFP IP buffer and GFP IP wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% deoxycholate), resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Sec7-GFP) or nitrocellulose membranes (Rsp5), and analyzed by immunoblotting as previously described using anti-Rsp5 or anti-GFP (43Dunn R.

Cell. 2001; 12: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown to a density of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml and harvested at 4 °C. Cells were embedded in 1.67% low melt agarose (American Biorganics Inc., Niagra Falls, NY) on a slide and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DMIRE2 or Zeiss Axiovert 200M). For quantification of GFP-CPS sorting, cells with a detectable GFP signal were counted and binned into one of three groups based on the location of the GFP signal: group 1, vacuolar lumen (solid spot); group 2, limiting membrane of the vacuole (ring around the vacuole); or group 3, vacuolar lumen and limiting membrane (ring around the vacuole with diffuse internal fluorescence). For Sec7-GFP and Sys1-GFP images, cross-sections were taken along the z axis and projections were made using ImageJ version 1.34. Growth Suppression Analysis—Cells were transformed with an URA3-marked multicopy plasmid encoding SEC7 (YepTA65, Refs. 19Achstetter T. Franzusoff A. Field C. Schekman R. J. Biol.

For serial dilution growth assays, multiple transformants were grown overnight to stationary phase. Cells were serially diluted to 2 × 106, 2 × 105, 2 × 104, or 2 × 103 cells/ml and transferred in duplicate with an inoculating manifold to rich medium with or without 6 mm caffeine.

Using the intranasal route, this recombinant virus was 2 logs less virulent compared to the wildtype VACV-WR. Infection by the intranasal, intraperitoneal, and tail scarification routes resulted in the robust induction of cytolytic virus-specific CD8 T cells in the spleens and the lungs. VACV-specific antibodies were also detected in the sera of mice infected 3-5 months prior with the attenuated vGK5 virus. Finally, mice immunized with vGK5 were significantly protected when challenged with a lethal dose of VACV-WR.These results indicate that the attenuated vGK5 virus protects against subsequent infection and suggest that the N1L protein limits the strength of the early antiviral CD8 T cell response following respiratory infection."

In this form, it is able to enter mammalian cells to reach the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where, following toxin reduction, the RTA subunit is exported to the cytosol in a process that probably exploits some or all phases of the quality control pathway known as ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (2Romisch K.

Although a significant proportion of RTA is eventually degraded by proteasomes, a fraction appears to uncouple from this pathway to refold and inactivate substrate ribosomes (4Lord M.J. Jolliffe N.A.

This inactivation results from a specific depurination of 28 S rRNA at a site essential for the binding of elongation factors during protein synthesis (5Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol.

During the biosynthesis of ricin in the producing castor oil plant, the protein initially folds within the ER lumen. However, retro-translocation of RTA is avoided by the translation and ER segregation of an A-B precursor (proricin) that is incompetent for such a step (6Frigerio L. Roberts L. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1473-1480Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Instead, the ER-sequestered precursor is transported to vacuoles by virtue of a targeting signal that lies in a propeptide linking the two polypeptides. This internal sequence is removed by proteolysis only when proricin reaches the safe haven of storage vacuoles (7Frigerio L. Jolliffe N.A. Di Cola A. Felipe D.H. Paris N. Neuhaus J.M. Lord J.M.

In contrast, when RTA was co-expressed with RTB, where both nascent proteins contained an ER signal peptide, a disulfide-bonded holotoxin was generated and subsequently secreted from the cell (8Frigerio L. Vitale A. Lord J.M. Ceriotti A. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14194-14199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The presence, on one or other of the subunits, of the previously characterized vacuolar targeting sequence, directed this holotoxin to vacuoles in a route akin to that of the proricin precursor (7Frigerio L.

Frigerio L. Roberts L.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These findings clearly showed that co-expression of RTB with RTA allowed entry of both subunits into the secretory pathway and strongly mitigated the toxic effects observed with RTA alone. Indeed, the rescue effect of RTB suggested that this polypeptide lacked the propensity to retrotranslocate across the ER membrane. To test how ER quality control deals with an excess of RTB (made in the absence of its normal partner RTA), we have examined the fate of this solo subunit when made in tobacco cells. Surprisingly, we found that much of RTB, like ER-localized RTA, was degraded intracellularly. Unlike RTA, however, RTB did not emerge into the cytosol for degradation but disappeared within the early secretory pathway. The data presented suggest that the plant cell secretory pathway may contain an alternative proteolytic system for the disposal of misfolded/orphan proteins, as may also be the case in mammalian cells.

Construction of the RTB open reading frame preceded by an uncleavable saporin signal peptide was achieved by again using overlapping mutagenic PCR, using the primers 5′-CGTACGTATCTAGAATGAAGATATATGTTG-3′ and 5′-GATCCATACAAACATCAGCCACATCATTTGTTG-3′ to amplify the uncleavable saporin signal peptide 5′-CAACAAATGATGTGATATTCCCCAAACAATACC-3′ and the same fourth primer from above to amplify RTB, and the first and fourth of these primers to fuse the two overlapping segments together. Restriction enzyme sites are again underlined, and the fusion construct was again inserted into the XbaI-PstI sites of pDHA. Finally, RTB was cloned into the XbaI-SacI sites of the CaMV 35S cassette using the primers 5′-GCGCGCGTCTAGAGCTGATGTTTGTATG-3′ and 5′-TAATGATGGAGCTCTCAAAATAATGGTAACCA-3′ for subsequent insertion into EcoRV-cut pGreenII-0029, used for generation of transgenic tobacco plants. Restriction enzyme sites are underlined. Transient Transfection of Tobacco Leaf Protoplasts and Production of Transgenic Tobacco Plants—Protoplasts were prepared from axenic leaves (4–7 cm long) of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana SR1 (19Maliga P. Sz-Breznovits A. Marton L. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 244: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), or from transgenic plants where indicated, and were subjected to polyethylene glycol-mediated transfection with one or more plasmids as described previously (20Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. de Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformed with pGreenII-0029 encoding RTB under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and terminator was used to produce transgenic plants as described previously (20Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. de Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Pulse-Chase Analysis—Cells were radiolabeled with Pro-Mix (a mixture of [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine (GE Healthcare)) and chased for the times indicated in the figures, as described previously (8Frigerio L. Vitale A. Lord J.M. Ceriotti A. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14194-14199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In some experiments, before radioactive labeling, protoplasts were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in K3 medium (3.78 g/liter Gamborg's B5 basal medium with minimal organics, 750 mg/liter CaCl2·2H2O, 250 mg/liter NH4NO3, 136.2 g/liter sucrose, 250 mg/liter xylose, 1 mg/liter 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BAP), 1 mg/liter α-naphthaleneacetic acid) supplemented with either 36 μm brefeldin A (Sigma; 7 mm stock in 100% ethanol), 1 μm bafilomycin A (Sigma; 50 μm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide), or 5 mm 1-deoxymannojirimycin (Sigma; 0.2 m stock in sterile H2O). When indicated, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (Calbiochem; 20 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide) or epoxomycin (Calbiochem; 20 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to a concentration of 80 μm at the beginning of the labeling period. At the desired time points, 3 volumes of cold W5 medium (9 g/liter NaCl, 0.37 g/liter KCl, 18.37 g/liter CaCl2·2H2O, 0.9 g/liter glucose) were added, and protoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 60 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Separated or combined cells and media samples were frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 °C, unless further manipulations were to be performed as below. Protoplast Fractionation—Protoplast pellets (from 500,000 cells) were resuspended in 140 μl of 12% sucrose buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 12% (w/w) sucrose, supplemented immediately before use with Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and homogenized by pipetting 50 times with a Gilson-type micropipette through a 200-μl tip. Intact cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. 130 μl was loaded onto a 17% (w/w) sucrose pad and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Pellets (microsomes) and supernatants (cytosolic proteins) were frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 °C. Preparation of Protein Extracts and Immunoprecipitation— Frozen samples were homogenized by adding 2 volumes of cold protoplast homogenization buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, supplemented immediately before use with Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture). Homogenates were used for immunoprecipitation with polyclonal sheep anti-RTB, or polyclonal rabbit anti-RTA, anti-phaseolin (20Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. de Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), anti-BiP (20Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. de Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or anti-mouse IgG antisera (Sigma). To reduce any nonspecific immunoselection, anti-RTB and anti-phaseolin antisera were preincubated on ice for 2 h with unlabeled protoplast homogenate, before adding the radiolabeled samples. Immunoselected polypeptides were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, treated with Amplify™ (GE Healthcare), and radioactive polypeptides revealed by fluorography. Band intensity was determined using TotalLab 2003 software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK). Assays for Protein Aggregation and Extracellular Degradation—Where indicated, the incubation medium of protoplasts transfected with pDHA alone was spiked with commercially available RTB (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA; 50-ng per time point). Medium homogenates were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-RTB antiserum. Alternatively, protoplasts expressing RTB were subjected to immunoprecipitation in the presence or absence of anti-RTB antiserum, and unbound, nonimmunoprecipitable proteins trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and immunoblotted as above. ATP-release Assay—Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose beads carrying immunoprecipitated protein were washed once in ATP release buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 6 mm MgCl2), resuspended in 500 μl of ATP release buffer containing 8 mm ATP pH 7.5, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Lactose Precipitation of Functional RTB—Cell and medium homogenates were vortexed with a 10% (bead w/v) suspension of α-lactose immobilized onto agarose in NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40). After tumbling, the samples were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS-N buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40). Endoglycosidase H Treatment—Protein G-Sepharose beads carrying immunoprecipitated protein were resuspended in 20 μl of sodium citrate buffer (0.25 m sodium citrate pH 5.5, 0.2% (w/v) SDS) and boiled for 5 min. Supernatants were treated with 10 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science; 5 milliunits/μl stock) at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptide:N-Glycanase F Treatment—Protein G-Sepharose beads carrying immunoprecipitated protein were washed twice in sterile H2O, denatured by adding 28 μl of DNB buffer (0.5% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol), and boiled for 5 min. Supernatants were treated with 1000 units of peptide:N-glycanase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, at 37 °C for 1 h. A Substantial Proportion of Ricin B Chain Is Degraded within Tobacco Protoplasts—Tobacco protoplasts transfected with RTB-expressing plasmids were pulse-labeled for 1 h, and the newly synthesized proteins were subsequently chased with non-radioactive amino acids. The RTB present at each time point was recovered by immunoprecipitation (IP). As shown in Fig. 1A, a significant amount of cellular RTB was lost during the chase. Sequential IP of the initial supernatants revealed quantitative recovery in the first IP (data not shown), suggesting that disappearance was not related to the efficiency of IP. Although a proportion of RTB could be accounted for by secretion, the bulk of newly made RTB disappeared, presumably a result of proteolysis or aggregation. Because, in some instances, the fate of a protein may differ when expressed transiently or permanently in tobacco (21Frigerio L. de Virgilio M. Prada A. Faoro F. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we also monitored the fate of RTB constitutively expressed in transgenic plants. It is clear that in tobacco plants adapted to the stable expression of RTB, its rate of disappearance was very similar to that observed following transient transfection of protoplasts (compare Fig. 1, A and B) Indeed, from Fig. 1C it can be seen that up to 40% of the newly made RTB was unaccounted for by the end of a 5-h chase upon both transient expression in transfected protoplasts and upon stable expression in transgenic plants. During the chase, it was noticeable that RTB was converted to slightly smaller, faster migrating bands in both transiently transfected protoplasts (Fig. 1A) and in transgenic plants (Fig. 1B). RTB is glycosylated in plant cells, as shown by the in vitro treatment of samples with peptide:N-glycanase F (PNGaseF) following IP (Fig. 1D). Such treatment converted this protein (Fig. 1D, black arrowhead) to a single, faster migrating form with the molecular size of nonglycosylated RTB (white arrowhead). Conversely, treating cells with 1-deoxymannojirimycin (DMM), to inhibit the action of ER mannosidase I (22Vitale A. Zoppe M. Bollini R. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), caused the appearance of a slightly larger, sharper RTB band (Fig. 1D, asterisk). By comparison, the smaller bands observed in the absence of DMM suggested that the mannose-rich core glycans of RTB were being rapidly processed, even during the pulse. Together, these analyses showed that the reduction in RTB size seen during the chase was a result of glycan modification. Importantly, the RTB species with unprocessed glycans disappeared at approximately the same rate as glycosylated RTB, where loss in each case is measured relative to the amount present at the start of the chase. Inhibition of ER mannosidase is known to prolong the retention of misfolded glycoproteins within the calnexin cycle, thereby reducing their delivery to the proteasome (23de Virgilio M. Kitzmuller C. Schwaiger E. Klein M. Kreibich G. Ivessa N.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4059-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the unaltered kinetics seen here ±DMM strongly suggests that the calnexin cycle is not normally involved in the loss of RTB (23de Virgilio M. Kitzmuller C. Schwaiger E. Klein M. Kreibich G. Ivessa N.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4059-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). To rule out that the proportion of unaccounted lectin (Fig. 1C) was because of extracellular proteolysis, controls revealed that enzymes in the medium do not degrade RTB (Fig. 1E, left panel). Furthermore aggregation in vivo, to a form not recoverable by immunoprecipitation, was also excluded by immunoblotting denatured protein samples with or without prior removal of RTB by IP (Fig. 1E, right panel). Ricin B Chain Interacts with BiP in the ER Lumen—In Fig. 1, A and B, it was noticed that in cells expressing RTB, a band of ∼75 kDa was co-precipitated (shown by the asterisks). Because a protein could be selected from control cells using anti-BiP antibodies (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2) that was identical in size to that co-precipitated with anti-RTB antiserum (Fig. 2A, lane 5), this protein was tentatively identified as the ER chaperone BiP (the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein). The hallmark of a genuine BiP interaction is sensitivity to ATP, and this is indicated by the release of BiP from ATP-washed IPs (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Controls of the characterized chaperone-ligand interaction between BiP and immunoglobulin heavy chains in tobacco protoplasts (25Nuttall J. Vine N. Hadlington J.L. Drake P. Frigerio L. Ma J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6042-6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) are shown for comparison (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). BiP acts by binding newly made proteins to stabilize intermediates during protein folding and to prevent the formation of aggregates. This interaction, which can be transient or prolonged (26Nuttall J. Vitale A. Frigerio L. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), suggests that RTB may require assistance to reach its biologically active conformation. An excellent assessment of the conformation of the RTB lectin is its ability to interact with galactose (27Wales R. Richardson P.T. Roberts L.M. Woodland H.R. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19172-19179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B (lanes 4–6 and 11 and 12), a fraction of the expressed RTB could bind to immobilized lactose. Pulse-chase analysis confirmed that although the correctly folded RTB disappeared with time from the intracellular fractions, there was a concomitant appearance of the fully processed form in the medium (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, no BiP was detectable in association with the intracellular RTB population able to bind to lactose (note: the band at ∼60 kDa represents an unknown lactose-binding protein that is present in all lanes, including the controls). This finding supports the assertion that the fraction of RTB normally interacting with BiP (Fig. 2A) was in the process of folding but had not yet assumed its native, sugar-binding conformation. The secreted RTB is unlikely to be re-internalized (or to interact with cell surfaces) because plant cells lack β1,4-galactosyltransferase (28Bakker H. Bardor M. Molthoff J.W. Gomord V. Elbers I. Stevens L.H. Jordi W. Lommen A. Faye L. Lerouge P. Bosch D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2899-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Consequently, the characteristic galactose-containing complex N-glycans on glycoproteins that act as RTB receptors at the surface of mammalian cells are missing in plants. Vacuolar Degradation Is Not Responsible for the Loss of Ricin B Chain—The vacuole is a major site for the degradation of proteins in the secretory pathway of yeast (29Hong E. Davidson A. Kaiser C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Indeed, in plant cells, the central lytic vacuole is a major repository of proteolytic enzymes (30Carter C. Pan S. Zouhar J. Avila E.L. Girke T. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3285-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and is responsible for protein degradation during seed germination and autophagic processes (31Contento A.L. Kim S.J. Bassham D.C. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 2330-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). ER residents themselves may be constitutively transported to vacuoles, particularly when interactions with ligands are prolonged (32Tamura K. Yamada K. Shimada T. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant J. 2004; 39: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Pimpl P. Taylor J.P. Snowden C. Hillmer S. Robinson D.G. Denecke J. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 198-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether vacuolar degradation was responsible for the loss of RTB. The classical pathway to vacuoles involves transport from the ER via the Golgi complex, a process that can be disrupted in the presence of brefeldin A (BFA) (8Frigerio L. Vitale A. Lord J.M. Ceriotti A. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14194-14199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a reagent that has the same molecular target in plant cells as in other eukaryotes (34Nebenfuhr A. Ritzenthaler C. Robinson D.G. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We can reveal this pathway by biochemically visualizing changes that occur to the newly synthesized vacuolar protein phaseolin. This protein is known to be proteolytically processed into a characteristic set of low molecular weight fragments (20–25 kDa) upon arrival in the vacuoles of tobacco leaf cells (Fig. 3A) (21Frigerio L. de Virgilio M. Prada A. Faoro F. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The trafficking (and therefore processing) of phaseolin is blocked when cells are treated with BFA (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 14 and 15 with lanes 17 and 18), confirming previous observations (35Frigerio L. Pastres A. Prada A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1109-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that effective BFA treatment efficiently prevents the transport of this protein to the vacuole. BFA did not, however, have any stabilizing effect on RTB (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–6), although it did effectively block its secretion (Fig. 3A, lanes 11 and 12). The appearance of a slightly faster form of RTB in the presence of BFA by the end of the pulse (Fig. 3A, lane 4), and its processing during the chase (lanes 5 and 6) to a size that is comparable with the secreted RTB fraction in the absence of BFA (lanes 8 and 9), most likely arises from the exposure of ER-localized RTB to the full range of Golgi oligosaccharide-modifying enzymes that occurs when the Golgi stack collapses into the ER (20Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bielli A. de Virgilio M. Frigerio L. Pesca M. Faoro F. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To simplify quantitation of fuzzy glycosylated bands to assess the kinetics of degradation, we treated total RTB samples (i.e. combined cell and media fractions) with PNGaseF to remove PNGaseF-sensitive glycans from RTB (Fig. 3B). The higher molecular weight band seen in the chase samples in the absence of BFA, and denoted by a single asterisk, appears to represent RTB with a PNGaseF-resistant glycan (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3) (note that RTB has two glycans, but upon secretion from tobacco cells only one of these is PNGaseF-resistant). The only documented way in which a glycan gains PNGaseF resistance in plants is by fucosylation. Plant α1,3-fucosyltransferase is located in the late Golgi (36Saint-Jore-Dupas C. Faye L. Gomord V. Trends Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 317-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that the species of RTB acquiring PNGase-F resistance in the absence of BFA represents the fraction being secreted. The singly and doubly glycosylated PNGaseF-resistant forms present during the pulse and the chase in the presence of BFA, denoted by single and double asterisks (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–6), are likely to have been generated by Golgi-modifying enzymes present in the ER-Golgi hybrid compartment. By quantifying the combined bands in each lane, it is clear from the graph in Fig. 3B that RTB is not stabilized in the presence of BFA. Next, to show that RTB was not exiting the ER within COPII vesicles, we exploited knowledge that an overproduction of Sec12 can reduce ER export (16Phillipson B.A. Pimpl P. daSilva L.L. Crofts A.J. Taylor J.P. Movafeghi A. Robinson D.G. Denecke J. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2005-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Anterograde transport classically occurs in a COPII-dependent manner requiring the GTPase Sar1, the Sar1-specific guanosine nucleotide exchange factor Sec12, COPII coat components, and GTP (37d'Enfert C.
