Reductions in eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 2α phosphorylation trigger β-cell failure and diabetes. Salubrinal selectively inhibits eIF2α dephosphorylation, protects other cells against endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis, and has been proposed as a β-cell protector. Unexpectedly, salubrinal induced apoptosis in primary β-cells, and it potentiated the deleterious effects of oleate and palmitate. Salubrinal induced a marked eIF2α phosphorylation and potentiated the inhibitory effects of free fatty acids on protein synthesis and insulin release. The synergistic activation of the PERK-eIF2α branch of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, but not of the IRE1 and activating transcription factor-6 pathways, led to a marked induction of activating transcription factor-4 and the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP. Our findings demonstrate that excessive eIF2α phosphorylation is poorly tolerated by β-cells and exacerbates free fatty acid-induced apoptosis. This modifies the present paradigm regarding the beneficial role of eIF2α phosphorylation in β-cells and must be taken into consideration when designing therapies to protect β-cells in type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes develops in individuals who fail to compensate for insulin resistance by increasing pancreatic insulin output. This relative insulin deficiency results from pancreatic β-cell dysfunction (1Porte Jr., D. Kahn S.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S160-S163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or death (2Butler A.E. Janson J. Bonner-Weir S. Ritzel R. Rizza R.A. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3196) Google Scholar). Although genetic predisposition to the disease is an important risk factor, the rapid rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes over the past decades underscores the importance of environmental determinants in its pathogenesis (3Mann J.I. Lancet. 2002; 360: 783-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Western diets rich in saturated (animal) fats cause elevated plasma lipid levels. They are associated with obesity and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, thereby increasing the demand on pancreatic β-cells. Concomitantly, β-cells are exposed to increased levels of free fatty acids (FFA) 3The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acid(s); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; PERK, double-stranded RNA-activated kinase-like kinase; ATF, activating transcription factor; IRE1α, inositol requiring-1α; XBP-1, X-box-binding protein-1; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α; sal, salubrinal; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 3The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acid(s); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; PERK, double-stranded RNA-activated kinase-like kinase; ATF, activating transcription factor; IRE1α, inositol requiring-1α; XBP-1, X-box-binding protein-1; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α; sal, salubrinal; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. and other products, either of dietary origin or released from the enlarged fat depots. Chronic exposure to high concentrations of FFA causes β-cell apoptosis (4Cnop M. Welsh N. Jonas J.C. Jörns A. Lenzen S. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2005; 54: S97-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and may thus contribute to the increased β-cell apoptosis rates and progressive β-cell loss in type 2 diabetes (2Butler A.E. Janson J. Bonner-Weir S. Ritzel R. Rizza R.A. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3196) Google Scholar). We have recently proposed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is one of the molecular mechanisms implicated in FFA-induced pancreatic β-cell apoptosis (5Kharroubi I. Ladriere L. Cardozo A.K. Dogusan Z. Cnop M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5087-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), and this was confirmed by others (6Karaskov E. Scott C. Zhang L. Teodoro T. Ravazzola M. Volchuk A. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 7Wang H. Kouri G. Wollheim C.B. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3905-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). At approximately the same time, ER stress was proposed as a mechanism linking high fat diet-induced obesity with insulin resistance (8Ozcan U. Cao Q. Yilmaz E. Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Ozdelen E. Tuncman G. Gorgun C. Glimcher L.H. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2004; 306: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar). Alterations of normal ER function and environment lead to accumulation of unfolded proteins and activate a specific ER stress response, also known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (9Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). This ER stress response is mediated through three pathways under the control of the ER membrane proteins double-stranded RNA-activated kinaselike kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor (ATF)-6, and inositol requiring-1α (IRE1α), with the latter leading to splicing and activation of X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1). To decrease ER protein accumulation and recover ER function, the UPR: 1) attenuates translation via activation of PERK and subsequent phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) at Ser51; 2) increases the folding capacity of the ER by up-regulation of ER chaperones, such as BiP, via the transcription factors ATF-6 and XBP-1; and 3) degrades misfolded proteins via the ER-associated degradation pathway (10Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 5-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, when ER stress is prolonged or excessive, the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP and other components of the apoptotic machinery are activated (11Boyce M. Yuan J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The mechanisms linking ER stress and apoptosis remain incompletely understood (10Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 5-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Oakes S.A. Lin S.S. Bassik M.C. Curr Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Xu C. Bailly-Maitre B. Reed J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2656-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). Because of their high rate of protein synthesis, β-cells are particularly susceptible to changes in ER homeostasis (14Harding H.P. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Jungries R. Chung P. Plesken H. Sabatini D.D. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 15Scheuner D. Mierde D.V. Song B. Flamez D. Creemers J.W. Tsukamoto K. Ribick M. Schuit F.C. Kaufman R.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Regulation of mRNA translation via phosphorylation of eIF2α is crucial to maintain the integrity of the β-cell ER. Thus, homozygous mutations of PERK trigger β-cell death and diabetes in the human Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (16Delepine M. Nicolino M. Barrett T. Golamaully M. Lathrop G.M. Julier C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 17Senee V. Vattem K.M. Delepine M. Rainbow L.A. Haton C. Lecoq A. Shaw N.J. Robert J.J. Rooman R. Diatloff-Zito C. Michaud J.L.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1876-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and in a knock-out mouse model (14Harding H.P. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Jungries R. Chung P. Plesken H. Sabatini D.D. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Even a partial reduction in eIF2α phosphorylation, as in Eif2s1+/tm1Rjk mice heterozygous for an alanine substitution at Ser51, is sufficient to trigger β-cell failure and diabetes when coupled to a high fat diet (15Scheuner D. Mierde D.V. Song B. Flamez D. Creemers J.W. Tsukamoto K. Ribick M. Schuit F.C. Kaufman R.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). By screening small molecules that protect cells from ER stress, we have previously identified a selective inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation, named salubrinal (sal) (18Boyce M. Bryant K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ma D. Coen D.M. Ron D. Yuan J. Science. 2005; 307: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Sal, in concentrations ranging from 10 to 75 μm, protects the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC-12 against apoptosis induced by the ER stressors tunicamycin, brefeldin (18Boyce M. Bryant K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ma D. Coen D.M. Ron D. Yuan J. Science. 2005; 307: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) (present data). Based on these and previous observations (19Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 20Jousse C. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Lu P. Zhang Y. Harding H.P. Ron D. J.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that eIF2α phosphorylation is cytoprotective during ER stress. The susceptibility of pancreatic β-cells to ER stress and apoptosis induced by FFA (5Kharroubi I. Ladriere L. Cardozo A.K. Dogusan Z. Cnop M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5087-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 6Karaskov E. Scott C. Zhang L. Teodoro T. Ravazzola M. Volchuk A.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3905-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) but also by synthetic ER stress inducers and cytokines (23Cardozo A.K. Ortis F. Storling J. Feng Y.M. Rasschaert J. Tonnesen M. Van Eylen F. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Herchuelz A. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 24Pirot P. Eizirik D.L. Cardozo A.K. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) prompted us to explore potential therapies to modulate the β-cell response to ER stressors and increase its defense mechanisms. We presently evaluated the protective effects of sal against FFA-induced β-cell apoptosis. Unexpectedly, sal-induced eIF2α phosphorylation was proapoptotic in pancreatic β-cells, and it potentiated the deleterious effects of the FFA oleate and palmitate. Our findings, together with previous observations (19Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 20Jousse C. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Lu P. Zhang Y. Harding H.P. Ron D. J.

This modifies the present paradigm regarding the putative beneficial role of eIF2α phosphorylation in β-cells. Culture of Primary Autofluorescence-activated Cell Sorting-purified β-Cells and INS-1E Cells—Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories Belgium, Brussels, Belgium) were housed and used according to the guidelines of the Belgian Regulations for Animal Care. The Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of the Université Libre de Bruxelles approved the protocol. Rat islets were isolated by collagenase digestion followed by hand picking under a stereomicroscope. For β-cell isolation, the islets were dispersed, and the β-cells were purified by autofluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACStar; Becton Dickinson and Co., Sunnyvale, CA) (25Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van de Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 26Rasschaert J. Ladriere L. Urbain M. Dogusan Z. Katabua B. Sato S. Akira S. Gysemans C. Mathieu C. Eizirik D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33984-33991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The preparations used in the present experiments contained 87 ± 1% β-cells (n = 11). Purified β-cells were precultured overnight in Ham's F-10 medium with 10 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 0.5% charcoal-absorbed bovine serum albumin (BSA) (27Ling Z. Hannaert J.C. Pipeleers D. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). During FFA exposure, the cells were cultured in the same medium with 1% BSA and no serum. The rat insulin-producing INS-1E cell line (a kind gift from Prof. C. Wollheim, Centre Medical Universitaire, Geneva, Switzerland) was cultured in RPMI 1640 (with GlutaMAX-I) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 1mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (28Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) for 48 h prior to FFA exposure. The PC-12 cell line was cultured in F-12K Nutrient Mixture Kaighn's modification medium supplemented with 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Oleate and palmitate (sodium salt; Sigma) were dissolved in 90% ethanol, heated to 60 °C, and used in a 1:100 dilution (at a final concentration of 0.5 mm) in RPMI 1640 with 1% BSA and 1% fetal calf serum (5Kharroubi I. Ladriere L. Cardozo A.K. Dogusan Z. Cnop M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5087-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 29Cnop M. Hannaert J.C. Hoorens A. Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G.

Sal and derivative-3 were dissolved in Me2SO. The control condition contained similar dilutions of ethanol and Me2SO as appropriate. Assessment of β-Cell Viability—The percentage of viable, apoptotic, and necrotic cells was determined after 12-72 h of exposure to sal with or without FFA. Autofluorescence-activated cell sorting-purified β- and INS-1E cells were incubated for 15 min with the DNA binding dyes propidium iodide (5 μg/ml; Sigma) and Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml; Sigma), as previously described (5Kharroubi I. Ladriere L. Cardozo A.K. Dogusan Z. Cnop M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5087-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 31Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Kloppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This method is quantitative and has been validated by systematic comparison with electron microscopy (31Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Kloppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) or determination of DNA strand breaks (5Kharroubi I. Ladriere L. Cardozo A.K. Dogusan Z. Cnop M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5087-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Western Blot Experiments—For Western blot analysis of eIF2α phosphorylation on serine 51 residue (P-eIF2α) or total eIF2α, used as a loading control, 5 × 104 FFA-treated INS-1E cells were lysed in 15 μl of whole cell extract buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm MgCl2, 1mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1mm Na3VO4, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 15 min. The total cell lysates of two duplicate wells were pooled and centrifuged (15 min at 14,000 rpm), and the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. For the detection of ATF-4 and CHOP protein, 5 × 105 cells were collected in icecold phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and lysed by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. The protein samples were separated on 10-12% SDS/PAGE gels, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Biosciences), and probed with rabbit antibodies against P-eIF2α (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), eIF2α (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), ATF-4 (1:2500 dilution; anti-CREB-2/ATF4 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GADD153/CHOP (1:250 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich), or β-actin (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling) as primary antibodies and a horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:3000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as secondary antibody. The proteinspecific signals were detected using chemiluminescence, quantified using Biomax1D image analysis software (Kodak), and expressed as optical densities. The membranes were reused after stripping the primary antibody by incubation in 2% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 50 °C in a shaking water bath. Measurement of Protein Biosynthesis—For the measurement of protein synthesis in INS-1E cells, 6 × 104 cells were treated with sal and/or FFA for 12-48 h. The last 2 h of the incubations were performed in 200 μl of Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 1% BSA, 11 mm glucose, sal, and/or FFA and 10 μCi/ml l-(4,5-3H)-leucine (NET135H; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Excess nonincorporated [3H]leucine was removed by washing five times with Hanks' solution containing 10 mm nonradioactive l-leucine. The cells were extracted in 1 ml of buffer (11% acetic acid in water with 0.25% BSA), and the proteins were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid. The content of 3H-labeled protein was determined by measuring the radioactivity using a liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard, Meriden, CT) (32Eizirik D.L. Autoimmunity. 1991; 10: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein biosynthesis in INS-1E cells exposed to salubrinal for 24-48 h was expressed per total protein content, measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay and protein assay standard II (Bio-Rad GmbH, Munchen, Germany), to correct for differences in cell number in the experimental conditions. Insulin Measurements—β-Cell insulin release to the medium over a 24-72-h culture period was measured as previously described (33Leclercq-Meyer V. Marchand J. Woussen-Colle M.C. Giroix M.H. Malaisse W.J. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 34Valverde I. Barreto M. Malaisse W.J. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1443-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, an anti-insulin antibody and 125I-labeled insulin were added to the medium and incubated for 48-72 h at 4 °C. Two ml of a charcoal-dextran suspension was added to separate the antibody-insulin complex. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 25 min. The radioactive content of the pellet was examined in a γ-counter. Insulin content was determined on acid ethanolextracted INS-1E cells and expressed per total protein content. Analysis of ER Stress Markers mRNA Expression by Real Time PCR—Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from INS-1E cells and reverse transcribed as previously described (35Chen M.C. Proost P. Gysemans C. Mathieu C. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The real time PCR amplification reaction was done in a volume of 20 μl containing 2.5-5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm forward and reverse primers, 2 μl of SYBR Green PCR master mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and 2 μl of cDNA. Standards for each gene were prepared using appropriate primers in a conventional PCR. The samples were assayed on a LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Science), and their concentrations were calculated as number of copies using the standard curve approach (36Overbergh L. Valckx D. Waer M. Mathieu C. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The expression level of the gene of interest was corrected for that of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The specific primers for spliced XBP-1 were F 5′-GAGTCCGCAGCAGGTG-3′ and R 5′-GCGTCAGAATCCATGGGA-3′; for GADD34 they were F 5′-AGGGATGTGGAGAAGCAGAG-3′ and R 5′-AAAGATCTGAGCCGCTTCTG-3′, yielding PCR fragments of 65 and 123 bp, respectively. The sequence of GAPDH, CHOP, ATF-4, total XBP-1, and BiP primers have been reported elsewhere (5Kharroubi I. Ladriere L. Cardozo A.K. Dogusan Z. Cnop M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5087-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 24Pirot P. Eizirik D.L. Cardozo A.K. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Analysis of UPR Promoter Activity—To evaluate the functionality of the transcriptional activation of the IRE1 and ATF-6 pathways by sal and FFA, we used an UPRE luciferase reporter construct kindly provided by Prof. Prywes (Columbia University, New York, NY). This element functions as binding site for both XBP-1 (37Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2869) Google Scholar) and ATF-6 (38Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). INS-1E cells were cotransfected with this luciferase reporter construct and with pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI) as internal control using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (39Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were assayed with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as previously described (39Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 40Kutlu B. Darville M.I. Cardozo A.K. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Comparisons were performed by two-sided paired or ratio t test or by analysis of variance followed by paired t test with the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Salubrinal Does Not Protect β-Cells from ER Stress—In a first series of experiments we confirmed that sal protects the pheochromocytoma cell line PC-12 from ER stress-mediated apoptosis induced by the SERCA 2 blockers thapsigargin and CPA. In good agreement with previous findings (18Boyce M. Bryant K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ma D. Coen D.M. Ron D. Yuan J. Science. 2005; 307: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), sal (75 μm) reduced thapsigargin- or CPA-mediated apoptosis in PC-12 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Sal per se was not toxic to PC-12 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). We next examined whether sal protects β-cells from ER stress. At variance with the PC-12 cells, sal exerted a dose-dependent pro-apoptotic effect on insulin-producing INS-1E cells (Fig. 1A) and primary β-cells (Fig. 1B), whereas derivative-3 (an inactive analogue of sal, which does not induce eIF2α phosphorylation) (18Boyce M. Bryant K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ma D. Coen D.M. Ron D. Yuan J. Science. 2005; 307: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar) did not affect β-cell viability after 72 h. Sal toxicity in INS-1E cells was already detectable after 24 h (supplemental Fig. S2). Again in contrast to the PC-12 cells, sal did not protect primary β-cells or INS-1E cells from the synthetic ER stress inducers CPA or thapsigargin (supplemental Fig. S2). Neither was protection observed against the combination of cytokines interleukin-1β and interferon-γ, previously shown to cause β-cell ER stress (23Cardozo A.K. Ortis F. Storling J. Feng Y.M. Rasschaert J. Tonnesen M. Van Eylen F. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Herchuelz A. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 24Pirot P. Eizirik D.L. Cardozo A.K. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the contrary, sal induced a minor increase in cytokine-induced apoptosis in primary β- and INS-1E cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Salubrinal Synergizes with FFA to Induce β-Cell Apoptosis—We have previously shown that the FFA oleate and palmitate induce ER stress and apoptosis in β-cells, by mechanisms different from cytokines and synthetic ER stress inducers (5Kharroubi I.

Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1771-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether sal protects β-cells against FFA-induced apoptosis. Exposure of INS-1E (Fig. 1C) or primary β-cells (Fig. 1D) to oleate or palmitate in the presence of sal unexpectedly potentiated the pro-apoptotic effect of the FFA. The inactive compound derivative-3 did not affect FFA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1). The potentiating effect of sal was most marked for oleate, augmenting cell death after 72 h by 4.5- and 3-fold in INS-1E and primary β-cells, respectively, as compared with oleate alone. This effect was already detected in INS-1E cells within 12-24 h of exposure, increasing oleate-induced apoptosis more than 3-fold in the presence of sal (after 24 h; supplemental Fig. S3). Following these short term exposures, no additive effect was observed between sal and palmitate (supplemental Fig. S3). No potentiation was seen with the nonmetabolizable fatty acid methyl-oleate, which is not toxic to β-cells. The percentage of apoptosis in INS-1E cells following a 72-h exposure to methyl-oleate (0.5 mm) plus sal (75 μm) did not exceed that observed with sal alone (data not shown). On the other hand, an equimolar mixture of oleate and palmitate, which is not toxic per se (29Cnop M. Hannaert J.C. Hoorens A. Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1771-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 41Maedler K. Oberholzer J. Bucher P. Spinas G.A. Donath M.Y. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), became highly pro-apoptotic in the presence of sal (57 ± 12% INS-1E cell apoptosis for the FFA mixture with sal versus 3 ± 1% without sal; p < 0.01, n = 6). Similarly, sal increased the percentage of apoptotic primary β-cells from 15 ± 2% to 91 ± 2% (both after 72 h in the presence of 0.5 mm oleate plus palmitate 1:1, p < 0.001, n = 4). In all of the above described experiments apoptosis was the main mode of cell death, with a negligible necrotic component (data not shown). Because the potentiation of FFA-induced apoptosis by sal was similar in primary β-cells and well differentiated INS-1E cells and taking into account the large number of cells required, we performed most of the subsequent experiments to elucidate the mechanisms underlying sal effects in INS-1E cells. Salubrinal Synergizes with FFA to Activate the eIF2α Branch of the UPR in β-Cells—Sal is a selective inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation (18Boyce M. Bryant K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P.

Two members of the human tissue kallikrein (KLK) family of (chymo)tryptic-like serine proteases, KLK5 and KLK7, are implicated in desquamation by digestion of (corneo)desmosomes and inhibition by desquamation-related serine protease inhibitors (SPIs). However, the epidermal localization and specificity of additional KLKs also supports a role for these enzymes in desquamation. This study aims to delineate the probable contribution of KLK1, KLK5, KLK6, KLK13, and KLK14 to desquamation by examining their interactions, in vitro, with: 1) colocalized SPI, lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI, four recombinant fragments containing inhibitory domains 1–6 (rLEKTI(1–6)), domains 6–8 and partial domain 9 (rLEKTI(6–9′)), domains 9–12 (rLEKTI(9–12)), and domains 12–15 (rLEKTI(12–15)), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, and elafin and 2) their ability to digest the (corneo)desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein 1.

Only KLK5 was inhibited by rLEKTI(12–15) (Ki = 21.8 nm). No KLK was inhibited by secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor or elafin. Apart from KLK13, all KLKs digested the ectodomain of desmoglein 1 within cadherin repeats, Ca2+ binding sites, or in the juxtamembrane region. Our study indicates that multiple KLKs may participate in desquamation through cleavage of desmoglein 1 and regulation by LEKTI.

In addition to LEKTI, the skin contains other SPIs that may regulate desquamation and KLK activity. KLK7 is inhibited by two members of the trappin (transglutaminase substrate and wap (whey acid protein) domain containing protein) gene family, namely secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI; also known as antileukoprotease) and elafin (also referred to as proteinase inhibitor 3 and skin-derived antileukoprotease (SKALP)) (41Franzke C.W.

Although the (chymo)trypsin-like substrate specificity and epidermal localization of many KLKs other than KLK5 and KLK7 are compatible with a function in the terminal stages of epidermal turnover, their role as desquamatory proteases has not been investigated. Thus, in an attempt to delineate the possible involvement of multiple KLKs in desquamation, this study examines the interactions between KLK1, KLK5, KLK6, KLK13, and KLK14 with: 1) epidermal SPI (LEKTI, SLPI, and elafin/SKALP) and 2) the (corneo)desmosomal cadherin DSG1, in vitro.

Proteases (final concentration of 12 nm for KLK1, KLK5, KLK13, KLK14, and NE or 30 nm for KLK6) were preincubated with LEKTI fragments (0–60 nm), SLPI (0–1.2 μm), and/or elafin (0–1.2 μm) in 10 μl of optimal buffer at 25 °C (for LEKTI reactions) or 37 °C (for SLPI and elafin reactions) with gentle agitation for different time points (10 min for KLK1 and KLK6, 5 min for KLK6, 1 min for KLK5, and 10 s for KLK14 with LEKTI fragments; 30 min for KLK1, KLK6, and KLK13, 5 min for KLK6 and KLK14, and 1 min for NE with SLPI and elafin). The mixtures were subsequently added to 90 μl of optimal buffer containing several fixed AMC peptide concentrations ranging from 4 to 3000 μm within polystyrene microtiter plate wells. Initial rates of protease-mediated peptide hydrolysis were monitored by measuring free AMC fluorescence on the Wallac 1420 Victor2TM fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation and emission filters of 380 and 480 nm, respectively, at 1-min intervals for 20 min at 37 °C. Protease-free reactions, for each substrate concentration, were used as negative controls, and the background counts obtained were subtracted from each value. A standard curve was constructed using known concentrations of AMC to convert rates of reaction from AMC fluorescence counts/min to free AMC produced/min. The slope of the resultant AMC standard curve was 19.184 AMC fluorescence counts/nm AMC. The rate changes (nanomolar AMC/min) of inhibited and control reactions were determined from the velocity plots. Activities were expressed relative to control incubations from which inhibitors were excluded. Average IC50 values, i.e. the inhibitor concentration required for 50% inhibition of protease activity, were determined by non-linear regression analysis using Prism (Version 4.0, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Michaelis-Menten parameters (Km and Vmax), the equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki), and inhibitory mechanisms were determined by linear and non-linear regression analysis using the Enzyme Kinetics Module 1.1 (Sigma Plot, SSPS, Chicago, IL). All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. In Vitro Digestion of LEKTI and SLPI by KLKs—LEKTI (10 ng) or SLPI (500 ng) were incubated separately with KLK1, KLK5, KLK6, KLK13, and KLK14 (1 ng for LEKTI reactions; 50 ng for SLPI reactions) in a final optimal buffer volume of 20 μl for different time points ranging from 0 to 24 h at 37 °C with shaking. Control reactions, i.e. KLKs, LEKTI, and SLPI incubated alone, were also performed. Reactions were terminated by freezing in liquid nitrogen and were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE using the NuPAGE Bis-Tris electrophoresis system and 4–12% gradient pre-cast polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions at 200 V for 45 min (Invitrogen). For KLK-SLPI reactions, protein mixtures were visualized by silver staining with the Silver Xpress kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For KLK-LEKTI reactions, proteins were transferred to Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) at 30 V for 1 h, blocked in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (TBS-T; 0.1 mol/liter Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 mol/liter NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C and probed with anti-LEKTI monoclonal antibody 1C11G6 (for rLEKTI(1–6), -(6–9′), and -(9–12)) or 1D6G8 (for rLEKTI(12–15)), both diluted 1:1,000 in TBS-T, for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times for 15 min with Tris-buffered saline-Tween and treated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000 in Tris-buffered saline-Tween; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were washed again as above, and fluorescence was detected on x-ray film using a chemiluminescent substrate (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA).

https://openalex.org/W1985563243,"The hepatitis B virus infects more than 350 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of liver cancer. The virus encodes a multifunctional regulator, the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), that is essential for virus replication. HBx is involved in modulating signal transduction pathways and transcription mediated by various factors, notably CREB that requires the recruitment of the co-activators CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300. Here we investigated the role of HBx and its potential interaction with CBP/p300 in regulating CREB transcriptional activity. We show that HBx and CBP/p300 synergistically enhanced CREB activity and that CREB phosphorylation by protein kinase A was a prerequisite for the cooperative action of HBx and CBP/p300. We further show that HBx interacted directly with CBP/p300 in vitro and in vivo. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we provide evidence that HBx physically occupied the CREB-binding domain of CREB-responsive promoters of endogenous cellular genes such as interleukin 8 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Moreover expression of HBx increased the recruitment of p300 to the interleukin 8 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoters in cells, and this is associated with increased gene expression. As recruitment of CBP/p300 is known to represent the limiting event for activating CREB target genes, HBx may disrupt this cellular regulation, thus predisposing cells to transformation."

The RAGE-calgranulin C interaction mediates a pro-inflammatory response to cellular stress and can contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory lesions. The soluble extracellular part of RAGE (sRAGE) was shown to decrease the inflammation response possibly by scavenging RAGE-activating ligands. Here, by using high resolution NMR spectroscopy, we identified the sRAGE-calgranulin C interaction surface. Ca2+ binding creates two symmetric hydrophobic surfaces on Ca2+-calgranulin C that allow calgranulin C to bind to the C-type immunoglobulin domain of RAGE. Apo-calgranulin C also binds to sRAGE using a completely different surface and with substantially lower affinity, thus underscoring the role of Ca2+ binding to S100 proteins as a molecular switch. By using native gel electrophoresis, chromatography, and fluorescence spectroscopy, we established that sRAGE forms tetramers that bind to hexamers of Ca2+-calgranulin C.

This arrangement creates a large platform for effectively transmitting RAGE-dependent signals from extracellular S100 proteins to the cytoplasmic signaling complexes. Calgranulin C (S100A12) is one of 21 members of the S100 family of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins identified to date (1Heizmann C.W. Fritz G. Schafer B.W. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: D1356-D1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the S100 family have both intracellular and extracellular functions and participate in diverse cellular processes leading to cell growth and differentiation, cell cycle regulation, transcription, and signal transduction receptor activities (2Donato R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 60: 540-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). This diversity is tailored in part by a distinct pattern of subcellular localization and tissue-specific expression. EF-hand calcium-binding proteins translate the physiological changes in calcium levels into specific cellular responses by undergoing a large conformational change that exposes a binding site recognized by downstream effectors, essentially acting as a molecular switch (3Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 4Bhattacharya S. Bunick C.G. Chazin W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Most S100 proteins are noncovalent homodimers. Some members of the S100 family, such as S100A8 and S100A9, form heterodimers and heterotetramers (5Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol.

Lukanidin E. Bronstein I.B. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 60: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The basic structural and functional unit of the S100 proteins is a symmetric dimer comprised of two EF-hand subunits organized into an eight-helix bundle (4Bhattacharya S. Bunick C.G. Chazin W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The conformational change triggered by calcium binding asymmetrically affects the two EF-hand motifs of the subunit with the N-terminal EF-hand undergoing a relatively small change in conformation, whereas the change in the C-terminal EF-hand is much larger.This conformational rearrangement creates a shallow hydrophobic pocket. Structural studies of the ligated forms of S100 proteins showed that this hydrophobic surface can bind short peptides from the respective targets of S100 proteins (9Bhattacharya S. Large E.

Surprisingly, despite utilizing a similar binding surface, different peptides bind to individual S100 proteins in different ways. For example, in the complexes determined by using x-ray crystallography involving S100A10 and a peptide from annexin II (10Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and S100A11 and a peptide from annexin I (11Rety S. Osterloh D. Arie J.P. Tabaries S. Seeman J. Russo-Marie F. Gerke V. Lewit-Bentley A. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the peptide is packed against helices 1 and 4 of S100A10. However, in the complexes determined using NMR involving S100B and the peptide from p53 (13Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), the p53 peptide makes contacts with helices 3 and 4, and in the complex between S100B and the peptide from NDR (nuclear Dbf2-related) kinase (9Bhattacharya S. Large E. Heizmann C.W. Hemmings B. Chazin W.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14416-14426Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the NDR peptide is mostly packed against helix 4. The observed structural differences suggest that the binding modes may be still different for the full-length S100 protein targets.The crystal structure of Ca2+-bound calgranulin C closely resembles structures of the S100/calgranulin family proteins, presenting a dimer of four-helix subunits (14Moroz O.V. Antson A.A. Murshudov G.N. Maitland N.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Skibshoj I. Lukanidin E.M. Bronstein I.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The calciumbinding EF-hand motifs, helix 1-loop 1-helix 2 and helix 3-loop 3-helix 4 are linked by a short anti-parallel β-bridge, a common feature of the EF-hand proteins. Helices 2 and 3 are linked by the hinge region formed by loop 2. The hinge region is poorly conserved among S100 family members suggesting that specificity of target recognition may reside in this area. At low millimolar concentrations of Ca2+, calgranulin C can also form a hexamer consisting of three symmetrically positioned Ca2+-bound dimers (6Moroz O.V. Antson A.A. Dodson E.J. Burrell H.J.

The mechanism by which calgranulin C modulates the course of inflammatory processes is related to its interaction with the receptor for advanced glycated products (RAGE) 2The abbreviations used are: RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation products; sRAGE, soluble RAGE; AGE, advanced glycation product; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; PDB, Protein Data Bank; TNS, 6-(p-toluidino)naphthalene-2-sulfonate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. 2The abbreviations used are: RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation products; sRAGE, soluble RAGE; AGE, advanced glycation product; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; PDB, Protein Data Bank; TNS, 6-(p-toluidino)naphthalene-2-sulfonate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase.

Based on sequence homology, RAGE contains an N-terminal V-type immunoglobulin domain followed by two C-type immunoglobulin domains, a trans-membrane helix and short cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail is absolutely essential for intracellular signaling. A RAGE mutant lacking a cytoplasmic tail, dominant negative-RAGE, exhibits a strong dominant negative effect on RAGE-dependent signaling (15Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C.

A recent study revealed that ERK kinase binds directly to a site on the RAGE cytoplasmic tail suggesting its essential role in RAGE-mediated signaling (20Ishihara K. Tsutsumi K. Kawane S. Nakajima M. Kasaoka T.

Rather than working as a scavenger receptor to effectively uptake and dispose of AGEs, ligand-active RAGE causes cellular perturbations leading to an inflammatory response (22Wautier J.L. Zoukourian C. Chappey O. Wautier M.P. Guillausseau P.J. Cao R. Hori O. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The extracellular, naturally occurring splicing variant of RAGE, soluble RAGE (sRAGE) that includes three immunoglobulin domains (17Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was shown to alleviate the inflammatory effects resulting from the AGEs-RAGE interaction by sequestering RAGE-activating ligands (23Park L.

Calgranulin C binding to RAGE mediates the activation of endothelial cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes, cells central to the inflammatory response. By using specific inhibitors of different signaling pathways, it was found that phospholipase C, protein kinase C, Ca2+ fluxes, calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) are required for extracellular calgranulin C to initiate signal transduction through RAGE (25Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Besides S100 family proteins, a small protein shown to be involved in tumor growth, HMGB1, was also identified as a RAGE ligand (26Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J.X. Nagashima M.

Biochemical characterization of RAGE-ligand interactions was limited to in vitro binding studies, which revealed that the N-terminal V domain of RAGE is involved in binding AGEs (27Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Stern D.M. Circulation. 1997; : 37PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that the binding of AGEs to RAGE inhibited calgranulin C binding to RAGE (15Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C. Kambham N. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Neurath M.F. Slattery T. Beach D. McClary J. Nagashima M. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M.

We showed that hexameric Ca2+-calgranulin C binding to sRAGE is mediated by the first C-type immunoglobulin-type domain of tetrameric RAGE, C1. Interaction surface mapping studies reveal that the apo-form of calgranulin C also binds to RAGE with comparatively low affinity, using a surface that is substantially different from the surface participating in the high affinity Ca2+-calgranulin C-RAGE interaction. These calciumdependent interactions substantiate the idea that Ca2+ binding is the trigger for a molecular switch that transmits structural rearrangements through the trans-membrane domain to the cytosolic tail of RAGE leading to signal transduction through the RAGE receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—DNA coding for human sRAGE (amino acids 24-336), V domain (amino acids 24-129), C1 domain (amino acids 130-234), C2 domain (amino acids 235-336), VC1 domains (amino acids 24-234), and C1C2 domains (amino acids 130-336) was PCR-amplified from the human cDNA library (GenBank™ accession number BC020669) using Taq polymerase and oligonucleotides containing flanking 5′-NdeI and 3′-SalI restriction sites. DNA coding for full length human HMGB1 was PCR-amplified from the human cDNA library (GenBank™ accession number BC066889) using Taq polymerase and oligonucleotides containing flanking 5′-NcoI and 3′-SalI restriction sites. The restriction-digested PCR products of RAGE were ligated into the NdeI and SalI sites of expression vector pET28a (Novagen), and the restriction digested PCR product of HMGB1 was ligated into the NcoI and SalI sites of expression vector pRSF-1b (Novagen). Both plasmids confer kanamycin resistance. The resulting plasmids pET28sRAGE, pET28V, pET28C1, pET28C2, pET28VC1, and pET28C1C2 express cleavable, C-terminal His-tagged proteins. pRSF-HMGB1 plasmid expresses full-length human HMGB1 without additional tags.Expression and Purification of sRAGE and RAGE Domains—Plasmids expressing sRAGE or RAGE domains were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) Codon+ (Novagen) for overexpression and purification. Cells were grown to ∼0.7 A600 at 37 °C in LB containing 35 mg/liter kanamycin, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown overnight. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) containing 8 m urea and heat-lysed at 95 °C for 10 min. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant loaded onto a His tag column. The column was washed with 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.0), and the protein was allowed to renature on the column prior to eluting with 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 500 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the eluted protein were pooled, dialyzed into 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, concentrated to 0.2-0.5 mm, and loaded onto a Sephadex 200 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. Fractions containing the eluted protein were pooled and concentrated to 0.3-1.0 mm using centricones (Millipore). All concentrations cited for sRAGE and its domains refer to total monomer concentration. Purity was estimated to be >90% by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE.Expression and Purification of HMGB1—Plasmid expressing full-length human HMGB1, pRSF-HMGB1, was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) Codon+ (Novagen) for overexpression and purification. Cells were grown to ∼0.7 A600 at 37 °C in LB containing 35 mg/liter kanamycin and induced for 3 h with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated on ice for 10 min. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (Sigma) equilibrated in the same buffer. The flow-through fraction of supernatant was collected and mixed with solid ammonium sulfate (50% of maximum solubility at 0 °C). The supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-NaOH (pH 8.0) and loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. Protein was eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) to 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl over 30 min. Fractions containing the eluted protein were pooled, dialyzed into NMR buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3), and concentrated to 0.3-1.0 mm using centricones (Millipore). Purity was estimated to be >90% by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE.Labeling, Expression, and Purification of Calgranulin C—Human calgranulin C (S100A12; amino acids 1-92) was expressed using pQE60calC (14Moroz O.V. Antson A.A. Murshudov G.N. Maitland N.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Skibshoj I. Lukanidin E.M. Bronstein I.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); this construct contains four additional amino acids (MGGS) at the N terminus. To uniformly label calgranulin C for NMR spectroscopy, pQE60calC was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) Codon+ (Novagen). For U-15N-labeling, cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal medium (M9) containing 35 mg/liter kanamycin and 1 g/liter [15N]ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source. For U-15N,13C-labeling, cells were grown at 37 °C in M9 medium containing 35 mg/liter kanamycin, 1 g/liter [15N]ammonium chloride, and 0.5 g/liter [13C]glucose instead of unlabeled glucose as the sole carbon source. Cells were grown to ∼0.6 A600, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, grown for 15 h, harvested, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, prior to lysis. The supernatant was diluted 1:1 with low salt buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm CaCl2) and clarified prior to loading onto a phenyl-FF column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 to 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA over 30 min. Fractions containing the eluted protein were pooled and dialyzed into 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0). The dialyzed protein was loaded onto an uno_Q1 column (Bio-Rad) and eluted at 2 ml/min with a linear gradient of 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) to 20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) over 30 min. Fractions containing the eluted protein were pooled, dialyzed into NMR buffer, and concentrated to a final concentration of 0.3-0.5 mm using centricones. All concentrations cited for calgranulin C refer to total monomer concentration. Purity was estimated to be >95% by Coomassie-stained PAGE.Protein Pulldown Assay—10 μ l of 10 μm sRAGE in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl) was mixed with 10 μl of 20 μm HMGB1 in the same buffer. For calgranulin C, 10 μl of 10 μm sRAGE in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm imidazole were mixed with 10 μl of 20 μm Ca2+-calgranulin C in the same buffer. 50 mm imidazole was included in the binding buffer to avoid weak interactions between Ca2+-calgranulin C and Ni2+ beads. After incubating for 10 min, His tag beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the binding buffer were added into the protein solution. The beads were washed three times with the binding buffer. The protein absorbed on the His tag beads was analyzed using Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE.Fluorescence Titrations—Fluorescence titrations were performed using an LS-55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All measurements were made at 25 °C using a 1 × 1-cm quartz cell. The excitation wavelengths were 255 nm for tyrosine fluorescence and 365 or 370 nm for TNS fluorescence; excitation and emission slit widths were 5 and 10 nm, respectively. The fluorescence intensity (F) at a fixed wavelength was corrected for sample dilution upon addition of titrant. Fluorescence data were analyzed using GRAMS (Thermo Galactic) and SPSS (Lead Technologies, Inc.) software.Ca2+ binding to calgranulin C was measured using two fluorescence probes. For tyrosine fluorescence experiments, a 2.5 μm solution of calgranulin C in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) was titrated with a stock solution of CaCl2 (2 mm in distilled water); for TNS fluorescence experiments, a solution containing 2.5 μm calgranulin C and 20 μm TNS in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) was titrated with the stock solution of CaCl2. Corrected fluorescence intensity was fit to Equation 1 to estimate the apparent Ca2+ binding constant, K, for both tyrosine and TNS fluorescence titrations, F=f1N-W-1K+W-N-+1K2+4NK2N+f2N+W+1K-W-N-+1K2+4NK2N(Eq. 1) where f1 is the fluorescence at zero Ca2+ concentration; f2isthe fluorescence of the Ca2+-calgranulin C complex; N is total protein concentration, and W is the total Ca2+ concentration.C1C2 binding to calgranulin C was measured by performing TNS fluorescence titrations. A solution containing 3 μm calgranulin C and 10 μm TNS in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 6.8) plus 400 μm CaCl2 was titrated with a stock solution of C1C2 (44 μm in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 6.8)). Corrected fluorescence intensity was fit to Equation 1 to estimate the apparent C1C2-binding constant K. In this case f1 is the TNS fluorescence at zero C1C2 concentration; f2 is the TNS fluorescence of the [Ca2+-calgranulin C]-C1C2 complex; W is the concentration of C1C2, and N is the concentration of Ca2+-calgranulin C.Gel Filtration—Calgranulin C and sRAGE were equilibrated in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.3), 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2. 50-μl samples of calgranulin C (200 μm) and sRAGE (500 μm) were loaded onto a Superdex™ 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated with the same buffer, and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated using gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad), which contain bovine thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine gamma globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1,350 Da). The axial ratio of Ca2+-calgranulin C was calculated based on the crystallographic coordinates (14Moroz O.V. Antson A.A. Murshudov G.N. Maitland N.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Skibshoj I.

J. 1994; 67: 530-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).Native PAGE—Native gels containing 12, 10.5, and 9% acrylamide were prepared in 0.375 m Tris/HCl (pH 8.8) (29Bollag D. Rozycki M. Edelstein S. Protein Methods. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 155-173Google Scholar). All samples were prepared in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, and 5% glycerol. Concentrations were 200 μm for calgranulin C and 20 μm for sRAGE. Binding reactions containing 20 μm sRAGE and 5, 10, 15, and 20:1 mole ratios of calgranulin C were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 4 °C prior to loading on pre-heated (20 min, 200 V) gels. The gels were loaded under full voltage (200 V) and run at 4 °C for 3 h at 200 V using standard Tris-glycine running buffer (pH 8.3) supplemented with 4 mm CaCl2. Gels were stained using Imperial protein stain (Pierce). The data were processed according to Ref. 29Bollag D. Rozycki M. Edelstein S. Protein Methods. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 155-173Google Scholar. Molecular weight standards used were the same as those used in the column chromatography experiments. All experiments were repeated three times.NMR Experiments—NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance spectrometer, operating at a 1H frequency of 700 MHz and equipped with a cryoprobe. All NMR data were collected at 25 °C. Protein samples of calgranulin C, with concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 mm, were dissolved in NMR buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3). The solution conditions used in these experiments are comparable with those expected to be found in vivo. To prepare Ca2+-calgranulin C, a solution of 1 m CaCl2 was titrated into a 0.5 mm [U-13C,15N]calgranulin C solution until the molar ratio of metal:protein was 6:1. No changes in the NMR spectrum of the protein were detected at higher molar ratios. Gradient diffusion experiments to obtain rotational correlation times were performed using the pulse sequence described previously (30Ferrage F. Zoonens M. Warschawski D.E. Popot J.L. Bodenhausen G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2541-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To perform the titration experiments with sRAGE, a solution of 0.5 mm [U-15N]calgranulin C or [U-15N]Ca2+-calgranulin C was titrated into 0.2 mm sRAGE in three steps to yield sRAGE to calgranulin C molar ratios of 1:1, 1:6, and 1:10, respectively. Titration experiments with C1C2, V domain, and C2 domain of sRAGE were performed by titrating 1mm solutions of C1C2, V domain, and C2 domain into 0.5 mm [U-15N]calgranulin C or [U-15N]Ca2+-calgranulin C solutions. The results of the titration were monitored by 1H{15N} HSQC. Over the course of titration, the signal to noise ratio of the peaks that did not show any changes was kept constant by adjusting the number of scans. The [U-15N]calgranulin C sample did not show any changes in the 1H{15N} HSQC spectra upon 3- and 10-fold dilutions. The 1H{15N} HSQC spectrum of [U-15N]Ca2+-calgranulin C sample showed a slight decrease in line broadening upon 10-fold dilution. The HNCACB, CBCA-(CO)NH, HNCO, HNCACO, and 15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments were collected using previously described sequences. All spectra were processed using TOPSPIN (Bruker, Inc), and assignments were made using CARA (31Masse J.E. Keller R. J. Magn. Reson. 2005; 174: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Titrating C1C2 into apo-calgranulin C and Ca2+-calgranulin C results in free calgranulin C and a large, 200-kDa, complex in an equilibrium characterized by the lifetimes of two states.

In this report, we investigated the effect of proteasome inhibition on oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells, an in vitro model of Parkinson disease. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors provided significant protection against toxicity by 6-hydroxydopamine and H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner. The measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate demonstrated that lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor, significantly reduced 6-hydroxydopamineand H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species production. Proteasome inhibitors elevated the amount of glutathione and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) prior to glutathione elevation. The treatment with lactacystin induced the nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased the level of mRNA for γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, a rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. Furthermore, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, abolished glutathione elevation and cytoprotection by lactacystin. These data suggest that proteasome inhibition afforded cytoprotection against oxidative stress by the elevation of glutathione content, and its elevation was mediated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation.

A. 1996; 93: 1956-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar).Recently, another important hypothesis concerned with the UPS has been developed. The UPS is a major mechanism responsible for the degradation of short-lived, damaged, and misfolded proteins (17.Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the gene encoding parkin (18.Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar), a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) of the UPS (19.Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). In postmortem brains with sporadic PD, a decrease in proteasome activity has been found (20.McNaught K.S. Belizaire R. Isacson O. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 179: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Although it is suggested that impairment of the UPS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD, several groups have reported that proteasome inhibition is also able to provide neuroprotection (21.Phillips J.B. Williams A.J. Adams J. Elliott P.J. Tortella F.C. Stroke. 2000; 31: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 22.van Leyen K. Siddiq A. Ratan R.R. Lo E.H. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proteasome inhibition increases the levels of molecular chaperones including heat shock proteins, and enhances cell resistance to various insults (23.Bush K.T. Goldberg A.L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 24.Ding Q. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is known that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to specific promoter sequences, initiating the transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes, many of which are mediators of inflammatory response (25.Perkins N.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In dopaminergic neurons of patients with PD, nuclear translocation of NF-κB is enhanced (26.Hunot S. Brugg B. Ricard D. Michel P.P. Muriel M.P. Ruberg M. Faucheux B.A. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7531-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), and proteasome inhibition suppresses the activities of NF-κB by stabilizing the inhibitory protein IκB (27.Wojcik C. Di Napoli M. Stroke. 2004; 35: 1506-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrated that proteasome inhibition accelerated the appearance of α-synuclein-positive inclusion bodies and provided neuroprotection (28.Sawada H. Kohno R. Kihara T. Izumi Y. Sakka N. Ibi M. Nakanishi M. Nakamizo T. Yamakawa K. Shibasaki H. Yamamoto N. Akaike A. Inden M. Kitamura Y. Taniguchi T. Shimohama S. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 97: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The relationship, however, between proteasome activity and antioxidant effects has not been clarified. Previous studies indicated that undifferentiated PC12 cells have been shown to synthesize, store, release, and metabolize dopamine as well as differentiated PC12 cells (30.Seegal R.F. Brosch K. Bush B. Ritz M. Shain W. Neurotoxicology. 1989; 10: 757-764PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Kitazawa M. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A.G. Free Radic Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1473-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, undifferentiated PC12 cells in this study have important features that are shared with dopaminergic neurons such as synthesis and storing dopamine and are suitable for a dopaminergic neuronal model. Furthermore, the dopaminergic cells develop features of neurons upon treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF). Differentiated PC12 cells by NGF possess many important neurochemical and signal transduction processes similar to dopaminergic neurons (32.Shafer T.J. Atchison W.D. Neurotoxicology. 1991; 12: 473-492PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we particularly focused on the antioxidant effect of glutathione and investigated the effect of proteasome inhibition on oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in differentiated and non-differentiated PC12 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials−Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) was purchased from Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). 6-Hydroxydopamine hydrochloride and N-acetyl-l-cysteine were purchased from Sigma. 5,5′-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), NADPH, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were obtained from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Glutathione (reduced form) and hydrogen peroxide were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Lactacystin, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG-132), benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(O-t-butyl)-Ala-leucinal (PSI), SB203580, SP600125, PD98059, bisindolylmaleimide I, and wortmannin were from Calbiochem. Glutathione reductase was from Roche Diagnostics. 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). NGF was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI).PC12 Cell Cultures−Rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum. Cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. PC12 cells were seeded in 48-well culture plates for MTT assay, in 35-mm dishes for glutathione analysis and Western blotting, and in 8-well culture slides for ROS evaluation at a density of 8 × 104 cells/cm2. Cells were grown for 24 h and then exposed to drugs. The EC50 was determined by regression analysis according to the following formula. Cell survival (percentage) = 100 × EC50H/(EC50H + [Drug]H) (where [Drug]is the drug concentrations and H is the Hill slope) The analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.03 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).Induction of Differentiation of PC12 Cells−In part of the experiment, PC12 cells were differentiated by NGF. PC12 cells were seeded in poly-l-lysine-coated 48-well culture plates at a density of 4 × 103 cells/cm2. PC12 cells were treated with 50 ng/ml NGF for 7 days and then exposed to drugs.Evaluation of Viability−The cell viability of PC12 cells was determined by MTT assay. The protocol of the MTT assay was described previously (33.Izumi Y. Sawada H. Yamamoto N. Kume T. Katsuki H. Shimohama S. Akaike A. J Neurosci Res. 2005; 82: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the activity of dehydrogenase, which reduces the MTT tetrazolium salt to MTT formazan, was measured by spectrophotometry. The culture medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT tetrazolium salt and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The medium was removed, and the cells were scraped and solubilized into isopropyl alcohol solution. Aliquots were transferred to a 96-well plate, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm. The viability of the cultures was expressed as a percentage of the absorbance measured in control cells.Evaluation of ROS−The average level of intracellular oxygen radicals was measured using DCF-DA dye. The fluorescence of cell-permeable DCF-DA significantly increases after oxidation. PC12 cells were preincubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 30 μm DCF-DA for 20 min and washed with drug-free DMEM. Cells were exposed to 6-OHDA and H2O2 for 30 min, and fluorescence was detected and photographed with an Olympus IX 81 photomicroscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). ROS formation in the cells was evaluated by the fluorescence intensity of 80–120 randomly selected cells.Glutathione Analysis−Glutathione concentration was determined colorimetrically according to how it was oxidized by DTNB (34.Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5502) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline on ice and deproteinated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were mixed with 1 m phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm NADPH. When total glutathione (oxidized and reduced glutathione) concentration was determined, glutathione reductase was added and incubated for 10 min, whereas when only reduced glutathione concentration was determined, glutathione reductase was not added. Subsequently, the reaction was initiated by adding 10 mm DTNB, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Oxidized glutathione concentration was obtained by subtracting the reduced from the total concentration.Western Blot Analysis−PC12 cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline on ice, harvested using a cell scraper, and lysed in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7) containing 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm vanadate, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatants were denatured by boiling. An aliquot of proteins was loaded on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, separated electrophoretically, and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking with non-fatty milk, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody (anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-p38 MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-β-actin (Sigma)) and with a secondary antibody. Immunodetection was performed using a ECL Western blotting detecting system (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK).Preparation of Nuclear Extract and Western Blot for Nrf2− PC12 cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline on ice, harvested using a cell scraper, and lysed in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm vanadate, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. PC12 cells were then incubated on ice for 15 min to allow cells to swell. After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, the resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) containing 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The pellet was then incubated on ice for 30 min and vortexed. The nuclear extract was finally centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was loaded on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot analysis with NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) and lamin B antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed as described above.Reverse Transcription-PCR−Total RNA was extracted from PC12 cells using ISOGEN as recommended by the manufacturer (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). RNA was reversetranscribed in a reaction mixture containing SuperScript II RnaseH-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo dT primers, and then cDNAs were obtained after the reaction ribonuclease H (Invitrogen). The primer sequences were glutamate-l-cysteine ligase catalytic (GLCLC) subunit forward 5′-CCTTCTGGCACAGCACGTTG-3′, GLCLC reverse 5′-TAAGACGGCATCTCGCTCCT-3′, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) forward 5′-AGTGTAGCCCAGGATGCCCTT-3′, and GAPDH reverse 5′-GCCAAGGTCATCCATGACAAC-3′. GAPDH was used as an internal standard. The amplification protocol involved denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min. This cycle was repeated 25 (GLCLC) or 20 (GAPDH) times. PCR products were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with 0.1% ethidium bromide.Proteasome Activity Assay−PC12 cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline on ice and resuspended in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes and 0.5 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed by brief sonication, added to N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) (Affinity Research Product, Exeter, UK), a fluorogenic proteasome substrate, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Levels of released AMC were measured using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm with an automatic multiwell plate reader. The relative activity was standardized by protein concentration, determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit.Statistics−The statistical significance of the difference between three or more groups of individual data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc multiple comparison using Dunnett’s test. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.).RESULTS6-OHDA- and H2O2-induced Cytotoxicity Is Blocked by Proteasome Inhibitors−PC12 cells were exposed to 6-OHDA or H2O2 for 24 h. Exposure to these drugs decreased the viability in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The EC50 was calculated as 105.8 μm (95% confidential intervals, 97.2–114.0 μm) and 194.9 μm (184.0–205.9 μm) for 6-OHDA and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Taking into consideration rapid degradation and attenuation of the cytotoxicity, 150 μm 6-OHDA and 200 μm H2O2 are taken as optimum conditions for further experiments. Lactacystin, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, which was administrated from 24 h before toxic exposure, significantly blocked the cytotoxicity induced by 6-OHDA and H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). As well as lactacystin, other proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 and PSI, also provided cytoprotection against these toxins (Fig. 1, C and D). Six-hour treatment with lactacystin induced a significant decrease in proteasome activity, but 24-h treatment did not (Table 1).TABLE 1Effect of lactacystin on proteasome activityTreatmentProteasome activity (% of control)6 h24 hControl100.0 ± 3.8100.0 ± 5.9Lactacystin (0.1 μm)98.0 ± 6.594.3 ± 3.2Lactacystin (0.3 μm)70.3 ± 5.1**84.9 ± 7.5Lactacystin (1 μm)49.7 ± 2.7**77.2 ± 6.1 Open table in a new tab Proteasome Inhibition Reduces 6-OHDA- and H2O2-induced ROS Production−ROS generation is thought to be involved in cytotoxicity by 6-OHDA because 6-OHDA is easily oxidized by molecular oxygen to produce harmful ROS such as superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical (35.Galindo M.F. Jordan J. Gonzalez-Garcia C. Cena V. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether proteasome inhibitors suppress ROS production, the amount of ROS formation was measured using DCF-DA. For the purpose of detecting ROS generation, the cells needed to be exposed to 6-OHDA or H2O2 within 30 min because background fluorescence by DCF-DA autoxidation gradually elevated. Therefore, the concentrations of 6-OHDA and H2O2 were set at 300 μm for ROS generation study, respectively, higher than those in the experiments for the cell survival study. Lactacystin provided protection against 300 μm 6-OHDA or H2O2 as well as against 150 μm 6-OHDA or 200 μm H2O2 (data not shown). Exposure to 300 μm 6-OHDA and H2O2 elevated the fluorescence intensity of DCF-DA, indicating the elevation of intracellular ROS formation, and pretreatment of lactacystin significantly suppressed the elevation (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Effect of lactacystin on 6-OHDA- and H2O2-mediated ROS production. A–D, representative fluorescence microscope images of PC12 cells. The level of intracellular reactive oxygen radicals was measured with DCF-DA.

Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5925) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, glutathione content was significantly elevated by treatment with NAC for 24 h, pretreatment that provided significant protection against cytotoxicity caused by 6-OHDA and H2O2 exposure (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Effect of NAC on 6-OHDA- and H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. A, the amount of total glutathione (GSH and GSSG) of PC12 cells following 24-h treatment with NAC.

Exposure to 1 μm lactacystin significantly increased the amount of reduced GSH, and GSH elevation peaked at about 24 h after exposure. The amount of GSSG was not increased within 12 h and was elevated only after 24 h (Fig. 4A). In addition, treatment with lactacystin for 24 h elevated the glutathione content in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Other proteasome inhibitors, such as MG-132 and PSI, also increased the glutathione content (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4Effects of proteasome inhibitors on the amount of glutathione. A, the amount of GSH and GSSG of PC12 cells following treatment with 1 μm lactacystin for 2–48 h. When only GSH concentration was determined, glutathione reductase was not added to the assay.

To determine whether de novo protein synthesis is required for the elevation of glutathione content, cycloheximide, an inhibitor of cytoplasmic translation, was co-administrated with lactacystin. Cycloheximide significantly suppressed the elevation of glutathione content induced by lactacystin (Table 2).TABLE 2Effects of several inhibitors on the elevation of glutathione contentTreatmentTotal glutathionenmol/mg of proteinControl70.6 ± 32.4Lactacystin (1 μM)320.5 ± 76.9##+ Cycloheximide (10 nm)216.8 ± 12.2*+ Cycloheximide (30 nm)150.0 ± 11.5**+ Cycloheximide (100 nm)98.3 ± 11.9**+ SB203580 (3 μm)220.0 ± 37.7*+ SB203580 (10 μm)190.5 ± 37.9**+ SB203580 (30 μm)133.5 ± 17.7**+ BIM (3 μm)354.0 ± 52.5+ Wortmannin (10 μm)248.7 ± 64.9+ PD98059 (30 μm)234.0 ± 49.0+ SP600125 (10 μm)341.4 ± 55.4 Open table in a new tab To reveal the phosphorylation pathways involved in glutathione synthesis, several phosphorylation inhibitors were tested. The elevation of glutathione content by lactacystin was diminished by neither bisindolylmaleimide I, a protein kinase C inhibitor, wortmannin, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, PD98059, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor, nor SP600125, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor. However, co-administration of SB203580, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, inhibited the elevation of glutathione content (Table 2).Cytoprotection by Proteasome Inhibition Is Mediated by the Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK−To confirm the relationship between p38 MAPK phosphorylation and glutathione elevation, the activation of p38 MAPK was determined by Western blots using a specific phosphorylated p38 MAPK antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2032948190,"Transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the MAPKKK family, was initially described to play an essential role in the transforming growth factor β-signaling pathway, but recent evidence has emerged implicating TAK1 in the interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways. Notably, two homologous proteins, TAB2 and TAB3, have been identified as adaptors linking TAK1 to the upstream adaptors TRAFs. However, it remains unclear whether the interaction between TAB2/TAB3 and TAK1 is necessary for its kinase activation and subsequent activation of the IKK and MAPK pathways. Here, we characterized the TAB2/TAB3-binding domain in TAK1 and further examined the requirement of this interaction for IL-1, TNF, and RANKL signaling. Through deletion mapping experiments, we demonstrated that the binding motif for TAB2/TAB3 is a non-contiguous region located within the last C-terminal 100 residues of TAK1. However, residues 479–553 of TAK1 appear to be necessary and sufficient for TAB2/TAB3 interaction. Conversely, residues 574–693 of TAB2 were shown to interact with TAK1. A green fluorescent protein fusion protein containing the last 100 residues of TAK1 (TAK1-C100) abolished the interaction of endogenous TAB2/TAB3 with TAK1, the phosphorylation of TAK1, and prevented the activation of IKK and MAPK induced by IL-1, TNF, and RANKL. Furthermore, TAK1-C100 blocked RANKL-induced nuclear accumulation of NFATc1 and consequently osteoclast differentiation consistent with the ability of a catalytically inactive TAK1 to block RANKL-mediated signaling. Significantly, our study provides evidence that the TAB2/TAB3 interaction with TAK1 is crucial for the activation of signaling cascades mediated by IL-1, TNF, and RANKL.

Following receptor activation, these cytokines induce a cascade of signaling events leading to the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP1 through upstream kinases including IκB kinase (IKK) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs; JNK, p38, and ERK). These events culminate in the expression and regulation of numerous pro-inflammatory genes (1Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baud V. Karin M.

Members of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of adaptor proteins are involved in coupling activated TNF and IL-1 receptors to NF-κB and MAPKs pathways (8Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M.

Although TRAF proteins have no known enzymatic activity, recent evidence indicates that they act as E3s through their N-terminal really interesting new gene (RING) domain (12Lamothe B. Besse A. Campos A.D. Webster W.K. Wu H. Darnay B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar, 13Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 14Chen Z.J. Bhoj V. Seth R.B. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). RING-type E3s contain a series of Cys and His residues distinctly separated to constitute a novel zinc-binding domain. TRAF6 together with the heterodimeric E2 complex (Ubc13/Uev1A) facilitates the synthesis of unique Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains on itself, rather than the conventional Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains that target proteins for degradation. This unique Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain likely provides a scaffold to recruit downstream effector molecules to activate various signaling components. TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2), or its homologue TAB3, appears to be the adaptor molecule linking these TRAF molecules to activate TAK1 (15Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H.

Both TAB2 and TAB3 contain a highly conserved C-terminal novel zinc finger domain, which binds preferentially to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains (20Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). 3B. G. Darnay, unpublished observations. Mutation of this zinc finger domain abolishes the ability of TAB2 and TAB3 to bind to polyubiquitin chains, as well as their ability to activate TAK1 that appears to be a ubiquitin-dependent kinase of MKK and IKK (21Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the polyubiquitination events induce TAK1 activation has yet to be determined. Following IL-1, TNF, or LPS stimulation, two possible TAK1 complexes exist, one which consists of TAB2-TAK1-TAB1 and another that consists of TAB3-TAK1-TAB1, which causes the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB pathways (18Cheung P.C. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). These data suggest that TAB2 and TAB3 may play redundant roles in TAK1 activation (18Cheung P.C. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, activation of NF-κB and MAPKs pathways by IL-1 and TNF is intact in TAB2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (22Sanjo H. Takeda K. Tsujimura T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 4A. Besse, unpublished observations. Additionally, knockdown of both TAB2/TAB3 by small interfering RNA results in complete loss of TAK1 activation (19Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Whereas it appears that TAK1 activation requires polyubiquitination of TRAF6 and RIP1 in the IL-1 and TNF pathways, respectively, the precise role of TAB2/TAB3 in TAK1 activation has not been clearly investigated. Furthermore, the dissection of the respective roles of TAB2 and TAB3 in regulating TAK1 signaling is prevented due to the compensatory nature of these proteins. The development of a construct that could ablate the functional interaction of both TAB2/TAB3 with TAK1 could be an alternative strategy to examine the functional role of TAB2/TAB3 in regulating TAK1-dependent signaling. In this study, we demonstrated that the binding motif for TAB2/TAB3 on TAK1 is a non-contiguous region within the last C-terminal 100 residues of TAK1 (TAK1-C100), and more specifically encompassing residues 479–553 of TAK1. Furthermore, TAK1-C100 prevented endogenous interaction of TAB2 and TAK1, and blocked IL-1 and TNF signaling. Additionally, we show the requirement of TAK1 kinase activity in RANKL signaling and osteoclast differentiation. Notably, we demonstrate that TAK1-C100 abolishes RANKL-mediated activation of IKK and JNK, nuclear accumulation of NFATc1, and terminal osteoclast differentiation. Our results reveal the critical function of the TAB2/TAB3 and TAK1 interaction for eliciting TAK1-dependent signals generated by the cytokines IL-1, TNF, and RANKL.

Plasmids—Mouse TAK1-K63W cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Tan (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The cDNA encoding full-length TAK1-K63W was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers containing EcoRI (5′) and BamHI (3′) sites that was subsequently digested and cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma). To obtain wild-type TAK1 (TAK1-WT), the K63W mutation was reversed using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry and Data Analysis—Prior to analysis, purified GST fusion proteins consisting of TAK1-(479–579) and TAB2-(574–693) in which the GST portion was cleaved with thrombin were further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200). Following overnight dialysis with identical buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride), the protein was concentrated in Amicon Ultra-4 tubes (Millipore) with a 5-kDa molecular mass cutoff. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements were performed at 25 °C using a VP-ITC machine that was connected to a computer with ORIGIN software (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). Prior to titration, protein samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and degassed by vacuum aspiration for ∼10 min. The calorimeter cell and titration syringe were extensively rinsed with dialysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethel)phosphine hydrochloride). The calorimetric titrations were carried out with 20–45 injections of 5–10 μl of TAK1 residues 479–579 (0.5–0.8 μm), spaced 180 s apart, into the sample cell containing a solution of 1.334 ml of TAB2 residues 574–693 (20–80 μm). After subtracting the heat of dilution, the association constant (KA), enthalpy change (ΔH), and the stoichiometry (N) were obtained by fitting the thermograms to a one-set binding site model using ORIGIN software. The remaining thermodynamic parameters, the dissociation constant (KD), free energy change (ΔG), and the entropy change (ΔS) were calculated from the relationships: KA-1 = KD and –RT lnKA =ΔG =ΔH - TΔS. Transfection and Retroviral Infection—Transfection of HEK293 cells was performed using the Calcium Phosphate Transfection kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For production of retroviral supernatants, GP2-293 cells were co-transfected with the indicated retroviral vector and pVSV-G (Clontech) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twelve hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Viral supernatants were collected after 48–72 h and used to infect HEK293, RAW264.7, or L929 cells. After 2 days, selection was initiated with G418 (500 μg/ml) or puromycin (4 μg/ml). Stable pools of cells or clones were maintained in G418 (300 μg/ml) or puromycin (2 μg/ml). Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293 cells were plated into 6-well plates and transfected as above together with an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter construct (0.5 μg/well). The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 2.5 μg/well with empty vector. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System from Promega (Madison, WI). Protein Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Cells were harvested, washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin for 20 min on ice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Protein was estimated by using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye. For immunoprecipitation, equivalent amounts of cell lysate were incubated with various antibodies for 2 h at 4°C under rotation. Then 15 μl of Protein A/G-agarose beads were added and incubated for an additional hour at 4 °C under rotation. The immune complex was washed 3 times with lysis buffer and one time with low-salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). For GST pull-down assays, glutathione-agarose beads coated with the indicated GST fusion proteins were mixed with equivalent amounts of cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C under rotation. The protein complexes were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and one time with low-salt buffer. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates, GST pulled-down protein complexes, or cell lysates were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibody and then visualized by using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Kinase Assays—JNK and NEMO activities were analyzed using GST-Jun and GST-IκBα as substrates as previously described (23Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 24Polek T.C. Talpaz M. Darnay B.G. Spivak-Kroizman T. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were plated in 6-well or 10-cm plates and the next day they were starved overnight. The following day, cells were treated with the indicated cytokine and washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in lysis buffer and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Equivalent amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK1 or anti-NEMO antibodies as described above. The kinase assay was performed in a 2 times reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 μg of GST-Jun or GST-IκBα, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of GST-Jun or GST-IκBα was detected using autoradiography. The incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into the substrate was quantitated with a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Osteoclast Differentiation—Stable RAW cell lines were plated in 24-well plates at 1 × 104 cells/well in triplicate, and the next day treated with 100 ng/ml with RANKL. After 5 days, cells were fixed and stained for TRAP after which pictures were taken of representative fields. Osteoclast formation was assessed by counting the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells per well. In some cases prior to fixing the cells, pictures were taken with a ×10 objective lens under bright or fluorescent light. Binding of TAB2 Occurs in a Non-contiguous Region within the C-terminal Tail of TAK1—Whereas previous studies have shown that TAB2 could interact with the C terminus of TAK1, the precise domain in TAK1 that is required for TAB2 binding has not been mapped. To further map the region of TAK1 that is required to bind TAB2, we took two alternative approaches. In the first approach, we created a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of FLAG-tagged TAK1 (Fig. 1A) and co-transfected full-length TAK1 (TAK1-FL) or the indicated TAK1 deletion mutants with FLAG-TAB2 in HEK293 cells. The cell lysates were either immunoprecipitated with anti-TAB2 and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG or immunoblotted with anti-FLAG. TAB2 co-precipitated with only TAK1-FL, TAK1-Δ5, and TAK1-Δ6 (Fig. 1B). Analysis of these TAK1 deletion mutants indicated that TAB2 appears to interact with residues 479–547 of TAK1, because TAK1-Δ5 and TAK1-Δ6 both interacted with TAB2, but not TAK1-Δ1–Δ4 or TAK1-Δ7. In confirmation of these results, we performed GST fusion pull-down experiments with either GST or GST-TAB2 and lysates from transiently transfected HEK293 cells programmed to express various TAK1 deletion mutants. Similar to the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, only TAK1-FL, TAK1-Δ5, and TAK1-Δ6 interacted with GST-TAB2 (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that the region of TAK1 comprised between the residues 479 and 547 interacts with TAB2. In the alternative approach, we compared the primary amino acid sequence within the last 100 residues of TAK1 from multiple species and designed three internal TAK1 deletion mutants that lacked residues between 508 and 547 (Fig. 1A, Δ8–Δ10). We analyzed the ability of these TAK1 mutants to interact with co-transfected TAB2 in HEK293 cells. TAB2 co-precipitated with TAK1-FL and TAK1-Δ8, but weakly with TAK1-Δ9 and not at all with TAK1-Δ10 (Fig. 1D). Similarly, GST-TAB2 also interacted with TAK1-FL and TAK1-Δ8, but weakly with TAK1-Δ9 and not at all with TAK1-Δ10 (Fig. 1E), suggesting that residues 521–545 are not essential for the interaction but residues 509–520 are important. TAB3, a Homologue of TAB2, Binds to the Same Region of TAK1—TAB3 has recently been described as a functional homologue of TAB2 (17Jin G. Klika A. Callahan M. Faga B. Danzig J. Jiang Z. Li X. Stark G.R. Harrington J. Sherf B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Cheung P.C. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To determine whether the TAB2-binding region in TAK1 interacts also with TAB3, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with various TAK1 deletion mutants and examined their ability to precipitate with GST-TAB3. Similar to TAB2, GST-TAB3 interacted only with TAK1-FL, TAK1-Δ6, and TAK1-Δ8 (Fig. 1F). Notably, TAK1-Δ9 interacted weakly with GST-TAB2, but not at all with GST-TAB3 suggesting a slight variation in the binding motif. A GFP Fusion Protein Containing the C-terminal 100 Residues of TAK1 Binds Both TAB2 and TAB3—The data presented thus far indicate that residues 509–520 of TAK1 are important for binding both TAB2 and TAB3. To determine whether this region is sufficient to interact with TAB2/TAB3, we created GFP fusion proteins containing residues 505–536 or 505–547 of TAK1 and examined their ability to bind TAB2; however, both of these constructs failed to interact with TAB2 and TAB3 (data not shown). Because both TAB2 and TAB3 interacted with TAK1-Δ6, which contains the C-terminal 100 residues of TAK1, we generated additional GFP fusion proteins consisting of residues 479–579 (TAK1-C100), 479–520 (TAK1-(479–520)), 505–553 (TAK1-(505–553)), and 479–553 (TAK1-(479–553)) of TAK1 (Fig. 2A). The GFP fusion protein containing TAK1-C100 and TAK1-(479–553) interacted with both TAB2 and TAB3 by co-immunoprecipitation and GST fusion pull-down experiments, whereas GFP fusion proteins containing TAK1-(479–520) or TAK1-(505–553) failed to interact with TAB2 and TAB3 (Fig. 2, B and C). Collectively, these data indicate that the interaction of TAB2/TAB3 with TAK1 resides in a non-contiguous region of TAK1, and suggests that residues 509–520 of TAK1 are important for this interaction, but not sufficient for binding TAB2 and TAB3 (see “Discussion”). The C-terminal 100 Residues of TAK1 Bind to Residues 574–693 of TAB2—Because we mapped a small region of TAK1 that is necessary for interaction with TAB2/TAB3, we also determined the region of TAB2 that interacts with TAK1. We constructed a series of GST fusion proteins containing the C-terminal region of TAB2 (Fig. 2D) and similar to previous experiments, we examined their ability to interact with TAK1. HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged TAK1 and cell lysates were used in GST pull-down experiments. TAK1 interacted with TAB2 mutants containing residues 516–693 or 574–693, but not with residues containing primarily the C-terminal zinc finger domain of TAB2-(653–693) (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that a region between residues 574 and 653 of TAB2 is necessary to interact with TAK1. Consistent with these observations, mutation of the zinc finger domain (C670A/C673A) of TAB2 did not prevent TAK1 from interacting with TAB2 (data not shown). In confirmation of our findings, we examined quantitatively the interaction between recombinant proteins consisting of the C termini of both TAK1-(479–579) and TAB2-(574–693) by isothermal titr"
https://openalex.org/W1984614018,"Tuberculosis is still a major health problem, and understanding the mechanism by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) invades and colonizes its host target cells remains an important issue for the control of infection. The innate immune system C-type lectins (C-TLs), including the human pulmonary surfactant protein A (PSP-A), have been recently identified as determinant players in the early recognition of the invading pathogen and in mounting the host defense response. Although the antigenic lipoglycan mannosylated lipoarabinomannan is currently considered to be the major C-TL target on the mycobacterial surface, the recognition by some C-TLs of the only mycobacterial species composing the “Mtb complex” indicates that mannosylated lipoarabinomannan cannot account alone for this specificity. Thus, we searched for the mycobacterial molecules targeted by human PSP-A, focusing our attention on the Mtb surface glycoproteins. We developed an original functional proteomic approach based on a lectin blot assay using crude human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a source of physiological PSP-A. Combined with selective cell-surface protein extraction and mass spectrometry peptide mapping, this strategy allowed us to identify the Apa (alanine- and proline-rich antigenic) glycoprotein as new potential target for PSP-A. This result was supported by direct binding of PSP-A to purified Apa. Moreover, EDTA addition or deglycosylation of purified Apa samples completely abolished the interaction, demonstrating that the interaction is calcium- and mannose-dependent, as expected. Finally, we provide convincing evidence that Apa, formerly considered as mainly secreted, is associated with the cell wall for a sufficiently long time to aid in the attachment of PSP-A. Because, to date, Apa seems to be restricted to the Mtb complex strains, we propose that it may account for the selective recognition of those strains by PSP-A and other immune system C-TLs containing homologous functional domains.

We developed an original functional proteomic approach based on a lectin blot assay using crude human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a source of physiological PSP-A. Combined with selective cell-surface protein extraction and mass spectrometry peptide mapping, this strategy allowed us to identify the Apa (alanine- and proline-rich antigenic) glycoprotein as new potential target for PSP-A. This result was supported by direct binding of PSP-A to purified Apa. Moreover, EDTA addition or deglycosylation of purified Apa samples completely abolished the interaction, demonstrating that the interaction is calcium- and mannose-dependent, as expected. Finally, we provide convincing evidence that Apa, formerly considered as mainly secreted, is associated with the cell wall for a sufficiently long time to aid in the attachment of PSP-A. Because, to date, Apa seems to be restricted to the Mtb complex strains, we propose that it may account for the selective recognition of those strains by PSP-A and other immune system C-TLs containing homologous functional domains. With 2 millions deaths each year (2% increased incidence) and the sporadic resurgence of highly virulent strains, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), 3The abbreviations used are: Mtb, M. tuberculosis; C-TLs, C-type lectins; PSP, pulmonary surfactant protein; CRDs, carbohydrate recognition domains; ManLAMs, mannosylated lipoarabinomannans; BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; CSP, cell-surface protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; h, human; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. 3The abbreviations used are: Mtb, M. tuberculosis; C-TLs, C-type lectins; PSP, pulmonary surfactant protein; CRDs, carbohydrate recognition domains; ManLAMs, mannosylated lipoarabinomannans; BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; CSP, cell-surface protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; h, human; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. the etiologic agent of human pulmonary tuberculosis, is considered to be a major public health threat, requiring a global mobilization of the international community (1Ibanga H.B.

Dis. 2006; 6: 522-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, the alarming emergence of multidrug-resistant forms of the bacillus in developed countries has unveiled the weakness of the existing therapeutic arsenal available to fight this important disease. One reason for this paradox is that, despite decades of effort, the molecular basis of the pathogenicity of Mtb is still poorly understood. Central to the Mtb infection lies the ability of the pathogenic bacillus to hide from the infected host defense mechanisms when entering and colonizing the host’s immune cells, principally alveolar macrophages, which paradoxically should be in charge of its clearance (2Gatfield J. Pieters J. Adv. Immunol. 2003; 81: 45-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Hence, the initial step of the interaction between the infectious bacillus and its target cell is likely to be decisive for the outcome of the infection because it must determine the mechanism by which facultative intracellular Mtb will escape from the primary immune response (3Nguyen L. Pieters J. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 269-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Many intracellular pathogens have been found to produce species-specific adhesion molecules to recognize and bind specifically definite receptors of their target cells. On the contrary, current data strongly suggest that mycobacteria have developed a divergent strategy to cheat the immune system by taking advantage of different “pathogen recognition receptors” of the host immune system, hijacking them from their original defense role. In this context, the mannose-specific “C-type” lectins (C-TLs) of the host primary defense line have been the focus of considerable attention, as they have emerged as preferential Trojan horses used by mycobacteria to enter their target cells (4Gilleron M. Rivière M. Puzo G. Glycans in Cell Interaction and Recognition: Therapeutic Aspects. 2001; (Aubery, M., ed) pp. , Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam: 113-140Google Scholar). Indeed, either the soluble pulmonary surfactant protein (PSP) A (5Pasula R. Downing J.F. Wright J.R. Kachel D.L. Davis Jr., T.E. Martin II, W.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 5513-5516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) have been shown to bind mycobacteria and facilitate their entry into phagocytes. Although extremely divergent in their structure, location, and organization, these C-TLs contain from 1 to 18 highly homologous carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), which recognize and bind mannose-containing glycoconjugates exposed on the surface of numerous infectious pathogens, including mycobacteria (9Zelensky A.N. Gready J.E. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6179-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The discovery of the mycobacterial glycoconjugates recognized by these immune system mannose-specific lectins therefore constitutes a major challenge to gain insight into the host-pathogen molecular interaction.

J. 2002; 365: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have identified the mannosylated lipoarabinomannans (ManLAMs), key antigenic lipoglycans of the pathogenic mycobacterial envelope, as the most likely target ligand of this class of pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors, which appear to play a fundamental role in the protection of the host against microbial infection.Indeed, ManLAM has been proposed as being responsible for the specific macrophage mannose receptor-mediated phagocytosis of pathogenic Mtb (10Schlesinger L.S. Kaufman T.M. Iyer S. Hull S.R. Marchiando L.K. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4568-4575PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, Ferguson et al. (6Ferguson J.S. Voelker D.R. McCormack F.X. Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 312-321PubMed Google Scholar) identified ManLAM as a potential ligand of human PSP-D, whereas we found that purified human PSP-A exclusively binds to ManLAM and the structurally related lipomannan (11Sidobre S. Nigou J. Puzo G. Rivière M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2415-2422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Sidobre S. Puzo G. Rivière M. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Finally, recent observations reported by some of us strongly support that ManLAM is also a ligand of DC-SIGN, the major C-TL class receptor for Mtb found on the dendritic cell surface (8Maeda N. Nigou J. Herrmann J.L. Jackson M. Amara A. Lagrange P.H. Puzo G. Gicquel B. Neyrolles O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5513-5516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).However, a fair amount of evidence suggests indubitably that these immune system C-TLs may recognize other still undefined glycosylated molecules on the surface of invading mycobacteria. Recently, Pitarque et al. (13Pitarque S. Herrmann J.L. Duteyrat J.L. Jackson M. Stewart G.R. Lecointe F. Payre B. Schwartz O. Young D.B. Marchal G. Lagrange P.H. Puzo G. Gicquel B. Nigou J. Neyrolles O. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) demonstrated that all pathogenic mycobacterial strains producing ManLAM do not thoroughly bind to DC-SIGN and that the recognition of mycobacteria by DC-SIGN-transfected HeLa cells seems to be restricted to the Mtb complex species (i.e. Mtb, BCG, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum). Moreover, they found that the glycosylated 45-kDa (Apa: alanine- and proline-rich antigenic) and 19-kDa proteins, two major mycobacterial secreted antigens, are able to inhibit the binding of Mtb to DC-SIGN-transfected HeLa cells. Although these data do not definitively demonstrate that the proteins bind directly to DC-SIGN, they strongly support the idea that additional Mtb surface molecules different from ManLAM or lipomannan, possibly glycoproteins, may be specifically recognized by DC-SIGN and probably also by the other mannose-specific C-TLs. Furthermore, these recent observations notably corroborate the prior proposal that human PSP-A binds to Mtb via the recognition of a putative highly mannosylated 60-kDa glycoprotein (5Pasula R. Downing J.F. Wright J.R. Kachel D.L. Davis Jr., T.E. Martin II, W.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Thus, in view of the great interest that such adhesins specific to the Mtb complex mycobacteria may have as potential targets for the development of new pharmacological competitors/inhibitors of the C-TL-mediated Mtb invasion (14Sharon N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), we reconsidered the presence in M. bovis BCG of still uncharacterized mycobacterial surface glycoproteins recognized by PSP-A. With this aim, we developed an original functional proteomic strategy based on the use of crude human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from alveolar proteinosis patients (as a source of physiological native PSP-A) to detect and identify the putative mycobacterial surface ligand for PSP-A. Using this innovative lectin blot analysis approach combined with a specific extraction procedure for surface proteins, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry peptide fingerprinting, we definitively confirmed the presence of such protein ligands that have been identified as the Apa protein complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—BALFs from patients with alveolar proteinosis were a generous gift from Dr. M. C. Pré;vost (INSERM U326, Purpan Teaching Hospital, Toulouse, France). ManLAMs and lipomannan from M. bovis BCG 1173P2 and M. tuberculosis H37Rv were purified in our laboratory by J. Nigou (15Gilleron M. Nigou J. Cahuzac B. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2147-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Nigou J. Gilleron M. Cahuzac B. Bounery J.D. Herold M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23094-23103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). 45–47-kDa purified protein and mouse monoclonal antibodies (clone AsA3) against M. tuberculosis 45–47-kDa protein were kindly provided by Drs. G. Marchal and F. Romain (Pasteur Institute, Paris, France). All chemicals were from Sigma unless stated otherwise.Mycobacterial Cultures—M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. bovis BCG 1173 (Pasteur vaccine strain), Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, and M. smegmatis mc2155:ApaMtb were grown as a surface pellicle at 37 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 medium supplemented with 5% albumin/dextrose/catalase (Difco). After 7 days (for the M. smegmatis strains) or 3 weeks (for Mtb and BCG) of culture, cells were harvested, and the surface components were extracted as described below. M. smegmatis expressing the 45-kDa glycoprotein was obtained by transforming M. smegmatis mc2155 with pSMT3-19.Preparation of Mycobacterial Surface Material Extract—Harvested cells were submitted to gentle agitation for 1 min with 4-mm diameter glass beads (VWR International) and suspended in distilled water. Bacillus suspension was immediately filtered under vacuum through a 0.2-μm pore size 150-ml sterile filter unit (NALGENE Labware). The amount of protein in the cell-surface protein (CSP) extract was estimated using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and aliquots corresponding to 60 μg of proteins were stored at –20 °C.Trichloroacetic Acid Precipitation—Trichloroacetic acid (20% (w/v) final concentration) was added to 60 μg of equivalent protein from CSP extract, and the proteins were allowed to precipitate on ice for 30 min. Precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and residual trichloroacetic acid was removed by two washes and centrifugations with cooled acetone.Monosaccharide Analysis by Capillary Zone Electrophoresis/Laser-induced Fluorescence Detection—CSP extract samples corresponding to 0.25 μg of equivalent protein were hydrolyzed under acidic conditions (2 n trifluoroacetic acid, 120 min, 110 °C). The resulting monosaccharides were derivatized with 1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate and analyzed by capillary zone electrophoresis/laser-induced fluorescence detection as described previously (17Monsarrat B. Brando T. Condouret P. Nigou J. Puzo G. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Gel Electrophoresis—One-dimensional electrophoresis was performed using protein (10 μg/lane) from M. bovis BCG CSP extract on 15% hand-cast analytical SDS-polyacrylamide gels (0.75 mm thick, 8.3 × 7.3 cm) with a Mini-PROTEAN 3 electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). Samples were run at a constant 20 mA for 1 h (PowerPac 300, Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. The masses of the molecular standards (catalog no. 10748-010, Invitrogen) are those reported by the manufacturer. CSP extract/SDS-polyacrylamide gels were developed with the PlusOne™ protein silver staining kit from Amersham Biosciences. For two-dimensional electrophoresis, 60 μg of precipitated proteins were solubilized in 125 μl of rehydration buffer (7 m urea (99.5% purity; Prolabo Chemicals & Reagents, Fontenay Sous Bois, France), 2 m thiourea (>99% purity; Fluka), 4% CHAPS (+98% purity), 30 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% carrier ampholytes buffer (pH 3–10; Bio-Rad), and trace bromphenol blue). The sample was incubated with constant shaking for 4 h at room temperature before loading onto a 7-cm immobilized pH gradient strip (broad pH 3–10 range or narrow pH 3–6 range; Bio-Rad). Isoelectric focusing was performed with the IPGphor isoelectric focusing system (Amersham Biosciences). The following voltage profile was used: a constant 50 V, 12 h (active rehydration step); a constant 200 V, 30 min; a constant 500 V, 30 min; a constant 1000 V, 30 min; and linear increase to 8000 V to reach a total current value of 8000 V-h. The strips were then successively equilibrated for 15 min in 30 mm dithiothreitol, followed by 15 min in 135 mm iodoacetamide in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and trace bromphenol blue). After equilibration, the strips were applied to a 15% hand-cast preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel (1.5 mm thick, 8.3 × 7.3 cm) and sealed with hot low-melting-point agarose (Amresco, Inc.).Western Blotting—All steps were performed at room temperature (20–25 °C). Mycobacterial CSP extracts resolved by one- or two-dimensional SDS-PAGE were transferred with the Trans-Blot semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Biosciences) using Tris/glycine/methanol buffer (48 mm Tris base, 39 mm glycine, 0.1% (v/v) SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol (pH 9.2)). Membranes were then blocked for 2 h with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl (pH 8)) with 0.2% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and finally washed three times with TBS-T. Specific immunological identification of the Apa proteins was obtained by a 2-h incubation of the blocked membranes with rabbit anti-M. tuberculosis 45–47-kDa polyclonal antibodies diluted 1:5000 in TBS-T, followed by exposure to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Sigma). Membranes exposed to horseradish peroxidase conjugates were washed and overlaid with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Lumi-Light ECL substrate, Roche Diagnostics) and then exposed to Lumi-Film chemiluminescent detection film (Roche Diagnostics) for 10 s to 5 min before development. Control membranes were stained with secondary antibodies only. Supplemental Western blot analyses were performed after membrane stripping by a 30-min incubation in 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 2.5).Lectin Blotting—Lectin blotting was performed according to a procedure very similar to the immunoblot procedure described above, except that, after blocking, the membranes were incubated with human BALF diluted 1:10 in TBS-T plus 5 mm CaCl2 for 12 h at 4 °C. After careful washing with the same buffer, binding of human (h) PSP-A was revealed using rabbit anti-hPSP-A polyclonal antibodies (Ab3420, Chemicon; working dilution of 1:2500) using the same procedure as described above, except that 5 mm CaCl2 was added to all buffers.Glycoprotein Detection—Glycoproteins of the M. bovis BCG CSP extract were specifically identified after transfer to nitrocellulose membrane using the digoxigenin glycan detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s recommended procedure.In-gel Protein Digestion—Protein spots excised from Coomassie Blue-stained two-dimensional gels were cut into smaller gel pieces and submitted to the standard protocol available on the University of California, San Francisco, web site (donatello.ucsf.edu/ingel.html).Mass Spectrometry and Protein Data Bank Mining—The samples were analyzed using a 4700 proteomics analyzer MALDI-TOF/TOF system (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a / laser operating at 200 Hz. All mass spectra were recorded in reflector mode using positive ion detection and were obtained by accumulating 2500 subspectra generated by 250 laser pulses on 10 distinct areas of the dried droplet. Mass spectra were recorded for all sample spots on the plate and calibrated using the instrument external calibration procedure. Each sample mass spectrum was further internally calibrated with Data Explorer Version 4.4 software (Applied Biosystems) using signals from autoproteolytic fragments of trypsin (peptides 58–77 and 98–107) present in the spectrum. Data Explorer peak detection parameters were adapted on each mass spectrum to generate monoisotopic peptide mass lists corresponding to the mass values of the 30 highest intensity ion peaks found between 1000 and 3500 Da. These lists were then used to mine the two major public protein data banks NCBInr and Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL using the ProteinProspector MS-Fit search engine of the University of California, San Francisco. Standard search parameters were set as follows: trypsin digest with one missed cleavage; fixed carbamidomethylation of cysteines and alternative oxidation of methionines; species, all/microorganisms; and peptide mass tolerance, 50 ppm.Solid-phase Cell Binding Assays—Solid-phase binding assays were carried out on microtiter plates (Nunc-Immuno, Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). Coating of mycobacterial cells was achieved by incubating cells (5 or 2.5 μg/100 μl) in suspension in coating buffer for 1 h at 37°C. The remaining steps of the protocol were performed at room temperature unless stated otherwise. Wells were blocked for 2 h in blocking buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, and 30% low fat dry milk (pH 7.4)). The wells were extensively rinsed with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.4% low fat dry milk (pH 7.4)). 100 μl of diluted (1:10 in wash buffer) alveolar proteinosis patient BALF containing hPSP-A were added and allowed to react overnight with coated mycobacterial cells. After extensive washing, 100 μl of rabbit anti-hPSP-A polyclonal antibodies (working dilution of 1:4000 in wash buffer) were loaded onto the wells and incubated for 3 h. After extensive washing, 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit monoclonal immunoglobulins (clone RG16; 1:2000 dilution in wash buffer) were added and allowed to react for 1 h. Microtiter wells were then extensively washed with substrate buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, and 0.1 mm MgCl2 (pH 9.5)), and alkaline phosphatase activity was detected by incubation of 100 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml in substrate buffer) at 37 °C. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured on a microtiter plate reader (μQuant, BioTek Instruments, Inc). Each value reported is the mean of triplicate measures ± S.D. from four independent experiments.RESULTSMycobacterial Cell Wall Protein Extraction—hPSP-A is a highly multimeric protein produced by type II alveolar cells as lipoprotein complexes. The quantitatively major physiological form of hPSP-A is composed of six heterotrimers (18 subunits) of the SPA1 and SPA2 gene products. Hence, with regard to the substantial size (>100 kDa) of the octadecameric native protein, which may limit its free diffusion within the bacterial envelope, we hypothesized that, to be recognized, the ligands must be easily accessible to such high molecular mass receptors and thus localized in the outermost layer of the envelope. Thus, we chose to limit our investigation and to probe PSP-A binding only to the surface components of the mycobacterial cell wall. With this aim, we tentatively applied an approved specific mechanical treatment with glass beads to strip off and extract selectively the outermost components (18Daffe M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, freshly filtered M. bovis BCG cells were gently shaken with glass beads to limit bacterial cell disruption and subsequent excessive contamination by intracellular compounds. The intact cell bodies were removed by centrifugation to obtain the crude cell wall extract (supernatant). According to the current structural and architectural model of the mycobacterial envelope, this extract was found to contain large amounts of the outermost exposed soluble neutral polysaccharides, viz. glucan and the arabinomannan (almost 40%; see “Experimental Procedures” for details) (18Daffe M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins released from the surface were then further concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation to remove selectively the unwanted trichloroacetic acid-soluble saccharide material. As expected, the resulting pellet was found to contain up to 85% of the protein (in mass). When analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis and silver nitrate staining, this so-called CSP extract showed no discernible qualitative protein composition with the crude cell-surface extract. As a corollary to this, the quasi-absence of protein bands detectable in the non-precipitated trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction supports the idea that the surface proteins were wholly recovered in the pellet. Carbohydrate analysis by capillary zone electrophoresis/laser-induced fluorescence detection of the 1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate derivatives of the CSP hydrolysis products revealed almost exclusively the presence of glucose, mannose, and arabinose, as expected from the current knowledge of the carbohydrate contents of the mycobacterial cell surface. In contrast, no galactose was detected in the CSP extract. Because this compound is a specific marker restricted to the peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan-mycoloyl complex, this absence strikingly demonstrates that the integrity of the innermost envelope layer was unaffected by the mild extraction procedure used.The protein content of the CSP extract was further analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the complex pattern revealed by silver nitrate staining (Fig. 1A, lane 1) was very similar to that reported for Mtb H37Rv by Ortalo-Magné; et al. (19Ortalo-Magné; A. Dupont M.A. Lemassu A. Andersen A.B. Gounon P. Daffe M. Microbiology (Read.). 1995; 141: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although some of these bands have been identified in previous studies, the exhaustive protein content of these CSP extracts has been poorly investigated to date and remains quite elusive despite the considerable knowledge these molecules may provide in gaining a better understanding of the interplay between the pathogen and the host.Evidence of Potential Mycobacterial Glycoprotein Ligands of hPSP-A—To determine whether some proteins contained in the extract were recognized by hPSP-A, the precipitated CSPs of M. bovis BCG were resolved under denaturing conditions by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then incubated overnight with diluted human BALF. BCG CSPs recognized by hPSP-A were selectively detected through specific exposure of the bound hPSP-A to rabbit anti-hPSP-A antibodies. Under these conditions, four main bands at ∼50, 47, 45, and 30 kDa were clearly detected (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The results from incubation of a control membrane in sham buffer without BALF (Fig. 1A, lane 3) strongly suggest that the highest apparent molecular mass band (∼50 kDa), as well as probably the lowest apparent molecular mass band (∼30 kDa), can be attributed readily to nonspecific cross-reaction of the anti-hPSP-A polyclonal antibodies. With the aim of reducing this unwanted non-specific binding, the anti-hPSP-A polyclonal antibodies were tentatively pre-adsorbed on BCG cells before use. However, this procedure did not significantly reduce the adverse cross-reactions (data not shown), strongly suggesting that they may result from the recognition of some non-conformational epitopes naturally masked in the native “on-cell” presentation, but unveiled by the denaturing blot conditions.Finally, the two remaining bands at 47 and 45 kDa specifically labeled by hPSP-A were then considered as candidate ligands. To support this assumption, we first tried to demonstrate the presence of carbohydrate motives that were associated with these bands and that could account for the binding of hPSP-A at the molecular level. With this aim, the β-diol functions, solely predictable on carbohydrate rings (at least on the nonreducing terminal monosaccharides), were selectively oxidized by periodic acid, and the resulting carbonyls were chemically derivatized with digoxigenin hydrazide. The so-labeled glycosylated molecules were then revealed through detection of the digoxigeni"

However, the targets of Wnt signaling that convert this signal into bone are unclear. Identification of these targets will yield insight into normal bone physiology and suggest new therapeutics for treatment of bone disease. Here we show that an essential regulator of bone development, FGF18, is a direct target of canonical Wnt signaling. A single DNA binding site for the Wnt-dependent transcription factors TCF/Lef accounted for the stimulation of the fgf18 promoter in response to Wnt signaling. Additionally, targeted disruption of βcat blocked fgf18 expression in vivo. Partially overlapping the TCF/Lef binding site is a Runx2 binding site and experiments showed that Runx2 and TCF/Lef work cooperatively to induce fgf18 expression. RNA interference knockdown of Runx2 inhibited and Runx2 forced expression augmented the induction of fgf18 by canonical Wnt signaling. Significantly, Runx2 formed a complex with Lef1 or TCF4 and this complex bound the composite binding site in the fgf18 promoter. These results demonstrate that two transcription pathways that are essential for bone, physically and functionally converge at the fgf18 promoter.

Wnt signaling is initiated by the binding of the extracellular ligand (Wnt) to a seven-transmembrane spanning receptor and coreceptor. The receptor complex is comprised of frizzled, a multiple membrane spanning protein and an low density lipoprotein-related coreceptor, LRP5 or LRP6. The receptor-ligand complex initiates a complex cascade of events. Signals downstream of the Wnt receptor complex are separated into canonical and noncanonical pathways (4Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Canonical Wnt (cWnt) 2The abbreviations used are: cWNT, canonical Wnt; βcat, β-catenin; GSK3, glycogen-synthase kinase 3; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CBFβ, core binding factor β; HEK, human embryonic kidney. signaling regulates the protein levels of β-catenin (βcat). Within the cytosol βcat resides in a multisubunit complex that includes the proteins axin, APC, glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as well as others (5Fodde R. Smits R. Clevers H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt, GSK3 phosphorylates specific residues near the amino terminus of βcat, leading to its recognition and degradation by a βTrCP-dependent proteosome pathway. When Wnt engages its receptor-coreceptor complex, the protein disheveled is recruited to the membrane, phosphorylated, and directed to the APC-AXIN-GSK-βcat complex where it represses GSK3 activity. Inhibition of GSK3 leads to accumulation of βcat and migration to the nucleus. Within the nucleus βcat interacts with specific DNA binding transcription factors, most notably the TCF/Lef family of transcription factors (6van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). When associated with TCF/Lef, βcat recruits other transcription cofactors and stimulates the expression of Wnt target genes. The TCF/Lef transcription factors are a family of 4 proteins that bind to DNA through a conserved high mobility group domain (7Roose J. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: M23-M37PubMed Google Scholar). TCF/Lef proteins transduce cWnt signals into changes in gene expression. In the absence of Wnt, βcat levels are low and TCF/Lef proteins act as transcription repressors by recruiting the general transcription inhibitors Groucho/TLE and histone deacetylases (8Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2218-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 9Cavallo R.A. Cox R.T. Moline M.M. Roose J. Polevoy G.A. Clevers H. Peifer M. Bejsovec A. Nature. 1998; 395: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Accumulation of βcat in the nucleus leads to direct displacement of Groucho/TLE through the competitive binding of βcat to TCF/Lef (10Daniels D.L. Weis W.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). βcat activates gene expression by recruiting coactivators like p300/CBP (11Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the Mediator complex (12Kim S. Xu X. Hecht A. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14066-14075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). cWnt signaling has profound effects on normal cell and tissue development and directly contributes to pathological conditions like neoplasia. During bone formation and remodeling, Wnt signaling is indispensable. Studies of genetically modified mice have contributed much to our understanding of the many functions of Wnt signaling in the skeleton. Gene knockouts of individual Wnts have shown requirements for Wnt10b (13Bennett C.N. Longo K.A. Wright W.S. Suva L.J. Lane T.F. Hankenson K.D. MacDougald O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Development. 2003; 130: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and others during normal skeletal development. To study cWnt signaling during bone growth and remodeling, βcat has been conditionally inactivated in several studies. These studies have proven that Wnt signaling is required at several steps during osteoblast differentiation. Inactivation of βcat at early steps of osteoblast formation using cre recombinase expressed from the Dermo1, type I collagen, and Prx1 promoters caused aborted osteoblast differentiation (15Hill T.P. Spater D. Taketo M.M. Birchmeier W. Hartmann C. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 16Day T.F. Guo X. Garrett-Beal L. Yang Y. Dev.

Development. 2005; 132: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Early osteoblasts expressing the osteoblast transcription factor Runx2 were present, but mature osteoblasts and synthesis of bone matrix was absent. Other studies showed βcat requirements at later stages of osteoblastogenesis (18Rodda S.J. McMahon A.P. Development. 2006; 133: 3231-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 19Mak K.K. Chen M.-H. Day T.F. Chuang P.-T. Yang Y. Development. 2006; 133: 3695-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); mature osteoblasts failed to develop when βcat was deleted at a stage when the transcription factor osterix is expressed, indicating a requirement for cWnt downstream of or coinciding with osterix. In addition, cessation of cWnt signaling is required for osteoblast maturation (18Rodda S.J. McMahon A.P. Development. 2006; 133: 3231-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Finally, cWnt signaling also regulates bone osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by regulating osteoprotegerin expression (20Glass 2nd, D.A. Bialek P. Ahn J.D. Starbuck M. Patel M.S.

Naturally occurring mutations in humans have proven the relevance of Wnt signaling during osteoblast development and for controlling bone mass. A syndromic form of osteoporosis is caused by loss of function mutations in the Wnt coreceptor LPR5 (21Gong Y. Slee R.B. Fukai N. Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Reginato A.M. Wang H. Cundy T. Glorieux F.H.

Thus, in accord with the animal studies, Wnt signals are anabolic for bone and decreased Wnt signaling result in clinically significant bone deficiencies. These findings have proven the significance of cWnt signaling during osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, these studies suggest that careful stimulation of cWnt signaling or antagonism of βcat decay will promote bone formation. Identification of the Wnt target genes that are required for osteoblasts formation in response to cWnt signaling will also signify important pathways that can be modulated for therapeutic benefit of bone disease. In this report we show that the fibroblast growth factor 18 gene (fgf18) is a downstream target of cWnt signaling. FGF18 is expressed in a tissue domain that coincides with (i) sites of osteoblast development and (ii) regions where βcat levels (and therefore Wnt signaling) are increased. This implied that fgf18 is a candidate for a Wnt target gene that translates cWnt signaling into osteoblast differentiation. We find that fgf18 is directly induced by cWnt signaling. TCF/Lef proteins bind to a consensus target sequence of the fgf18 promoter and when stimulated by βcat induce fgf18 expression. Remarkably, the expression of fgf18 is directly coupled to another essential osteoblast transcription factor, Runx2. Partially overlapping the TCF/Lef site of the FGF18 promoter is a recognition motif for Runx2. Experiments showed that Runx2 interacts with TCF/Lef and forms a ternary complex at the FGF18 promoter. RNA interference experiments showed that Runx2 is necessary for stimulation of FGF18 expression by Wnt, demonstrating that Wnt signaling and Runx2 are both physically and functionally linked. These findings reveal exquisite control of fgf18 expression by two essential osteoblast transcription factors that combine to determine tissue specificity and stimulus dependence. These findings suggest that FGF18 may function as an essential component of the Wnt-dependent steps of osteoblastogenesis that are genetically downstream of Runx2. Reagents—SB216763 was from Tocris (Cookson, MO). Wnt3a conditioned medium was prepared from Wnt3a expressing L-cells according to the suppliers instructions (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Conditioned medium without Wnt3a was made using L-cells. Plasmids—To create the –3.3-kb fgf18 reporter plasmid a 3.4-kb MscI fragment of BAC clone RPI 23323L8 was blunt-end cloned into the SmaI restriction site of pGL3basic (Promega, Madison, WI). For the –1.1-kb reporter plasmid a PvuII/KpnI fragment was excised from the –3.3-kb plasmid and blunt-end ligated into the SmaI site of pGL3basic. The –0.8-kb reporter was prepared by SacI digestion of the –3.3-kb reporter that was cloned into pGL2basic rather than pGL3basic. The released fragment was gel purified and cloned into the SacI site of pGL3basic. MluI digestion of the –3.3-kb pGL2basic reporter resulted in a DNA fragment that was cloned into the MluI site of pGL3basic. To produce the trimeric repeats, gel purified oligonucleotides or 415-bp fragments having BamHI or BglII sites at opposite ends were kinased, ligated, and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The trimer was excised from the gel and cloned into the BglII site of pGL3 TATA, a TATA box containing luciferase reporter. pGL3 TATA was created by cloning the oligonucleotide AGATCTGGGTATATAAGGATCCGGTAAAGCTT and the reverse complement into the BglII/HindIII sites of pGL3basic. Lef1 was cloned into the StuI site of pCS2+ following MluI/HindIII digestion and Klenow fill-in of the image clone 6054813. Runx2 (form II) was PCR amplified from a mouse cDNA library using the primers CCGGTACCACCATGCTTCATTCGCCTCACAAA and TCTAGATCAATATGGCCGCCAAACAGACTCATCCATTCTGCCGCTAGAATTCAA and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations of the TCF binding site were introduced into the –1.1-kb and (415)3 reporter plasmids via QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The sequence of the mutagenesis primers is available on request. Metatarsal Cultures—Metatarsal were dissected from E15.5 day C57Bl/6 embryos and cultured in serum-free medium as described previously (24Kapadia R.M. Guntur A.R. Reinhold M.I. Naski M.C. Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 496-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When treated with Wnt3a, the medium was exchanged with conditioned medium (with or without Wnt3a) and the samples were harvested after 24 h. In Situ Hybridization—4-μm sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were processed and hybridized with riboprobes as described previously (25Naski M.C. Colvin J.S. Coffin J.D. Ornitz D.M. Development. 1998; 125: 4977-4988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FGF18 riboprobe plasmid was a gift from D. Ornitz (St. Louis, MO). Immunofluorescence—4-μm paraffin sections were prepared as previously described (24Kapadia R.M. Guntur A.R. Reinhold M.I. Naski M.C. Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 496-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution (β-catenin, Santa Cruz sc7963; and FGF18, Santa Cruz sc16830). Cell Culture and Transfections—MC3T3E1 (clone 14; Ref. 47Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and HEK293 were obtained from the ATCC and maintained subconfluent in α-minimal essential medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mm glutamine, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were transfected in triplicate using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity (26McEwen D.G. Green R.P. Naski M.C. Towler D.A. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30934-30942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Reinhold M.I. McEwen D.G. Naski M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase to control for transfection efficiency. Real Time Quantitative-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from cells using RNeasy according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). One μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed as described (28Reinhold M.I. Abe M. Kapadia R.M. Liao Z. Naski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38209-38219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Real time PCR was done using a SYBR Green PCR mixture (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The sequence of the primers were as reported (28Reinhold M.I. Abe M. Kapadia R.M. Liao Z. Naski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38209-38219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin was used as the normalizer. RNA Interference—The small interfering RNA oligonucleotide against mouse Runx2 was targeted to GTCCTATGACCAGTCTTAC. A negative control shRNA oligonucleotide directed against TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT, unrelated to Runx2, was used. The BD Knock-out RNAi System (BD Bioscience) was used for generating small interfering RNAs. Briefly, a double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide containing the shRNA and BamHI and EcoRI overhangs was cloned into the corresponding sites of RNAi-Ready pSIREN-Shuttle vector. The construct was verified by sequencing. MC3T3E1 cells were transiently transfected with shRNA plasmids using Nucleofection (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution T and transfected with 5 μg of DNA using Program T-20. Transfection efficiency using these conditions was shown to be >80%. RNA was prepared 24 h post-transfection from cells using an RNeasy (Qiagen) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—MC3T3 cells at about 80% confluence were stimulated for 4 h with 20 μm SB216763. Thereafter, protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pelleted at 1200 rpm, and solubilized in swelling buffer (5 mm Pipes, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture), incubated on ice for 20 min, and then Dounce homogenized. The nuclei were collected by microcentrifugation and then resuspended in sonication buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The samples were sonicated on ice with a Branson Digital Sonifier at 50% amplitude for three 10-s pulses to an average length of ∼1,000 bp and then microcentrifuged. The sonicated cell supernatant was diluted 4-fold with RIPA buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8) and precleared for 2 h at 4°C with 2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 30 μl of Protein G-Sepharose. Prior to use, Protein G-Sepharose was blocked with 0.2 mg/ml of sheared salmon sperm DNA and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin for at least 4 h at 4 °C. Precleared chromatin was incubated with antibody and rotated at 4 °C for ∼12–16 h. Antibodies used included anti-β catenin (sc-7963, Santa Cruz), anti-Runx C19 (sc-8566, Santa Cruz), and anti-HA (H6908, Sigma). Chromatin-antibody complexes were recovered using 45 μl of Protein G-Sepharose slurry. The bound complexes were washed with 1) RIPA lysis buffer (3 times), 2) RIPA lysis buffer plus 0.5 m NaCl (3 times); 3) LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris (pH 8) (2 times); and 4) TE buffer (2 times). The samples were then eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 and cross-links were reversed at 65 °C for 4 h to overnight. The samples were than treated for 1 h at 45 °Cin200 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris, pH 6.8 and 30 μg/ml Proteinase K. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. PCR was performed using FGF18 gene primers: 5′-CATTCTTTGGGAACCCCGCCTGCT-3′ and 5′-GGCTGGGTGCGCCGCGCCCACATC-3′ for 34 cycles (94 °C for 45 s; 69 °C for 45 s; 72 °C for 45 s). Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method (26McEwen D.G. Green R.P. Naski M.C. Towler D.A. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30934-30942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Reinhold M.I. McEwen D.G. Naski M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection the cells were lysed with 1% deoxycholate and 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 0.25 mm orthovanadate (Sigma), and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Clarified lysates were precleared with Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and then immunoprecipitated with anti-Lef1 (Santa Cruz; sc8591), anti-βcat (Santa Cruz; sc7199), or anti-hemagglutinin (Sigma; H6908) absorbed to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Blots were probed with anti-Runx2 (Santa Cruz; sc8566) and detected by chemiluminescence with the West Dura Extended substrate (Pierce). Nuclear Extracts and EMSAs—Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (26McEwen D.G. Green R.P. Naski M.C. Towler D.A. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30934-30942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Reinhold M.I. McEwen D.G. Naski M.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of extracts was estimated using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). All oligonucleotides encompassing the desired binding site sequences were gel-purified and subsequently annealed. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min in a 20-μl total volume, which consisted of 0.1 pmol of probe (25,000 cpm), 3 μg of bovine serum albumin (Promega), 1.25 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), 2–4 μg of nuclear protein extract, and buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9 (4 °C), 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Duplex oligonucleotide competitors (specific and nonspecific) were preincubated with the nuclear extract for 5–10 min at room temperature for competition assays. For supershift assays, antibodies were added to nuclear extract and incubated on ice for 20 min, followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min. The resulting complexes were resolved as described (26McEwen D.G. Green R.P. Naski M.C. Towler D.A. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30934-30942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Anti-Runx2 (sc8566X) was obtained from Santa Cruz. Animals—The Dermo-1cre deleter strain has been described (29Yu K. Xu J. Liu Z. Sosic D. Shao J. Olson E.N. Towler D.A. Ornitz D.M. Development. 2003; 130: 3063-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and mice carrying a floxed allele of βcat (30Brault V. Moore R. Kutsch S. Ishibashi M. Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Sommer L. Boussadia O. Kemler R. Development. 2001; 128: 1253-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals were maintained in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. We examined by indirect immunofluorescence the presence of FGF18 and βcat in metatarsal bone rudiments isolated from E15.5 mouse embryos. The rudiments were cultured in serum-free medium and differentiated spontaneously. Interestingly, FGF18 protein was found at sites in the perichondrium that coincide with sites of osteoblast differentiation and increased levels of βcat (Fig. 1, A and B, and color micrographs in supplementary data Fig. S1). We previously determined that FGF18 expression is induced following inhibition of GSK3 (24Kapadia R.M. Guntur A.R. Reinhold M.I. Naski M.C. Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 496-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that FGF18 is induced by cWnt signaling. In accord with this, fgf18 expression was induced in the perichondrum of metatarsals cultured in medium containing Wnt3a (Fig. 1, C and D) and in cultured cells (Fig. 1E). To further characterize the regulation of fgf18 by canonical Wnt signaling, we examined fgf18 expression in bones devoid of βcat. βcat was conditionally inactivated in the developing bones by crossing mice with floxed alleles of βcat (30Brault V. Moore R. Kutsch S. Ishibashi M. Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Sommer L. Boussadia O. Kemler R. Development. 2001; 128: 1253-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the credeleter strain Dermo1-cre (29Yu K. Xu J. Liu Z. Sosic D. Shao J. Olson E.N. Towler D.A. Ornitz D.M. Development. 2003; 130: 3063-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Consistent with the view that canonical Wnt signaling directly induces FGF18 expression, FGF18 transcripts were absent in the perichondrium of bones lacking βcat (Fig. 1, F and G). To identify the specific targets of Wnt signaling in the fgf18 gene we cloned various portions of the fgf18 promoter into a luciferase reporter vector. Transient transfection of these reporter constructs together with a proteosome-resistant form of βcat or following stimulation of the transfected cells with Wnt3a demonstrated that a 415-base pair motif between –0.8 and –0.5 kb is stimulated by βcat or Wnt3a (Fig. 2, A and B). This 415-bp sequence was sufficient to respond to βcat when cloned into a TATA box containing minimal promoter (Fig. 2C). Stimulation of this sequence by βcat was enhanced when the Wnt-dependent transcription factor, TCF4, was cotransfected (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the 415-bp motif is stimulated by cWnt signaling; therefore, we examined this sequence for putative TCF/Lef recognition sites (Fig. 2D). Three potential binding sites (A, B, and C) were identified. To test the function of these we designed oligonucleotides spanning these sites and determined if 1) the DNA sequence associates with the DNA binding domain of TCF4, and 2) βcat-dependent transcriptional activity is apparent in a transient transfection assay. Only site A interacted specifically with the DNA binding domain of TCF4 and showed transcriptional activity when cloned as a trimeric repeat in a luciferase reporter containing a TATA box minimal promoter (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover the activation of this sequence by βcat was blocked by a form of TCF4 lacking the amino-terminal domain required for interaction with βcat (Fig. 3B). We then mutated the TCF/Lef site to test its significance. Mutation of the consensus site completely abolished activation by Wnt3a (Fig. 3C) and βcat (data not shown), both of a trimer of the oligonucleotide containing site A, as well as a trimer of the entire 415-bp motif. To determine whether site A can account for activation of the endogenous fgf18 promoter, we introduced the same mutation into the TCF/Lef binding site of the 1.1-kb fgf18 promoter. This mutation also completely abolished the stimulation of the FGF18 promoter by Wnt3a (Fig. 3C), supporting the view that this site is fully responsible for the activation of the fgf18 gene by Wnt. To determine whether TCF4 and βcat interact with the FGF18 promoter in vivo we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation. Following stimulation of MC3T3E1 cells with or without the GSK3 antagonist SB216763 to mimic cWnt signaling, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed βcat associated with the FGF18 promoter (Fig. 3D, upper). Similarly, TCF4 were associated with the FGF18 promoter in HEK293 cells transfected with HA-tagged TCF4 (Fig. 3D, lower).FIGURE 3Identification of a TCF/Lef site in the FGF18 promoter required for stimulation by Wnt3a andβcat.

Here we used genetic approaches to modulate MKK4 expression in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF cells) and NSCLC cells to identify prosurvival signals downstream of MKK4. Relative to wild-type MEF cells, MKK4-null MEF cells were highly susceptible to apoptosis by LY294002, paclitaxel, or serum starvation. MKK4 promoted the survival of MEF cells by decreasing the expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN). MKK4 inhibited PTEN transcription by activating NFκB, a transcriptional suppressor of PTEN. MKK4 was required for nuclear translocation of RelA/p65 and processing of the NFκB2 precursor (p100) into the mature form (p52). Studies on a panel of NSCLC cell lines revealed a subset with high MKK4/high NFκB/low PTEN that was relatively resistant to apoptosis. Thus, MKK4 promotes cell survival by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through an NFκB/PTEN-dependent pathway.

Endogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 levels are also regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which phosphorylates the D3 position of phosphatidylinositol (PI) on PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 to produce PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 recruit the pleckstrin homology domains of specific intracellular proteins to the plasma membrane, an essential event in the activation of PI3K-dependent kinases such as phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and protein kinase B/AKT, which have a key role in cellular survival and transformation (2Katso R.

PI3K-dependent signaling is frequently activated in a variety of tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several genetic events previously described in NSCLC activate PI3K, including amplification of PIK3CA and activating mutations in PIK3CA, EGFR,or K-RAS (3Massion P.P. Kuo W.L. Stokoe D. Olshen A.B.

Of note, PTEN expression is transcriptionally suppressed by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) through NFκB (9Kim S. Domon-Dell C. Kang J. Chung D.H. Freund J.N. Evers B.M. J. Biol.

NFκB consists of the transactivation subunit RelA/p65 and the DNA-binding subunits p50 (NFκB1) and p52 (NFκB2), which are processed from the precursors p105 and p100, respectively (11Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). In unstimulated conditions, NFκB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitor of NFκB(IκB) and remains transcriptionally inactive. Upon stimulation by inflammatory cytokines or peptide growth factors, IκB is phosphorylated by IκB kinase (IKK), a multiprotein complex consisting of two kinase subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) and a regulatory subunit (IKKγ/NEMO), and undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation. The released NFκB translocates into the nucleus and regulates the expression of target genes with key roles in the prevention of apoptosis, promotion of tumor growth, and activation of inflammatory responses (12Dolcet X. Llobet D. Pallares J. Matias-Guiu X. Virchows Arch. 2005; 446: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). NSCLC cells undergo apoptosis in response to PI3K pathway inhibition (13Bost F.

We previously found that a stress kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4 (MKK4), activates prosurvival signals in NSCLC cells and can rescue them from the proapoptotic effect of PI3K inhibition (14Lee H.Y.

MKK4 is a dual specificity kinase that is activated by environmental stresses, including exposure of cells to UV irradiation, DNA damage, growth factors, or inflammatory cytokines (15Davis R.J.

However, the mechanisms by which MKK4 regulates cell survival have not been fully defined. In this study, we hypothesized that MKK4 promotes cell survival through interactions with PI3K-dependent signaling, which we addressed by using genetic approaches to modulate MKK4 expression in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF cells) and NSCLC cells. We conclude that MKK4 promotes cell survival by activating PI3K through an NFκB/PTEN-dependent pathway. Cell Lines and Reagents—The NSCLC cell lines H1299, H226B, H226Br, H332, H358, H460, A549, H596, and Calu-6 were obtained from American Type Cell Culture and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). MKK4-null and wild-type MEF cells (17Nishina H. Vaz C. Billia P. Nghiem M. Sasaki T. De la Pompa J.L. Furlonger K. Paige C. Hui C. Fischer K.D. Kishimoto H. Iwatsubo T. Katada T. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Development. 1999; 126: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. We purchased LY294002 (Calbiochem), paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.), TNFα (Leinco Technologies), l-α-phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (Sigma), and ImmunoPure immobilized protein A beads (Pierce). Antibodies—We purchased rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human Ser-473-phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT1), Thr-183/Tyr-185-phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), AKT1, X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (Cell Signaling Technology), and PTEN (Cell Signaling Technology and Neomarkers); rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p85α (Upstate Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p65, p50, cyclin D1, p110α, MKK4, and IκB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and mouse monoclonal antibodies to β-actin (Sigma) and p52 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Plasmids—NFκB-Luc was a gift from Dr. Bing Su (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). The p65 expression vector was provided by Dr. Paul Chiao (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center) (19Schmidt C. Peng B. Li Z.

Two PTEN promoter reporter constructs were used. One contains 1,064 base pairs (from –1809 to –745) and was provided by Dr. Alfred Yung (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center) (20Sheng X. Koul D. Liu J.L. Liu T.J. Yung W.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The other contains 1,978 base pairs (from –1978 to translation start site) and was provided by Dr. Ian de Belle (The Burnham Institute). Wild-type MKK4 plasmid constructs were a gift from Dr. Jiale Dai (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). Retroviral vectors expressing murine MKK4 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and scrambled control shRNA were purchased (Open Biosystems). Human MKK4 small interfering RNA and scrambled control small interfering RNA oligonucleotides were purchased (Invitrogen). pcDNA3-FLAG-PTEN was constructed by subcloning FLAG-PTEN into pcDNA3 at the KpnI and XbaI sites. Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis Assays—Cells were seeded in either 96-well plates (1,000 cells/well) for proliferation assays or 24-well plates (4,000 cells/well) for apoptosis assays. These conditions achieved 70% confluence at t = 0. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were either treated with LY294002 or paclitaxel at the concentrations indicated for 72 h at 37 °C or were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free medium for the indicated time points at 37 °C. After treatment, cell proliferation was examined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) assay. Depending upon the experiment, values were calculated relative to untreated wild-type MEF cells or empty vector transfectants, which were set at 100%. Apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling with the APO-BRDU staining kit (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA) or by Hoechst staining. For Hoechst staining, cells were serum-starved or treated with LY294002 or paclitaxel for the time periods indicated and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) was added directly to a final concentration of 10μg/ml. Cells were stained in the dark at 4 °C overnight and examined under a Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope the next day. For each treatment, cells with condensed or fragmented chromosomes, a hallmark of apoptosis, were counted in three randomly chosen fields. The percentages of apoptotic cells were then calculated based on the total cell count. Western Analysis and Kinase Assays—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (14Lee H.Y. Srinivas H. Xia D. Lu Y. Superty R. LaPushin R. Gomez-Manzano C. Gal A.M. Walsh G.L. Force T. Ueki K. Mills G.B. Kurie J.M. J. Biol.

AKT kinase assays were performed using a nonradioactive AKT kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. JNK and PI3K in vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (14Lee H.Y. Srinivas H. Xia D. Lu Y. Superty R. LaPushin R. Gomez-Manzano C. Gal A.M. Walsh G.L. Force T. Ueki K. Mills G.B.

The immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially in (a) phosphate-buffered saline, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100; (b) 100 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5 m LiCl, 100 μm Na3VO4; (c) 100 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm Na3VO4; (d) 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaPPi, 200 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.03% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (33 μm Tris (pH 7.6), 125 mm NaCl, 15 μm MgCl2, 200 μm adenosine, 15 μm ATP, 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). PI (Sigma) was resuspended in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) at 2 mg/ml and sonicated on ice for 10 min. The PI 3-kinase reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of the PI suspension. The reaction proceeded for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 m HCl. Lipids were extracted by 600 μl of chloroform: methanol (1:1). The organic phase was washed with H2O, collected, and dried by vacuum centrifugation. The lipids were resuspended in 20 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) and resolved on silica gel G-60 thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Merck) in chloroform:methanol:acetone:acetic acid:H2O (60:2: 23:18:11). Radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol phosphate was visualized by autoradiography. PTEN Phosphatase Assay—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors (Sigma). PTEN was immunoprecipitated using a PTEN-specific antibody (Neomarkers). The immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially once with lysis buffer (without protease inhibitors), twice with low stringency wash buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.7), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2) and once with Reaction Buffer without substrate (100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm dithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitates were then incubated in 50 μl of Reaction Buffer with 100 μm diC8PIP3 (Echelon Research Laboratories) at 37 °C for 40 min with occasional mixing. The beads were centrifuged, and 40 μl of supernatant were transferred to 96-well plates (flat bottom) and incubated at room temperature with 100 μl of malachite green reagent (Echelon Research Laboratories) for 30 min. PTEN phosphatase activity was calculated with a standard curve according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-Trisphosphate (PIP3) Assay—PIP3 was quantified in cell extracts using a PIP3 mass enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Echelon Research Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Cell Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Cells were transfected in 24-well plates with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure luciferase activity for the reporter gene assays, NFκB-Luc or PTEN promoter reporter vector was co-transfected with a pRL-CMV vector, which expresses Renilla luciferase as an internal transfection control. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection by a dual luciferase reporter system (Promega). Relative luciferase activity was expressed as the firefly luciferase activity normalized by the Renilla luciferase activity. For construction of site-directed mutants of the PTEN promoter, the reporter vector containing 1,064 base pairs of PTEN promoter sequence was used. For all other experiments on the PTEN promoter, the reporter containing 1,978 base pairs of PTEN promoter sequence was used. For stable selection, cells were seeded in 35-mm plates, transfected, incubated at 37 °C overnight, and then replated into 150-mm dishes, and G418 (Invitrogen) was added. Medium was replaced every 5 days. Up to 48 subclones were chosen for expression screening. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations in the PTEN gene promoter were created in putative NFκB binding sites at nucleotides –1574 to –1565 (Box 1) and –1450 to –1441 (Box 2) by overlapping PCR as follows. To create a Box 1 mutant, primers used were: primer A, 5′-CGGGGTACCGGATCCTCTTTCAGTTCATTTAGATAGGTGC-3′; primer B, 5′-TTTGCCTAAAGATTCAACCTTCCCCCAAATCTGTGTCCTCATGGTGTCAG-3′; primer C, 5′-AGGTTGAATCTTTAGGCAAAGGCTGTTACAGTCAAATCTCTGCGAACGAT-3′; and primer D, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCGGCCGCCGCCGTCTCTCATCTCCCTCG-3′. The mutant nucleotides are shown in bold. Using pGL3-PTEN-Luc as template, primers A and B were used to generate a 260-base pair PCR fragment, and primers C and D were used to generate a 710-base pair PCR fragment. The PCR products had 20-base pair overlapping sequences at the 3′- and 5′-ends. The PCR products were used as a template for a third round of PCR using primers A and D. The resulting PCR product, with the mutations in the Box 1 region, was cloned into pGL3-Luc basic vector. The same protocol was used to create mutations in the Box 2 region of PTEN promoter. For this PCR reaction, the primers used were: primer B, 5′-CTGCAAGGAGAATACAATCCCCCCTTGCCTCTACCCCTAGATTTCC-3′; and primer C, 5′-GGGATTGTATTCTCCTTGCAGGGACCGTCCCTGCATTTCCCTCTAC-3′. Primers A and D for this protocol were the same as those used for making Box 1 mutants. Northern Blotting—Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on 1.5% agarose gels in 1× MOPS buffer and transferred to Zeta-Probe blotting membranes (Bio-Rad). Probes to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and PTEN were prepared by PCR of cDNA prepared from total cellular RNA. PCR primers were described previously for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (22Lee H.Y. Suh Y.A. Lee J.I. Hassan K.A. Mao L. Force T. Gilbert B.E. Jacks T. Kurie J.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 2970-2975PubMed Google Scholar). The primers for PTEN were 5′-TTGAAGACCATAACCCACCACAC-3′ and 5′-GGCAGACCACAAACTGAGGATTG-3′. PCR products were labeled using the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Cells were treated with or without TNFα for the indicated times and fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. EMSAs were performed according to a method described previously (19Schmidt C. Peng B. Li Z. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Niu J. Schmidt-Supprian M. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Chiao P.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1287-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For typical NFκB binding activity, we used a 30-nucleotide double-stranded κB oligonucleotide from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (5′-CTCAACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGCCAT-3′; boldface indicates NFκB binding site). A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide (5′-CTCAACAGAGTTGACTTTTCGAGAGGCCAT-3′) was used to examine the specificity of binding of NFκB to DNA. To examine NFκB binding activity in the PTEN promoter, probes were made from two putative NFκB binding sites in that promoter (Box 1, 5′-TTGGGGGAAGGGGGAATCTCTAGGCAAAGG-3′; Box 2, 5′-CAAGGGGGGAGGGTATTCCCCTTGCAGGGA-3′) and their mutants (mutant Box 1, 5′-TTGGGGGAAGGTTGAATCTTTAGGCAAAGG-3′; mutant Box 2, 5′-CAAGGGGGGATTGTATTCTCCTTGCAGGGA-3′). As a control, we used Oct-1 probe, which has been described previously (19Schmidt C. Peng B. Li Z. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Niu J. Schmidt-Supprian M. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Chiao P.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1287-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP analysis was performed using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate) as recommended by the manufacturer. Following immunoprecipitation of protein-DNA complexes using anti-p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody or normal rabbit IgG, reversal of the histone-DNA cross-links, and recovery of DNA, purified DNA was then amplified by PCR. The protocol was as follows: denaturation, 95 °C for 5 min; amplification, 34 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and extension, 72 °C for 7 min. Primers were used (5′-CTGGGGAGCTGGTTACACAA-3′ and 5′-CTCCTGTTCTGGATCTGCC-3′) that spanned the mouse PTEN promoter region containing putative NFκB binding sites and generated a PCR product of 181 bp. PCR products were then resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel. Statistical Analysis—Paired Student's t test using Microsoft Excel was performed on the data from MTT assays, which were conducted in triplicate and repeated three times. Student's t test using Microsoft Excel was performed on the data from reporter gene assays and PTEN phosphate activity assay. p values of 0.05 or less were considered significant. MKK4 Loss Enhances Sensitivity to Apoptosis—We showed previously that MKK4-null MEF cells are more sensitive than wild-type MEF cells to apoptosis caused by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor (14Lee H.Y. Srinivas H. Xia D. Lu Y. Superty R. LaPushin R. Gomez-Manzano C. Gal A.M. Walsh G.L. Force T. Ueki K. Mills G.B. Kurie J.M. J. Biol.

Basal rates of proliferation (Fig. 1, left panels) and apoptosis (Fig. 1, right panels) were similar in MKK4-null and wild-type MEF cells, indicating that MKK4 loss had no measurable effects on these basal parameters. However, like LY294002 (Fig. 1A), treatment with paclitaxel (Fig. 1B), which is an antimicrotubule agent, or serum starvation (Fig. 1C) induced apoptosis of MKK4-null but not wild-type cells based on Hoechst staining. Apoptotic cells were also quantified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assays, which revealed that MKK4-null MEF cells were more sensitive than wild-type MEF cells to LY294002-induced apoptosis (supplemental Fig. 1). MKK4 Loss Increases PTEN Expression and Inhibits PI3K-dependent Signaling—Given that MKK4-null MEF cells were more susceptible than wild-type MEF cells to apoptotic stimuli, including treatment with LY294002, which inhibits PI3K, we hypothesized that MKK4 loss alters PI3K-dependent signaling, a key mediator of cellular survival, at the level of protein expression, activity, or both. Indeed MKK4-null MEF cells had higher PTEN expression (Fig. 2A) and lipid phosphatase activity (Fig. 2B) than wild-type MEF cells did. In contrast, PI3K expression (p85 and p110) and lipid kinase activity were similar in MKK4-null and wild-type cells (Fig. 2C), suggesting that basal activity of PI3K-dependent signaling was altered specifically at the level of PTEN. Because PTEN negatively regulates intracellular levels of PIP3, which is required for the activation of downstream effectors of PI3K, such as AKT, based on the above results we predicted that MKK4-null and wild-type MEF cells would differ with respect to the expression and activity of these downstream effectors basally or in response to LY294002. Whereas basal levels were similar in the two cell types, LY294002-induced PIP3 levels (Fig. 2D) and the phosphorylation and kinase activity of AKT (as measured using GST-GSK3 as substrate) (Fig. 2E) were considerably lower in MKK4-null MEF cells than in wild-type cells. LY294002 led to a slight diminution in PTEN expression in MKK4-null cells but remained higher than that of MKK4 wild-type cells (Fig. 2E). Thus, MKK4 loss was associated with an increase in PTEN expression and enhanced sensitivity to treatment with a PI3K inhibitor. Persistent AKT Phosphorylation in Serum-starved MKK4-null Cells—Because serum contains growth factors that maintain cell survival, in part through AKT activation, we reasoned that serum starvation would prominently inhibit AKT phosphorylation in MKK4-null MEF cells. Surprisingly whereas PTEN expression did not change in either cell type, serum starvation decreased AKT phosphorylation in wild-type cells but not in MKK4-null cells (Fig. 2F). AKT phosphorylation remained high up to 12 h after serum removal (Fig. 2F) at which time apoptotic cells were detectable (data not shown). We concluded that the apoptosis induced by serum starvation did not require AKT inhibition and hence occurred through a distinct mechanism from that of LY294002. Suppression of PTEN Expression Is a Prosurvival Signal Activated by MKK4—We next sought to rule out the possibility that PTEN expression and susceptibility to apoptosis differed in the two cell types due to MKK4-independent factors. MKK4 was added back to MKK4-null cells by the introduction of an MKK4 expression vector and depleted from MKK4 wild-type cells using shRNA. As a control we examined the phosphorylation of JNK, a substrate of MKK4. MKK4 overexpression in MKK4-null cells enhanced JNK phosphorylation, decreased PTEN expression, and attenuated apoptosis by LY294002 and paclitaxel (Fig. 3A). Conversely MKK4 knockdown in wild-type MEF cells decreased JNK phosphorylation, enhanced PTEN expression, and increased sensitivity to treatment with LY294002 or paclitaxel (Fig. 3B). Thus, the differences of the two cell lines in PTEN expression and sensitivity to LY294002 and paclitaxel were related to differences in MKK4 expression. We next investigated whether high PTEN expression contributed to the enhanced susceptibility of MEF cells to apoptosis. When PTEN was constitutively expressed in wild-type MEF cells by stable transfection, the PTEN transfectants were more sensitive than control cells to the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of LY294002 (Fig. 3C), suggesting that high PTEN expression contributed to the enhanced sensitivity of MKK4-null cells to LY294002. High MKK4 Confers a Survival Advantage in NSCLC Cells—Based on our observations in MEF cells, we hypothesized that the prosurvival effect of MKK4 that we observed previously in NSCLC cells (14Lee H.Y.

Whereas TRAF2, 5, and 6 are activators of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, TRAF3 is an inhibitor of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. The contribution of the different domains in TRAFs to their respective functions remains unclear. To elucidate the structural and functional specificities of TRAF3, we reconstituted TRAF3-deficient cells with a series of TRAF3 mutants and assessed their abilities to restore TRAF3-mediated inhibition of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway as measured by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) protein levels and processing of p100 to p52. We found that a structurally intact RING finger domain of TRAF3 is required for inhibition of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. In addition, the three N-terminal domains, but not the C-terminal TRAF domain, of the highly homologous TRAF5 can functionally replace the corresponding domains of TRAF3 in suppression of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. This functional specificity correlates with the specific binding of TRAF3, but not TRAF5, to the previously reported TRAF3 binding motif in NIK. Our studies suggest that both the RING finger domain activity and the specific binding of the TRAF domain to NIK are two critical components of TRAF3 suppression of NIK protein levels and the processing of p100 to p52.

TRAFs are thought to modulate a number of biological processes mediated by TNF receptors, ranging from cell survival and bone metabolism to immune responses through activation of intracellular signaling pathways such as NF-κB and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways (4Chung J.Y.

The canonical NF-κB pathway involves activation of the IκB kinase complex, leading to the degradation of IκBα, nuclear translocation of predominately the p50–p65 transcription complex, and activation of genes with pleiotropic roles in cell survival and immune and inflammatory responses (13Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar, 14Bonizzi G. Karin M.

Various domains in TRAF proteins have been characterized as important for activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway. The conserved TRAF domain at the C terminus of all TRAF members is critical for association with cytoplasmic tails of receptors, intracellular signaling proteins, and the formation of homo- or heterodimers (15Arch R.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The RING finger domain at the N terminus of TRAF2 and 6 has been shown to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is critical for induction of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway (16Takeuchi M. Rothe M.

Interestingly, TRAF1, the only TRAF member lacking the RING domain, functions as a feedback inhibitor of the canonical NF-κB pathway activated by tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (19Tsitsikov E.N.

Moreover, the zinc fingers of TRAF2 and 5 have also been suggested to contribute to the activation of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway (16Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D. J. Biol.

Despite sharing structural domains similar to TRAFs 2, 5, and 6, TRAF3 does not activate the canonical NF-κB pathway (9Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V.

TRAF3 has been shown to associate with TNF receptors (e.g. BAFFR, CD40, LTβR, RANK, CD30, and Fn14) that are activators of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway (23Hauer J. Puschner S. Ramakrishnan P.

Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TRAF3 inhibits p100 processing activated by these receptors (23Hauer J. Puschner S. Ramakrishnan P. Simon U. Bongers M. Federle C. Engelmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2874-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, TRAF3–/– cells exhibit constitutive p100 processing to p52, and more importantly the early postnatal lethality of TRAF3–/– mice was rescued by the compound deletion of the p100 gene (22He J.Q. Zarnegar B. Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Yamazaki S. Doyle S.E. Dempsey P.W. Cheng G. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2413-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, TRAF3 plays an essential role in regulating the noncanonical NF-κB activity in vivo. Activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway requires NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) to induce the processing of p100 (or NF-κB2) to p52 (28Dejardin E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1161-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Then p52-associated NF-κB complexes, predominantly p52-RelB heterodimers, are translocated into the nucleus and activate transcription of genes with preferential functions in lymphoid organogenesis (14Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar, 28Dejardin E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1161-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which TRAF3 negatively regulates the noncanonical NF-κB pathway is unclear. Several studies have suggested that TRAF3 suppresses p100 processing by inducing NIK degradation. TNF receptor activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway may involve inhibition of this TRAF3 function, allowing for an increase in NIK protein levels and resulting in processing of p100 to p52 via the proteasome (22He J.Q. Zarnegar B. Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Yamazaki S. Doyle S.E. Dempsey P.W. Cheng G. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2413-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the structural and functional specificities between TRAF3 and its close homologue TRAF5 in suppressing NIK protein levels and p100 processing to p52. We reconstituted TRAF3–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with a series of TRAF3 mutants including TRAF3/5 chimeric molecules and then examined TRAF3-mediated suppression of p100 processing. We report that both the RING finger and TRAF domains of TRAF3 are essential for its negative regulation of NIK protein levels and p100 processing. In addition, the TRAF domain of TRAF3 confers its specificity in suppression of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway by its association with the TRAF3 binding motif (T3BM) within NIK. Reagents—Anti-p100/p52 and anti-NIK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); anti-TRAF3 (M-20) and anti-GST (B-14) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-FLAG (M2) and anti-β actin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. The anti-hemagglutinin (16B12) antibody was purchased from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Constructs—GST-NIK(T3BM) was constructed as previously described (29Li C. Ni C.Z. Havert M.L. Cabezas E. He J. Kaiser D. Reed J.C. Satterthwait A.C. Cheng G. Ely K.R. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, synthetic DNA oligos corresponding to amino acid residues 73–94 of human NIK (GenBank™ accession number Y10256) containing the TRAF3 binding motif were annealed and ligated into the BamH1 and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T. Murine TRAF3 (GenBank™ accession number U21050), TRAF5 (GenBank™ accession number D78141), and mutant constructs were generated as described previously (8Saha S.K. Pietras E.M. He J.Q. Kang J.R. Liu S.Y. Oganesyan G. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Shiba T.L. Wang Y. Cheng G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3257-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Briefly, TRAF3 deletion mutants were cloned into pBABE-puromycin (pBABEpuro) or pBABE-puro-TAP (Tandem Affinity Purification tag) retroviral vector with an N-terminal FLAG tag. TRAF3/TRAF5 chimeras were constructed using standard overlapping PCR techniques and cloned into pBABEpuro-TAP. Double point mutants of TRAF3 were constructed using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and the pBABE-puro-TAP-TRAF3 vector as a template. Reconstitution—MEFs isolated from E14.5–15.5 embryos were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech Inc., Herndon VA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). To reconstitute TRAF3–/– MEFs, human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with Moloney Murine Leukemia virus-ΨA helper construct plus either pBABEpuro alone or the indicated pBABEpuro construct using standard calcium phosphate methods. TRAF3–/– MEFs were then infected with the filtered 293T cell supernatants followed by selection with 2.5 μg/ml of puromycin. Immunoblotting—MEFs were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) for 30 min on ice or lysed in 62.5 mm Tris·Cl, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. The cell extracts were then sonicated for 10 s using the Misonix Sonicator 3000. Equal amount of whole cell lysates was loaded onto a 7% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P™) and immunoblotted according to the manufacturer's recommended instructions. Blots were quantitated using Scion Image software, and the band intensities were normalized to background. GST Pulldown Assay—GST pulldown assays were performed as previously described (30Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Glutathione beads (Sigma Aldrich) were incubated with Escherichia coli-expressed GST alone or GST-NIK(T3BM) for 2 h. Glutathione beads were then washed and incubated for 1.5 h with lysates of 293T cells expressing the indicated TRAF3 or TRAF5 constructs. After washing, proteins were eluted from the beads and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Intact RING Finger and TRAF Domains of TRAF3 Are Required for Suppression of p100 Processing—Recently, TRAF3 has been shown to be an essential negative regulator of p100 processing to p52 (22He J.Q. Zarnegar B. Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Yamazaki S. Doyle S.E. Dempsey P.W. Cheng G. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2413-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To map the domain(s) in TRAF3 that are required for this function, we generated TRAF3 mutants with successive truncations at the N terminus (Fig. 1A). These TRAF3 mutant constructs were cloned into the low expression pBABE retroviral vector and were transduced into TRAF3–/– MEFs. We then assessed the ability of TRAF3 mutants to suppress noncanonical NF-κB activity by immunoblotting for p100 and p52 protein in the reconstituted TRAF3–/– MEFs. As seen in Fig. 1B, whereas wild-type MEFs showed low basal levels of p52, TRAF3–/– MEFs showed constitutive, high levels of p100 processing to p52. Reconstitution of TRAF3–/– MEFs with the full-length TRAF3 restored basal p100 processing levels. However, reconstitution with the N-terminal deletion mutants of TRAF3 failed to reduce the high basal p52 levels in TRAF3–/– MEFs to wild-type levels. All these truncation mutants lack the N-terminal sequence (amino acid residues 1–107) of TRAF3, indicating that this region is required for the negative regulation of p100 processing. Amino acid residues 1–107 of TRAF3 contain a RING finger domain that is thought to form a conformation necessary for zinc chelation. To determine whether an intact RING finger structure is required for TRAF3 to suppress p100 processing, we mutated the highly conserved cysteines and a histidine to alanines (C52A/C55A and C67A/H69A) to generate two point mutations in TRAF3 that disrupt the zinc-chelating positions of the RING finger (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, TRAF3–/– MEFs reconstituted with either TRAF3 (C52A/C55A) or TRAF3 (C67A/H69A) showed high basal p52 levels, like the TRAF3–/– MEFs reconstituted with the vector control. Thus, these two RING finger mutants could not restore the TRAF3-mediated suppression of basal p100 processing to p52 to wild-type levels. Collectively, these data suggest that proper folding of the RING finger domain is critical for TRAF3-mediated suppression of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. Previously, TRAF3 association with NIK via the TRAF domain was shown to be critical for suppression of p100 processing in a 293T cell line under conditions of overexpression (24Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). To further determine the role of the TRAF domain of TRAF3 in suppression of p100 processing, we reconstituted TRAF3–/– MEFs with a TRAF3 construct lacking the TRAF domain (Fig. 3A, T3(1–300)). As seen in Fig. 3B, TRAF3–/– MEFs reconstituted with the T3(1–300) mutant are unable to reduce the high basal p52 levels to the wild-type levels, indicating that this region containing the NIK binding site is indeed required for TRAF3-mediated suppression of p52 activity. Specificity of TRAF3 in Negative Regulation of p100 Processing—Among all the TRAF family members, TRAF5 shares the same domain organization as TRAF3 (1Grech A. Quinn R. Srinivasan D. Badoux X. Brink R. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, TRAF5 cannot functionally replace TRAF3 in suppressing p100 processing using our reconstitution assay (Fig. 4A), implying that different functions exist for the domains in these two TRAF members. To determine which domains of TRAF3 and TRAF5 are functionally interchangeable, we reconstituted TRAF3–/– MEFs with a series of TRAF3/5 chimeric molecules where individual domains of TRAF3 are substituted with the corresponding domain of TRAF5 (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C, reconstitution of TRAF3–/– MEFs with the TRAF3 chimeras containing the RING finger, zinc fingers, or isoleucine zipper of TRAF5 could reduce the high basal p100 processing to p52. Interestingly, the TRAF3/5TD chimera containing the TRAF domain of TRAF5 could not suppress the high basal p52 levels in the TRAF3–/– MEFs, indicating that the TRAF domain of TRAF3 is functionally distinct from that of TRAF5 for its ability to negatively regulate p100 processing. To confirm this observation, we replaced the TRAF domain of TRAF5 with the corresponding region of TRAF3 and found that this mutant TRAF5/3TD could now suppress constitutive p100 processing in TRAF3–/– MEFs (Fig. 4C). Thus, our studies have demonstrated that the difference in the functional specificity between TRAF3 and TRAF5 in negatively regulating the noncanonical NF-κB pathway is conferred by the C-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF3. Interaction of the TRAF domain of TRAF3 with the TRAF3 binding motif (amino residues 78–84) in NIK has previously been demonstrated to be essential for TRAF3 suppression of NIK protein stability (24Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Thus, one potential explanation for the functional specificity between the TRAF domain of TRAF3 and TRAF5 is that TRAF5 cannot associate with NIK at the T3BM. To test this hypothesis, we constructed GST fusion proteins with a 22-amino acid peptide encompassing the T3BM sequence (Fig. 5). We then performed a GST pulldown assay on TRAF3 and TRAF5. As shown in Fig. 5, unlike TRAF3, TRAF5 cannot associate with NIK(T3BM). The RING Finger and TRAF Domains of TRAF3 Are Required for Suppression of NIK Protein Levels—We have previously demonstrated that TRAF3–/–cells have an accumulation of NIK protein and that NIK is responsible for the constitutive p100 processing in TRAF3–/– MEFs (22He J.Q. Zarnegar B. Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Yamazaki S. Doyle S.E. Dempsey P.W. Cheng G. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2413-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have concluded that both the RING and TRAF domains of TRAF3 are required for suppression of p100 processing to p52. To test whether these domains are also important for suppression of NIK protein levels, we compared NIK expression in TRAF3–/– MEFs reconstituted with the TRAF3 RING finger mutants or the TRAF3/5 chimeras. As shown in Fig. 6A, reconstitution with full-length TRAF3, but not the vector control, suppressed the high NIK levels in TRAF3–/– MEFs. However, the TRAF3 RING finger mutants (C52A/C55A and C67A/H69A) failed to suppress NIK levels to the same extent as the full-length TRAF3, suggesting that an intact RING finger domain is important for inducing NIK degradation. Similarly, reconstitution of the TRAF3–/– MEFs with the TRAF3/5TD mutant or TRAF5 showed high NIK protein levels comparable with those of the vector control. However, TRAF3–/– MEFs reconstituted with TRAF3/5 chimeras T3/5RD, ZF, IZ, and T5/3TD showed greatly reduced NIK protein levels comparable with the cells reconstituted with the full-length TRAF3 (Fig. 6B). Moreover, NIK expression levels in these reconstituted cells correlated well with the amount of p100 processing to p52 (Fig. 6, A and B, top two panels). Therefore, the RING finger and TRAF domains of TRAF3, which are critical for inhibiting p100 processing, are also important for suppressing NIK protein levels. The structural similarities between TRAF proteins prompt the interesting question of the specificity of each TRAF protein in regulation of downstream signal transduction pathways. A specific example is that TRAF5 activates the canonical NF-κB pathway, whereas its closest structural homologue, TRAF3, functions as a negative regulator of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. In this study, we determined that the N-terminal domains of TRAF5, but not the C-terminal TRAF domain, are functionally interchangeable with those of TRAF3 in suppression of NIK protein levels and p100 processing. Furthermore, we clearly showed that an intact RING finger domain of TRAF3 is required for the suppression of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. Therefore, the TRAF and RING finger domains are two important determinants for the role and the specificity of TRAF3 in its negative regulation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. By reconstituting TRAF3–/– MEFs with two TRAF3 mutants (C52A/C55A and C67A/H69A), we observed that an intact RING finger domain is required for TRAF3 to suppress p100 processing to p52. The RING finger domain is a common motif found in many E3 ubiquitin ligases, including TRAF2 and TRAF6 (18Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 31Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that TRAF3 is also an E3 ubiquitin ligase, particularly considering that TRAF3 has been hypothesized to trigger NIK ubiquitination and degradation (24Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, thus far, we and other groups have been unable to demonstrate by in vitro assays that TRAF3 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for NIK (24Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Based on the previous work in isolating the TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase complex, there may be additional components that are required for NIK ubiquitination (18Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 32Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In support of this, Grech et al. (33Grech A.P. Amesbury M. Chan T. Gardam S. Basten A. Brink R. Immunity. 2004; 21: 629-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) have reported that TRAF2–/– B cells exhibit constitutive p100 processing to p52, suggesting that TRAF2 is also a negative regulator of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. We have examined whether TRAF2 can functionally replace TRAF3 in the suppression of p100 processing by retrovirally transducing TRAF2 into TRAF3–/– MEFs. As shown in supplemental Fig S1, TRAF3–/– MEFs with overexpression of TRAF2 still display high NIK protein levels and constitutive processing of p100 to p52. Hence, TRAF2 and TRAF3 perform distinct roles in suppressing the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, Act1 and TNAP, two other intracellular proteins known to associate with TRAF2 and TRAF3, have been shown to suppress CD40- and NIK-mediated p100 processing (34Qian Y. Qin J. Cui G. Naramura M. Snow E.C. Ware C.F. Fairchild R.L. Omori S.A. Rickert R.C. Scott M. Kotzin B.L. Li X. Immunity. 2004; 21: 575-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Hu W.-H. Mo X.-M. Walters W.M. Brambilla R. Bethea J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35975-35983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). How TRAF2, Act1, or TNAP negatively regulate the noncanonical NF-κB pathway and whether any of these molecules participate in TRAF3-mediated suppression of p100 processing has yet to be elucidated. Moreover, the mechanism by which TNF receptors such as CD40, BAFFR, and LTβR lead to activation of NIK remains controversial. Some reports suggest that CD40 and BAFF stimulation of B cell lines induces TRAF3 degradation, thereby allowing NIK accumulation and activation of p100 processing (24Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, this observation is inconsistent in the case of LTβR stimulation of MEFs or CD40 and BAFF stimulation of primary B cells where TRAF3 levels are not significantly reduced upon receptor ligation and induction of p100 processing to p52 (33Grech A.P. Amesbury M. Chan T. Gardam S. Basten A. Brink R. Immunity. 2004; 21: 629-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 36Kim Y.S. Nedospasov S.A. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2130-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These discrepancies point to the need for further experimentation to decipher the mechanism by which TRAF3 negatively regulates the noncanonical NF-κB pathway during homeostasis as well as during cell activation by TNF receptors. By reconstituting TRAF3–/– MEFs with TRAF3/5 chimeras, we have determined that the TRAF domain is the structural feature that differentiates the functionality between TRAF3 and TRAF5. In support of the significance and specificity of the TRAF domain of TRAF3, we observed that TRAF3, but not TRAF5, associates with the TRAF3 binding motif in NIK. These data correspond to the study by Liao et al. (24Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) that showed that the binding of NIK and TRAF3 at the TRAF domain is required for TRAF3 to induce NIK degradation. Together, this evidence suggests that a specific TRAF3 interaction with NIK is critical for regulating basal protein levels of NIK. Moreover, recent studies indicate that TRAF3 is also a positive regulator of the interferon pathway (6Hacker H. Redecke V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.-C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H. Hacker G. Mann M. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 7Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Guo B. He J.Q. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Perry A. Cheng G.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3257-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, TRAF3 functions not only as an essential regulator of basal noncanonical NF-κB activity but also as a critical mediator of the cellular response to viral infections. Interestingly, similar structural requirements and specificity were observed for TRAF3 in both of these functions (8Saha S.K. Pietras E.M. He J.Q. Kang J.R. Liu S.Y. Oganesyan G. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Shiba T.L. Wang Y. Cheng G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3257-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear what mechanism directs TRAF3 to act as an activator of the type 1 interferon pathway or an inhibitor of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. Future characterization of endogenous TRAF3 complexes involved in these two distinct pathways will provide us with a better understanding of the role of TRAF3 in the antiviral response and could possibly identify novel targets to treat immune disorders and cancers caused by constitutive activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway (28Dejardin E.

In addition to the well characterized PTAP late domain, the p6 region of HIV-1 Gag contains a binding site for the host cell protein Alix. To better understand the functional role of the Gag/Alix interaction, we overexpressed an Alix fragment composed of residues 364–716 (Alix 364–716) and examined the effect on release of wild type (WT) and Alix binding site mutant HIV-1. We observed that Alix 364–716 expression significantly inhibited WT virus release and Gag processing and that mutation of the Alix binding site largely relieved this inhibition. Furthermore, Alix 364–716 expression induced a severe defect on WT but not mutant particle morphology. Intriguingly, the impact of Alix 364–716 expression on HIV-1 release and Gag processing was markedly different from that induced by mutation of the Alix binding site in p6. The association of Alix 364–716 with HIV-1 and equine infectious anemia virus late domains was quantitatively evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance techniques, and the effects of mutations in these viral sequences on Alix 364–716 binding was determined.

This study identifies a novel Alix-derived dominant negative inhibitor of HIV-1 release and Gag processing and provides quantitative information on the interaction between Alix and viral late domains. An essential phase of the retroviral replication cycle involves the budding and release of nascent virus particles from the infected host cell. The budding process requires the trafficking of the Gag polyprotein precursor from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, currently thought to be the principal site of particle assembly in most cell types. During or shortly after virus budding and release, the Gag precursor protein is cleaved by the viral protease into the mature Gag proteins: matrix, capsid, and nucleocapsid. In the case of HIV-1, an additional domain, p6, is located at the C terminus of the Gag precursor. The protease-mediated cleavage of the Gag precursor is necessary for the formation of an infectious virus particle (reviewed in Ref. 1Freed E.O. Virology. 1998; 251: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Retrovirus budding requires that the virus co-opt the host cell endosomal sorting machinery. This is achieved through an interaction between a motif in Gag known as the late or L domain and a component of the cellular protein trafficking machinery (2Bieniasz P.D.

Interestingly, two groups have identified a region C-terminal to the well characterized P(T/S)AP late domain in HIV-1 Gag that is capable of binding Alix in vitro (18Strack B. Calistri A. Craig S.

Mutational studies of the Alix binding site indicate that whereas point mutations within a minimal Gag context reduce virus production 10-fold (18Strack B. Calistri A. Craig S. Popova E.

As mentioned above, retrovirus budding depends on the late domain-mediated hijacking of the cellular endosomal sorting machinery. The physiological role of this cellular machinery is to regulate the biogenesis of vesicles that bud inwardly from the limiting membrane of late endosomes to form structures known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (25Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Throughout all eukaryotes, the MVB pathway plays a central role in the physiological degradation of transmembrane proteins. This pathway packages transmembrane proteins destined for degradation into MVBs that subsequently fuse with the lysosome (26Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). The pathway is largely conserved in yeast, where it is used not only to direct transmembrane proteins to the vacuole for degradation but also to deliver newly synthesized lysosomal or vacuolar hydrolases to the vacuole (26Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Indeed, the core MVB machinery was first revealed through genetic analysis of protein sorting to the yeast vacuole (27Bowers K. Stevens T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 438-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Genetic defects in this pathway manifest as a class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) phenotype, characterized by the formation of an aberrant compartment known as the class E compartment adjacent to the vacuole. The MVB pathway is used in more specialized cell types for antigen presentation and exosome production, in which cargo is delivered to the cell surface rather than to the lysosome. Viral budding appears to be topologically similar to the exosome pathway (3Demirov D.G. Freed E.O. Virus Res. 2004; 106: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4Morita E. Sundquist W.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 395-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The class E VPS genes encode the subunits of three endosomal sorting complexes, ESCRT-I (Vps23, Vps28, and Vps37) (28Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D.

The remaining proteins and complexes are primarily responsible for the recruitment of specific cargo into the MVB pathway. Vps27, ESCRT-I, and ESCRT-II participate in the recruitment of monoubiquitinated proteins. Of these three, only ESCRT-I has been clearly shown to play a role in viral budding. As mentioned above, YPXL late domains and similar motifs in cellular proteins are recruited into the MVB pathway via their interaction with Alix (16Chen C. Vincent O. Jin J. Weisz O.A. Montelaro R.C.

Alix is a multidomain adaptor protein that contains the N-terminal Bro1 domain responsible for ESCRT-III binding and endosomal recruitment (37Kim J. Sitaraman S. Hierro A. Beach B.M. Odorizzi G.

Many of the interactions in the MVB pathway have been quantitated, and the structures of a number of the relevant complexes have been determined (44Hurley J.H. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 277-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the YPXL motif/Alix interaction in EIAV budding, this interaction has not been quantitated, and the determinants for binding are not well understood. The motif appears to be bipartite, containing both an N-terminal YPXL sequence and a C-terminal LXXLR sequence (Fig. 1). The relative contributions of each portion of the motif in different viruses are unclear. We therefore isolated the YPXL-binding domain of Alix (Alix 364–716) and quantitatively measured its binding to HIV-1 and EIAV late domains. We also examined the effect of Alix 364–716 expression on virus release and observed that this protein fragment acts as a potent dominant negative inhibitor of HIV-1 budding. DNA Constructs and Protein Expression—The wild type (WT) HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 was used in the cell-based assays. The p6 L41R mutant was reported previously (22Huang M. Orenstein J.M. Martin M.A. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6810-6818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); p6 L41A was constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis using methods described previously (7Goila-Gaur R. Demirov D.G. Orenstein J.M. Ono A. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6507-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The vector expressing Alix residues 364–716 (Alix 364–716) was constructed by PCR amplification of cDNA encoding Alix 364–716 using a forward primer containing the BamHI restriction site and a reverse primer containing the TAA stop codon and the SalI restriction site. The PCR product was subsequently subcloned into the pcGNM2 expression vector using BamHI and SalI. For in vitro assays, DNA encoding Alix 364–716 was subcloned into the parallel GST2 vector (45Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) using the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. DNAs encoding HIV-1 p6 and EIAV p9 were designed to be optimized for Escherichia coli expression and then synthesized using primers generated by DNAWorks 3.0 (NCI-Frederick): for HIV-1 p6, 1 (CTGCAGAACGGATCCCTGCAGAGCCGTCCGGAAC), 2 (AGCTTTCTTCCGGCGGCGCGGTCGGTTCCGGACGGCTCTG), 3 (CCGCCGGAAGAAAGCTTTCGTAGCGGCGTGGAAACCACCA), 4 (TCGGTTCCTGTTTCTGCGGCGGGGTGGTGGTTTCCACGCC), 5 (CGCAGAAACAGGAACCGATTGATAAAGAACTGTATCCGCTG), 6 (AGGCTACGCAGGCTGGTCAGCGGATACAGTTCTTTATCAA), 7 (CCAGCCTGCGTAGCCTGTTTGGCAACGATCCGAGCAGCCA), and 8 (CTGCAGAACGAATTCTTACTGGCTGCTCGGATCGTT); for EIAV p9, 1 (CTGCAGAACGGATCCCCGATTCAGCA), 2 (GCTTTTGTTATGCTGGCTTTTCTGCTGAATCGGGGATCCG), 3 (GAAAAGCCAGCATAACAAAAGCGTGGTGCAGGAAACCCCG), 4 (TCCGGATACAGGTTCTGGGTCTGCGGGGTTTCCTGCACCA), 5 (CCCAGAACCTGTATCCGGATCTGAGCGAAATTAAAAAAGAATATAAC), 6 (TCCACCTGATCTTTTTCTTTCACGTTATATTCTTTTTTAATTTCGCTCAGA), 7 (GTGAAAGAAAAAGATCAGGTGGAAGATCTGAACCTGGATAGCCT), and 8 (CTGCAGAACGAATTCTTATTCCCACAGGCTATCCAGGTTCAGATCT). HIV-1 p6 and EIAV p9 coding sequences were subcloned into the parallel GST2 vector using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. All Alix, HIV-1 p6, and EIAV p9 mutations were generated using QuikChange II or XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST-Alix 364–716, GST, GST-HIV-1 p6, and GST-EIAV p9 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown at 20 °C overnight. Harvested cells were lysed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), and the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Tobacco etch virus protease was used to cleave the GST fusion protein, and tobacco etch virus protease was removed by passing through TALON resin (BD Biosciences). Protein was concentrated and applied to a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Metabolic Labeling—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 1× glutamine, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C. Cells were plated overnight at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/well of a 6-well cell culture plate for virus release and electron microscopy (EM) experiments. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. To measure HIV-1 release efficiency, cells were labeled 24 h posttransfection with [35S]Met/Cys protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2.5 h in Met-/Cys- RPMI 1640 medium (Specialty Media) containing 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Virus Release and Gag Processing Assays—Virus release assays were performed as described previously (46Freed E.O. Orenstein J.M. Buckler-White A.J. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5311-5320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys, and virions were pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Cell and virus lysates were immunoprecipitated with HIV immunoglobulin (HIV-Ig) obtained from NABI and the NHLBI, National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Expression of virally encoded proteins was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Virus release efficiency relative to the absence of Alix 364–716 = virus release efficiency in the presence of Alix 364–716/virus release efficiency in the absence of Alix 364–716, where virus release efficiency = virus-associated Gag/virus-associated Gag + cell-associated Gag. p55/(p24 + p25) relative to the absence of Alix 364–716 = (p55/(p24 + p25)) in the presence of Alix 364–716/(p55/(p24 + p25)) in the absence of Alix 364–716, where (p55/(p24 + p25)) = cell-associated p55/(cell-associated p24/25). For detection of Alix 364–716 expression, cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE and subsequently trans-blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blotting was performed using rabbit anti-Alix polyclonal antiserum (kindly provided by W. Sundquist). The Alix fragment bands were captured using the Alpha Innotec FluorTec SP chemiluminescence imager, and the resulting data were quantified using the AlphaEaseFC quantification module. Analysis of EIAV particle release was performed essentially as described above, except that lysates were immunoprecipitated with horse anti-EIAV antiserum (kindly provided by R. Montelaro). Electron Microscopy—Cells were transfected for EM as for the HIV-1 virus release assay. Cells were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and fixed for EM analysis 30 h post-transfection as described previously (46Freed E.O. Orenstein J.M. Buckler-White A.J. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5311-5320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were examined by a Hitachi H7000 electron microscope. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was conducted as described previously (47Joshi A. Nagashima K. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7939-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 48Ono A. Orenstein J.M. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 × 104 HeLa cells were plated in Nalge Nunc slides overnight at 37 °C and transfected as described above. 24 h posttransfection, cells were washed with PBS and subsequently fixed for 30 min to 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde. After fixation, cells were washed four or five times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, quenched with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h. Cells were then washed four times with PBS, incubated with secondary antibody, and washed three times with PBS, and then the coverslip was mounted using Aqua Poly Mount mounting medium (Polysciences, Inc). Cells were then examined using the softWoRx visualization module on a DeltaVision RT microscope. Surface Plasmon Resonance—The binding of Alix 364–716 to WT and mutant HIV-1 p6 and EIAV p9 was measured with a Biacore T100 system at 25 °C with a flow rate of 20 μl min-1. The CM5 chip was activated using 1:1 N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide at a flow rate of 5 μl min-1 for 20 min. GST (30 μm) and GST-Alix 364–716 (30 μm) in 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0) were passed over separate flow cells at 5 μl min-1 for 40 min, and this was followed by a blocking step using ethanolamine (1 m, pH 8.5) at 5 μl min-1 for 20 min. All binding experiments were performed in Hepes-buffered saline buffer. Binding of Alix 364–716 to p6 and p9 was measured simultaneously by passing these proteins over flow cells coupled to GST or GST-Alix 364–716, with association and dissociation times of 100 and 300 s, respectively. Between injections of p6 and p9 proteins, surfaces were regenerated with an injection of Hepes-buffered saline supplemented with 500 mm NaCl for 15 s at 100 μl min-1. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The peptides DKELYPLTSLRSLFGN (HIV-1 p6–16) and QTQNLYPDLSEIKKE (EIAV p9–15) were obtained from New England Peptide at >99% purity. Alix 364–716 was dialyzed into 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and was used at a concentration of 20 μm. Peptides were dissolved in the same buffer and were used at 400 μm. Titration calorimetry measurements were taken using a MicroCal VP-ITC instrument at 25 °C. For studies of binding to full-length HIV-1 p6, WT or mutant proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Alix 364–716 and p6 were used at concentrations of 20 and 400 μm, respectively. The concentrations of HIV-1 p6 Y36A, Y36F, and LYP (35Odorizzi G. Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. J.

Peptides and full-length HIV-1 p6 samples were injected into 1.8 ml of Alix in 25 aliquots of 10 μl each at 240-s intervals. Data obtained from peptide injections into 1.8-ml buffer blanks were subtracted from the experimental data before analysis using Origin (Microcal). Affinities reported are the mean ± S.D. determined from three independent measurements. Overexpression of Alix 364–716 Interferes with HIV-1 Particle Production—Based on the findings that the central region of Alix binds the EIAV YPDL late domain (16Chen C. Vincent O. Jin J. Weisz O.A.

As controls, we measured the effect of Alix 364–716 expression on the release of HIV-1 mutants containing substitutions (L41A and L41R) in the Alix binding site. The data indicated that overexpression of Alix 364–716 strongly inhibited the release of WT HIV-1, with an ∼5-fold reduction in particle production upon fragment overexpression (Fig. 2, A and C). The fragment had significantly less effect on the production of L41A and L41R mutant virions (Fig. 2, A and C), suggesting that the effect of the fragment on particle production was due to its direct binding to Gag. Levels of Alix 364–716 expression were comparable between samples (Fig. 2B). We also observed that Alix 364–716 overexpression severely disrupted Gag processing, resulting in an increase in the ratio of Pr55Gag to p25/p24 (Fig. 2, A and D). Again, the effect of Alix 364–716 on Pr55Gag processing was mitigated by the Alix binding site mutations L41A and L41R (Fig. 2, A and D). Overexpression of Alix 364–716 also led to a consistent reduction in the cell-associated levels of WT but not L41A or L41R Gag (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, in contrast to the effects of Alix 364–716 e"

ZIPK is regulated by multisite phosphorylation. Phosphorylation at least three sites Thr-180, Thr-225, and Thr-265 has been shown to be essential for full activity, whereas phosphorylation at Thr-299 regulates its intracellular localization. Herein we utilized an unbiased proteomics screen of smooth muscle extracts with synthetic peptides derived from the sequence of the regulatory phosphorylation sites of the enzyme to identify the protein kinases that might regulate ZIPK activity in vivo. Discrete kinase activities toward Thr-265 and Thr-299 were defined and identified by mass spectrometry as Rho kinase 1 (ROCK1). In vitro, ROCK1 showed a high degree of substrate specificity toward native ZIPK, both stoichiometrically phosphorylating the enzyme at Thr-265 and Thr-299 as well as bringing about activation. In HeLa cells, coexpression of ZIPK with ROCK1 altered the ROCK-induced phenotype of focused stress fiber pattern to a Rho-like phenotype of parallel stress fiber pattern. This effect was also dependent upon phosphorylation at Thr-265. Our findings provide a new regulatory pathway in smooth muscle and non-muscle cells whereby ROCK1 phosphorylates and regulates ZIP kinase.

Our findings provide a new regulatory pathway in smooth muscle and non-muscle cells whereby ROCK1 phosphorylates and regulates ZIP kinase. The major mechanism governing the activity of myosin in smooth muscle and in many non-muscle cells is phosphorylation of its 20-kDa regulatory light chain (LC20). 3The abbreviations used are: LC20, 20-kDa regulatory light chain; SMPP-1M, myosin light chain phosphatase; ZIPK, zipper-interacting protein kinase; ROCK, Rho kinase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CRP, cleaved radioactive protein; MS, mass spectrometry; DAPK, death-associated protein kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; TERA, transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase; GEPH, Gephyrin; TCP, T-complex protein 1; PCCB, propionyl-CoA carboxylaseβ chain; ACTH, actin, γ-enteric smooth muscle.3The abbreviations used are: LC20, 20-kDa regulatory light chain; SMPP-1M, myosin light chain phosphatase; ZIPK, zipper-interacting protein kinase; ROCK, Rho kinase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CRP, cleaved radioactive protein; MS, mass spectrometry; DAPK, death-associated protein kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; TERA, transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase; GEPH, Gephyrin; TCP, T-complex protein 1; PCCB, propionyl-CoA carboxylaseβ chain; ACTH, actin, γ-enteric smooth muscle. In vivo the level of LC20 phosphorylation is dependent upon the opposing activities of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, myosin light chain kinase, and myosin light chain phosphatase (SMPP-1M) (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Hartshorne D.J.

Smooth muscles put considerable effort into regulating the respective activities of myosin light chain kinase and SMPP-1M. Inhibiting or activating either enzyme results in a net increase or decrease in LC20 phosphorylation and hence changes the contractile state of smooth muscle.

Other lines of evidence may cast doubt on a direct involvement for ROCK in regulation of MYPT1. First, the recruitment of ROCK to RhoA-GTP at the cell membrane raises both temporal and spatial concerns about the access of the kinase to myosin-bound MYPT1 (27.Miyazaki K. Yano T. Schmidt D.J.

Second, we and other groups have identified several additional MYPT1 kinases that phosphorylate MYPT1 at Thr-696/853 in smooth muscle and in other cell types. These kinases include ZIPK, identified by our group (29.Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Muranyi A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23441-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); integrin-linked kinase (29.Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Muranyi A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J.

Third and perhaps most intriguingly, neither the ROCK1 nor the ROCK2 null mouse has an obvious phenotype that would suggest a role in the regulation of smooth muscle contractility (30.Shimizu Y. Thumkeo D. Keel J. Ishizaki T. Oshima H. Oshima M. Noda Y. Matsumura F. Taketo M.M. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 31.Thumkeo D. Keel J.

Our laboratory has focused on ZIPK as a primary regulator of MYPT1 and myosin phosphorylation in smooth muscle. Evidence supporting a role for ZIPK in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction includes the following. 1) ZIPK co-purifies with MYPT1 and myosin in smooth muscle (29.Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Muranyi A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23441-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 2) ZIPK was identified as the primary binding target for MYPT1 in an unbiased high stringency two-hybrid screen using MYPT1 as bait (32.Endo A. Surks H.K. Mochizuki S. Mochizuki N. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42055-42061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 3) ZIPK is the major MYPT1 kinase activity present in muscle extracts (29.Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23441-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 4) ZIPK phosphorylates MYPT1 at Thr-696 and Thr-853 in vitro. 5) MYPT1 exhibits a low Km (∼2 μm) for ZIPK (29.Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Muranyi A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23441-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 6) Addition of recombinant ZIPK to permeabilized smooth muscle causes profound Ca2+ sensitization (29.Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29567-29574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 7) ZIPK phosphorylates the SMPP-1M inhibitor CPI17 as well as myosin light chain in vitro (29.Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29567-29574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). ZIPK is itself regulated by phosphorylation. We recently identified six phosphorylation sites on the protein: three that are required for enzymatic activity (Thr-180, Thr-225, and Thr-265), one that regulates nuclear localization (Thr-299), and two others of unknown function (Thr-306 and Thr-311) (34.Graves P.R. Winkfield K.M. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9363-9374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Prior to our work, Kimchi and co-workers identified six other potential ZIPK regulatory sites (Ser-306, Ser-309, Ser-311, Ser-312, Ser-318, and Ser-326) (35.Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 36.Shani G. Marash L. Gozuacik D. Bialik S. Teitelbaum L. Shohat G. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8611-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). More recently, Sato et al. (37.Sato N. Kamada N. Muromoto R. Kawai T. Sugiyama K. Watanabe T. Imoto S. Sekine Y. Ohbayashi N. Ishida M. Akira S. Matsuda T. Immunol. Lett. 2006; 103: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ZIPK is phosphorylated at Thr-265 in non-muscle cells treated with interleukin 6. Prior to these studies, our group had shown that ZIPK is activated and phosphorylated in smooth muscle following treatment with the Ca2+-sensitizing agonist carbachol (29.Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Muranyi A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23441-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The nature of the protein kinases that regulate ZIPK activity in smooth muscle are not known. Overexpression of at least one kinase in HEK293 cells, DAPK1, has been reported to activate ZIPK (36.Shani G. Marash L. Gozuacik D. Bialik S. Teitelbaum L. Shohat G. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8611-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Herein we used an unbiased proteomics screen to characterize major ZIP kinase kinase activities in smooth muscle and identified ROCK1 as a major Thr-265/Thr-299 peptide kinase. In vitro ROCK1 stoichiometrically phosphorylates ZIPK at Thr-265 and Thr-299, resulting in an increase in ZIPK enzyme activity. In a series of transfection experiments, ZIPK altered the ability of constitutively active ROCK to promote cytoskeletal reorganization. The following peptide substrates were synthesized and purified by Dr. John Gorka (Biomolecules Midwest Inc., St. Louis, IL): peptide T180, KKKKNIFGTPEFVAPE; peptide T225, KKKQETLTNISAVNYD; peptide T265, KRRMTIAQSLEH-SWIK; peptide T299, RRRLKTTRLKEYTIK; peptide T306, KKKEYTIKSH; and peptide S311, KKSHSSLPPNNSYAD. Phosphospecific antibodies were prepared from phosphosynthetic peptides derived from the Thr-180, Thr-225, Thr-265, Thr-299, Thr-306, and Ser-311 phosphorylation sites of ZIPK by Proteintech Inc. All other antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem. Vectors expressing various forms of ZIPK were prepared as described previously (34.Graves P.R. Winkfield K.M. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9363-9374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recombinant full-length and constitutively active forms of ROCK1 were either purchased from Signal Transduction Laboratories or purified as FLAG fusion proteins from transfected HEK293 cells. Analysis of ZIP Kinase Kinase Activity in Smooth Muscle−Whole porcine pig bladders (100 g) freshly isolated from male pigs were washed and incubated in Krebs buffer gassed with 95% O2, 5%CO2 at 37 °C and then treated for 5 min with 10 μm carbachol. The fully contracted bladders were removed from the medium, cut and stripped of their mucosa with a glass rod, and then plunged into a bath of liquid nitrogen. The frozen bladders were crushed into a powder under liquid N2 and homogenized in 2.5 volumes (w/v) of buffer A (4 mm EDTA, pH 7.2 at 25 °C, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm pepstatin, and 10 μm microcystin). The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g, and the pellet and supernatant (cytosolic fraction) were separated. The pellet (myofibrillar fraction) was re-extracted with 500 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 at 25 °C, 600 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors used in buffer A). After gentle stirring for 30 min at 4 °C, the myofibrillar fraction was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The cytosolic and myofibrillar extracts were mixed gently with 10 ml of γ-phosphate-linked ATP medium in the presence of 60 mm MgCl2 for 30 min (38.Haystead C.M. Gregory P. Sturgill T.W. Haystead T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The medium was washed with buffer B containing 1 m KCl and 60 mm MgCl2 and then incubated for 30 min with 20 ml of buffer C (buffer B containing 100 mm ATP, 150 mm KCl, and 60 mm MgCl2). The column eluate was collected, rapidly concentrated 3-fold to 1 ml by a Centricon filter (3000 × g using a 10,000-Da cutoff filter for 20 min each) to reduce the ATP concentration to <100 μm. The concentrated eluate was applied to a micro 0.5 × 1.5-cm Mono Q anion-exchange column equilibrated in buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 at 25 °C, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The bound proteins were eluted over 90 min with a salt gradient to 1 m NaCl in buffer D. Fractions (50 μl) were diluted 10-fold with buffer D and assayed for protein kinase activity. Greater than 95% of the total Thr-180, Thr-265, and Thr-299 peptide kinase activity measured was found in the myofibrillar fraction. Therefore, all subsequent studies were carried out on this fraction. Active column fractions from the myofibrillar fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Silver-staining proteins corresponding to peptide kinase activity were excised from the gel and treated with trypsin, and proteins were identified in an Applied Biosystems 4700 matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF-TOF) mass spectrometer as described previously (34.Graves P.R. Winkfield K.M. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9363-9374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Protein Kinase Assays−Reactions for protein kinase activity contained 10 μl of diluted fraction and 10 μl of peptide substrate (prepared from 2.5 mg/ml solution in buffer B) and were initiated with 10 μl of 300 μm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2 (2500 cpm/nmol). After 5 min at 25 °C, the reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 200 mm phosphoric acid, and 10 μl of the reaction mixture were spotted on 1-cm2 segments of p81 paper (Whatman), washed in 200 mm phosphoric acid, and Cerenkov counted. Phosphopeptide Mapping−All mapping studies with ROCK1 were carried out by incubating 200 ng of recombinant ROCK1 with 1 μg of ZIPK in the presence of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2 (2500 cpm/nmol) for 20 min at 25 °C. The 32P-labeled protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, silver-stained, and detected by autoradiography. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was determined by excising the labeled protein, Cerenkov counting, and dividing the amount of radioactivity incorporated by the specific activity of ATP in the reaction. The precise sites were mapped by reverse phase HPLC and CRP analysis following extraction of proteolytic fragments from the gel as described previously (29.Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Muranyi A.

Cell Culture, Transfection, Purification of Recombinant ZIPK, and Fluorescence Microscopy−HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Protocols for transfection and purification of FLAG-ZIPK and the mutants used in this study are described in Graves et al. (34.Graves P.R. Winkfield K.M. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9363-9374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For microscopic analysis, cells were plated onto glass coverslips and transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), and lysed in 0.2% Triton. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 568 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Analysis of ZIP Kinase Kinase Activity within the Smooth Muscle Purinome−To characterize and identify ZIP kinase kinase activities in smooth muscle, a series of synthetic peptide substrates were derived from the primary amino acid sequence surrounding the major regulatory phosphorylation sites on ZIPK, Thr-180, Thr-265, and Thr-299. Additionally because ZIPK can autophosphorylate, assays were also carried out on a synthetic peptide derived from the amino acid sequence of Thr-696 from MYPT1 (29.Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Muranyi A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23441-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A combination of ATP affinity and anion-exchange chromatography was used to rapidly separate out various kinase components within smooth muscle and more readily define ZIP kinase kinase activity. Fig. 1A shows that assay of anion-exchange column fractions with both Thr-265- and Thr-299-containing peptides identified a major peak of kinase activity eluting between fractions 32 and 40. In contrast, assay with MYPT1T696 identified two peaks of kinase activity, the first co-eluting Thr-265/Thr-299 activity and the second between fractions 42 and 48. Previously we have shown that the major MYPT1T696 activity present in smooth muscle extracts corresponds to two forms of ZIPK, a 54-kDa form and a 32-kDa proteolytic fragment (29.Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Muranyi A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23441-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Assay with ZIPKT180 peptide characterized a small peak of activity eluting between fractions 32 and 40. To identify the types of protein kinases co-eluting across fractions 32-40, the fractions were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and characterized by silver staining (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows that fractions 34-39 contained several proteins of varying molecular weight and abundance. To characterize the compliment of proteins contained in each gel lane, each silver-staining protein band was excised and digested with trypsin as described previously (39.Graves P.R. Kwiek J.J. Fadden P. Ray R. Hardeman K. Coley A.M. Foley M. Haystead T.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1364-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Following extraction from the gel slices, tryptic peptide mixtures were analyzed by high through-put mass spectrometry using in an Applied Biosystems MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer. Because individual stained gel bands were likely to contain several proteins of varying abundance, the extracted tryptic peptides were analyzed first by peptide mass fingerprinting followed by extensive MS/MS analysis of all peptides identified with a signal to noise ratio >5. The compiled raw peptide mass fingerprinting and MS/MS data were searched against the public databases to identify their protein content (supplemental data I). To ensure unambiguous identification resulting from peptide mass redundancy or other known mass spectrometric related artifacts, stringent search criteria were applied, requiring multiple peptide matches within a given peptide mass fingerprint for an identified protein plus a minimum of two separate MS/MS matches. Using this approach 95 peptide mass fingerprinting spectra and 736 MS/MS spectra were collected identifying over 40 different proteins co-eluting throughout fractions 34-39. Importantly our MS analysis showed that many of the excised gel bands contained multiple proteins. For example band 11 contained three distinct proteins (Gephyrin, ROCK2, and Golgin 1) all showing multiple distinct peptide mass and MS/MS matches (see supplemental data I). Comparison of the average MS signal intensity of digests containing mixtures demonstrated that most proteins could be unambiguously identified over a differential concentration range of ∼5-10-fold. These data demonstrate that our MS-based approach can be used to identify multiple proteins of varying abundance co"

Ovarian carcinoma cells preferentially adhere to interstitial collagen, and collagen-induced integrin clustering up-regulates the expression of the transmembrane collagenase membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). Collagenolytic activity is important in intraperitoneal metastasis, potentiating invasion through the mesothelial cell layer and colonization of the submesothelial collagen-rich matrix. The objective of this study was to elucidate a potential mechanistic link between collagen adhesion and MT1-MMP expression. Our results indicate that culturing cells on three-dimensional collagen gels, but not thin layer collagen or synthetic threedimensional hydrogels, results in rapid induction of the transcription factor EGR1. Integrin signaling through a SRC kinase-dependent pathway is necessary for EGR1 induction. Silencing of EGR1 expression using small interfering RNA abrogated collagen-induced MT1-MMP expression and inhibited cellular invasion of three-dimensional collagen gels. These data support a model for intraperitoneal metastasis wherein collagen adhesion and clustering of collagen binding integrins activates integrin-mediated signaling via SRC kinases to induce expression of EGR1, resulting in transcriptional activation of the MT1-MMP promoter and subsequent MT1-MMP-catalyzed collagen invasion. This model highlights the role of unique interactions between ovarian carcinoma cells and interstitial collagens in the ovarian tumor microenvironment in inducing gene expression changes that potentiate intraperitoneal metastatic progression.

Approximately 10% of all epithelial ovarian carcinomas are hereditary and may be facilitated by gene mutations, whereas the remaining 90% are sporadic (2.Narod S.A. Ford D. Devilee P.

Tumors are thought to arise from the single cell layer of the ovarian epithelium and metastasis occurs via direct extension into the peritoneal cavity, where shed cells from the primary tumor are found as a component of malignant ascites. Secondary tumors arise as a consequence of CD44- and integrin-mediated intra-peritoneal adhesion and localized invasion into the interstitial collagen-rich submesothelial matrix. Proteolytic activity is important at multiple stages in intraperitoneal metastasis, including disruption of cell-cell interactions, migration and invasion into the mesothelial cell layer, and the submesothelial matrix to anchor secondary lesions, and for subsequent tumor-mediated angiogenesis (7.Ghosh S. Wu Y. Stack M.S. Cancer Treat. Res. 2002; 107: 331-351PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple studies have shown that microenvironmental contacts with stromal cells or extracellular matrix elements may play a major role in tumor progression by inducing epigenetic changes in transformed cells (8.Roskelley C.D. Bissell M.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9.Bissell M.J. Radisky D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Metastasizing ovarian cancer cells encounter a collagen-rich environment, as the submesothelial matrix is comprised primarily of interstitial collagens (types I and III) and ovarian tumors induce a fibro-proliferative response characterized by increased synthesis of collagen in the peritoneal cavity (10.Harvey W. Amlot P.L. J. Pathol. 1983; 139: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11.Stylianou E. Jenner L.A. Davies M. Coles G.A. Williams J.D.

Model experiments using microbeads containing immobilized integrin subunit-specific antibodies, to mimic matrix-induced integrin aggregation, showed that clustering of β1-integrins induced expression of the transmembrane collagenase designated membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) 3The abbreviations used are: MT1-MMP, membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; EGR1, early growth response protein 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.3The abbreviations used are: MT1-MMP, membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; EGR1, early growth response protein 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. as well as MT1-MMP-mediated activation of pro-MMP2 (14.Ellerbroek S.M.

As invasion of three-dimensional collagen matrices by ovarian cancer cells is potentiated by MT1-MMP collagenolytic activity (14.Ellerbroek S.M. Wu Y.I. Overall C.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24833-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), these data support integrin-mediated collagen adhesion as an important microenvironmental regulator of ovarian cancer metastasis. Because of its role as an in vivo collagenase, the activity of MT1-MMP is stringently regulated via multiple mechanisms including transcriptional and post-translational control (15.Munshi H.G. Stack M.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006; 25: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Previous data from our laboratory suggested that collagen-induced expression of MT1-MMP in ovarian cancer cells was regulated, in part, at the level of transcription (5.Narod S.A. Madlensky L. Bradley L. Cole D. Tonin P. Rosen B. Risch H.A. Cancer. 1994; 74: 2341-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); however, in contrast to other members of the MMP family, relatively little is known regarding transcriptional control of MT1-MMP expression (20.Ning W.

Our results support a model wherein β1 integrin signaling via a SRC kinase-dependent pathway can potentiate intra-peritoneal metastasis by rapid induction of the early growth response protein (EGR1), inducing transcriptional activation of the MT1-MMP promoter and subsequent MT1-MMP-mediatated collagen invasion. Immunohistochemistry−Immunohistochemical analysis was done retrospectively on tumor tissue microarrays prepared by the Pathology Core Facility of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University assembled from tissue originally taken for routine diagnostic purposes. The microarray tissue specimens included 149 human ovarian carcinomas (77 serous, 45 endometroid, 9 mucinous, and 18 clear cell). Samples were cut 3-4-μm thick and deparaffinized. The cores were 1 mm in diameter. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by heat induction at 99 °C for ∼45 min. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to MT1-MMP (Neomarkers, Kalamazoo, MI, clone RB-1544B raised against a peptide from the second quarter of MT1-MMP) at 1:100 dilution was done according to standard procedures. Breast carcinoma was used as a positive control for MT1-MMP. Analysis of tissue sections was done by light microscopy by an anatomic pathologist (B. P. A.) without prior knowledge of the clinical variables. Scoring of MT1-MMP was assigned according to the average overall intensity of the staining and was graded as follows: 0, no staining; 1, fine granular staining; 2, somewhat coarse staining, but less than positive control tissue (human placenta); 3, very coarse staining, similar to positive control tissue. Staining <10% of tumor cells, regardless of intensity, was considered negative. Staining of between 10 and 75% of tumor cells was considered focal positive, and staining of greater than 75% of tumor cells was considered diffuse positive. Statistical analyses were performed by the Biostatistics Core Facility of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center. Materials−Polyclonal anti-early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) recognizing 58-kDa human EGR1 was purchased from Aviva Systems Biology (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (clone TUB2.1), polyclonal anti-matrix metalloproteinase-14 (hinge region), anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, and bacterial collagenase were obtained from Sigma. Phospho-SRC family (Tyr-416) and c-SRC polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Rat tail type I collagen and BDPuraMatrix Peptide Hydrogel were purchased from BD Biosciences. The kinase inhibitors PP2, PP3, PD98059, SB203580, wortmannin, and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. The broad-spectrum inhibitor of metalloproteinases GM6001 and a function blocking mouse anti-human integrin β1 monoclonal antibody (mAb 1959) were obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Cell Culture−The ovarian carcinoma cell line DOV13 was provided by Dr. R. Bast, Jr. (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). DOV13 cell culture was maintained in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro, Mediatech), amphotericin B (Cellgro, Mediatech), nonessential amino acids (Cellgro, Mediatech), sodium pyruvate (Cellgro, Mediatech), and insulin from bovine pancreas (10 mg/liter; Sigma) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (16.Moser T.L. Pizzo S.V. Bafetti L.M. Fishman D.A. Stack M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Normal immortalized ovarian epithelial cell line IOSE398 was provided by Dr. N. Auersperg (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) and maintained for no longer then 10 passages in a 1:1 mixture of media 199 (Sigma) and MCDB105 (Sigma), 5% fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma). Three-dimensional Culture Model of Ovarian Cancer Metastasis−To mimic initial stages of submesothelial matrix invasion by ovarian cancer cells, cells in suspension were plated atop of a three-dimensional collagen I gel. Three-dimensional collagen I gels were prepared by mixing rat tail type I collagen to the final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml with serum-free medium and solidified by polymerization for 30 min at 37 °C. Control cells were plated on thin layer collagen I (two-dimensional collagen I) prepared by coating tissue culture plates by passive adsorption with a dilute (10 μg/ml) solution of rat tail collagen I overnight. Prior to inducing matrix contact, cells were subjected to 20-24 h serum starvation, suspended with trypsin, neutralized with soybean trypsin inhibitor, resuspended in serum-free media, and subsequently plated atop three-dimensional or two-dimensional type I collagen surfaces for the indicated time points. Before collecting cells, media was removed by aspiration, plates were placed on ice and treated with 0.1 mg/ml collagenase solution in phosphate-buffered saline to remove collagen followed by scraping from the plate. The remaining collagen gel was sheared by pipeting and further disrupted by brief incubation (up to 5 min at 37 °C) with the above collagenase solution. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 rpm at 4 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged as above to collect. Inhibitors−The kinase inhibitors PP2, PP3, PD98059, SB203580, wortmannin, and LY294002 were used at concentrations 10, 10, 50, 25, 0.1, and 25 μm, respectively, for all experiments. As determined by trypan blue (Sigma) staining, cells were viable at these conditions. Where applicable, inhibitors were also co-polymerized into three-dimensional collagen gels. Prior to the experiment, starved cells were pretreated with the inhibitors for 1 h. Gelatin Zymography−Gelatinase activities in conditioned media were determined by SDS-PAGE zymography as previously described (17.Moser T.L. Young T.N. Rodriguez G.C. Pizzo S.V. Bast Jr., R.C. Stack M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 56: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Gels were prepared with 9% acrylamide and 0.1% gelatin, samples were electrophoresed without reduction (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). SDS was removed from the gel through a 30-min incubation in 2.5% Triton X-100. To initiate gelatinase activity, gels were incubated in 100 ml of 20 mm glycine, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm ZnCl2, pH 8.3, at 37 °C for 24-48 h prior to staining for protein. Developed gels were dried and scanned using Epson Perfection 1640SU and Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. Western Blotting−Cells incubated under various conditions were collected as described above and lysed with buffer (TBST) containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche). Cell lysates (20 μg) were electrophoresed on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (19.Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST (25 mmol/liter of Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter of NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature (20 °C). Membranes were incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature with antibodies derived against proteins of interest. The antibodies were used at the following dilutions: 1:1000 for anti-human hinge region MT1-MMP polyclonal antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST, 1:500 for anti-human EGR1 polyclonal antibody in 5% skim milk in TBST, 1:500 for anti-phospho-SRC (Tyr-416) polyclonal antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST, 1:500 for anti-total SRC polyclonal antibody in 5% skim milk in TBST, 1:1000 for anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody in 5% skim milk in TBST. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with an anti-(rabbit IgG)-peroxidase or anti-(mouse IgG)-peroxidase (1:1000 in 5% skim milk in TBST) and enhanced chemiluminescence using LAS3000 (Fujifilm) and LAS3000 ImageReader software. Band intensities were determined using LAS3000 ImageGauge software according to the manufacturer’s instructions. mRNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis−Total mRNA was purified from 1 to 2 × 106 cells using the Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). mRNA purification and cDNA synthesis experiments were repeated three times. Quantitative Real Time PCR−Real time PCR was carried out with the LightCycler RT-PCR System (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SYBR Green was used for quantitative PCR as a double-stranded DNA-specific fluorophore. The PCR was conducted by initial denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s using the iTaq SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). To determine the specificity of the PCR primers, melting curves were collected by heating the products at 95 °C, then cooling down to 65 °C, and then slowly melting at 0.5 °C/s up to 95 °C. Primer sequences for EGR1 mRNA detection were according to the previously published sequences (20.Ning W. Li C.J. Kaminski N. Feghali-Bostwick C.A. Alber S.M. Di Y.P. Otterbein S.L. Song R. Hayashi S. Zhou Z. Pinsky D.J. Watkins S.C. Pilewski J.M. Sciurba F.C. Peters D.G. Hogg J.C. Choi A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Sequences of other primers used for the real-time RT-PCR were constructed according to the requirements for primers used for real time RT-PCR (supplemental Table 1). Efficiency of amplification was determined using the standard curves method. Relative quantification of gene expression between experimental (three-dimensional collagen I) and control (two-dimensional collagen I) samples was measured by normalization against endogenous RPL-19 using the ΔCT method (21.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121148) Google Scholar). Prior to using RPL-19 as a control, it has been established that its expression correlated well with the total RNA concentration and did not change with the time and treatment used in our studies. -Fold changes were quantified as 2-(ΔCTsample-ΔCTcontrol) as described previously (21.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121148) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections−Transient transfections were performed using lipofection method with ExGene (Fermentas) as a vehicle. EGR1 and control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were transiently transfected into DOV13 cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cellular Invasion Assay−Invasion assays were performed using Transwell chambers (0.8 μm, BD Biosciences) as described before (14.Ellerbroek S.M. Wu Y.I. Overall C.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24833-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In brief, Transwell inserts were coated on the bottom with a thin layer of human collagen (Sigma) as a chemoattractant for 1 h at 37 °C. The inner well of the filters contained 20 μg of human collagen that was allowed to air dry overnight. Cells (70,000) were plated in the collagen-coated inserts, and allowed to invade the collagen gel for 18-24 h at 37 °C. Filters were collected and the cells adhering to the lower surface were fixed and stained using the Diff-Quik staining kit (Dade Behring) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells in several random fields were counted and averaged. Invading cells were expressed as a percent of total cells added to the invasion chamber. Analysis of MT1-MMP Expression in Human Ovarian Carcinoma−The normal ovarian surface epithelium does not express MMPs and MT1-MMP is not detected in benign tumors; however, MT1-MMP has been detected in malignant ovarian tumors (22.Davidson B. Goldberg I. Gotlieb W.H. Kopolovic J. Ben-Baruch G. Nesland J.M. Berner A. Bryne M. Reich R. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23.Afzal S.

Sharp F. Mason P. Blacket T. Berek J. Ovarian Cancer III. Chapman Hall, London1994: 157-169Google Scholar). To evaluate MT1-MMP expression in a large patient cohort, samples from 149 patients were examined for MT1-MMP immunoreactivity. Of these samples, 77 (52%) were serous carcinoma, 45 (30%) were endometrioid carcinoma, 18 (12%) were clear cell carcinoma, and 9 (6%) were mucinous carcinoma. The vast majority of ovarian tumors (78%) displayed positive MT1-MMP immunoreactivity (Table 1, Fig. 1). Staining, with the exception of 17 serous carcinomas, 11 endometrioid carcinomas, and one mucinous carcinoma, was typically diffuse (expression in greater than 75% of tumor cells). MT1-MMP expression was high (3+ or 2+) in 52% of patients. Representative examples of serous, endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous ovarian tumors with intense MT1-MMP immunoreactivity are shown in Fig. 1. It is interesting to note that in clear cell carcinoma, the most invasive histotype, MT1-MMP, is expressed at high levels in 94% of cases (Table 1). No significant MT1-MMP staining was observed in the stromal compartment. Strong MT1-MMP positivity (3+ or 2+) was not differentially distributed according to Fédération Internationale des Gynaecologistes et Obstetristes stage.TABLE 1Immunohistochemical analysis of MT1-MMP expression in epithelial ovarian tumorsHistotype3+2+1+0Serous (77)8 (10%)24 (31%)24 (31%)21 (28%)Endometrioid (45)4 (9%)19 (42%)10 (22%)12 (27%)Clear cell (18)3 (17%)14 (78%)0 (0%)1 (5%)Mucinous (9)2 (22%)3 (34%)2 (22%)2 (22%) Open table in a new tab β1 Integrin-mediated MT1-MMP Expression on Three-dimensional Type I Collagen−Ovarian carcinomas metastasize intra-peritoneally through implantation into the collagen-rich submesothelium, providing a mechanism for anchoring of secondary lesions to enable proliferation at multiple sites in the peritoneal cavity. We have previously demonstrated preferential adhesion of primary and established ovarian cancer cells to interstitial collagen relative to other matrix proteins including fibronectin, laminin, type IV collagen, and vitronectin (16.Moser T.L. Pizzo S.V. Bafetti L.M. Fishman D.A. Stack M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25.Fishman D.A. Kearns A. Chilukuri K. Bafetti L.M. O'Toole E.A. Georgacopoulos J. Ravosa M.J. Stack M.S. Invasion Metastasis. 1998; 18: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Modeling matrix-induced integrin aggregation using microbead-immobilized β1 integrin antibodies demonstrated that integrin clustering enhanced MT1-MMP expression and this stimulation of MT1-MMP collagenolytic activity was a rate-limiting step for invasion of three-dimensional collagen gels (14.Ellerbroek S.M. Wu Y.I. Overall C.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24833-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To evaluate further the molecular mechanisms that regulate MT1-MMP expression, a model of intraperitoneal metastasis comprised of tumor cells on three-dimensional collagen gels was utilized. Cells cultured on three-dimensional collagen type I gels adopt a distinct elongated morphology relative to cells cultured on thin layer (two-dimensional) collagen (Fig. 2A). These morphological changes are abrogated by pretreatment with β1 integrin function blocking antibodies (Fig. 2A, right panel), supporting the role of β1 integrins in ovarian cancer cell interaction with three-dimensional collagen gels. Cells generate internal tension via cytoskeletal modulations, balanced in part by adhesion to the ECM, and ample evidence suggests that integrin-mediated ECM adhesion is inherently a mechanosensory process (26.Cukierman E. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 27.Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that it is the ability of the ECM to resist tension and promote cell distortion that controls cellular behavior (29.Ingber D.E. Differentiation. 2002; 70: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, ovarian cancer cells were cultured in a three-dimensional peptide hydrogel (PuraMatrix Peptide Hydrogel, BD Biosciences) to modify cell shape in the absence of collagen-induced integrin clustering. Control experiments included three-dimensional collagen gels and thin layer type I collagen. Induction of MT1-MMP activity was evaluated by monitoring MT1-MMP-catalyzed activation of pro-MMP2 via gelatin zymography (13.Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Ellerbroek S.M. Wu Y.I. Overall C.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24833-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (13.Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Ellerbroek S.M. Wu Y.I. Overall C.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24833-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), thin layer collagen culture did not induce MT1-MMP activity and corresponding changes in pro-MMP2 activation (Fig. 2B). Similarly, altering cell shape by three-dimensional culture in PuraMatrix Peptide Hydrogel in the absence of collagen contact was not sufficient to induce MT1-MMP activity (Fig. 2C). In contrast, cells cultured in three-dimensional type I collagen gels exhibited a time-dependent increase in MT1-MMP activity (Fig. 2, D and E). This is supported by Western blot analysis of MT1-MMP protein levels, showing a similar time-dependent increase in MT1-MMP protein (Fig. 2, F and G). Levels of pro-MMP2 were not reproducibly altered by any of the above culture conditions. MT1-MMP Induction in Three-dimensional Collagen I Is Transcriptionally Regulated by EGR1−MT1-MMP is subject to considerable post-translational control via protein trafficking, zymogen activation, and autolysis; however, mechanisms of transcriptional regulation have not been extensively evaluated. We previously reported that collagen-induced MT1-MMP activity was blocked, in part, by actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis (14.Ellerbroek S.M. Wu Y.I. Overall C.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24833-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The promoter region of MT1-MMP has many putative transcription factor binding sites (30.Folgueras A.R. Pendas A.M. Sanchez L.M. Lopez-Otin C. Int. J. Dev.

https://openalex.org/W1989592079,"Type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC II) proliferate and transdifferentiate into type I alveolar epithelial cells (AEC I) when the normal AEC I population is damaged in the lung alveoli. We hypothesized that signaling by transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1), through its downstream Smad proteins, is involved in keeping AEC II quiescent in normal cells and its altered signaling may be involved in the trans-differentiation of AEC II to AEC I. In the normal lung, TGF β1 and Smad4 were highly expressed in AEC II. Using an in vitro cell culture model, we demonstrated that the trans-differentiation of AEC II into AEC I-like cells began with a proliferative phase, followed by a differentiation phase. The expression of TGF β1, Smad2, and Samd3 and their phosphorylated protein forms, and cell cycle inhibitors, p15Ink4b and p21Cip1, was lower during the proliferative phase but higher during the differentiation phase. Furthermore, cyclin-dependent kinases 2, 4, and 6 showed an opposite trend of expression. TGF β1 secretion into the media increased during the differentiation phase, indicating an autocrine regulation. The addition of TGF β1 neutralizing antibody after the proliferative phase and silencing of Smad4 by RNA interference inhibited the trans-differentiation process. In summary, our results suggest that the trans-differentiation of AEC II to AEC I is modulated by signaling through the Smad-dependent TGF β1 pathway by altering the expression of proteins that control the G1 to S phase entry in the cell cycle. Type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC II) proliferate and transdifferentiate into type I alveolar epithelial cells (AEC I) when the normal AEC I population is damaged in the lung alveoli. We hypothesized that signaling by transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1), through its downstream Smad proteins, is involved in keeping AEC II quiescent in normal cells and its altered signaling may be involved in the trans-differentiation of AEC II to AEC I. In the normal lung, TGF β1 and Smad4 were highly expressed in AEC II. Using an in vitro cell culture model, we demonstrated that the trans-differentiation of AEC II into AEC I-like cells began with a proliferative phase, followed by a differentiation phase. The expression of TGF β1, Smad2, and Samd3 and their phosphorylated protein forms, and cell cycle inhibitors, p15Ink4b and p21Cip1, was lower during the proliferative phase but higher during the differentiation phase. Furthermore, cyclin-dependent kinases 2, 4, and 6 showed an opposite trend of expression. TGF β1 secretion into the media increased during the differentiation phase, indicating an autocrine regulation. The addition of TGF β1 neutralizing antibody after the proliferative phase and silencing of Smad4 by RNA interference inhibited the trans-differentiation process. In summary, our results suggest that the trans-differentiation of AEC II to AEC I is modulated by signaling through the Smad-dependent TGF β1 pathway by altering the expression of proteins that control the G1 to S phase entry in the cell cycle.

II have a multifunctional role in the lung including secretory, synthetic, and progenitor capacities. AEC II serve as remodeling reservoirs for lung epithelium (1Warburton D. Bellusci S. Pediatr. Respir. Rev. 2004; 5: S283-S287Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). They are the progenitors for AEC I. By virtue of their squamous shape, AEC I cover the major surface area of alveoli and thus are the main epithelial component of the thin air-blood barrier. In contrast, AEC II are limited to the corners of the alveoli. The progenitor function of AEC II is activated when the lung epithelium encounters a variety of disease conditions including acute lung injury (2Fehrenbach H. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). AEC II cell proliferation and hyperplasia, followed by trans-differentiation into AEC I is a hallmark of alveolar epithelial injury. This helps to restore the normal air-blood barrier. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the trans-differentiation process are not clear. Questions regarding the causes of AEC II proliferation and trans-differentiation into AEC I during lung injury and prevention of this in normal alveoli largely remain unanswered.The transforming growth factor β (TGF β) superfamily consists of cytokines that are implicated in the regulation of a variety of biological responses (3Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 4Li M.O. Wan Y.Y. Sanjabi S. Robertson A.K. Flavell R.A. Annu. Rev.

Its members include isoforms of TGF β, bone morphogenetic proteins, Mullerian inhibiting substance, inhibins, and activins. A member of this family, TGF β1, regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in many cell and tissue systems. This cytokine is secreted by various cell types and acts both in autocrine and paracrine manners. The binding of TGF β1 to its specific type II receptor (TβRII) induces the formation of a heterotetrameric complex with the type I receptor (TβRI). This complex phosphorylates the TβRI. The activated TβRI in turn phosphorylates the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3. The phosphorylated R-Smads disassociate with the Smad anchor for receptor activation (7Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) and assemble with the common partner Smad (Co-Smad) named Smad4. The Smad heteromeric complex translocates into the nucleus, binds to DNA directly or indirectly through specific DNA-binding proteins, and regulates the transcription of target genes (8Massague J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 9Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Also there are inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), Smad6 and Smad7, which are antagonistic to the R-Smads and act by competitively binding to the activated TβRI (10Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 11Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Once the response is achieved, R-Smads and I-Smads are turned off mainly by ubiquitin-mediated degradation (12Izzi L. Attisano L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which TGF β inhibits cell proliferation varies in different epithelial cells (5ten Dijke P. Goumans M.J. Itoh F. Itoh S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Generally, the action is elicited by altering the levels of cell cycle proteins that are involved in the G1 to S phase entry before the restriction point in the cell cycle. TGF β increases the expression of two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p15 (p15Ink4b) (13Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) and p21 (p21Cip1) (14Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), which in turn inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 2, 4, and 6. TGF β can also inhibit the transcription of genes needed for the cell cycle progression. This includes c-Myc (15Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yaciuk P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow M.R.

Nature. 1997; 387: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Additionally, TGF β can initiate signaling through pathways other than those involving Smads, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and various members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (19Atfi A.

Pardo A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29: S93-S97PubMed Google Scholar, 23Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J.

Histopathology. 1994; 24: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whether it controls AEC II proliferation and trans-differentiation into AEC I has not been examined in detail. Studies on the effect of TGF β1 on AEC II so far have been limited to its anti-proliferative effects on culture systems that maintain the AEC II phenotype (26Zhang F. Nielsen L.D. Lucas J.J. Mason R.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here, we report the role of Smad-dependent TGF β1 pathway in the trans-differentiation of AEC II to AEC I using a model that mimics the differentiation process that takes place during lung injury. Through the addition of TGF β1 and its neutralizing antibody, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of Smad4 and by showing differential expression of the components of TGF β pathway and cell cycle proteins during the trans-differentiation process, we have demonstrated a possible mechanism of controlling this process in the alveolar epithelium.MATERIALS AND METHODSRat IgG, deoxyribonuclease 1, n-propyl gallate, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine, and recombinant human TGF β1 were obtained from Sigma.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12) in 1:1 ratio was from ATCC (Manassas, VA).Isolation and Culture of AEC II—AEC II were isolated from pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by an improved method as previously described (27Chen J. Chen Z. Narasaraju T. Jin N. Liu L. Lab. Investig. 2004; 84: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In brief, adult rat lungs were perfused, lavaged, and digested with elastase (3 units/ml). The cell mixture was filtered through 160- and 37-μm nylon mesh once and 15-μm nylon mesh twice, and plated on rat IgG-coated plates twice for 45 and 30 min to remove macrophages. The unattached cells were further incubated with anti-leukocyte common antigen (40 μg/ml) and rat IgG (70 μg/ml) antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. This was followed by incubation for 20 min with anti-rat and anti-mouse IgG-conjugated magnetic beads. A magnetic field was applied to remove the cells attached to the magnetic beads. The purity of AEC II was above 95% as determined by modified Papanicolaou staining and the viability was above 98%.AEC II were seeded onto 35-mm tissue culture-treated plastic dishes at a density of 1.3 × 106 cells/dish in minimum essential medium with 10% FBS and cultured for 1 to 7 days. The media were changed after the first 24 h and thereafter on alternate days. In this culture system, the trans-differentiation of AEC II to AEC I-like cells was evident from day 3 onwards and was nearly complete by day 5. For the sandwich ELISA experiment to quantitate TGF β1 secreted into media, modified serum-free medium (MDSF) was used. The MDSF contained a 1:1 ratio of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media, bovine serum albumin (1.5 mg/ml), 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 1000 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry—Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of perfused rat lungs were dewaxed using xylene and rehydrated using descending grades of ethanol. They were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Antigen retrieval was done by boiling the slides for 15 min in 20 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Cytospinned cells or cells cultured in 35-mm plastic dishes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The tissue sections or cells were permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 20 min and blocked for 1 h in 10% FBS. The slides were then incubated with mouse anti-Smad4 (1:50), mouse anti-TGF β1 (1:10), LB-180 (1:200), SP-C (1:100), or P2X7 (1:50) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Slides were washed and incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-rabbit/anti-goat and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse/anti-rabbit secondary antibodies or Cy-3-conjugated Affini-Pure anti-mouse IgG (1:250 dilution). Finally, slides were then washed and mounted on an anti-fade medium (5% n-propyl gallate and 80% glycerol in PBS) and viewed through a Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope or Nikon Eclipse TE 2000 U inverted fluorescence microscope.Real Time PCR—Total RNA (1 μg) was isolated using TRI Reagent and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and a mixture of random and oligo(dT) primers. Gene sequence information was obtained using nucleotide data bases. All primer sequences (Table 1) were designed using primer express 2.0 software and confirmed for specificity using the non-redundant basic local alignment search. The reverse transcribed cDNA was further diluted 5 times and quantitative real time PCR was done using an ABI prism 7700 system (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The reactions were carried out on 96-well plates. 18 S rRNA was amplified on the same plates and used to normalize the data. The reaction volume was 10 μl containing 5 μl of the SYBR master mix, 0.4 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 0.3 μl each of 5 μm forward and reverse primers, 2 μl of RNase-free water, and 2 μl of the cDNA samples. Each sample was prepared in duplicate and at least 3 different sets of cell preparations were used. The thermal cycling conditions used were: 95 °C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The data acquisition temperature varied from 76 to 78 °C depending on the melting temperature of the individual PCR products. Dissociation curve analysis was performed for each gene to ensure the specificity of PCR products. The relative abundance of each gene was calculated by subtracting the CT value of each sample of an individual gene from the corresponding value for the 18 S gene (δCT). Freshly isolated AEC II (day 0) were used as the reference point. δδCT were obtained by subtracting CT of the reference point. These values were raised to the power of 2 (2δδCT) to give expression levels relative to day 0 expression.TABLE 1Primers used for real time PCRGenBank IDGene namePrimersBC076380TGF β1ForwardAATTCCTGGCGTTACCTTGGTReverseTGTATTCCGTCTCCTTGGTTCAAB010147Smad2ForwardATGGTCGTCTTCAGGTGTCTCAReverseTGAAAGCGTATTCGCAGTTCTCBC064437Smad3ForwardTTCAACGGAACTTGGGAATGAGReverseTTGCTGACCACCCTGCTCTTAF056002Smad4ForwardGCAGTTGGTAACAGGTAGTTTGGATReverseTCCCACGCTTCTACTTCAACGTNM_008542Smad6ForwardAGGCCACCAACTCCCTCATCReverseGTGTCCGGTGCTCCCAGTATBC086995p15ForwardAAGGCAAAGCCAATCAGAAATAAReverseATAGAGGGTCCCAGAACTTCATACANM_080782p21ForwardGCAAAGTATGCCGTCGTCTGTReverseCGTCTCAGTGGCGAAGTCAAM1118818SForwardTCCCAGTAAGTGCGGGTCATAReverseCGAGGGCCTCACTAAACCATC Open table in a new tab Western Blot—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The protein concentration was determined by the Dc protein assay kit.20 μg of protein was separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 17 mA for 60 min. The membrane was stained with Ponceau S to ensure proper transfer and blocked overnight with 5% dry skim milk power in 100 mm Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The membranes were incubated with anti-Smad2, anti-Smad3, anti-Smad4, anti-TGF β1, anti-pSmad2, anti-pSmad3, anti-p15, anti-p21, anti-CDK2, anti-CDK4, or anti-CDK6 antibodies at 1:100 dilutions overnight at 4 °C. After being washed in TBS-T 3 times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, -goat, or -rabbit IgGs (1:2000) for 1 h. The blots were washed again. The individual target proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system.5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Labeling—To determine cell proliferation in the in vitro AEC trans-differentiation model, BrdUrd was added at a concentration of 10 μm into the culture media and incubated for 12–14 h. After being washed with PBS (pH 7.4), the cells were fixed with 75% methanol containing 5 mm glycine at -20 °C for 20 min. The cells were washed again and treated with 2 m HCl to denature the DNA strands followed by neutralization using borate buffer (pH 9.4). The cells then were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked in 10% FBS in PBS-T for 2 h. BrdUrd was detected using monoclonal anti-BrdUrd Antibody (1:100 dilution) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:250 dilution).Sandwich ELISA—To measure the TGF β1 secretion into the media, AEC II were cultured in MDSF on plastic dishes for 0–5 days. The use of MDSF avoids potential contamination from endogenous TGF β1 in FBS. The amount of TGF β1 secreted into the medium was assayed using an ELISA kit. Briefly, monoclonal anti-TGF β1 antibody was precoated on a microplate. The latent TGF β1 in the media was activated by the addition of 1 n HCl, followed by neutralization using 1.2 n NaOH, 0.5 m HEPES. Serially diluted standards, controls, and activated samples were incubated on the microplate for 2 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker. This was followed by thorough washing and the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibody specific to TGF β1. After 2 h of incubation and subsequent washing, the substrate solution was added to each well. The plate was protected from light and incubated for 30 min at room temperature so that color developed in proportion to the amount of TGF β1 bound in the initial step. The reaction was terminated by adding the stop solution. The optical density was measured within 30 min using a microplate reader set to 450 nm with a wavelength correction set at 540 nm.Construction of Adenovirus Vectors—A new pK4-short hairpin RNA vector, developed in our laboratory, was used to silence Smad4. The single vector expresses four short hairpin RNA driven by four different promoters after transfecting into cells. The details for the construction of the new vector will be published elsewhere. The four small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences for Smad4 were: 5′-GGTGGAGAGAGTGAGACATT-3′ (85–104), 5′-GCGTCTGTGTGAACCCATATC-3′ (374–394), 5′-GGAATTGATCTCTCTGGATTA-3′ (418–428), and 5′-GGAGTGCAGTTGGAGTGTAAA-3′ (1156–1176). A vector containing four non-relevant siRNA sequences was used as a control. The sequences were 5′-ACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAATT-3′,5′-GATCGTGATAACCTAGCTGTC-3′,5′-ATGCTTGACGCAGCTAACGCA-3′, and 5′-GGCTAACTACGCACAGTAAGT-3′. The expression cassettes were ligated into pENTR vectors (Invitrogen) using the Invitrogen Gateway® technology. They were switched to the adenoviral vectors by LR recombinations. The viral vectors were transfected into 293A cells to produce the first generation of virus. After amplification, the second generation of viruses was used to infect target cells. The virus with Smad4 silencing sequence was named AdSmad4Si and the control with the four non-relevant sequences AdCon.Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by using one-way analysis of variance using GraphPad Prism software, followed by Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test. The significance was assigned at p < 0.05.RESULTSTGF β1 and Smad4 Were Highly Expressed in AEC II—To identify cellular localization of TGF β1 and Smad4, double immunolabeling was performed on perfused normal rat lung tissue sections by using monoclonal antibodies for TGF β1 or Smad4, and goat polyclonal antibody for SP-C (an AEC II marker). The results revealed a strong co-localization of both proteins with SP-C in AEC II (Fig. 1). The negative controls with only secondary antibodies did not show any signals. TGF β1 and Smad4 were also present to a lesser extent in AEC I. A high expression of TGF β1 was also seen in alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells (data not shown).AEC II Proliferated and Then Differentiated to AEC I-like Cells in the in Vitro Trans-differentiation Model—It is well known that AEC II gradually trans-differentiate into AEC I-like cells when cultured on plastic dishes (28Paine R. Simon R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L484-L486PubMed Google Scholar, 29Williams M.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 669-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, the kinetics of cell proliferation and differentiation during this process has not been examined. The trans-differentiation of AEC II to AEC I-like cells was confirmed by immunostaining with AEC II and AEC I markers, LB-180 for AEC II, and P2X7 for AEC I (30Zen K. Notarfrancesco K. Oorschot V. Slot J.W. Fisher A.B. Shuman H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L172-L183PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chen Z. Jin N. Narasaraju T. Chen J. McFarland L.R. Scott M. Liu L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 774-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On day 1, LB-180 expression was strong with no expression of P2X7, but it disappeared on days 3 and 5 along with the concurrent appearance of P2X7 (Fig. 2A). This indicates that the trans-differentiation occurs between days 3 and 5. Some day 3 cells showed the expression of both AEC II and AEC I markers, demonstrating the possibility of an intermediate cell type. The BrdUrd staining experiments showed that AEC II proliferation increased from day 1 to day 2 and decreased thereafter (Fig. 2B). This suggests that there is a proliferation phase (day 0 to day 2) that precedes the differentiation phase (day 3 to day 5) in the in vitro model.FIGURE 2Expression of AEC I and AEC II markers and BrdUrd labeling during the trans-differentiation. Freshly isolated AEC II were seeded on plastic dishes in minimum essential medium containing 10% FBS and cultured for 1–5 days. A, double labeling of the cultured cells on days 1, 3, and 5 was done using anti-LB-180 (panels b, e, and h) and anti-P2X7 antibodies (panels c, f, and i). The protein expression was visualized using corresponding Alexa 488- or 568-conjugated secondary antibodies. B, BrdUrd labeling: BrdUrd was added at a concentration of 10 μm to the culture media 12–14 h before fixing cells. Immunostaining was done on the cells cultured for 1–5 days using anti-BrdUrd antibody and Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Scale bar, 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)mRNA and Protein Expression Levels of TGF β1 and Smads Were Altered during the Trans-differentiation from AEC II to AEC I-like Cells—Because there is a proliferation phase immediately following AEC II isolation and culture, we hypothesized that the expression of TGF β1 and its downstream components, R-Smads, would be lower during the proliferation phase, but increase during the differentiation phase so as to facilitate the cell cycle exit. We therefore examined the mRNA and protein expression levels of TGF β1 and Smads in the in vitro transdifferentiation model by real time PCR and Western blotting. The TGF β1 mRNA expression level was low during proliferation, but increased significantly during the later stage of differentiation (Fig. 3A). The same trend was observed at the protein level (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3The expression of TGF β1 and its downstream components during trans-differentiation. AEC II were seeded on plastic dishes and cultured for 1–5 days. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed to cDNA. Real time PCR was done to determine the mRNA abundance of TGF β1(A), Smad2 (D), Smad3 (E), and Smad6 (G). Data were normalized to 18 S RNA and expressed as a ratio to the day 0 value. The error bars represent S.E. Absence of an error bar denotes very low standard error value. *, p < 0.05 versus day 0; **, p < 0.01 versus day 0, n = 3 independent cell preparations, each assay was performed in duplicate. The protein levels of TGF β1(B), Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and phosphorylated Smad2 and Samd3 (pSmad2 and pSmad3) (F) were detected by Western blot using corresponding antibodies. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the loading control. The TGF β1 secretion into the media during a 24-h period was determined by sandwich ELISA (C). AEC II were cultured for 1–5 days. The medium was changed every day. At the indicated time points the media was collected and TGF β1 content was measured. The error bars represent S.E. **, p < 0.05 versus day 2; ***, p < 0.01 versus day 2, n = three independent cell preparations, each assay performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TGF β1 activates its signal transduction pathway by binding to the specific TβRII-TβRI receptor complex on the extracellular side of the cell membrane. We therefore investigated whether TGF β1 was secreted from the cultured cells as they trans-differentiated. AEC II were cultured in MDSF media, the media collected on days 2, 3, 4, and 5, and the TGF β1 concentration determined by sandwich ELISA. TGF β1 secretion into the surrounding media increased significantly during trans-differentiation and corresponded with the increase in TGF β1 production within the cells (Fig. 3C). The same experiment, when repeated in minimum essential medium + 10% FBS, yielded similar results (data not shown).The mRNA expression of Smad2 and Smad3 remained lower during the proliferation phase and increased on day 3 as differentiation became evident (Fig. 3, D and E). This almost corresponded to their protein levels (Fig. 3F). Because the presence of their phosphorylated form would be a better indicator of the activation of the Smad-dependent TGF β pathway, we further determined the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 using antibodies that only recognized the phosphorylated form of Smad2 or Smad3"
https://openalex.org/W2094132890,"Rapid cell proliferation is a hallmark of transit amplifying cells, but the mechanisms of this localized proliferation are not well understood. The Krüppel-like factor family member Klf5 (IKLF; BTEB2) promotes cell proliferation and is highly expressed in squamous epithelia, in regions of active proliferation. Here, using mouse primary esophageal keratinocytes as a model, we identify a critical role for Klf5 in regulating squamous epithelial proliferation via the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which, like Klf5, is localized to basal cells in squamous epithelia. We show that Klf5 increases proliferation, transcriptionally up-regulates EGFR, and activates MEK/ERK signaling, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of MEK and ERK. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that Klf5 binds directly to the 5' regulatory region of EGFR. In addition, we show that regulation of proliferation by Klf5 is dependent on EGFR and MEK/ERK signaling, as the proliferative response to Klf5 is blocked by pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR or MEK. Inhibition of EGFR or MEK also decreases Klf5 expression. Thus, Klf5 regulates MEK/ERK signaling via EGFR and is also downstream of MAPK signaling, providing a novel mechanism for signal amplification or suppression and control of proliferation in basal cells."

We cloned YdgR and overexpressed the His-tagged fusion protein in E. coli BL21 cells. Bacterial growth inhibition in the presence of the toxic phosphonopeptide alafosfalin established YgdR functionality. Transport was abolished in the presence of the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone, suggesting a proton-coupled transport mechanism. YdgR transports selectively only di- and tripeptides and structurally related peptidomimetics (such as aminocephalosporins) with a substrate recognition pattern almost identical to the mammalian peptide transporter PEPT1. The YdgR protein was purified to homogeneity from E. coli membranes. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy of detergent-solubilized YdgR suggest that it exists in monomeric form. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a crown-like structure with a diameter of ∼8 nm and a central density.

Peptide transporters are integral membrane proteins that mediate the cellular uptake of di- and tripeptides and a variety of peptidomimetics (for review, see Refs. 1Brandsch M. Knutter I.

Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). They are found in bacteria, yeast, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. In vertebrates, the two peptide transporter proteins, PEPT1 (SLC15A1) and PEPT2 (SLC15A2), are expressed predominantly in brush border membranes of small intestine (PEPT1), kidney (PEPT1 and PEPT2), and lung (PEPT2). In these transport proteins substrate flux is coupled to proton movement down an electrochemical proton gradient with the membrane potential as the main driving force. PEPT1 and PEPT2 accept essentially all 400 possible dipeptides and 8000 possible tripeptides composed of l-α amino acids as substrates. Moreover, they also transport a large spectrum of therapeutic drugs like β-lactam antibiotics, selected angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and peptidase inhibitors and thereby determine their bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. Certain drugs with an intrinsic low oral bioavailability like l-DOPA and acyclovir have by coupling to an amino acid (l-DOPA-Phe and Val-acyclovir) turned into substrates of peptide transporters with markedly improved availability (5Ganapathy M.E.

Peptide transporters are, therefore, considered as important and potent drug delivery systems. Although functionally characterized in detail, very little is known about the structure of peptide transporter proteins. Twelve transmembrane domains are predicted (7Covitz K.M. Amidon G.L. Sadee W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15214-15221Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and amino acid residues critical for transport activity have been identified in particular in transmembrane domains 2, 3, 4, and 10 by functional analysis of mutants (8Bolger M.B.

Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The first is a region that begins at the end of the second putative transmembrane domain, including the following first cytoplasmic loop as well as the third transmembrane domain. The second motif corresponds to the core region of the fifth transmembrane region. Besides the mammalian PEPT1 and PEPT2 proteins, the PTR2 family includes the yeast peptide transporter PTR2, DtpT from Lactococcus lactis, and numerous “orphan” transporters for which function is not known yet. Most orphan transporters are found in prokaryotic organism, e.g. the four members ybgH, ydgR, yhiP, and yjdL in Escherichia coli. Although these gene sequences belong to the same family, the function of the corresponding proteins may be quite different.Here we describe the cloning of the ydgR gene, which was identified by sequence analysis as the E. coli homologue of tppB from Salmonella typhimurium (14Goh E.B. Siino D.F. Igo M.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4019-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Based on growth experiments with mutant bacterial strains, tppB was already identified in 1984 as a tripeptide permease (15Higgins C.F. Gibson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Gibson M.M. Price M. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 122-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither TppB nor YdgR has been characterized biochemically nor with respect to mode of function. We overexpressed YdgR as a fusion protein with the IPTG 3The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; BN, blue native; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; TM, transmembrane regions; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; rbs, ribosomal binding site; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; AMCA, Nϵ-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Mob, apparent molecular mass. 3The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; BN, blue native; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; TM, transmembrane regions; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; rbs, ribosomal binding site; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; AMCA, Nϵ-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Mob, apparent molecular mass.-inducible pET-expression system. YdgR encodes a proton-dependent peptide transporter with a broad substrate specificity ranging from di- and tripeptides to a variety of related peptidomimetics-like β-lactam antibiotics. The YdgR protein was purified to homogeneity and functionally reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Analysis by blue native (BN)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of detergent-solubilized YdgR suggests a monomeric state of the protein. In addition, TEM provided the first structural data on a proton-dependent di- and tripeptide transporter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Expression of the YdgR Transport Protein in E. coli—Genomic DNA from E. coli strain O157:H7 was prepared with the Qiagen DNeasy kit. The ydgR gene was cloned from genomic DNA by PCR with primers (5′-3′) AAAAAGCTTATGTCCACTGCAAACCAAAAAC and AAACTCGAGCGCTACGGCTGCTTTCGC. PCR products were digested with HindIII/XhoI and ligated into pET-21 vector (T7 promotor, C-terminal hexahistidine tag, Novagen). A ribosomal binding site (rbs) (AAGGAG) was added 7 bases 5′ of the coding region to improve translation of the protein. The DNA construct (pET-21-rbs-YdgR-His) was verified by sequencing. Expression experiments were carried out with freshly transformed E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Cultures were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to A600 of ∼1, and protein expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm IPTG (final concentration). After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C cells were harvested for biochemical or functional analysis. A second expression vector (pET-21b-rbs-T7-YdgR-His) was constructed by cutting pET-21-rbs-YdgR-His with HindIII/XhoI and ligating the insert into pET-21b vector.Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, cells from 1 ml of culture were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture 1:500 (Sigma)) with lysozyme (1 μg) added. After 1 h of incubation on ice, bacterial DNA was degraded for 30 min by 1 unit of benzonase in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min and solubilized in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM). After 15 min on ice unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 45 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Filters were blocked by incubation for 1 h with 1% (w/v) milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, and 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) followed by incubation for 60 min with anti-His antibody (1:2000 dilution, Novagen) in TBS-T (TBS, 0.05% Tween 20). Filters were washed twice in the same buffer and then incubated for 30 min with secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution, goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase; Santa Cruz). Filters were first washed twice in TBS-T and twice with TBS (10 min/wash). Labeled proteins were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Transport Assays—Transport assays were performed in vivo with cells 3 h after induction with IPTG (see above) with the fluorescent dipeptide β-Ala-Lys-Nϵ-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid (β-Ala-Lys-AMCA) (custom-synthesis by Biotrend, Cologne, Germany). β-Ala-Lys-AMCA was previously established as a reporter substrate for peptide transport (17Dieck S.T. Heuer H. Ehrchen J. Otto C. Bauer K. Glia. 1999; 25: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Otto C. tom Dieck S. Bauer K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: 210-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 109 cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1.5 ml of modified Krebs-Buffer (25 mm Hepes/Tris 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose). The assay volume of 100 μl was made up with 40 μl of bacteria cells (1.3 × 108 cells), 10 μl of a 500 μm β-Ala-Lys-AMCA stock solution (final concentration 50 μm), and 50 μl of Krebs buffer (control) or a competitor solution. Uptake was performed for 15 min at 37 °C and stopped by washing the cells twice with ice-cold Krebs buffer by centrifugation. Uptake of β-Ala-Lys-AMCA was quantified by fluorescence (excitation at 340 nm and emission at 460 nm, Thermo Varioscan).Purification of the YdgR Protein—Cell pellets from 600 ml of culture were resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and a Sigma protease inhibitor mixture (1:500) and broken by sonification (10 cycles of 30 s). After a short low speed centrifugation to separate unbroken cells (4500 × g, 8 min) and a short high speed centrifugation to pellet the outer membrane (120,000 × g, 5 min) the inner membranes from the supernatant were collected by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 1.5 h (all at 4 °C). The pellets were resuspended in buffer (20% glycerol, 10 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm Tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. YdgR membranes were solubilized (60 min, 4 °C) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 1% DDM, 10% glycerol, 0.01% NaN3 at protein concentrations of 1–3 mg/ml. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 45 min), the supernatant was diluted 2-fold with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.04% DDM, 2 mm histidine, 10% glycerol, 0.01% NaN3 (wash buffer) and bound to Ni-NTA Superflow beads (2 h, 4 °C; Qiagen). The beads were then loaded onto a spin column (Promega), washed with wash buffer, and eluted with buffer containing 200 mm histidine.Reconstitution into Proteoliposomes—For functional reconstitution YdgR-containing membranes were solubilized in buffer (10 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 1% DDM, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm Tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine) at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation (40,000 × g, 30 min) the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (HisTrap FF, Amersham Biosciences) and washed with running buffer (10 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 0.06% DDM, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm Tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine). Protein was eluted with a gradient from 30 to 250 mm imidazole in running buffer. YdgR elutes in a sharp peak at about 150 mm imidazole. For reconstitution, E. coli lipids (500 μl, Avanti Polar Lipids) at a concentration of 20 mg/ml in CHCl3 were dried under vacuum and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (25 mm Hepes/Na, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Liposomes were destabilized with 10 mg of DDM and sonicated for 30 min. 400 μl of purified YdgR protein as eluted from the Ni-NTA column was added at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. After 10 min incubation on ice, detergent was removed by adding 500 mg of Bio-Beads SM-2 Adsorbants (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C. The detergent removal step was repeated with 200 mg of Bio-Beads for 4 h at 4°C.Electrical Measurements of Reconstituted YdgR with the SURFE2Rone Setup—Electrical measurements of YdgR transport were based on the solid-supported membrane technology, which allows detection of capacitively coupled currents (19Meyer-Lipp K. Ganea C. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Fendler K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12606-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). YdgR-loaded sensors were prepared as described by Zuber et al. (20Zuber D. Krause R. Venturi M. Padan E. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1709: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using YdgR proteoliposomes (see above) and SURFE2Rone gold electrodes from IonGate BioSciences. The measurements were performed with the commercially available surface electrogenic event reader SURFE2Rone setup (IonGate Biosciences). The measurements of transporter-related currents on the chip are based on the shift of electrical charges as the transporters go through the transport cycle, and the shift can originate from the movement of charged substrates or of protein moieties carrying (partial) charges. YdgR-mediated transport was activated via rapid solution exchange from a so-called non-activating (off) (40 mm KCl, 50 mm Hepes, 50 mm MES, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.7) to an “activating” (on) solution (containing 30 mm glycine and 20 mm glycyl-glycine). In activating solutions with lower glycylglycine concentrations, the total osmolarity of the organic solutes glycine and glycyl-glycine together was adjusted to 50 mm. After a rapid fluid exchange to a peptide-containing solution, the charging of the proteoliposomes on the sensor driven by the H+/peptide symport is measured. Previous comparisons of the characteristics of rheogenic transporters employing this new cell-free electrophysiological technique with findings from patch clamp studies revealed a very good correlation in all features (21Geibel S. Flores-Herr N. Licher T. Vollert H. J. Biomol. Screen. 2006; 11: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis—Linear 5–12% gradient gels for BN-PAGE were prepared and run as previously described by Schägger and von Jagow (22Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) were used as standard proteins.Transmission Electron Microscopy—DDM-solubilized YdgR protein as eluted from the Ni-NTA column was adsorbed for 10 s to parlodion carbon-coated copper grids rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. Grids were washed with four drops of double-distilled water and stained with 2 drops of 0.75% uranyl formate. Images were recorded on Eastman Kodak Co. SO-163 sheet films with a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope operated at 100 kV.Data Analysis—All experiments were performed for the indicated number of observations (n). IC50 values were obtained by nonlinear regression, and the value is given ± S.E. The Ki were calculated from the IC50 using the equation from Cheng and Prusoff (23Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12189) Google Scholar).RESULTSCloning and Functional Expression of the YdgR Protein from E. coli—The ydgR gene from E. coli was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using gene-specific primers. The gene was cloned into the pET-21 vector fused with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (pET-21-ydgR-His). The expression of the YdgR protein in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS was tested by Western blot analysis with an antibody derived against the hexahistidine tag (Fig. 1A). Proteins from non-induced (control, Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3) and induced E. coli (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–6) were fractionated in (i) soluble proteins, (ii) membrane proteins solubilized in 1% DDM, and (iii) insoluble proteins and separated by SDS-PAGE. The anti-His antibody detected a protein in the membrane protein fraction of induced cells (lane 5) with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa. Small amounts of the protein were detected in the insoluble protein fraction (lane 6), indicating some protein not properly solubilized or from inclusion bodies. Because no band was detected from extracts obtained from control cells, the 39-kDa protein band represents the YdgR protein. The discrepancy between the expected molecular mass (55 kDa) as deduced from the amino acid sequence of YdgR and the apparent molecular mass as determined by SDS-PAGE might be due to the known abnormal migration behavior of several membrane proteins. This often causes an underestimation of the true molecular mass. To test this hypothesis and to verify that the protein is not degraded, we constructed a second expression vector with an N-terminal T7 tag (11 N-terminal amino acids of the T7 gene 10 plus 10 amino acids spacer) in addition to the C-terminal hexahistidine tag (pET-21b-rbs-T7-ydgR-His). The apparent molecular mass of the two proteins YdgR-His and T7-YdgR-His were compared by Western blot analysis with the anti-His antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) and the anti-T7 antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). As expected, both proteins were detected by the anti-His antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2), whereas the anti-T7 antibody detected only T7-YdgR-His (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Because both antibodies detected the same protein (T7-YdgR-His) and the apparent molecular mass of this protein is only slightly increased compared with YdgR-His, we conclude that the overall deduced low apparent molecular mass is due to an abnormal migration behavior but not proteolysis. All further experiments were performed with the pET-21-rbs-ydgR-His construct.To assess the functionality of the expressed YdgR protein, simple growth experiments were conducted (Fig. 1C). In S. typhimurium the toxic phosphonopeptide alafosfalin is taken up by the tripeptide permease TppB, and mutants in TppB show resistance to alafosfalin (16Gibson M.M. Price M. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 122-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, grew E. coli carrying the vector (pET-21-rbs-YdgR-His) in the presence of a non-toxic concentration of alafosfalin (200 μg/ml, Fig. 1C, curve b). As compared with E. coli grown in the absence of alafosfalin (curve a), growth rates were only slightly reduced. When expression of YdgR was induced at an A600 of about 1 (curve c), the peptide then caused cell death. This indicates that YdgR was functionally expressed in the membrane, loading the cells with the toxic agent. Transport function of YdgR was also determined using the fluorescent dipeptide reporter β-Ala-Lys-AMCA as a substrate (Fig. 2A). Cells expressing YdgR showed only minor autofluorescence in the absence of β-Ala-Lys-AMCA (bar 4), but fluorescence increased significantly after incubation of cells with 50 μm β-Ala-Lys-AMCA (bar 5). Fluorescence was abolished by the addition of an excess amount of the non-labeled dipeptide Gly-Gln (bar 6). When β-Ala-Lys-AMCA uptake was determined as a function of its concentration, transport was found to be saturable with an apparent Kt of 0.44 ± 0.05 mm (Fig. 2C). Control experiments with pET-21 vector transformed E. coli showed no uptake of β-Ala-Lys-AMCA (bars 1–3), indicating that no other endogenous transport system in E. coli mediates β-Ala-Lys-AMCA uptake. For further characterization of transport, we studied the requirements of Na+ and H+ as cotransport ions (Fig. 2B). The replacement of Na+ by choline had no significant effect on the uptake of β-Ala-Lys-AMCA, but the presence of CCCP, a proton ionophore, caused complete inhibition of transport. Thus, peptide uptake via YdgR depends on the proton-motive force and is most likely as described for the other family members mediated by a coupled proton-substrate cotransport.FIGURE 2Transport function of the YdgR protein with the fluorescent di peptide β-Ala-Lys-AMCA serving as a substrate. A, control cells transformed with pET-21 vector (bars 1–3) and cells expressing the YdgR protein (bars 4–6) were incubated in Krebs buffer alone (bars 1 and 4) or Krebs buffer containing 50 μm β-Ala-Lys-AMCA (bars 2 and 5) or 50 μm β-Ala-Lys-AMCA together with 10 mm competitor Gly-Gln (bars 3 and 6) (n = 6). B, the Na+ and H+ dependence of β-Ala-Lys-AMCA uptake by YdgR was assessed by incubating E. coli expressing YdgR with 50 μm β-Ala-Lys-AMCA in the presence (left-most) and in the absence (center bar) of Na+ (by replacing sodium with choline) or by exposing cells (n = 4) to 10 μm concentrations of selective proton-ionophore CCCP (right-most bar).

D, inhibition of β-Ala-Lys-AMCA uptake by the amino acid l-Ala and the corresponding di-, tri-, and tetrapeptides of l-Ala. Uptake of β-Ala-Lys-AMCA (50 μm, final concentration) was determined in the presence of 10 mm l-Ala (bar 1), l-Ala-l-Ala (bar 2), l-Ala-l-Ala-l-Ala (bar 3), and l-Ala-l-Ala-l-Ala-l-Ala (bar 4)(n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Studies on Substrate Specificity of YdgR—To determine the transporter's substrate specificity, E. coli cells overexpressing YdgR were incubated with 50 μm β-Ala-Lys-AMCA in the presence of an excess (200-fold) of l-alanine either as free amino acid or as a di-, tri-, and tetrapeptide (Fig. 2D). Alanine and tetra-alanine did not inhibit uptake of β-Ala-Lys-AMCA, whereas di- and tri-alanine completely inhibited β-Ala-Lys-AMCA uptake. Inhibition of transport by increasing concentrations of di- and tri-alanine allowed apparent affinities (IC50 values) of 0.52 ± 0.03 and 0.24 ± 0.01 mm to be determined (Fig. 3A). Stereospecificity of YdgR-mediated flux was assessed by determining IC50 values of dipeptides carrying l- or d-alanine residues (Fig. 3B). Substitution of the N-terminal l-Ala for the d isomer did not alter affinity significantly, but when the C-terminal l-Ala was replaced by a d isomer, affinity of the competitor was reduced about 8-fold (Fig. 3B). d-Ala-d-Ala did not show detectable affinity for interaction with YdgR (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Substrate specificity of the YdgR protein.

Uptake of β-Ala-Lys-AMCA (50 μm) was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations (0.05–10 mm) of either l-Ala-l-Ala (circles) with an IC50 of 0.52 ± 0.03 mm or l-Ala-l-Ala-l-Ala (triangles) with an IC50 of 0.24 ± 0.01 mm. B, stereoselectivity of transport was determined by inhibition of β-Ala-Lys-AMCA (50 μm) uptake by 0.1–10 mmd-Ala-l-Ala (triangles) with an IC50 of 0.48 ± 0.05 mm, 0.8–80 mml-Ala-d-Ala (circles) with an IC50 of 4.10 ± 0.33 mm, or 5–80 mmd-Ala-d-Ala (squares). C, interaction of peptidomimetics with YdgR was tested by uptake (n = 4; *, n = 2) of 50 μm β-Ala-Lys-AMCA in the absence (bar 1) and presence of 10 mm concentrations of the competitors Gly-Gln (bar 2), cefadroxil (bar 3), cefalexin (bar 4), cephradine (bar 5), cephamandole (bar 6), cefuroxime (bar 7), ampicillin (bar 8), amoxicillin (bar 9), captopril (bar 10), or enalapril (bar 11).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transport Characteristics of Differently Charged Dipeptide Substrates—To further characterize substrate specificity of YdgR, we determined IC50 values of various other compounds ranging from differently charged dipeptides consisting of l-amino acids to an ω-amino fatty acid and a known inhibitor of mammalian peptide transporters (see Table 1). Neutral dipeptides represented by Gly-Gln or cationic peptides such as Lys-Gly showed relatively high affinities with IC50 values of 0.51 ± 0.06 mm and 0.43 ± 0.02, respectively. Introducing the positively charged amino acid at the C-terminal position (Gly-Lys) resulted in a 7-fold reduction of affinity represented by an IC50 of 2.83 ± 0.27 mm as compared with 0.43 mm for Lys-Gly. This indicates an asymmetric substrate binding site in YdgR similar to that described for the mammalian peptide transporters (24Theis S. Hartrodt B. Kottra G. Neubert K. Daniel H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This observation is strengthened by experiments with the anionic dipeptide Asp-Gly. When Asp instead of Lys was placed in the first position affinity decreased by 10-fold (Asp-Gly, IC50 = 4.46 ± 0.45 mm), whereas when placed in the second position, affinity increased again when compared with a Lys residue (Gly-Asp, IC50 = 1.92 ± 0.13 mm). Modifying the peptide bond nitrogen by a CH3 group like in glycyl-sarcosine yielded moderate affinity (IC50 = 1.16 ± 0.09 mm). The highest affinity of all test compounds displayed the inhibitor of mammalian peptide transporters Lys-Z-nitro-Pro with an IC50 value of 0.033 ± 0.006 mm. Mammalian peptide transporters do not require a peptide bond for recognition of a substrate (25Doring F. Will J. Amasheh S. Clauss W. Ahlbrecht H. Daniel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23211-23218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To test whether this holds true also for the YdgR protein, we used 5-aminolevulinic acid as a substrate that carries only the two oppositely charged head groups separated by four carbon units and a backbone carbonyl. Its apparent affinity was 1.69 ± 0.14 mm and, therefore, higher than that of most charged dipeptides.TABLE 1Summary of IC50 values (mm) and Ki valuesIC50KiGly-Gln0.51 ± 0.06 (7)0.46 ± 0.05Lys-Gly0.43 ± 0.02 (4)0.39 ± 0.02Gly-Lys2.83 ± 0.27 (5)2.54 ± 0.24Asp-Gly4.46 ± 0.45 (6)4.00 ± 0.40Gly-Asp1.92 ± 0.13 (12)1.72 ± 0.12Lys-Ala0.77 ± 0.05 (4)0.69 ± 0.04Leu-Ala1.27 ± 0.10 (4)1.14 ± 0.09Ala-Ala0.52 ± 0.03 (6)0.47 ± 0.03Ala-d-Ala4.10 ± 0.33 (4)3.68 ± 0.30d-Ala-Ala0.48 ± 0.05 (4)0.43 ± 0.04Ala-Ala-Ala0.24 ± 0.01 (8)0.22 ± 0.01Gly-Sar1.16 ± 0.09 (10)1.04 ± 0.08Alafosfalin0.28 ± 0.03 (4)0.25 ± 0.03Lys-Z-Nitro-Pro0.033 ± 0.006 (4)0.03 ± 0.015-Aminolevulinic acid1.69 ± 0.14 (6)1.52 ± 0.13 Open table in a new tab Transport of Peptidomimetics— Beside di- and tripeptides, mammalian pep"
https://openalex.org/W2054818623,"The spindle checkpoint is a cell cycle surveillance mechanism that ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Bub1 is a protein serine-threonine kinase that plays multiple roles in chromosome segregation and the spindle checkpoint. In response to misaligned chromosomes, Bub1 directly inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) by phosphorylating its activator Cdc20. The protein level and the kinase activity of Bub1 are regulated during the cell cycle; they peak in mitosis and are low in G1/S phase. Here we show that Bub1 is degraded during mitotic exit and that degradation of Bub1 is mediated by APC/C in complex with its activator Cdh1 (APC/CCdh1). Overexpression of Cdh1 reduces the protein levels of ectopically expressed Bub1, whereas depletion of Cdh1 by RNA interference increases the level of the endogenous Bub1 protein. Bub1 is ubiquitinated by immunopurified APC/CCdh1 in vitro. We further identify two KEN-box motifs on Bub1 that are required for its degradation in vivo and ubiquitination in vitro. A Bub1 mutant protein with both KEN-boxes mutated is stable in cells but fails to elicit a cell cycle phenotype, indicating that degradation of Bub1 by APC/CCdh1 is not required for mitotic exit. Nevertheless, our study clearly demonstrates that Bub1, an APC/C inhibitor, is also an APC/C substrate. The antagonistic relationship between Bub1 and APC/C may help to prevent the premature accumulation of Bub1 during G1.

Nevertheless, our study clearly demonstrates that Bub1, an APC/C inhibitor, is also an APC/C substrate. The antagonistic relationship between Bub1 and APC/C may help to prevent the premature accumulation of Bub1 during G1. Ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent proteolysis is one of the key mechanisms that ensure the uni-directional progression of the cell cycle (1Hershko A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 2Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin molecule is activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and finally attached to a lysine residue in the substrate with the help of a ubiquitin ligase (E3). 2The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; RNAi, RNA interference; APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome; CHX, cycloheximide; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; Dox, doxycycline. These reactions can be repeated to allow the formation of ubiquitin chains on substrates. Polyubiquitinated substrates are then recognized by proteasome for destruction (3Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Chiba T. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 503-512PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency and specificity of substrate ubiquitination are usually determined by the E3s (3Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Chiba T. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 503-512PubMed Google Scholar). The anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) is a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase and is required for the proper segregation of sister chromatids and for the exit from mitosis (4Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Prior to anaphase, the sister chromatids are bound together by the cohesin protein complex that consists of Smc1, Smc3, a kleisin subunit (Scc1/Rad21/Mcd1), and Scc3 (known as SA1 and SA2 in vertebrates). At the metaphase-anaphase transition, APC/C together with its activator Cdc20 ubiquitinates securin and targets it for degradation (5Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 6Yu H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Securin is an inhibitor of separase, the protease that cleaves the Scc1 subunit of cohesin to allow sister chromatid separation. Therefore, the activation of APC/CCdc20 triggers the degradation of securin, activation of separase, cleavage of cohesin, and the onset of sister chromatid separation (7Bharadwaj R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The activity of APC/C is controlled by two related activators, Cdc20 and Cdh1. Both Cdc20 and Cdh1 contain a C-terminal WD40 repeat domain and are involved in recruiting substrates to APC/C (6Yu H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). APC/CCdc20 and APC/CCdh1 perform distinct functions. APC/CCdc20 is required for sister chromatid separation and the metaphase-anaphase transition by ubiquitinating securin and cyclin B1, whereas APC/CCdh1 mediates the degradation of a broader spectrum of substrates in late anaphase and early G1 (4Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Many APC/C substrates contain cis-elements or degrons, called the destruction box (D-box) or KEN box, that are required for their ubiquitination and degradation by APC/C. The spindle checkpoint is a cell cycle surveillance mechanism that ensures the accuracy of chromosome segregation and helps to maintain genetic stability (6Yu H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 7Bharadwaj R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). For sister chromatids to separate correctly, the two opposing kinetochores of a pair of sister chromatids must be captured by microtubules emanating from the two opposite poles of the mitotic spindle (bi-orientation). Once the pair of sister chromatids achieves bi-orientation, the kinetochores are under tension, because sister chromatid cohesion resists the spindle pulling force and holds the two sisters together. The spindle checkpoint senses the lack of attachment and tension at the kinetochore and transduces the signal to prevent premature sister chromatid separation until the correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment is established for all sister chromatids (7Bharadwaj R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The spindle checkpoint selectively inhibits the activity of APC/CCdc20, stabilizes securin, delays the activation of separase, and prevents premature sister chromatid separation (7Bharadwaj R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Bub1 is a key kinase involved in the spindle checkpoint signaling (8Yu H. Tang Z. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 262-265PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established the requirement of Bub1 for proper spindle checkpoint function (9Farr K.A. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2738-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Bernard P. Hardwick K. Javerzat J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Bub1 localizes to kinetochores from early prophase to metaphase, and the kinetochore localization of Bub1 is diminished after anaphase onset (11Taylor S.S. McKeon F. Cell. 1997; 89: 727-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Bub1 is also required for the kinetochore localization of other components of the spindle checkpoint, such as BubR1 and Mad2 in vertebrates and yeast (12Johnson V.L. Scott M.I. Holt S.V. Hussein D. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1577-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 13Sharp-Baker H. Chen R.H. J.

Furthermore, Bub1 phosphorylates Cdc20 directly and therefore inhibits the activity of APC/C (15Tang Z. Shu H. Oncel D. Chen S. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Cdc20 by Bub1 is required for efficient checkpoint signaling (15Tang Z. Shu H. Oncel D. Chen S. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Consistently, the kinase activity of Bub1 is enhanced in mitosis (15Tang Z. Shu H. Oncel D. Chen S. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Bub1 is regulated is still unknown. Bub1 is phosphorylated in mitosis in yeast (16Yamaguchi S. Decottignies A. Nurse P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1075-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), Xenopus (17Chen R.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Schwab M.S. Roberts B.T. Gross S.D. Tunquist B.J. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and mammalian cells (15Tang Z. Shu H. Oncel D. Chen S. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 19Qi W. Tang Z. Yu H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3705-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In Xenopus egg extract, the chromosome-associated Bub1 is hyperphosphorylated and exhibits higher autophosphorylation activity (17Chen R.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether phosphorylation regulates the kinase activity of Bub1 and whether there are additional mechanisms that regulate Bub1. Here we show that the Bub1 protein level oscillates during the cell cycle. Bub1 is degraded in late anaphase and G1 by APC/CCdh1. A fragment of Bub1 is ubiquitinated in vitro by APC/CCdh1. We further identify two KEN-boxes in human Bub1 that are required for its degradation in vivo and for its APC/C-dependent ubiquitination in vitro. A stable, inducible cell line that expresses a Bub1 mutant containing mutations in these two KEN-boxes undergoes mitotic exit with regular kinetics during the normal cell cycle or during the recovery from nocodazole-mediated mitotic arrest. Therefore, APC/CCdh1-dependent degradation of Bub1 is not required for the normal progression through mitosis. Instead, it may safeguard cells from prematurely accumulating Bub1 during G1 or quiescence. Plasmids, Antibodies, and Immunoblotting—The production of the Bub1, APC3 (Cdc27), and APC2 antibodies was described previously (5Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 15Tang Z. Shu H. Oncel D. Chen S. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 20Tang Z. Bharadwaj R. Li B. Yu H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The cyclin B1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The Cdh1 antibody was from Neomarker. HA and Myc antibodies were from Roche Applied Science. For immunoblotting, the antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution for crude sera or 1 μg/ml for purified IgG. Tissue Culture, Drug Treatments, and Transfection—HeLa Tet-On (Clontech) and HCT116 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm l-glutamine. To arrest cells at G1/S, cells were incubated in the growth medium containing 2 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 18 h. To obtain mitotic cells, the cultured cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 16–18 h. To analyze the stability of the Bub1 protein in late anaphase, the cells were treated with nocodazole for 16 h. Nocodazole was then washed out, and the cells were replated for 1 h before cycloheximide (50 μm) was added to the medium. Cells were harvested at different time points after cycloheximide addition. To analyze the protein stability in metaphase, cycloheximide was added without washing out nocodazole. Transfection was performed when cells reached about 50% confluence using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids were derived from pCS2-Myc or pCS2-HA. For RNAi experiments, the siRNA oligonucleotides targeting human Cdh1 (GAAGGGUCUGUUCACGUAUTT) was chemically synthesized by Dharmacon. HeLa cells were transfected as described (15Tang Z. Shu H. Oncel D. Chen S. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and analyzed 48 h after transfection. To establish cell lines that stably express Myc-Bub1 and Myc-Bub1-KdM, HeLa Tet-On cells at 40% confluence were transfected with pTRE2-hygro-Myc-Bub1 and pTRE2-hygro-Myc-Bub1-KdM plasmids. The cells were then selected with 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Clontech). The surviving clones were expanded and screened for the induced expression of Myc-tagged Bub1 proteins in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Clontech). FACS Analysis—HeLa Tet-on cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were fix with 70% ethanol that had been pre-cooled to –20 °C. After overnight fixation on ice, the cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. The data were acquired and analyzed using the CellQuest software. In Vitro Translation and Ubiquitination Assays—The in vitro transcription and translation system was purchased from Promega, and the reactions were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 80 ng of plasmid DNA, nuclease-free water, 0.2 μl of [35S]methionine (10 μCi/μl), and 4 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate were mixed to give a final volume of 5 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. The expression and purification of human Cdc20 and Cdh1 proteins from Sf9 cells were described previously (20Tang Z. Bharadwaj R. Li B. Yu H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). A fragment of Bub1 containing residues 520–653 (Bub1520–653) and the corresponding KEN-box mutants were expressed as His6-tagged fusion proteins in bacteria and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). The interphase APC/C was purified from interphase Xenopus egg extracts using anti-APC3/Cdc27 antibody coupled to protein A support. After washing with high salt XB buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 500 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) five times and with XB buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm sucrose) twice, the APC/C beads were incubated with recombinant Cdc20 or Cdh1 proteins for 1 h at room temperature. The APC/C beads were again washed twice with XB buffer and assayed for its ability to ubiquitinate an N-terminal fragment of human cyclin B1 or various Bub1 fragments. Each ubiquitination assay contained a 5-μl mixture of an energy-regenerating system, 150 μm ubiquitin, 5 μm recombinant ubiquitin-activating enzyme, 2 μm recombinant UbcH10, 1 μl of in vitro transcribed and translated substrates, and 3 μl of the APC/C beads. The reactions were incubated under constant shaking for 1 h at room temperature, quenched with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assays—The His6-tagged Cdc20 N-terminal fragment containing residues 1–170 (Cdc20NT) was expressed in bacteria and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) was coupled to Affi-Prep protein A beads (Bio-Rad) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-Bub1, Myc-Bub1-kinase dead (KD), or Myc-Bub1-KdM and treated with nocodazole. After 18 h, cells were lysed with the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μm okadaic acid, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin). After clearing by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C at 13,000 rpm, the lysate was incubated with the antibody beads for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were washed with the wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) three times and with kinase buffer two times. The proteins bound to the beads were then used directly in the kinase reactions. The kinase assays were performed in 20-μl reactions. Each reaction contains 100 μm cold ATP, 0.1 μCi/μl [32P]ATP, 1 μm Cdc20NT protein in the kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, quenched with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or immunoblotting with anti-Myc. Bub1 Is Degraded in Late Anaphase and G1—Previous studies showed that the Bub1 protein level is high in nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells but low in G1/S cells enriched by a thymidine block (21Taylor S.S. Hussein D. Wang Y. Elderkin S. Morrow C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4385-4395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Bub1 is regulated at the protein level and thus examined the steady state levels of Bub1 in synchronized human tissue culture cells. Cells were arrested at metaphase by nocodazole treatment, released into normal growth medium, and then harvested at the indicated time points. The level of Bub1 protein was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, the protein level of Bub1 decreased sharply as cells underwent mitotic exit, whereas the level of an APC/C subunit, APC2, remained constant (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The expression pattern of Bub1 was similar to that of cyclin B1, a well established APC/C substrate (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). The timing of Bub1 down-regulation was identical in HCT116 (Fig. 1A) and HeLa cells (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the decrease of the Bub1 protein level only occurred during mitotic exit following the recovery from nocodazole-mediated mitotic arrest, we synchronized HeLa cells at the G1/S boundary using a double-thymidine block. The cells were then released into fresh medium and harvested at different time points after release. The Bub1 protein accumulated gradually during G1 and S, peaked at G2/M, and dropped dramatically after mitosis (Fig. 1B). The expression pattern of Bub1 protein again mirrored that of cyclin B1 during this experiment. The reduction in the protein level of Bub1 during mitotic exit may be caused by increased protein degradation or decreased protein synthesis. To assess whether the reduction in the Bub1 protein level was because of protein degradation, we measured the half-life of Bub1 by cycloheximide (CHX) chase in nocodazole-arrested prometaphase cells and in late anaphase or early G1 cells released from nocodazole block for 1 h. We found that Bub1 was stable in prometaphase cells, and it was degraded with a half-life of about 1 h in late anaphase/early G1 cells (Fig. 1C). This result indicated that Bub1 was rapidly degraded during mitotic exit. Cdh1 Overexpression Reduces the Levels of Bub1 in Cells—The oscillation pattern of the Bub1 protein during the cell cycle is very similar to those of known substrates of APC/CCdh1, such as cyclin B1 (22King R.W. Peters J.M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), Cdc20 (23Prinz S. Hwang E.S. Visintin R. Amon A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 750-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and Plk1 (24Lindon C. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), suggesting that Bub1 may also be an APC/CCdh1 substrate. We thus tested whether Cdh1 promoted the degradation of Bub1 in cells. HeLa cells were co-transfected with vectors encoding Myc-Bub1 and HA-Cdh1 and treated with cycloheximide. The protein level of Myc-Bub1 was examined by α-Myc blot. The protein level of Myc-Bub1 was decreased considerably when Cdh1 was co-expressed (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 4). Furthermore, Myc-Bub1 was relatively stable in the absence of HA-Cdh1, whereas co-expression of HA-Cdh1 reduced the half-life of Myc-Bub1 to about 30 min (Fig. 2A). These results suggested that Bub1 might be a substrate of APC/CCdh1. The KEN-box Motifs of Bub1 Are Required for Its Cdh1-dependent Degradation in Vivo—Previous studies revealed that APC/C recognizes two types motifs in its substrates, the D-box (RXXLXXXXN) and the KEN-box (KEN) (25Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By sequence analysis, no D-boxes were found in human Bub1. However, two putative KEN-box motifs were identified in the central region of Bub1 (Fig. 2, B and C). We thus constructed Bub1 mutants in which the first KEN-box (K1M), the second KEN-box (K2M), or both KEN-boxes (KdM) were mutated to alanine residues, and we tested whether the protein levels of these Bub1 mutants were reduced by Cdh1 overexpression. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-Bub1 or the three Myc-Bub1 KEN-box mutants with or without the HA-Cdh1 expression vector. The protein levels of Myc-Bub1 mutants were examined by α-Myc blot. The protein levels of Bub1-K1M and Bub1-KdM were not significantly reduced in the presence of Cdh1 (Fig. 2D). Bub1-K2M also showed partial stabilization as compared with the wild-type Bub1 protein (Fig. 2D). These results indicated that both KEN-boxes are involved in the degradation of Bub1 and that the first KEN-box is the major degron of Bub1. The fact that degradation of Bub1 in the presence of excess amount of Cdh1 depended on KEN-boxes further suggested that Bub1 might be a substrate of APC/CCdh1. Bub1 Is Ubiquitinated by APC/CCdh1 in Vitro—To confirm that Bub1 was a substrate of APC/C, we tested whether immunopurified APC/CCdh1 directly catalyzed the ubiquitination of Bub1 in vitro. Human Bub1 is a large protein with 1085 residues. It would be difficult to resolve ubiquitin conjugates of the full-length Bub1 protein on SDS-PAGE. We thus designed three fragments of Bub1 as follows: Bub1-N, Bub1-M, and Bub1-C, each containing one-third of the Bub1 protein (Fig. 2B). The fragments were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and used as substrates in the ubiquitination assays. The N-terminal fragment of human cyclin B1 (residues 1–102) was used as the positive control (20Tang Z. Bharadwaj R. Li B. Yu H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Cyclin B1 was efficiently ubiquitinated by both APC/CCdh1 and APC/CCdc20 (Fig. 3A, left panel). Of the three Bub1 fragments, only Bub1-M was ubiquitinated by APC/CCdh1 but not by APC/CCdc20 (Fig. 3A). This indicates that Bub1 is a substrate of APC/CCdh1 and that the APC/C recognition elements of Bub1 are located in the central region of the protein. To further narrow down the ubiquitination sites and obtain more efficient ubiquitination of Bub1, we expressed and purified a fragment of Bub1 containing residues 520–653 (named Bub1520–653) in bacteria and tested it in the in vitro ubiquitination assay. The Bub1520–653 fragment was efficiently ubiquitinated by APC/CCdh1 and to a lesser extent by APC/CCdc20 (Fig. 3B). Both KEN-boxes are contained in the central fragment of Bub1 and in Bub1520–653. We therefore introduced the same KEN-box mutations into Bub1-M and Bub1520–653 and tested the ability of these mutants to be ubiquitinated by APC/CCdh1 in vitro. Consistent with the results from the in vivo degradation assay, mutation of the first KEN-box in Bub1-M dramatically decreased the amount of the polyubiquitinated species (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 2 and 4). Mutation of the second KEN-box had a less dramatic effect (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 2 and 6). Mutation of both KEN-boxes completely eliminated the ubiquitination of Bub1-M by APC/CCdh1 (Fig. 3B, lane 8). Similar results were obtained using recombinant purified Bub1520–653 and the corresponding KEN-box mutants as substrates (Fig. 3D). Mutation of either KEN-box decreased ubiquitination. Mutation of both KEN-boxes led to the loss of ubiquitination. Taken together, our results clearly establish that Bub1 is ubiquitinated by APC/C in vitro in a KEN-box-dependent manner. Cdh1 Mediates the Degradation of Bub1 in Vivo—To further test whether Cdh1 was required for the degradation of the endogenous Bub1 in vivo, we used siRNA to deplete Cdh1, and we measured the levels of the endogenous Bub1 and other known APC/C substrates, such as cyclin B1, by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). The Cdh1 siRNA efficiently knocked down the expression of Cdh1 (Fig. 4A). The steady state levels of Bub1 and cyclin B1 were significantly elevated in Cdh1-RNAi cells (Fig. 3A). This result suggested that APC/CCdh1 was a major ubiquitin ligase for the degradation of Bub1 in vivo. Because the protein level of Bub1 was higher in mitosis, an alternative explanation of this result was that depletion of Cdh1 by RNAi caused a mitotic arrest/delay, which in turn caused the accumulation of Bub1 as a secondary effect. To rule out this possibility, we performed FACS analysis of mock-transfected and Cdh1-RNAi cells (Fig. 4B). No significant differences were observed between the cell cycle profiles of the mock-transfected and Cdh1-RNAi cells (Fig. 4B). Therefore, our results are consistent with the notion that APC/CCdh1 mediates the degradation of Bub1 in vivo. We could not determine whether APC/CCdc20 is involved in Bub1 degradation in vivo, because Cdc20-RNAi causes a mitotic arrest in human cells. The KEN-box Mutant of Bub1 Is Stabilized during Mitotic Exit—We next tested whether the KEN-boxes of Bub1 are required for its degradation in vivo during mitotic exit. For this purpose, we established HeLa cell lines that stably expressed either Myc-Bub1 or Myc-Bub1-KdM driven by a tetracycline-inducible promoter. The stability of the Myc-Bub1 and Myc-Bub1-KdM proteins after nocodazole arrest-release was examined by blotting with anti-Myc antibody. As expected, Myc-Bub1 protein was degraded during mitotic exit after the recovery from the nocodazole-mediated mitotic arrest (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–6). In contrast, the Myc-Bub1-KdM protein was stable even at the 6-h time point after nocodazole release, when cells had already progressed to the G1 phase (Fig. 5A, lanes 7–12). By using cycloheximide treatment, we also measured the half-lives of the Myc-Bub1 and Myc-Bub1-KdM proteins in the cells that were released from nocodazole arrest for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, Myc-Bub1 had a half-life of about 1.5 h, and Myc-Bub1-KdM was stable during the course of the experiment. These results demonstrate that the KEN-box mutant of the Bub1 protein is not degraded during mitotic exit in vivo. We noticed that securin and cyclin B1 were degraded with normal kinetics in Bub1-KdM-expressing cells (Fig. 5A and data not shown), suggesting that degradation of Bub1 is not required for the exit from mitosis following the recovery from a nocodazole-mediated mitotic arrest. Degradation of Bub1 Is Not Required for Cellular Adaptation upon Prolonged Exposure to Nocodazole—We did not observe acute cell cycle arrest/delay as induced by Myc-Bub1-KdM. The protein level of Myc-Bub1-KdM in the presence of Dox was much higher than that of the endogenous Bub1, as the anti-Bub1 antibody only detected Myc-Bub1-KdM, not the endogenous Bub1, in this particular Western blot (Fig. 6A). Consistently, when the proliferative property of the Bub1-KdM-expressing clone was monitored, the growth curves of these cells in the absence or presence of doxycycline were very similar. Cells in both conditions divided with a doubling time of ∼25 h (Fig. 6B). To exclude the possibility that mutation of the KEN-boxes decreased the kinase activity of Bub1, we compared the kinase activities of Bub1-WT and Bub1-KdM using immunoprecipitation kinase assays. Bub1-KdM immunoprecipitated from mitotic HeLa cells showed similar kinase activities toward itself (autophosphorylation) and the N-terminal fragment of Cdc20 (Cdc20NT) as did Bub1-WT (Fig. 6C). A kinase-dead mutant of Bub1 (Bub1-KD) did not exhibit detectable kinase activity and was used as the negative control (Fig. 6C). Similar amounts of Bub1-WT, Bub1-KdM, and Bub1-KD were present in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6C). This result indicates that Bub1-KdM retains its kinase activity. It has been reported recently that another spindle checkpoint protein, BubR1, is degraded in polyploid cells that had adapted and survived a prolonged nocodazole treatment, and re-introduction of BubR1 causes apoptosis of these polyploid cells (26Shin H.J. Baek K.H. Jeon A.H. Park M.T. Lee S.J. Kang C.M. Lee H.S. Yoo S.H. Chung D.H. Sung Y.C. McKeon F. Lee C.W. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 483-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Re-introduction of Bub1 into these polypoid cells also causes apoptosis, although the apoptosis-inducing effect of Bub1 was less dramatic than that of BubR1 (26Shin H.J. Baek K.H. Jeon A.H. Park M.T. Lee S.J. Kang C.M. Lee H.S. Yoo S.H. Chung D.H. Sung Y.C. McKeon F. Lee C.W. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 483-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether induction of the expression of Bub1-KdM caused apoptosis in polyploid HeLa cells that had adapted during prolonged nocodazole treatment. HeLa cells were treated with nocodazole for the indicated duration in the presence or absence of doxycycline and were then harvested for FACS analysis. As shown in Fig. 6C, after 18 h of treatment, most of the cells in both conditions had 4N DNA content, indicating they were arrested in G2/M. By 54 h, almost all the cells were in the sub-G1 population, which corresponded to apoptotic cells. A minor population of cells was able to adapt and possessed 8N DNA content (polyploid) (Fig. 6C). However, doxycycline-induced expression of Bub1-KdM did not significantly alter the percentage of polyploid cells (Fig. 6C). Therefore, degradation of Bub1 did not appear to be required for the adaptation process when cells were subjected to a prolonged mitotic arrest. Bub1 Is a Substrate of APC/CCdh1—We have presented several lines of evidence to indicate that Bub1 is degraded during the exit from mitosis and that APC/CCdh1 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase for the ubiquitination of Bub1. First, the oscillation pattern of Bub1 closely resembles that of other APC/CCdh1 substrates, such as cyclin B1 (22King R.W. Peters J.M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) and Plk1 (24Lindon C. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Second, overexpression of Cdh1 decreases the level of ectopically expressed Bub1 in cells. Third, APC/CCdh1 ubiquitinates Bub1 in vitro. Fourth, mutation of KEN-boxes in Bub1 stabilizes Bub1 in vivo and abrogates Bub1 ubiquitination in vitro. Finally and most importantly, depletion of Cdh1 by RNAi leads to an accumulation of the Bub1 protein in living cells. The two related activators of APC/C, Cdc20 and Cdh1, are involved in recruiting substrates to APC/C (4Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 27Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). However, APC/CCdc20 and APC/CCdh1 perform distinct functions and are differentially regulated during the cell cycle (23Prinz S. Hwang E.S. Visintin R. Amon A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 750-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 28Visintin R. Prinz S. Amon A. Science. 1997; 278: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The functional difference between Cdc20 and Cdh1 is partly because of their different substrate specificities (6Yu H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Cdc20 recognizes the D-box in substrates (29Pfleger C.M. Lee E. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2396-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), whereas Cdh1 is less selective, recognizing a variety of elements, including the D-box, KEN-box, and other types of motifs (29Pfleger C.M. Lee E. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2396-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 30Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2274-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 31Araki M. Yu H. Asano M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2458-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have identified two KEN-boxes in Bub1 that are required for its ubiquitination and degradation, again consistent with APC/CCdh1 being the major form of APC/C that mediates Bub1 degradation. On the other hand, the involvement of APC/CCdc20 in Bub1 degradation in vivo cannot be formally excluded because Cdc20 RNAi is known to cause mitotic arrest. Both KEN-boxes of human Bub1 are required for its efficient degradation, although the first KEN-box appears to be the major degron. Interestingly, the first KEN-box is not conserved in Xenopus Bub1. One possibility is that the second KEN-box in Xenopus Bub1 functions as the degron. Alternatively, Xenopus Bub1 is not efficiently degraded following mitotic exit. Bub1 Degradation and Spindle Checkpoint Inactivation—Bub1 is required for the inhibition of APC/C when the spindle checkpoint is activated (15Tang Z. Shu H. Oncel D. Chen S. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Therefore, the degradation of Bub1 during mitotic exit is expected to contribute to the inactivation of the spindle checkpoint and may help to prevent the reactivation of the spindle checkpoint in late anaphase. However, expression of the nondegradable Bub1-KdM in cells does not result in a mitotic arrest. Cells expressing Bub1-KdM also undergo mitotic exit with normal kinetics during the recovery from a nocodazole-mediated mitotic arrest. These results suggest that degradation of Bub1 is not the sole mechanism to inactivate the spindle checkpoint in mammalian cells. Recently, the yeast spindle checkpoint kinase, Mps1, has been shown to be degraded by APC/C (32Palframan W.J. Meehl J.B. Jaspersen S.L. Winey M. Murray A.W. Science. 2006; 313: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Forced expression of Mps1 in anaphase re-establishes the spindle checkpoint. It has been proposed that the mutual inhibition of Mps1 and APC/C forms a feedback loop to control the inactivation of the spindle checkpoint in anaphase (32Palframan W.J. Meehl J.B. Jaspersen S.L. Winey M. Murray A.W. Science. 2006; 313: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, overexpression of Mps1 is sufficient to cause mitotic arrest that is dependent on the spindle checkpoint in yeast (33Hardwick K.G. Weiss E. Luca F.C. Winey M. Murray A.W. Science. 1996; 273: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of Mps1 does not result in mitotic arrest in mammalian cells 3W. Qi and H. Yu, unpublished data. (34Stucke V.M. Sillje H.H. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This important difference suggests that mechanisms regulating the activation and inactivation of the spindle checkpoint are more complex in mammalian cells than in yeast. Nevertheless, Mps1 is degraded during mitotic exit in mammalian cells. 3W. Qi and H. Yu, unpublished data. Degradation of Mps1 might contribute to checkpoint inactivation in mammalian cells. In addition, several other spindle checkpoint proteins, including Aurora B and Plk1, have been shown to be degraded in an APC/C-dependent manner. It is thus possible that degradation of multiple spindle checkpoint proteins by APC/C mediates spindle checkpoint inactivation and mitotic exit. On the other hand, Cdh1–/– chicken DT40 cells are viable and proliferate with very similar rate as the wild-type DT40 cells (35Sudo T. Ota Y. Kotani S. Nakao M. Takami Y. Takeda S. Saya H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6499-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This argues against a major role of APC/CCdh1 in mitotic exit and against a requirement for APC/CCdh1-mediated degradation of spindle checkpoint proteins in mitotic exit. In addition to regulation of its protein levels, Bub1 is phosphorylated in mitosis by Cdk1 (19Qi W. Tang Z. Yu H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3705-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (17Chen R.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The activity of Bub1 is regulated by phosphorylation in Xenopus egg extracts (17Chen R.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, dephosphorylation of Bub1 may be another mechanism to inactivate the spindle checkpoint. Indeed, Bub1 is rapidly dephosphorylated when Cdk1 is inhibited by roscovitine (19Qi W. Tang Z. Yu H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3705-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that phosphorylation of Cdc6 protects it from APC/CCdh1-mediated degradation (36Mailand N. Diffley J.F. Cell. 2005; 122: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that degradation of Bub1 might also be regulated by the phosphorylation state of Bub1. In support of this notion, the phosphorylation sites identified on Bub1 are in the vicinity of the KEN boxes (17Chen R.H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Qi W. Tang Z. Yu H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3705-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the future, it will be interesting to examine whether dephosphorylation of Bub1 is a key mechanism for its inactivation and whether dephosphorylation and degradation of Bub1 are two coupled events during mitotic exit. We thank the members of the Yu laboratory for helpful discussions."

Homologous CTDs were identified in phage proteins belonging to three different protein families: neck appendage proteins of several Bacillus phages, L-shaped tail fibers of coliphage T5, and K5 lyases, the tail spike proteins of phages infecting E. coli K5. By analyzing a representative of each family, we show that in all cases, the CTD is cleaved off after a strictly conserved serine residue and alanine substitution prevented cleavage. Further structural and functional analyses revealed that (i) CTDs are autonomous domains with a high α-helical content; (ii) proteolytically released CTDs assemble into hexamers, which are most likely dimers of trimers; (iii) highly conserved amino acids within the CTD are indispensable for CTD-mediated folding and complex formation; (iv) CTDs can be exchanged between proteins of different families; and (v) proteolytic cleavage is essential to stabilize the native protein complex. Data obtained for full-length and proteolytically processed endosialidase variants suggest that release of the CTD increases the unfolding barrier, trapping the mature trimer in a kinetically stable conformation. In summary, we characterize the CTD as a novel C-terminal chaperone domain, which assists folding and assembly of unrelated phage proteins.

The largest group of bacteriophages, the order of tailed phages (Caudovirales), has evolved tail spike and fiber proteins for efficient virus-host interactions (1Ackermann H.W. Adv. Virus Res. 1998; 51: 135-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These specialized adhesins mediate recognition and attachment to the bacterial surface and are the key determinants for host specificity. Since a variety of pathogenic bacteria are protected by thick layers of lipopolysaccharides or capsular polysaccharides, many tail spike proteins possess enzymatic activity. In particular, phages infecting encapsulated bacteria crucially depend on polysaccharide depolymerases (endoglycosidases or lyases) to gain access to the bacterial membrane (2Stirm S. Freund-Mölbert E. J. Virol. 1971; 8: 330-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lindberg A.A. Sutherland I.W. Surface Carbohydrates of the Prokaryotic Cell. Academic Press, Inc., London1977: 289-356Google Scholar). In mature phage particles, tail spikes and fibers are exposed structures, which require high stability to maintain their functional conformation even under extreme conditions like high salt concentrations, the presence of extracellular proteases, and variations in pH and temperature. Interestingly, many spikes and fibers are built up by homotrimers that contain stretches of intertwined subunits like coiled-coil, triple β-helix, or triple β-spiral folds, leading to protein complexes that remain stable even in the presence of SDS (4Weigele P.R. Scanlon E. King J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4022-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One example are endosialidases, the tail spike proteins of Escherichia coli K1-specific phages.

Microbiol. 2005; 8: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), K1-specific phages evolved by insertion of an endosialidase gene into the tail spike or fiber locus of diverse progenitor phages (17Stummeyer K. Schwarzer D. Claus H. Vogel U. Gerardy-Schahn R. Mühlenhoff M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thereby, the N-terminal capsid-binding domain of the original spike or fiber protein is kept to ensure proper integration of the newly acquired tail spike into existing tail architectures. Recently, we solved the crystal structure of the conserved catalytic part of endosialidase endoNF 2The abbreviations used are: endoNF, endo-N-acetylneuraminidase or endosialidase (EC 3.2.1.129) of bacteriophage K1F; aa, amino acids; CTD, C-terminal domain; gp12, gene product 12. (aa 246–911), the tail spike of phage K1F (18Stummeyer K. Dickmanns A. Mühlenhoff M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Ficner R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The protein assembles into a catalytic homotrimer with an overall mushroom-like outline. In the cap region, each subunit is folded into a 6-bladed β-propeller typical for sialidases and a lectin-like β-barrel domain, which is involved in binding of polysialic acid. The distal part of the protein forms a stalk region, where all three subunits intertwine into a β-helix fold, which is interrupted by a β-prism domain. The catalytic part is flanked by the N-terminal capsid binding domain (aa 1–245) and a short C-terminal domain (CTD; aa 912–1064). During maturation, the CTD is released by proteolytic cleavage after a highly conserved serine residue (19Mühlenhoff M. Stummeyer K. Grove M. Sauerborn M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12634-12644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Exchange of this residue by alanine (S911A in endoNF) prevents cleavage but not assembly into active trimers, demonstrating that proteolytic processing is not a prerequisite for complex formation and activity. Although the CTD is not part of the native trimer, folding and trimerization of endosialidases crucially depend on the presence of an intact CTD in the nascent polypeptide. Truncation or even the exchange of a single histidine residue within the domain prevented trimerization and led to accumulation of inactive and predominantly insoluble protein (19Mühlenhoff M. Stummeyer K. Grove M. Sauerborn M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12634-12644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Gerardy-Schahn R. Bethe A. Brennecke T. Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Ziesing S. Lottspeich F. Frosch M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the CTD is not restricted to endosialidases. Homologous domains were found as part of other tail spike and fiber proteins, suggesting a general role in folding and assembling of phage proteins (19Mühlenhoff M. Stummeyer K. Grove M. Sauerborn M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12634-12644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on the structural and functional characterization of the CTD as part of an endosialidase but also of other spike and fiber proteins derived from distinct phages. The CTD acts as an intramolecular chaperone, probably by lowering a high energy barrier on the folding pathway. By analyzing a novel C-terminal chaperone domain, essential for folding and assembly of unrelated proteins, this work contributes not only to our understanding of bacteriophage evolution but might form the basis for engineering highly stable protein complexes.

Cloning of Tail Spike and Fiber Proteins—The coding sequences of the tail genes encoding endoNF, gp12, LTF, and ElmA were amplified from purified phage DNA of coliphage K1F, Bacillus phage GA-1, coliphage T5, and genomic DNA of E. coli K5, respectively, using the following primer pairs: endoNF, MM97 (5′-cgggatccatgtccacgattacacaattc-3′) and MM98 (5′-gtccgctcgagcttctgttcaagagcagaaag-3′); ΔN-endoNF lacking the first 245 aa, MM147 (5′-cgggatccgctaaaggggatggtgtc-3′) and MM98 (5′-gtccgctcgagcttctgttcaagagcagaaag-3′); GA-1 gene 12, DS01 (5′-cgggatccatgcatagaccgccattc-3′) and DS02 (5′-ggcctcgagactcaacctttcaagcttc-3′); LTF, DS03 (5′-cgggatccatggctataactaaaataattc-3′) and DS04 (5′-ggcctcgagcatacctaatttatcctc-3′); ElmA, DS07 (5′-cgggatccatgacggtctcaaccgaa-3′) and DS08 (5′-ggcctcgagattccctgttaattgcaa-3′). Sense and antisense primers are flanked by BamHI and XhoI sites (underlined), respectively. PCR products were ligated into BamHI/XhoI sites of the expression vector pET22b-Strep, a modified pET22b vector containing the sequence encoding an N-terminal Strep-tag II followed by a thrombin cleavage site (WSHPQFEKGALVPRGS) and a C-terminal His6 tag. The sequence identity of all PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. The amplified ltf gene showed five sequence deviations from the sequence published by Kaliman et al. (21Kaliman A.V. Kulshin V.E. Shlyapnikov M.G. Ksenzenko V.N. Kryukov V.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) but was identical to the recently published sequence of Wang et al. (22Wang J. Jiang Y. Vincent M. Sun Y. Yu H. Wang J. Bao Q. Kong H. Hu S. Virology. 2005; 332: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was performed by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's guidelines with the following primer pairs (mutated nucleotides are shown in boldface type): MM148 (5′-ccctattgttacttctgccggggagaggaaaacag-3′) and MM149 (5′-ctgttttcctctccccggcagaagtaacaataggg-3′) for endoNF-N912A; MM150 (5′-gctcgtattcacttcgcggttattgctcagc-3′) and MM151 (5′-gctgagcaataaccgcgaagtgaatacgagc-3′) for endoNF-G956A; DS45 (5′-gggtgaggagtggggtgttgcgcctgacggaattttctttgc-3′) and DS46 (5′-gcaaagaaaattccgtcaggcgcaacaccccactcctcaccc-3′) for endoNF-R1035A; DS25 (5′-cgggtgctattaacacagctgacgagagacataaaacgg-3′) and DS26 (5′-ccgttttatgtctctcgtcagctgtgttaatagcacccg-3′) for gp12-S620A; DS63 (5′-cgggtgctattaacacatctgcagagagacataaaacggac-3′) and DS64 (5′-gtccgttttatgtctctctgcagatgtgttaatagcacccg-3′) for gp12-D621A; DS65 (5′-aggcgaagaagctagatatgcatttggggttatcgctcaac-3′) and DS66 (5′-attgagcgataaccccaaatgcatatctagcttcttcgcct-3′) for gp12-H663A; DS67 (5′-gaagaagctagatatcattttgcggttatcgctcaacagattg-3′) and DS68 (5′-caatctgttgagcgataaccgcaaaatgatatctagcttcttc-3′) for gp12-G665A; DS49 (5′-ggcaacatctacagcatagcacctaccgaatgtcaatgg-3′) and DS50 (5′-ccattgacattcggtaggtgctatgctgtagatgttgcc-3′) for gp12-R720A; DS27 (5′-ccgtaaatggtacaattaacacagctgatgctagattgaagaacgatgttcg-3′) and DS28 (5′-cgaacatcgttcttcaatctagcatcagctgtgttaattgtaccatttacgg-3′) for LTF-S1264A; DS41 (5′-cagcgtttacggtgctagccgatgcgcgtttcaagactgc-3′) and DS42 (5′-gcagtcttgaaacgcgcatcggctagcaccgtaaacgctg-3′) for elmA-S675A. Plasmids containing the corresponding wild-type sequence were used as a template. PCR products were subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pET22b-Strep resulting in a construct with an N-terminal Strep-tag and a C-terminal His6 tag. Generation of C-terminally Truncated Proteins—Constructs encoding C-terminally truncated proteins were generated by PCR with the following primer pairs: MM124 (5′-ggaattccatatggagataactcag-3′) (NdeI) and MM126 (5′-atccgctcgagttaagaagtaacaatagggtt-3′) (XhoI) for endoNFΔC (aa 246–911), DS29 (5′-ggttctactctagaagatggtgcagg-3′) (XbaI) and DS30 (5′-atccgctcgagttaagatgtgttaatagcacc-3′) (XhoI) for gp12ΔC (aa 621–740), DS15 5′-gcgatcccgggtcgattc-3′ (SmaI) and DS31 (5′-atccgctcgagttaagatgtgttaatagcacc-3′) (XhoI) for LTFΔC (aa 1265–1396), DS37 (5′-cggaaactgccccaacg-3′) and DS44 (5′-atccgctcgagttaggacagcaccgtaaacgctg-3′) (XhoI) for elmAΔC (aa 676–820). PCR products were subcloned into pET22b-Strep using the respective restriction sites given in parentheses, resulting in constructs that encode for proteins with an N-terminal Strep-tag. Generation of an Expression Plasmid Encoding the CTD of EndoNF—For separate expression of the endoNF CTD, DNA encoding aa 913–1064 3Cleavage of endoNF occurs after the highly conserved Ser-911, releasing a CTD that starts with Asn-912. Asparagine residues, in particular in front of a glycine, are very labile and can undergo spontaneous degradation. Consequently, N-terminal sequencing of the released CTD revealed Gly-913 as the first amino acid (19Mühlenhoff M. Stummeyer K. Grove M. Sauerborn M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12634-12644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the construct generated for separate expression of the endoNF CTD was designed accordingly. of endoNF was amplified by PCR with the primer pair MM183 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGGGGAGAGGAAAACAGAGC-3′ (NdeI site) and MM98 5′-GTCCCTCGAGCTTCTGTTCAAGAGCAGAAAG-3′ (XhoI site). The obtained PCR product was subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of pET22b, resulting in a construct encoding the CTD of endoNF with a C-terminal His6 tag. Generation of Chimera—The chimera ΔN-endoNF-gp12 was generated by homologous recombination in E. coli YZ2000 cells (Gene Bridges) (23Zhang Y. Muyrers J.P. Testa G. Stewart A.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) using the primers DS69 5′-GCAACCGTTTCACCACTGCATACCTCGGAAGCAACCCTATTGTTACTTCTgacgagagacataaaacggacatagc-3′ (uppercase, nt 2684–2733 of the endoNF gene; lowercase, nt 1861–1886 of gene 12) and DS70 5′-gtaatacgactcactatagggcgaattgggtaccgggccccccCTCGAGACTCAACCTTTCAAGCTTCCTTC-3′ (lowercase, nt 2198–2220 of gene 12; uppercase, nt 615–673 of pBluescript-SK–; underlined, XhoI site). A plasmid containing the coding sequence of wild-type gp12 was used as a template, and the resulting PCR product was recombined with the linearized plasmid pBluescript-ΔN-endoNF containing the coding sequence of endoNF lacking the N-terminal 245 amino acids. The product was subcloned into pET22b-Strep, resulting in a construct encoding aa 246–911 of endoNF with an N-terminal Strep-tag fused to aa 621–740 of gp12 with a C-terminal His6 tag. Protein Expression and Purification—Proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21-Gold(DE3) in the presence of 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. Bacteria were cultivated in Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C (endoNF) or in PowerBroth (Athena Enzyme Systems) at 15 °C (gp12, LTF, and ElmA). At an optical density (A600) of 0.6, expression of endoNF was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and bacteria were harvested 2.5 h after induction. Expression of gp12, LTF, and ElmA was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of 1.5, and bacteria were harvested 20 h after induction. Bacterial lysates were obtained by adding 2% (w/v) SDS and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, followed by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were precipitated by adding 10 volumes of acetone, and pellets were resuspended in sample buffer containing 1.5% (w/v) SDS. For the analysis of soluble and insoluble proteins, bacteria were lysed in BugBuster MasterMix (Novagen), and soluble and insoluble fractions were obtained after centrifugation (22,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). For protein purification, bacteria were lysed by sonication in appropriate loading buffer containing protease inhibitors, and soluble fractions were loaded on StrepTactin-Superflow (IBA) and HisTrap HP columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. To isolate proteolytically matured protein, the minor fraction of noncleaved protein was removed by passing samples over a HisTrap column prior to StrepTactin chromatography. For isolation of CTDs, proteolytically processed and full-length proteins were removed by StrepTactin chromatography before samples were loaded on a HisTrap column. Buffer exchange was performed on a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for endoNF and gp12, respectively. The column was calibrated using the gel filtration molecular weight markers (MW-GF-200) from Sigma. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions using 2.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and either 1.5% or 1% (w/v) SDS in the sample buffer. For Western blot analysis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose (Whatman). Proteins containing an N-terminal Streptag II were detected by StrepTactin-alkaline phosphatase-conjugate (StrepTactin-AP; IBA) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. His6-tagged proteins were detected with 1 μg/ml penta-His antibody (Qiagen) followed by goat anti-mouse-IgG-AP (Dianova). Determination of Endosialidase Activity—The enzymatic activity of endoNF variants was determined by means of the thiobarbituric acid assay as described earlier (19Mühlenhoff M. Stummeyer K. Grove M. Sauerborn M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12634-12644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism and Secondary Structure Estimation— Purified proteins were analyzed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) by far-UV CD on a J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) in 1-mm and 0.1-mm path quartz cells. The 1-mm spectra (4-fold accumulation, 250 to 200 nm) were used for scaling the 0.1-mm spectra (16-fold accumulation, 250 to 182 nm) adjusting path length deviations of the 0.1-mm cell. The 0.1-mm spectra were analyzed for estimation of the secondary structure by use of the program CDpro suite (24Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 383: 318-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 25Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). Protein Sequence Analysis—Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the ClustalV method of the MegAlign program version 6.1 (DNAstar Inc.) with the following parameters: gap penalty 15.0 and gap length penalty 10.0. The phylogenetic tree was calculated from the aligned sequences using the maximum likelihood method with molecular clock (Promlk version 3.6a3) in Phylip. The tree was printed with tree view (version 1.6.6). Thermostability Assay—Purified protein in 1.5% SDS sample buffer was incubated for 5 min at a variety of temperatures in the range of 4–95 °C. Samples were placed on ice until further analysis by SDS-PAGE. Phage Proteins Containing an Endosialidase CTD—Using BLAST search analysis with the C-terminal sequence of endoNF (aa 908–1064), we identified a total of 13 phage proteins containing a similar domain. The identified proteins belong to diverse phages and can be grouped into four protein families (Table 1). Proteins of family I and II are capsular polysaccharide depolymerases specific for the respective host capsule, whereas members of family III and IV are neck appendage and tail fiber proteins, respectively, involved in phage adsorption. According to their different enzymatic or binding specificities, no sequence similarity is observed in the N-terminal part of proteins belonging to different families. The only observed relation between these proteins is found in their CTDs. By multiple sequence alignment, six amino acid clusters with conserved amino acids were identified, which are dispersed in regions of low sequence similarity (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The proteolytic cleavage site Ser↓Asx identified in endosialidases (19Mühlenhoff M. Stummeyer K. Grove M. Sauerborn M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12634-12644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) is located in cluster I and is strictly conserved in all proteins. The CTDs are of variable length (105–163 aa) with overall amino acid sequence similarities ranging from 10.8 to 44.9% (see Table 1). A phylogenetic tree based on the 13 CTD sequences revealed that similarities are not necessarily highest between members of one family (Fig. 1A), since CTDs of family I and III are split up into two different branches.TABLE 1Bacteriophage proteins containing an endosialidase CTDProteinaAccession numbers of the used protein sequences are given in the legend to Fig. S1 in the supplemental material.OriginFunctionProtein lengthCleavage siteLength of CTDSimilaritybPrimary sequence similarity of the respective CTD in comparison to the CTD of endoNF.aaaa%Endosialidases endoNEColiphage K1EDegradation of α2,8-linked polysialic acid811Ser-70610523.9 endoNFColiphage K1F1064Ser-911153100.0 endoN63DColiphage 63D984Ser-85213244.9 endoNK1-5Coliphage K1-5811Ser-70610522.9K5 capsule depolymerases K5 lyase (KflA)Coliphage K5Degradation of poly(β1,4-GlcA-α1,4-GlcNAc)635Ser-50612931.6 K5 lyaseColiphage K1-5632Ser-50512731.3 K5 lyase (ElmA)E. coli K5cThe elmA gene is found in some E. coli K5 strains and might be part of a not yet characterized prophage (28).820Ser-67514526.8Neck appendage proteins gp12Bacillus phage GA-1Binding of the host cell wall receptor740Ser-62012037.1 gp12Bacillus phage φ29854Ser-69116311.5 (22.3)dPrimary sequence similarity of the respective CTD compared with the CTD of gp12 of Bacillus phage GA-1 as determined by the Jotun-Hein method of the MegAlign program. gp12Bacillus phage PZA854Ser-69116310.8 (21.4)dPrimary sequence similarity of the respective CTD compared with the CTD of gp12 of Bacillus phage GA-1 as determined by the Jotun-Hein method of the MegAlign program. gp12Bacillus phage B103860Ser-69716310.8 (18.8)dPrimary sequence similarity of the respective CTD compared with the CTD of gp12 of Bacillus phage GA-1 as determined by the Jotun-Hein method of the MegAlign program.

Open table in a new tab Maturation of Proteins with Endosialidase CTD—To investigate whether all proteins containing the endosialidase CTD undergo proteolytic processing, representatives of each family shown in Table 1 were selected and compared with endoNF: the K5 lyase ElmA, the neck appendage protein gp12 of Bacillus phage GA-1, and the LTF (L-shaped tail fiber protein) of coliphage T5 (see Fig. 1B for a schematic representation). Proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 with an N-terminal Strep-tag and a C-terminal His6 tag. Protein maturation was analyzed by Western blotting, and results are shown in Fig. 2. Since the N-terminal capsid binding domain of endosialidases is not required for trimerization and activity (17Stummeyer K. Schwarzer D. Claus H. Vogel U. Gerardy-Schahn R. Mühlenhoff M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Stummeyer K. Dickmanns A. Mühlenhoff M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Ficner R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), an endoNF variant lacking the first 245 amino acids (ΔN-endoNF) was used in this study (see Fig. 1B for schematic representation). For each selected protein, two mutants were generated by (i) deletion of the respective CTD (ΔC) and (ii) alanine substitution of the highly conserved serine in the Ser↓Asx motif. Notably, all investigated proteins were proteolytically cleaved, resulting in a large N-terminal (Fig. 2, A–D) and a short C-terminal fragment (Fig. 2E). Depending on the cleavage efficiency, variable amounts of full-length proteins were observed (Fig. 2, A–D), which were detectable by the N- and C-terminal epitope tags (see upper and lower panels in Fig. 2, A–D, respectively). Proteolytically processed proteins (marked with an asterisk) were only detectable by the N-terminal Strep-tag due to loss of the His6-tagged CTD during maturation. In all cases, the apparent molecular mass of the mature protein was similar to the mass of the respective truncated variant lacking the CTD (ΔC), indicating that all proteins were cleaved at the predicted Ser↓Asx cleavage site. Moreover, exchange of the highly conserved serine residue to alanine prevented cleavage, resulting in the expression of full-length proteins (Fig. 2, A–D). In summary, these results demonstrate that cleavage at the Ser↓Asx site is used for release of CTDs in proteins of all four families and that this cleavage is independent of the N-terminal protein context. Functional Role of the CTD in Nonendosialidase Proteins— To investigate the functional role of the CTD in a protein context other than endosialidases, the neck appendage protein gp12 was chosen as a model protein and compared with endoNF. The two molecules derive from completely unrelated phages, namely Bacillus phage GA-1, infecting the Gram-positive soil bacterium B. pumilus, and phage K1F, infecting Gram-negative, pathogenic E. coli K1, respectively. EndoNF and gp12 were expressed in E. coli BL21 with an N-terminal Strep-tag and a C-terminal His6 tag, and the soluble fraction of the obtained bacterial lysates was analyzed as depicted in Fig. 3. Like endoNF, gp12 formed an oligomeric complex that is resistant to SDS at room temperature. By omitting the boiling step prior to SDS-PAGE, a high molecular weight band appeared for either protein, whereas in parallel, the intensity of the band corresponding to monomeric, proteolytically processed protein (endoNF* and gp12*) decreased. SDS-resistant complexes were only detectable by the N-terminal Strep-tag, demonstrating that they are built up exclusively by mature protein lacking the CTD. In nonboiled samples, a larger proportion of gp12* than ΔN-endoNF* was found in the monomeric state (compare second lanes from the left in Fig. 3, A and B), an indication that gp12 oligomers are less stable in the presence of SDS than endoNF trimers. Similar to the results obtained for endoNF, truncated gp12, which lacks the CTD already in the nascent protein (gp12ΔC), was found exclusively as an insoluble, SDS-sensitive species (lane i)."
https://openalex.org/W2013517216,"Excess androgen synthesis by thecal cells is invariably detrimental to preovulatory follicles in the ovary and is considered a fundamental characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome in women. Investigators have long postulated that granulosa cell-derived estrogens modulate thecal cell steroidogenesis via a short negative-feedback loop within the follicle. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the steroidogenic capacity of individual wild-type (WT) and estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha)-null follicles when cultured in vitro under comparable conditions. Late-stage ER alpha-null follicles exhibited markedly increased expression of the thecal cell enzyme CYP17A1 and secreted much greater amounts of its end product, androstenedione. This phenotype was reproduced in WT follicles when exposed to an aromatase inhibitor or ER-antagonist, and prevented when the former treatment was supplemented with an ER alpha-specific agonist. ER alpha-null follicles also exhibited increased testosterone synthesis due to ectopic expression of hydroxysteroid (17beta) dehydrogenase type 3 (HSD17B3), a testis-specific androgenic enzyme. These data indicate that ER alpha functions within thecal cells to negatively modulate the capacity for androgen synthesis by repressing Cyp17a1 expression, and the biological activity of androgens produced by inhibiting Hsd17b3 expression. Hence, these findings provide novel evidence of an intraovarian ER alpha function that may be critical to the latter stages of folliculogenesis and overall ovarian function."
https://openalex.org/W2017230110,"PDZ domains are ubiquitous peptide-binding modules that mediate protein-protein interactions in a wide variety of intracellular trafficking and localization processes. These include the pathways that regulate the membrane trafficking and endocytic recycling of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an epithelial chloride channel mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis. Correspondingly, a number of PDZ proteins have now been identified that directly or indirectly interact with the C terminus of CFTR. One of these is CAL, whose overexpression in heterologous cells directs the lysosomal degradation of WT-CFTR in a dose-dependent fashion and reduces the amount of CFTR found at the cell surface. Here, we show that RNA interference targeting endogenous CAL specifically increases cell-surface expression of the disease-associated ΔF508-CFTR mutant and thus enhances transepithelial chloride currents in a polarized human patient bronchial epithelial cell line. We have reconstituted the CAL-CFTR interaction in vitro from purified components, demonstrating for the first time that the binding is direct and allowing us to characterize its components biochemically and biophysically. To test the hypothesis that inhibition of the binding site could also reverse CAL-mediated suppression of CFTR, a three-dimensional homology model of the CAL·CFTR complex was constructed and used to generate a CAL mutant whose binding pocket is correctly folded but has lost its ability to bind CFTR. Although produced at the same levels as wild-type protein, the mutant does not affect CFTR expression levels. Taken together, our data establish CAL as a candidate therapeutic target for correction of post-maturational trafficking defects in cystic fibrosis.

Even for WT CFTR, a large fraction of newly synthesized protein is degraded before reaching the apical membrane (8Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and the protein that does is subjected to continual endocytosis and endocytic recycling (9Bradbury N.A. Cohn J.A. Venglarik C.J.

As a result, regulation of CFTR intracellular trafficking is important for its function in both physiological and pathological contexts. Genetic, biochemical, and cell biological studies have revealed a complex network of protein-protein interactions that are required for correct CFTR trafficking, including a number of PDZ (PSD-95, discs-large, zonula occludens-1) proteins, which act as adaptor molecules, coupling CFTR to other components of the trafficking and localization machinery, and to other transmembrane channels and receptors (11Kunzelmann K. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 167-170PubMed Google Scholar, 12Guggino W.B. Stanton B.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Class I PDZ domains typically recognize C-terminal binding motifs characterized by the sequence–(S/T)-X-Φ-COOH (where Φ represents a hydrophobic side chain, and X represents any amino acid) (13Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Brône B. Eggermont J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C20-C29Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic C terminus of CFTR satisfies the class I PDZ binding motif, ending in the sequence -DTRL (15Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

Earlier work in some of our laboratories had shown that the CFTR C-terminal PDZ-binding motif controls retention of the protein at the apical membrane and modulates its endocytic recycling (18Moyer B.D.

PDZ proteins that have been shown to interact with CFTR include NHERF1 (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1; also known as EBP50), NHERF2 (aka E3KARP), NHERF3 (aka CAP70, PDZK1, or NaPi CAP-1), NHERF4 (aka IKEPP or NaPi CAP-2), and CAL (CFTR-associated ligand; aka PIST, GOPC, and FIG) (12Guggino W.B.

Overexpression of CAL in heterologous cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the plasma-membrane levels of CFTR (21Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M.

In the case of CFTR, the effect is mediated by reductions in the rate of membrane insertion and in the half-life of the channels at the cell surface (21Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1892-1898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The negative effect of CAL overexpression on CFTR expression levels can also be reversed by the simultaneous overexpression of NHERF1, which competes for the C-terminal TRL binding motif (21Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), or by overexpression of TC10, a Rho GTPase whose constitutively active form redistributes CAL intracellularly toward the plasma membrane (26Cheng J. Wang H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3731-3739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It thus appears that CAL plays an important role in the intracellular trafficking and localization of CFTR. Furthermore, because high levels of CAL reduce CFTR levels, it is possible that endogenous CAL acts as a negative regulator. If so, targeted modulation of the CAL-CFTR interaction could provide a mechanism for up-regulating CFTR trafficking in a therapeutic context, in analogy to the rescue of ΔF508-CFTR seen upon overexpression of NHERF1 (27Guerra L. Fanelli T. Favia M. Riccardi S.M. Busco G. Cardone R.A. Carrabino S. Weinman E.J. Reshkin S.J. Conese M. Casavola V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40925-40933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, previous studies have focused on the effects of CAL overexpression on WT-CFTR. As a result, no evidence has been available as to whether endogenous CAL is limiting for CFTR expression nor whether its effects apply to disease-associated mutants. Furthermore, analysis of the regulatory interactions has so far been confined to heterologous cells, even though trafficking pathways depend strongly on cellular context (28Yoshimori T. Keller P. Roth M.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 29Tuma P.L. Nyasae L.K. Hubbard A.L. Mol. Biol.

In the experiments reported here, we test the hypothesis that suppression of endogenous CAL expression levels will increase the cell-surface expression of functional ΔF508-CFTR and that it will do so in a polarized human bronchial epithelial cell line. In addition, we assess the ability of a localized mutational knock-out of the CAL PDZ binding pocket to abrogate CAL-mediated suppression of cell-surface CFTR, providing new insights into the mechanism of interaction. Taken together, our results establish the potential therapeutic relevance of pharmaceutical inhibition of the CAL PDZ binding domain. siRNA-mediated Targeting of Endogenous CAL Expression—CFBE41o- cells (31Bruscia E.

Clancy (University of Alabama, Birmingham) and were maintained in the Dartmouth CF Core Facility. Monolayers of CFBE+ΔF508 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected with 160 nm CAL-specific siRNA (GOPC3; Qiagen) or nonspecific siRNA (control, non-silencing siRNA; Qiagen) or an equal volume of medium, using the transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 20 h, cells were provided with fresh medium. To measure cell-surface CFTR, 72 h after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), incubated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce; 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 8.2) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed, lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 Complete tablet/50 ml (Roche)), collected using a cell scraper (Sarstedt), and centrifuged. An aliquot of clarified whole-cell lysate (WCL) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with CFTR-, CAL-, and ezrin-specific antibodies. The remaining clarified WCL was incubated with streptavidin beads overnight at 4 °C, after which the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer/dithiothreitol (DTT) at 85 °C for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed with antibodies specific for CFTR, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and the Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunit. Horseradish perioxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used for visualization. For experiments with polarized monolayers, CFBE+ΔF508 cells were seeded at low density. For biochemical experiments, 105 cells were seeded on 24-mm diameter Transwell filters (Corning) and allowed to grow for 3 days prior to transfection. For electrophysiological experiments 3.3 × 104 cells were seeded on 12-mm diameter Snapwell filters (Corning), and allowed to grow for 4 days prior to transfection. In both cases, subconfluent monolayers were transfected overnight with 50 nm CAL-specific or nonspecific siRNA (GOPC3 or control, non-silencing siRNA, respectively; Qiagen), using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Confluent monolayers were allowed to form, and cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and switched to 27 °C for 24–36 h prior to experimentation to increase signal intensity. Monolayers were apically biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce), and WCL and surface-biotinylated samples were prepared and analyzed as described above for non-polarized cells. Electrophysiology—Seven days after seeding monolayers, Ussing chamber measurements were performed essentially as described (34Swiatecka-Urban A. Moreau-Marquis S. Maceachran D.P. Connolly J.P.

For these studies, 50 μm genistein was applied apically to activate temperature-rescued ΔF508-CFTR channels (34Swiatecka-Urban A. Moreau-Marquis S. Maceachran D.P. Connolly J.P. Stanton C.R. Su J.R.

Data are reported as the difference between the genistein-activated and the CFTRinh-172-inhibited short-circuit currents (Isc). Recombinant Protein Expression Vectors—Full-length human CAL (GenBank™ accession AF450008; TrEMBL accession number Q969U8) was subcloned into the pET16b expression vector (Novagen) on an NdeI/BamHI fragment generated by PCR to yield the vector pHCAL1. The 5′ primer was designed to introduce a decahistidine purification tag at the N terminus of the construct. The CAL PDZ domain (amino acids 278–362) was also PCR subcloned into pET16b as an NdeI/BamHI fragment to yield the vector pHCALP5. Its 5′ primer was designed to introduce an N-terminal decahistidine tag followed by a TEV protease recognition sequence. CAL-binding site mutants were prepared using the QuikChange and Multichange protocols (Stratagene) in the eukaryotic expression vector pECFP-CAL, containing full-length CAL inserted as an EcoRI/BamHI fragment into the pECFP-C1 backbone (Clontech): “CAL-D” = S294D,T296E,K340D,K342E; “CAL-E” = K299D,K340D,K342E; and “CAL-T+L” = L291E,G292E,I295E,H341F,L348N. Full-length and PDZ domain mutant constructs were subcloned into the bacterial expression vectors described above and into the mammalian expression vector encoding HA-tagged full-length CAL (25Cheng J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1892-1898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). pGST-CFTRC, encoding C-terminal residues 1377–1480 of CFTR as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in the pGEX-4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare), was obtained from the Dartmouth Cystic Fibrosis Core Facility and was originally a generous gift of Drs. P. Devarajan and A. Swiatecka-Urban. pGST-CFTRCΔTRL was PCR subcloned as a BamHI/SalI site fragment into pGEX-4T-1. All protein expression constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression—pHCAL1-transformed BL21(DE3) RIL cells (Novagen) were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to an A600 of ∼0.6. Protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and allowed to proceed for 16 h at 20 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer T (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ATP, 25 units/ml benzonase (EMD Biosciences), 2 mm MgCl2, supplemented with one EDTA-free Complete tablet per 50 ml) and lysed using a French press. pHCALP5-transformed BL21(DE3) RIL cells were grown at 37 °C in 2× YT medium to an A600 of ∼0.8. Induction, expression, and lysis conditions were identical to those for full-length CAL, except that the lysis buffer did not contain glycerol. Isotopically labeled CAL PDZ protein was expressed for NMR analysis in 15N M9 minimal media (including 1× BME vitamins (Sigma), 4 mg/liter thiamine HCl (Sigma), and 1% (w/v) glucose). 15NH4Cl was obtained from Spectra Stable Isotopes or Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Mutant CAL and CAL-PDZ proteins were expressed under the same conditions as wild-type proteins. pGEX-4T-1-, pGST-CFTRC-, and pGST-CFTRCΔTRL-transformed BL21(DE3) cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to an A600 of ≥0.6. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and allowed to proceed overnight at 20 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer ((phosphate-buffered saline (PBS): 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3), 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 μg/ml DNase I (Roche), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgSO4, supplemented with 1 Complete tablet in 50 ml). After incubation for 30 min on ice, the cells were lysed using a French press. Protein Purification—All lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm in a Ti45 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. Imidazole was added to the CAL-PDZ supernatants to a final concentration of 10 mm before application to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Super-flow (Qiagen) column (bed volume 10 ml), which had been pre-equilibrated with 5 column volumes (CV) of TBS-CAL (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ATP), containing 10 mm imidazole. Following sample application, the column was washed with 10 CV of TBS-CAL containing 10 mm imidazole, and protein was eluted in TBS-CAL with a linear gradient of 10–400 mm imidazole over 20 CV. Eluates were collected in tubes containing Chelex 100 Molecular Biology grade resin (Bio-Rad). CAL was purified using a similar protocol, except that TBS-CAL was supplemented for metal affinity chromatography with 10% (w/v) glycerol and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. CAL- or CAL-PDZ-containing fractions were pooled, centrifuged at 3700 × g for 10 min, and filtered through a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore) to remove any residual Chelex resin. GST-CFTRC fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Sigma) (bed volume 12 ml). The column was equilibrated with 3 CV of PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (ICN; PBS/Tween). Following sample application, the column was washed with 5 CV of PBS/Tween and the fusion protein eluted with 4 CV of PBS containing 25 mm glutathione. The pooled eluates were applied to HiLoad Superdex 200 (CAL; GST-CFTRC) or Superdex 75 (CAL-PDZ) prep grade 16/60 or 26/60 size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns (GE Healthcare) in TBS-CAL containing 0.02% sodium azide and 25 mm, instead of 50 mm Tris (CAL; CAL-PDZ) or in PBS/Tween (GST-CFTR fusions). The purity of all proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE. CAL was concentrated in Amicon Ultra-15 10,000 MWCO, CAL-PDZ in Centricon Plus 80 Biomax-5 5,000 MWCO, and GST-CFTR fusion proteins in Amicon Ultra-15 30,000 MWCO concentrators (Millipore). Following concentration, the oligomeric homogeneity of CAL and CAL-PDZ proteins was verified by analytical SEC. Pull-down Binding Assay—Pull-down experiments were carried out by directly mixing the two proteins under a given interaction condition described below. 500 μl of glutathione-Sepharose bead slurry (Sigma) was aliquoted into an Eppendorf tube. After a brief centrifugation (1,000 × g; 1 min), the liquid above the beads was carefully aspirated. The beads were equilibrated twice with 1 ml each of PBS/Tween. An aliquot containing 200 μg of GST or GST fusion protein was added (after removal of residual glutathione using a PD10 desalting column; GE Healthcare), and the volume adjusted to 1 ml with the same buffer. The mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h with shaking every 10 min to permit GST capture. After centrifuging the tubes for 5 min at 1000 × g, unbound material was discarded, and the beads were washed thoroughly. An aliquot containing 200 μg of CAL or CAL-PDZ proteins was added to the captured GST or GST fusion protein, and the volume adjusted to 1 ml. The interaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h on ice with shaking every 10 min. After complex formation was completed, to remove unbound protein, the beads were repeatedly washed until the supernatant contained no protein as detected using Bradford reagent. The washed beads were resuspended with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 3 min at 95 °C, and bound proteins visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. Homology Modeling—Homology modeling was performed via the web-based SWISS-MODEL server (38Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4445) Google Scholar). In one case, the program selected the templates automatically (Protein Data Bank entries 1QAV and 2PDZ, both syntrophin; 1UEZ, KIAA1526 PDZ1; 1UF1, KIAA1526 PDZ2; 1BE9, PSD-95 PDZ3). In a second case, the program was provided with a user-defined template (Protein Data Bank entry 1I92) corresponding to the NHERF1-PDZ1-CFTRC crystal structure (39Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A.

The latter model was combined with the CFTR C-terminal peptide contributed by a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal lattice to generate the model of the CAL·CFTR complex shown in Fig. 4. Least-squares superpositions were performed using the program LSQKAB (40Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2326) Google Scholar).

Mass Spectrometry and NMR Analysis of CAL Protein and Mutants—Following SEC purification, wild-type CAL, CAL-D, and CAL-E mutants and the corresponding PDZ domain proteins were subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis in the Dartmouth Molecular Biology & Proteomics Core Facility. The CAL-PDZ-D mutant domain was also subjected to 1H,15N-heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) analysis, as described (42Piserchio A. Fellows A. Madden D.R. Mierke D.F.

Assays of CFTR Expression in the Presence of CAL-binding Site Mutants—A GFP-CFTR fusion protein was expressed in African green monkey kidney (COS-7) cells in the presence or absence of wild-type and mutant HA-CAL. Both proteins were detected by Western blotting as previously described (25Cheng J. Wang H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

Endogenous CAL Down-regulates ΔF508-CFTR Cell-Surface Expression—Our previous studies had shown that overexpression of CAL in heterologous cell lines reduces the levels of recombinant WT-CFTR found in whole cell lysates and at the cell surface. This effect could be blocked by the overexpression of NHERF1 together with CAL (21Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

We investigated the transcriptional mechanisms underlying the establishment of an efficient PDR response in budding yeast.

This early PDR response (ePDR) is highly dependent on the Pdr1p transcription factor, which is also one of the major genetic determinants of long term PDR acquisition. The activity of Pdr1p in early drug response is not drug-specific, as two chemically unrelated drugs, benomyl and fluphenazine, elicit identical, Pdr1p-dependent, ePDR patterns. Our data also demonstrate that Pdr1p is an original stress response factor, the DNA binding properties of which do not depend on the presence of drugs.

All living organisms have developed complex transcriptional responses for rapidly adapting genome expression to the presence of toxic compounds in the environment. These responses involve various types of cellular pathway. Genome-wide studies of drug responses in microorganisms have revealed that these responses comprise both specific effects depending on the precise chemical nature and cellular targets of the toxic compound and a general stress response (environmental stress response (ESR) 5The abbreviations used are: ESR, environmental stress response; MDR, multidrug resistance; PDR, pleiotropic drug resistance; ePDR, early pleiotropic drug response; PDRE, pleiotropic drug response element; STRE, stress response element; CDRE, calcineurin-dependent response element; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction; ChIP-chip, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA chip analysis; IP, immunoprecipitation; WCE, whole cell extract; FDR, false discovery rate; ORF, open reading frame. in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae), reflecting cell adaptation to growth defects and cellular damages, regardless of the type of stress encountered by the cell (1.Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3735) Google Scholar). In between these very specific and very general responses, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have evolved multidrug resistance (MDR) pathways, which confer resistance to a broad spectrum of unrelated chemicals, but which are restricted to the stress responses associated with organic drugs. From bacteria to humans, MDR is essentially based on the overexpression of membrane transporters able to export a large number of chemically different compounds (2.Borst P. Elferink R.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 3.Li X.Z. Nikaido H. Drugs. 2004; 64: 159-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 4.Prasad R. Kapoor K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 242: 215-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). MDR is a major concern for human health, as it leads to antibiotic resistance in pathogens and enables cancer cells to survive chemotherapy. In the model yeast S. cerevisiae, MDR is referred to as PDR (pleiotropic drug response). The PDR network currently comprise 10 transcription factors regulating about 70 different target genes (Refs. 5.DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A.

Pdr1p and its functional homologue, Pdr3p, were identified in the early 1990s as regulators of the basal level of drug resistance in yeast cells (19.Balzi E. Chen W. Ulaszewski S. Capieaux E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16871-16879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Delaveau T. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Gain- or loss-of-function alleles of PDR1 and PDR3 confer resistance or sensitivity to a large panel of unrelated drugs, through constitutive modifications to the expression of ATP binding cassette transporters (e.g. Pdr5p, Snq2p, or Yor1p); major facilitator superfamily members (e.g. Flr1p, Tpo1p) or enzymes modifying the lipid composition of the plasma membrane (e.g. Pdr16p, Rsb1p, Ipt1p) (reviewed in Ref. 21.Kolaczkowska A. Goffeau A. Drug Resist Updat. 1999; 2: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). PDR1 and PDR3 display some functional redundancy, as the inactivation of both genes is required to have any major effect on the steady-state level of expression of their target genes, and Pdr1p and Pdr3p recognize the same DNA consensus motif (PDRE for pleiotropic drug response element) (16.Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22.Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Pdr1p has been shown to modulate the in vivo expression and to bind in vitro to the promoters of genes encoding two other PDR regulators, namely PDR3 and YRR1, which are positively autoregulated (11.Zhang X. Cui Z. Miyakawa T. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8812-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16.Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, Pdr1p has been hypothesized to be at the top of a positive regulation loop leading to the overexpression of PDR effectors upon drug treatment (16.Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, although the role of Pdr1p in maintaining basal levels of yeast multidrug resistance has been clearly established, its role in the drug-mediated regulation of PDR genes remains unclear. Pdr1p is required for the PDR5 response to cycloheximide, a process which seems to require the auto-activation of PDR3 (16.Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The induction of PDR5 and TPO1 (encoding a MDR permease) expression in response to herbicides (methyl-chlorophenoxyacetic acid and dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is much weaker in the absence of either Pdr1p or Pdr3p (10.Teixeira M.C. Sa-Correia I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, Wehrschutz et al. (23.Wehrschutz-Sigl E. Jungwirth H. Bergler H. Hogenauer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have shown that the deletion of both PDR1 and PDR3, despite strongly reducing PDR5 basal expression, does not abolish the induction of this gene upon cycloheximide or diazaborine treatment. Similar results have been reported for the ABC transporter Snq2p, the expression of which is slightly up-regulated by 4-nitroquinoline (4-NQO) independent of PDR1 and PDR3 (24.Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Most of what we know about the PDR network has emerged from experiments carried out in the absence of drugs using gain-of-function or knock-out versions of the PDR transcription factors. Therefore, very little is known about the dynamic functioning of the PDR network in general, and the role of the Pdr1p transcription factor in PDR acquisition. The physiological relevance of the PDR network also remains to be investigated on a genome-wide scale. We carried out a genome-wide study of the role of Pdr1p in the early dynamic response of the yeast transcriptome to fluphenazine. We combined the data obtained with the results of a previous microarray analysis of the yeast response to benomyl, an inhibitor of microtubule assembly, carried out in our laboratory (25.Lucau-Danila A. Lelandais G. Kozovska Z. Tanty V. Delaveau T. Devaux F. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1860-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fluphenazine belongs to the phenotiazine family of antipsychotic drugs. Phenotiazines are calmodulin antagonists, as they bind to calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner and alter its capacity to activate its cellular targets (26.Motohashi N. Kawase M. Saito S. Sakagami H. Curr. Drug Targets. 2000; 1: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We chose fluphenazine because: 1) It efficiently up-regulates the transcription of CDR1 and CDR2, the functional homologues of PDR5 and SNQ2 in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans (27.Henry K.W. Cruz M.C. Katiyar S.K. Edlind T.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1968-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2) It differs from benomyl, in terms of both its chemical structure and its cellular targets. 3) Calcineurin, one of the main targets of calmodulin, modulates drug susceptibility in S. cerevisiae (28.Edlind T. Smith L. Henry K. Katiyar S. Nickels J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and is important for PDR activation in C. albicans (29.Sanglard D. Ischer F. Marchetti O. Entenza J. Bille J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 959-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We found that Pdr1p actually played a major role in the full fluphenazine induction of the expression of many PDR genes. The global fluphenazine and benomyl responses clearly differed, but the sets of Pdr1p-dependent genes induced by the two drugs were strikingly similar. The induction of this set of genes may thus represent the physiological early pleiotropic drug response (ePDR). Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in the absence and presence of fluphenazine showed that Pdr1p was constitutively bound to its target DNA, even in the absence of drugs. Thus, Pdr1p is a promoter-resident protein involved in both the basal expression and response to drugs of PDR genes. This study provides a genome-wide view of dynamic Pdr1p functioning in the early drug response in yeast. Yeast Strains−All the strains used in this study were derived from the BY4742 (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0) background. The wild-type, pdr1Δ, pdr3Δ, pdr8Δ, yrr1Δ, yrm1Δ, elm1Δ, and crz1Δ strains were ordered from the Euroscarf collection. The pdr1Δpdr3Δ strain was constructed using the pdr3Δ strain, from which PDR1 was deleted with pAD-ΔPDR1 (30.Decottignies A. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. de Wet H. McIntosh D.B. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12612-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Briefly, pAD-ΔPDR1 was digested with EcoRI and NotI. This generated a fragment including the URA marker flanked by sequences from the PDR1 promoter and terminator regions, respectively. This fragment was inserted in place of the wild-type PDR1 sequence, by homologous recombination, using a standard yeast transformation protocol (31.Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). The deletion was controlled by PCR using forward primer (GCTAACTATTCATCTCAGCCAAG) and reverse primer (AGGAGATCGCCCTAGAAAACAG). Thirteen Myc tags were added to the part of the chromosomic PDR1 corresponding to the C terminus of Pdr1p as described in Ref. 32.Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar. The primers used were: GGAAGGAAGTTTTTGAGAACTTTTATCTATACAAACGTATACGTGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC and GGACCTCTACAGTATCCTGTGGAGCGACGTTTATCCAGATAGTCGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA. This PCR fragment was inserted into the yeast genome by homologous recombination, using a standard lithium acetate yeast transformation protocol (33.White C.I. Sedgwick S.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 201: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We checked that Myc-tagged proteins were correctly produced by Western blotting with the 9E10 antibody (anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody, Roche Applied Science). Growth Conditions and Drug Treatments−For time course analysis of the fluphenazine response, strains were cultured in YPD (1%(w/v) bacto-yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bacto-peptone, 2% (v/w) glucose) up to an A600 of 0.5. The culture was split in two. Fluphenazine (Sigma) was dissolved in water to a concentration of 10 mg/ml (stock solution). Fluphenazine was added to one of the two cultures, to the concentration of 40 μg/ml. An equivalent volume of water was added to the other culture. Cells were incubating for various periods of time (2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 min) and were then harvested by pouring 15 ml of culture into 30 ml of ethanol, storing at -80 °C, and centrifuging. Transcriptome Analyses−Microarrays containing oligonucleotides for probing most of the ORF of S. cerevisiae were produced by local microarray facilities. These microarrays contained 40-mer oligonucleotides from MWG deposited onto Corning ultragap slides, using an Omnigrid II spotter from Biorobotics (Genomic Solutions), with each gene represented twice on the array. The protocol for these microarray experiments can be obtained from the authors. Each experiment was performed at least twice, with independent biological samples, using dye swap. The arrays were read with a Genepix 4000B scanner and analyzed with Genepix Pro 4.0 (Axon Instruments Inc.). Artifactual, saturated or low-signal spots were excluded from the analysis. Print-tip lowess normalization was carried out using the Varan software with default parameters (34.Golfier G. Dang M.T. Dauphinot L. Graison E. Rossier J. Potier M.C. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1641-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The expression profiles of genes with more than 80% missing values were eliminated. The remaining missing values were replaced using the KNN-imputation method, available from GEPAS (35.Vaquerizas J.M. Conde L. Yankilevich P. Cabezon A. Minguez P. Diaz-Uriarte R. Al-Shahrour F. Herrero J. Dopazo J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W616-W620Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Gene expression profiles were clustered using Genesis (36.Sturn A. Quackenbush J. Trajanoski Z. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 207-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar). RT-qPCR Analyses−RT-qPCR were performed as described in Ref. 37.Garcia M. Darzacq X. Devaux F. Singer R. Jacq C. Herrmann L.A. Yeast Mitochondrial Transcriptomics. Methods in Molecular Biology: Mitochondria. Humana Press Inc, Totowa2007Google Scholar. The primers were: ICT1, ACCAGCTAAACGTTTTGAAGTGG and ACCTTGATTGTCTGTGGTTGCAC; YOR1, CGAAATGACACCTCCAGAGTC and GTG GACTTACCAGCACCTGTACG; SNQ2, CTGTGGTGTTACACAACCTGTC and CATGTACTCTCCACACGTTGAGC; ACT1, GGTTGCTGCTTTGGTTATTG and GACCCATACCGACCATGATAC. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation on DNA Arrays (ChIP-chip)−Overnight cultures of tagged or wild-type yeasts were used to inoculate 100 ml of fresh YPD medium at 0.1 A600. Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6-0.8. One 50-ml subculture was then treated with 40 μg/ml fluphenazine for 10 min, and the other 50 ml was incubated with an equivalent amount of water. Each culture was fixed by adding 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Fixation was stopped by adding 340 mm glycine and incubating for 5 min. Fixed cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with TBS. ChIP extracts, IP, ligation-mediated PCR, labeling, slide preparation, and hybridization were carried out as described in Ref. 38.Harismendy O. Gendrel C.G. Soularue P. Gidrol X. Sentenac A. Werner M. Lefebvre O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4738-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar. For qPCR analysis of specific promoters, we used 15% of each sample as described in Ref. 37.Garcia M. Darzacq X. Devaux F. Singer R. Jacq C. Herrmann L.A. Yeast Mitochondrial Transcriptomics. Methods in Molecular Biology: Mitochondria. Humana Press Inc, Totowa2007Google Scholar. The primers were: RPN4, GCACTGAGAGGACGTTACTTC and CGGAACTTTCTAGAACCATCAC; PDR5, GACTCGTGATTCCGTGGAAAGG and CAGCCATAAGGTTATGCACATC; SNQ2, CTCACCGCTATCGCCTCACCAC and GATGCACTGAGAATGTAATGCAC and YGR035c, GTTTCCTACGGCAGAATAAGACC and ATTGCCCTCAAAACTGTATCTCATC. The ACT1 primers described above were used for normalization. For ChIP-chip analyses, we used arrays previously described in Ref. 38.Harismendy O. Gendrel C.G. Soularue P. Gidrol X. Sentenac A. Werner M. Lefebvre O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4738-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, encompassing 14,178 PCR products for all yeast genomic elements. Immunoprecipitated DNA from tagged or wild-type cells was used for competitive hybridization against Whole Cell Extract (WCE) from the same culture. Each experiment was repeated at least four times, using dye swap. Arrays were scanned using a GenePix 4100A scanner and fluorescence ratios were determined with GenePix Pro 5.1. Artifactual spots were excluded and local background was subtracted from the intensity of the signal. R-software was used for further analyses. The signals were normalized using the print-tip median. Log2(IP/WCE) was calculated for each DNA sequence. The median log2 value for the four experiments was used to reflect the relative enrichment in the immunoprecipitate, for a given locus. Only loci with a significant signal in at least 3 of 4 experiments were considered. For each sequence, a Z-score, corresponding to the enrichment value after centering and scaling the global distribution of all log2 enrichment values (Z = (E-μ)/S, where E is the median log2 value of the enrichment of the sequence, μ is the median value, and S the standard deviation for all enrichments) was calculated. The IP was considered to be significantly enriched in DNA sequences with a Z-score of more than 3. Genes with a Z score above 3 in one of the conditions tested but an enrichment ratio in the IP lower than the enrichment ratio in the mock IP plus 2.5 standard deviations were considered to be nonspecifically bound by Pdr1p. Microarray Data Download−All microarray data and supplemental materials are publicly available (see Supplementary Materials). The early fluphenazine response of yeast cells was analyzed, using a dose of fluphenazine with negligible impact on growth that nonetheless induced a clear transcriptional response. Preliminary studies indicated that the 40 μg/ml dose was the most appropriate for our purposes (data not shown). This dose is similar to that used in previous studies to induce MDR transporters in the pathogenic yeast C. albicans (27.Henry K.W. Cruz M.C. Katiyar S.K. Edlind T.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1968-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As we were interested in studying the very early drug response rather that the long term adaptation of the cells, we analyzed the yeast transcriptome response after 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 min of exposure to fluphenazine, comparing this response with that of cells incubated with water for the same amount of time (mock treatment). We identified 160 genes with expression profiles clearly modified by fluphenazine addition. Hierarchical clustering analyses of these genes indicated that the response of yeast to 40 μg/ml of fluphenazine was transient, peaking at 10 min under our conditions. Repressed genes displayed similar, transient, and progressive changes in expression, whereas gene activation patterns were more heterogeneous, ranging from short, early pulses to late, progressive modifications (Fig. 1, left panel). Bioinformatic Analyses of the Fluphenazine Response−We used the T-profiler software to investigate the functional significance of these expression profiles (39.Boorsma A. Foat B.C. Vis D. Klis F. Bussemaker H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W592-W595Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We found that six different regulatory DNA motifs were predicted to play a role in the early fluphenazine response (Fig. 2). Three of these motifs, rRPE, rRNA, and PAC, were associated with transient repression. The rRPE and rRNA motifs have been identified in silico in the promoters of genes involved in rRNA processing (40.Hughes J.D. Estep P.W. Tavazoie S. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 41.Kellis M. Patterson N. Birren B. Berger B. Lander E.S. J. Comput. Biol. 2004; 11: 319-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The PAC motif is derived from the rRNA motif and has been identified in in silico analyses of the promoters of ESR genes, the expression of which is repressed under stress conditions (1.Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3735) Google Scholar, 39.Boorsma A. Foat B.C. Vis D. Klis F. Bussemaker H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W592-W595Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Genes containing the STRE motifs, corresponding to the DNA binding sequence of Msn2p/Msn4p, were induced very early and transiently (maximum t-value at 5 min) in our experiments. Msn2p/Msn4p are known to control the induction of stress-responsive genes involved in the ESR (1.Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3735) Google Scholar). Finally, the last two groups of motifs were associated with the induction of a second wave of genes (20-80 min). The first of these two DNA motifs has been identified in the promoter sequences of target genes of the Crz1p transcription factor in in silico analyses (39.Boorsma A. Foat B.C. Vis D. Klis F. Bussemaker H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W592-W595Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Crz1p is known to bind to the CDRE (calcineurin-dependent response element) and is thought to be the major transcription factor target of the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (42.Cyert M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 43.Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31079-31088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The final group of motifs are variations of the PDRE, which is recognized by the Pdr1p/Pdr3p transcription factors (5.DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This last result suggests that the pleiotropic drug response is an important component of the early response to fluphenazine. Four Main Functional Groups Are Involved in the Fluphenazine Response−These bioinformatic predictions were fully confirmed investigating the functional annotation of the 160 genes represented in Fig. 1. Indeed, about one-third of the repressed genes were directly or indirectly associated with rRNA metabolism and function (Fig. 1, right panel). About 30 of 80 activated genes are known to be regulated by Msn2p/Msn4p or to contain a STRE in their promoters. Many of these genes encode proteins of the carbohydrate and energy reserve metabolism pathways (e.g. the glycogen phosphorylase GPH1, the glycogen synthase GSY2, the trehalose 6-P phosphate synthase subunits TSL1, TPS2 and TPS3, the hexokinase HXK1, the glucokinase GLK1, the phosphoglucomutase PGM2, the glucose transporters HXT6/7, the glycerol phosphatases GPD1 and HOR2). Some genes encoding chaperones, including cytosolic (Hsp42p, Hsp104p) and mitochondrial (Hsp78p) heat shock proteins, were also induced by fluphenazine. Most of these Msn2p/Msn4p-responsive genes were induced early and transiently (Fig. 1, right panel). 25% of genes induced by fluphenazine in Fig. 1 are known to be dependent on calcineurin and the major calcineurin-dependent transcription factor, Crz1p for their stress-mediated expression (43.Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31079-31088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 44.Viladevall L.

These genes encode proteins involved in vacuole morphogenesis and protein maturation (e.g. the peptidases PEP4, CPS1, and YPS1; the mannosyl transferase MNT4), a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (Cmk2p) and Tis11p, involved in the regulation of mRNA stability. Most of these genes were induced after the Msn2/Msn4 response (10-40 min), with the notable exception of CMK2, which was induced as early as 5 min after fluphenazine treatment. Thus, in contrast to what had been observed in calcineurin mutants or in cells treated with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (43.Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D.

Finally, we found that 15 genes encoding proteins of the pleiotropic drug response pathway were induced by fluphenazine (Fig. 1). These genes encode multidrug transporters (PDR5, YOR1, SNQ2), proteins involved in lipid metabolism and membrane properties (RSB1, SNG1, PLB1) or the stress response (ICT1, YLR346c, YGP1, GRE2, HXK1). Some of these genes (RSB1, YLR346c, HXK1) were already induced at 5 min and their level of expression subsequently decreased; some (ICT1, SNQ2, PDR5, YOR1, SNG1, YGP1, GRE2, YAL061w) were induced from 10 min and were still significantly overexpressed at 80 min. Among the 15 PDR genes activated, 13 are potential targets of Pdr1p and/or Pdr3p (Fig. 1). The remaining two genes (PLB1 and SNG1) are potential targets of Yrr1p, Pdr8p, and Yrm1p (7.Hikkel I.

In this study, we further identified a classic inducible enhancer located between -5 and -6 kb in the hiNOS upstream promoter. This 1 kb promoter sequence functions as a cytokine-inducible enhancer in an orientation- and position-independent manner in human lung A549 and liver AKN1 cells. This DNA enhancer also confers cytokine inducibility to the heterologous thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was applied, and confirmed cytokine-inducible in vivo DNA-protein interactions within this enhancer region. In vivo functional binding of both NF-kappaB (p65/p50) and Stat-1alpha at the -5.8 kb human iNOS promoter site was significantly increased in A549 cells after cytokine stimulation, while only Stat-1alpha bound at the -5.2 kb site. These results identify the -5 to -6 kb promoter region as a classic transcriptional enhancer for the human iNOS gene and provide definitive in vivo evidence of specific NF-kappaB and Stat-1 nuclear protein binding that mediates transcription of the hiNOS gene under cytokine stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2008130469,"Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB involves its release from the inhibitory protein IκBα in the cytoplasm and subsequently, its translocation to the nucleus. Whereas the events responsible for its release have been elucidated, mechanisms regulating the nuclear transport of NF-κB remain elusive. We now provide evidence for actin cytoskeleton-dependent and -independent mechanisms of RelA/p65 nuclear transport using the proinflammatory mediators, thrombin and tumor necrosis factor α, respectively. We demonstrate that thrombin alters the actin cytoskeleton in endothelial cells and interfering with these alterations, whether by stabilizing or destabilizing the actin filaments, prevents thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and consequently, expression of its target gene, ICAM-1. The blockade of NF-κB activation occurs downstream of IκBα degradation and is associated with impaired RelA/p65 nuclear translocation. Importantly, thrombin induces association of RelA/p65 with actin and this interaction is sensitive to stabilization/destabilization of the actin filaments. In parallel studies, stabilizing or destabilizing the actin filaments fails to inhibit RelA/p65 nuclear accumulation and ICAM-1 expression by tumor necrosis factor α, consistent with its inability to induce actin filament formation comparable with thrombin.

The released NF-κB undergoes rapid nuclear translocation and subsequent binding to NF-κB responsive elements to activate transcription of target genes including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; CD54), an inducible endothelial adhesive protein that serves as a counter-receptor for β2-integrins (CD11/CD18) present on the surface of leukocytes (12Diamond M.S.

Despite the fact that the nuclear translocation constitutes the key step of NF-κB activation, mechanisms underlying the nuclear transport of NF-κB are uncertain; it is likely that they may involve association of the liberated RelA/p65 with cytoplasmic structures such as actin cytoskeleton. The actin cytoskeleton is dynamic, and the rates of polymerization and depolymerization of actin are critical determinants of many cellular responses including transcriptional regulation (25Hofmann W.A.

Fazal F. Malik A.B. Rahman A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6965-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These findings led us to compare the alterations in actin cytoskeleton induced by thrombin and TNFα and address the role of these alterations in mediating NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. Using a combination of fluorescence microscopy and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that RelA/p65 associates with actin, accumulates in the nucleus, and induces ICAM-1 expression after thrombin stimulation of endothelial cells. Disruption of thrombin-induced alterations in actin cytoskeleton, either by stabilizing or destabilizing the actin filaments, interferes with the association of RelA/p65 with actin, impairs the nuclear uptake of RelA/p65, and prevents the expression of ICAM-1. We also show that TNFα is incapable of inducing actin stress fiber formation comparable with thrombin and consequently, stabilization or destabilization of the actin filaments fails to inhibit TNFα-induced RelA/p65 nuclear uptake and ICAM-1 expression. These findings are consistent with the existence of actin cytoskeleton-dependent and -independent mechanisms that may be engaged in a stimulus-specific manner to facilitate RelA/p65 nuclear import and thereby ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. Materials—Human thrombin was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Polyclonal antibodies to IκBα, p65/RelA, and β-actin, and a monoclonal antibody to ICAM-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). In addition, polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore Corp. (Bradford, MA); cytochalasin D, latrunculin B, and jasplakinolide were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA); plasmid maxi-kit was from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA); and the protein assay kit and nitrocellulose membrane were from Bio-Rad. Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin and Texas Red goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other materials were from VWR Scientific Products Corp. (Gaithersburg, MD). Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures were established as described previously (34Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Cotran R.S. Folkman J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 60: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 35Wagner D.D. Olmsted J.B. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) by using umbilical cords collected within 48 h of delivery. Cells were cultured as described (35Wagner D.D. Olmsted J.B. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) in gelatin-coated flasks using endothelial basal medium 2 with bullet kit™ additives (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). HUVEC used in the experiments were between 3 and 6 passages. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and reverse transcription was performed using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Human ICAM-1 and GAPDH were amplified using the following primer set: ICAM-1 (forward, 5′-AGCAATGTGCAAGAAGATAGCCAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGTCCCCTGCGTGTTCCACC-3′) and GAPDH (forward, 5′-TATCGTGGAAGGACTC-ATGACC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TACATGGCAACT-GTGAGGGG-3′). Reverse transcription product (2 μl) was amplified in a 50-μl volume containing 0.5 μmol of primers and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The reaction conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 67 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 25 cycles for ICAM-1 amplification, and 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min for 25 cycles for GAPDH amplification as described (36Minhajuddin M. Fazal F. Bijli K.M. Amin M.R. Rahman A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5823-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Normalization of ICAM-1 expression was achieved by comparing the expression of GAPDH for the corresponding sample. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting— After treatment, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation (RIPA) buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Sigma). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies as described (33Anwar K.N. Fazal F. Malik A.B. Rahman A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6965-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 37Qiao J. Haung F. Lum H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L972-L980Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the precipitated proteins or 10 μg of cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the residual binding sites on the filters were blocked by incubating with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were subsequently incubated with the indicated antibodies and developed using an enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL) method as described (36Minhajuddin M. Fazal F. Bijli K.M. Amin M.R. Rahman A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5823-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde/PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature as described (38Fazal F. Gu L. Ihnatovych I. Han Y. Hu W. Antic N. Carreira F. Blomquist J.F. Hope T.J. Ucker D.S. de Lanerolle P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6259-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS and incubated in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin/PBS) for 30 min at room temperature to remove nonspecific binding of the antibody. All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature and cells were rinsed 3 times in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS between each of the steps. To localize F-actin filaments, cells were incubated with Alexa 488-phalloidin for 20 min at room temperature in a humid chamber. RelA/p65 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-RelA/p65 antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). DNA was stained using Hoechst Dye in PBS to visualize nuclei. The coverslips were rinsed in PBS and mounted on the slide using Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Lincolnshire, IL). Images were obtained using fluorescence or an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss axioplasm). Phalloidin staining was quantified using custom image processing routines written in MATLAB (Mathworks, Cambridge, MA). The routines use edge detection techniques to automatically identify cell boundaries, remove background fluorescence, and calculate the fluorescence for each cell. Averages and standard errors were computed over 3 or more images per condition for a minimum of 70 cells per condition. Reporter Gene Constructs, Endothelial Cell Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—The plasmid pNF-κB-LUC containing 5 copies of consensus NF-κB sequences linked to a minimal E1B promoter-luciferase gene was purchased from Stratagene. Transfections were performed using the DEAE-dextran method (39Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) with slight modifications (22Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Uddin S. Xu N. Ye R.D. Platanias L.C. Malik A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5554-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of DNA was mixed with 50 μg/ml DEAE-dextran in serum-free endothelial basal medium 2 and the mixture was added onto cells that were 60–80% confluent. We used 0.125 μg of pTKRLUC plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) containing Renilla luciferase gene driven by the constitutively active thymidine kinase promoter to normalize transfection efficiencies. After 1 h, cells were incubated for 4 min with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in serum-free endothelial basal medium 2. The cells were then washed 2 times with endothelial basal medium 2, 10% FBS and grown to confluence. We achieved transfection efficiency of 16 ± 3 (mean ± S.D.; n = 3) in these cells. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Promega Biotech Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System. The data were expressed as a ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity. Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extract Preparation—After treatments, cells were washed 2 times with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 15 min, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.6%. Samples were centrifuged to collect the supernatants containing cytosolic proteins for determining IκBα degradation by Western blot analysis. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 30 min at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged and supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were transferred to new vials. Protein concentration of the extract was measured using a Bio-Rad protein determination kit (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (33Anwar K.N. Fazal F. Malik A.B. Rahman A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6965-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (20-μl final volume)) for 15 min at room temperature. Then end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a NF-κB site (30,000 cpm each) were added and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in low ionic strength buffer (0.25 × Tris borate/EDTA). The oligonucleotide used for the gel shift analysis was NF-κB 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ or ICAM-1 NF-κB 5′-AGCTTGGAAATTCCGGAGCTG-3′). The ICAM-1 NF-κB oligonucleotide represents a 21-bp sequence of ICAM-1 promoter encompassing the NF-κB binding site located 183 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site (40Hou J. Baichwal V. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11641-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The IgκB oligonucleotide contains the consensus NF-κB binding site sequence present in the mouse Igκ light chain gene (41Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The sequence motifs within the oligonucleotides are underlined. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between experimental groups were made by Student's t test. Differences in mean values were considered significant at p < 0.05. Stabilization and Destabilization of Actin Filaments Selectively Inhibits Thrombin-induced NF-κB Activity and ICAM-1 Expression in Endothelial Cells—To address the role of actin cytoskeleton in the mechanism of thrombin-induced NF-κB activation in endothelial cells, we first evaluated the effect of destabilizing the actin filaments on NF-κB-dependent reporter gene activity. We used cytochalasin D (Cyto D) and latrunculin B (Lat B), the prototypic actin depolymerizing agents (42Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar, 43Morton W.M. Ayscough K.R. McLaughlin P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), to prevent the formation of actin stress fibers induced by thrombin. Analysis by confocal microscopy of HUVEC stained with Alexa 488-labeled phalloidin revealed that thrombin induced the formation of actin stress fibers (F-actin) (Fig. 1A, panel b). Pretreatment of cells with Cyto D or Lat B prevented the formation of stress fibers induced by thrombin (Fig. 1A, panels c and d). We observed that the effect of Lat B on stress fiber formation was more pronounced than Cyto D (Fig. 1A, panels c and d), consistent with Lat B being more potent than Cyto D (43Morton W.M. Ayscough K.R. McLaughlin P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Using the same approach as described above, we determined the effect of destabilization of actin filaments on the NF-κB activity. We found that destabilizing the actin cytoskeleton inhibited thrombin-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 1B). In parallel experiments, we determined the ability of TNFα, the prototypic inducer of NF-κB activation, to induce stress fiber formation in endothelial cells. Results showed that TNFα failed to induce stress fiber formation comparable with thrombin (Fig. 1C, panel b versus c). We also found that destabilization of actin filaments failed to inhibit TNFα-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 1D). In view of our findings that the RhoA/ROCK pathway, a critical regulator of actin cytoskeleton (29Kawkitinarong K. Linz-McGillem L. Birukov K.G. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 6965-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we determined whether destabilization of the actin filaments also interferes with NF-κB-dependent reporter activity induced by RhoA. Expression of constitutively active RhoA mutant (RhoAcat) induced NF-κB activity in the absence of thrombin challenge. Exposure of cells to Lat B inhibited RhoAcat-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 1E). These data are consistent with selective regulation by RhoA and the actin cytoskeleton of thrombin-induced NF-κB activation in endothelial cells. In reciprocal experiments, we used jasplakinolide (Jas), the classic actin cytoskeleton stabilizing agent (44Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to assess the effect of stabilizing the actin filaments on NF-κB activity. Intriguingly, pretreatment of cells with Jas also prevented thrombin-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 2A), but had only a small effect on the TNFα response (Fig. 2B). Because NF-κB is an essential regulator of ICAM-1 transcription (21Rahman A. Anwar K.N. True A.L. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5466-5476PubMed Google Scholar), we determined if the effects of stabilization/destabilization of the actin filaments on NF-κB activity are reproduced on thrombin- and TNFα-induced ICAM-1 gene transcription in endothelial cells. Analysis by reverse transcriptase-PCR showed that destabilizing/stabilizing the actin filaments inhibited thrombin-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3, A and B). We also determined the effect of destabilizing/stabilizing the actin filaments on thrombin-induced ICAM-1 protein expression. Western blot analysis showed that thrombin challenge of HUVEC resulted in increased ICAM-1 protein expression and that this response was inhibited in cells pretreated with varying concentrations of Cyto D or Jas (Fig. 3, C and D). We observed that a low dose of 5 μm Cyto D or 1 μm Jas was sufficient to inhibit ICAM-1 protein expression by thrombin (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast, destabilizing/stabilizing the actin filaments failed to inhibit TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression even at higher concentrations of Cyto D (15 μm) and Jas (4 μm) (Fig. 4, A and B). The ineffectiveness of Jas and Cyto D in preventing TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression is consistent with the findings of Vandenberg et al. (45Vandenberg E. Reid M.D. Edwards J.D. Davis H.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 926-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4A and B, effects of stabilization and destabilization of actin filaments on TNFα-induced ICAM-1 protein expression. Confluent HUVEC monolayers were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of Cyto D(A) or Jas (B) and then challenged with 100 units/ml TNFα for 6 h. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted with an antibody to ICAM-1. Actin levels were used to monitor loading.

We first verified the identity of NF-κB complex activated by thrombin in endothelial cells. Electrophoretic mobility supershift assay showed that anti-RelA/p65 antibody produced a strong supershift (Fig. 5A), whereas anti-p50 antibody caused only a faint supershift (data not shown). These data confirm our previous observation that thrombin-induced NF-κB complexes are predominantly composed of RelA/p65 homodimer (21Rahman A. Anwar K.N. True A.L. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5466-5476PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, NF-κB complex activated by TNFα in endothelial cells is also predominantly composed of RelA/p65 homodimer (19Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In subsequent experiments, we found that destabilizing and stabilizing the actin filaments both reduced the DNA binding of RelA/p65 in response to thrombin challenge (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, TNFα-induced NF-κB DNA binding was refractory to stabilizing or destabilizing the actin filaments (Fig. 5, D and E). To address the possibility that the impaired DNA binding of RelA/p65 was due to inhibition of IκBα degradation, we examined the effect of stabilization/destabilization of the actin filaments on IκBα degradation induced by thrombin. Contrary to the expectation, stabilizing/destabilizing the actin filaments failed to prevent thrombin-induced IκBα degradation (Fig. 6, A and B).FIGURE 6Effects of stabilization and destabilization of actin filaments on thrombin-induced IκBα degradation. Confluent HUVEC monolayers were pretreated with 1 μm Lat B or 5 μm Cyto D (A) or 1 μm Jas (B) for 30 min prior to challenge with 5 units/ml thrombin for 1 h.

ALDH3A1 is a corneal crystallin, which is defined as a protein recruited into the cornea for structural purposes without losing its primary function (i.e. metabolism). Although the primary role of ALDH3A1 in the metabolism of toxic aldehydes has been clearly demonstrated, including the detoxification of aldehydes produced during UV-induced lipid peroxidation, the structural role of ALDH3A1 in the cornea remains elusive. We therefore examined the potential contribution of ALDH3A1 in maintaining the optical integrity of the cornea by suppressing the aggregation and/or inactivation of other proteins through chaperone-like activity and other protective mechanisms. We found that ALDH3A1 underwent a structural transition near physiological temperatures to form a partially unfolded conformation that is suggestive of chaperone activity. Although this structural transition alone did not correlate with any protection, ALDH3A1 substantially reduced the inactivation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and malondialdehyde when co-incubated with NADP+, reinforcing the importance of the metabolic function of this corneal enzyme in the detoxification of toxic aldehydes. A large excess of ALDH3A1 also protected glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from inactivation because of direct exposure to UVB light, which suggests that ALDH3A1 may shield other proteins from damaging UV rays. Collectively, these data demonstrate that ALDH3A1 can reduce protein inactivation and/or aggregation not only by detoxification of reactive aldehydes but also by directly absorbing UV energy. This study provides for the first time mechanistic evidence supporting the structural role of the corneal crystallin ALDH3A1 as a UV-absorbing constituent of the cornea.

This study provides for the first time mechanistic evidence supporting the structural role of the corneal crystallin ALDH3A1 as a UV-absorbing constituent of the cornea. The cornea is an avascular tissue located at the anterior portion of the eye and serves as the first defense against environmental stress to internal ocular tissues. ALDH3A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1), a major constituent in the corneal epithelium, plays a critical and multifunctional role against UV-induced oxidative stress in the cornea (1.Downes J.E.

Med. 2003; 34: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). ALDH3A1 has been found to represent from 5 to 50% of the water-soluble protein fraction in the mammalian corneal epithelium depending on the species (4.Pappa A. Sophos N.A. Vasiliou V. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5.Piatigorsky J. Cornea. 2001; 20: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6.Estey T. Piatigorsky J. Lassen N. Vasiliou V. Exp. Eye Res. 2007; 84: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ALDH3A1 is responsible for the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous aldehydes through NAD(P)+-dependent oxidation (7.Vasiliou V. Pappa A. Estey T. Drug Metab. Rev. 2004; 36: 279-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), including the detoxification of various aldehydes produced during UV-induced peroxidation of cellular lipids (8.King G. Holmes R. J. Exp. Zool. 1998; 282: 12-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Pappa A. Estey T. Manzer R. Brown D. Vasiliou V. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown previously that cells expressing high levels of ALDH3A1 are substantially more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis as well as apoptosis arising from exposure to 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), 2The abbreviations used are: 4-HNE, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; MDA, malondialdehyde; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; UVR, ultraviolet radiation; LDH, l-lactic dehydrogenase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SE-HPLC, size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography; 2DUV, second derivative ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy. one of the most cytotoxic aldehyde byproducts of lipid peroxidation (3.Pappa A. Chen C. Koutalos Y. Townsend A.J. Vasiliou V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Studies with recombinant human ALDH3A1 revealed that the enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of not only 4-HNE (Km ∼ 45 μm) but a variety of other aldehydes, including hexanal (Km ∼ 18 μm), benzaldehyde (Km ∼ 200 μm), and malondialdehyde (MDA; Km ∼ 6.6 mm) as well (9.Pappa A. Estey T. Manzer R. Brown D. Vasiliou V. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast to many of the other members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily of proteins, the broad range of substrate specificity suggests that ALDH3A1 is highly versatile in its metabolic properties and can detoxify a wide range of toxic aldehydic compounds (7.Vasiliou V. Pappa A. Estey T. Drug Metab. Rev. 2004; 36: 279-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). With levels of ALDH3A1 expression exceeding that needed for metabolism alone (10.Jester J.V. Moller-Pedersen T. Huang J. Sax C.M. Kays W.T. Cavangh H.D. Petroll W.M. Piatigorsky J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 613-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that ALDH3A1 plays additional roles in the cornea, including those related to its function as a corneal crystallin. With parallels to the lens crystallins, corneal crystallins represent a group of highly expressed corneal proteins that have been recruited to serve as structural elements without losing their primary function (5.Piatigorsky J. Cornea. 2001; 20: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11.Piatigorsky J. Cornea. 1998; 17: 145-174Google Scholar). In the case of ALDH3A1, the importance of primary function (i.e. metabolism) has been clearly demonstrated, whereas any structural role is speculative at best. Abedinia et al. (12.Abedinia M. Pain T. Algar E.M. Holmes R.S. Cornea. 1990; 51: 419-426Google Scholar) proposed that ALDH3A1 could directly absorb UV light and thereby protect other ocular elements from the deleterious effects of UVR, including protein and DNA damage. This was substantiated by the observation that the water-soluble fraction of the bovine cornea accounts for only 17% of the total protein but for nearly 50% of the total absorption of UV light (290–300 nm) (13.Mitchell J. Cenedella R.J. Cornea. 1995; 14: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Additionally, high concentrations of ALDH3A1 in the cornea may simply represent a target for damaging compounds, such as aldehydes and reactive oxygen species, so that other elements remain intact (14.Uma L. Hariharan J. Sharma Y. Balasubramanian D. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that ALDH3A1 may function as a chaperone to prevent non-native aggregation of damaged and/or inactivated proteins under conditions of oxidative stress (15.Uma L. Hariharan J. Sharma Y. Balasubramanian D. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16.Manzer R. Pappa A. Estey T. Sladek N. Carpenter J.F. Vasiliou V. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Not unlike α-crystallin in the lens, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the chaperone activity of ALDH3A1 could help to maintain the optical qualities of the cornea by reducing non-native protein aggregation. As the cornea is a transparent tissue, the accumulation of aggregated proteins could increase light scattering and negatively impact vision. Thus, ALDH3A1 may represent an important component in maintaining the structural integrity of the cornea. We therefore sought to investigate the potential of ALDH3A1 to protect other (i.e. target) proteins against non-native aggregation and/or inactivation in vitro through three different mechanisms related to chaperone activity as follows: the prevention of the thermally induced aggregation of target proteins, the reduction of aldehyde-induced inactivation, and the protection against UVR-induced damage. First, we examined the thermal stability of ALDH3A1 by far-UV CD as well as second derivative absorption spectroscopy (2DUV). We also evaluated the potential for ALDH3A1 to suppress the non-native aggregation of the target protein l-lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) during isothermal incubation studies. The UV- and aldehyde-induced inactivation of the target protein glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was then characterized by enzymatic and spectroscopic methods, followed by examining the ability of ALDH3A1 to protect against such damage. Materials−The following reagents of analytical grade were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich: sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, Tris-HCl, potassium and sodium phosphate (mono- and di-basic), sodium sulfate, sodium azide, NAD(P)+, β-mercaptoethanol, EDTA, Triton X-100, Tween 20 (polysorbate 20), glucose 6-phosphate, and 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane (MDA precursor). Bovine serum albumin, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and l-lactic dehydrogenase were also obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. 4-HNE was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). For affinity chromatography, 5′-AMP-Sepharose 4B was obtained from GE Healthcare. Mini dialysis units (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) and membranes (polyvinylidene difluoride and Amicon®) were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immuno-Research (West Grove, PA), and the reagents for chemiluminescence were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce. Coomassie Blue stain was obtained from Bio-Rad. Purification of ALDH3A1−ALDH3A1 was expressed in an insect cell line (Spodoptera frugiperda, Sf9) and purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (9.Pappa A. Estey T. Manzer R. Brown D. Vasiliou V. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17.Manzer R. Qamar L. Estey T. Pappa A. Petersen D.R. Vasiliou V. DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The cell pellets obtained from centrifugation of the Sf9 cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% Triton X-100) and sonicated on ice for 30 s followed by 30 s of rest for a total of six sonication cycles. To isolate the cytosolic fraction, the crude homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The cytosolic fraction was applied to a 5′-AMP-Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with binding buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Bound ALDH3A1 was eluted using an isocratic elution of 0.25 mm NAD+ in binding buffer. Purified protein was concentrated using an Amicon® device equipped with a 30-kDa cut-off membrane under N2 gas and dialyzed against a large volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl (pH 7.4). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein purity was estimated to be greater than 95% by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). Thermal Unfolding and Thermal Stability of ALDH3A1− Thermal unfolding of ALDH3A1 was monitored by far-UV CD using an AVIV model 62DS spectrometer equipped with Peltier thermal control. ALDH3A1 was prepared at 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl (pH 7.4) in a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette. The α-helix structural content of ALDH3A1 was followed at 222 nm as the sample was heated from 4 to 80 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. The resulting unfolding curve (fraction folded protein versus temperature), which was highly cooperative and fit to a two-state mechanism, was used to determine the apparent Tm as a consequence of the irreversible aggregation of the protein as described previously (18.Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 299-321Google Scholar). Additionally, ALDH3A1 aggregation arising from thermal stress was assessed by following the increase in light scattering of the protein solution at 350 nm as a function of temperature using a Hewlett-Packard 8543 UV-visible spectrophotometer. ALDH3A1 was prepared at 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl (pH 7.4) in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. The temperature was increased from 15 to 80 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min with a 2-min equilibration interval at each temperature step. Ultraviolet Absorbance Spectroscopy−Absorbance spectra of ALDH3A1 were collected as a function of temperature using a Hewlett-Packard UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. ALDH3A1 was prepared at 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl (pH 7.4) in a 200-μl quartz cuvette with a 1-cm path length cell. Absorbance scans were collected at 2 °C steps, with a 2-min equilibration time at each step, from 15 to 80 °C. Spectra were collected from 200–500 nm at 1-nm intervals using an integration time of 5 s. In some cases, the raw absorbance data were used to evaluate the turbidity of the solution at 350 nm. The absorbance data were transformed to second derivative spectra using Chemstation™ software as described previously (19.Kueltzo L.A. Ersoy B. Ralston J.P. Middaugh C.R. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 92: 1805-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD, 0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with either 4-HNE or MDA as described below. Immediately following the incubation, the excess 4-HNE or MDA was removed from the protein solution by dialysis against 100 mm KPO4 (pH 7.4) overnight at 4 °C using a mini dialysis unit following the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein solution (∼0.1 mg/ml) was transferred to a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette, and absorbance spectra were collected at 25 °C and transformed as described above. For UVB-exposed G6PD, the protein was irradiated at 0.1 mg/ml as described below, and absorbance data were collected immediately after exposure. Thermal Aggregation Assays with the Target Protein l-Lactic Dehydrogenase (LDH)−LDH was prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl (pH 7.4) at 0.5 mg/ml. Aggregation of LDH at 37 °C was monitored by light scattering at 350 nm using a DU-640 spectrophotometer with a circulating water bath. Temperature within the cells was confirmed using a type T thermocouple (Omega Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT). To evaluate the chaperone-like activity of ALDH3A1 under such conditions, LDH (0.5 mg/ml) was prepared with 0.1 and 0.25 mg/ml ALDH3A1 and the experiment repeated. ALDH3A1 was also incubated at 37 °C alone at both concentrations as a control. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Irradiation of G6PD with UVB Light−G6PD was prepared at 25 units/ml (0.1 mg/ml) or 5 units/ml (0.02 mg/ml) in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and irradiated in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette with UVB light (295 nm) at 37 °C with gentle stirring using an AVIV spectrofluorometer. The photon flux of light incident on the sample during irradiation was determined to be 1014 photons/s by ferrioxalate actinometry (20.Murov S.L. Carmichael I. Hug G.L. Handbook of Photochemistry.2nd Ed. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1992: 298-305Google Scholar). Aliquots were removed from the solution at specific time points (0–30 min), placed on ice, and immediately assayed for G6PD enzymatic activity or subjected to other analyses. The experiment was repeated in the absence of the UVB light source for a dark control at each time point. The inactivation of G6PD by UVB light was also investigated in the presence of ALDH3A1 at 0.1 mg/ml (5-fold ratio) and 1.0 mg/ml (50-fold ratio) as well as bovine serum albumin (BSA) at the same concentrations. All experiments were performed in triplicate. G6PD Incubation with 4-HNE and MDA−G6PD was prepared at 25 or 5 units/ml in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and exposed to various concentrations of 4-HNE up to 2 mm for 2 h at 37°C. Samples were removed from the incubator, placed on ice, and immediately assayed for G6PD enzymatic activity or subjected to other analyses are described below. Controls were also performed in which G6PD was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h without 4-HNE. The inactivation of G6PD was repeated in the presence of a 10-fold excess of ALDH3A1 (0.2 mg/ml), 1 mm NADP+, and both a 10-fold excess of ALDH3A1 and 1 mm NADP+. Additionally, G6PD inactivation studies were also performed in the presence of 10-fold BSA. For MDA inactivation studies, MDA was first synthesized following the method described by Esterbauer et al. (21.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5902) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane was acidified with 1 n HCl and dissolved under mild heating. The reaction was quenched with a large volume of 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and stored on ice and under foil. The concentration of the MDA stock solution was determined spectrophotometrically at 266 nm (ε = 31,500 m–1 cm–1). MDA was synthesized fresh daily. G6PD inactivation experiments with MDA were performed in a similar manner as described for 4-HNE above. G6PD Enzymatic Activity Assay−The enzymatic activity of G6PD was determined by monitoring the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at 25 °C. Reactions were performed in a 1-ml quartz cuvette with a 1-cm path length. For each assay, ∼0.2 μg of G6PD was added into reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0) that contained 2.5 mm NADP+. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of glucose 6-phosphate substrate. The linear portion of the reaction rates were fit to a linear slope and expressed as a specific activity with units of nmol of NADPH/min/mg of protein. The loss of G6PD enzyme activity because of UV light, 4-HNE, and MDA was expressed as a percent of the respective control and the data used to generate inactivation curves. UVB-induced inactivation curves were fit to a simple exponential decay model using SigmaPlot software, which allowed for the calculation of the exposure time (min) required to reduce the activity of G6PD to 50% of the control. For 4-HNE-incubated protein, inactivation curves were fit to a 3-parameter sigmoid curve using SigmaPlot software to calculate the IC50 value (concentration at which 50% of the protein is inactivated). MDA inactivation curves were fit to a simple exponential decay model using SigmaPlot software to calculate the IC50 value. Size Exclusion High Performance Liquid Chromatography (SE-HPLC) Analysis of G6PD−A Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC (250-μl injection syringe and diode array UV detection), equipped with a TSK-Gel 2000SWXL column (Tosoh Biosciences LLC, Montgomeryville, PA), was used for SE-HPLC analysis. The mobile phase was 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 100 mm sodium sulfate, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide (22.Kumar M.S. Reddy P.Y. Sreedhar B. Reddy G.B. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which was filtered and de-gassed prior to use. Protein samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g) prior to analysis to remove insoluble material. The flow rate during analysis was 0.6 ml/min, and protein was detected at 220 nm. G6PD (0.1 mg/ml) was treated with 4-HNE and MDA or exposed to UVB light as described above, and samples were analyzed immediately after treatment. To quantify loss in soluble G6PD, chromatogram peak areas were determined by integration using Chemstation™ software. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis−G6PD (0.1 mg/ml) was treated with 4-HNE and MDA or exposed to UVB light as described above. Protein samples containing up to 0.5 μg of G6PD (for Western blot) or 10 μg of G6PD (for Coomassie Blue staining) were electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue stain or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blotting. Western blot membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20). The membranes were then probed with an anti-4-HNE antibody at 1:500 (kindly provided by Dr. Dennis Petersen, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver) for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk/TBST. Following substantial washing in TBST, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied for 30 min at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk/TBST followed by washing in TBST. Protein bands were then visualized using by chemiluminescence. Thermal Unfolding and Thermal Stability of ALDH3A1− The chaperone activity of α-crystallin in the lens has been shown to be influenced by temperature, which may be related to temperature-induced structural transitions that accommodate interactions with other partially unfolded protein molecules (23.Koteiche H.A. McHaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10361-10367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24.Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23559-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We therefore first characterized the effect of temperature on the conformation of ALDH3A1 using far-UV CD, turbidity measurements, and 2DUV spectroscopy. The thermal unfolding of ALDH3A1 secondary structure was followed by the intensity of the 222 nm band (α-helix structure) in the far-UV CD spectrum as a function of temperature. Analysis of the unfolding curve (Fig. 1A) revealed that ALDH3A1 lost native secondary structure at temperatures greater than 50 °C, and the apparent Tm was estimated to be 57.2 C ± 0.7 °C. We also monitored the thermal aggregation of ALDH3A1 by measuring the turbidity of the solution at 350 nm. We observed the onset of ALDH3A1 aggregation at ∼43 °C followed by substantial aggregation and precipitation of the protein (Fig. 1B). At temperatures above 50 °C, ALDH3A1 formed insoluble protein aggregates that settled at the bottom of the cuvette. The effect of temperature on the tertiary structure of ALDH3A1 was also examined using 2DUV, which revealed blue shifts in three peak positions as a function of temperature (Fig. 2A). Closer examination of these transitions show that the peak positions corresponding to Trp (Fig. 2B), both Trp and Tyr (Fig. 2C), and to Phe (Fig. 2D) residues became blue-shifted at temperatures as low as 32 °C. We also found that at physiological temperature (37 °C), all three peak positions were substantially blue-shifted when compared with peak positions at 15 °C. Because the peak position correlates with the polarity of the local environment of the residues, the observed blue shifts are indicative of movement of the affected residues to a more polar environment likely because of an increase in solvent exposure (25.Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, the tertiary structure of ALDH3A1 is partially unfolded at physiologically relevant temperatures.FIGURE 2Second derivative absorbance spectra of ALDH3A1 as a function of temperature. A, ALDH3A1 was prepared at 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl (pH 7.4), and data were collected at 15 °C (solid line), 25 °C (dotted line), 37 °C (dashed line), and 43 °C (dot-dashed line). Trends in the change in peak positions are indicated by arrows. Each spectrum is an average of three individual samples.

(n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thermal Aggregation Assays with LDH−The ability of ALDH3A1 to suppress the thermal aggregation of other proteins was investigated with the target protein LDH. LDH aggregates under physiological conditions (37 °C) (26.Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), thus making it a suitable target protein to test the chaperone activity of ALDH3A1, which adopts a partially unfolded structure at this temperature (Fig. 2). We detected an increase in the light scattering of the LDH solution (0.5 mg/ml) at 350 nm during incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 3), indicating that this target protein has formed large, insoluble aggregates. Co-incubation of LDH with 0.1 mg/ml ALDH3A1 produced unexpected results; the addition of ALDH3A1 to the LDH solution resulted in a greater extent of light scattering than observed with LDH alone. This trend was further demonstrated by the addition of 0.25 mg/ml ALDH3A1 to the LDH incubation solution, which led to rapid and substantial solution turbidity. In contrast, incubation of ALDH3A1 alone at these two concentrations produced negligible increases in light scattering during the incubation period. Characterization of UVB-induced Changes to G6PD−UVR is a considerable source of oxidative stress for the corneal epithelium because this cell layer absorbs the majority of all UV wavelengths (27.Zigman S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28.Pitts D.G. Pitts D.G. Kleinstein R.N. Environmental Vision. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1993: 2-45Google Scholar). G6PD (0.1 mg/ml) was irradiated with UVB light at a representative wavelength of 295 nm at 37 °C. We found that UVB exposure led to the inactivation of G6PD as seen by the loss of specific enzyme activity (Fig. 4A). We did not detect any changes in G6PD molecular weight (i.e. cross-linking) by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B), and UVB light did not induce any soluble or insoluble aggregation of G6PD by SE-HPLC or turbidity measurements (data not shown). 2DUV analysis, however, showed a small blue shift in Trp residues because of UVB exposure (Fig. 4C), suggesting that exposure to UVB light results in a slight unfolding of G6PD tertiary structure. ALDH3A1 Protects G6PD against UVB-induced Inactivation−The UVB-induced inactivation of G6PD (5 units/ml) at 37 °C was reduced when carried out in the presence of an excess of ALDH3A1 (Fig. 5A). In addition, the extent of protection was proportional to the ALDH3A1 concentration during the irradiation experiments. We found that a 5-fold mass excess of ALDH3A1 afforded a small amount of protection against UVB-induced inactivation whereas a 50-fold mass excess of ALDH3A1 more than doubled the amount of UVB exposure time needed to reduce G6PD activity to 50% of the control (Table 1). To evaluate whether the observed protection is specific to ALDH3A1, the experiments were repeated using BSA as a control protein (29.Ganea E. Harding J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) at the same excess ratios. BSA provided a similar extent of protection against UVB-induced inactivation (Fig. 5B; Table 1).TABLE 1Inactivation of G6PD by UVB light at 37 °CSample compositionExposure time (min) to reduce activity by 50%aUVB exposure time needed to reduce the activity of G6PD by 50% was calculated using the inactivation curves shown in Fig. 5, A and B.

The classical human C5a receptor (C5aR) preferentially binds C5a, with a 10–100-fold lower affinity for C5a des Arg. In contrast, C5L2 binds both ligands with nearly equal affinity. C5aR presents acidic and tyrosine residues in its N terminus that interact with the core of C5a while a hydrophobic pocket formed by the transmembrane helices interacts with residues in the C terminus of C5a. Here, we have investigated the molecular basis for the increased affinity of C5L2 for C5a des Arg. Rat and mouse C5L2 preferentially bound C5a des Arg, whereas rodent C5aR showed much higher affinity for intact C5a. Effective peptidic and non-peptidic ligands for the transmembrane hydrophobic pocket of C5aR were poor inhibitors of ligand binding to C5L2. An antibody raised against the N terminus of human C5L2 did not affect the binding of C5a to C5L2 but did inhibit C5a des Arg binding. A chimeric C5L2, containing the N terminus of C5aR, had little effect on the affinity for C5a des Arg. Mutation of acidic and tyrosine residues in the N terminus of human C5L2 revealed that 3 residues were critical for C5a des Arg binding but had little involvement in C5a binding. C5L2 thus appears to bind C5a and C5a des Arg by different mechanisms, and, unlike C5aR, C5L2 uses critical residues in its N-terminal domain for binding only to C5a des Arg.

Complement fragment 5a (C5a) is a 74-residue polypeptide that is a multifunctional proinflammatory mediator that causes leukocyte chemoattraction and degranulation, increases vascular permeability, and stimulates cytokine secretion (1Guo R.F.

Lett. 1999; 67: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the appropriate receptor (50,000/well of a 96-well microtiter plate) were incubated with the stated concentrations of His6-tagged C5a or C5a des Arg for 30 min at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% (w/v) NaN3 and then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound ligand. Anti-His6 antibody (mouse IgG; Qiagen) was added (50 μl at 2 μg/ml) and incubated with the cells for 30 min at 4 °C. After a further wash in phosphate-buffered saline, 50 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was used to detect bound ligand using a FACSsort flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Binding was calculated as the percentage of positive cells, i.e. with a fluorescent intensity higher than control cells measured in the absence of ligand. Receptor affinities are reported as EC50 values, calculated by non-linear regression analyses using GraphPad Prism v4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).RESULTSRodent C5L2 Homologs Are Primarily C5a des Arg-binding Proteins—Although human C5L2 has been well characterized, ligand binding by rodent C5L2 has not previously been reported. Rat, mouse, and human C5aR and C5L2 were expressed in CHO cells (except for mouse C5aR, which was expressed in RBL cells), and high expressing cell populations were produced either by cell sorting or by cloning. His6-tagged human, rat, and mouse C5a and C5a des Arg at a high, intermediate, or low dose (5000, 50, 5 nm) determined by the previously reported ligand binding affinities of hC5L2 (15Cain S.A.

Surface-bound ligand was then detected by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-His6 monoclonal antibody. This method measures only the ligand that remains bound after ∼1.5 h (i.e. that has a slow off-rate) and so C5a des Arg binding to C5aR, for example, appears quite low (Fig. 1) and no binding of human C3a or C3a des Arg to human C5L2 can be detected (data not shown). However, the EC50 values for hC5a binding to both hC5L2 (∼7nm) and hC5aR (∼4nm) (Table 1) are in close agreement with previously published binding affinities obtained using radiolabeled ligands, ∼3nm for both receptors (16Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M. Krause J.E. Choe H.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9406-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Similarly, hC5a des Arg binding to hC5L2 and hC5aR produced EC50 values of ∼36 and ∼527 nm (Table 3), again not dissimilar to affinity values obtained indirectly using radio competition assays, (∼12 and ∼660 nm, respectively) (16Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M. Krause J.E. Choe H.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9406-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, the ligand binding assay employed here is a valid quantitative method for the analysis of receptor affinities, with the advantage that it does not require chemical modification of the ligand and so is used here to facilitate the comparison of ligand binding to receptors from different species.TABLE 1The binding of C5a and C5a des Arg to C5L2 mutated at N-terminal acidic residuesReceptor LigandWTE9AD12AD15AD18AD22AD25AEC50aEC50, concentration (nm) resulting in 50% of the maximum binding.PEC50bpEC50, —log10EC50.ncn, number of separate experiments performed in duplicate.EC50pEC50nEC50pEC50nEC50pEC50nEC50pEC50nEC50pEC50nEC50pEC50nC5a6.928.16 ± 0.05183.108.51 ± 0.08**49.378.03 ± 0.08ns67.108.15 ± 0.09ns43.888.41 ± 0.10*422.97.64 ± 0.08***42.598.59 ± 0.14**4C5a desArg36.07.44 ± 0.071894.57.02 ± 0.12*44036.40 ± 0.13***62526.60 ± 0.10***448.67.31 ± 0.07ns4-<3433.47.48 ± 0.15ns4a EC50, concentration (nm) resulting in 50% of the maximum binding.b pEC50, —log10EC50.c n, number of separate experiments performed in duplicate.

Open table in a new tab It can be seen that C5L2 of all three species has an equal or higher affinity (or slower off-rate) for C5a des Arg compared with C5a. For the rodent species in particular, the lower levels of C5a binding suggest that C5L2 is primarily a C5a des Arg-binding protein, with a much lower propensity to bind or retain C5a. Mouse C5L2 is still saturated at 5 nm mC5a des Arg, whereas the binding of 5 nm mC5a is <50% maximal. When the affinity of mC5L2 was determined more carefully, using a wider range of ligand concentrations, the affinity for mC5a was >4000-fold lower than mC5a des Arg (data not shown). This is in contrast to mC5aR, which clearly shows a preference for mC5a over mC5a des Arg (Fig. 1). For rat C5L2, the difference is also marked, with the binding of 5 nm rC5a reduced to almost undetectable levels but 5 nm rC5a des Arg still at near-maximal binding (Fig. 1). The species of C5a/C5a des Arg used also appears to show differences between C5L2 and C5aR. Human C5L2 appears to show promiscuous binding with little preference for same species ligands, whereas human C5aR shows a higher degree of discrimination. Mouse and rat C5L2, in contrast, bind human C5a and C5a des Arg only weakly but show a clear preference for C5a des Arg over C5a (Fig. 1).A Panel of Synthetic Analogs of the C-terminal of C5a Are More Potent Inhibitors at C5aR than at C5L2—For C5aR, the full agonist potential of C5a is vested in only the C-terminal decapeptide of C5a, which binds in the transmembrane binding pocket. We have used a panel of peptidic and non-peptidic analogs of the C5a C terminus to compare the characteristics of the transmembrane binding pockets of C5L2 and C5aR. All the analogs were capable of blocking the binding of 50 nm His6-hC5a to hC5aR at statistically significant levels (Fig. 2A): F-[OP(DCha)WR], YSFKPMPLaR, FKP(DCha)Cha(D-R)-CO2H, FKP(DCha)Cha(D-R)-CONH2, 73, 74, 3261, 3257 (all 100 μm), W-54011 and YFKAChaChaL(D-F)R (both 10 μm because of limited solubility and toxicity, respectively). In contrast, these inhibitors had very weak effects on His6-hC5a binding to hC5L2 (Fig. 2B), and only 3257, 3261, and FKPDChaChaD-R-CONH2 inhibited binding to a significant extent. 3257, 3261, FKPDChaChaD-R-CO2H, and FKPDChaChaD-R-CONH2 could partly inhibit His6-hC5a des Arg binding to hC5L2 (Fig. 2C). The analogs were all ineffective at mC5L2, although only mC5a des Arg binding was measured as mC5a binding levels were too low for accurate assessment of inhibition (Fig. 2D). Thus, despite the conservation of many of the same residues, ligand binding to the transmembrane binding pockets of C5aR and C5L2 is clearly different.FIGURE 2The binding of analogs of the C terminus of C5a to human C5L2 and C5aR. CHO cells transfected with either human C5aR (A) human C5L2 (B, C), or mouse C5L2 (D) were preincubated with high doses (YFKAChaChaLD-FR, W-54011 10 μm, remainder 100 μm) of C5a analogs for 15 min and then incubated for 30 min with 50 nm His6-tagged human C5a (A, B), human C5a des Arg (C), or mouse C5a des Arg (D) and bound ligand quantified by indirect immunofluorescence, expressed as percent of binding to cells in the absence of analogs. The bars are means ± S.E. of four to seven separate experiments performed in duplicate.

The affinity-purified anti-serum was preincubated at 0.28 mg/ml with hC5L2 before the binding affinity for C5L2 ligands was measured. For hC5L2, the high affinity binding of His6-hC5a was not affected at all by antibody pretreatment (p = 0.62, Student t test) but the affinity for hC5a des Arg was decreased by more than 370-fold (pEC50 values significantly different, p = 0.0006) (Fig. 3. The lack of an effect on hC5a binding suggests that the antibody is blocking binding of C5a des Arg by a specific mechanism, possibly by hindering access to key residues in the N-terminal domain of C5L2.FIGURE 3The effects of an antibody against the N terminus of human C5L2 on ligand binding. CHO cells transfected with human C5L2 were preincubated with phosphate-buffered saline (filled symbols) or 0.28 mg/ml of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (open symbols) raised against the N terminus of human C5L2 for 15 min and then incubated for 30 min with His6-tagged human C5a (squares) or C5a des Arg (triangles).

The role of the N-terminal domain was further investigated by making a chimeric form of hC5L2 with the N terminus of hC5aR, substituting residues 1–32 (hC5L2) with 1–37 (hC5aR). After transfection and selection of CHO cells expressing similar levels of receptors, the binding affinity of His6-hC5a and hC5a des Arg was measured (Fig. 4). The affinity of the chimeric receptor, C5aRNC5L2, for hC5a was changed only slightly (<2-fold change relative to both parental receptors). Interestingly, hC5a des Arg binding was also unaffected; the affinity of C5aRNC5L2 was not significantly decreased (<2-fold) relative to hC5L2 although it was clearly higher than the affinity for C5aR (>15-fold). This finding suggests that the N terminus is not the only determinant of the high affinity of hC5L2 for hC5a des Arg.FIGURE 4The binding of C5a and C5a des Arg to human C5L2, C5aR, and an N-terminal chimera. CHO cells transfected with human C5L2, C5aR, and a chimera of human C5L2 with the N-terminal domain of C5aR (C5aRNC5L2) were incubated for 30 min with His6-tagged C5a (A) or C5a des Arg (B) and bound ligand quantified by indirect immunofluorescence, expressed as percent of binding to cells in the absence of analogs.

The affinity for hC5a was either unchanged or actually increased in all cases except D22A, where affinity decreased by ∼8-fold.

https://openalex.org/W2030815783,"Growth factor-dependent tissue remodeling, such as restenosis, is believed to be predominantly regulated by changes in expression of receptor-tyrosine-kinases (RTKs) and their ligands. As endogenous antagonists of RTKs, protein-tyrosine-phosphatases (PTPs) are additional candidate regulators of these processes. Using laser-capture-microdissection and quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we investigated the layer-specific expression of the four platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms, the PDGF-alpha and beta receptors, and five PTPs implied in control of PDGF-receptor signaling 8 and 14 days after balloon injury of the rat carotid. Results were correlated with analyses of PDGF-beta receptor phosphorylation and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation in vivo. The expression levels of all components, as well as receptor activation and VSMC proliferation, showed specific changes, which varied between media and neointima. Interestingly, PTP expression--particularly, DEP-1 levels--appeared to be the dominating factor determining receptor-phosphorylation and VSMC proliferation. In support of these findings, cultured DEP-1(-/-) cells displayed increased PDGF-dependent cell signaling. Hyperactivation of PDGF-induced signaling was also observed after siRNA-down-regulation of DEP-1 in VSMCs. The results indicate a previously unrecognized role of PDGF-receptor-targeting PTPs in controlling neointima formation. In more general terms, the observations indicate transcriptional regulation of PTPs as an important mechanism for controlling onset and termination of RTK-dependent tissue remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2023771155,"Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity is implicated in pathogenesis of central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS-TB). IFNgamma, a key cytokine in TB, usually inhibits MMP-9 secretion. Addition of IFNgamma to conditioned media from M. tb-infected monocytes (CoMTB) resulted in a 7-fold increase in MMP-9 activity detected by gelatin zymography (P<0.01). In contrast, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and -2 secretion, measured by ELISA, was suppressed. Dexamethasone abolished the synergistic increase in MMP-9 activity. Interleukin (IL)-1beta in CoMTB is a critical mediator of synergy with IFNgamma, and IL-1beta alone synergizes with IFNgamma to increase MMP-9 secretion from 51 +/- 31 to 762 +/- 136 U. IL-1beta activity is dependent on p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) kinase, which was found to be phosphorylated in tissue specimens from patients with CNS-TB. Extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk) and p38 MAPK activation did not affect IFNgamma signaling pathways. Inhibition of janus-activated kinase (JAK)-2 by 50 microM AG540 decreased MMP-9 secretion to 124 +/- 11.1 from 651 +/- 229 U of activity (P<0.01). However, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 but not STAT-1 phosphorylation was synergistically up-regulated by IFNgamma and CoMTB. In summary, synergy between IL-1beta and STAT-3 dependent IFNgamma signaling is key in control of up-regulation of MMP-9 activity in CNS-TB and may be a significant mechanism of brain tissue destruction."

Leukotriene B4 receptor type 1 (BLT1) is a high affinity G-protein-coupled receptors for leukotriene B4 functioning in host defense, inflammation, and immunity. Previous studies have shown that BLT1 utilizes different G-proteins (the Gi family and G16 G-proteins) in mediating diverse cellular events and that truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of BLT1 does not impair activation of Gi and G16 proteins. To determine responsive regions of BLT1 for G-protein coupling, we performed an extensive mutagenesis study of its intracellular loops. Three intracellular loops (i1, i2, and i3) of BLT1 were found to be important for both Gi and G16 coupling, as judged by Gi-dependent guanosine 5′-(γ-thio) triphosphate (GTPγS) binding and G16-dependent inositol phosphate accumulation assays. The i3-1 mutant, with a mutation at the i3 amino terminus, exhibited greatly reduced GTPγS binding but intact inositol phosphate accumulation triggered by leukotriene B4 stimulation. These results suggest that the i3-1 region is required only for Gi activation. Moreover, in the i3-1 mutant, the deficiency in Gi activation was accompanied by a loss of the high affinity leukotriene B4 binding state seen with the wild type receptor. A three-dimensional model of BLT1 constructed based on the structure of bovine rhodopsin suggests that the i3-1 region may consist of the cytoplasmic end of the transmembrane helix V, which protrudes the helix into the cytoplasm.

The molecular determinants of many receptors participating in G-protein coupling and activation have been investigated. With some exceptions, most of these studies emphasize the role of membrane-proximal regions of the second and third intracellular loops and of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor (17Hermans E.

We and others have reported that truncation of its cytoplasmic tail does not impair the ability of BLT1 to activate G-proteins (18Gaudreau R. Beaulieu M.E. Chen Z. Le Gouill C. Lavigne P. Stankova J.

To identify regions of BLT1 responsible for G-protein coupling, we performed an extensive mutagenesis study of its intracellular domains. Here, we show that BLT1 distinguishes Gi from G16 at the amino terminus of the third intracellular region (the i3-1 region). Furthermore, Scatchard analyses of the i3-1 mutant revealed that BLT1 requires Gi coupling to maintain a high affinity state for LTB4. A three-dimensional model of BLT1 suggested that the i3-1 region might localize to the cytoplasmic end of the transmembrane helix V. This region is suggested to form an extended helical structure proximate to the membrane, which projects toward the cytoplasm in order to interact with Gi.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Flow Cytometry—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma), each containing 10% fatal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. These cells were transfected with a wild type (WT) or mutated BLT1 expression vector using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For staining, cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody (3F10; 2 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% goatserum at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by staining with 10 μg/ml Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells highly expressing WT and mutant BLT1 were collected as polyclonal populations by cell sorting using an EPICS ALTRA (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL) and maintained in 0.3 mg/ml G418 (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Monoclonal cell lines were established by the limiting dilution method. EPICS XL (Beckman Coulter) was used for flow cytometry. Membrane Preparation and Western Blotting—Two or 3 days after transfection or after cells were grown to subconfluence, cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA. In some experiments, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PTX (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) for 12 h. Cells were disrupted in ice-cold sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 2mm EDTA) plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer and used as the membrane preparation. The protein concentration in each sample was determined by the Bradford method (Protein Assay Kit) (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were separated on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20), blots were probed with the primary antibody for 1 h. The membrane was washed with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h, and the signal was visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Ligand Binding Assay—The membrane preparation (10 or 5 μg of protein) was incubated in 100 μl of LTB4 binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA; fatty acid-free) and various concentrations of [3H]LTB4. To determine nonspecific binding, concentrations of unlabeled LTB4 at least 1,000 times higher than labeled were used. Mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by rapid filtration through GF/C filters and washing with ∼5ml of LTB4 binding buffer. Radioactivity was measured using a Top Count scintillation counter (Packard). GTPγS Binding Assay—The membrane preparation (10 μg of protein) was incubated in 100 μl of GTPγS binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, 1mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm GDP, and 0.1% BSA) containing 0.5 nm [35S]GTPγS with or without various concentrations of LTB4 for 30 min at 30 °C. To determine nonspecific binding, unlabeled GTPγS was added to the binding mixture to a final concentration of 10 μm. Bound [35S]GTPγS was separated from free by rapid filtration through GF/C filters and washed with ∼2 ml of ice-cold TMN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl). Radioactivity was measured as described above. cAMP Assay—CHO stable cells were plated at 3.2 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate. On the following day, cells were washed with buffer A (Hanks' balanced salt solution; Invitrogen) containing 0.1% BSA), pretreated with buffer A containing 0.5 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 15 min at room temperature, and then stimulated with a ligand solution (Buffer A, 0.5 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 50 μm forskolin) containing various concentrations of LTB4 for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of lysis buffer (Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 1% Tween 20). cAMP concentrations in the lysate were determined by an Alpha-Screen cAMP assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Inositol Phosphate (IP) Accumulation Assay—Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate and transfected with BLT1 and/or G-protein α subunit on the following day. Twenty-four hours later, culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences), followed by incubation for another 18-24 h. Cells were washed twice and preincubated for 10 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA and 10 mm LiCl, followed by stimulation with various concentrations of LTB4 or vehicle for 30 min. Stimulation was terminated by replacing the medium with ice-cold 5% HClO4 and incubating on ice for 2 h. Accumulated IP was purified by ion exchange chromatography (AG1-X8 resin; Bio-Rad), and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting (20Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S.

Chemotaxis Assay—Polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores (Neuro Probe Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min. The filter was placed in a 96-well Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe) containing LTB4 solution in the lower wells. CHO cells stably expressing WT or mutated BLT1 were placed at 6 × 104 cells/well in the upper wells. After incubating at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h, cells on the filter were fixed with methanol and stained using a Diff-Quik staining kit (International Reagents Corp., Kobe, Japan). The upper side of the filter was scraped free of cells. Then the number of cells migrating out to the lower side was determined by measuring optical densities at 595 nm using a 96-well microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed for statistical significance using analysis of variance using Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001, as indicated. BLT1 Structure Modeling Based on Rhodopsin Structure—A human BLT1 atomic model was constructed based on that of bovine rhodopsin with homology modeling as a rhodopsin subfamily member of GPCRs (22Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of seven transmembrane proteins were aligned according to the transmembrane sequence alignment in the GPCR data base (23Horn F. Vriend G. Cohen F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). O software (24Jones T.A. Thirup S. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) was used to replace amino acid residues according to the sequence alignment from bovine rhodopsin to BLT1 on the atomic model of the bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1F88) (22Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar). Finally, structural idealization with molecular dynamics using CNS software (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) was applied to the BLT1 model. The BLT1 model constructed was checked by Procheck software. All figures were prepared using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC, South San Francisco, CA). Mutagenesis—To determine regions of human BLT1 responsible for Gi and Gq protein activation, we performed extensive mutagenesis focusing on the intracellular loops. Three to four tandem amino acids in three regions (i1, i2, and i3) were replaced with alanines by PCR using HA-tagged human BLT1 as a template. We initially constructed 13 mutants designated i1-1 to i1-3, i2-1 to i2-5, and i3-1 to i3-5 (Fig. 1, A and B). Expression levels of these receptors on the cell surface were semiquantitatively analyzed by flow cytometry as follows. Cells transfected with WT BLT1 or mutants were stained with anti-HA antibody specific to the amino-terminal HA tag and Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. WT BLT1 and mutant receptors were expressed on the cell surface, judging from the increased means of fluorescence intensity of the WT BLT1 and mutants compared with the mock transfectant (Fig. 1C). BLT1/Gα Coupling—To determine which Gi protein subtypes couple to BLT1, we examined LTB4-induced GDP-GTP exchange of Gα by a GTPγS binding assay using membrane fractions of HEK293 cells transiently expressing BLT1 and various G-protein α subunits. Transfection of BLT1 without G-proteins caused only a slight increase above basal levels in GTPγS binding upon application of LTB4 (Fig. 2A). When BLT1 was co-transfected with members of the Gi family of G-protein α subunits, GTPγS binding activities were enhanced, whereas co-transfection of Gα16 did not show such an effect (data not shown). Co-transfected Gαi2 showed a significant increase in LTB4-induced GTPγS binding. Moreover, LTB4-induced GTPγS binding was completely abolished by pretreating the cells with PTX prior to membrane preparation (see Fig. 4A). These results suggest that measuring LTB4-induced GTPγS binding is an appropriate way to evaluate activation of PTX-sensitive Gi proteins by BLT1.FIGURE 4The i3-1 region functions only in Gi and not G16 signaling. A,[35S]GTPγS binding assay was performed with a membrane preparation from HEK293 cells transiently expressing Gαi2 and either WT BLT1 or the i3-1 mutant (mean ± S.D., n = 3). B, IP accumulation assay was performed using COS-7 cells transiently expressing Gα16 and either WT or mutant protein (mean ± S.D., n = 3). Data shown are representative of at least two separate experiments with similar results. c.p.m., counts/min; d.p.m., disintegrations/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The alanine mutants described above were expressed in HEK293 cells along with Gαi2 and evaluated for GDP-GTP exchange of Gα by the GTPγS binding assay. All mutants showed lower GTPγS binding than WT, but the i1-3, i2-4, i3-1, and i3-2 mutants exhibited significantly reduced GTPγS binding (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that all three regions, i1, i2, and i3, are crucial for Gi coupling. Next, to determine whether activation of the Gq family of G-proteins by mutant receptors is altered, we examined LTB4-induced total IP accumulation in COS-7 cells expressing both BLT1 and various Gα subunits. As reported by Gaudreau et al. (20Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), COS-7 cells expressing both BLT1 and Gα16 show significantly higher IP accumulation than cells expressing BLT1 alone (Fig. 3A). BLT1 mutants were co-expressed in COS-7 cells with Gα16 and tested for their ability to activate Gα16 by the IP accumulation assay Among the mutants that showed impaired GTPγS incorporation, only the i3-1 mutant displayed normal IP accumulation after ligand application (Fig. 3B). The i3-4 and i3-5 mutants exhibited higher IP accumulation than WT BLT1. Since these results suggested that the i3-1 region is responsible for Gi2 activation, we constructed another mutant in the more membrane-proximal region of the i3 loop (i3-0; Fig. 1B). As with the i3-1 mutant, the i3-0 mutant BLT1 showed normal IP accumulation but significantly reduced GTPγS binding after LTB4 application (Figs. 2B and 3B). These results show that the amino terminus of the i3 loop is important for Gi2 activation. Effects of the i3-1 Mutation on Gi2 and G16 Coupling—LTB4 stimulated an increase in GTPγS binding in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293 cells transfected with WT BLT1 and Gαi2, but no significant increases were seen with the i3-1 mutant (Fig. 4A). Increases in GTPγS binding mediated by LTB4 completely disappeared following pretreatment of cells with 100 ng/ml PTX. These results suggest that the i3-1 region functions in Gi2 activation. However, in LTB4-induced IP production, dose-response curves were similar between WT BLT1 and the i3-1 mutant in the presence of Gα16 in COS-7 cells, and PTX pretreatment did not affect IP accumulation (Fig. 4B). These results further support the idea that the i3-1 region of BLT1 leads to impairment in PTX-sensitive Gi2 activation without affecting PTX-resistant G16 signaling. To gain further insight into the role of the i3-1 region in signal transduction, we established polyclonal CHO cells stably expressing WT BLT1 or the i3-1 mutant. Cells highly expressing WT or the i3-1 mutant receptor were collected by cell sorting. The expression level of i3-1 mutant was similar to that of WT BLT1, as judged from flow cytometric and Western blotting analyses (Fig. 5, A and B). In CHO stable cells, the maximum response of GTPγS binding with the i3-1 mutant was only one quarter (23%) that of WT BLT1, although WT and the i3-1 mutant showed LTB4-induced GTPγS binding in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). The dose-response curve of LTB4 with the i3-1 mutant was shifted to the right from that seen with WT BLT1 (EC50;34 versus 5.0 nm) (Fig. 5, C and D). IC50 values of LTB4-induced adenylyl cyclase inhibition in cells expressing the i3-1 mutant and WT BLT1 receptors were 6.0 and 0.25 nm, respectively (Fig. 5E). It has been reported that GPCR-dependent chemotaxis requires activation of Gi and a resulting release of Gβγ dimers (26Arai H. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14495-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and that LTB4-induced chemotaxis is completely PTX-sensitive (7Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Although both WT and the i3-1 mutant BLT1 cells showed chemotactic responses to LTB4 with bell-shaped dose-response curves, cells expressing the i3-1 mutant showed impaired migration to low concentrations of LTB4 (Fig. 5F). However, IP accumulation in WT and the i3-1 mutant BLT1 cells transfected with Gα16 were comparable (Fig. 5G). These results confirm the presence of both impaired Gi activation and normal G16 activation by the i3-1 mutant in the same CHO stable cells. Effects of the i3-1 Mutation on [3H]LTB4 Binding—To examine the effect of the i3-1 mutation on ligand binding, we performed [3H]LTB4 binding experiments. Membrane preparations (10 μg of protein) from HEK293 cells transiently expressing WT BLT1 or the i3-1 mutant were incubated with various concentrations of [3H]LTB4 (Fig. 6A). From Scatchard analyses, WT BLT1 showed high affinity LTB4 binding with a Kd value of 3.5 nm and Bmax value of 2.1 pmol/mg protein (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the i3-1 mutant showed low affinity LTB4 binding with a Kd of 6.4 nm and a Bmax value of 1.8 pmol/mg protein. To analyze whether Gi coupling is required for high affinity LTB4 binding, we examined LTB4 binding of membrane preparations of PTX-treated cells. WT BLT1-expressing cells pretreated with PTX displayed only low affinity LTB4 binding similar to the i3-1 mutant (Fig. 6B). Experiments Using Monoclonal Cell Lines—In the above experiments, the Bmax of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the i3-1 mutant was lower than that in cells transfected with WT BLT1 (Fig. 6). To confirm that the defects in Gi signaling in the i3-1 mutant were not due to decreased expression of the mutant receptor, we established monoclonal cell lines of WT BLT1 (lines 10 and 13) and the i3-1 mutant (lines 30 and 46) and determined Bmax values and signaling (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, the LTB4 binding assay revealed that Bmax values for lines 10, 13, 30, and 46 of 8.1, 4.9, 7.6, and 14.4 pmol/mg protein, respectively. The Kd values were 1.9, 1.5, 7.4, and 8.3 nm, respectively. Dose-response curves of the i3-1 mutants (lines 30 and 46) were shifted to the right by 1 order of magnitude compared with WT BLT1 (lines 10 and 13; Fig. 7C). Although the i3-1 mutant 46 was expressed higher than the WT BLT1 (lines 10 and 13), the IC50 values of Gi-dependent adenylyl cyclase inhibition in the i3-1 mutant were higher than that in WT BLT1 (lines 10 and 13). However, a G16-dependent IP accumulation was similar among cells expressing either WT or mutant receptors (Fig. 7D). These results further confirm the impaired Gi activation and normal G16 activation. Using mutagenesis studies, we show that three intracellular loops of BLT1 function in G-protein activation (Figs. 2B and 3B). Among these regions, we identified the i3-1 region as a selective activation site for Gi protein. The i3-1 mutant showed impaired Gi activation but normal G16 activation (Figs. 4 and 7). The i3-1 region is located at the amino terminus of the third intracellular (i3) loop of BLT1. Previous reports suggest that the i3 region of several GPCRs functions in G-protein activation (27Natochin M. Gasimov K.G. Moussaif M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

The crystal structure of ferrous nitrosyl AXCP has previously revealed that NO is bound in an unprecedented manner on the proximal side of the heme. To understand how the protein structure of AXCP controls NO dynamics, we performed absorption and Raman time-resolved studies at the heme level as well as a molecular computational dynamics study at the entire protein structure level. We found that after NO dissociation from the heme iron, the structure of the proximal heme pocket of AXCP confines NO close to the iron so that an ultrafast (7 ps) and complete (99 ± 1%) geminate rebinding occurs, whereas the proximal histidine does not rebind to the heme iron on the timescale of NO geminate rebinding. The distal side controls the initial NO binding, whereas the proximal heme pocket controls its release. These dynamic properties allow the trapping of NO within the protein core and represent an extreme behavior observed among heme proteins.

Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a second messenger in several physiological systems (1.Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Cells have, thus, developed numerous heme proteins whose diverse functions involve nitric oxide binding and/or release. In some bacteria heme sensors were recently discovered (5.Nioche P. Berka V. Vipond J. Minton N. Tsai A.L. Raman C.S. Science. 2004; 306: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) with a femtomolar affinity for NO, whereas cytochromes c′ able to bind NO are found in many nitrogen-fixing, denitrifying, and photosynthetic bacteria (6.Romão M.J.

How heme proteins interact with NO and control its reactivity is ultimately related to their structure and the heme surroundings. A wide range of affinity and kinetic constants can be observed that correlates with the molecular dynamics of NO within the protein core. A striking example of this diversity is offered when comparing the NO dynamics governed by the enzyme NO synthase (9.Negrerie M. Berka V. Vos M.H. Liebl U. Lambry J.C. Tsai A.L. Martin J.L. J. Biol.

These latter proteins have an overall structure that presumably controls the strain upon the proximal histidine. Although sGC and AXCP possess different sequences and tertiary structures, they share the property that the binding of NO at the distal position of the heme leads to the cleavage of the proximal Fe2+-His bond and to the formation of 5c-NO complex. This so-called trans effect is due to a weakening of the axial Fe-His bond caused by the trans-coordination of NO and is governed by protein structure (15.Marti M.A. Capece L. Crespo A. Doctorovich F. Estrin D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 7721-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In 5c-NO species, the probability of fast NO rebinding after dissociation (either thermal or photo-induced) is increased (16.Negrerie M. Kruglik S.G. Lambry J.C. Vos M.H. Martin J.L. Franzen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10389-10398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and tends to a single phase as observed in sGC (10.Negrerie M. Bouzhir L. Martin J.L. Liebl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46815-46821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In sGC, the breaking of the proximal Fe-His bond in the resting state of the enzyme triggers the catalytic activity for cGMP production, whereas in AXCP the role of the proximal bond breaking and formation of a 5c-NO complex in a second order reaction (17.George S.J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) is not known. Unexpectedly, the crystal structure of AXCP (Fig. 1) has revealed that NO is bound to the proximal side of the ferrous heme replacing the endogenous His-120 ligand (14.Lawson D.M. Stevenson C.E.M. Andrew C.R. Eady R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5661-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19.Andrew C.R. Green E.L. Lawson D.M. Eady R.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4115-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The relation between this property not observed for other proteins and the function of AXCP should be crucial and remains to be established. In the present study we investigated how this unusual property of the novel proximal 5c-NO AXCP complex controls NO dynamics through its heme structural environment and how this can influence activity. We used jointly absorption and resonance Raman time-resolved spectroscopies to follow the dynamics of the dissociated 5c-NO transient complex on the picosecond timescale and have extended the spectroscopic results with molecular dynamics calculations on the entire protein level using the AXCP crystal structure. In these time-resolved spectroscopies, a femtosecond excitation pulse allows us to simulate the thermal dissociation of NO from the heme binding site, then to synchronously probe its interaction with the protein as a function of time. Overall, our results reveal that upon NO dissociation from the heme iron, the side chains within the proximal heme pocket of AXCP confine NO close to the heme so that immediate rebinding occurs. A very high proportion of NO (∼99%) is trapped, whereas the very minor population escaping does not rebind, likely because of the proximal His reattachment. This represents an extreme behavior observed among heme proteins. Preparation of the Samples−AXCP was purified as previously described (20.Ambler R.P. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21.Norris G.E. Anderson B.F. Baker E.N. Rumball S.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 135: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The protein was concentrated to 0.47 mm in heme in MES buffer (pH 6). Aliquots were kept frozen (-80 °C), thawed immediately before the spectroscopic measurements, and diluted to the working concentration. The solution of ferric AXCP (100 μl, 75 μm) was put in a 1-mm optical path length quartz cell sealed with a rubber stopper and degassed by means of four successive cycles of vacuum and purging with pure argon. The heme iron was reduced by the addition of 10 μl of degassed sodium ascorbate solution (5 mm final concentration). For preparing the NO-liganded AXCP, gas phase 10% NO diluted in N2 was directly introduced into the spectroscopic cell (∼200 μm NO in the aqueous phase). Equilibrium spectra were recorded at each step for monitoring the evolution of ligation. The absorbance of the sample was in the range 0.7-1 at the Soret maximum for 1-mm path length. Time-resolved Absorption Spectroscopy−Transient spectra were recorded simultaneously to kinetics as a time-wavelength matrix data using the pump-probe laser system previously described (22.Martin J.L. Vos M.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) for generating the broad spectral band probe pulse. The photodissociation of NO was achieved with an excitation pulse at 564 nm whose duration was ∼40 fs with a repetition rate of 30 Hz. The transient absorption spectrum after a variable delay between pump and probe pulses was recorded by means of a CCD detector. The same sample quartz cell (1-mm optical path length) was used for recording the equilibrium spectra and the transient absorption. The sample temperature was 18 °C during the measurements. The 20-ps time window was scanned with a 400-fs delay between two transient spectra and a dwell time of 2 s at each time point. Up to 40 scans were averaged. Global analysis of the data was performed by singular value decomposition (SVD) of the time-wavelength matrix (23.Negrerie M. Cianetti S. Vos M.H. Martin J.L. Kruglik S.G. J. Phys. Chem. B Condens. Matter Mater. Surf. Interfaces Biophys. 2006; 110: 12766-12781Google Scholar). The SVD component having the highest contribution corresponded to the geminate rebinding process, and its kinetics was fit to a minimum number of exponential components. Time-resolved Raman Spectroscopy−For subpicosecond Raman spectroscopy, we used a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser producing 50-fs pulses (λ = 810 nm) and amplified with a 1-kHz repetition rate (23.Negrerie M. Cianetti S. Vos M.H. Martin J.L. Kruglik S.G. J. Phys. Chem. B Condens. Matter Mater. Surf. Interfaces Biophys. 2006; 110: 12766-12781Google Scholar, 24.Cianetti S. Negrerie M. Vos M.H. Martin J.L. Kruglik S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13932-13933Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The output beam was frequency-doubled at 405 nm and then used to generate tunable pump and probe pulses by means of optical parametric generator, amplifiers, and frequency doubler, all based on barium borate crystals. The photodissociating pump pulse energy was about 2 μJ in the sample cell with a 100-fs duration and had a wavelength centered at 560 nm. Narrowband interference filters allowed us to obtain probe pulses at 420 nm and to achieve the best compromise between spectral (30 cm-1) and temporal (0.7 ps) resolutions in time-resolved Raman measurements. The probe pulse energy was 20-30 nJ in the sample cell. The pump and probe beams were collinearly superimposed and focused on the sample by a 10-cm lens, and the optical time delay between both pulses was controlled by a motorized translation stage. Raman scattering light was collected through a spectrograph (Jobin- Yvon) by a CCD detector (Roper Scientific). The sample (100 μl, 150 μm) was placed in a cylindrical spinning cell with a rubber stopper, vacuumed, and reduced with sodium ascorbate. The cell was filled with 10% NO gas diluted in nitrogen. The integrity and the coordination state of the sample were verified before and after the experiments by recording its absorption spectrum in anaerobic conditions. Structural Dynamics Simulation−To build the initial model we have used the structure of AXCP (Protein Data Bank code 1E85) in its reduced form bound to NO determined at 100 K and at 1.35 Å of resolution (14.Lawson D.M. Stevenson C.E.M. Andrew C.R. Eady R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5661-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this structure file of the monomer, NO appears liganded to the iron at the proximal side of the heme with two possible positions, and we used only the NO molecule labeled A in the file, which is not H-bonded to Arg-124. Because we took into account the H-bonds and van der Waals potential to calculate the dynamics, the choice of this particular starting position for NO does not influence the result. We built the dimer by means of the transform matrix attached to the Protein Data Bank file. The dimer model includes 408 water molecules from the x-ray structure, and we numerically added a shell of 1664 water molecules to take into account the solvent effects. The total electric charge of the model is 4 e- (pH 7.5). We added all hydrogen atoms, and the non-bonding interactions were gradually set to 0 between 8 and 13 Å. All the energy and dynamics calculations were performed by using the software CHARMM (25.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-212Crossref Scopus (14017) Google Scholar) using a HP J5600 work station. We started a dynamic trajectory on the built model structure by minimizing the total energy, and we obtained -28,181 kcal/mol. Then the structure was heated up to 300 K in 30 steps of 10 K for 30 ps (calculation and assignment of the speed of each atom every 1-ps step), and we allowed the equilibration of the kinetic energy over the entire structure at 300 K for 300 ps. Several 50-ps free dynamics steps were performed to obtain different initial structures for NO dissociation and are represented by the trajectory at negative time in Fig. 5. Then NO was dissociated by suppression of the bond between iron and NO. For dissociated NO, a three-charge model was used to calculate its interactions (26.Meuwly M. Becker O.M. Stote R. Karplus M. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 183-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The calculation was performed with an integration step of 1 fs, and all the structural and energy parameters were stored every ps. Transient Absorption Changes and Kinetics after NO Dissociation−The steady-state absorption spectra of unliganded and NO-liganded ferrous AXCP reveal the maximum of the Soret band located at 425 and 396 nm (Fig. 2A) characteristic of a 5-coordinate heme with histidine and nitric oxide, respectively, as axial ligands (18.Andrew C.R. George S.J. Lawson D.M. Eady R.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19.Andrew C.R. Green E.L. Lawson D.M. Eady R.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4115-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows the raw difference transient absorption spectra at various time delays after NO photodissociation from 5c-NO AXCP (40-fs time resolution). A bleaching centered at 392 nm, due to the disappearance of the 5c-NO AXCP, is seen immediately and simultaneously with an induced absorption centered at 416 nm. The intensity of the difference transient spectrum decayed without any shift of the maximum and minimum or of the isosbestic point, showing that only one process takes place until the spectra vanishes after 25 ps. The absorbance decay associated with geminate rebinding was fitted by global analysis to a mono-exponential function with a time constant of 7 ± 0.5 ps and an amplitude of 99 ± 1% (Fig. 2C). The introduction of a base line in the fit gave a value in the range 0.0-0.8% of the total amplitude and did not improve the fit. In Fig. 2D the pure transient spectral contribution decaying with the 7-ps time constant (trace c) was compared with the steady-state difference spectrum (5c-His minus 5c-NO AXCP; trace e) and also with the transient absorption spectrum after NO dissociation from myoglobin (trace m), which is in the 5c-His transient state. The pronounced difference between spectra in Fig. 2D indicates that the transient photodissociated AXCP species cannot have a 5-coordinate heme with the proximal His replacing NO since this latter species has maxima at 426-434 nm, whereas the transient AXCP species has a broad induced absorption centered at 416 nm (Fig. 2D). This position of the Soret-band maximum is apparently similar to that of 6c-NO-His AXCP in which NO binds at the distal side, in “trans” position to the endogenous His proximal ligand (18.Andrew C.R. George S.J. Lawson D.M. Eady R.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the global analysis of the absorption evolution reveals only one kinetic process. Thus, the transient species immediately formed and decaying mono-exponentially cannot be the 6c-NO-His AXCP because it would require the prior rebinding of His followed by the rebinding of NO and would lead to the presence of two kinetic phases that we did not observe. Therefore, the transient difference spectrum (trace c in Fig. 2D) associated with the 7-ps kinetics is assigned to the NO geminate rebinding process. The other SVD spectral components, accounting for ≤1% of the total amplitude, are within the noise level and cannot be assigned with certainty. Identification of the Transient Species by Time-resolved Raman Spectroscopy−To unambiguously identify the transient species, we recorded transient resonance Raman spectra at different time delays after NO photodissociation with 0.6-ps time resolution and a Raman probe (420 nm) close to the absorption maximum of the transient species induced by the dissociating pulse (560 nm). Fig. 3 presents the time-resolved resonance Raman (TR3) spectra of ferrous AXCP in the low-frequency spectral region. Spectrum a is a ground-state spectrum of the 5c-His species measured in a probe-only configuration. Spectrum b is the ground-state spectrum of 5c-NO AXCP, measured in a pump-and-probe configuration where the probe pulse arrived before the dissociating pump pulse (time delay Δt =-5 ps). Besides the decreased spectral resolution (30 cm-1) due to subpicosecond probe pulse duration, Raman spectra a and b in Fig. 3 closely correspond to the reported steady-state spectra recorded with continuous-wave probe (19.Andrew C.R. Green E.L. Lawson D.M. Eady R.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4115-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Spectra c-f in Fig. 3 are those of the pure transient photoproduct species at various time delays. They were obtained by weighted subtraction of the spectrum before dissociation (spectrum b) from the experimentally measured spectra. The details of such a subtraction procedure have been described elsewhere (23.Negrerie M. Cianetti S. Vos M.H. Martin J.L. Kruglik S.G. J. Phys. Chem. B Condens. Matter Mater. Surf. Interfaces Biophys. 2006; 110: 12766-12781Google Scholar, 27.Kruglik S.G. Mojzes P. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Turpin P.Y. J. Phys. Chem. B Condens. Matter Mater. Surf. Interfaces Biophys. 2001; 105: 5018-5031Google Scholar). The intense stretching vibration ν(Fe-His) at ∼233 cm-1 is active in 5c-His ferrous AXCP (spectrum a), whereas the stretching vibration ν(Fe-NO) at ∼525 cm-1, identified by isotopic substitution (19.Andrew C.R. Green E.L. Lawson D.M. Eady R.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4115-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), is active only in the 5c-NO AXCP (spectrum b). Because none of these bands is present in the photoproduct spectra (Fig. 3, c-f) and there is also no ν(Fe-NO) vibration at ∼579 cm-1 ascribed to 6c-NO-His AXCP (18.Andrew C.R. George S.J. Lawson D.M. Eady R.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we readily identify the transient species as a four-coordinate AXCP formed after NO photodissociation. These are the first Raman spectra reported for a four-coordinate photodissociated heme protein. Both absorption and Raman data indicate that the Fe-NO bond is photocleaved immediately, i.e. within the excitation pulse duration (<100 fs). The overall intensity of the transient spectra decreases so that the photoproduct Raman spectrum is rather weak at Δt =+10 ps, showing that the transient species rapidly reaches the initial 5c-NO state. The pattern of vibrational modes in the 300-500 cm-1 range is different for the transient form (c-f) compared with the spectra of the ground-state forms (a and b). This pattern contains heme skeletal vibrational modes and especially the δ(Cβ-Ca-Cb) and δ(Cβ-Ca-S) bending modes of thioether substituents participating in specific interactions of the c-type heme with the cysteine side chains. The evolution of their frequency and shift with time after NO detachment is indicative of a structural relaxation limited to the heme that is the direct consequence of the iron motion within the heme plane but does not lead to an overall structural rearrangement of the entire protein (Fig. 1B). The high frequency region of TR3 spectra of ferrous AXCP is presented in Fig. 4, in the same manner as in Fig. 3. The photoproduct spectra is neither that of equilibrium 5c-His AXCP (spectrum a) nor that of its 5c-NO adduct (spectrum b), therefore confirming its assignment to the four-coordinate transient species. The frequencies of the structure-sensitive (28.Abe M. Kitagawa T. Kyogoku Y. J. Chem. Phys. 1978; 69: 4526-4534Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 29.Spiro T.G. Li X.Y. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy.Vol. 3.

On the basis of these frequencies, we have calculated (29.Spiro T.G. Li X.Y. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy.Vol. 3.

We have also observed a change in intensity ratio of the oxidation state markers4 ν (1352-1373 cm-1) and ν2 (1574-1591 cm-1) bands after photodissociation, characteristic of a change in the Fe2+ spin state. For the high spin 5c-His AXCP, the intensity of ν4 is much stronger than that of ν2 (Fig. 4, spectrum a), whereas for the low-spin 5c-NO adduct the intensity of ν4 appears slightly smaller than that of ν2 (Fig. 4, spectrum b). In the case of the 4c photoproduct, the band ν4 is stronger than ν2 (spectra c-f), consistent with a high spin species. The ν3, ν4, and ν10 frequencies of 4c-AXCP are different from the respective values measured at steady state for a ferrous b-type heme of the hemeoxygenase mutant lacking the proximal His coordination but having a very weak ligand (31.Liu Y.

Open table in a new tab Molecular Dynamics Simulation−To visualize possible trajectories for NO within the heme pocket and possibly in the protein core after dissociation, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on the entire protein structure over a 50-ps time range after the cleavage of the Fe-NO bond. These calculations were performed without simulation of NO rebinding to the heme-iron to focus on NO motions and its possible escape. The 50-ps time range is long enough since the absorption kinetics revealed a ≥99% recombination after 50 ps. Eight independent calculations were performed on the AXCP dimer and are compared, not averaged, resulting in trajectories for 16 NO molecules (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 1 available on line). There was no difference in behavior between both monomers. The calculated trajectories are represented as the distances between Fe-N atoms and Fe-O atoms as a function of time after NO dissociation from the heme. Before NO dissociation, the structure equilibrated at 300 K has an average Fe-NO bond length of 1.9 Å and a distance of 3.0 Å between the iron and the oxygen atom of NO. The fluctuations of Fe-NO bond length at negative times correspond only to thermal vibrations (Fig. 5, A-B). Conspicuously, after breaking of the Fe-NO bond, the nitrogen atom moves immediately by 1 Å from iron and keeps this average position for the entire 50-ps range, whereas the oxygen atom keeps an average position at 3 Å from the iron, similar to its bound distance. This results in an overall tilt of the NO with respect to its equilibrium bound position, with a fluctuating motion around a stabilized position corresponding to NO having (on average) a more parallel orientation with respect to the heme plane. The Fe-N-O angle fluctuations are shown in Fig. 5B, with a mean value of 80-85°. The distance d(Fe, NO) = 3Å must be compared with that calculated in the case of myoglobin (32.Lambry J.C. Experimental and Theoretical Approaches of the Functional Molecular Dynamics of Myoglobin and Hemoglobin. Paris-Sud University, Orsay, France1997Google Scholar), which is 4.4 Å and has much larger fluctuations (up to 6 Å) than in the case of AXCP. For only 1 trajectory among 16 (number 2, chain 1 in Fig. 5A) the NO molecule moved transiently up to 5.5 Å from iron, exploring the heme pocket and retrieving its previous position at 3 Å in less than 10 ps. Fig. 6A compares three calculated structures of 5c-NO AXCP, showing the heme pocket conformation and the NO position before dissociation and 1 and 50 ps after the dissociation of NO. During all the trajectories NO remained within the proximal heme pocket. At 1 ps, NO had already adopted the position that it will keep during the entire dynamic trajectories, whereas His-120 had not, still being close to that of the equilibrium NO-liganded form. After relaxation, the His-120 side chain was tilted compared with the structure at 1 ps. During its trajectory within the heme pocket, NO came into close contact with atoms of particular side chains. Histograms of these closer positions over the entire 50-ps trajectory (Fig. 6C) revealed that"

Here we study the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae and its ability to influence and affect the cell cycle in two human target cell lines. We found that bacteria adhere equally well to cells synchronized into the different cell cycle phases of G1, S, and G2, but were unable to adhere to cells in M phase or G0 phase. In addition, using Western blot and/or flow cytometry analysis we demonstrate that bacterial infection for 24 h results in decreased levels of the cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin B1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E. Further studies in N. gonorrhoeae-infected epithelial cells involving analysis of DNA content, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, quantification of late mitotic cells and analysis of nuclear phenotype provide compelling evidence that a 24 h gonococcal infection arrests the cells in early G1 phase of the cell cycle. In summary, we present data showing that MS11 P+ strain of N. gonorrhoeae can down-regulate cyclins, important modulators of the cell cycle, and result in a G1 arrest."

The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are capped with special structures made of tandem DNA repeats and associated proteins, called telomeres. These structures protect chromosomes from end-to-end fusion, recombination, and nucleolytic degradation (1.Hug N. Lingner J.

However, because the conventional DNA replication machinery cannot fully duplicate the ends of linear chromosomes, telomeric DNA will shorten with each round of replication, leading to a replicative senescence (3.Lundblad V. Szostak J.W. Cell. 1989; 57: 633-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). To solve this end replication problem, most eukaryotes use the activity of an enzyme called telomerase to ensure the maintenance of telomeric DNA (4.Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase that can extend the 3′ end of chromosomes using its RNA subunit as a template for the addition of telomeric repeats. In vitro, telomerase activity requires a reverse transcriptase (Tert, Est2p in yeast) and an RNA template (Terc, Tlc1 in yeast) (5.Cohn M. Blackburn E.H. Science. 1995; 269: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 6.Lingner J. Cech T.R. Hughes T.R. Lundblad V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11190-11195Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In vivo, yeast telomerase requires additional factors for function, including Est1p, Est3p, and Cdc13p (3.Lundblad V. Szostak J.W. Cell. 1989; 57: 633-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 7.Lendvay T.S. Morris D.K. Sah J. Balasubramanian B. Lundblad V. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1399-1412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deleting any one of the EST1, EST2, EST3, or TLC1 genes or a particular allele of the CDC13 gene (cdc13-2) causes progressive telomere shortening leading to cellular senescence. Increased expression of individual telomerase genes may also lead to telomeric phenotypes. For example, overexpression of Tlc1 causes telomere shortening by sequestering the Tlc1-binding factor Ku (8.Singer M.S. Gottschling D.E. Science. 1994; 266: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 9.Peterson S.E. Stellwagen A.E. Diede S.J. Singer M.S. Haimberger Z.W. Johnson C.O. Tzoneva M. Gottschling D.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 64-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of Est1p may cause a slight telomere lengthening in some strains (10.Virta-Pearlman V. Morris D.K. Lundblad V. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3094-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). On the other hand, induction of Est1, Est2, and Est3 mRNA expression in cells with defective nonsense-mediated mRNA decay decreases telomere length (11.Dahlseid J.N. Lew-Smith J. Lelivelt M.J. Enomoto S. Ford A. Desruisseaux M. McClellan M. Lue N. Culbertson M.R. Berman J. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that a variation in the expression levels of the different components of telomerase holoenzyme influences telomerase function. However, the cellular mechanisms that regulate and balance the expression of the different components of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein remain unknown. Telomere elongation occurs in late S or early G2/M phases of the cell cycle (12.Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1999; 99: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 13.Marcand S. Brevet V. Mann C. Gilson E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 487-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the catalytic core of telomerase (Est2p and Tlc1) is present at yeast telomeres throughout the cell cycle but requires an association of Est1p, which accumulates in the S phase of the cell cycle (14.Taggart A.K. Teng S.C. Zakian V.A. Science. 2002; 297: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 15.Taggart A.K. Zakian V.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity on the telomeres is negatively regulated by Pif1p, a helicase that is thought to remove telomerase from the chromosome ends (16.Boule J.B. Vega L.R. Zakian V.A. Nature. 2005; 438: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, the Rif proteins also exert a negative role on telomere length maintenance (17.Wotton D. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and several other proteins involved in the DNA damage check-point and repair pathways were shown to influence steady-state telomere length in vivo (18.d’Adda di Fagagna F. Teo S.H. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1781-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). At least some of the factors regulating telomere length influence the activity of the telomerase subunits, yet very little is known about the mechanisms regulating the expression of the telomerase subunits. Here we show that the expression level of several telomerase subunits is regulated post-transcriptionally by yeast RNase III (Rnt1p). Rnt1p is a double-stranded RNA-specific endoribonuclease involved in the maturation of many RNAs, including small nuclear RNAs, snoRNAs, 3The abbreviations used are: snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. and pre-rRNAs (19.Abou Elela S.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2741-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that Rnt1p regulates the expression of glucose-dependent genes, degrades unspliced mRNAs, and cleaves mRNAs with abnormal 3′ ends (22.Ge D. Lamontagne B. Elela S.A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 140-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23.Danin-Kreiselman M. Lee C.Y. Chanfreau G. Mol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 28997-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The majority of Rnt1p substrates include a short RNA stem capped with an AGNN tetraloop structure (26.Lebars I. Lamontagne B. Yoshizawa S. Abou-Elela S. Fourmy D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7250-7258Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These particular structures are cleaved at a fixed distance from the tetraloop (27.Chanfreau G. Buckle M. Jacquier A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3142-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28.Nagel R. Ares Jr., M. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2000; 6: 1142-1156Google Scholar, 29.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Elela S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Deletion of RNT1 induced the expression of many components of telomerase, leading to an increase in telomerase activity and elongation of the telomeres. A point mutation that impairs catalytic activity of Rnt1p without affecting its expression or interaction with RNA fails to restore normal expression of telomerase subunits or reduce telomere lengths. In silico analysis revealed a canonical Rnt1p cleavage site within the coding sequence of the Est1 mRNA. In vitro analyses showed that this predicted structure was directly cleaved by Rnt1p in the absence of other factors. Disruption of this Rnt1p cleavage site by silent mutations impaired the cell cycle-dependent regulation of Est1 mRNA, suggesting that Rnt1p triggers RNA cleavage in a cell cycle-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that the expression level of the telomerase subunits influences their function and reveal a new regulatory mechanism that controls the accumulation of telomerase-related RNAs. Strains and Plasmids−All yeast strains were grown and manipulated using standard procedures (30.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology.

RNT1 (NLYH15) and rnt1Δ (NLYH12) cells harboring protein A-tagged EST2 were created by crossing strains YKF103 (MATa; ura3–52; ade 2–101; lys2–801; leu2Δ1; trp1Δ1; his3-Δ200/CF+ (TRP1 SUP11)) (35.Friedman K.L. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and DUY746 (MATα; leu2–3,112; his3; trp1; pep4; prc1; HIS3:pet56:rnt1). 4D. Ursic, personal communication. Strain SLY150 (EST1–4) was constructed by inserting 4 silent mutations (T2061/C; G2064/A; C2067/T; C2070/T) within the EST1 coding sequence in JPY112 (MATa/α; lys2Δ0/lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0; his3Δ200/his3Δ200; leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0; RNT1/rnt1Δ::KMX4), a derivative of BY4705. The DNA fragment used for the replacement of 4 nucleotides was created by cloning two PCR fragments in the pVZ1 vector (36.Henikoff S. Eghtedarzadeh M.K. Genetics. 1987; 117: 711-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first PCR fragment was amplified using primers 5′-CCAGACGAAGCAATTGA-TGCTGACGAAGATATTACCGTCCAAGTGCC-3′ and 5′-GCTGGGTACCGGGCCCCCCCTCGAGGTCG-3′. The amplified sequence corresponds to the 3′ end of EST1 and contains 4 mutations disrupting the Rnt1p cleavage site. The second PCR fragment was amplified using primers 5′-CAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCACC-3′ and 5′-GTATTGACAGCATATATATTTGCTGTCTTGAATTTATTATGCTAATAAATAATTATGTTTTTCAAGCGCACTGTGCGGTATTTCACACC. The amplified fragment contains the URA3 gene and a short sequence of EST1. The integration of the DNA fragment in the yeast genome was selected by growth in the absence of uracil and the marker was removed by counterselection on 5-fluoroorotic acid. SLY178 (EST1–4; bar1Δ::URA3) was generated by deleting the BAR1 gene from SLY150 as previously described (37.Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). MLY30 strain (bar1Δ::HIS3) was constructed by deleting the BAR1 gene in BY4705a strain (MATa; ade2Δ::hisG; met15Δ0; trp1Δ63; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0; his3Δ200; leu2Δ0; bar1Δ::HIS3) (38.Larrivee M. LeBel C. Wellinger R.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In Vitro RNA Cleavage−In vitro cleavage reactions were performed as described previously (29.Lamontagne B. Ghazal G. Lebars I. Yoshizawa S. Fourmy D. Elela S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 985-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cleavage of model RNA substrates was performed using T7-synthesized transcripts and recombinant Rnt1p (0.2 pmol) (39.Lamontagne B. Abou Elela S. Purification and Characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rnt1p Nuclease. Academic Press, San Diego2001Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in a 20-μl reaction buffer containing 150 mm KCl and incubated 20 min at 30 °C. Cleavage of total RNA extracted from yeast was performed as described previously (22.Ge D. Lamontagne B. Elela S.A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 140-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of total RNA was incubated with 4 pmol of recombinant Rnt1p for 10 min at 30 °C as described for the cleavage of model substrates. Analysis of mRNA Stability−The stability of the different mRNAs was determined after inhibiting transcription using 10 μg/ml of thiolutin as previously described (22.Ge D. Lamontagne B. Elela S.A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 140-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 26 °C to mid-log phase and RNA was extracted at different time points after the addition of the drug. The levels of mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR using RPR1 (pol III transcript) as an internal control. Half-lives were estimated using the single exponential decay formula y = 100 e–bx. Thiolutin was kindly provided by Pfizer (Groton, CT). Primer Extension and Northern Blot Analysis−Primer extension was performed using a primer specific for EST1 (5′-GGGTTGACGACGACAGGCGTGG-3′) as described previously (19.Abou Elela S. Ares Jr., M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3738-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Extended products were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Northern blots were performed as described previously (19.Abou Elela S. Ares Jr., M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3738-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) using 15 μg of total RNA and a 1% denaturing agarose gel or a 4% polyacrylamide gel. The RNA was visualized by autoradiography using randomly labeled probes corresponding to specific genes. The RNA was quantified using Instant Imager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Real-time PCR Analysis−Synthesis of cDNA was performed using 2 μg of total RNA and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Gene-specific primer protocol using a “Flap sequence” common to all primers was used to avoid DNA amplification during subsequent PCR amplification. The cDNA was purified with Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). Q-PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM 7700 (Applied Biosystems) as previously described (40.Giulietti A. Overbergh L. Valckx D. Decallonne B. Bouillon R. Mathieu C. Methods. 2001; 25 (San Diego): 386-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). PCR were done in triplicate using a 25-μl reaction volume. TaqMan probes (5′,6-FAM, 3′-TAMRA) and specific primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were used at concentrations of 250 and 900 nm, respectively, in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 0.625 units of homemade Taq (41.Engelke D.R. Krikos A. Bruck M.E. Ginsburg D. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), 0.25 unit of UDG (New England Biolabs, Pickering, ON), 50 nm ROX Reference Dye (Invitrogen), 200 μm dATP/dGTP/dCTP, 400 μm dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Data were analyzed by the comparative threshold method.

Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted from cells grown to mid-log phase. 5 μg of genomic DNA was digested with XhoI, separated on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences). DNA was visualized by autoradiography with a randomly labeled telomeric probe. Cell Cycle Synchronization and FACS Analysis−Cells were synchronized in G1 by the addition of α-factor (Bioshop, Burlington, ON) at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml for 3 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in fresh media containing 200 μg/ml Pronase (Roche Diagnostics) to release the cells from their arrest. Samples were taken at different time points to either extract RNA or monitor the release into the cell cycle by FACS analysis as described previously (34.Catala M. Lamontagne B. Larose S. Ghazal G. Elela S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3015-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The RNAs corresponding to the different genes was quantified by real-time PCR using Rpr1 as an internal control. Western Blot and Telomerase Activity−Telomerase assays were performed as previously described (35.Friedman K.L. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The EST2 gene was modified to incorporate an N-terminal Protein A tag as described (35.Friedman K.L. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed using IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and 2 mg of total protein extracted from either RNT1 (NLYH15) or rnt1Δ (NLYH12) cells. Extension of a telomeric primer (5′-TAGGGTAGTAGTAGGG-3′) was monitored to determine telomerase activity. Quantifications were performed using a Storm PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Amersham Biosciences). Total protein (30 μg) or immunoprecipitated proteins were run on an 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were performed using 1:7500 diluted (total protein) or 1:5000 diluted (immunoprecipitated protein) polyclonal rabbit anti-protein A antibodies (Sigma). Donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as a secondary antibody to allow detection with ECL Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences). After membrane stripping, blots were incubated with mouse anti-PGK Ig diluted 1:500 (Molecular Probes) as primary and sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:5000 (Amersham Biosciences) as secondary antibody. Detection and quantification were done using a Storm Fluorescence Imager (Storm 860, Amersham Biosciences). Non-linear Regression Analysis and Graph Generation−The graphs shown in Fig. 5C were generated using GraphPad Prism version 4.03 for Windows (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The data from three independent experiments for EST1–4; bar1Δ cells and two independent experiments for EST1; bar1Δ were used for the analysis. To choose the best equation to model the data, we compared the different classical equations and all polynomial order equations available in GraphPad. To select the best equation type, we used an F test with p < 0.05. Two-by-two comparisons were performed to identify the simplest model that best fit the data. The equation used is a polynomial of the fourth order(Y=A+B·X+C·X2^+D·X3^+E·X4^). The obtained values are shown in supplemental Table 1. The use of non-linear regression was required because the mRNA level is affected by many variables: mRNA decay, Rnt1p cleavage, constitutive expression, and cell cycle-dependent expression. The use of a non-linear regression also allows for the two main sources of variation in the measurement (normal experimental variation and variation in the cell synchronization) to be determined. We previously performed a microarray analysis of RNA extracted from cells lacking RNT1 and compared it with RNA from wild type cells (22.Ge D. Lamontagne B. Elela S.A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 140-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After detailed inspection of the data, we noticed that many telomerase-related mRNAs were induced upon the deletion of RNT1 (Fig. 1A). This induced expression of RNAs coding for telomerase subunits was similar to that of known Rnt1p substrates like Rps22B (23.Danin-Kreiselman M. Lee C.Y. Chanfreau G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and Mig2 (22.Ge D. Lamontagne B. Elela S.A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 140-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) mRNAs. The impact of RNT1 deletion on the expression of telomerase-related RNAs was verified by Northern blot analysis. Consistent with the microarray data, the mRNAs coding for the main components of the telomerase RNP complex (Est1, Est2, and Est3) and the telomerase RNA Tlc1 accumulated in the absence of Rnt1p (Fig. 1B). No major increase in the RNA amounts coding for other telomere-related proteins like Cdc13, Ten1, and Tel1 were detected by Northern blot (data not shown). We conclude that Rnt1p is required for normal expression of most core telomerase subunits. If Rnt1p influences the stability of Est1, Est2, Est3, and Tlc1 RNAs, we expected the deletion of RNT1 to slow the turnover and increase the half-life of these RNAs. To examine this possibility, the half-life of each affected RNA was determined in wild type and rnt1Δ cells after inhibiting new transcription using thiolutin. Quantitative PCR analysis was used to estimate the mRNA amounts at different time points after transcription inhibition and the half-life was calculated for each RNA species (Table 2). We used two unrelated RNAs (Spt15 and Act1) with different half-lives and that are thought not to be directly affected by Rnt1p as controls (supplemental Fig. 1). Indeed, the half-lives of these control RNAs were only slightly longer in rnt1Δ cells when compared with that in wild type cells due to a general slow metabolism of rnt1Δ cells (Table 2 and data not shown). In contrast, these experiments showed a significant increase in the half-lives of Est1, Est2, and Est3 mRNAs (Table 2). As previously described, the Tlc1 RNA was already very stable in wild type cells (43.Chapon C. Cech T.R. Zaug A.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 1337-1351PubMed Google Scholar), and no decay was observed in both wild type and rnt1Δ cells even after 1 h of transcription inhibition (Table 2). When normalized to Spt15, the relative half-lives of Est1 and Est2 were about 2 times longer in rnt1Δ than in wild type cells, whereas that of Est3 was only slightly longer in rnt1Δ cells (Fig. 1C). If the increase in the half-life of the Est2 mRNA of about 2-fold was significant, it should lead to a corresponding increase in the amount of Est2p. Indeed, deleting RNT1 in cells expressing a protein A-tagged version of the telomerase catalytic subunit Est2p increased the expression of both mRNA and protein expression by 2 to 3 times as compared with that detected in wild type cells (supplemental Fig. 2 and Fig. 1D). We conclude that deletion of RNT1 slows the decay rate of several telomerase-related mRNAs leading to an increase in the expression of these telomerase subunits.TABLE 2Half-lives of different telomerase mRNA componentsGene nameStrainRNT1rnt1Δaverage half-life (min)EST110.8 ± 0.631.2 ± 5.5EST27.2 ± 1.222.1 ± 6.2EST317.9 ± 3.634.5 ± 5.7TLC1>60.0>60.0SPT1512.4 ± 2.318.7 ± 3.8 Open table in a new tab To evaluate the impact of Rnt1p on telomerase function, we examined telomere length in wild type and rnt1Δ cells by Southern blotting. DNA was extracted from relevant strains and digested with the restriction enzyme XhoI. Due to a conserved XhoI site in the telomere-proximal Y′-elements, many terminal restriction fragments appear as somewhat smeary bands of about 1.2 kb size on such blots (44.LeBel C. Larrivee M. Bah A. Laterreur N. Lvesque N. Wellinger R.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 265-316PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of Rnt1p, the size of the terminal restriction fragments increased as compared with that of wild type cells, indicating that the deletion of RNT1 increases telomere length (Fig. 2A). This increase in telomere length is directly linked to the expression of Rnt1p, because transformation of rnt1Δ cells with a plasmid harboring RNT1 restores normal telomere length (Fig. 2A). We next examined whether this increase in telomere length is associated with an increase in telomerase activity. Relative telomerase activity was assessed in extracts derived from wild type and rnt1Δ cells expressing a protein A-tagged version of Est2p. In this procedure, telomerase was partially purified using IgG-Sepharose beads and used for a direct extension of a telomeric primer (44.LeBel C. Larrivee M. Bah A. Laterreur N. Lvesque N. Wellinger R.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 265-316PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, deletion of RNT1 resulted in an increase in relative telomerase activity as compared with the internal control (Fig. 2B). The observed activity is telomerase specific, because it is RNA dependent and was not observed in precipitates from untagged cells. The observed increase in the telomerase activity is Rnt1p-dependent but strain background-independent and was also observed after the inactivation of a temperature-sensitive allele of RNT1 (data not shown). Thus, the accumulation of the RNAs of telomerase core subunits upon the deletion of Rnt1p leads to an increase in both its in vitro activity and telomere length. Deletion of Rnt1p affects many cellular pathways and slows cell metabolism (34.Catala M. Lamontagne B. Larose S. Ghazal G. Elela S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3015-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To ensure that the increased levels of RNA of telomerase subunits is not a secondary effect generated by long term changes in cell metabolism, we monitored the kinetics of telomerase induction upon inactivating a temperature-sensitive allele of Rnt1p (rnt1-ts) (22.Ge D. Lamontagne B. Elela S.A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 140-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). If the RNAs coding for the telomerase subunits are targets of Rnt1p-mediated RNA metabolism, their steady-state levels should change with the same kinetics at that of known Rnt1p substrates (e.g. snoRNAs). Total RNA was extracted from rnt1-ts cells at different intervals after shift to the restrictive temperature (37 °C). The extracted RNA was analyzed using Northern blots or real-time PCR. As expected, Northern blots probed with a snR43-specific probe, a known substrate of Rnt1p, documented a processing defect as early as 2 h after shift to 37 °C (Fig. 3A). Real-time PCR analysis of the same RNA samples indicated that similar to snR43, the levels for RNAs coding for the telomerase subunits increased 2 h after shift to the restrictive temperature (Fig. 3B).

Here we have shown that apoptotic and microtubule-disrupting agents promote catalytic activation, C-terminal cleavage, and nuclear translocation of endogenous phosphoserine 181 PSK1-α and activated N-terminal PSK1-α-induced apoptosis. PSK1-α, unlike its novel isoform PSK1-β, stimulated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, and the nuclear localization of PSK1-α and its induction of cell contraction, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic body formation were dependent on JNK activity. PSK1-α was also a caspase substrate, and the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone or mutation of a putative caspase recognition motif (916DPGD919) blocked nuclear localization of PSK1-α and its induction of membrane blebs. Additional inhibition of caspase 9 was needed to prevent cell contraction. PSK1-α is therefore a bifunctional kinase that associates with microtubules, and JNK- and caspase-mediated removal of its C-terminal microtubule-binding domain permits nuclear translocation of the N-terminal region of PSK1-α and its induction of apoptosis.

Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). STE20s divide into two subfamilies according to their structure and regulation. The p21-activated kinases have a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal Cdc42/Rac-interacting domain, whereas the germinal center kinase (GCK)-like kinases possess an N-terminal catalytic domain and no Cdc42/Rac-interacting domain. p21-activated kinases interact with Rac or Cdc42 GTPases via the Cdc42/Rac-interacting domain and act as downstream effectors for these small GTP-binding proteins, but much less is known about the regulation of GCKs (2Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 3Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Most STE20s activate one or more of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, although their biological responses do not always require MAPKs (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). PSK1-α belongs to the GCK-like kinase class of STE20s and activates JNK via its N-terminal catalytic domain, and through its C-terminal regulatory domain, binds to microtubules and regulates their organization and stability (4Moore T.M.

Several STE20 kinases and the JNK family of MAPKs have been implicated in apoptosis (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an important process in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms and is triggered by various stimuli, such as cytokines and DNA damage. Apoptosis is characterized by morphological changes that include cytoplasmic contraction, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies (7Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar, 8Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). These morphological alterations frequently involve the activation of caspases, a family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases, either by Fas-associated death domain-mediated aggregation of death receptors or by release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (9Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar, 10Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Both stimuli trigger distinct initiator caspases to activate downstream effector caspases, which cleave and regulate various target proteins involved in signaling cell survival and proliferation, DNA synthesis and repair, as well as components of the cell cytoskeleton (10Nunez G.

In addition, pro-apoptotic proteins, such as the STE20 kinases mammalian STE20-like kinases 1–3 (MST1–3), STE20-like kinase, or hematopoietic progenitor kinase, are cleaved by caspases to produce constitutively activated fragments (18Chen Z.

However, the role of these target proteins in mediating particular apoptotic events is poorly understood, with a few exceptions that include caspase cleavage and the subsequent activation of the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase leading to DNA fragmentation and Rho kinase-1 (ROCK-I), which plays an important role in membrane blebbing (24Enari M.

We have shown previously that PSK1-α specifically activates the JNK-signaling pathway via its N-terminal kinase domain, whereas the C terminus of PSK1-α binds to microtubules and regulates their organization and stability (4Moore T.M.

Here we show that apoptosis-inducing agents, such as paclitaxel and staurosporine, stimulated cleavage, activation, and nuclear localization of PSK1-α and that the N-terminal kinase domain of PSK1-α induced JNK- and caspase-dependent apoptotic morphological alterations. C-terminal cleavage and nuclear localization of catalytically active PSK1-α is mediated via JNK and caspase activity and is a necessary step for the induction of apoptosis by PSK1-α. In contrast, a novel splice variant PSK-1β, which has a different C-terminal sequence, does not activate JNK or induce apoptosis. Plasmids and Reagents—pRK5-Myc-PSK1-α and pRK5-Myc-PSK1-α (K57A) were made as described previously (4Moore T.M. Garg R. Johnson C. Coptcoat M.J. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4311-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). pRK5-Myc-PSK1-α-(1–745), pRK5-Myc-PSK1-α-(1–745, K57A), and pRK5-Myc-PSK1-α(D919N) were prepared by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides. pRK5-Myc-PSK1-β and pRK5-Myc-PSK1-β (K57A) were prepared from the human cDNA clone KIAA0881 obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (gift from Dr. T. Nagase). Colleagues donated the following plasmids: pCMV-FLAG-JNK1 (Dr. M. Karin, University of California), pGEX-c-Jun (Dr. J. Ham, Eisai London Research Laboratories), and dominant negative pCDNA3-FLAG-JNK1 (Dr. R. Davis, University of Massachusetts). The caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and Z-LEHD-fmk were obtained from Calbiochem. Paclitaxel was obtained from Sigma. Transient Cell Expression—COS-1 cells and human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (H1299) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (10% CO2, 37 °C). For transfection, 2 × 105 cells/2 ml of medium or 5 × 105 cells/4 ml of medium were seeded onto 35- or 60-mm Petri dishes, respectively. After 16 h, the indicated plasmids were transfected into COS-1 cells or H1299 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Immunoblotting—Cultures were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4). 100 μg of total protein were separated using 8–15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (4Moore T.M. Garg R. Johnson C. Coptcoat M.J. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4311-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-phospho-MKK4 and anti-phospho-JNK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit anti-phospho-c-Jun and mouse anti-α-tubulin antibodies were obtained from Abcam or Sigma, respectively. Mouse anti-Myc and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (anti-PARP) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or R & D Systems, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against CPANS(P)FVGTC coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and affinity-purified to detect PSK1 phosphorylated on serine residue 181 (Eurogentec). Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractionation—H1299 cells (2 × 106) were seeded onto 100-mm Petri dishes in 8 ml of medium and treated as indicated. Cell cultures were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (4 ml), pelleted by centrifugation (600g, 5 min), and cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Vision Research Products). Total amounts of protein were determined using a protein assay kit (Pierce), and 100 μg of protein was separated using 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for analysis by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation, in Vitro Kinase Assays, Immunofluorescence, and Confocal Microscopy—These procedures were carried out as described previously (28Zihni C. Mitsopoulos C. Tavares I.A. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7317-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, for immunoprecipitation, 400 μg of protein in 1 ml of binding buffer (130 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) was mixed with 3 μg of anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C and then 100 μl of 10% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. For in vitro kinase assays, beads were placed in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) containing 20 μm ATP, 5 μCi of (γ-32P)ATP (MP Biomedicals, 3000 Ci/mmol), and 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun protein or 1 μg of myelin basic protein and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting or analysis using a phosphorimaging device (Fuji). For immunofluorescence experiments, H1299 cells (2 × 105) were transfected with the indicated plasmids at the times shown in the figure legends. Cultures were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3.7% formaldehyde (20 min), and cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (5 min). Myc-tagged PSKs, FLAG-tagged JNK, and actin were detected as described previously (28Zihni C. Mitsopoulos C. Tavares I.A. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7317-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-PSK antibody PEP1 (5Mitsopoulos C. Zihni C. Garg R. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol.

In control experiments, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence signals were abolished in the presence of the appropriate peptide. Cells were imaged with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Caspase Cleavage Assays—In vitro caspase cleavage assays were performed as described previously (28Zihni C. Mitsopoulos C. Tavares I.A. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7317-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PSK1-α (but Not Its Novel Isoform PSK1-β) Activated JNK—During the original isolation of PSK, we described an apparent isoform for this protein that is identical over the N-terminal kinase domain (amino acids 1–744) but contains a different C terminus (amino acids 745–1049) (4Moore T.M. Garg R. Johnson C. Coptcoat M.J. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4311-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Analysis of the human genome sequence has shown that a single gene located on chromosome 16 (locus 51677) encodes both isoforms of PSK. PSK1-α (previously referred to as PSK) and its novel isoform PSK1-β are generated from a primary transcript(s) containing the common exons 1–16 and either one (exon 17) or three additional exons (exons 18–20), respectively (Fig. 1A). PSK1-α was shown previously to stimulate the JNK MAPK signaling pathway, and we set out to determine whether PSK1-β could also activate JNK (4Moore T.M. Garg R. Johnson C. Coptcoat M.J. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4311-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged PSK1-α, PSK1-β, or their identical N-terminal region PSK1-α-(1–745) were expressed in COS-1 cells and immune complexes for each protein prepared from cell lysates. In in vitro kinase assays, PSK1-α, PSK1-β, and PSK1-α-(1–745) each underwent autophosphorylation and phosphorylated myelin basic protein (MBP) (Fig. 1B), whereas their kinase-defective counterparts were unable to phosphorylate themselves or MBP (Fig. 1B). PSK1-α, PSK1-β, or PSK1-α-(1–745) were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged JNK into COS-1 cells and immune complexes of JNK prepared from cell lysates for in vitro kinase assays using recombinant c-Jun as a substrate. Transfected PSK1-α or PSK1-α-(1–745) activated JNK and stimulated the phosphorylation of c-Jun, whereas PSK1-β was unable to increase the levels of phosphorylated c-Jun above those obtained using the kinase-defective mutants for each of these proteins (Fig. 1C). The failure of PSK1-β to activate JNK, when compared with its N-terminal fragment PSK1-α-(1–745), suggests that the C terminus of PSK1-β is inhibitory for this function. PSK1-α-induced Cell Contraction, Membrane Blebbing, and Cleavage of PARP—Because JNK activation has been shown to play important roles in the regulation of apoptosis and some STE20-like kinases can regulate cytoskeletal organization, we examined whether PSK1-α could stimulate changes in cell morphology that are associated with apoptosis (4Moore T.M.

In non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (H1299), PSK1-α and PSK1-α-(1–745) induced a marked reduction in cell spread area and caused cell rounding and substantial membrane blebbing as well as the formation of apoptotic bodies (Fig. 2, A–C). In contrast, kinase-defective PSK1-α (K57A) caused no significant cell contraction or membrane blebbing and localized to filamentous structures previously shown to be microtubules (Fig. 2, A–C) (5Mitsopoulos C. Zihni C. Garg R. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18085-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PSK1-β localized to a different perinuclear site and had no detectable effect on either cell size or membrane morphology (Fig. 2, A–C). Kinase-defective PSK1-β (K57A), PSK1-α-(1–745, K57A), as well as green fluorescent protein (GFP) did not cause significant cell contraction or membrane blebbing (Fig. 2, B and C). In addition to the effects of PSK1-α on cell morphology, we also tested whether PSK1-α induced cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an event commonly associated with cells that are undergoing apoptosis (30Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). Expression of PSK1-α (but not PSK1-α (K57A), PSK1-β, or PSK1-β (K57A) caused cleavage of 116-kDa PARP to generate the 85-kDa fragment that is characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 2D). Paclitaxel-stimulated Activation and Phosphorylation of Endogenous PSK1—Analysis of the crystal structure of the kinase domain of PSK1-α (also referred to as TAO2) indicates that the phosphorylation of serine 181 in the activation loop of PSK1-α is involved in its conformational activation (31Zhou T. Raman M. Gao Y. Earnest S. Chen Z. Machius M. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1891-1900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To examine the activation and localization of endogenous kinases, an antibody was made against a peptide that mimicked PSK1-α phosphorylated on serine 181 (PSK1-pS181). To test whether the anti-PSK1-pS181 antibody could detect PSK1-α and PSK1-β, cells were transfected with Myc-tagged PSK1-α, PSK1-α (K57A), PSK1-β, or PSK1-β (K57A). The anti-PSK1-pS181 antibody detected catalytically active and phosphorylated forms of transfected PSK1-α and PSK1-β but not their kinase-defective counterparts, demonstrating that this antibody only recognized catalytically active and autophosphorylated forms of the proteins but was unable to distinguish between the two PSK1 isoforms (Fig. 3A). In addition, treatment of H1299 cells with the microtubule-stabilizing and apoptotic agent paclitaxel induced the appearance of endogenous phosphorylated PSK1-pS181 at 16 h (Fig. 3A). Expression of transfected PSKs was confirmed using anti-Myc antibody, which detected the 185- and 165-kDa protein doublet that is characteristic for PSK1-α and also PSK1-β at 165 kDa (Fig. 3A) (4Moore T.M. Garg R. Johnson C. Coptcoat M.J. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4311-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the anti-PSK1-pS181 antibody was unable to detect the 185-kDa form of PSK1-α (Fig. 3A). More rapid time courses demonstrated that paclitaxel stimulated the appearance of endogenous phosphorylated PSK1-pS181 after 1–6 h (Fig. 3B). Paclitaxel also stimulated the activation and phosphorylation of endogenous JNK (46 and 54 kDa) after 2–6 h, suggesting that PSK1 could contribute to paclitaxel-stimulated JNK (Fig. 3B). PSK1-α Localized to the Nucleus as Well as Microtubules—We have shown previously that PSK1-α can localize to the cytoplasm and bind to microtubules (5Mitsopoulos C. Zihni C. Garg R. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18085-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To examine the subcellular distribution of PSK1-α, cells expressing PSK1-α or kinase-defective PSK1-α (K57A) were immunostained with antibodies that recognize each end of the protein. 9E10 anti-Myc antibody was used to detect the N-terminal Myc epitope tag attached to PSK1-α and demonstrated that PSK1-α localized to microtubules in the cytoplasm; however, this antibody also showed that PSK1-α was present in the nucleus (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, kinase-defective PSK1-α (K57A) was only found on microtubules in the cytoplasm and was excluded from the nucleus, demonstrating that the catalytic activity of PSK1-α was required for its nuclear localization (Fig. 4, A and B). Cells were also co-stained with an antibody that was raised against the C terminus of PSK1-α (amino acids 1216–1235) (named PEP1). This antibody recognized both PSK1-α and PSK1-α (K57A) on microtubules (Fig. 4A) but was unable to detect the nuclear form of PSK1-α identified using the 9E10 antibody, demonstrating that nuclear PSK1-α lacked a recognizable C-terminal epitope (Fig. 4A). Taken together, these results suggest that full-length PSK1-α binds to microtubules in the cytoplasm, whereas a C-terminally truncated form of PSK1-α is present in the nucleus. We have shown previously that the C terminus of PSK1-α (amino acids 1064–1235) can bind to α- and β-tubulin, and it is plausible that the removal of these sequences permits the protein to relocate from the microtubules to the nucleus (5Mitsopoulos C. Zihni C. Garg R. Ridley A.J. Morris J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18085-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Indeed, PSK1-α-(1–745), which lacks the microtubule-binding domain, localized to the cell nucleus (Fig. 4B). Kinase-defective PSK1-α-(1–745,K57A) also localized to the nucleus of transfected cells, unlike full-length PSK1-α (K57A), which remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B). Removal of the C-terminal microtubule-binding domain was therefore sufficient for nuclear localization of PSK1-α. In contrast, PSK1-β and kinase-defective PSK1-β (K57A) were not detected in the nucleus (Fig. 4B). These findings led us to examine the localization of phosphorylated endogenous PSK1-pS181 by immunoblotting. Cultures were treated with paclitaxel for 3 or 6 h and cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions prepared from cell lysates. Immunoblotting with anti-PSK1-pS181 antibody detected the presence of phosphorylated endogenous PSK1 (165 kDa) in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 4C). In contrast, an additional 85-kDa N-terminal fragment of phosphorylated PSK1-pser181 was found solely in the nuclear fraction along with the nuclear marker protein Oct-1 (Fig. 4C). The paclitaxel-induced nuclear 85-kDa form of PSK1-pS181 was not observed when cultures were pretreated with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 4D). These results show that paclitaxel stimulated the production of an N-terminally phosphorylated form of endogenous PSK1-pS181 that was found exclusively in the nucleus. JNK Activity Was Required for Nuclear Localization of PSK1-α and Its Induction of Cell Contraction and Membrane Blebbing—The results presented above demonstrate that the catalytic activity of PSK1-α and potentially its nuclear localization are important for the induction of cell contraction and membrane blebbing. To determine whether the activation of JNK by PSK1-α was involved in the stimulation of apoptosis, we tested the effects of dominant negative JNK and found that the expression of dominant negative JNK inhibited the induction of cell contraction and membrane blebbing by PSK1-α (Fig. 5, A and B). Dominant negative JNK expression resulted in the retention of PSK1-α on microtubules and its exclusion from the nucleus (Fig. 5, A and B). We also investigated the effects of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 on these processes and found that the inhibitor prevented nuclear localization of PSK1-α as well as its induction of cell contraction and membrane blebbing (Fig. 5, A and B). SP600125 did not inhibit the activity and autophosphorylation of transfected PSK1-α or subsequent phosphorylation of MKK4 or JNK but did prevent the phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that the activation of JNK by PSK1-α was required for its induction of membrane blebbing and cell contraction as well as nuclear localization. Caspases Mediated Cleavage of PSK1-α—Several members of the GCK-like STE20 family are caspase 3 substrates, and we set out to determine whether this proteolytic enzyme could also cleave PSK1-α (18Chen Z.

https://openalex.org/W1982272995,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are responsible for attaching amino acids to their cognate tRNAs during protein synthesis. In eukaryotes aaRSs are commonly found in multi-enzyme complexes, although the role of these complexes is still not completely clear. Associations between aaRSs have also been reported in archaea, including a complex between prolyl-(ProRS) and leucyl-tRNA synthetases (LeuRS) in Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus that enhances tRNAPro aminoacylation. Yeast two-hybrid screens suggested that lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) also associates with LeuRS in M. thermautotrophicus. Co-purification experiments confirmed that LeuRS, LysRS, and ProRS associate in cell-free extracts. LeuRS bound LysRS and ProRS with a comparable KD of about 0.3–0.9 μm, further supporting the formation of a stable multi-synthetase complex. The steady-state kinetics of aminoacylation by LysRS indicated that LeuRS specifically reduced the Km for tRNALys over 3-fold, with no additional change seen upon the addition of ProRS. No significant changes in aminoacylation by LeuRS or ProRS were observed upon the addition of LysRS. These findings, together with earlier data, indicate the existence of a functional complex of three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in archaea in which LeuRS improves the catalytic efficiency of tRNA aminoacylation by both LysRS and ProRS.

To ensure that the correct amino acid is incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain during protein biosynthesis, the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) 2The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; HMD, H2-forming N5-N10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase; LeuRS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase; LysRS, lysyl-tRNA synthetase; MARS, multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex; ProRS, prolyl-tRNA synthetase; AF, Alexa fluor. must attach the correct amino acid to the corresponding tRNA molecule (1Ibba M. Francklyn C. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005Google Scholar). This essential process, in turn, supplies the ribosome with the aminoacyl-tRNAs that are critical for the synthesis of proteins in all cells. The aaRSs can be divided into two groups, class I and II, based on the architecture of the catalytic domain (2Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 3Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Hartlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R.

Class I aaRSs, which are normally monomeric, attach the aminoacyl group to the 2′-OH of the 3′ terminal nucleotide of the tRNA, whereas class II aaRSs catalyze the addition to the 3′-OH of the tRNA and are usually dimeric. In bacteria, the aaRSs normally act alone as free-standing proteins, although in some instances their activities are enhanced by association with other translation factors (5An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34465-34472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Zhang C.M. Perona J.J. Ryu K. Francklyn C. Hou Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 300-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic organisms, aaRSs are commonly found in multi-enzyme complexes within the cell that are believed to stabilize the interaction between tRNAs and synthetases, thereby increasing the efficiency of aminoacylation. These multi-enzyme complexes vary depending on the specific aaRSs and accessory proteins involved. For example, a complex forms between two synthetases and a non-synthetase protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and there is also evidence for functional interactions between seryl-tRNA synthetase and a peroxisomal protein (8Rocak S. Landeka I. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 214: 101-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as between tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and a protein involved in the regulation of cell wall assembly in yeast (9Dagkessamanskaia A. Martin-Yken H. Basmaji F. Briza P. Francois J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 200: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A complex of valyl-tRNA synthetase and human elongation factor-1H (10Negrutskii B.S. Shalak V.F. Kerjan P. El'skaya A.V. Mirande M. J. Biol.

Association with non-synthetase components in the larger complex may not only promote efficient aminoacylation and substrate channeling (14Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) but also function in other processes beyond translation such as gene silencing, apoptosis, and inflammation (12Park S.G. Ewalt K.L.

No bacterial multi-aaRS complexes have yet been described, and there is only sparse data concerning their existence in archaeal species. An early report indicated the presence of a multi-synthetase complex in the extreme halophile Haloarcula marismortui, with many if not all of the aaRSs purified in one or possibly two large complexes (16Goldgur Y. Safro M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 32: 1075-1083PubMed Google Scholar). A subsequent study in Methanocaldoccus jannaschii revealed the presence of a non-synthetase protein bound to purified prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) and further suggested that both aspartyl- and the class I-type lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS1) might also be part of this complex (17Lipman R.S. Chen J. Evilia C. Vitseva O. Hou Y.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7487-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cellular role of the M. jannaschii complex, however, remains unclear because the aaRS activities were essentially unchanged upon complex formation. Recently, a yeast two-hybrid screen also revealed a complex between ProRS and leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) in Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (18Praetorius-Ibba M. Rogers T.E. Samson R. Kelman Z. Ibba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26099-26104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic analyses showed that the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km tRNAPro) of ProRS increases 5-fold in this complex compared with the free enzyme, whereas aminoacylation by LeuRS is unchanged. Preliminary investigation of this interaction in cell-free extracts of M. thermautotrophicus suggested that LysRS1 might also associate with the LeuRS·ProRS complex, but these initial findings were not definitive. To further investigate the composition of multi-aaRS complexes in archaea, we have now undertaken a search for proteins that interact with LysRS1. The choice of LysRS1, a primarily archaeal protein, was based upon its proposed presence in multi-aaRS complexes in M. jannaschii and M. thermautotrophicus and its possible role in the assembly of an aminoacylation ternary complex in Methanosarcina barkeri (17Lipman R.S.

LeuRS was found to interact with LysRS1, and the association of these two aaRSs with ProRS was demonstrated in cell-free extracts. These findings, together with in vitro kinetic analyses, indicate the existence of a functional complex of three aaRSs in archaea. Yeast Two-hybrid, Strains, Media, and Plasmid Construction—Yeast transformation was done according to Ref. 20Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar. Yeast media were made according to the manual for the ProQuest two-hybrid system (Invitrogen) and as described (21Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). All of the primers were from Integrated DNA Technologies. The bait vector pDBLeu, prey vector pDEST22 or pPC86, and the yeast host strain MaV203 (MATα leu2-3, 112, trp 1-901, his3Δ200, ade2-101, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, SPAL10::URA3, GAL1::lacZ, HIS3UAS GAL1:: [email protected], can1R, cyh2R) were from the ProQuest two-hybrid system (Invitrogen). The yeast two-hybrid bait vector containing the M. thermautotrophicus lysK gene was constructed as follows. The LysRS encoding gene (lysK, MTH1541) was isolated by PCR using genomic M. thermautotrophicus DNA as template, the primers 5′-GGTG GTGTCGACCATGAAGTTCACACAC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGTGTCGACTCAGGCCTCCAGTCT-3′ flanked by SalI sites and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The lysK PCR product was cloned into PCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and subsequently subcloned into the yeast ProQuest two-hybrid bait vector pDBLeu using the SalI restriction sites. Construction, amplification, and screening of the M. thermautotrophicus cDNA-based yeast two-hybrid library were as previously described (18Praetorius-Ibba M. Rogers T.E. Samson R. Kelman Z. Ibba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26099-26104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid screen was carried out essentially as described in the manual of the ProQuest two-hybrid system (Invitrogen) by sequential or co-transformation of bait and prey vectors. Potential positive protein-protein interacting colonies were identified by growth on selective media (SC lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan) supplemented with 3-aminotriazole (10–25 mm). After rescreening on the same media, bait vectors were isolated from the respective colonies and sequenced. A vector producing an N-terminally tagged His6 fusion derivative of LysRS was prepared by inserting the relevant PCR-amplified gene into the Escherichia coli expression plasmid pET15b (Novagen). For the His6-LysRS construct, forward primer 5′-CATATGAAGTTCACACACTTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGTGGTCTGCAGTCAGGCCTCCAGTCT-3′ were used. Cloning into pET15b was done by isolating the respective NdeI and PstI fragment and ligating it into NdeI- and PstI-digested pET15b. Protein Production and Purification—His6-LeuRS and His6-ProRS were produced and purified as previously described (18Praetorius-Ibba M. Rogers T.E. Samson R. Kelman Z. Ibba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26099-26104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). His6-LysRS was produced by transforming E. coli BL21-RIL (Stratagene) with pET15b-MtlysK. The resulting transformants were grown and induced to produce protein using the Overnight Express Auto-induction System 1 (Novagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cell-free extract was produced by sonication of the cells in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Complete Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) followed by centrifugation at 75,000 × g for 20 min (all of the following procedures were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated). To reduce the amount of contaminating E. coli proteins, the supernatant was incubated at 55 °C for 10 min followed by a brief centrifugation to remove precipitated protein and then ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant from ultracentrifugation was loaded onto a HiPrep 16/10 Q Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A and washed extensively in the same buffer. The His6-LysRS was eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–1 m) in the same buffer. Fractions containing His6-LysRS, as determined by aminoacylation activity, were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon 30; Millipore). The concentrated sample was further purified using gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. Fractions containing His6-LysRS, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and stored at –80 °C. tRNA Purification—M. thermautotrophicus cells, a gift from J. Reeve (The Ohio State University), were used to prepare total tRNA as previously described (19Polycarpo C. Ambrogelly A. Ruan B. Tumbula-Hansen D. Ataide S.F. Ishitani R. Yokoyama S. Nureki O. Ibba M. Söll D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 287-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The total RNA concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically (A260/A280), and individual tRNA acceptor levels were measured in plateau charging reactions (tRNALys = 0.41 pmol/μg; tRNALeu = 0.24 pmol/μg; tRNAPro = 0.40 pmol/μg). Preparation of in vitro transcribed M. thermautotrophicus tRNAPro and tRNALeu was as previously described (18Praetorius-Ibba M. Rogers T.E. Samson R. Kelman Z. Ibba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26099-26104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In vitro transcribed M. thermautotrophicus tRNALys was found to be inactive in aminoacylation assays (data not shown). Co-purification of LeuRS, LysRS, and ProRS—All of the steps were performed at 4 °C. M. thermautotrophicus cells (5 g) were resuspended in buffer A (as above) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Complete Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm N-α-(p-toluene sulfonyl)-l-arginine methyl ester to a final volume of 10 ml. The cells were then passed twice through a French pressure cell, sonicated, and finally centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was then removed and centrifuged for 40 min at 100,000 × g. The resulting cell-free extract was then loaded onto a Sephacryl S300 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated in buffer B (buffer A containing 150 mm KCl) and developed in the same buffer. Fractions containing LeuRS, LysRS, and ProRS activity were pooled and applied to a HiPrep 16/10 Q Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer B, and proteins were eluted with a KCl gradient (0.125–1.125 m) in the same buffer. Size Exclusion Chromatography of aaRSs—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superose 12 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in buffer A containing 200 mm KCl and calibrated using Gel Filtration Standards (Bio-Rad). The samples were prepared in the same buffer as a mixture of 5 μm His6-ProRS, 30 μm His6-LeuRS, and 14 μm His6-LysRS (40 μl of sample volume) and preincubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to injection. The samples were applied at a flow rate of 0.25 ml min–1, and 0.5-ml fractions were then collected. 0.3 ml was then removed from each fraction, and proteins were precipitated with 5 volumes acetone at –80 °C overnight. Precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C; the resulting pellet was dried and finally resuspended in protein gel loading buffer. Aminoacylation Assays—l-[U-14C]Leucine (306 mCi/mmol), l-[U-14C]lysine (312 mCi/mmol), and l-[U-14C]proline (241 mCi/mmol) were all from Amersham Biosciences. A prereaction mixture containing 250 mm KCl, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2,50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 mg/ml M. thermautotrophicus total tRNA, or in vitro transcribed tRNA at the concentrations indicated, and aaRSs at concentrations indicated for specific experiments were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature. The appropriate radiolabeled amino acid was then added to the mixture, and the temperature was increased to 50 °C. After 1 min, 5 mm ATP was added to start the reaction. The aliquots were spotted onto 3MM paper presoaked in 5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) and washed in trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity was counted. For Lys Km determination, l-[14C]-Lys was added at concentrations varying between 0.2 and 3 times Km. For tRNALys Km determination, total tRNA was added to provide final concentrations of tRNALys varying between 0.2 and 3 times the Km. Labeling of M. thermautotrophicus LeuRS—Fluorescent labeling and anisotropy measurements (see below) were based upon previously published procedures (5An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34465-34472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Kovaleski B.J. Kennedy R. Hong M.K. Datta S.A. Kleiman L. Rein A. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol.

A solution of Alexa fluor (AF) 488 tetrafluorophenyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to labeling LeuRS with AF, the protein was desalted using a 1-ml Sephadex G25 spin column (Amersham Biosciences). LeuRS (40 μm) was then combined with AF at a molar ratio of 1:25 in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm KCl and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Excess unreacted dye was immediately removed by passage through a 1-ml Sephadex G25 spin column pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. Traces of dye were then removed from the labeled protein, LeuRS-AF, by dialysis overnight against a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. LeuRS-AF was then applied to a Microcon YM-50 concentrator (Amicon) to remove residual free dye and concentrate the protein. LeuRS-AF was visualized on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to ultraviolet illumination, which confirmed that the final labeled product contained little or no free fluorophore. The final labeling stoichiometry was determined to be 1:1 (LeuRS to fluorophore) based on Equation 1 (as per the manufacturer's protocol). R=A494×dilution factor/ϵ494×Y(Eq. 1) R represents the molar ratio of LeuRS to fluorophore, A494 is the absorbance of labeled protein at 494 nm, ϵ494 is the extinction coefficient of the AF, and Y is the final concentration of LeuRS-AF determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Prior to use in fluorescence anisotropy measurements, the activity of LeuRS-AF was verified by aminoacylation assays, and protein concentrations were determined via active site titration (23Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—The fluorescence anisotropy of LeuRS-AF was measured as a function of increasing concentrations of unlabeled protein to determine equilibrium dissociation constants (KD). Prior to fluorescence anisotropy measurements, 100 nm LeuRS-AF was incubated with varying amounts of unlabeled protein (25–2000 nm LysRS or 25–5500 nm ProRS) for 20 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 125 mm dipotassium glutarate, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured using a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon), with excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 519 nm, respectively, slit widths of 5 nm, and the time-based function for 30 s (integration time = 1 s; resolution = 8 s), and the data were then averaged. All of the measurements were carried out at least three times. The titration curves were fitted to Equation 2, which assumes a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. A=Amin+Y+S+KD-Y+S+KD2-4YS1/2Amax-Amin/2Y(Eq. 2) A is the measured anisotropy at a particular total concentration of unlabeled protein (S) and LeuRS-AF (Y), Amin is the minimum anisotropy, Amax is the maximum anisotropy, and KD is the dissociation constant. Identification of LysRS Interacting Proteins—Approximately 4.1 × 105 transformants were screened for protein-protein interacting phenotypes using the bait vector pDBLeu harboring the M. thermautotrophicus lysK gene and library inserts encoded by the prey vectors pDEST or pPC86. From these transformants, 560 potential positive protein-protein interacting clones were selected and rescreened according to the growth phenotype on selective media supplemented with 3-aminotriazole (Table 1). A total of 133 clones showing growth phenotype similar to the weak or moderate interacting standard (Table 1) were picked, and bait vectors were isolated and subsequently sequenced. The LysRS interacting proteins were then sorted into four classes based upon the predicted function of the corresponding open reading frames (Table 1). An additional group of proteins with no significant similarity to proteins of known function was also identified but was not further pursued in this study.TABLE 1Proteins identified as interacting with M. thermautotrophicus LysRSFunctionORFaOpen reading frames (ORFs) are numbered according to the annotated genome sequence of M. thermautotrophicus (26).DescriptionbPredicted functions of the corresponding proteins are taken from the TIGR Comprehensive Microbial Resource (cmr.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/shared/AnnotationSearch.cgi).MethanogenesisMTH1130Methyl CoM RDase II, γ-subMTH1134Methyl viologen-reducing hydrogenaseMTH1161N5-methyl-tetrahydromethanopterin: CoM methyltransferase, C-subMTH1165Methyl CoM RDase I, γ-subMTH1166Methyl CoM RDase c-subMTH1168Methyl CoM RDase I, β-subMTH1300Co-F420-reducing hydrogenaseMTH1752F420-dependent N5-N10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin reductaseMTH1878CoB-CoM heterodisulfide reductase Fe-S, C-subProtein binding and modificationMTH32Centromere/microtubule-binding proteinMTH357TransglutaminaseMTH412TransglutaminaseMTH678Prefoldin β-subMTH794Chaperonin (thermosome β-sub)OtherMTH810Putative ski2-type helicaseMTH1588Ferripyochelin-binding proteinMTH1913Putative membrane proteinTranslationMTH1508Leucyl-tRNA synthetaseUnknown functionMTH247MTH479MTH545MTH609MTH674MTH1191a Open reading frames (ORFs) are numbered according to the annotated genome sequence of M. thermautotrophicus (26Smith D.R.

Open table in a new tab The largest group of proteins identified as interacting with LysRS in the two-hybrid screen were all involved in different steps of the methanogenesis pathway. Of these, MTH1130, MTH1161, MTH1165, MTH1168, MTH1300, MTH1752, and MTH1878 were all previously identified as false positive clones in two-hybrid screens of the same library using translation factors or DNA-binding proteins as bait (18Praetorius-Ibba M.

Hausmann and M. Ibba, unpublished results. The remaining two clones, MTH1134 and MTH1166, are both very closely related to the other methanogenic proteins identified here and elsewhere as false positives and were not further investigated. The second major group of potential LysRS-associating proteins identified from the two-hybrid screen all have known roles in protein binding and modification. MTH357, MTH412, and MTH794 have all been previously identified as false positive clones (18Praetorius-Ibba M. Rogers T.E. Samson R. Kelman Z. Ibba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26099-26104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 3Z. Kelman, personal communication., 4C. D. Hausmann and M. Ibba, unpublished results. The other two clones, MTH32 and MTH678, both encode proteins expected to bind to different factors in the cell and thus are more likely to act as false positive clones rather than as proteins that specifically bind LysRS. Of the other proteins found to interact with LysRS, MTH1588 and MTH1913 are both normally expected to be membrane-associated, suggesting that their association here with LysRS may be nonspecific. MTH810 is usually found as part of a multimeric complex (24Wang L. Lewis M.S. Johnson A.W. RNA. 2005; 11: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction observed here with LysRS might be nonspecific. The only known component of protein synthesis identified from the two-hybrid screen was LeuRS (Tables 1 and 2). LeuRS has previously been shown to form functional interactions with ProRS both in the human multi-aaRS complex (reviewed in Refs. 11Mirande M. Ibba M. Francklyn C.S. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 298-308Google Scholar and 25Lee S.W. Cho B.H. Park S.G. Kim S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3725-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and in M. thermautotrophicus. LysRS, albeit of the class II rather than archaeal class I type, is also a component of the human multi-aaRS complex, leading us to investigate whether LysRS is associated with ProRS and LeuRS in archaea.TABLE 2Yeast two-hybrid interaction between LeuRS and LysRSPlasmids-Ura-His +25 mm 3-AT+0.2% 5-FOADescriptionA controls--+++No interaction standardB controls-+++Weak interaction standardC controls+/-++Moderate interaction standardD controls++++/-Strong interaction standardpDBleu-lysK/+ pPC86-B55-++/-LeuRS insert in prey vectorpDBleu-proS/+ pPC86-+/-+++Empty prey vector control Open table in a new tab Association of LeuRS with LysRS and ProRS—To investigate the possible interactions between the LeuRS, LysRS, and ProRS proteins in M. thermautotrophicus, the co-purification of the corresponding activities from cell-free extracts was monitored. An S100 fraction was prepared and applied to a gel filtration column, and the collected fractions were tested for LeuRS, LysRS, and ProRS aminoacylation activities in the presence of the corresponding radiolabeled amino acid and M. thermautotrophicus total tRNA. The LeuRS, LysRS, and ProRS activities all eluted together (Fig. 1A), whereas a control aminoacylation activity showed a different elution profile (alanyl-tRNA synthetase; data not shown). Calibration of the column with molecular mass standards indicated that the peak in the three activities corresponded to a molecular mass of ∼200–255 kDa, broadly consistent with a 1:1:1 complex stoichiometry (predicted molecular mass, ∼280 kDa). The fractions eluting between 145 and 200 ml were pooled and applied to an anion exchange column, which was then extensively washed prior to development with a KCl gradient. LeuRS, LysRS, and ProRS again eluted together, this time showing co-activity peaks both early and late in the applied KCl gradient (Fig. 1B), suggesting partial dissociation of the complex under these conditions. Attempts to further co-purify the LysRS·LeuRS·ProRS complex by separately applying the active pools to a cation exchange column were not successful (data not shown). Reconstitution of the putative LysRS·LeuRS·ProRS complex was investigated in vitro using the corresponding recombinant proteins. Following co-incubation of the three proteins at room temperature, the possible formation of a ternary complex was investigated by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2). A peak was observed with"
https://openalex.org/W1985493789,"Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is a key regulatory enzyme in methyl group metabolism. It is abundant in the liver, where it uses excess S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to methylate glycine to N-methylglycine (sarcosine) and produces S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), thereby controlling the methylating potential of the cell. GNMT also links utilization of preformed methyl groups, in the form of methionine, to their de novo synthesis, because it is inhibited by a specific form of folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Although the structure of the enzyme has been elucidated by x-ray crystallography of the apoenzyme and in the presence of the substrate, the location of the folate inhibitor in the tetrameric structure has not been identified. We report here for the first time the crystal structure of rat GNMT complexed with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. In the GNMT-folate complex, two folate binding sites were located in the intersubunit areas of the tetramer. Each folate binding site is formed primarily by two 1-7 N-terminal regions of one pair of subunits and two 205-218 regions of the other pair of subunits. Both the pteridine and p-aminobenzoyl rings are located in the hydrophobic cavities formed by Tyr5, Leu207, and Met215 residues of all subunits. Binding experiments in solution also confirm that one GNMT tetramer binds two folate molecules. For the enzymatic reaction to take place, the N-terminal fragments of GNMT must have a significant degree of conformational freedom to provide access to the active sites. The presence of the folate in this position provides a mechanism for its inhibition. Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is a key regulatory enzyme in methyl group metabolism.

The presence of the folate in this position provides a mechanism for its inhibition. The methylation of nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules in the cells is one of the most important ways of modulating metabolism and development. Each methylation reaction is carried out by a specific enzyme, but all such reactions are dependent on the concentrations of the substrate, AdoMet, 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; GNMT, glycine N-methyltransferase; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; 5-CH3-H4PteGlu, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate monoglutamate; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; PABA, p-aminobenzoic acid. and of the product of the reaction, AdoHcy. That ratio AdoMet/AdoHcy is considered an index of the methylation capacity of the cell (1Cantoni G.L. Richards H.H. Chiang P.K. Usdin E. Borchardt R.T. Creveling C.R. Transmethylation. Elsevier, New York1978: 155-164Google Scholar, 2Clarke S. Banfield K. Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 63-78Google Scholar). One of the key regulatory elements in maintaining the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio is the enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (3Blumenstein J. Williams G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1960; 3: 259-263Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Heady J.E. Kerr S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 69-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme, which catalyzes the methylation of glycine, is considered to be a tool for the removal of an excess of AdoMet when its concentration in the cell is increased (increased dietary methionine). Inactivation of GNMT by missense mutations in human individuals resulted in highly elevated concentrations of AdoMet and methionine in the patient's plasma (5Mudd S.H. Cerone R. Schiaffino M.C. Fantasia A.R. Manniti G. Caruso U. Lorini R. Watkins D. Matiaszuk N. Rosenblatt D.S. Schwahn B. Rozen R. LeGros L. Kotb M. Capdevila A. Luka Z. Finkelstein J.D. Tangerman A. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H.

Genet. 2002; 110: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Model mice with the Gnmt gene completely knocked out have an extremely high concentration of AdoMet and a high ratio of AdoMet/AdoHcy in the liver (7Luka Z. Capdevila A. Mato J.M. Wagner C. Transgenic Res. 2006; 15: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An important finding was made when a major folate-binding protein in rat liver cytosol was identified as GNMT (8Zamierowski M.M. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 933-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Suzuki N. Wagner C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 199: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Cook R.J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3631-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). That discovery immediately raised questions as to how this enzyme operates in the cell in the presence of folate, how GNMT is related to folate metabolism, and what is the biological role of the enzyme. A unique property of GNMT methyltransferase is that it was found that binding of the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate pentaglutamate (5-CH3-H4PteGlu5) inhibits methyltransferase activity of GNMT (11Wagner C. Briggs W.T. Cook R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This confers a special role for the enzyme by which it links the activity of the enzyme in the transfer of preformed methyl groups arising from methionine via AdoMet to the de novo synthesis of methyl groups by way of the folate one-carbon pool. A regulatory scheme was proposed in which GNMT not only maintains the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio but also controls methyl group synthesis (12Balaghi M. Horne D.W. Woodward S.C. Wagner C. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1993; 58: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The structure of the GNMT-folate complex is obviously of great importance, but until now, no such crystal structure was available. The crystal structures of the rat, mouse, and human GNMT apoproteins (13Pattanayek R. Newcomer M.E. Wagner C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Pakhomova S. Luka Z. Grohmann S. Wagner C. Newcomer M.E. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinformat. 2004; 57: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) are known as well as the rat GNMT complexed either with AdoMet or complexed with AdoHcy (15Fu Z. Hu Y. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11985-11993Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Huang Y. Komoto J. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8394-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The overall structures of GNMTs from various species are very similar. All enzymes are tetramers of flat shape with numerous contacts between subunits and lower density in the center of the tetramer (see Fig. 1). Each subunit possesses an active center where AdoMet and glycine are bound deep inside of the globular part of the subunits. The enzymatic reaction starts with the AdoMet binding, which leads to significant conformational changes, especially in the N-terminal parts of each monomer, as shown by crystallization of rat GNMT with AdoMet, AdoMet with acetate anion, and by the kinetic data (16Huang Y. Komoto J. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Takata Y. Huang Y. Komoto J. Yamada T. Konishi K. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8394-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The active centers of GNMT could bind some other compounds as shown in the crystal structures of the human and mouse enzymes, where Tris or citrate molecules from the mother liquors were found (14Pakhomova S. Luka Z. Grohmann S. Wagner C. Newcomer M.E. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinformat. 2004; 57: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). By protein-ligand docking modeling, it was shown that benzopyrene could potentially bind to the active center of GNMT (18Chen S.-Y. Lin J.-R.V. Darbha R. Lin P. Liu T.-Y. Chen Y.-M.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3617-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Does that mean that folates could also bind to the active center, as proposed earlier (15Fu Z. Hu Y. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11985-11993Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)? The crystal structure determination of the folate-GNMT complex now provides insight to the mechanism and specificity of inhibition by folate and its link to one-carbon metabolism in the cell. In this work, we report the crystal structure of rat GNMT complexed with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. GNMT Preparation—All experiments in this work were done with rat GNMT, as this enzyme was discovered as the folate-binding protein in rat liver, and folate binding in vitro has been described for this enzyme (11Wagner C. Briggs W.T. Cook R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structure of the rat enzyme has been relatively well studied (13Pattanayek R. Newcomer M.E. Wagner C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Fu Z. Hu Y. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8394-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Rat GNMT was expressed in E. coli and purified as reported earlier (19Luka Z. Wagner C. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 20: 280-286Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat GNMT cDNA was cloned in pET-17b expression vector and expressed in the BL21(GE3) E. coli strain. After preparation of the crude extract, GNMT was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DE-52 anion exchange chromatography, and Sephacryl S-200 size exclusion chromatography. Protein of 96-98% purity was used for crystallization and other experiments. Folate Binding—All experiments of folate binding and crystallization were done with (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolate monoglutamate ((6S)-5-CH3-H4PteGlu, hereafter referred to as folate) (Fig. 1) from Merck EPROVA AG, Schaffhausen, Switzerland. This derivative of folic acid was used because it is a basic natural form of folate, it is available in large quantities suitable for crystallization studies, and it has been shown to inhibit and bind to the rat liver enzyme (11Wagner C. Briggs W.T. Cook R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Blakley R.L. The Biochemistry of Folic Acid and Related Pteridines. Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1969Google Scholar). Binding to GNMT was measured by a filtration method. The rat enzyme was incubated with folate in 20 mm Tris, 25 mm NaCl, and 5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), pH 7.5, for 1 h. The material was placed into a Microcon YM-10 concentrator (Amicon Bioseparation), and a small volume of the solvent with unbound folate was quickly separated by centrifugation. Concentration of folate in the filtrate [Ffree] was measured by absorbance at 290 nm (maximum for folate at neutral pH) by using a molar extinction coefficient of 3.17 × 104 (21Gupta V.S. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 120: 712-718Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Subtracting the free concentration of folate from the total concentration gave us the concentration of bound folate [Fbound]. The molar ratio of [Fbound]/[GNMTtetr](V), with [GNMTtetr]asa molar concentration of GNMT tetramer, was plotted against [Ffree], and the resulting plot was fitted with the following equation: V = nKA[Ffree]/(1 - KA[Ffree]) (by KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) non-linear fitting algorithm according to Refs. 22Klotz I.M.

A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The n and KA parameters are the total number of ligand molecules bound to GNMT tetramer and an association constant, respectively. Crystallization—The GNMT-folate complex was crystallized by the sitting drop method at room temperature. The protein (4-6 mg/ml concentration in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm TCEP) was incubated with 1-3 mm folate for at least 1 h prior to the crystallization. The protein-folate complex was mixed with the reservoir solution (20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m calcium-acetate). The crystals of the GNMT-folate complex appeared in a few hours and grew to the maximum dimensions in 4-6 days. They belong to the monoclinic P21 space group with a = 57.869, b = 85.223, and c = 131.861 Å and β = 91.40°. Crystals of the GNMT apoprotein were grown from the same conditions, with folate being omitted from the crystallization, and they are isomorphous with the GNMT-folate crystals. X-ray Data Collection—Prior to the data collection, a suitable crystal was dipped for several seconds in a modified mother liquor solution with the addition of 20% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) beamline 22-BM, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, using a MAR 225 CCD detector. The images were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38567) Google Scholar).

A dimer of the rat GNMT (Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession code 1BHJ) was used as the search model. Two dimers, which form a tetramer, were located in the asymmetric unit. The tetramer in the GNMT-folate structure was positioned using the rigid body refinement of the apoGNMT tetramer. The positioned tetrameric models of both the apo- and folate-bound structures were then refined using the maximum likelihood refinement in CNS (25Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry restraints and bulk solvent corrections were applied. The program O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar) was used to build the models throughout the refinement. Refinement statistics for both structures are listed in Table 1. Details of refinement of each of the structures follow. GNMT Apoprotein—The final model consists of residues 2-196, 200-223, and 235-292 of subunit A, residues 1-227 and 235-292 of subunit B, residues 2-223 and 235-292 of subunit C, residues 1-227 and 233-292 of subunit D, two Ca2+ ions, and 115 water molecules. Residues C246 (subunit B) and R53 (subunit D) were modeled in two alternate conformations. The molecules display good stereochemistry with 87.9% of non-glycine residues in the most favored regions of a Ramachandran plot and none in disallowed regions. GNMT-Folate Complex—The difference Fourier map revealed the presence of two folate molecules in the tetramer of GNMT. They were modeled according to the shape of electron density. Their occupancy factor was set to 1. The final model consists of residues 2-196, 200-223, and 235-292 of subunit A, residues 1-227 and 235-292 of subunit B, residues 1-223 and 235-292 of subunit C, residues 1-227 and 233-292 of subunit D, two folates, and 14 water molecules. Similar to the apoprotein, 85.0% of non-glycine residues are in the most favored regions of a Ramachandran plot and none are in disallowed regions. Other Methods—Protein concentration was routinely determined by the BCA method (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. In binding experiments, concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by using an absorbance value of 1.46 for a 0.1% solution at 278 nm in binding conditions. The latter was experimentally determined based on the value of 1.50 predicted from the amino acid composition for solution in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The BCA method gives a concentration 7.7% higher compared with the spectro-photometrically determined value; therefore, the coefficient of 0.929 was used to obtain the correct concentration. Protein purity was determined by standard SDS electrophoresis with scanning of the Coomassie-stained gel on Bio-Rad Gel/Chemi Doc system and Quantity One software. Microbiological assay for folate was done by the Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay according to a published procedure (27Horne D.W. Patterson D. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 2357-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Absorbance spectra were recorded on a double beam Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer. Folate Binding to GNMT—The binding data are presented in Fig. 2 as the dependence of the molar ratio of folate bound to GNMT (tetramer) on the concentration of free folate [Ffree]. Fitting the data by the equation described under “Folate Binding” gave the value of the ratio of [Fbound]/[GNMTtetr] = 2 (1.944). That means that one molecule of GNMT tetramer binds two molecules of folate. The value of the association constant KA was calculated to be 3.42 × 105 × m-1 (or 2.9 μm for KD). The latter means that crystallization experiments should be performed at a millimolar concentration of folate to follow a general suggestion to use a ligand concentration of 1000-fold higher than KD. Crystallization—The major requirements for crystallization conditions were to maintain a pH of >7 for effective folate binding to GNMT in the ionization state similar to physiologic conditions and the presence of reducing agent to prevent oxidative degradation of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu. Several crystallization conditions were found to be favorable for GNMT-folate complex crystal growth. The best crystals were obtained in the presence of calcium-acetate in 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 (Fig. 3A) and a folate concentration of 1-3 mm with 5 mm TCEP. In those conditions, crystals of GNMT-folate complex appeared in hours. The shape of the crystals for the complex was as shown in Fig. 3A. One of the critical points of this work was obtaining crystals of GNMT apoprotein grown under the same conditions as for the GNMT-folate complex. Such crystals give the best comparison of crystal structures of the folate-free protein and the GNMT-folate complex, avoiding any question of potential effects of different components of the precipitants and buffers. The latter was of special importance, because GNMT is known for its ability to trap some components of the crystallization media (14Pakhomova S. Luka Z. Grohmann S. Wagner C. Newcomer M.E. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinformat. 2004; 57: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In most cases, the apoprotein crystals were grown in the form of tiny needles not suitable for data collection (Fig. 3B). However, in two drops in calcium-acetate, two plate-shaped crystals of GNMT apoprotein grew to a relatively large size. The presence of folate in the GNMT-folate complex crystals was confirmed by microbiological assay (27Horne D.W. Patterson D. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 2357-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the presence of folate in the GNMT-folate crystals was an observation that crystals, after five months of storage in mother liquor, became yellow- and red-colored, and the intensity of the color increased over time, yet the mother liquor remained clear (Fig. 3C). None of the crystals of GNMT without folate became colored, even after storage for a year in the mother liquor. The red color could be explained by a shift of the absorbance spectra to >400 nm due to folate oxidation to a still unidentified “red product” (28Thomas A.H. Suarez G. Cabrerizo F.M. Capparelli A.L. Helv. Chim. Acta. 2001; 84: 3849-3860Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29Thomas A.H. Suarez G. Cabrerizo F.M. Einschlag F.S.G. Martino R. Baiocchi C. Pramauro E. Capparelli A.L. Helv. Chim. Acta. 2002; 85: 2300-2315Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). None of the GNMT-folate complex crystals were used for data collection later than one week after crystal growth initiation. Overall Structures—The asymmetric unit in the folate-free as well as the GNMT-folate complex is represented by a tetramer in a so-called closed conformation. Important features of that structure are the positions of the N-terminal fragments of the subunits, which were found interacting with residues of the entrance into the active center of the adjacent subunits (16Huang Y. Komoto J. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Takata Y. Huang Y. Komoto J. Yamada T. Konishi K. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8394-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The overall conformation did not change upon folate binding. Folate-free and folate-bound structures are very similar, with root mean square deviations of 0.738 Å over the 1129 equivalent CA atoms. In addition, flexible parts of the protein molecules (parts of protein model for which no electron density has been observed) are almost identical and similar to those found in the structures of human and mouse GNMTs (14Pakhomova S. Luka Z. Grohmann S. Wagner C. Newcomer M.E. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinformat. 2004; 57: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Despite a very similar overall structure, there are some differences. An important one is a difference in the conformations of Tyr5 residues, especially Tyr5 (A) and Tyr5 (D). In the GNMT-folate complex, those tyrosine residues play an important role in folate binding. Localizing the Folate Binding Sites—The principal goal of this work was to localize the folate binding sites in the rat GNMT. Difference Fourier electron density map contoured at 4 σ for the GNMT-folate complex revealed the presence of two areas of additional electron density located in the inter-subunit area (Fig. 4A). The shape of the density was consistent with a folate molecule. On the contrary, no additional electron density has been observed in the same area for the apoprotein (Fig. 4B). Because the binding experiment showed that the GNMT tetramer binds two folate molecules, it was concluded that the additional electron density originated from folate. Folate Conformation—Folates and their derivatives exist in complexes with proteins in different conformations with different relative orientation of the pteridine ring, p-aminobenzoyl (PABA) group, and glutamate residue(s), which depend on the specific folate-protein interactions (30Poe M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Cody V. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Gangjee A. Queener S.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 646-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Two general conformations of folates were found. The most abundant one is the bent conformation, as found in dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes (32Matthews D.A. Alden R.A. Bolin J.T. Freer S.T. Hamlin R. Xuong N. Kraut J. Poe M. Williams M. Hoogsteen K. Science. 1977; 197: 452-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In crystal structures of enzymes with 5-CH3-H4PteGlu and with 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5, some contain folate in the bent conformation, whereas others contain folate in the extended form (32Matthews D.A. Alden R.A. Bolin J.T. Freer S.T. Hamlin R. Xuong N. Kraut J. Poe M. Williams M. Hoogsteen K. Science. 1977; 197: 452-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 33Hyatt D.C. Maley F.

The best assignment of the folate in the electron density in the GNMT-folate complex was achieved when the folate was built in almost extended conformation as shown in Fig. 5. Folate-Protein Interactions—The folate conformation is supported by specific folate-GNMT interactions. The interaction of folate with the GNMT protein moiety followed the general rule for the folate-protein interaction; the pteridine and p-aminobenzoyl rings were buried into the more hydrophobic interior of the protein with the glutamate tail exposed to the surface of the protein globule. The characteristic feature of folate-GNMT binding is that the folate binding sites are located in very specific parts of the quaternary structure of GNMT in the intersubunit areas. As shown in Fig. 5, binding site 1 is located between subunits B and D in the cavity formed by two interacting parts of all four subunits, two β-sheets formed by residues Ser205-Thr218 (B) and Ser205-Thr218 (D) on the one side and two N-terminal fragments including residues Asp2-Thr7 (A) and Val1-Thr7 (C) on the other side. Binding site 2 is related by 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry to site 1 and is located between subunits A and C. This site is formed by similar elements of the polypeptide chains as for binding site 1, two β-sheets formed by residues of Ser205-Thr218 (A) and Ser205-Thr218 (C) and two N-terminal fragments Val1-Thr7 (B) and Val1-Thr7 (D). The specific interactions are shown in Fig. 6 and in Table 2 for binding site 1, having in mind that similar interactions exist in the site 2. Folate molecules are stabilized inside of a tetramer by mainly hydrophobic interactions with only one hydrogen bond observed. Such a feature explains the relatively high B-factors of folates, which are 1.5 times higher than the average B-factors of protein molecules (Table 1). Within a distance of 4.0 Å from the folate there are residues Ser3 (C), Tyr5 (A, C), Thr7 (C), Leu207 (B, D), His214 (D), Met215 (B, D), and Arg239 (B). The hydrophobic pocket of binding site 1 is formed primarily by Tyr5, Leu207, His214, and Met215 residues (Table 2).TABLE 25-CH3-H4PteGlu - GNMT interactions5-CH3-H4-PteGluGNMT atom/group-residues (subunit)DistanceÅPteridineC4CB-Ser3 (C)3.68C6CE-Met215 (B)3.69C7CD2-Leu207 (B)2.91C7CD1-Tyr5 (C)3.265-CH3CB-Tyr5 (C)3.535-CH3CG2-Thr7 (A)3.41PABAC12CB, CG-Tyr5 (A)3.44, 3.46C13CB, CG-Tyr5 (A)3.38, 3.88C17CD2-Leu207 (D)3.88CONH2-Arg239 (B)3.59Glutamateα-COOS-Met215 (D)3.10, 3.25α-COOND1-His214 (D)3.41γ-COOHO-Tyr5 (A), H-bond3.19 (3.0 in site 2)CACZ-Tyr5 (A)3.68CBCZ-Tyr5 (A)3.11 Open table in a new tab The pteridine ring interacts with the protein mainly by hydrophobic contacts. There are numerous such contacts (a total of 15 as determined by the Ligand Explorer program (36Moreland J.L. Gramada A. Buzko O.V. Zhang Q. Bourne P.E. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar)) that involve Tyr5 (C) with close contact to C7 of the pteridine, the methyl groups of Leu207 (B), which are at a distance of 2.9 Å from C7 pteridine and others as shown in Table 2. The 5-methyl group of folate is directed into a hydrophobic cavity of GNMT with the closest distance to the methyl group of Thr7 (A) (3.4 Å) and the methylene group of Tyr5 (C) (3.5 Å). The PABA moiety of folate is placed in the most hydrophobic part of the binding site (with 19 hydrophobic contacts) as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2. Tyr5 (A) and Leu207 (D) give the main yield in hydrophobic interactions with PABA (17 contacts). There is also a possibility for polar interaction, because the NH2 group of Arg239 (B) is a distance of 3.6 Å from the group of PABA. The glutamate part of the folate participates in the most specific interactions with protein. The only hydrogen bond between folate and protein is established between the γ-carboxyl group of glutamate and the hydroxyl group of Tyr5 (A) with a distance of 3.2 Å (Fig. 6) (3.0 Å in site 2). The α-carboxyl group is involved in interaction with the sulfur atom of Met215 (D) with a distance between oxygens and sulfur atoms of 3.10 and 3.25 Å. Interestingly, there are also 13 hydrophobic contacts of glutamate with Tyr5, Leu207, and His214. Glycine N-methyltransferase is a major liver regulatory enzyme that plays a key role in maintaining one of the most important cell parameters, the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio, often referred to as the methylation index. In cases when GNMT was inactivated by missense mutations in humans (5Mudd S.H. Cerone R. Schiaffino M.C. Fantasia A.R. Manniti G. Caruso U. Lorini R. Watkins D. Matiaszuk N. Rosenblatt D.S.

Genet. 2002; 110: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or completely knocked out by gene targeting in mice (7Luka Z. Capdevila A. Mato J.M. Wagner C. Transgenic Res. 2006; 15: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the concentrations of critically important metabolites, methionine, and AdoMet in human plasma and in mice liver were extremely high. The latter leads to damage of the liver and liver disease. GNMT is also a major liver cytosolic folate-binding protein. Its high abundance in the liver (4Heady J.E. Kerr S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 69-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) results in the major portion (if not all) of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate tightly bound to GNMT (8Zamierowski M.M. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 933-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that GNMT is abundant in other tissues, e.g. in the pancreas, prostate, and kidney. Binding of and inhibition by folate is a key part of the mechanism of control of the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio during the lifetime of the organism. The crystal structure of the GNMT-folate complex we are reporting here gives insight into the mechanism of that regulation. How is GNMT inhibited by folate? The crystal structure of GNMT complexed with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate revealed that bound folate does not directly interfere with binding of AdoMet by competing for the active center. AdoMet is bound to the active site on each subunit deep into the monomer globule as shown earlier (Fig. 1) (15Fu Z. Hu Y. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11985-11993Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Huang Y. Komoto J. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8394-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The AdoMet binding mechanism deduced from the crystal structure of rat GNMT with AdoMet indicated that the N-terminal domain of each subunit had moved out of the position where it was blocking the entrance to the active site of the adjacent subunit. The N-terminal fragments then became exposed to solvent (17Takata Y. Huang Y. Komoto J. Yamada T. Konishi K. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8394-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As a result of those rearrangements of the N-terminal fragments of GNMT, the cavities for folate binding are not formed and folate cannot bind to GNMT when the active sites are occupied with AdoMet. The data presented here show explicitly that, when folate is already bound to GNMT, the N-terminal fragments are bound to folate and their move from the protein globule into the solvent to gain access for AdoMet requires much higher concentrations of AdoMet compared with apoprotein. Inhibition experiments (37Yeo E.-J. Briggs W.T. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) support this mechanism. It was found that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate pentaglutamate inhibited rat GNMT efficiently if it was incubated with protein prior to the addition of AdoMet and other components of the reaction mixture. Obviously, this situation was a result of the difference in the binding constants for AdoMet and folate and the energy required for protein conformational changes that accompany the exposure of the N-terminal parts of the monomers from the globule into the solvent. It should be noted that these earlier experiments indicated that there was only a single molecule of folate bound per tetramer. They were carried out using fluorescence determination of the free and total bound folate, and the calculation employed Scatchard analysis, a much less rigorous procedure. In addition, the form of folate used in these earlier studies was the pentaglutamate. It is possible, but unlikely, that the different result was because of the length of the polyglutamate chain. Localization of the folate binding sites in the rat GNMT is important in understanding the mechanism of inhibition of this enzyme by folate, which is responsible for regulating the methylation status of the cell. The data presented here are likely valid for GNMT from other sources. All residues participating in folate binding in the rat GNMT are invariant in the protein sequences of GNMTs from rat, human, rabbit, pig, and mouse (14Pakhomova S. Luka Z. Grohmann S. Wagner C.

The minichromosome maintenance helicase from the archaeon Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus required only ATP to unwind DNA bound into complexes by the M. thermautotrophicus archaeal histone HMtA2, transcription repressor TrpY, or into a transcription pre-initiation complex by M. thermautotrophicus TATA-box-binding protein, transcription factor B, and RNA polymerase.

DNA is bound in vivo into complexes by many different proteins, most of which presumably must be displaced to facilitate DNA replication. As DNA helicases are located at the front of the replication machinery, they seem likely to participate in displacing such proteins from DNA, and consistent with this, a number of helicases have been shown to be capable of displacing proteins from DNA.

The reduced complexity of the archaeal systems makes them attractive for experimental investigation, both as inherently interesting systems in their own right and as simpler models directly relevant to understanding eukaryotic DNA replication and transcription. With this in mind, we have established robust in vitro DNA- and RNA-synthesizing systems using purified archaeal components that originate from Methano-thermobacter thermautotrophicus and have begun to investigate their regulation (13.Kelman L.M.

In structure and DNA constraining properties, archaeal nucleosomes closely resemble eukaryotic tetrasomes, the structure formed at the center of the eukaryotic nucleosome, where DNA is wrapped around eukaryotic (H3+H4)2 histone tetramer (18.Alilat M. Sivolob A. Revet B. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 815-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It was previously established that the presence of an archaeal histone slowed but did not block transcript elongation by M. thermautotrophicus RNA polymerase (19.Xie Y. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3492-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The experiments reported here were undertaken first to determine whether movement of the M. thermautotrophicus MCM helicase, the leading component of the archaeal DNA replication machinery, was also sensitive to the presence of an archaeal nucleosome. After establishing that DNA unwinding by the archaeal MCM helicase was not prevented by the presence of an archaeal nucleosome formed by HMtA2, a histone from M. thermautotrophicus, experiments were undertaken to determine whether the archaeal helicase could also unwind the strands of a DNA molecule bound by a M. thermautotrophicus transcription regulator (TrpY), transcription pre-initiation complex, or stalled transcript-elongating complex (14.Xie Y.

The results obtained demonstrate that the archaeal MCM helicase requires only ATP to unwind DNA bound by an archaeal histone, TrpY, and transcription pre-initiation complexes but has only minimal ability to disassemble a transcription elongation complex. Reagents−Labeled and unlabeled nucleotides were purchased from GE Healthcare and streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads from Promega (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides (see Fig. 1) were synthesized by the DNA facility at the Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology, University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (Rockville, MD) or purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Purification of M. thermautotrophicus Proteins−The procedures and assays used to purify the M. thermautotrophicus MCM helicase, MCM (K324A) variant, TrpY, HMtA2, TATA-box-binding protein (TBP), transcription factor B (TFB), and RNA polymerase (RNAP), and the properties of these purified proteins have been described previously (14.Xie Y.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Helicase Substrates−Helicase substrates, with the sequences shown in Fig. 1, were generated by complementary oligonucleotide hybridization and purified as described previously (22.Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49053-49062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One DNA strand of each substrate was 5′ endlabeled (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 1) by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Complexes were generated by incubation of the appropriate DNA (0.2 pmol) with HMtA2 (5 pmol) or TrpY (20 pmol) in 20 μl of helicase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) or with RNAP (1 pmol), TFB (0.2 pmol) and TFB (0.2 pmol) in 20 μl of transcription buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, and 120 mm KCl) at 60 °C for 10 min. MCM Helicase Assays−Reaction mixtures (15 μl) contained 10 fmol of 32P-labeled DNA substrate (∼30,000 cpm), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, 5 mm ATP, and MCM as indicated in the figure legends. Samples were taken after increasing times of incubation at 60 °C and helicase activity terminated by addition of 5 μl of gel loading buffer (100 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 50% glycerol). The products were separated by electrophoresis at 22 °C through non-denaturing gels that contained 4-8% polyacrylamide depending on the DNA substrate. After electrophoresis for 1.5 h at 200 V in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 8), the locations and abundance of 32P-labeled molecules were determined by phosphorimaging (GE Healthcare). Helicase activity calculations were based on the amount of single-stranded DNA generated when proteins were not present or by the reduction in a protein-bound substrate. Assay of Helicase Disruption of Elongation Complexes−Transcription pre-initiation complexes, assembled as described above with 5′-biotinylated DNA substrates, were incubated at 60 °C for 15 min with 200 μm ATP, 200 μm GTP, 10 μm CTP, and 1 μCi [α-32P]CTP/μl added to allow initiation and transcript elongation to the end of the U-less cassette (at position 25). The resulting complexes were diluted (final concentration of 0.66 nm) in helicase buffer (24 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 24 mm sodium acetate, 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml) and incubated with MCM helicase, with or without 5 mm ATP, at 60 °C for 32 min before being transferred to 23 °C. The M. thermautotrophicus MCM helicase is active at 60 °C but not at 23 °C, whereas the elongation complexes are stable at both temperatures (15.Santangelo T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Washed streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads were added to each sample, and after incubation with gentle agitation for 10 min, the beads were removed to obtain pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions. The nucleic acids present in both fractions were purified, dissolved in 95% formamide in TBE (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8)), 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and separated by electrophoresis for 3 h at 1.5 kV through 15% polyacrylamide gels that contained 8 m urea run in TBE (15.Santangelo T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The locations and quantities of the 32P-labeled transcripts present were determined by phosphorimaging. The M. thermautotrophicus MCM helicase was shown previously to have the ability to remove streptavidin molecules from biotinylated DNA (22.Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49053-49062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 1 protein from DNA. 5J.-H. Shin and Z. Kelman, unpublished results. The experiments described below were undertaken to determine whether this archaeal enzyme could unwind DNA bound by proteins that it would encounter naturally during replication of the M. thermautotrophicus genome. Archaeal Histone Binding Does Not Inhibit MCM Helicase Activity−The genome of M. thermautotrophicus is bound and compacted by archaeal histones in vivo into archaeal nucleosomes (17.Pereira S.L. Grayling R.A. Lurz R. Reeve J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12633-12637Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The ability of the MCM helicase to unwind DNA bound by HMtA2, the most abundant archaeal histone in M. thermautotrophicus, was therefore determined using a DNA substrate that contained a 60 bp of sequence (designated Selex1; Fig. 1A) to which HMtA2 binds with high affinity and assembles to form a positioned archaeal nucleosome (19.Xie Y. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3492-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A and quantified in Fig. 2B, the MCM helicase generated single-stranded DNA from this substrate equally efficiently when the DNA was protein-free or bound by HMtA2 into an archaeal nucleosome (Fig. 2A, lanes 3-5 and 7-9, respectively). This substrate DNA was not unwound by the MCM (K324A) mutant that lacked helicase activity (Fig. 2A, lane 11) or in reaction mixtures that did not contain ATP (Fig. 2A, lane 10). Time course experiments confirmed that the rate and extent of substrate unwinding were essentially the same, and that unwinding by the MCM helicase occurred with no apparent delay when the DNA was bound by HMtA2 or was supplied as protein-free DNA (Fig. 2, C and D). TrpY Binding Slows but Does Not Block Helicase Activity−In contrast to HMtA2 that, as a histone, makes contacts primarily with the sugar-phosphate backbone (23.Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 241-260Crossref Scopus (6842) Google Scholar) and binds to essentially all DNA sequences, TrpY is a M. thermautotrophicus transcription repressor that binds specifically to TRP-box sequences (consensus TGTACA) that are located upstream of the trpY, trpEGCFBAD, and trpB2 genes in the M. thermautotrophicus genome (14.Xie Y. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A helicase substrate was therefore constructed that contained the regulatory region, including the four TRP-box sequences, from upstream of the M. thermautotrophicus trpEGCFBAD operon (Fig. 1B), and the ability of the MCM helicase to unwind this DNA was assayed when protein-free and when bound by TrpY (Fig. 3). TrpY binding did not inhibit DNA unwinding (Fig. 3, A and B) but appeared to reduce the initial rate of unwinding (Fig. 3, C and D). However, after ∼15 min at 60 °C, the rate of DNA unwinding was essentially the same with or without TrpY present, consistent with TrpY binding presenting a transient barrier to MCM helicase activity. The TrpY-bound substrate was not unwound by the MCM (K324A) mutant that lacked helicase activity (Fig. 3A, lane 11) or in reaction mixtures that did not contain ATP (Fig. 3A, lane 10). Archaeal Pre-initiation Transcription Complexes Do Not Block MCM Helicase Activity−Transcription pre-initiation complexes containing the archaeal general transcription factors TBP and TFB and archaeal RNAP assemble spontaneously when incubated with DNA that contains an archaeal promoter and the downstream site of transcription initiation (12.Reeve J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). DNA helicase substrates were therefore constructed with the promoter for the hmtB gene from M. thermautotrophicus positioned to direct transcription initiation at the start of a 25 bp of U-less cassette (Fig. 1, C and D) (14.Xie Y. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15.Santangelo T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These substrates were incubated with M. thermautotrophicus TBP, TFB, and RNAP to assemble transcription pre-initiation complexes. Pre-initiation complexes spontaneously isomerize under these conditions to yield an open complex, with the two DNA strands separated from approximately -3to +8, relative to the site of initiation (+1), to form a transcription bubble.6 The ability of the MCM helicase to unwind this DNA when bound into pre-initiation complexes (Fig. 4) was determined when the directions of helicase movement and transcription were the same (co-direction; Fig. 4, A-D) and opposite (head-on direction; Fig. 4, E-H). Within a pre-initiation complex, there are specific TFB-DNA, TBP-DNA, and limited RNAP-DNA contacts upstream of the site of transcription initiation, extensive RNAP-template strand DNA contacts within the main channel of RNAP, and extensive RNAP-DNA and limited TFB-DNA contacts downstream of the site of initiation (24.Bartlett M.S. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5894-5903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25.Renfrow M.B. Naryshkin N. Lewis L.M. Chen H.T. Ebright R.H. Scott R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2824-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Given this organization, when the direction of helicase unwinding and transcription were the same, helicase would first approach and presumably be required to disrupt TFB-DNA contacts, whereas helicase unwinding in the direction opposite to transcription would presumably first encounter the interactions of RNAP with down-stream DNA. In the absence of transcription factors, the MCM helicase unwound both the co-direction and head-on substrates efficiently (Fig. 4, A and E, lanes 3-6). The rate and extent of unwinding was reduced, but not prevented, by the presence of a pre-initiation complex, oriented in either the same (Fig. 4, A-D) or opposite (Fig. 4, E-H) direction to helicase movement. Neither of the substrates was unwound by the MCM (K324A) mutant that lacked helicase activity (Fig. 4, A and E, lanes 7 and 13). An Archaeal Transcription Elongation Complex Blocks MCM Helicase Activity−Transcription elongation complexes that contain a nascent transcript, RNAP, and template DNA are very stable in vitro, and if disrupted, do not reassemble. Elongation complexes that contain M. thermautotrophicus RNAP and a nascent transcript stalled because of nucleotide deprivation remain intact for many hours (15.Santangelo T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The ability of the MCM helicase to disrupt such complexes was investigated using DNA templates on which the helicase would unwind the DNA in the same (co-direction) and opposite (head-on) direction to RNAP movement. A 5′-biotin moiety was attached to the non-template strand of the co-directional substrate (Fig. 1C) and to the template strand of the head-on substrate (Fig. 1D) to facilitate the removal of the DNA and any DNA-containing complexes from solution by binding to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Both substrates were rapidly unwound by the MCM helicase in the absence of transcription factors (results not shown) demonstrating that the presence of a 5′-biotin molecule had no detrimental effect on the helicase activity. For these experiments, the substrate DNA was not labeled but was incubated with TFB, TBP, RNAP, ATP, GTP, CTP, and [α-32P]CTP to obtain elongation complexes in which a stalled 32P-labeled U-less transcript was present. The presence of the RNAP, stalled at the end of the 25 bp of U-less cassette, sterically prevented any additional initiation events. If such elongation complexes were disrupted by exposure to the MCM helicase, the 32P-labeled transcript and RNAP would be released from the DNA and would remain in solution after removal of the DNA by attachment to streptavidin coated beads (I in the scheme on top of Fig. 5). In the absence of UTP, stalled elongation complexes were obtained using both DNA substrates but, whereas most of the complexes formed on the co-directional substrate contained a 25 nt transcript (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2), most of the complexes formed on the head-on substrate contained a 21 nt transcript (Fig. 5, lanes 15 and 16). The 21 nt transcript resulted from transcription to 25 followed by RNAP back-tracking and nascent transcript cleavage (data not shown), presumably resulting from an unfavorable interaction of the stalled elongation complex with the downstream forked DNA. In control experiments, the stalled 21 and 25 nt transcripts were extended beyond 25 when UTP was added (data not shown) and were totally removed from solution when the elongation complexes were incubated with paramagnetic beads (Fig. 5, lanes 3, 5, 17, and 19; pellet (P) fractions), consistent with being present in complexes that contained the RNAP and substrate DNA. Incubation with the MCM helicase and ATP had no significant disruptive effect on the elongation complexes formed on either substrate (Fig. 5, lanes 7-12 and 21-26). The MCM helicase from the archaeon M. thermautotrophicus has the ability to unwind DNA bound by a variety of different M. thermautotrophicus proteins when provided with ATP. Most notably, HMtA2 histone wrapping of DNA into an archaeal nucleosome had virtually no detrimental effect on the extent or rate at which the MCM unwound the histone-bound DNA (Fig. 2). This seems particularly significant given that archaeal histones are sufficiently abundant in M. thermautotrophicus to package most, if not all, of the 1.7 Mbp genome into archaeal nucleosomes (17.Pereira S.L. Grayling R.A. Lurz R. Reeve J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12633-12637Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The helical structure of double-stranded DNA is essential for histone-DNA interaction (23.Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 241-260Crossref Scopus (6842) Google Scholar), and as the advancing helicase generates single-stranded DNA, these interactions will be lost resulting in histone-DNA complex disassembly and allowing unimpeded MCM progress. DNA unwinding by eukaryotic helicases presumably also generates single-stranded DNA that destabilizes eukaryotic histone-DNA binding, but whereas archaeal histones bind DNA only through histone fold contacts, eukaryotic histones also bind DNA through histone tail residues. It seems likely that histone tail acetylation first reduces the affinity of the eukaryotic histone tail regions for DNA (8.Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) before the approach of the eukaryotic helicase disassembles the nucleosome core. Intriguingly, the human MCM helicase is associated with a histone acetyltransferase (9.Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and acetylation of histone tail lysine residues is thought to contribute substantially to reducing histone-DNA affinity (8.Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). DNA unwinding by the archaeal MCM helicase was not blocked by the TrpY repressor or by a pre-initiation complex, although the presence of these transcription factors on the substrate DNA did marginally reduce the rate and extent of unwinding. In contrast, in >90% of cases, the presence of a stalled transcription elongation complex blocked helicase unwinding of the DNA. This is consistent with the report that the bacteriophage T4 replication machinery paused transiently in head-on collisions with a transcription complex, although pausing was not observed when the collision was co-directional (26.Liu B. Alberts B.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Head-on collisions of the E. coli DNA replication and transcription machineries have been reported to reduce replication fork movement in vivo (27.French S. Science. 1992; 248: 1362-1365Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28.Mirkin E.V. Mirkin S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 24: 888-895Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). All seven rRNA operons in the E. coli genome are oriented such that transcription and replication occur in the same direction, presumably to facilitate disassembly of transcription complexes during replication. Studies with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis have similarly shown that the eukaryotic DNA replication machinery transiently stalls in vivo in head-on but not in co-directional collisions with RNAP (29.Deshpande A.M. Newlon C.S. Science. 1996; 272: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 30.Wiesendanger B. Lucchini R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5038-5046Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results argue that a full replication fork, rather than an isolated helicase, may be required to disrupt transcription elongation complexes and/or that additional cellular factors may exist that facilitate removal of elongation complexes to allow passage of the replication fork. Most bacterial and eukaryotic transcription termination factors are known to follow and attack from upstream of an elongating complex, consistent with disruption being most effective in co-directional interactions. The results reported demonstrate that the M. thermautotrophicus MCM alone does have inherent ability to unwind protein-DNA complexes, but it is almost certain that in vivo this enzyme is part of a much larger replication complex (31.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication.2nd Ed. W.H. Freeman, New York, NY1992Google Scholar) that has the added ability to displace transcription factors and RNAP from DNA. Helicase activities have, in fact, been shown to be stimulated by the presence of DNA polymerases (32.Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 33.Stano N.M. Jeong Y.J. Donmez I. Tummalapalli P. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Nature. 2005; 435: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and the observed interactions of MCM with RNAP in eukaryotes (34.Holland L. Gauthier L. Bell-Rogers P. Yankulov K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5192-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35.Yankulov K. Todorov I. Romanowski P. Licatalosi D. Cilli K. Mc-Cracken S. Laskey R. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6154-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) may also aid helicase unwinding of RNAP-bound DNA. It seems most likely that the ability of the archaeal helicase to unwind DNA bound by an archaeal histone, TrpY, and the transcription initiation complex and its inability to unwind the DNA in an elongation complex reflects the differences in the stabilities of these protein-DNA complexes. DNA binding by TrpY, archaeal histones, and the initiation components is inherently dynamic, and their transient dissociations from the DNA substrate may provide the helicase with access and adequate opportunity to unwind the DNA. In contrast, elongation complexes are extremely stable with the RNAP bound to the DNA through many contacts and a tightly packed RNA-DNA hybrid positioned and bound within the RNAP active site (36.Arndt K.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 79-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). All archaeal MCM helicases putatively identified to date have very similar sequences, and those investigated directly have very similar activities, processivities, and DNA binding abilities. It seems likely that all of these archaeal enzymes will have the ATP-dependent inherent ability to unwind archaeal histone- and transcription factor-bound DNA established here for the M. thermautotrophicus MCM helicase. However, not all Archaea have histones, and some have both archaeal histones and one or more members of several non-histone archaeal chromatin protein families such as HTa, Sul7d, Sso10a, Sso10b (Alba), and MC1 (12.Reeve J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The helicases in these Archaea must therefore also have the ability to unwind DNA bound into the variety of different protein-DNA complexes formed by these non-histone genome-compacting proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1969318940,"The homeodomain protein TGIF functions as a negative modulator for multiple classes of transcription factors. Loss of function mutations in a single copy of TGIF result in holoprosencephaly, a developmental anomaly leading to severe forebrain and craniofacial malformations. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations disrupt the functions of TGIF remain to be elucidated. Here we show that a holoprosencephaly mutation (P63R) interferes with the ability of TGIF to act as a corepressor for c-Jun and Smad2, suggesting that this holoprosencephaly mutation may lead to a general defect in the TGIF protein. In fact, we observed that the P63R mutation affects folding of the TGIF protein, resulting in the disruption of the diffuse nuclear staining pattern characteristic of wild-type (WT) TGIF and the accumulation of TGIF in nuclear aggregates. We also show that the mutant TGIF.P63R is degraded more rapidly when compared with WT TGIF and that this degradation occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we observed that TGIF.P63R homodimerizes with WT TGIF to sequester it into nuclear aggregates and to enhance its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. These results reveal an important mechanism for the degradation of TGIF through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, whose deregulation might contribute to the development of human holoprosencephaly."
https://openalex.org/W1996505376,"The cAMP receptor protein (CRP) of Escherichia coli exists in an equilibrium between active and inactive forms, and the effector, cAMP, shifts that equilibrium to the active form, thereby allowing DNA binding. For this equilibrium shift, a C-helix repositioning around the C-helix residues Thr-127 and Ser-128 has been reported as a critical local event along with proper β4/β5 positioning. Here we show that another C-helix residue, Arg-123, has a unique role in cAMP-dependent CRP activation in two different ways. First, Arg-123 is important for proper cAMP affinity, although it is not critical for the conformational change with saturating amounts of cAMP. Second, Arg-123 is optimal for stabilizing the inactive conformation of CRP when cAMP is absent, thereby allowing a maximal range of regulation by cAMP. However, Arg-123 does not appear to be critical for a functional response to cAMP, as has been proposed previously (Berman, H. M., Ten Eyck, L. F., Goodsell, D. S., Haste, N. M., Korney, A., and Taylor, S. S. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 45–50).

CRP is a classic allosteric protein, each subunit of which is composed of two distinct domains connected by a hinge region; this is, an N-terminal effector binding domain and a C-terminal DNA binding domain (4Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). cAMP binding to the effector binding domain triggers a conformational change in the protein that leads to a precise repositioning of the DNA binding domains that promotes binding to its target DNA sequence. CRP exists in equilibrium between an active form that can bind specific DNA target sequences and an inactive form that cannot. In this view, cAMP binding to the protein shifts the equilibrium toward the active form either by destabilizing the inactive form or by stabilizing the active form. Although an enormous amount is known about the behavior of the DNA binding form of CRP, relatively less is known about the process of activation by cAMP binding. The critical obstacle has been the absence of a crystal structure of the cAMP-free form, although several structures of active CRP are known both in the presence and absence of DNA (4Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 5McKay D.B. Steitz T.A.

A number of research groups have used other methods to better understand the cAMP-dependent activation of CRP protein (3Harman J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We have also contributed to this field by identifying two distinctive local effects of cAMP binding in the activation process (7Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); (i) C-helix repositioning through direct interaction of cAMP with two C-helix residues Thr-127 and Ser-128 and (ii) the concomitant reorientation of the β4/β5 loop. Recently another group compared the structures of a large number of cAMP-binding proteins of quite diverse function (8Berman H.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Goodsell D.S. Haste N.M. Korney A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). They showed that despite large functional differences there were underlying structural similarities in both cAMP sensing and cAMP response. One of these conserved functions concerns a residue that they proposed should serve as an allosteric trigger of cAMP sensing. The homologous residue in CRP of E. coli is Arg-123. More specifically, these authors noted that a hydrophobic sandwich for cAMP is formed by Arg-123 and Val-49, and they posited that Arg-123 would be critical for cAMP response. Not surprisingly, this residue has been examined before. Moore et al. (9Moore J. Kantorow M. Vanderzwaag D. McKenney K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8030-8035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) made several substitutions at those positions and showed that some of these variants were unable to function in vivo, whereas others had a weak response in the presence of cAMP (9Moore J. Kantorow M. Vanderzwaag D. McKenney K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8030-8035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their conclusion was that Arg-123 provides an important but not essential contact for CRP activation. Both of these claims are consistent with the high degree of conservation of this residue in all known CRP homologs. Because Arg-123 is a C-helix residue relatively close to Thr-127 and Ser-128, which are important for CRP activation, we were intrigued by its suggested role and high sequence conservation and, therefore, examined it more closely. Our results do indicate a set of important roles for the residue, but these roles are different from those proposed by Berman et al. (8Berman H.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Goodsell D.S. Haste N.M. Korney A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Instead, Arg-123 appears to be important for determining a biologically proper affinity for cAMP and stabilizing the inactive form of CRP when cAMP is absent. Strains, Plasmids, and Recombinant DNA Methodology—For the isolation and manipulation of DNA, standard methods were used throughout this study (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides used for sequencing, PCR amplification, and mutant construction were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, Iowa). Bacterial strains carrying different plasmids were propagated in 1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl (LC medium) with 15 μg/ml tetracycline, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, or 50 μg/ml ampicillin as appropriate. Cloning of crp and Generation of Mutants—E. coli crp was cloned into pEXT20, and then six histidine codons were subsequently added between the last sense codon and stop codon of the crp gene as previously described (7Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis involved PCR amplification of crp-containing pEXT20 with primers designed to incorporate the desired nucleotide changes as described elsewhere (11Chiang L.W. Kovari I. Howe M.M. PCR Methods Applications. 1993; 2: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The method used for codon randomization was essentially identical to that used for site-directed mutagenesis, except that the primers contained completely randomized codons for the desired positions. For screening the cAMP-dependent in vivo function of CRP variants, we used an E. coli strain, UQ4249, a crp::cam derivative of UQ3741 (M182 carrying λ prophage with CC(-61.5)::lacZ fusion) (7Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The assay monitors the ability of the CRP variants to cause β-galactosidase accumulation in colonies on agar plates. The crp genes for selected variants were sequenced to determine the causative residue changes. Overexpression and Purification of CRP Proteins—Overexpression of wild-type (WT) CRP and CRP variants for purification was carried out by the following procedure in the strain background of UQ3811, an ilv::Tn10 cya crp::cam derivative of UQ3741 (7Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cultures of UQ3811 cells transformed with plasmids encoding appropriate CRP variants were grown aerobically (220 rpm) in 2× LC medium (2% Tryptone, 1% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.5, at which point the synthesis of CRP was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Each culture volume was 40 ml in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Cultures were grown for another 5 h before harvesting by centrifugation, and the cells were stored at –80 °C. The purification of CRP proteins was done using a nickel-nitrilotriacetate column (Novagen, Madison, WI) because WT CRP and CRP variants used in this study were all His-tagged. Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 m KCl, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and broken using a French press. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and then the supernatants were loaded into Novagen nickel-nitrotriloacetate column. After washing with 50 mm imidazole, 0.5 m KCl, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, the CRP proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole, 0.5 m KCl, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and then precipitated with 42.5% ammonium sulfate and stored at –80 °C until use. All protein preparations were >95% homogeneous. Measurement of in Vitro DNA Binding Activity of CRP Proteins—In vitro DNA binding assays were performed using the fluorescence polarization technique with a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization detector (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI). A fluorescent DNA probe was generated in which a 26-base pair target DNA containing CCpmelR (5′-GTAAATGTGATGTACATCACATGGAT-3′) was labeled with Texas Red on one end of the duplex (12Gaston K. Bell A. Kolb A. Buc H. Busby S. Cell. 1990; 62: 733-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA. The probe was used at a concentration of 5 nm in the presence of 6.4 μm salmon sperm DNA. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by fitting the binding data to the equation, r=r1+Δr×Kd+DT+PT-Kd+DT+PT2-4DTPT2DT(Eq. 1) where r, r1, and Δr are the observed anisotropy, the anisotropy of free DNA, and the total change in anisotropy, respectively, [D]T and [P]T are the total concentrations of DNA and CRP protein, and Kd is a dissociation constant. Measurement of Apparent cAMP Binding Affinity Coupled with DNA Binding Measurement—cAMP binding affinity of WT CRP and various Arg-123 CRP variants were calculated by measuring DNA binding activity of each protein with various amounts of cAMP up to 1 mm. Concentrations of CRP and DNA were 200 and 5 nm. Otherwise the method is identical to the one described above. In principle, there are 5 possible conformers of CRP (with 0 ∼ 4 cAMP bound) that can interact with DNA (13Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14935-14943Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the apoCRP form has been reported to have very low DNA affinity that may not contribute to specific binding equilibrium (14Takahashi M. Blazy B. Baudras A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 783-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, the population of CRP with 3 or 4 cAMP bound can be neglected because the relatively low [cAMP] does not allow binding to the poor-affinity secondary site. Therefore, the multiple equilibria we consider are, P+L⇄PL+L⇄PL2++DDPLD+L⇄PL2D(Eq. 2) where P, L, and D represent CRP, cAMP, and DNA, respectively. The system is completely described by intrinsic binding constant of cAMP to a binding site in CRP (k), cooperativity between two cAMP binding sites (w), DNA binding constant of CRP with one cAMP bound (K1), and DNA binding constant of CRP with two cAMP bound (K2) (2k = [PL]/[P][L], ½kw = [PL2]/[PL][L], K1 = [PLD/[PD][D], K2 = [PL2D]/[PL2][D]). The equations for total concentrations of all species in system are Ptot=P+2kPL+k2wPL2+2K1kPLD+K2k2wPL2D(Eq. 3) Ltot=2kPL+2k2wPL2+2K1kPLD+2K2k2wPL2D(Eq. 4) Dtot=D+2K1kPLD+K2k2wPL2D(Eq. 5) Once [P], [L], and [D] are solved for the three equations, the concentrations of all components in the system can be calculated. First, [D] can be expressed in terms of other unknowns, [P] and [L]. D=Dtot1+2K1kPL+K2k2wPL2(Eq. 6) Equation 2 can be rearranged into a quadratic equation of [P] after substituting Equation 5 for [D]. Therefore, [P] is obtained from a root of the quadratic equation in terms of [L], P=-b+b2-4ac2a(Eq. 7) where a = (2K1k[L] + K2k2w[L]2)(1 + 2k[L] + k2w[L]), b = 1 + 2k[L] + k2w[L]2 + ([D]tot – [P]tot)(2K1 k[L] + k2w[L]2), and c = –[P]tot. Finally, after substituting Equation 5 and Equation 6 for [D] and [L], Equation 3 is numerically solved for [L] (0 ≤ [L] ≤ [L]tot) using the bisection algorithm. Binding isotherms for WT CRP and the Arg-123 variants were analyzed using Equation 7 by assuming that the anisotropy signal of singly cAMP-bound CRP is the same as that of doubly cAMP-bound form, r=r1+ΔrPLD+PL2DDtot(Eq. 8) where r1 is the anisotropy of free DNA, Δr is the anisotropy change relative to free DNA upon binding of CRP with one or two cAMP bound, [PLD] = 2K1k[P][L][D], and [PL2D] = K2k2w[P][L]2[D]. Although this general scheme was used for a comprehensive model (case 2), we also considered a simpler model (case 1). In case 1, we assumed that (i) the two cAMP binding sites are identical and non-cooperative (w = 1) and that (ii) only doubly cAMP-bound CRP is active in DNA binding (consequently, there is no equilibrium of PL + D ↔ PLD, and K1 = 0). Implicit fitting was performed in the nonlinear regression program NONLIN (15Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar) combined with the numerical algorithm described above. The anisotropy of free DNA (r1) was independent of [cAMP], and the average of ∼5 independent measurements was used in fitting other parameters. The binding constant of CRP with two cAMP bound to DNA (K2) was independently measured at a saturating concentration of cAMP (1 mm). We obtained 1 × 108 m–1 of K2 consistently for WT CRP and all of the variants except for R123I variant. Arg-123 Has an in Vivo Role in cAMP-dependent CRP Activation—To systematically analyze the role of Arg-123 in cAMP-dependent CRP activation, we randomized the codon for Arg-123 in a library of crp-bearing plasmids and transformed the resulting pool of plasmids into UQ4249, a cya+crp– E. coli reporter strain that contains the lacZ gene under the control of the class I CC(-61.5) promoter (7Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Busby S.J. Thomas M.S. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although the expression of crp from the vector, pEXT20, is strictly regulated by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, we screened without isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, which yielded a low but sufficient level of CRP accumulation that allowed us to differentiate CRP variants based on the range of blue color. We chose a cya+ strain rather than using external cAMP with a cya– strain for two reasons. First, the cAMP level in a cya+ strain directly reflects a reasonable intracellular level in an E. coli cell. Second, we have shown that externally added cAMP does not efficiently elevate intracellular cAMP concentration (7Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). More than 400 colonies were examined, which ensured that all possible residues at position 123 were examined. Less than 5% of the colonies were white, similar to background levels, suggesting a low population of inactive CRP variants altered at this position. Consistent with this percentage, sequence analysis identified the inactive variants as having Pro, stop codons, or secondary mutations (Table 1). The other colonies showed a spectrum of blue colors that was above the background. To differentiate among those variants, we picked colonies from the top 10% (more active than the bulk) and the bottom 10% (less active than the bulk) in terms of blue color. As shown in Table 1, Arg, Ser, Val, or Asn substitution led to high activity, and Trp, Ile, or Thr substitution resulted in relatively low activity. The variety of residues identified in colonies with activity along with the high frequency of blue colonies suggests that Arg-123 is not essential for a significant response to the intracellular level of cAMP.TABLE 1Codon randomization for CRP Arg-123 and screening of the plasmid pool in a cya+ crp– E. coli strain, UQ4249R123XAmino acid (DNA codon) (sequence at 123 position)Wild typeArg (CGT)W-1aIn the UQ4249 background (no isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside).Pro (CCC)W-2Pro (CCG)W-3Stop (TAG)W-4Thr (ACC) + R185H (CAC)W-5Phe (TTT) + P154L (CTA)B-1Arg (AGA)B-2Ser (AGT)B-3Arg (CGG)B-4Arg (CGC)B-5Val (GTT)B-6Arg (AGA)B-7Asn (AAT)LB-1Trp (TGG)LB-2Ile (ATC)LB-3Ile (ATA)LB-4Thr (ACT)a In the UQ4249 background (no isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside). Open table in a new tab Arg-123 Is Not Important for the cAMP-induced Conformational Change of CRP—The results obtained in vivo are highly suggestive, but there are a variety of complicating factors, such as interaction with RNA polymerase, that make it impossible to directly interpret those results simply in terms of the formation of the active form of CRP by cAMP binding. We, therefore, chose (or created) five Arg-123 variants for further analysis: R123K, R123N, R123S, R123E, and R123I CRP. These variants were His-tagged at the C terminus, since we have already shown that His-tagged WT CRP has an affinity for target DNA in the presence of cAMP that is comparable with untagged WT CRP (7Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified and tested for DNA affinity using fluorescent anisotropy, as we have done previously (7Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As shown in the top portion of Table 2, R123K, R123S, R123N, and R123E CRP had affinities for target DNA in the presence of 1 mm (also of 0.1 mm) cAMP that were indistinguishable from that of WT CRP, although R123I CRP had slightly lower (∼2-fold) DNA affinity. This result indicates that the cAMP-bound form of each CRP variant is functionally similar to that of WT CRP. Furthermore, the fact that a variety of dissimilar residues are fully capable of supporting normal activation of CRP by cAMP binding disproves an essential role of Arg at this position for the proper conformational change of CRP in response to cAMP as has been proposed (8Berman H.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Goodsell D.S. Haste N.M. Korney A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).TABLE 2In vitro DNA binding activities of various Arg-123 variants in the wild-type CRP background, in the T127L/S128V CRP background, or in the T127L/S128I CRP backgroundCRPSequenceIn vitro DNA binding activity (Kd)123127128No cAMP0.1 mm cAMP1 mm cAMP1 mm cGMPnmWild typeArgThrSer—a—, Samples where the Kd > 5000 nm.1013—R123KLysThrSer—109—R123NAsnThrSer—91054R123SSerThrSer—1312+/-bWeak response at high protein concentration (>1 μm).R123EGluThrSer—1210+/-R123IIleThrSer—4525—(R)LVArgLeuVal7921819NDcND, not determined.KLVLysLeuVal19912NDNLVAsnLeuVal461415NDSLVSerLeuVal691617NDELVGluLeuVal10211852NDILVIleLeuVal1206350NDDLVAspLeuVal557457ND(R)LIArgLeuIle351416NDKLILysLeuIle141615NDNLIAsnLeuIle121313NDSLISerLeuIle141516NDa —, Samples where the Kd > 5000 nm.b Weak response at high protein concentration (>1 μm).c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Arg-123 Is Important for Apparent cAMP Affinity—If Arg-123 is not important for a response to saturating levels of cAMP, it might still be important for appropriate cAMP affinity. To test this, we performed a coupled assay with each CRP protein that measures the DNA affinity at various concentrations of cAMP. As shown in Fig. 1, WT CRP showed the highest affinity isotherm, and R123I CRP showed with lowest among the variants tested. Because all Arg-123 variants displayed comparable DNA affinities at a saturating levels of cAMP (Table 2), the likely basis for the differences in binding isotherms would appear to be differential cAMP affinity. To estimate the different cAMP affinities of WT and the Arg-123 variants, binding isotherms were further analyzed by a simple model (case 1) described under “Experimental Procedures.” In this model, the two cAMP binding sites are assumed to be identical and non-cooperative (w = 1), and only doubly cAMP-bound CRP is assumed to be active in DNA binding. This simple model provided reasonable fits for all isotherms (see Fig. 1) with the cAMP affinity of WT CRP being the highest and that of R123I CRP being the lowest (see k of case 1 in Table 3). Compared with WT CRP, R123N CRP is 2-fold poorer, and the other variants are 4–44-fold poorer.TABLE 3cAMP binding parameters of wild-type CRP and Arg-123 variants deconvoluted from the coupled assay of DNA bindingCRPCase 1Case 2k (=kw)Relative affinitykwRelative affinitym–1-foldm-1-foldWild type1.2 × 1061.008.0 × 1041.00R123N6.3 × 1050.534.0 × 1040.50R123S2.7 × 1050.231.4 × 1040.18R123K1.5 × 1050.137.4 × 1030.09R123E1.3 × 1050.117.8 × 1030.10R123I2.7 × 1040.021.9 × 1030.02 Open table in a new tab Although this result suggests that the difference in binding isotherms reflects the effects of Arg-123 mutation on apparent cAMP affinity, we were concerned that the calculated cAMP affinity of WT CRP by case 1 (1.2 × 106 m–1) was significantly higher than values reported previously (1.4 × 105 to 2.8 × 104 m–1) (17Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Shi Y. Wang S. Schwarz F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Malecki J. Polit A. Wasylewski Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8480-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A more sophisticated model was devised to reconcile this discrepancy. In the new model (case 2) we introduced two additional parameters (K1 and w); K1 is the DNA affinity of singly cAMP-bound CRP, and w is the cooperativity between the two cAMP binding sites. We reasoned that the interaction of singly cAMP bound CRP with DNA and cooperativity between cAMP binding sites, which have not been explicitly taken account into in simple model, may explain the apparent discrepancy. Unfortunately, fitting these four parameters (Δr, K1, k, and w) does not yield a unique set of the solutions because of the intrinsic correlations among K1, k, and w. We, therefore, relied on the reported values for WT CRP, with k = 4 × 104 m–1 and w = 2 (17Lin S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When the WT isotherm in Fig. 1 was fitted with these values, we obtained a value of K1 of 2.7 × 108 of (m–1) with the fitting quality being statistically and visually indistinguishable from that of case 1 (data not shown). For analysis of the Arg-123 variants by Case 2, the K1 and K2 values of WT CRP were used to fit the binding isotherms of Fig. 1 and thereby to extract k and w of each variant. The use of WT K1 and K2 values for variant analyses is not unreasonable given the comparable DNA affinities of the variants and WT CRP at both 0.1 and 1.0 mm cAMP (at 0.1 mm, there should be a significant population of the singly bound species with WT CRP, whereas at 1.0 mm the population should be almost entirely doubly bound). The extraction of k and w allows us to determine the apparent cAMP affinity (kw). By this analysis, the affinity value of WT CRP as well as the Arg-123 variants has been lowered by ∼17-fold, bringing it roughly in line with published results (Table 3) (for more details, see supplemental Table 1). However, the rank order of the various proteins is very similar in both cases 1 and 2, suggesting that the apparent cAMP affinity ranking is model-independent. For the purpose of our central claim, the clear result is that Arg-123 substitution has a significant effect on the affinity of CRP for cAMP. Arg-123 Plays a Role in Stabilizing the Inactive Conformation of cAMP-free CRP—Dynamic transitions observed in allosteric processes can be described by an equilibrium shift of pre-existing populations, which dynamically interchange even in the absence of the allosteric ligand (20Kern D. Zuiderweg E.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 748-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). We believe that CRP exists in an equilibrium as well and that cAMP binding to the protein changes the population dynamics and thereby shifts the equilibrium toward the active form. We then considered the possibility that Arg-123 might have a role in stabilizing the inactive form of cAMP-free CRP, which would in turn affect the pre-existing equilibrium between the two forms and eventually the effectiveness of ligand binding. As indicated in Table 2, no Arg-123 substitution resulted in detectable DNA affinity in the absence of cAMP. However, this does not necessarily mean that Arg-123 is unimportant in stabilizing the inactive CRP form by the following argument. We reasoned that cAMP-free WT CRP had extremely low DNA binding activity, and therefore, even a significant shift of the equilibrium might not be experimentally measurable. We, therefore, started with a CRP variant that is already partially shifted toward the active form in the absence of cAMP and asked how the additional substitutions at position 123 in that background changed that equilibrium. We chose T127L/S128V CRP because we have already shown that it has modest activity in the absence of cAMP (Ref. 7Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Fig. 2). The resultant triple variants (R123X/T127L/S128V variants) were monitored for their DNA affinity in the absence of cAMP. The striking result is that all the Arg-123 substitutions tested resulted in substantially higher DNA affinity in the absence of cAMP (7–42-fold) than did the starting variant with Arg-123 (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Such a change in affinity could result from either stabilization of the active form or destabilization of the inactive form or both. The fact that a variety of dissimilar residues had a fundamentally similar effect shows that it is the absence of Arg-123 that is causative of this improved affinity and not the presence of any specific replacement residue. Similarly, the fact that it is the absence of Arg-123 that is causative is inconsistent with the proposal that a new specific contact stabilizes the active form and much more easily rationalized by a destabilization of the inactive form. Furthermore, the R123K CRP, which is expected to be most similar to the WT residue, is the one variant that showed the most dissimilar property in this particular experiment, implying that this role is highly specific to Arg. We speculate that Lys-123 not only lacks the necessary property for the stabilization of the inactive form but also has additional effect of unclear nature. We wondered if the substitutions at position 123 would also have an effect on the cAMP-independent activity on a different CRP variant that was even mor"
https://openalex.org/W2030151189,"The ninaE-encoded Rh1 rhodopsin is the major light-sensitive pigment expressed in Drosophila R1-6 photoreceptor cells. Rh1 rhodopsin localizes to and is essential for the development and maintenance of the rhabdomere, the specialized membrane-rich organelle that serves as the site of phototransduction. We showed previously that the vertebrate bovine rhodopsin (Rho) is expressed and properly localized in Drosophila photoreceptor cells. Drosophila photoreceptors expressing only Rho have normal rhabdomere structure at young ages, but the rhabdomeres are not maintained and show extensive disorganization by 7-10 days of age. A series of Rho-Rh1 opsin chimeric rhodopsins were used to identify Rh1 domains required for maintenance of rhabdomeric structure. The results show that the Rh1 rhodopsin cytoplasmic tail domain, positioned to interact with cytoplasmic structural components, plays a major role in promoting rhabdomeric organization."
https://openalex.org/W2048471105,"MT1-MMP is a potent collagenase not only required for skeletal development but also implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. The mechanism through which cellsdeploy MT1-MMP to mediate collagenolysis remains largely unknown. C-terminally truncated MT1-MMP lacking its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, although proteolytic active in purified forms, is known to be deficient in cell-mediated proMMP2 activation and collagenolysis, suggesting that cells regulate its activity through both domains. Indeed, the cytoplasmic domain is recognized by the trafficking machinery that mediates its internalization and recycling. Here we demonstrate that its transmembrane domain can be functionally substituted by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor of MT6-MMP. The GPI-anchored MT1-MMP, or MT1-GPI, activates proMMP2 on the cell surface and promotes cell growth in a three-dimensional type I collagen matrix. On the other hand, a GPI-anchored MMP13 with a functional furin activation signal fails to promote cell growth in a three-dimensional collagen matrix, whereas remaining competent in collagenolysis on a two-dimensional collagen matrix under serum-free conditions. α2 macroglobulin (α2M) or serum is sufficient to inhibit the collagenase activity of GPI-anchored active MMP13. Our results suggest that both membrane-tethering and proteolytic activity encoded by MT1-MMP are required for its ability to promote cell growth and invasion in a three-dimensional collagen matrix.

However, each individual MMP is expected to cleave its respective substrates in a time- and tissue-dependent fashion during development to sculpt a specific tissue or organ (1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Since these MMPs provide the necessary remodeling activities to ensure proper growth and differentiation of many cell types, they must be modulated in precision by cells producing them. Currently, there are 21 members within this superfamily, which can be subdivided into two major categories: seven membrane-bound and 14 soluble MMPs. Although the soluble MMPs may be secreted to the extracellular milieu, where they may attack the ECM components freely, the seven membrane-bound MMPs, including one MMP anchored by a type II transmembrane domain, four anchored by type I transmembrane domains, and two anchored by GPI anchors, may be regulated at the cell surface to focus their proteolytic attack more precisely (3Seiki M.

It has been hypothesized that these membrane-bound MMPs are regulated by their host cells through trafficking events to deliver their proteolytic activities in precision (6Wang X. Ma D. Keski-Oja J.

The archetypal MT1-MMP is the most studied and has been shown to play a critical role in the development of skeleton, cartilage, and other bone tissues (7Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S.

It has emerged as a model system to study cell surface-mediated proteolysis in both normal and malignant cells. We and others have shown that MT1-MMP undergoes dynamic trafficking between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane (9Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl.

Furthermore, the signals responsible for membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) trafficking appear to be coded in the cytoplasmic tails (5Wang P. Wang X. Pei D. J. Biol.

For example, the LLY motif has been demonstrated as the internalization signal for MT1-MMP, whereas the C-terminal motif DKV mediates recycling of internalized MT1-MMP to the cell surface (5Wang P.

These regulatory processes should ensure the appropriate amount of MT1-MMP activity to be displayed on the cell surface to mediate precise degradation of ECM beneath the plasma membrane. Indeed, truncation of its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains from MT1-MMP generated a mutant deficient in mediating proMMP2 activation and promoting cell growth in a three-dimensional collagen matrix at the cellular level, whereas fully functional in purified forms (13Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). However, removal of the cytoplasmic domain alone yields a gain-of-function mutant with enhanced activities against proMMP2 and three-dimensional collagen matrix due to impaired internalization (9Jiang A.

These data suggest that tethering to the cell surface would be sufficient to allow MT1-MMP to express its proteolytic activity against its substrates at the cellular level. To test this idea, we engineered a GPI anchor at the carboxyl end of MT1-MMP ectodomain and demonstrated that the GPI anchor can rescue the activity of transmembrane-truncated MT1-MMP on the cell surface. However, tethering a fully active collagenase MMP13 to the cell surface by a GPI anchor failed to yield a MT1-MMP-like activity toward three-dimensional type I collagen matrix, suggesting that MT1-MMP encodes collagenolytic activity different from that of MMP13. Cell Culture—MDCK cells, MCF-7 cells, and HEK293 cells are from ATCC and maintained in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum as described (5Wang P. Wang X. Pei D. J. Biol.

MMP13-F was generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, CA) to insert in-frame a 12-amino-acid sequence from MMP11 (Asp87–Phe98) into the coding sequence of MMP13 (between Glu103 and Tyr104). Chimeras were generated using overlapping primers designed for recombining the GPI anchor signal in MT6-MMP with the C terminus of the hemopexin-like domain of MT1-MMP or MMP13 through a PCR strategy. Thus, the MT1-GPI chimera contains Met1–Cys508 of MT1-MMP and Pro510–Arg562 of MT6-MMP; MMP13-F-GPI contains Pro510–Arg562 of MT6-MMP in the C terminus.

Two-dimensional and Three-dimensional Collagen Cell Culture—Collagen gel was prepared by neutralizing rat tail type I collagen (BD Biosciences) in acetic acid solution with 10× PBS and 1 n NaOH at the final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml as described (14Kang T.

For cell growth assay in three-dimensional collagen gels, 1 × 104 cells were mixed with collagen solution at 4 °C prior to gelling at 37 °C. Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS.

For cell surface staining, cells grown on coverslips were washed with ice-cold PBS (3×) and allowed to chill at 4 °C.

PI-PLC Treatment— cells were treated with or without PI-PLC (10 units/ml) in serum-free DMEM in the presence of 5 μm GM6001 at 37 °C for 1 h as described (17Itoh Y. Kajita M. Kinoh H. Mori H. Okada A. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34260-34266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). GPI Anchor Restores the Cell-mediated proMMP2 Activation Activity of Transmembrane Domain Truncated MT1-MMP—As the first member of the MT-MMP family, MT1-MMP was shown to be the long sought membrane-associated activator for proMMP2 (18Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). However, truncation of its transmembrane domain led to the release of a fully active ectoenzyme into culture medium that can activate proMMP2 and degrade ECM components upon purification (19Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, this transmembrane-deletion mutant lost its ability to activate proMMP2 at the cellular level (20Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain of interleukin-2 receptor α chain was able to restore the cell-based proMMP2 activation when fused to MT1-MMP ectoenzyme (20Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the cell surface provides an ideal environment for MT1-MMP to recognize, bind, and cleave its substrates. If this is correct, any means that tethers the ectoenzyme of MT1-MMP should be able to restore its cell-associated activity. To this end, we selected the GPI anchor of MT6-MMP (21Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) to tether the MT1-MMP ectoenzyme to the cell surface as shown in Fig. 1A. To assess the function of MT1-GPI, we evaluated its ability to activate proMMP2 on the cell surface. As shown in Fig. 1B, MT1-GPI efficiently activates proMMP2 supplied in the medium (lane 10), whereas soluble MT1-MMP does not (lane 7). Surprisingly, MT1-GPI is more efficient than wild-type MT1-MMP (Fig. 1B, lane 10 versus lane 8) but less efficient than MT1-ΔC (Fig. 1B, lane 10 versus lane 9), perhaps reflecting the amount of active enzymes on the cell surface as demonstrated previously (9Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Immunostainings shown in Fig. 2, A and B, demonstrate that indeed, MT1-GPI is presented mostly on the cell surface. The staining data were confirmed using cell surface labeling by biotinylation as shown in Fig. 2C. Also, PI-PLC treatment of the MT1-GPI-expressing cells indeed released cell surface MT1-GPI proteins as indicated by diminished immunostaining signal (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that GPI is capable of anchoring MT1-MMP ectodomain on the cell surface and providing an ideal environment for MT1-MMP to cleave its substrates.FIGURE 2MT1-GPI is presented to cell surface. A, MDCK control cells (Mock), MT1-MMP wild type (WT), and MT1 mutants (MT1-ΔC(ΔC) and MT1-GPI (GPI)) MDCK stable lines were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with rabbit anti-MT1-MMP antibody and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. B, surface staining of MT1-MMP MDCK stable lines. MDCK control cells (Mock), MT1-MMP wild type, and MT1 mutant (MT1-ΔC and MT1-GPI) MDCK stable lines were incubated with rabbit anti-MT1 antibody for 2 h on ice before being fixed and stained with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. C, the accumulation of MT1-MMP on the cell surface determined by surface biotinylation. After MT1-MMP, stable lines were incubated with 5 μm GM6001 for 16 h, and cells were biotinylated on ice, lysed, and immunoprecipitated (IP) with streptavidin (Strep) and then blotted (IB) with rabbit anti-MT1-MMP antibody. pro, pro form; act, active form.

After being washed with PBS, cells were stained with rabbit anti-MT1-MMP antibody and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GPI Anchor Can Substitute the Transmembrane Domain of MT1-MMP in Cell Growth in Three-dimensional Collagen Matrix—To further demonstrate that GPI-anchored MT1 functions equivalently as the wild-type MT1-MMP as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, we analyzed their ability to promote cell growth and invasion in a three-dimensional collagen matrix. To this end, we generated stable cell lines that express MT1-GPI in MDCK as described previously (22Wang P. Nie J. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51148-51155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the stable clones MT1-GPI-8 and -9 were generated and found to express the protein well but less than MT1-WT and MT1-ΔC(lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 2–4). To assess their ability to grow and invade into three-dimensional collagen, we embedded the cells in three-dimensional collagen and measured their growth as described (22Wang P. Nie J. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51148-51155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, MT1-GPI-expressing cells are also able to promote cell growth and invasion very well in a three-dimensional collagen matrix, more effectively than cells expressing MT1-WT (B and C). The enhancements are inhibited by GM6001, a MMP inhibitor. Therefore, MT1-GPI, tethered on the cell surface by a GPI anchor (Figs. 2 and 3), can promote cell invasion and metastasis. This set of data demonstrates strongly that MT1-MMP is a potent proteinase for cell invasion and metastasis if it can be displayed on the cell surface, suggesting that a malignant switch may be the translocation of MT1-MMP from intracellular pools to the cell surface as we demonstrated previously with concanavalin A treatment (9Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Membrane-associated MMP13 Is Not Able to Promote Cell Growth in Three-dimensional Collagen Matrix but Maintains Its Collagenase Activity in the Absence of Serum—Our data presented so far suggest that MT1-MMP can promote cell invasion and growth in type I collagen three-dimensional matrix as long as it can be displayed on the cell surface (Fig. 3), suggesting that collagenolytic activity presented on the cell surface should be able to generate the same effects. To test this idea, we engineered a construct that should be able to deliver collagenolytic activity on the cell surface as shown in Fig. 4A. Previously, Weiss and colleagues (13Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) have indicated that MMP13 is another strong collagenase but is not able to usurp cell growth in three-dimensional collagen, even when they generated active MMP13 by inserting that furin activation motif RXKR in front of its catalytic domain. In light of our data, we interpret that this molecule should be inactive because it is not on the cell surface since soluble MT1-MMP is also a good collagenase but fails to promote cell growth in a three-dimensional collagen matrix. Thus, it is of interest to test whether the cause for the negative phenotype of MMP13 is due to the fact that it is not membrane-associated. To accomplish this goal, we generated membrane-associated active MMP13, MMP13F-GPI, as shown in Fig. 4A. MMP13F-GPI is activated by a furin-mediated process and displayed on the cell surface as expected (Fig. 4, B and C). The GPI anchor of MMP13F-GPI is verified by PI-PLC treatment, which shed soluble MMP13 into conditioned medium (Fig. 4D). However, it failed to promote cell growth in a three-dimensional collagen matrix (Fig. 4E, MMP13F-GPI), suggesting that MT1-MMP differs from MMP13 in a fundamental way that mere presentation on the cell surface is not sufficient to generate an invasive and growth phenotype in three-dimensional collagen under identical condition. α2M Blocks Membrane-associated MMP13 Collagenase Activity but Not MT1-MMP-mediated Cell Invasion into Collagen Gel—To unravel the functional difference between MMP13 and MT1-MMP, we reasoned that they might have different sensitivity toward serum. We have observed previously that the ectodomain of MT1-MMP can degrade blocks of collagen under serum-free conditions but is totally inactive in the presence of 10% FBS (data not shown). We wondered whether MMP13 could be subjected to the regulation in serum. We removed the serum when culturing MMP13-expressing cells on collagen and found that MMP13F-GPI shows robust collagenase activity much like soluble active MMP13-F, as shown in Fig. 5A (left column). MMP inhibitor GM6001 is effective in blocking the observed collagenolysis (Fig. 5A, middle column). Interestingly, 10% FBS also blocked the degradation, suggesting that serum components inhibited the MMP13 activity or inactivated MMP13 (Fig. 5A, right column). α2M is the major nonspecific proteinase inhibitor in serum. α2M can inhibit all soluble MMPs in test tubes. Thus, we hypothesize that α2M is the serum component that blocked the collagenase activity of MMP13. Indeed, α2M blocked the collagen degradation by MMP13F-GPI when added to serum-free medium (Fig. 5B, panel c versus panel b), whereas it had little effect on MT1ΔC (Fig. 5B, panel g versus panel f). As expected, GM6001 blocked both MMP13F-GPI and MT1ΔC completely (Fig. 5B, panels d and h). Taken together, these data suggest that MT1-MMP on the cell surface can escape α2M inhibition, whereas membrane-anchored MMP13 cannot. MT1-MMP is critical for cell migration, cell invasion, tumor progression, and skeletal development. A better understanding of MT1-MMP regulation may help target this important enzyme for anticancer drug development. Here we present the evidence that MT1-MMP relies on membrane anchorage and a unique catalytic mechanism to execute efficient collagenolysis and promote cell invasion and growth in a three-dimensional collagen matrix. MT-MMPs play important roles in multiple physiological and pathological processes. MT-MMPs have some unique functions when compared with other soluble MMPs. For example, MT-MMPs are able to activate soluble MMPs such as MMP-2, -9, and -13 (23Toth M. Chvyrkova I. Bernardo M.M. Hernandez-Barrantes S. Fridman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Knauper V. Will H. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Atkinson S.J. Stanton H. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Membrane association helps cells present these proteinases on membrane and allows cells to target these proteases to the invading front of cells through protein sorting (26Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Moreover, membrane association plays a critical role in maintaining the proteinase activity for MT1-MMP. Although GPI-anchored MT-MMPs (MT4, 6-MMP) have very low activity in collagen degradation and proMMP-2 activation (27Nie J. Pei D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6758-6762PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wang Y. Johnson A.R. Ye Q.Z. Dyer R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33043-33049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), our results suggest that the GPI anchors are the functionally equivalent to type I transmembrane domains, and thus, may not be responsible for the low activity observed. As shown in this report, the GPI anchor promotes the localization of MT1-MMP on the cell surface and enhances MT1-MMP activity as efficiently as a transmembrane domain. GPI-anchored protein is known to be targeted to lipid rafts. Indeed, the internalization of MT1-MMP is partially through the caveolin-dependent pathway (29Galvez B.G. Matias-Roman S. Yanez-Mo M. Vicente-Manzanares M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 678-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 30Remacle A. Murphy G. Roghi C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3905-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and the interaction between MT1-MMP and caveolin-1 is required for MT1-MMP dependent cell locomotion (31Labrecque L. Nyalendo C. Langlois S. Durocher Y. Roghi C. Murphy G. Gingras D. Beliveau R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52132-52140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with our observation that a GPI anchor could functionally substitute the transmembrane domain of MT1-MMP. We further speculate that MT1-GPI mutant may serve as a good model in the investigation of the function and activity of MT1-MMP in lipid rafts. As a unique collagenase in the MMP family, MT1-MMP could promote cell cyst growth and tumor progression in a three-dimensional collagen culture, whereas other collagenases did not (13Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). This observation poses two questions. Is membrane association the only requirement for collagenase activity in a three-dimensional collagen culture in the presence of serum? Also, does membrane anchorage cause the conformational change in collagenases to be able to escape the inhibition by α2M? Here we demonstrated that MMP13 could degrade collagen in a two-dimensional collagen culture in the absence of serum but not in a three-dimensional matrix. α2M or serum is sufficient to inhibit membrane-anchored MMP13 activity in collagen degradation but not against MT1-MMP. These results are consistent with the notion that both membrane anchorage and the unique activity of MT1-MMP contribute to the robust collagenolytic activity observed in a three-dimensional matrix. Proteinases are destructive enzymes that may cause irreparable damage to tissues or organs in the body. Therefore, their activities must be tightly controlled in vivo, most likely by endogenous inhibitors such as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase. Serum contains multiple types of proteinase inhibitors that can quench any free proteolytic activity instantaneously so that homeostasis can be maintained in the body. So far, only MT1-MMP and its relatives, MT3 and MT5-MMPs, can circumvent the inhibitory effects of 10% serum in cell culture, whereas none of their secreted counterparts can. MT1-MMP significantly promotes cell cyst growth in a three-dimensional collagen culture, whereas soluble MT1-MMP does not display growth-enhancing activity (13Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). One of the reasons could be that MT1-MMP can escape the inhibition of serum but soluble MT1-MMP cannot. Here we demonstrated that α2M is one of the inhibitory components in serum that is sufficient to inhibit membrane-anchored MMP13 activity in collagen degradation. α2M inhibits proteinases by entrapping them and preventing them from their protein substrates. However, certain proteinases can find a way to evade these inhibitors. For example, serine proteinases can escape endogenous inhibitors in serum such as antitrypsin, antichemotrypsin, and α2M (32Travis J. Am. J. Med. 1988; 84: 37-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be determined how proteinases maintain their activity in the presence of those inhibitors present in serum. The mechanism for MT1-MMP to escape the inhibition effect of α2M needs further investigation and may serve as a model system to study the interactions between proteinases and their inhibitors. Understating this mechanism may provide a novel way to design specific inhibitors against MT1-MMP. Given the important function of MT1-MMP in tumor cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis, specific inhibitors against MT1-MMP may inhibit tumor growth and invasion, and thus, may be developed into treatments for various human cancers."

The role of H3 phosphorylation in the osmotic stress response was investigated on the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter in different chromatin configurations. Hormone-dependent transcription from the MMTV promoter is repressed by osmotic stress when the promoter is integrated and has a normal chromatin structure. However, when the MMTV promoter is transiently transfected, the chromatin structure is less organized, and hormone induction is not affected by osmotic stress. On the integrated MMTV promoter, phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 and 28 increases in response to osmotic stress, but the transient promoter shows no change. Hormone-dependent glucocorticoid receptor binding is reduced on the repressed promoter, and elevated H3 phosphorylation is temporally correlated with maximal MMTV repression Additionally, the protein kinase C inhibitor rottlerin, but not other kinase inhibitors, blocks both histone H3 phosphorylation and osmotic repression of MMTV transcription. Glucocorticoid receptor binding is inversely correlated with H3 phosphorylation, suggesting that displacement of the glucocorticoid receptor from the promoter is due to H3 phosphorylation and is the mechanism for the osmotic repression of hormone-dependent transcription.

Cells respond to changes in the environment by altering many cellular pathways and functions. Modification of proteins, activation, or repression of genes, growth arrest, or apoptosis may all be affected by environmental stimuli. The responses are specific to the environmental stimulus and cell type and involve independent but overlapping pathways. Modification of chromatin proteins, particularly phosphorylation of histone H3 at serines 10 and 28, is a response to many environmental growth and stress stimuli (1.Bode A.M. Dong Z. Sci.

An increase in histone H3 phosphorylation was first observed in conjunction with chromatin condensation in mitosis, and Aurora B kinase was found to mediate the mitotic H3 phosphorylation (4.Goto H.

In addition to the various signal transduction kinases, the regulation of H3 phosphorylation is influenced by nucleosomal structure and nucleosome-dependent binding of other chromosomal proteins. In particular, HMGN1 binds specifically to nucleosomes and interacts with histones H1 and H3 (17.Trieschmann L. Martin B. Bustin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5468-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18.Ding H.F. Bustin M. Hansen U. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5843-5855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HMGN1 is phosphorylated in response to stress stimuli modifying both HMGN1 binding to the nucleosome and chromatin packing, which affects the ability of kinases to phosphorylate histone H3 (19.Lim J.H.

Osmotic stress causes the activation of some genes and repression of others. In kidney, hypertonic stress induced genes that promote the accumulation of organic osmolytes (sorbitol, betaine) to reduce loss of water from cells. Osmotic stress causes an increase in chaperones (Hsp70) that protect protein macromolecules against misfolding and aggregation. Hypertonic stress also reduces the level of glucose-regulated proteins (21.Uchida S. Yamauchi A. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. J. Clin.

Proteomics analysis identified a similar number of proteins down-regulated versus up-regulated in osmotic stress (24.Dihazi H. Rahman A.A. Agarwal N.K. Doncheva Y. Muller G.A. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1445-1458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cellular response to osmotic stress involves several signal transduction pathways (25.Sheikh-Hamad D. Gustin M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1102-F1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Important components include the MAP kinases p38, JNK, and ERK, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fyn and Syk, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and both conventional and novel PKCs. These kinases are activated by either hypertonic or hypotonic osmotic stress, although not all kinases are involved in different cell types. Maximal expression may require the convergence of different pathways. Human p38 is a central mediator in response to hypertonicity in most cell types and is essential for activation of some genes (25.Sheikh-Hamad D. Gustin M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1102-F1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26.Bell L.M. Leong M.L. Kim B. Wang E. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Firestone G.L. J. Biol.

JNK is phosphorylated in response to osmotic stress independently of the p38 and ERK pathway and may favor apoptosis (27.Kultz D. Garcia-Perez A. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. J. Biol.

In mouse cells, ERK is phosphorylated in response to hypertonic stress independent of p38 and JNK and may promote survival (28.Zhuang S. Hirai S.I. Ohno S. Am. J.

This study investigated whether modification of histone H3 phosphorylation is a component of the osmotic stress response and/or required for the response of the MMTV promoter to osmotic stress. The effect of chromatin structure on H3 phosphorylation and osmotic response was investigated by comparing the transiently transfected MMTV promoter with a poorly organized chromatin architecture with the normal nucleosome structure of the integrated promoter (31.Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3039-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32.Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K.

Histone H3 phosphorylation is chromatin-dependent and inversely correlated with glucocorticoid receptor binding. Finally, both histone H3 phosphorylation and repression are regulated on chromatin by PKC. Cells and Cell Culture−UL3 cells are derived from the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS by the stable addition of a rat glucocorticoid expression vector and a full-length MMTV promoter regulating a luciferase reporter (34.Rogatsky I.

UL3 cells were maintained in DMEM (H21, Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfection−Cells were transiently transfected with FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science) with an efficiency >80% as determined by β-galactosidase staining of cells transfected with 1 μg of pSport reporter (Clontech) (36.MacGregor G.R. Mogg A.E. Burke J.F. Caskey C.T. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Transient transfections routinely used a total of 0.5 μg of phhCAT in 5 × 105 UL3 cells. The phhCAT plasmid contains 325 bp of proximal MMTV promoter driving a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter (S. Nordeen, University of Colorado Medical Center, Denver, CO). Treatment−Cells were subjected to hypertonic osmotic stress by incubation in 0.2–0.3 m sorbitol in serum-free DMEM for 1–24 h. Cells were treated for hormone induction with 100 nm dexamethasone for 1 h. Hormone was added to sorbitol-containing medium in the last hour of treatment. Cells were pretreated with kinase inhibitors for 30 min before initiation of osmotic stress or hormone treatment. Inhibitors were 10 μm SB203580 for p38, 10 μm UO126 for ERK, 2 μm SP600125 for JNK, and 2 μm rottlerin for PKC (Calbiochem). Transcription Assay−Following treatment, cells were incubated in DMEM with serum overnight before assaying for luciferase or CAT activity. CAT and/or luciferase activity was measured from the same lysates using CAT and luciferase assay kits (Promega, Madison, WI). Western Blots−Cells were lysed immediately after stress or hormone treatment in radioimmune precipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 30 μl/ml aprotinin (Sigma)). Total proteins (10–25 μg) were separated on 4–20% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) or 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were visualized with antibodies to p38 and ERK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, and phospho-ERK 1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); histone H3, phospho-histone H3 Ser-10, Ser-28, and GR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody and chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). RNA Induction−Total RNA was purified from cells immediately after treatment using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Sciences, Valencia, CA). First strand cDNA was primed with oligo(dT) and transcribed using a Superscript first strand kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed with a Stratagene Mx3000P and SYBR Green detection of products to measure RNA induction (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers specific for GILZ (sense 5′-GCGTGAGAACACCCTGTTGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGCTCAGACAGGACTGGAACTT-3′), IκB (sense, 5′-CCAGGAGTGGGCCATGGAGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTCTCCCTTCACCTGGCGGATC-3′), EZF (sense, 5′-CGCTCCATTACCAAGAGCTCAT-3′, and antisense, 5′-CGATCGTCTTCCCCTCTTTG-3′) and GAPDH (sense, 5′-TCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGCAACAATATCCACTTTACCAGAGT-3′) coding regions were used. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay−Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed with a ChIP kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Immediately following treatment, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Complexes were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of antibodies to pH3 Ser-10, pH3 Ser-28, GR, or rabbit IgG as a nonspecific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Complexes were collected using protein A-agarose/DNA beads and washed five times with low salt, high salt, LiCl, and Tris-HCl-EDTA buffers. After reversing cross-links at 65 °C for 4 h, the genomic DNA was purified from eluted complexes with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). MMTV DNA was detected by PCR amplification with primers flanking the hormone-response element (glucocorticoid-response element (GRE)) (sense, 5′-TTAAGTAAGTTTTTGGTTACAAACT-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCTGGAAAGTGAAGGATAATGACGA-3′) and including ∼300 bp of the proximal promoter in the nucleosome B region of the MMTV promoter. The MMTV sense primer and an antisense primer specific to the phhCAT plasmid (5′-TTAGCTTCCTTAGCTCCTGAAAAT-3′) were used to detect the transient template. Primers for the GAPDH promoter (sense, 5′-AAAAGCGGGGAGAAAGTAGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTAGCCTCCCGGGTTTCTCT-3′) as the non-linked control and the 3′ luciferase gene (sense, 5′-CGTTGTTGTTTTGGAGCAC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTACATTTGGACTTTCCGC-3′) as the linked control were used to verify site-specific binding. Total PCR products were quantified from ethidium bromide-stained 4–12% Tris-borate EDTA PAGE gels (Invitrogen) using Alpha Innotech imaging software and verified with real-time PCR (Stratagene). The osmotic stress response in human UL3 cells was verified by Western blots of p38, JNK, and ERK kinases that are phosphorylated in response to hypertonic stress in other cells. Cells were hypertonically stressed by exposure to either 0.2 m or 0.3 m sorbitol in serum-free DMEM. The response to dexamethasone (10–7 m) in untreated or sorbitol-treated cells was also determined (Fig. 1). Hypertonic stress induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, whereas total protein levels remain unchanged (Fig. 1A). JNK was also phosphorylated in response osmotic stress. In contrast, ERK1 was not phosphorylated, although hypertonic stress phosphorylates ERK in mouse cells (28.Zhuang S. Hirai S.I. Ohno S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C102-C109Crossref Google Scholar, 30.Zhao H. Tian W. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F710-F717Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Hormone treatment had no effect on phosphorylation in either untreated or osmotic stressed cells. UL3 cells respond to osmotic stress by activating at least two signal transduction pathways that are responsive to osmotic stress in other cell types. Induction of transcriptional in response to hormone and osmotic stress in UL3 is shown for the endogenous IκB and EZF genes (Fig. 1B). Alteration in the phosphorylation of total histone H3 after treatment with osmotic stress or hormones was examined in UL3 cells. The response was analyzed immediately after treatment with dexamethasone for 1 h, sorbitol for 3 h, or sorbitol for 3 h with dexamethasone added in the last hour. No change in global phosphorylation of either H3 Ser-10 or H3 Ser-28 was observed at these treatment times (Fig. 2). No change was found in total glucocorticoid receptor levels in response to osmotic stress either in the presence or in the absence of hormone. The effect of hypertonic stress on hormone-dependent transcription was studied using the MMTV promoter organized in two distinct chromatin structures. UL3 cells contain a stably integrated MMTV promoter regulating a luciferase reporter. This promoter has a normal chromatin structure including distinct nucleosomes and enhanced transcription factor binding associated with chromatin remodeling (31.Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3039-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32.Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2003; 111: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an MMTV promoter regulating a CAT reporter that is transiently transfected into cells has a poorly defined chromatin structure lacking clear nucleosomes or evidence of chromatin remodeling. Differences in the activation of the MMTV promoter in these two configurations can be evaluated in the same cell by comparing CAT (transient) and luciferase (integrated) induction. UL3 cells were transiently transfected with phhCAT overnight, osmotically stressed by incubation with sorbitol for 3 h, and then induced with dexamethasone for the final hour. The medium was replaced with DMEM + 10% serum overnight to allow translation of CAT and luciferase transcripts. Hormone-dependent transcription from the luciferase reporter was reduced to 40% of control by osmotic stress, whereas the CAT reporter induction was unaffected by these conditions (Fig. 3). This indicates that a normal chromatin structure or a normal chromatin-dependent mechanism is required for the promoter to respond to hypertonic stress. Moreover, it signifies that osmotic stress is a member of the group of environmental stressors that has a chromatin-dependent component. Histone H3 phosphorylation at the MMTV promoter was analyzed by ChIP using antibodies directed to histone H3 Ser-10 and 28 with GR antibody and IgG as controls. The relative binding to a promoter fragment surrounding the GRE in nucleosome B of the integrated promoter was examined. Recovery was antibody-dependent; in untreated controls, recovery was ∼3.5% of input with anti-Ser-10, 1% with anti-Ser-28, 0.75% with anti-GR, and 0.25% with anti-IgG. The relative change in binding in response to osmotic stress or to hormone treatment is shown with the untreated control set to 100% for each antibody (Fig. 4). Histone H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation at nucleosome B of the MMTV promoter increases following hypertonic stress. Treatment with hormone reduces H3 phosphorylation in both the presence and the absence of osmotic stress. Histone H3 Ser-28 follows a pattern similar to that of Ser-10 phosphorylation. Hormone treatment increases binding of the GR as expected for this positive control. However, osmotic stress reduces GR binding both in the presence and in the absence of hormone. No difference in binding due to osmotic stress or hormone was observed for the IgG precipitated GRE (data not shown). The increase in H3 phosphorylation and the binding of GR are inversely correlated. Osmotic stress-induced phosphorylation reduces binding of GR, and hormone treatment reduces phosphorylation. Hormone-dependent transcription requires GR binding. Therefore, the osmotic repression of hormone-dependent transcription may result from the displacement of GR from the promoter or inhibition of the normal hormone-dependent increase in GR binding by histone H3 phosphorylation. Osmotic repression of the integrated MMTV promoter was examined over a 24-h time course (Fig. 5A). Cells were exposed to sorbitol for 1–24 h with hormone added in the last hour, and then the medium was replaced overnight before luciferase was measured. Osmotic repression of MMTV is a transient effect. Exposure to sorbitol represses the integrated MMTV with maximal effect at 3–6 h. Repression then attenuates to untreated levels by 24 h. Phosphorylation at the integrated MMTV promoter was determined for 0, 3, and 24 h of exposure to sorbitol (Fig. 5B). Osmotic stress leads to an increase in phosphorylation for both Ser-10 and Ser-28, which is maximal at 3 h and declines to baseline by 24 h. This correlates with the time course of repression of transcription. The time course of phosphorylation is the same in the presence of hormone, although phosphorylation levels are lower with hormone. A time course of transcription during osmotic stress was also measured on the transient MMTV to determine how the lack of chromatin structure affected repression and H3 phosphorylation. No osmotic repression of the transient MMTV was observed at any time up to 24 h (Fig. 6A). Histone H3 phosphorylation at the transient MMTV was analyzed by amplifying the ChIP products with a CAT-specific primer (Fig. 6B). Although phosphorylated H3 was found associated with the transient promoter, a change in phosphorylation was not observed in response to hypertonic stress. Inhibitors of several kinases were used to assess the contribution of different signal transduction pathways to osmotic repression and H3 phosphorylation of MMTV. In UL3 cells, p38 and JNK were clearly phosphorylated in response to osmotic stress treatment. However, inhibition with 10 μm SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, or 2 μm SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, had no effect on MMTV induction by hormone or osmotic repression (Fig. 7A). We also tested inhibitors of PKC and ERK because these kinases are regulators of the osmotic stress response in mouse cells (28.Zhuang S. Hirai S.I. Ohno S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C102-C109Crossref Google Scholar, 30.Zhao H. Tian W. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F710-F717Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and H3 phosphorylation by TPA (13.Huang W. Mishra V. Batra S. Dillon I. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1519-1527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In UL3 cells, we found no osmotic stress-induced ERK phosphorylation, and inhibition of ERK with 10 μm UO126 failed to affect repression. However, treatment with the PKC inhibitor rottlerin (2 μm) resulted in abrogation of osmotic repression relative to the hormone-treated control. Rottlerin also reduced hormone-dependent activation by ∼50%. Rottlerin reduced the effects of both hormone and osmotic stress on MMTV expression, although hormone and stress have opposite effects on transcription. Transcription from a transient MMTV promoter was measured in rottlerin-treated cells to determine whether this compound, which is toxic to UL3 above 10 μm, was non-specifically affecting transcription (Fig. 7B). Rottlerin had no effect on the hormone-dependent activation of the transient MMTV. Thus, rottlerin activity is chromatin-specific, affecting both the efficiency of hormone activation and osmotic repression only on a normal nucleosome-organized promoter. The effect of rottlerin on H3 phosphorylation in sorbitol-treated cells and on GR binding was examined by ChIP (Fig. 8). Although rottlerin had no effect on phosphorylation of total cellular H3 proteins, rottlerin treatment reduced the increase in H3 phosphorylation in response to sorbitol at Ser-10 on the MMTV promoter. Rottlerin also reduced the hormone-dependent increase in GR binding. On cells treated with a combination of sorbitol and hormone, rottlerin abrogated the decrease in phosphorylation. The overall effect of rottlerin was to inhibit changes in pH3 and GR specifically associated with the integrated MMTV promoter. This suggests that GR binding and H3 phosphorylation on the chromatin promoter have a common chromatin-dependent precursor step that affects the subsequent GR binding or H3 phosphorylation when disrupted by rottlerin. The effect of osmotic stress on hormone induction of endogenous genes was evaluated using real-time PCR of RNA levels (Fig. 9). Hormone treatment induces both the IκB and the GILZ genes. Osmotic stress treatment represses the hormone induction of the GILZ gene to 40% of the hormone-induced control. Thus, the GILZ gene shows the same pattern of osmotic repression as MMTV. However, hormone induction of the IκB gene is unaffected by osmotic stress in the same cells. EZF is induced by osmotic stress, and hormone treatment has no effect on the osmotic stress induction of EZF. The lack of osmotic stress repression on IκB or the GAPDH control suggests that osmotic stress repression is targeted to specific genes and is not a non-specific global effect. Change in histone H3 phosphorylation is a common response to many mitogenic and stress-inducing environmental influences. We have shown here that H3 phosphorylation is also a component of the cellular response to osmotic stress. An increase in histone H3 phosphorylation has previously been associated with specific stress-responsive genes and correlated with gene activation (12.Strelkov I.S. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 75-78PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G.R. Rampersaud N. Dyson M.H. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Arthur J.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24914-24920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, we found in the present study that the increase in osmotic stress-dependent H3 phosphorylation at the MMTV promoter is associated with repression of hormone-dependent transcription. Thus, H3 phosphorylation is a component of the osmotic stress response but is not linked specifically to gene activation. Displacement of several transcription factors is an initial response to osmotic stress at several promoters in yeast (38.Proft M. Struhl K. Cell. 2004; 118: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). HP1 is displaced from chromosomes during mitotic chromatin compaction, but HP1 is retained when phosphorylation of H3 Ser-10 is inhibited (39.Fischle W. Tseng B.S. Dormann H.L. Ueberheide B.M.

Cell. 2006; 24: 367-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Hormone-dependent transcription of the MMTV is repressed during mitosis when H3 is highly phosphorylated, and binding of the transcription factor NF1 to the promoter is reduced (42.Bhattacharjee R.N. Archer T.K. Virology. 2006; 346: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We observed that H3 phosphorylation of the MMTV promoter and binding of the glucocorticoid receptor GR to the promoter are inversely correlated. Moreover, H3 phosphorylation and repression are temporally correlated. This suggests that the increase in H3 phosphorylation regulates the displacement of GR and represses hormone-dependent transcription. Comparison of the osmotic response from the integrated versus the transient MMTV promoter shows that both repression and histone H3 phosphorylation require a normal chromatin structure. The transient MMTV promoter is accessible to nuclease digestion in the absence of hormone and binds the GR and other transcription factors more efficiently in the absence of hormone than the normal chromatin of the integrated promoter (32.Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2003; 111: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, on treatment with hormone, the transient promoter fails to exhibit a chromatin-dependent increase in nuclease hypersensitivity or increase GR binding. We have shown that the transient promoter is similarly insensitive to osmotic stress-induced changes in histone H3 phosphorylation exhibiting no significant change in phosphorylation or repression. The presence of phosphorylated H3 on the transient promoter clearly does not prevent GR binding but may contribute to the lower inducibility of the transient promoter (10-fold) when compared with the integrated promoter (1000-fold). Rottlerin inhibits several isoforms of PKC and abrogates osmotic stress repression of the MMTV (43.Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 181-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). A requirement for PKC signaling has been found for the osmotic response in mouse for both ERK phosphorylation and TonEBP-dependent transcription (28.Zhuang S. Hirai S.I. Ohno S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C102-C109Crossref Google Scholar, 30.Zhao H. Tian W. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F710-F717Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In mouse cells, osmotic stress increases total PKC activity and induces translocation of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε from cytosol to the cell membrane (28.Zhuang S. Hirai S.I. Ohno S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C102-C109Crossref Google Scholar). Dominant-negative inhibition of PKCδ or PKCε inhibits ERK phosphorylation but not transcriptional activation (30.Zhao H. Tian W. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F710-F717Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Histone H3 phosphorylation and transcription of the low density lipoprotein promoter in response to TPA in human cells is dependent on PKC but not ERK, which suggests that transcription and ERK signaling are independent osmotic responses in human cells (13.Huang W. Mishra V. Batra S. Dillon I. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1519-1527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vitro H3 is phosphorylated at Ser-10 by purified PKCβ or PKCε (13.Huang W. Mishra V. Batra S. Dillon I. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1519-1527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), so rottlerin may disrupt the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of H3. However, the effect of rottlerin on hormone-dependent GR binding suggests that PKC regulates a common intermediate and may not specifically phosphorylate H3. An alternative mechanism for regulating histone H3 phosphorylation in a PKC-dependent manner is chromatin compaction. The HMGN1 protein is a component of normal chromatin structure that binds to nucleosome core particles and modifies chromatin compaction (17.Trieschmann L. Martin B. Bustin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5468-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18.Ding H.F. Bustin M. Hansen U. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5843-5855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Lim J.H. Catez F.

The HMGN1-dependent changes in chromatin compaction regulate the access of kinases to histone H3. Like histone H3, HMGN1 is phosphorylated in response to mitogens and stress. However, HMGN1 phosphorylation precedes anisomysin-dependent H3 phosphorylation (19.Lim J.H. Catez F. Birger Y. West K.L. Prymakowska-Bosak M. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The lack of HMGN1 in knock-out mice increases the steady state of H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation (19.Lim J.H. Catez F. Birger Y. West K.L. Prymakowska-Bosak M. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). HMGN1 can be phosphorylated on several residues by different kinases. PKCα specifically phosphorylates residues in the nucleosome-binding domain of HMGN1 that regulate binding to the nucleosome core (20.Prymakowska-Bosak M. Misteli T. Herrera J.E. Shirakawa H. Birger Y. Garfield S. Bustin M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5169-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). HMGN1 bound to the nucleosome can block H3 phosphorylation by RSK or MSK (19.Lim J.H. Catez F. Birger Y. West K.L. Prymakowska-Bosak M. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). If HMGN1-dependent compaction can modulate the access of kinases to H3, it may also regulate the access of GR to the GRE in hormone-responsive promoters. The hormone-dependent increase in GR binding at MMTV has been attributed to ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. However, increased GR binding occurs in the absence of Brg1, suggesting that the regulation of GR binding is not solely attributable to that mechanism (44.Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 3347-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PKCα phosphorylates HMGN1 in the nucleosome–binding domain and regulates chromatin compaction, potentially modulating both GR binding and H3 phosphorylation. Rottlerin inhibition of HMGN1 phosphorylation disrupting decompaction could produce the similar expression in dexamethasone + rottlerin-treated and sorbitol + dexamethasone + rottlerin-treated cells. The regulation of chromatin compaction is potentially the common intermediary disrupted by rottlerin. Osmotic stress activation of several genes does not require normal chromatin. An Sgk-luciferase reporter and a tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein-response element luciferase reporter are both activated by osmotic stress when transiently transfected (26.Bell L.M. Leong M.L. Kim B. Wang E. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25262-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30.Zhao H. Tian W. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F710-F717Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This suggests that chromatin structure and H3 phosphorylation regulate a subset of stress pathways contributing to gene response and that loss of H3 phosphorylation does not necessarily abrogate activation. MSK phosphorylates H3 in response to arsenite and anisomysin, and deletion of Msk inhibits H3 phosphorylation but only partially blocks activation of immediate early genes (16.Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G.R. Rampersaud N. Dyson M.H. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Osmotic activation of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene has an H3 phosphorylation element that is disrupted by rottlerin, but the low density lipoprotein may be activated without H3 phosphorylation (13.Huang W. Mishra V. Batra S. Dillon I. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1519-1527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). If H3 phosphorylation regulates the displacement of factors that are normally associated with the promoter in the absence of stress, then clearing could facilitate the formation and binding of new transcription complexes at the promoter that contain stress-responsive transcription factors. H3 phosphorylation would then regulate both repression and activation of transcription. We thank Drs. R. DiAugustine and M. Garcia for thoughtful review of the manuscript."

Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). For example, electrophysiological recordings from Xenopus oocytes expressing NCX1 have revealed modulatory effects of both Na+ and Ca2+ on exchanger activity (3Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A.

John S. Qiu Z. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To further study these regulations, our goal was to engineer a full-length exchanger fused to a fluorescent protein with biophysical properties similar to the untagged exchanger. The cyan (CFP) and yellow (YFP) variants of the green fluorescent protein have been extensively used to visualize proteins in intact cells and to conduct FRET studies (7Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4983) Google Scholar, 8Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). The fluorescent NCX1 could then be used for in vivo visualization and to perform FRET experiments. Here we present biophysical properties of the cardiac NCX1 with CFP and YFP inserted at different positions within the protein. The data indicate that insertion of fluorescent protein within the large intracellular loop connecting transmembrane segments 5 and 6 is well tolerated, whereas insertion of the fluorophore at the C terminus of the exchanger leads to an inactive transporter retained in intracellular compartments. Either YFP or CFP was inserted at positions 266, 371, 467, and 548 within the large intracellular loop. All constructs were properly targeted to the plasma membrane and were active. Electrophysiological recordings show that the fluorescent-tagged exchangers retain both Na+ and Ca2+ regulation. We also demonstrate the proximity of NCX1 to plasma membrane PIP2 using FRET. Molecular Biology—Internal insertions of fluorescent proteins into the canine NCX1 were constructed as follows. An AgeI/EcoRI fragment was subcloned into pEGFPC-1 (Clontech). HindIII restriction sites were introduced at locations corresponding to amino acid positions 266, 371, 467, and 548 of the wild type protein sequence using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sites were primarily chosen to cover a variety of locations within the exchanger loop. CFP and YFP were PCR-amplified with primers enabling a HindIII digest to insert the fluorescent protein in-frame at the specified amino acid locations. All PCR products and QuikChange insertions were sequenced. The fluorescent protein-containing fragment was then reinserted into the wild type exchanger, which was either in the pGEMHE vector to make cRNA (Ambion, TX) for oocyte injection or in a pEGFPN-1 vector for expression in mammalian cells. Na+-dependent Ca2+ Uptake—Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake was performed as described previously (9Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells expressing CFP- or YFP-tagged exchangers were suspended and loaded with Na+ by incubation with (in mm): 10 MOPS, 140 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.4 ouabain, and 0.025 nystatin for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed by centrifugation, and uptake was initiated by resuspending the cell pellet in assay medium (in mm): 10 MOPS, 140 KCl, 0.4 ouabain, 0.025 CaCl2, and 5 μCi/ml 45Ca2+. The reaction was stopped after 1–3 min by adding ice-cold quenching solution (140 mm KCl and 1 mm EGTA). Cell pellets were then dissolved in 1 n NaOH at 80 °C for 20 min. Aliquots of sample were subjected to scintillation counting and Western blot. Transfection efficiency of HEK cells was typically about 80%. Transfection of NCX typically increased the Ca2+ uptake of HEK cells by over 10-fold. Electrophysiological Experiments—RNAs coding for the fluorescent exchangers were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. Oocytes were kept at 18 °C for 4–7 days. Outward Na+-Ca2+ exchange currents were recorded using the inside-out giant patch technique (10Hilgemann D.W. Lu C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled and fire-polished to a final inner diameter of about 20–30 μm and coated with a mixture of Parafilm and mineral oil. Prior to experiments, the vitelline membrane of the oocyte was removed manually in an isotonic solution identical to the solution for seal formation (in mm: 110 KOH, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7 using MES). After membrane excision, solutions were rapidly changed using a computer-controlled 20-channel solution switcher. Recordings of the outward exchanger current were obtained using the following solutions: pipette solution (in mm) 100 N-methylglucamine, 10 HEPES (4-(2hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 20 tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 0.2 niflumic acid, 0.2 ouabain, 8 Ca(OH)2, pH = 7 (using MES); bath solution (in mm) 100 CsOH or 100 NaOH, 20 tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 0–5.75 Ca(OH)2 (0 or 1 μm free Ca2+), pH = 7 (using MES). Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated according to MAXc program. Ca2+ activation curves were obtained by perfusing solutions with different ion concentrations. Data were fitted to a Hill function and normalized to extrapolated maximum values. Values are mean ± S.E. PCLAMP (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) software was used for acquisition and analysis. Data were acquired on line at 4 ms/point and filtered at 50 Hz using an 8-pole Bessel filter. Experiments were performed at 35 °C and at a holding potential of 0 mV. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were grown in 35-mm glass bottom Petri dishes in standard culture medium. Petri dishes were pretreated with either fibronectin (Sigma) or Cell-Tak (BD Discovery Labware). Transfection of cDNAs was accomplished using GenePORTER (Genlantis, San Diego, CA). FRET Measurements—Data were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope equipped with a ×40 oil immersion lens (numerical aperture 1.2) and the following filter cubes (in nm): 1) CFP cube (CFPF), excitation 436 ± 20 (bandpass), emission 480 ± 40, dichroic 455 (longpass, DCLP); 2) YFP cube (YFPF), excitation 500 ± 20, emission 535 ± 30, DCLP 515; and 3) FRET cube (FRETF), excitation 436 ± 20, emission 535 ± 30, DCLP 455 (Chroma Technologies, Rockingham, VT). LEDs (Lumileds, San Jose, CA) were used as light sources, two emitting at 455 ± 20 nm (royal blue) and one emitting at 505 ± 15 nm (cyan). The royal blue lights were placed in front of the CFP and FRET filter, whereas the cyan light was located in front of the YFP filter; LEDs were controlled by the camera-driven shutter. FRET efficiency was measured by acquiring images of the cells in the CFP wavelength before and after application of 10 μm carbachol to the bath (8Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar, 11Llopis J. Westin S. Ricote M. Wang Z. Cho C.Y. Kurokawa R. Mullen T.M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Tsien R.Y. Glass C.K. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4363-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Images were analyzed by quantifying the amount of fluorescence at the plasma membrane. These values were used to determined FRET efficiency (E), calculated as follows: E = 1-ICFPb/ICFPa, where I is the intensity of CFP emission before (CFPb) and after (CFPa) carbachol. Images were analyzed with the NIH Scion Image Program and background was subtracted before FRET calculations. Insertion of CFP or YFP within the Large Intracellular Loop Connecting Transmembrane Segments 5 and 6 Leads to Active Exchangers—One goal was to construct a full-length Na+-Ca2+ exchanger fused to either YFP or CFP with biophysical properties similar to the wild type exchanger. For this purpose, YFP or CFP was inserted at different positions in the large cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane segments 5 and 6 of NCX1. YFP was inserted at positions 266 (NCX-266YFP), 371 (NCX-371YFP), 467 (NCX-467YFP), and 548 (NCX-548YFP). Expression of these constructs in mammalian HEK cells produced marked fluorescence at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). Thus, insertion of the fluorescent protein did not disrupt targeting of the exchanger to the plasma membrane (use of CFP instead of YFP led to identical results; not shown). We observed that the translocation of YFP-tagged exchangers to the plasma membrane required at least 48 h and was optimal 72 h after transfection. At 24 h after transfection, fluorescent labeling of internal membranes (presumably endoplasmic reticular and Golgi membranes) could be observed. To determine whether insertion of YFP altered the transport properties of NCX1, we studied the activity of the fusion proteins using both Na+ gradient-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake and the giant patch electrophysiological technique. Fig. 1B shows the activity of the YFP-tagged exchangers measured as Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake. These data indicate that YFP-tagged NCX1s are active when expressed in HEK cells and that the transport ability of these constructs is not substantially altered by the insertion of YFP. Although NCX-371YFP, NCX-467YFP, and NCX-548YFP show a decrease in uptake when compared with wild type, immunoblot analysis indicates a decreased level of expression of these constructs when compared with the untagged exchanger (not shown). A diminished level of protein expression likely contributes to the reduced transport activity. The activity of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is regulated by both cytoplasmic Na+ and cytoplasmic Ca2+. High intracellular Na+ inactivates the exchanger, whereas micromolar levels of Ca2+ remove the Na+-dependent inactivation and also directly increase exchanger activity (3Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To determine whether fluorescent-tagged exchangers retain these regulatory properties, exchangers were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and biophysical properties were characterized using the giant patch technique. Similar to observations in HEK cells, all constructs generated intense fluorescence at the plasma membrane. Oocytes displaying strong fluorescence were selected for electrophysiological measurements. Giant patch experiments demonstrated that all YFP-tagged exchangers generate an outward exchange current in the presence of high intracellular Na+ (100 mm) when 8 mm Ca2+ is present in the pipette. The 8 mm Ca2+ provides a saturating level of Ca2+ at the extracellular surface of the exchanger. Fig. 2A shows representative traces of outward exchange current recorded from oocytes expressing the indicated constructs in the presence of 0.4 (right) or 10 μm (left) Ca2+ in the bath at the cytoplasmic side of NCX1. At low Ca2+ concentrations, all mutants displayed an outward current that peaked and then decayed within a few seconds. This decay is evoked by the high Na+ that drives a fraction of the exchangers into an inactive state (3Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 13Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This process is known as Na+-dependent inactivation or I1. The time required to reach steady state differed among the various fluorescent NCX1 constructs. The current decay was fitted to a single exponential to obtain a time constant (τ; Fig. 2B). The fastest decay occurred with NCX-548YFP and the slowest decay with NCX-371YFP. To estimate the distribution of exchangers in active and inactive states, we determined the fractional activity, Fact, defined as the ratio of steady state to initial current. Fact is a measure of the fraction of exchangers that do not enter the I1 state upon the application of Na+ to the intracellular surface of the excised patch. Fact for the wild type exchanger at 0.4 μm Ca2+ was 0.24 ± 0.04, whereas values for the exchangers with YFP inserted at positions 266, 371, 467, and 548 were 0.24 ± 0.02, 0.33 ± 0.01, 0.44 ± 0.05, and 0.49 ± 0.03, respectively (Fig. 2C). Thus, the fraction of exchangers that inactivated was significantly less for NCX-371YFP, NCX-467YFP, and NCX-548YFP. Higher levels of Ca2+ increase exchanger activity and also antagonize Na+-dependent inactivation. Fig. 2A shows that high intracellular Ca2+ (10 μm Ca2+, Fig. 2A, right traces) activated the tagged exchangers and removed the Na+-dependent inactivation in all cases. Overall, these data indicate that insertion of YFP within the large intracellular loop has only modest effects on the inactivation state of the exchanger and Ca2+ removal of Na+-dependent inactivation. We further investigated the effects of Ca2+ on exchanger activity. Inside-out patches were exposed to different Ca2+ concentrations ranging from 0 to 30 μm. Peak and steady state currents were recorded and normalized to their maximal values (Fig. 3). Points were fitted to a Hill function to calculate the apparent Ca2+ affinity. All constructs responded to cytoplasmic Ca2+ by increasing the amplitude of both peak (Fig. 3A) and steady state (Fig. 3B) currents. NCX-371YFP showed a significant decrease in the apparent affinity for Ca2+ for peak exchange current (K½ values are 0.57 ± 0.09 μm for WT and 1.42 ± 0.06 for NCX-371YFP; Figs. 3A and 4A). A more robust right shift of the apparent affinity of the peak current for Ca2+ was observed for the fluorescent construct NCX-467YFP (K½ = 3.89 ± 0.23 μm); Figs. 3A and 4A). Nevertheless, this exchanger retains Ca2+ regulation despite the insertion of YFP within a Ca2+ binding region (CBD1, amino acids 371–508). Finally, insertion of YFP at positions 266 and 548 left unaltered the sensitivity of NCX1 to Ca2+, although a large component (∼60%) of the current for NCX-548YFP was Ca2+ insensitive (not shown). In a few cases, a complete loss of Ca2+ regulation in NCX-548YFP was observed (n = 2 out of 5); nevertheless, a Ca2+-insensitive Na+-dependent inactivation was retained. A decrease in current was observed when Ca2+ was increased from 10 to 30 μm (Fig. 3A). This is due to the competition between Ca2+ and Na+ for binding to the transport site at elevated Ca2+ levels. Current declines as outward Na+ transport is prevented (3Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For this reason, Ca2+ regulation cannot be reliably quantitated at this level of Ca2+, and the data obtained at 30 μm Ca2+ were not included in fittings.FIGURE 4Ca2+ affinities of the fluorescent exchangers. A and B, a summary of K½ values for Ca + affinities for WT and the exchanger mutants measured either at the peak (A) or at the steady state (B) of the exchange current. Values for n are 7 (wild type), 4 (NCX-266YFP), 4 (NCX-371YFP), 6 (NCX-467YFP), and 2 (NCX-548YFP) for affinities measured at the peak and 4 (wild type), 2 (NCX-266YFP), 3 (NCX-371YFP), 5 (NCX-467YFP), and 3 (NCX-548YFP) for Ca2+ affinities measured at steady state.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to increasing peak current, cytoplasmic Ca2+ also augmented the steady state current by both recruiting new exchangers and removing Na+-dependent inactivation (4Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 12Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that all YFP-tagged NCXs had the same Ca2+ affinity as WT when measured at steady state (Figs. 3B and 4B). Strikingly, the difference in affinity for Ca2+ between peak and steady state currents, characteristic of the WT exchanger, was abolished in the NCX-467YFP exchanger. Tagged Na+-Ca2+ Exchangers Generate FRET with Fluorophores Targeted to the Plasma Membrane—To test the utility of our NCX1 constructs for further structure-function studies, we measured FRET between a CFP-tagged exchanger and a fluorescent acceptor separate from NCX1. We utilized the fluorophore YFP fused to a pleckstrin homology domain (PH-YFP), which binds to plasma membrane PIP2 (14Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We expressed NCX-266CFP in the presence of both PH-YFP and the M1 muscarinic receptor in HEK cells (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5A, top panels, activation of the M1 receptor by carbachol (10 μm) released PH-YFP into the cytoplasm due to the hydrolysis of PIP2 into diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Since the acceptor (PH-YFP) is no longer in close proximity to the donor (NCX-266CFP), no transfer of energy from CFP to YFP occurs, causing an increase of CFP emission. This is shown in Fig. 5A, where images of NCX-266CFP before (left) and after (right) the addition of carbachol are presented. Similar results were obtained using NCX1 with CFP inserted at position 371 (not shown). The fluorescent intensity of CFP was quantitated before and after carbachol by drawing a line across the cell to obtain a fluorescence intensity versus distance plot (shown in Fig. 5A, lower panel). Fluorescence intensity was measured from the peaks as representative of plasma membrane signal. The increase in CFP was then used to determine the efficiency with which energy was transferred from CFP to YFP (FRET efficiency; see “Experimental Procedures”) (8Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). The average value of FRET efficiency obtained from cells expressing PH-YFP and M1 receptor in presence of NCX-266CFP or NCX-371CFP is shown in Fig. 5B. In control experiments, NCX-266CFP or NCX-371CFP was co-expressed with the M1 muscarinic receptor and YFP targeted to the plasma membrane by fusion with the membrane anchor sequence of Ki-Ras (15Nagai T. Yamada S. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10554-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) instead of through a PH domain. In this case, the addition of carbachol to the external medium did not cause the release of YFP into the cytoplasm, and no changes in CFP emission were observed (Fig. 5C). The values of the ratio between the emission intensity of CFP before and after carbachol were 1.01 ± 0.02 for NCX-266CFP + M1 + PM-YFP (n = 20) and 1.09 ± 0.03 for NCX-371CFP + M1 + PM-YFP (n = 14). This result indicates that the increase in CFP emission in cells co-expressing PH-YFP, NCX-266YFP, and M1 receptor is not due to factors such as changes in focus plane or changes in the environment upon the addition of carbachol. The discovery that GFP found in Aequorea victoria can induce a strong fluorescent signal in mammalian cells has opened new opportunities for biological investigations (16Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). Indeed, GFP has been an incredible tool to study gene expression, protein trafficking, conformational changes, protein-protein interactions, and labeled cells in living organisms. We have engineered full-length Na+-Ca2+ exchangers with insertions of either the yellow or the cyan variants of GFP. These constructs can be used for both FRET and trafficking studies. YFP was inserted at four different positions within the large intracellular loop of NCX1. Insertion of fluorescent proteins within this region of the exchanger is well tolerated and leads to active transporters. In contrast, fusion of YFP to the CO2H terminus of NCX1 leads to retention of the exchanger within intracellular compartments (not shown). This result is in accordance with the previous finding (17Kasir J. Ren X. Furman I. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showing that manipulation of the NCX1 CO2H terminus impairs transport activity. Electrophysiological studies indicate that exchangers tagged with YFP within the large intracellular loop retain most of the biophysical properties of the wild type exchanger. Giant patch experiments show that all YFP fusion exchangers generate an outward current regulated by both intracellular Na+ and intracellular Ca2+ ions. Regulatory Ca2+ binds to a region distinct from the Ca2+ transport site, whereas Na+-dependent inactivation originates from the occupancy of the Na+ transport sites by three Na+ ions (3Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 4Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues that bind regulatory Ca2+ have been identified. There are two domains involved in the binding of regulatory Ca2+; residues 371–508 form the first Ca2+ binding domain (CBD1) (18Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Nicoll D.A. Sawaya M.R. Kwon S. Cascio D. Philipson K.D. Abramson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21577-21581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas the region encompassing residues 508–657 form the second Ca2+ binding site (CBD2) (19Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). CBD1 binds four Ca2+ ions, whereas CBD2 may bind two Ca2+ ions (19Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Nicoll D.A. Sawaya M.R. Kwon S. Cascio D. Philipson K.D. Abramson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21577-21581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of Ca2+ regulation and the relative roles of each Ca2+ binding domain are not clear. There has been substantial evidence that CBD1 is involved in increasing the rate of ion transport (3Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that CBD2 is involved in antagonizing Na+-dependent inactivation (19Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the apparent affinity of the exchanger for Ca2+ differs when measured at the peak or under steady state conditions (Fig. 3). When exchange current is initiated by the application of Na+, the exchanger is not yet inactivated by Na+, and the primary effect of Ca2+ is to activate exchangers and to increase the rate of transport (3Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) The situation is more complicated at steady state following the onset of the Na+-dependent inactivation (I1). Here, there are two effects of Ca2+ on the exchanger current. First, Ca2+ activates the exchanger (as observed for the peak current) and, second, Ca2+ relieves exchangers from the I1 state (4Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 22Fujioka Y. Hiroe K. Matsuoka S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 611-623Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The latter effect requires higher concentrations of Ca2+, perhaps due to the involvement of the second Ca2+ binding domain (CBD2). More detailed mutational and functional data are required to resolve this issue. All fluorescent-tagged exchangers have Ca2+ affinities identical to that of wild type when determined at steady state, although some exchangers had a decreased sensitivity to Ca2+ when measured at the peak current. This could indicate that insertion of the fluorophores within the large intracellular loop primarily affected the influence of CBD1. NCX-548YFP is of particular interest since YFP is inserted within CBD2 and still retains a similar steady state Ca2+ affinity as WT. However, the fluorophore is located in an unstructured region of CBD2 (19Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and possibly did not drastically disrupt the properties of CBD2. Nevertheless, only about 40% of the NCX-548YFP current retains Ca2+ sensitivity, and occasionally, we observed a complete loss of the Ca2+ regulation. Interestingly, in these cases, the currents retained a Na+-dependent inactivation not modulated by intracellular Ca2+. At present, these complications do not allow full understanding of the characteristics of NCX-548YFP and the relative roles of CBD1 and CBD2. Two fluorescent Na+-Ca2+ exchangers had decreased Ca2+ sensitivity (Fig. 4A): NCX-371YFP and NCX-467YFP. NCX-371YFP has a modest shift in apparent Ca2+ affinity, whereas the shift for NCX-467YFP is severalfold. It is interesting that insertion of YFP at position 467, within the Ca2+ binding site of CBD1, did not eliminate the Ca2+ regulation. Insertion of YFP at this position may have disrupted CBD1 without affecting CBD2. This could explain the similarity in the Ca2+ dose-response curves of NCX-467YFP peak and steady state currents for Ca2+. Possibly, CBD2 can modulate both Ca2+ activation and relief of Na+-dependent inactivation. Alternatively, insertion of YFP at position 467 within the unstructured FG loop of CBD1 (18Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) lowers the Ca2+ affinity of CBD1 without totally disrupting CBD1 function. All fluorescent Na+-Ca2+ exchangers showed Na+-dependent inactivation that was eliminated by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+. Mutagenesis studies indicate that the XIP region of the exchanger (amino acids 219–238) is involved in Na+-dependent inactivation (13Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the insertions of YFP at the two sites closest to the XIP region (positions 266 and 371) slowed the rate of inactivation. Possibly, this region is involved in transmitting the signal from the Ca2+ binding domains to the XIP region to modulate Na+-dependent inactivation. The cyan and yellow variants of GFP have been extensively used for FRET measurements. FRET consists of the nonradiative transfer of energy from a donor (CFP) to an acceptor (YFP) molecule. The two fluorophores need to be within 10 nm to generate FRET, and there must be overlap between the emission spectrum of the donor with the excitation spectrum of the acceptor. We demonstrate that CFP inserted at either position 266 or position 371 of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is in close proximity to plasma membrane-targeted PH-YFP as indicated by the presence of FRET. The result suggests that fluorophores at positions 266 and 371 within the large intracellular loop connecting transmembrane segments 5 and 6 are in proximity to the cytoplasmic membrane environment. The data also indicate that the exchanger is in proximity to membrane PIP2. PIP2 affects exchanger regulatory properties (23He Z. Feng S. Tong Q. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C661-C666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but association of the two molecules has not previously been demonstrated. We thank Drs. D. Nicoll and L. Hryshko for helpful comments."
